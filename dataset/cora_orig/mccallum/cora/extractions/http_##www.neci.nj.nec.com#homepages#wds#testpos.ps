Title: Chess Test A Test Suite for Chess Programs  
Author: Kevin J. Lang Warren D. Smith 
Date: September 1993  
Note: Lang and Smith typeset 697 Sep 2, 1993  
Abstract: We describe a suite of 5500 test positions for testing chess playing programs. They are available as pub/wds/ChessTest.tar.Z by anonymous ftp to external.NJ.NEC.COM. Almost all of these positions are unoriginal and were obtained by scanning in diagrams from chessbooks with an optical scanner. Gnuchess 4.0, at one minute per move on a 50 MHz MIPS R4000, scores 16-71% on our testfiles. We describe the software we wrote to accomplish the scanning task. If you take the test, please send us (Email: wds@research.NJ.NEC.COM) the results, the testee's name and estimated USCF rating, and notify us of any corrections in the test set.

Reference-contexts: For some purposes these combinations may not be difficult enough. Hence we also scanned the 879 positions in the second (hard) half of the "encyclopedia of chess middlegames" <ref> [1] </ref> and 50 positions from [12] which (Fine seems to think) are among the most difficult combinations ever played over the board. <p> Certainly the hardest ones would be difficult to solve over the board, even for a world champion. The easiest ones may be solved in seconds by an average player. We have also scanned in the 1745 positions from <ref> [1] </ref>, volume 3 5 . These expanded to 1797 positions, due to "two-in-one" positions. 2.6 Openings Unfortunately, we are unaware of any chess book analogous to "1001 combination problems" but which instead concerns the right moves to make in chess openings.

Reference-contexts: One then tunes the program's selective search heuristics to reduce this runtime. 1.1 Previous test suites There have been some previous efforts to devise chess test suites. The 300 positions from Reinfeld's "Win at Chess" [33] have been used by several authors (for example, see <ref> [3] </ref>), and are good for testing sharp tactical play (which computers excel at), but little else. CHIPTEST with singular extensions [3] scored 297 out of a possible 299 on this set, leading to claims that the best computers have "outgrown" it. I.

Reference-contexts: We scanned in the 495 positions from [13], of which 300 (allegedly) have a unique best move and thus are suitable for test purposes. The 48 positions from chapter 2 ("Find the plan") of [25] and the 33 positions from <ref> [6] </ref> are nearly all usable, as are the 24 positions of the "Bratko-Kopec test" (apparently mostly culled, in turn, from [17]) and the 25 "planning" and "analysis" positions from [16]. <p> Most of these sources provide fairly long textual explanations justifying the best move, but we only typed in the move itself, along with a reference to where in what book we got it from. Thus we have about 800 positions testing "positional" play. Strength vs results: Bellin and Ponzetto <ref> [6] </ref> claim that, "based on many practical tests with players of all categories," if you achieve a perfect score on their test you would have a 2760 FIDE rating comparable to the world champion but with a 50% score you would be about FIDE 1550, with roughly linear interpolation in between.

Reference-contexts: Our chess test may be able to shed some light on the debate concerning how much more speed is necessary to make a computer program become world chess champion. Experiments by Condon and Thompson with BELLE running at different speeds <ref> [9] </ref> had shown that each doubling of machine speed would typically yield between 40 and 100 extra USCF rating points in the rating range (ratings: 1350-2520; ply deep: 4-11) studied. (Stronger players gain less rating points from a speed doubling.

Then, to classify a new pattern, the system computed the dot product of the pattern with the weight vector of every class and assigned the pattern to the class for which the dot product was largest.

Reference-contexts: But this approach has obvious weaknesses, namely that (presumably) it is incapable of testing players who are stronger than the grandmasters who played those games, and also, there are plenty of positions in grandmaster games in which there is another "correct" move. Finally, Nielsen <ref> [29] </ref> describes a test set he has devised. The description was rather vague (for example, he doesn't say how many positions are in it, nor where they came from).

Reference-contexts: We combined 52 positions from Alekhine's greatest games [2], 27 from Karpov's games [15] and some well-known positions from openings manuals, in particular Keene and Levy's [22] and Znosko-Borovsky's <ref> [38] </ref>, for a total of 110. This test should be taken with the program's opening book disabled, since the purpose is to see how well the program would play in an opening position outside its book.
