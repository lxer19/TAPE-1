Abstract: 1 )-OT 2 . We address the question of implementing ( t 1 )-OT k 2 assuming the existence of a ( 2 1 )-OT 2 . In particular, we prove that unconditionally secure ( 2 1 )-OT k 2 can be implemented from fi(k) calls to ( 2 1 )-OT 2 . This is optimal up to a small multiplicative constant. Our solution is based on the notion of self-intersecting codes. Of independent interest, we give several efficient new constructions for such codes. Another contribution of this paper is a set of information-theoretic definitions for correctness and privacy of unconditionally-secure oblivious transfer. fl Supported in part by Canada's nserc and Quebec's fcar.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 surveys techniques for the construction of efficient self-intersecting codes based on our earlier work in [19]. Finally, Section 5 discusses open problems together with a new research direction we are currently investigating: an alternative approach based on privacy amplification <ref> [4] </ref> to the problem considered in this paper and to a natural generalization. The appendices contain proofs of the main theorems of this paper. 2 1.1 Oblivious String Transfer: the Basic Reduction For any n-bit string x, let x i denote the i th bit of x. <p> Examples With m = 2 this construction yields [27k=2; k; d] binary intersecting codes for k = 2N=3, if we use the <ref> [9; 4; 4] </ref> inner code of the simple family defined in Section 3.3. <p> Our new approach is based on privacy amplification, a technique invented in <ref> [4] </ref> and refined in [3].

Reference-contexts: We are currently investigating <ref> [5] </ref> another approach to the problem of reducing ( 2 2 to ( 2 1 )-OT 2 , in which A does not reveal the function to B until after the necessary ( 2 1 )-OT 2 's have been performed. <p> A drawback of this approach is that a new function must be generated and transmitted at each run of the protocol. We postpone our detailed exposition of this alternative technique because our research is still ongoing <ref> [5] </ref>. In particular, we wish to investigate the extent of its generality. 17 Acknowledgments We thank P. Barbaroux, J. Buchmann, I. B. Damg-ard, W. Fernandez De La Vega, A. Joux, L. Salvail and J.

Reference-contexts: In the other direction, a natural extension of ( 2 1 )-OT k 2 called andos (for All-or Nothing Disclosure of Secrets) was introduced in <ref> [6] </ref> but is denoted ( t 1 )-OT k 2 in the current paper: here A owns t secret k-bit strings w 0 , w 1 , : : : , w t1 and B wants to learn w c for a secret integer 0 c &lt; t of his choice. <p> Andos has applications to mental poker [10], voting [38], zero-knowledge proofs [2, 33, 41], exchange of secrets [7] and identification [21, 17], to name just a few. The main contribution of <ref> [6] </ref> was a reduction of ( t 1 )-OT k 1 )-OT 2 , i.e. an efficient two-party protocol to achieve andos based on the assumption of the existence of a protocol for the simpler type of oblivious transfer. <p> Nevertheless, our direct reductions are interesting because of their greater efficiency.

Next section is devoted to the general study of these codes. 10 4 Intersecting Codes Consider M as the generating matrix of a linear code. <p> The minimal distance d of the code is uniquely defined by M but is irrelevant at this point. Such self-intersecting codes 1 <ref> [8] </ref> have been studied in the past. For instance, Cohen and Lempel [8] have shown that the dual of BCH codes of length n = 2 m 1 and design distance 2t + 1 &lt; 1 3 2 m=2 + 3 are intersecting. <p> The minimal distance d of the code is uniquely defined by M but is irrelevant at this point. Such self-intersecting codes 1 <ref> [8] </ref> have been studied in the past. For instance, Cohen and Lempel [8] have shown that the dual of BCH codes of length n = 2 m 1 and design distance 2t + 1 &lt; 1 3 2 m=2 + 3 are intersecting. Retter [40] showed that most (classical) Goppa codes (see [34]) of rate less than 0.0817 are intersecting. <p> A corresponding upper bound was given by Komlos (reported in <ref> [37, 8] </ref>). These bounds are the following: 3:5277 &lt; lim inf T k k!1 (k) &lt; 4:8188: These bounds imply that, asymptotically, binary [ck; k; d] intersecting codes exist for c &gt; 4:8188 but not for c &lt; 3:5277. <p> In both cases, the convergence is exponentially fast in k. (The first part of this result is implied by the proof of Cohen and Lempel <ref> [8] </ref> of Komlos' bound.) This yields an obvious fi (k 2 )-time Monte Carlo binary flk-zigzag family for any fl &gt; ff. 1 For the rest of this paper we omit the word "self" as no other type of intersecting codes are considered. <p> If n (1 ")ffk, then Prob fM does not define a linear zigzagg &gt; 1 k : The proof of this theorem may be found in Appendix B. Although the first part of this result is implied by the proof of Cohen and Lempel <ref> [8] </ref> of Komlos' bound, we nevertheless include it in our proof since it is only one line. <p> Although this construction is limited to values of k of that precise form, a similar construction using an incomplete outer Reed-Solomon code yields a similar expansion factor for any value of k. Details of this generalization are left to the reader. 13 As observed by Cohen and Lempel in <ref> [8] </ref>, since the Reed-Solomon codes are minimum--distance separable, it is impossible that similar codes with a smaller minimal distance intersect. Since the size of the random inner code is also optimal in the sense of the previous section, we conclude that this technique cannot yield (2k; k)-zigzag for &lt; ff. <p> More recently, through this same construction, Cohen and Zemor [9] have obtained a better expansion factor (6.4138) for m = 5 using the binary [30; 10; 11] intersecting inner code of the dual BCH code type <ref> [8] </ref>. 14 Time Complexity This is the drawback of this approach: current constructions of AG--codes require O (k 32 ) operations.

Finally, Section 5 discusses open problems together with a new research direction we are currently investigating: an alternative approach based on privacy amplification [4] to the problem considered in this paper and to a natural generalization. <p> We need the following Lemma, first used implicitly in <ref> [19] </ref>: 12 Lemma 4.1 Let C o be an [n o ; k o ; d o ] intersecting code over F q m and C i be an [n i ; k i ; d i ] intersecting code over F q with m = k i . <p> By assumption, these blocks intersect and thus c 0 and c 1 intersect as well. The following constructions are based on a simple observation of <ref> [19] </ref>: if M defines an [n; k; d] code for some d &gt; n 2 then it must intersect (by a pigeon-hole argument: any two codewords of such a code intersect). <p> Therefore, the exponential time necessary to check if a random matrix defines a zigzag becomes negligible with respect to the full size of the matrix. Joe Kilian [32] inspired by the concatenation method of <ref> [19] </ref> has exploited this into a Las Vegas construction of intersecting codes that we now describe. <p> The total average running time is therefore in O (k 2 ) since k = m2 m1 . 4.4 Deterministic Construction a la Goppa An alternative to Reed-Solomon codes for getting outer codes with d &gt; n=2, first put forward by Crepeau and Santha <ref> [19] </ref>, is to use algebraic-geometric (AG) codes of Goppa [27]. We rely on the work of Katsman, Tsfasman and Vladut~ [29] for their polynomial construction. <p> Examples With m = 2 this construction yields [27k=2; k; d] binary intersecting codes for k = 2N=3, if we use the [9; 4; 4] inner code of the simple family defined in Section 3.3. If, as in <ref> [19] </ref>, we restrict our attention to inner codes that are members of that family, the best field is F 256 with an expansion factor of 7:7885, that is m = 4 yielding [405k=52; k; d] binary intersecting codes for k = 52N=15.

Reference-contexts: A is willing to collaborate provided that B does not learn any information about w c , but B will not participate if A can obtain information about c. Independently from [43] but inspired by [39], a natural restriction of this primitive was introduced subsequently in <ref> [20] </ref> with applications to contract signing protocols: One-out-of-two Bit Oblivious Transfer, denoted ( 2 1 )-OT 2 , concerns the case k = 1 in which w 0 and w 1 are single-bit secrets, generally called b 0 and b 1 in that case.

Reference-contexts: For instance, Cohen and Lempel [8] have shown that the dual of BCH codes of length n = 2 m 1 and design distance 2t + 1 &lt; 1 3 2 m=2 + 3 are intersecting. Retter [40] showed that most (classical) Goppa codes (see <ref> [34] </ref>) of rate less than 0.0817 are intersecting.

Unfortunately, for binary codes, Plotkin's bound <ref> [34] </ref> implies that [n; k; n 2 + 1] codes can only exist for n &gt; 2 k , which would result in terribly wasteful zigzags. <p> Thus, although the construction is polynomial-time, it is quite impractical. 4.5 Deterministic Construction a la Justesen We now take a deterministic approach similar to the construction of Justesen <ref> [34] </ref> for efficiently constructible good families of codes. <p> The number of non-zero words of length n = (a + 1)m and weight less or equal to fln is <ref> [34] </ref> fl (a+1)m X i (q 1) i q (a+1)mh q (fl) : Since each such word belongs to a single code, only q (a+1)mh q (fl) of these codes may have minimal distance smaller than or equal to fln.

Reference-contexts: These notions have been defined before for general protocols by Crepeau [13], Micali and Rogaway <ref> [36] </ref> and Beaver [1] using simulators. In this paper, we use the language of information theory to express definitions similar to those introduced by Crepeau [14]. <p> This second condition, called awareness in <ref> [36] </ref>, is concerned with the future use of the outputs of a protocol. If the output of a protocol is to be used later in another protocol we wish to guarantee that the output distribution of the first protocol corresponds to the expected output distribution prescribed by the task definition. <p> Otherwise trouble may force a party to abort and thus disclose situational information about past executions of the protocol. Although some authors <ref> [36] </ref> insist that correctness and privacy must be defined together in the general case, the particular case of oblivious transfers allows for independent definitions.
