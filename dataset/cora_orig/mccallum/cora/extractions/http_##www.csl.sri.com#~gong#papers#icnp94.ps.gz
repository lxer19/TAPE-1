Title: Elements of Trusted Multicasting

Abstract: Multicast is rapidly becoming an important mode of communication as well as a good platform for building group-oriented services. However, to be used for trusted communication, current multicast schemes must be supplemented by mechanisms for protecting traffic, controlling participation, and restricting access of unauthorized users to the data exchanged by the participants. In this paper, we consider fundamental security issues in building a trusted multicast facility. We discuss techniques for group-based data encryption, authentication of participants, and preventing unauthorized transmissions and receptions.

Reference-contexts: There is a very rich body of literature on the topic of authentication and delegation in distributed systems (see <ref> [1] </ref> for references). Thus we only concentrate on the extension of the basic pairwise authentication model to the internal and external authentication of all existing members of a multicast session as a group. There are two distinct issues here.

Reference-contexts: However, in integrated networks like Internet or ATM, multicast traffic shares network resources with other traffic. Such integration allows a quick setup and flexible maintenance of multi-cast sessions, but it also brings about serious security and trust issues. In the current Internet-based IP-Multicast design <ref> [5, 2] </ref>, for example, a broadcast message is not guaranteed to arrive at only the intended destinations. <p> We conclude with an overview of related prior work and directions for future work. 2 New Challenges in Multicast Due to page limit, we skip an overview of existing network multicast mechanisms and refer the reader to the following references <ref> [5, 6, 15, 2] </ref>. <p> If the distribution is by multiple source-based trees, a typical receiver is likely to shift attention from source to source thereby changes frequently its attachment to the respective source-trees. Even if the distribution is over a single core-based tree <ref> [2] </ref>, a receiver changes its resource allocation on that tree to reflect the shifting emphases on different sources. Both resource allocation and establishing and disconnecting path involve actions by multicast agent residing at network nodes. As was argued above, requiring the sources to mediate these actions reduces efficiency and performance.

Reference-contexts: Many Internet sites have already started filtering incoming and outgoing packets, but mostly for different reasons. Alternatively, ideas similar to those developed for the Visa protocol <ref> [7] </ref> can also be used. <p> Another related work is IP-Multicast [5, 6].

The Visa protocol controls the movement of datagrams (and thus the use of network resources) on a per user basis whereas in trusted multicast the granularity may need to be finer.

Reference-contexts: Notice that each pair of members must now share a distinct encryption key, thus the O (n 2 ) keys problem seems to persist. However, there are methods to reduce the complexity from O (n 2 ) to O (n) <ref> [10] </ref>. Encryption mode. It is generally undesirable to use the basic Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode because each block is independently encrypted thus the mode is more vulnerable to slicing attacks (e.g., by reordering blocks) and cryptanalysis.

Reference-contexts: To broadcast a message, a member chooses an encryption key (for use in DES) at random and encrypts the message. The member then signs a timestamp (to defend against replay attacks), the DES key, and a one-way hash function <ref> [12] </ref> of the original message (to serve as an integrity checksum), using its private key. The member then encrypts this signature with each other member's public key. <p> Moreover, the computation of a one-way hash function can be very efficient, and the checksum adds only a few extra bytes <ref> [12] </ref>. To use this broadcast primitive, session members receive and cache others' public keys and other relevant data.

Reference-contexts: Suppose each member has a pair of public and private keys, for example, for use in the RSA cryptosys-tem <ref> [13] </ref>. Each member must have knowledge of the group membership at least he must know the public keys of all the other members. To broadcast a message, a member chooses an encryption key (for use in DES) at random and encrypts the message.

Reference-contexts: In such cases, it is conceptually simpler to view partial streams as many layers of the same stream, and techniques developed for Heterogeneous Multicast (HMC) <ref> [14] </ref> can be used to explore the concept of mul-ticast sessions in which users participate at different bandwidth levels. Session advertising. Many services need to be advertised. The existence of a registered session can be announced, e.g., by a bulletin board service. <p> However, there were no architecture and protocols for secure multicasting. The Visa protocol controls the movement of datagrams (and thus the use of network resources) on a per user basis whereas in trusted multicast the granularity may need to be finer. Heterogeneous Multicast (HMC) <ref> [14] </ref> explores the concept of multicast sessions in which users participate at different bandwidth levels. This concept can be extended into multicast at different security levels.
