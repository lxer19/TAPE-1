Abstract: We address a discrete tomography problem that arises in the study of the atomic structure of crystal lattices. A polyatomic structure T can be defined as an integer lattice in dimension D 2, whose points may be occupied by c distinct types of atoms. To "analyze" T , we conduct ` measurements that we call discrete X-rays. A discrete X-ray in direction ~ determines the number of atoms of each type on each line parallel to ~. Given ` such non-parallel X-rays, we wish to reconstruct T . The complexity of the problem for c = 1 (one atom type) has been completely determined by Gardner, Gritzmann and Prangerberg [5], who proved that the problem is NP-complete for any dimension D 2 and ` 3 non-parallel X-rays, and that it can be solved in polynomial time otherwise [9]. The NP-completeness result above clearly extends to any c 2, and therefore when studying the polyatomic case we can assume that ` = 2. As shown in another article by the same authors, [4], this problem is also NP-complete for c 6 atoms, even for dimension D = 2 and axis-parallel X-rays. The authors of [4] conjecture that the problem remains NP-complete for c = 3; 4; 5, although, as they point out, the proof idea in [4] does not seem to extend to c 5. We resolve the conjecture from [4] by proving that the problem is indeed NP-complete for c 3 in 2D, even for axis-parallel X-rays. Our construction relies heavily on some structure results for the realizations of 0-1 matrices with given row and column sums.

Reference-contexts: In addition to reconstruction, Ryser and others studied various structural properties of 0-1 matrices with given row and column sums, and our construction relies heavily on some results in this area. Interested readers are referred to an excellent survey by Brualdi <ref> [1] </ref>. The general idea of the proof is explained in Section 2. In Section 3, we review the structural properties of 0-1 matrices with given row and column sums that are needed for our proof. Using these properties, we prove the Skew-Mirror Lemma in Section 4. <p> We now show that, using the structure function, it is possible to characterize consistent sums. An integer vector z = (z 1 ; : : : ; z p ) will be called monotone if z 1 : : : z p . Lemma 1 <ref> [1] </ref> Monotone vectors x; y are consistent if and only if t kl 0 for all k; l = 1; : : : ; p. The implication ()) in Lemma 1 follows directly from Equation (1). <p> The implication ()) in Lemma 1 follows directly from Equation (1). The implication (() can be proven constructively by giving an algorithm that produces a realization T for any pair (x; y) for which the structure function is non-negative. (See <ref> [1] </ref> for details.) It is also not hard to see that Lemma 1 can be derived from the Max-Flow-Min-Cut theorem for network flows. 5 Decomposed realizations. We say that T is (k; l)-decomposed if T kl consists only of 0's and T kl consists only of 1's. <p> We say that T is (k; l)-decomposed if T kl consists only of 0's and T kl consists only of 1's. The lemma below follows immediately from Equation (1), and it will play a major role in this paper. Lemma 2 <ref> [1] </ref> Suppose that T is a realization of (x; y), and let 0 k; l p. Then t kl = 0 if and only if T is (k; l)-decomposed. <p> Since it is known that 1-CCP can be solved efficiently in polynomial time (see <ref> [1] </ref>), the only unresolved case is for c = 2.

We resolve the conjecture from [4] by proving that the problem is indeed NP-hard for c = 3 (and thus for any larger c as well) in 2D, even for the orthogonal case, that is, with axis-parallel X-rays. <p> More specifically, we concentrate on the following decision problem: c-Color Consistency Problem (c-CCP) Instance: row and column sums I = (r a ; s a ) a2 , where jj = c; Query: Is I consistent? Gardner, Gritzmann and Prangerberg proved in <ref> [4] </ref> that 6-CCP is NP-complete. In this paper we prove that 3-CCP is NP-complete. If we restrict ourselves further to just one atom (that is, 1-CCP), the problem becomes equivalent to the reconstruction of 0-1 matrices from the row and column sums a problem predating the discrete tomography research. <p> An idea similar to the one described above was used by Gardner, Gritzmann and Prangerberg <ref> [4] </ref> (they used a reduction from a different problem, not Vertex Cover). Using 4 atoms they constructed, in essence, what we call a frame, obtaining the NP-completeness proof for 6 atoms. <p> We were able to construct the frame gadget with only 3 atoms, reducing the total number of atoms to 5. However, this idea does not work when fewer than 5 atoms are available. As pointed out by <ref> [4] </ref>, a new approach is needed. The main idea behind our proof is this: Define a partial order "" on all K-element vertex sets (candidate vertex covers). <p> simply note that all but two atom types have unique realizations which are independent of the given instance G; K of Vertex Cover, and associate the entries not occupied by these atoms with the edges of the resulting graph H. (Another proof can be obtained by modifying the proof in <ref> [4] </ref> in a similar fashion.) The argument above does not imply that 2-CCP is NP-complete, since the graphs corresponding to the 2-CCP problem are complete bipartite graphs. This leads to the following open problem: Can 2-CI2LF be solved in polynomial time for complete bipartite graphs? Consequences to data security problems. <p> This leads to the following open problem: Can 2-CI2LF be solved in polynomial time for complete bipartite graphs? Consequences to data security problems. Similar to <ref> [4] </ref>, our result has some consequences for problems arising in statistics and data security. The reconstruction problem for contingency tables is similar to the 1-CCP problem, except that now we allow a realization to contain any non-negative integers (not just 0's and 1's). <p> Irving and Jerrum [7] proved that this problem is NP-hard even when all file sums are either 0 or 1. The work in <ref> [4] </ref> implies that the problem is NP-hard for L fi L fi 7 tables and all file sums equal 1. Our result improves this result further to tables of size L fi L fi 4.
