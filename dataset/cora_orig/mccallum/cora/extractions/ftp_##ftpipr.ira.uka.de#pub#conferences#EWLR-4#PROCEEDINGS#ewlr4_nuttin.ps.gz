Abstract: This work presents a learning approach for industrial assembly tasks. It was developed in the framework of the ESPRIT project B-Learn II (Kaiser et al., 1994). Compared to "top-down model-based" approaches, "data driven learning" approaches offer several advantages, such as (1) faster development (2) easier implementation and (3) computationally less expensive on-line. Model-based approaches become very complex for real-world geometries and are ill-conditioned for relatively small objects. The test case consists of the insertion of an electric switch into a fixture. The learning task is to find the correct fixture position based on measured contact forces. Regression trees are compared with the cascade correlation architecture. Experiments with a KUKA industrial robot equipped with a force/torque sensor, validate the approach. Another contribution of this work is that the problem of tolerances is identified and assessed. The reported experiments show the effect of tolerances on learning performance.

Reference-contexts: Let us also define the prediction error E f j E i (t) = i (t) ANN;CART;F C;::: f j i;MEASURED (t): (6) The subscript ANN, CART or FC refers to the function approximator representation that is used: neural nets (ANN), classification and regression trees (CART) <ref> (Breiman et al., 1984) </ref> and fuzzy control-like function approximators (FC), e.g. the automatically generated ones of (Baroglio et al., 1996).

For regression trees, a function value is associated with each terminal node. The algorithms to build these trees are based on <ref> (Breiman et al., 1984) </ref>. A regression tree CART was trained using the training and the pruning set. On the independent test set, containing 1500 examples, the mean, and standard deviation of the absolute value of the prediction error is calculated. These errors are reported in tables 1 and 2.

Reference-contexts: Using the notations of Craig <ref> (Craig, 1986) </ref>, A B T is the transformation matrix describing frame fBg relative to frame fAg, A B R is the rotation matrix, describing frame fBg relative to frame fAg and A P Borig is the vector locat ing the origin of fBg in frame fAg. <p> Learning A F T means learning 9 values; this can be reduced to learning 6 values if e.g. the XY Z roll pitch yaw angles r; p; y are used in stead of the rotation ma trix. We refer to <ref> (Craig, 1986) </ref> for transformation formulae. Let f j i (t) denote the ith component of F f j T at time t; f j refers to the fixture position, (e.g. our set-up has 20 fixture positions, j = 1 : : : 20, see Fig 3).

Reference-contexts: This process is referred to as learning. The presented approach becomes particularly useful if the uncertainty on the actual fixture position is large. A random approach is only feasible if the uncertainty on the actual fixture position is small. The task frame approach <ref> (De Schutter and Van Brussel, 1988) </ref> can only compensate small deviations. Several contact situations occur where the forces do not "guide" the base part to the desired position. In fact, as both the base part and the fixture have a complex geometry, many types of contacts can occur. <p> These contact forces are expressed with respect to the sensor frame. The sensor frame is chosen as reference frame, because using the end-effector frame or a task frame <ref> (De Schut-ter and Van Brussel, 1988) </ref> requires computation of an extra transformation. Collisions are easily detected by monitoring if kF z k is between 2 and 10 N.

Reference-contexts: In other words, during training, the network grows, and the number of hidden neurons/layers change. The algorithm is from Scott Fahlman <ref> (Fahlman and Lebiere, 1990) </ref>. Figure 13d shows the network structure. <p> Fixing the input weights "forever", as explained above, has as advantage that the cascade correlation net does not forget feature detectors. Although the authors claim the network generalizes well <ref> (Fahlman and Lebiere, 1990) </ref>, in fact this is in our opinion the greatest problem. As with CART it is not a problem to reduce and specialize on the training set; but obtaining good generalization to a test set is not guaranteed.

Showing all insertions is not possible, we show (everything else would also have been similar) insertions number 300 to 500. neural nets with each one output. Experiments reported in <ref> (Nuttin et al., 1994) </ref> indicate that the latter approach yields more accurate results (for backpropagation neural nets). In fact, we even did not manage to obtain reasonable results using one cascade correlation neural net, with three outputs.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the framework of the European ESPRIT project B-Learn II, learning approaches for assembly skill acquisition have been developed and tested. Learning compliant motion control for the peg-into-hole task produced promising results <ref> (Nuttin et al., 1995a) </ref>. Those experiments show that learning techniques are able to improve performance in complex environments. In (Suarez et al., 1995; Nuttin et al., 1995b) a learning approach is presented for state determination while executing fine-motion plans.

Reference-contexts: Figure 3 shows the pallet, featuring the groups of 4 pins to support the base part. For an overview on the programming, scheduling and control of the assembly cell, we refer to (Van Brussel et al., 1993) or <ref> (Valckenaers et al., 1995) </ref>. The industrial robot KUKA IR-361 is used, equipped with a 6D-force/torque sensor. The problem of gripping the base part is not studied here. In order to be able to concentrate on the learning problem, the base part was directly attached to the robot.
