Abstract: This paper describes results of a dynamic model of aspectual composition that demonstrates how features necessary for planning and controlling actions can also motivate and ground simple analyses of a number of aspectual phenomena. A novel feature of the model is an active computational representation for verb semantics called x-schemas, an extension of the Petri net formalism that can encode goals, resources and other features affecting aspect. Vexing problems of aspectual composition lend themselves to simple analyses in terms of the context-sensitive interaction between verb-specific x-schemas and a controller x-schema that captures important regularities in the evolution of events. The resulting x-schemas can be elaborated and constrained by such factors as tense, temporal modifiers, nominals and pragmatic context, providing a rich representation that supports simulative inference in language understanding.

Reference-contexts: Lexical items can correspond to specific markings of the controller and affect the execution trajectory of the underlying x-schema; verbs in infinitive form refer to the entire graph. Cross-linguistic evidence for the model comes from the ubiquity of aspectual expressions that directly activate specific nodes of the controller <ref> (Comrie, 1976) </ref>, though we focus on English in this paper. These may be either lexical items (English start to V ) or grammatical markers (Tamil ind marks iterate; Mandarin le and English perfect mark done).

Reference-contexts: This approach incorporates observations from Reichenbach's (1947) classic analysis of the 3 Our model also accommodates perspectival shifts based on pragmatically determined time scale of reference (e.g., slow-motion movie contexts allowing He sneezed for 5 minutes). Further details, including the modeling of viewpoint aspect, can be found in <ref> (Narayanan, 1997a) </ref>. relations among speech (S), event (E) and reference (R) time, but we can more clearly characterize both R and E by projecting the controller onto a timeline, as shown in Figure 6.

Reference-contexts: They also, however, provide a cognitively motivated basis for many semantic distinctions that arise from the highly context-sensitive interaction between lexical and grammatical aspect, nominal semantics and tense. The dynamic model we have implemented supports fine-grained event simulation needed for inference in language understanding. <ref> (Narayanan, 1997b) </ref> showed how our dynamic model of verb x-schemas interacting with their controller x-schema could handle some subtle interactions between inherent and phasal aspects and avoid some well-known paradoxes and problems in other accounts.

Reference-contexts: A novel feature of the model is an event representation called an executing schema, or x-schema, an extension of the Petri net formalism <ref> (Reisig, 1985) </ref>. X-schemas are active structures that tightly couple action and reaction and are highly responsive to changes in both the environment and intentional state. Such properties are precisely those needed for controlling goal-directed behavior in a complex, uncertain and dynamic environment.
