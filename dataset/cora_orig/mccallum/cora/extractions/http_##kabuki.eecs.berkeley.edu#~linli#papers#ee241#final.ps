Reference: <author> Finally, </author> <title> we draw conclusions in section V. II. Design Specifications And Goal We assume a power supply of 1V and a load of 10pF. We also assume a standard 0.6mm CMOS n-well, single poly technology. The goal is to achieve a better performance than the conventional cascaded buffer in terms of speed, power and area. We optimize a conventional cascaded buffer by sweeping the tapering factor and the number of stges cascaded. The delay*area is minimized when buffer consists of 6 stages and a tapering </title>
