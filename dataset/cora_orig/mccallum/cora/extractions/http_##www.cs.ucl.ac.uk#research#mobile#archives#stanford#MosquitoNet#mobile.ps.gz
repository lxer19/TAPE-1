Title: Abstract  
Abstract: MosquitoNet is a new project at Stanford University for investigating operating system and application issues in mobile and wireless computing. Our initial goals focus on providing the appearance of continuous network connectivity for mobile hosts. To achieve these goals we must first enable portable computers to move seamlessly from one communications medium to another, for example from an Ethernet connection to a wireless modem, without reboot-ing or restarting applications. Second, we must determine how to manage the resulting dynamic changes in network characteristics, either transparently or through a simple interface between the network and the applications. Other goals include developing power management policies for network devices and experimenting with file data consistency algorithms for networks in which disconnection may be economically desirable, but seamless network re-connection is almost always possible.

Reference-contexts: Applications with certain retransmission policies (TCP) will perform poorly on a channel with high latency variance even if the channel has reliable packet delivery <ref> [3] </ref>. Other applications may not perform well with only intermittent connectivity. They may assume a link is down and abandon the connection even if the link is only temporarily unusable. Finally, the pricing structure for various communications media may differ by vendor.

Metricoms network costs only $30 a month for at least a 50 kilobit-per-second wireless link. The at fee per month means there is no reason to avoid using the service once it has been purchased.

Reference-contexts: As a prototype of what we believe future systems will look like, we are aiming for light-weight but fully functional computers equipped with several possible communi cations devices, including a relatively high-bandwidth wireless network. We have chosen to install the Linux operating system <ref> [14] </ref> on the Gateway Handbook.

Reference-contexts: However, the burden is on the mobile host to manage the consistency problems, since servers will not be able to contact the mobile host with consistency-related callbacks when the mobile host is not actually connected <ref> [17] </ref>. 7 Project Platform and Status MosquitoNet is a brand new project, and thus its status is very preliminary. We have spent most of our time so far investigating the areas we wish to address and equipping and testing our experimental platform.

Reference-contexts: MosquitoNet will also address this last type of disconnection through software techniques, as described in Section 4. 3 Providing Seamless Connectivity Enabling transparent switches between communication devices requires protecting the applications and upper layers of the TCP/IP <ref> [23] </ref> protocol stack from these changes. Each communication device, or network interface, has its own IP address. Thus the IP address of the source or destination changes whenever the source or destination host switches to a new network interface.

Reference-contexts: This involves structuring applications so they are as undemanding as possible with regard to their network connections. For example, many projects have separated some part of the graphical user interface from the rest of the application [10][21][22][28] <ref> [34] </ref>. Most of the interface processing is done on the mobile host, so that less data is transferred over the network. When data must be transferred between the separated portions of applications, the applications can use a communication protocol designed for low-bandwidth.
