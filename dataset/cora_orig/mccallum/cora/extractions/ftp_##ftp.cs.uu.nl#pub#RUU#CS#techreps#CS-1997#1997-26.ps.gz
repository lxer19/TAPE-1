Title: A Priori Scale in Classical Scalar and Density Fields  
Author: Luc Florack Jan Koenderink 
Abstract: Models involving fields often rely on details of a spatiotemporal scale range that is considered relevant to a particular phenomenon. We propose a generic representation for classical IR-valued scalar and density fields incorporating scale a priori. To this end a field is embedded into a causal, versal family with scale as the control parameter, such that no scale bias is introduced and physical content is not affected. Image data can be processed so as to reflect the source field's multiscale differential structure in a well-posed way. Physically relevant scales can be selected a posteriori .

Reference-contexts: The result is an interesting cornucopia of mathematical techniques for handling scale developed on an ad hoc basis. (Illustration: Prandtl's notion of "mixture length" in turbulent motion <ref> [1] </ref>.) Although each such technique may be quite satisfactory within its domain of applicability, it may be advantageous to have a general framework for "scale without physical scale" into which such techniques can be embedded.

Reference-contexts: This leaves sufficient leeway to endow with a strong topology, e.g. S (IR n ), i.e. the topological vector space of smooth functions of rapid decay, or Schwartz space <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This models the conceptual transition from a fiducial locus x pinpointed with infinite precision to a probabilistic one within a fuzzy -neighbourhood of x. In Tikhonov regularisation <ref> [3] </ref>, scale enters as a parameter controlling the amount of regularity. That these seemingly different approaches are in fact equivalent is most easily seen by their connection to isotropic diffusion (again in the resolution domain), which is itself a viable point of departure.

Reference-contexts: initial condition given by Eq. (12), a suitable factori--sation of t (z) (viz. by extracting a normalised Gaussian amplitude of scale p 2t) will turn Eq. (9) into a Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem formally identical to the stationary Schrodinger equation for a free harmonic oscillator, with eigenvalues identified with differential order <ref> [4] </ref>. A truncation of the family at finite order is most naturally studied in the framework of local jet bundles.

Reference-contexts: More precisely, iso-surfaces of solutions to Eq. (9) always end with a convexity towards positive scales (a result of the maximum principle). It has been observed in the context of front-end vision <ref> [5] </ref> that, given a few plausible symmetries, Eq. (9) is indeed unique with respect to this demand.

Reference-contexts: A final remark concerns canonical parametrisation. By scale invariance a natural scale parameter must be proportional to the logarithm of the natural volume element n . This is consistent with the fact that the information-theoretical entropy S [] = R Eq. (8) as proposed by Shannon <ref> [6] </ref> and Wiener [7] (for constant measure m) equals n ln up to an irrelevant offset.

Reference-contexts: The a priori freedom of scale poses a new challenge, which at the same time pinpoints a shortcoming of contemporary differential geometry: the understanding of deep structure, i.e. the unfolding of structure over scale, and its implications for field theories. Catastrophe theory <ref> [8] </ref> provides a handle, but has to be studied in the context of the p.d.e. constraint Eq. (9).

Reference-contexts: The generic event for 1-parameter families in general (stationary fields, say) is the fold catastrophe, which describes the Morsification of a degenerate critical point (zero gradient and zero Hessian determinant) into a pair of nondegenerate critical points of opposite Hessian signature. It has been shown by Damon <ref> [9] </ref> that this remains the case given Eq. (9), at least if the source field does not possess any special symmetries.
