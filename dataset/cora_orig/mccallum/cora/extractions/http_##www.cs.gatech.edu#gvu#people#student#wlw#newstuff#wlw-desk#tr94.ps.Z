Abstract: In this paper we describe a dynamic model and control system for a human platform diver. The dynamic model is a 38 degree-of-freedom rigid body model with dynamic parameters similar to those given in the literature for humans. The control system uses a state machine, algorithms for balance, and proportional-derivative servos to balance the model on a 10 meter platform, to generate the angular velocity for the dive, and to perform the maneuvers required during the dive. The motion of the simulated divers closely resembles video footage of dives performed by human athletes. The control and simulation techniques presented in this paper will be useful for analysis of sports performance and to as a source of realistic motion for synthetic actors.

Reference-contexts: The Jack system developed by Badler and his colleagues incorporates kinematic and dynamic models of humans based on data collected by NASA <ref> (Badler et al 1993) </ref>. The system allows the body to be positioned interactively and has several built-in behaviors including balance, reaching, grasping, and a walking behavior that uses a simplified dynamic model. <p> The assumption of simple revolute joints does influence the motion however, and a more accurate model of the shoulder and spinal column, such as those used in the Jack system <ref> (Badler 1993) </ref>, would make the motion look more natural. Joint range limitations and strength considerations were not taken into account in our model.

Reference-contexts: The forces computed with the constraint matrix are applied to the foot at the point of contact. The penetration of the foot into the platform and the velocity of the foot relative to the platform are used to stabilize the constraint equations using Baumgarte stabilization <ref> (Baumgarte 1972) </ref>. To allow the feet to leave the platform, the force is applied to the foot only when the foot has penetrated the platform a specified amount and the velocity of the foot is in the same direction as that of gravity.

Reference-contexts: Density data obtained from anatomical literature was used in calcu 3 angular velocity by moving the limbs of the body in the order shown in this diagram. lating the dynamic properties of the body segments <ref> (Dempster and Gaughran 1965) </ref>. The densities can be found in table 1, and we assume that the density of each body part is uniform. The mass of the dynamic model, computed using the polygonal model, is similar to measurements from cadavers (Dempster and Gaugh-ran 1965). <p> The densities can be found in table 1, and we assume that the density of each body part is uniform. The mass of the dynamic model, computed using the polygonal model, is similar to measurements from cadavers <ref> (Dempster and Gaugh-ran 1965) </ref>. We also tested the dynamic accuracy of the model by making it perform a back-flip maneuver without the presence of angular momentum (Frohlich 1979). The back-flip caused our model to rotate 70 ffi while Frohlich's model performed an 82 ffi back-flip (figure 4).

Reference-contexts: The data from film capture for three test subjects compared favorably with Yeadon's simulation. For many years, researchers have debated how cats land on their feet and how humans perform certain free-fall aerial maneuvers. Frohlich presents an excellent discussion of the techniques used by humans for aerial maneuvers <ref> (Frohlich 1979) </ref>. He describes the physical characteristics of divers and dives and uses this as a basis for describing different techniques for initiating somersaults and twists. <p> The mass of the dynamic model, computed using the polygonal model, is similar to measurements from cadavers (Dempster and Gaugh-ran 1965).

Reference-contexts: Diving is a dynamic, acyclic behavior with distinct phases and the control system we designed reflects these properties. Cyclic behaviors like running may require more sophisticated control algorithms because of the need to repeat the pattern with little variation on each cycle <ref> (Hodgins 1994) </ref>. Other human behaviors such as grasping an object or reclining in a chair are acyclic and do not rely as heavily on the dynamics of the system. The state machines described in this paper are less likely to be useful for tasks of this nature.

Reference-contexts: The graphical representation of a human influences the observer's perception of the motion. For example, when motion capture data of walking is played back as a series of light sources at each joint, the resulting animation gives observers the impression of a human walking <ref> (Johansson 1973) </ref>. However mapping the same data to a polygonal approximation of a human body raises the audience's expectations and allows them to see more of the motion.

Reference-contexts: The equations of motion were generated using a commercially available package, that generates subroutines for the equations of motion using a variant of Kane's method and a symbolic simplification phase <ref> (Rosenthal and Sherman 1986) </ref>. The dynamic interaction of the diver's feet with the platform is modeled using three-dimensional constraints.

Reference-contexts: While not correct, this assumption does not affect the motion of the diver substantially because they fall at a maximum velocity of 15 m/s and at that velocity air resistance does not slow the diver significantly <ref> (Van Gheluwe 1981) </ref>. We also assumed that the density of each body part of the human model was uniform and that the joints were simple rev-olute joints. Despite the assumption of uniform density the moments of inertia are similar to human data from Dempster and Gaughran (1965).
