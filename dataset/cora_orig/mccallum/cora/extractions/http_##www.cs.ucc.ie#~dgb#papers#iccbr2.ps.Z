Title: Similarity Metrics: A Formal Unification of Cardinal and Non-Cardinal Similarity Measures  
Author: Hugh Osborne and Derek Bridge 
Address: U.K.  
Affiliation: University of York  
Abstract: In [9] we introduced a formal framework for constructing ordinal similarity measures, and suggested how this might also be applied to cardinal measures. In this paper we will place this approach in a more general framework, called similarity metrics. In this framework, ordinal similarity metrics (where comparison returns a boolean value) can be combined with cardinal metrics (returning a numeric value) and, indeed, with metrics returning values of other types, to produce new metrics.

Reference-contexts: The value of v is also called the "excess of y over x". Similarity metrics are inspired by the definition of distance in metric spaces <ref> [4] </ref>, (1) being similar to a triangle inequality. In a metric space, however, the distance function is symmetric, and distances have a total order defined on them. In similarity metrics the order may be partial, and the distance function need not be symmetric.

As explained in detail in the remainder of the paper, a metric is a function that returns values from some lattice. Appropriate lattices include those defined on booleans, on numbers, on structured data values, on pairs of booleans, on pairs of booleans and numbers, and so on.

Reference-contexts: Recent work [6, 11, 12] has proposed the use of similarity measures that are neither boolean- nor numeric-valued. It is desirable that these measures also be part of a common framework. This is also achieved by our framework. See <ref> [10] </ref> for details. 1.4 Similarity Metrics: A Single Framework The work reported in this paper has three inter-related advantages. It proposes a framework in which different types of similarity metrics (returning boolean values, numeric values or values of some other type) are all instances of a single framework. <p> And a metric of any type may be combined, using connectives we define, with a metric of any other type, and the result will still be a metric. Proofs of the work reported in this paper can be found in <ref> [10] </ref>. Since metrics are lattice-valued functions, we begin our detailed explanation by reminding the reader of some lattice definitions. 2 Lattices Recall that a partial order is a reflexive, transitive, anti-symmetric relation. <p> Some lattice 2 In <ref> [10] </ref> we take the definitions of the binary operators t and u to be basic, and then derive the definition of the partial order: x v y x = x u y. <p> Again (2) gives suitable maxima. We see it as a strength of the framework that not only can boolean-valued and numeric-valued metrics be defined, but metrics of other types (e.g. set-valued as above, and feature-structure-valued as described in <ref> [10] </ref>) are also instances of the framework. That these different metrics can all be combined is another strength. 3.2 Generating Metrics from Metrics Inverses. If M = (E; L) is a metric, then its inverse, M 1 = (E 1 ; L) is also a metric.

Reference-contexts: An example case base. can be used in situations where cardinal information <ref> [13] </ref> is not available or is likely to be misleading. A retrieval request was presented as a pair, comprising a similarity measure and a `seed'. The values in the seed were the values against which elements of cases in the case base were compared by the similarity measure.
