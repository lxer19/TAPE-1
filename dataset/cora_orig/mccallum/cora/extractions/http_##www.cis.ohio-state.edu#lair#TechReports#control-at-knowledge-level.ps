Abstract: What is it that unifies the control task in all its manifestations, from the thermostat to the operator of a nuclear power plant? At the same time, how do we explain the variety of the solutions that we see for the task? I propose a Knowledge Level analysis of the task which leads to a taskstructure for control. Differences in availability of knowledge, the degree of compilation in the knowledge to map from observations to actions, and properties required of the solutions together determine the differences in the solution architectures. I end by discussing a number of heuristics that arise out of the Knowledge Level analysis that can help in the design of systems to control the physical world.

Reference-contexts: Techniques in the spirit of reflex or associative controls could be useful here. In fact, any technique whose knowledge can be characterized as compiled, in the sense described in <ref> [Chandrasekaran, 1991] </ref>, would be appropriate. However, there is a natural limit to how many of the situations can be covered in this way without an undue proliferation of sensors. So only the most common and important situations can be covered this way. Heuristic 3.

Reference-contexts: The literature on qualitative physics uses the word in this sense. This sense of qualitative should be distinguished from its use to stand for symbolic reasoning as opposed to numerical calculation. The latter sense has no connotation of approximation. which we do this in <ref> [Chandrasekaran, 1992] </ref>. The following simple example can be used to illustrate the ways in which we manage. Suppose we want to predict the consequences of throwing a ball on a wall. By using qualitative physical equations (or just commonsense physical knowledge), we can derive a behavior tree with ever-increasing ambiguities.

Reference-contexts: Of course, the model itself may be partly or wholly qualitative as well. de Kleer, Forbus and Kuipers have all proposed elements of a representational vocabulary for qualitative reasoning and associated semantics for the terms in it (see <ref> [Forbus, 1988] </ref> for a review of the ideas). The heuristics that I discuss below can be viewed as elements of the pragmatics of qualitative reasoning for prediction. Whatever framework for qualitative reasoning one adopts, there will necessarily be ambiguities in the prediction due to lack of complete information.
