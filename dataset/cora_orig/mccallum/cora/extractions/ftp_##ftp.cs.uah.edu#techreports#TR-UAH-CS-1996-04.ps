Abstract: This paper briefly looks at the various methodologies that are used to represent software requirements. One of the deficiencies of the various software methodologies available is that they do not use terminology that the user/customer can understand. One of the ways to help in developing stable software requirements is to make the user/customer as actively involved as possible during the software development process. Unfortunately, not many software requirements notation models incorporate the users/customers viewpoint or, if they do, not in a way that can be easily understood by the user/customer. The Requirements Dissection Model is designed in simple language that an untrained user/customer can comprehend, yet sophisticated enough to capture the salient features of software systems for implementation in the design of these systems. Six representative systems were chosen to show how this Requirements Dissection Model can be implemented. After analyzing these systems, the paper concludes with ideas for future research on the Requirements Dissection Model.
