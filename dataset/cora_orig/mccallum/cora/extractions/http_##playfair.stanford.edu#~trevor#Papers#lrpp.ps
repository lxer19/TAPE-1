Reference-contexts: We refer to this as the squared error logistic response model (SELR). This is analogous to the binary response model usually used with feedforward neural networks, in which the final response is mapped to <ref> [0; 1] </ref> by a sigmoidal function, and the error criterion is squared error on the [0; 1] scale. <p> We refer to this as the squared error logistic response model (SELR).

The functions are scaled to have standard deviation 1 and translated to have nonnegative range. <p> x 2 ) = 1:9 (1:35 + e x 1 sin (13 (x 1 0:6) 2 )e x 2 sin (7x 2 )) Training Data: Hwang et al. generate a single set of 225 pairs (x i1 ; x i2 ) with each component an independent uniform random variable on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. <p> However, as a single case provides little information on the overall performance of the algorithm, those results are not presented here.) Evaluation of the Fit: To test the accuracy of the fitted surface, a test set of size N = 10; 000 was generated over a regularly spaced grid on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 , with x ir = (2i 1)=200; i = 1; : : : ; 100; r = 1; 2: The error measure employed is the fraction of variance unexplained (FVU), which is given by FVU = E (g (x i ) g (x i )) 2 : where
