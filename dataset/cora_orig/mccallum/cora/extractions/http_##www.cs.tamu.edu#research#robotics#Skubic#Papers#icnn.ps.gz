Abstract: In this paper, we present and compare two methods of identifying single-ended contact formations from force sensor patterns. Instead of using geometric models of the workpieces, both methods use force sensor signals only. In the first method, fuzzy logic is used to model the patterns in the force signals. Membership functions are generated automatically from training data and then used by the fuzzy classifier. In the second method, a neural network architecture is used to learn the mapping from force signals to contact formation class. Experimental results are presented for both the fuzzy and neural network classifiers, and the results are compared. In some cases, the fuzzy classifier has better performance, and in other cases, the neural net classifier is better. The results are discussed, and, finally, a training modification is presented which dramatically improves the performance of the inadequate neural net classifiers.

Reference-contexts: Hara and Yokogawa have used fuzzy logic to recognize the CF from force signals; however, only a small number of states for one case was considered [4].

Although it was not used for an output, a hidden layer was designed to identify the CF. This neural network approach was implemented by Whalen but was not found to be successful when extracting velocity commands from human demonstrated data [9]. <p> Please refer to [8] for more details and classification results. classes and v vertices 4. The Neural Network Classifier Our neural net classifier uses part of the network structure proposed by Asada for mapping force signals to velocity commands <ref> [1] </ref>. The generalized architecture is shown in Figure 2. The 6 input signals are the normalized components of the force and moment vectors. The number of output nodes is the number of contact formation classes to be identified.

In this way, the learning process is simplified and the learned program should be more robust to discrepancies in position and orientation.

Reference-contexts: The final layer then maps the vertex points to the corresponding contact formation classes, thus providing the desired classification. mations: 5 sides, 5 edges plus the bottom surface (using 10 vertices) Training of the neural network was accomplished by using backpropagation with a constant learning rate (lr) <ref> [3] </ref>. The bipolar sigmoid was used as the activation function for both the hidden and output nodes. Training continued until the total squared error (tse) established an increasing instead of decreasing pattern. At that point, the training was stopped. <p> The attempts included adjusting the learning rate, using an adaptive learning rate, and using the Nguyen-Widrow initialization of weights <ref> [3] </ref>. None of these methods yielded significantly-improved results. As a result, a two-step training process was developed. First, the classifier was trained using a small set of prototype vectors.

Reference-contexts: The set of force and moment vectors that comprise all possible vectors for a given SECF form a cone, which reflects the motion constraints existing between the grasped object and its environment. A theoretical discussion is provided by Hirai and Asada in <ref> [5] </ref>. one significant feature is the direction of the vector. To capture the direction, preprocessing is used to normalize the data vectors. This yields a projection onto a unit sphere which indicates the direction.

Reference-contexts: However, since the CF was hidden within the network, we do not know whether his neural network successfully identified the CF class. The focus of this paper will be on classifying the contact formations from force signals, without using geometric models. We will utilize our previous work <ref> [8] </ref>, which is based on fuzzy logic, and also present a second approach using neural networks. The two classifiers will be compared by examining results on several Contact Formations training sets. In Section 2, the sensory patterns of single-ended contact formations will be discussed. <p> These are used as parameters to generate the membership functions, (r) = 1 e (3=jrj) 3 . A fuzzy conjunction operator is used to combine the 6 membership functions. In this case, the Hamacher product is used in its reduced form <ref> [8] </ref>. The combination of the 6 feature membership functions is interpreted as the possibility (i.e., a fuzzy number in [0,1]) of this sensor data set being in the specified class. In the classification process, possibility values are calculated for each class; the highest possibility number represents the identified CF class. <p> In practice, a threshold is also used to determine whether any classification can be made. In the current tests, the threshold is empirically set to 0.5. If no possibility value is above the threshold, then the data vector is said to be unclassified.
