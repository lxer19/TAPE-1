Abstract: This paper describes a computing environment named WBCSim that is intended to increase the productivity of wood scientists conducting research on wood-based composite materials. WBCSim integrates Fortran 77-based simulation codes with a graphical front end, an optimization tool, and a visualization tool. WBCSim serves as a prototype for the design, construction, and evaluation of larger scale problem solving (computing) environments. Several different wood-based composite material simulations are supported. A detailed description of the prototype's software architecture and a typical scenario of use are presented. The system converts output from the simulations to the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) for visualizing simulation results.

Reference-contexts: PELLPACK also includes an expert or "recommender" component named PYTHIA [21], [37]. Another system which provides a high level, problem-oriented environment for PDE-solving is SciNapse <ref> [1] </ref>, a code-generation system that transforms high-level descriptions of PDE problems into customized C or Fortran code, in an effort to eliminate the need for programming by hand. Other PSEs in the PDE problem domain include DEQSOL [35], PDEase2D [38], and PDESOL [33].

Reference-contexts: DOT allows the user to provide ranges, as opposed to fixed values, for the input parameters and get a solution that either maximizes or minimizes a given output value. DOT is a sophisticated engineering optimization subroutine incorporated into WBCSim. WBCSim examples use two visualization tools: Mathematica [39] and VRML <ref> [2] </ref>. Mathematica is used to generate static three dimensional graphs of the simulation output. The output is also translated to VRML. With a VRML viewer, the resulting graphs can be viewed from various directions in the three dimensional viewspace.

Reference-contexts: This has the advantage that the user need not know what subprograms are being invoked, and what data conversions are being done to satisfy a request. In other words, the user can concentrate on the intellectual aspects of the problem solution <ref> [14] </ref>, leaving data manipulation, management, and presentation to WBCSim. 10 (black), and the orientation of fibers in each layer. In this figure, the second layer has failed. The horizontal protrusions are proportional in length to the magnitude of forces being applied to the layers at the time of failure.

Reference-contexts: The RDS model predicts the moisture content and temperature of the wood particles for each cascade in the drum, and predicts the gas phase composition and temperature at each cascade. 3.2. Radio-Frequency Pressing (RFP) The radio-frequency pressing model <ref> [32] </ref> was developed to simulate the consolidation of wood veneer into a laminated composite, where the energy needed for cure of the adhesive is supplied by a high-frequency electric field. Radio-frequency pressing is commonly used for thick composites and for laminated composites that are nonplanar.

Reference-contexts: Other PSEs in the PDE problem domain include DEQSOL [35], PDEase2D [38], and PDESOL <ref> [33] </ref>. PSEs are being built for a number of other scientific domains as well. For example, Johnson et al.

Reference-contexts: Net PELLPACK [26], PELLPACK's 2 Web-based counterpart, lets users solve PDE problems via Java applets. Other Web-based PSEs include NetSolve [7] and NEOS [10]. Current PSE-related research projects that emphasize distributed collaboration include LabSpace [12], the Intelligent Synthesis Environment (ISE) [17], Habanero [9], Tango [5], Symphony <ref> [34] </ref>, and Sieve [20]. 3. Simulation Models WBCSim contains three simulation models of interest to scientists studying wood-based composite materials manufacturing. Each of these models is described briefly. 3.1.

Reference-contexts: The developer layer also includes tools to help developers get more from their simulations. In WBCSim this concept is implemented by integrating the legacy programs with an optimization tool and various visualization tools. The optimization tool provided with WBCSim is the Design Optimization Tool (DOT) <ref> [36] </ref>. DOT allows the user to provide ranges, as opposed to fixed values, for the input parameters and get a solution that either maximizes or minimizes a given output value. DOT is a sophisticated engineering optimization subroutine incorporated into WBCSim.

Reference-contexts: PELLPACK also includes an expert or "recommender" component named PYTHIA [21], <ref> [37] </ref>. Another system which provides a high level, problem-oriented environment for PDE-solving is SciNapse [1], a code-generation system that transforms high-level descriptions of PDE problems into customized C or Fortran code, in an effort to eliminate the need for programming by hand.

Reference-contexts: DOT allows the user to provide ranges, as opposed to fixed values, for the input parameters and get a solution that either maximizes or minimizes a given output value. DOT is a sophisticated engineering optimization subroutine incorporated into WBCSim. WBCSim examples use two visualization tools: Mathematica <ref> [39] </ref> and VRML [2]. Mathematica is used to generate static three dimensional graphs of the simulation output. The output is also translated to VRML. With a VRML viewer, the resulting graphs can be viewed from various directions in the three dimensional viewspace.
