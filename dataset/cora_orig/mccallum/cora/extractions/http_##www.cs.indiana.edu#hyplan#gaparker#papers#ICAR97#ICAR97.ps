Abstract: It has been shown that the use of Cyclic Genetic Algorithms can be an effective means of gait generation for hexapod robot simulations. They can, with only low-level primitives, produce reasonable gaits in minimal time. In addition, their output requires little in intermediate controller complexity as it is a sequence of these primitives, which can be fed directly into the robot. In this paper, we test the applicability of these algorithms on an actual robot. A model for simulation was produced based on the measured capabilities of the Stiquito robot. This model was trained with the CGA using five random initial populations; gaits quickly evolved for all five. Tests on the actual semi-autonomous robot showed that after 1000 generations gaits comparable to the best designed by human engineers were produced.

Reference-contexts: This issue has been addressed resulting in viable alternatives that are usually tested on simulations, but in a few cases have also been tested on actual robots. Marc Donner <ref> (Donner,1986) </ref> developed control strategies for the SSA six legged robot using decomposition of the task's elements and locality of control. He also developed a programming language, OWL, to provide real-time performance. Rodney Brooks (Brooks,1989) used subsumption architecture in the development of his robots.

Reference-contexts: Rodney Brooks (Brooks,1989) used subsumption architecture in the development of his robots. Randall Beer and John Gallagher used genetic algorithms to develop a neural net to control a simulated cockroach (Beer,1992) and showed that it was capable of controlling an actual hexapod robot <ref> (Gallagher,1994) </ref>. Although promising for robots with complex controllers that have a structure capable of using a priori knowledge of tripod gaits, these works have techniques that are inappropriate for small inexpensive robots that require a repeatable sequence of activations for control. <p> The CGA should be applicable to any robot requiring a repetition of a sequence of primitives for control; no other gait control is required. 2. THE STIQUITO II The robot used was the Stiquito II <ref> (Mills,1994) </ref>. It is a small, inexpensive hexapod robot that has many of the motion characteristics of larger complex robots. Control is transmitted through a thin cable connected to the parallel port of an IBM compatible computer or through an infrared transmitter connected to a Sparc workstation.

Reference-contexts: CYCLIC GENETIC ALGORITHMS Cyclic Genetic Algorithms (CGAs) (Parker,1995) solve the problem of evolving repetitive behavior that requires continual cycles of sequential actions. They are based on Genetic Algorithms, which were introduced by John Holland <ref> (Holland,1975) </ref>, and use the standard selection, crossover and mutation operators. They differ in that the CGA chromosome has a cycle of genes that can accommodate the cyclic nature of gaits. In addition, the genes can represent tasks that must be completed in a predetermined segment of time.
