Abstract: Aircraft ight pressurization/depressurization cycles cause their skins to inate and deate, stressing the skin around the rivets that fasten it to the airframe. The resulting strain, exacerbated by any corrosion that might be present, drives the growth of the initially microscopic cracks that are an unavoidable by-product of rivet installation. To avoid catastrophe, aircraft are periodically inspected for cracks and corrosion. The inspection technology employed is ~90% naked-eye vision. Of the ~10% that is instrumented, ~90% is with hand-held eddy current pencil probes. We have developed and demonstrated robotic deployment of remote eddy current and remote enhanced stereoscopic video instrumentation, augmented by image enhancement and image understanding algorithms, aimed at alleviating human performance problems and workplace hazards in inspection. This paper describes the aircraft skin inspection application, our two robotic deployment systems, the corresponding instrumentation packages we have demonstrated, and our progress toward developing image enhancement and understanding techniques to assist aircraft inspectors in finding cracks and corrosion. A wavelet-based approach is able to select radial features around rivets, and then to discriminate between cracks and scratches.

Reference-contexts: We have developed a library of monoscopic and stereoscopic image enhancement algorithms <ref> [7] </ref>. Algorithm selection, and the extent of high spatial frequency amplification applied, is controlled by the inspector via buttons and sliders on the IIW control panel. Several options are discussed in the following sections. Fig. 4: Closeup photo of CIMP sensor pod.

Reference-contexts: C.1 Surface crack detection algorithm C.1.a Background The crack detection algorithm that we have developed is modeled closely on the widely practiced test for detection of cracks using directional lighting <ref> [8] </ref>. The crack detection algorithm restricts its search to the immediate neighborhood of rivets, in a manner similar to the practice of inspectors. This is reasonable because cracks typically grow outward from rivet holes.

Reference-contexts: These observations motivated us to select a multiscale (multiresolution) edge detection framework for the detection and analysis of edges in the ROIs. Multiscale edge detection is defined as the detection of edges at multiple scales or equivalently multiple resolutions <ref> [9] </ref>. Scale implies the size of the neighborhood in which the intensity changes are detected for edge determination. In multiscale edge detection, edges belonging to small objects appear only at low scales or high resolutions while edges of large objects appear at higher scales or low resolutions. <p> In addition, Mallat and Zhong [10] have shown that the local shape of an edge can be characterized within the multiscale framework, by analyzing the evolution of wavelet 4 local maxima across scales <ref> [9] </ref>. This is of importance for crack characterization and detection, since cracks are typically of the step-edge type.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the multiscale edge detection process allows us to characterize the size of each edge by assigning a relative size corresponding to the object that created the edge. In addition, Mallat and Zhong <ref> [10] </ref> have shown that the local shape of an edge can be characterized within the multiscale framework, by analyzing the evolution of wavelet 4 local maxima across scales [9]. This is of importance for crack characterization and detection, since cracks are typically of the step-edge type. <p> Therefore the wavelet maxima values can be used to indirectly characterize edge types. We now show the use of wavelet filters in multiscale edge detection. We have chosen the cubic spline and its derivative, the quadratic spline, described by Mallat <ref> [10] </ref>, as our scaling and wavelet functions. Let and be the scaling and wavelet functions at scale s. Assume, without loss of 4.Wavelets are time and frequency localized basis functions.
