Abstract: In the usual formulations of the Miller-Rabin and Solovay-Strassen primality testing algorithms, to test a number n for primality, the algorithm chooses "candidates" x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x k uniformly and independently at random from Z n , and tests if any are a "witness" to the compositeness of n. For either algorithm, the probability that it errs is at most 2 k . In this paper, we study the error probabilities of these algorithms when the candidates are instead chosen as x; x + 1; : : :; x + k 1, where x is chosen uniformly at random from Z n . We prove that for k = d 1 2 log 2 ne, the error probability of the Miller-Rabin test is no more than n 1=2+o(1) , which improves on the n 1=4+o(1) bound previously obtained by Bach. We prove similar bounds for the Solovay-Strassen test, but they are not quite as strong; in particular, we only obtain a bound of n 1=2+o(1) if the number of distinct prime factors of n is o(log n= loglog n).

Reference-contexts: The interesting case is when D 6= ;. Making use of Lemma 2.1 and the estimate !(n 2 ) (log n 2 = loglog n 2 )(1 + o (1)) <ref> (see Hardy & Wright 1984, p. 355) </ref>, the probability in (4.2) can be bounded by 2 (log n 2 ) 1=2 + exp [ !(n 2 ) loglog n 2 1 log n 2 ] + exp [ log n 2 (1 + o (1)) 2 2 (log n 2 )

Reference-contexts: The term corresponding to f (t) = 1 contributes 2 k n to the right-hand side. For the terms corresponding to f (t) 6= 1, the polynomial f (t) is squarefree modulo each prime p dividing n, and using well-known character sum estimates <ref> (see Lidl & Niederreiter 1983, Theorem 5.51) </ref>, we can bound the contribution from all of these terms by Y (k 1) p = (k 1) !(n) n 1=2 : Therefore, nQ 2 k n + (k 1) !(n) n 1=2 ; and dividing through by n, the first statement of the

Both of these tests have the following structure. For each (odd) positive integer n, a set W (n) Z n is defined with the property that if n is composite, then #W (n) n=2, and if n is prime, then W (n) = ;.
