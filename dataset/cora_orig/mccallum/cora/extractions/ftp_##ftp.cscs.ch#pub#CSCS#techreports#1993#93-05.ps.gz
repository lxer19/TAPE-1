Abstract: As part of the Joint CSCS-ETH/NEC Collaboration in Parallel Processing, we are currently developing an integrated tool environment consisting of an extended High Performance Fortran (HPF) compiler, a parallel performance monitor and analyzer, and a parallel debugger for distributed memory parallel processors (DMPPs). The environment is implemented on top of a subset of the emerging Message Passing Interface standard (MPI), running on several platforms, among others a NEC Cenju-2 DMPP. We develop a sequence of prototypes, which are continuously evaluated by a team of application developers. This document describes the first prototype currently installed on our systems.
