Abstract: Active networking offers a change in the usual network paradigm: from passive carrier of bits to a more general computation engine. The implementation of such a change is likely to enable radical new applications that cannot be foreseen today. Large-scale deployment, however, involves significant challenges in interoperability, security, and scalability. In this paper we define an active networking architecture in which user control the invocation of pre-defined, network-based functions through control information in packet headers. After defining our active networking architecture, we consider a problem (namely, network congestion) that may benefit in the near-term from active networking, and thus may help justify migration to this new paradigm. Given an architecture allowing applications to exercise some control over network processing, the bandwidth allocated to each application's packets can be reduced in a manner that is tailored to the application, rather than being applied generically. Our results show that the ability to gracefully adapt to congestion makes a good case for active networking.

Reference-contexts: We consider three broad categories: Intelligent Discard. Intelligent discard is a natural extension of packet-level discard <ref> [1, 17] </ref>. Units are defined based on application semantics, and the entire unit is discarded if any portion must be discarded. Note that to be most effective, this does require buffering at the network node to collect a unit to ensure that the "tail" will not be dropped.

Reference-contexts: If the Internet Protocol (version 4 or version 6) is being used as the end-to-end switching layer, the AN control information can be treated as a "sublayer" or optional header, as is done for example with the headers used to implement the IP security architecture <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. What if multiple network layers are in use? For example, many IP internets today include ATM as a subnet technology, but not all traffic those ATM networks is IP traffic.

Reference-contexts: To let the router queues grow, we service the router queues at predefined output rates this is used to simulate various output link rates. We have also implemented a functionally similar ATM active network node, comprising a switch and an attached processor <ref> [4] </ref>. Circuits are routed through the switch to the attached "active processor", where the AN functions are implemented in user space; after processing, data is sent back through the switch and on to the destination. <p> A similar virtual memory and queue service strategy are used in the ATM version as well. Details of our experiments using AAL5 as the adaptation layer, and a null transport layer can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. 4 To allow for this, the network user interface could be extended to enable the application to specify AN control information on a per-application-data-unit basis, say as a parameter to the "send" primitive. 6 3 A Mechanism for Graceful Degradation under Conges- tion We now turn to the application of

Reference-contexts: However, if the same sender is transmitting at 1 Gbps, the uncontrolled loss when the bandwidth is reduced by 20% is 750 Kilobytes. 7 Note that the Available Bit Rate (ABR) service being defined for ATM <ref> [5] </ref> is also intended to relieve the two problems noted above. ABR reduces the time required for the sender to detect congestion by using resource management (RM) cells to convey congestion information.

Reference-contexts: For example, the control information for an intelligent discard mechanism (Section 4) should identify the various levels of data units to which the packet payload belongs: a block number in a file, a TCP sequence number, an IP datagram identifier. (Feldmeier's "chunk" labeling scheme <ref> [9] </ref> is an example of a possible encoding for this information.) The question is how to aggregate this information in a single location in a packet, especially if the end system's protocol implementation is layered.

Reference-contexts: One is that there will be times when the network will reject requests for reserved bandwidth and applications will have to use a non-reserved service or go away.

We evaluate this by applying each mechanism to a fixed rate, non-adaptive source.
