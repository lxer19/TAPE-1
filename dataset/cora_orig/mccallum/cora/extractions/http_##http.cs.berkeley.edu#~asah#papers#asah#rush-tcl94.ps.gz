Title: An Introduction to the Rush Language  
Author: Adam Sah Jon Blow, and Brian Dennis

Abstract: Rush is a new language that looks and feels much like Tcl [?]; we offer a compiler that executes scripts a hundred times faster than Tcl 7.x, allowing programs to run at speeds close to their C-language counterparts. Rush incorporates many features from Tcl and contains new features. From Tcl, Rush acquires its syntax, everything is a string model, set of core commands and datatypes, scoping rules, C callout facility, and support for popular libraries, including Tk and Tcl-DP. New features in Rush include pass-by-reference, first class closures and production rules. A generalization of operator syntax allows users to code in either command-style or operator-style syntax; a converter program provides a translation between the two forms. We introduce the language as a set of changes to Tcl, with a focus on performance issues and discussion of new features.
