Abstract: In this note we explicitly determine the steady state probabilities for an arbitrary circular Markov chain by successively reducing the number of states of the Markov chain. 1. Introduction. In this note we explicitly determine the steady state probabilities i for circular Markov chains. In these chains, the states are located on a circle

Reference-contexts: In the literature, this procedure is often used to develop numerical algorithms for calculating steady state probabilities for Markov chains or Markov processes (see e.g. <ref> [1, 7] </ref>). However, in the case of circular Markov chains it enables us to find an explicit expression for these probabilities. Two special cases of circular Markov chains are well-known.

Reference-contexts: Two special cases of circular Markov chains are well-known. On one hand, in the symmetrical case (p i = p and q i = q for all i) we are dealing with a so-called circular random walk (see <ref> [2] </ref>), for which we clearly have i = 1=N , i = 1; : : :; N .

Reference-contexts: Circular Markov chains play a role in the context of nearest neighbour random walks on inhomogeneous periodic lattices, i.e. lattices which consist of a periodically repeated unit cell, where each unit cell contains a number of non-equivalent sites (see <ref> [3, 4, 5] </ref>).
