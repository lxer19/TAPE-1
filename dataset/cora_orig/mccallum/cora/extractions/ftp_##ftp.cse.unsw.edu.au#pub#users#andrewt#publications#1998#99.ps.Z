Title: Reasoning about Continuous Change

Abstract: The problem of formalising continuous change within reasoning about action systems such as the situation calculus has recently been receiving increasing attention ([Rei96], [MS96]). In this paper we show that a long-existing systems theoretic reasoning methodology, that of Zeigler's DEVS (discrete event system specification), not only subsumes the standard situation calculus but is able to elegantly describe continuous change within a discrete description structure. We demonstrate that on the semantic level both Reiter's recent formalisation of continuous change within the situation calculus, and Miller and Shana-han's formalisation of continuous change within the event calculus fit neatly into a DEVS framework. Our results not only evince a significant connection between logic-based action formalisms and the algebraic formalism of systems theory, and between reasoning about action and discrete event simulation, but also provides support for using DEVS|a well-studied and rigorously implemented framework|as an underlying semantic framework for reasoning about action formalisms.

Reference-contexts: However following a several year hiatus since the publication of Sandewall's paper, there has recently arisen considerable interest in formalising continuous change within logic-based discrete event formalisms such as the situation calculus ([GLR91], [PR95], [Rei96] within the situation calculus; <ref> [MS94] </ref> within the event calculus). The principal result of this paper is that at the semantic level DEVS subsumes a number of the recently advanced proposals for incorporating continuous change into formalisms for reasoning about discrete actions.

Reference-contexts: As we are not dealing in this paper with inference techniques, we will not discuss their technique (we refer readers to <ref> [MS96] </ref> and [Sha97]). What we are interested in is the semantics of their framework. We represent a model of an event calculus as the tuple &lt;A,F,P,D,T,Happens,HoldsAt,Next,InfP&gt;. We define a translation from event calculus models to DEVS.
