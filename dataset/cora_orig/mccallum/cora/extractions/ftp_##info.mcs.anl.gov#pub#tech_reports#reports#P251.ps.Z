Abstract: We present a block algorithm for computing rank-revealing QR factorizations (RRQR factorizations) of rank-deficient matrices. The algorithm is a block generalization of the RRQR-algorithm of Foster and Chan. While the unblocked algorithm reveals the rank by peeling off small singular values one by one, our algorithm identifies groups of small singular values. In our block algorithm, we use incremental condition estimation to compute approximations to the nullvectors of the matrix. By applying another (in essence also rank-revealing) orthogonal factorization to the nullspace matrix such created, we can then generate triangular blocks with small norm in the lower right part of R. This scheme is applied in an iterative fashion until the rank has been revealed in the (updated) QR factorization. We show that the algorithm produces the correct solution, under very weak assumptions for the orthogonal factorization used for the nullspace matrix. We then discuss issues concerning an efficient implementation of the algorithm and present some numerical experiments. Our experiments show that the block algorithm is reliable and successfully captures several small singular values, in particular in the initial block steps. Our experiments confirm the reliability of our algorithm and show that the block algorithm greatly reduces the number of triangular solves and increases the computational granularity of the RRQR computation. fl This work was supported by the Applied Mathematical Sciences subprogram of the Office of Energy Research, U.

Reference-contexts: The issue of computing an initial QR factorization with approximate RRQR structure has been considered in detail by Bischof and Hansen <ref> [4] </ref>, and it has been shown there how ICE can be advantageously employed in this context. Schemes tailored to factorizations of dense matrices on various architectures are described in [1,3]. Let us now consider some issues related to the construction of the first Y matrix in the block algorithm. <p> Another pivoting strategy one could employ to limit the extent of column exchanges in ~ Y is restricted column pivoting. Here, at every step, only a selected number of columns can be chosen as pivot candidates. In <ref> [4] </ref> it has been shown that such a strategy is useful in computing approximate RRQR factorizations 14 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
