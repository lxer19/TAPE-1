Abstract: The overwhelming amount of information sources now available through the internet has increased the need to combine or integrate the data retrieved from these sources in an intelligent and efficient manner. A desirable approach for information integration would be to have a single interface, like the SIMS information broker [1], which allows access to multiple information sources. An example application is to retrieve all the menus of restaurants from Joes Favorite Restaurants site which have been rated highly by the Department of Health. This task, if performed manually, would require a significant amount of work for the user. An information broker, like SIMS, would allow access to multiple information sources, abstracting away the need for the user to know the location or query access methods of any particular source. SIMS stores knowledge about the data contained in each of these sources, as well as the relationships between the sources in the form of a model, called a domain model. The first step in creating the domain model is to determine which data instances appear in multiple sources, e.g. which restaurants from Joes web site, like Arts Deli, also appears on the Health Departments site. Once the common data instances are determined, the relationship between the data in the sources can be modeled in the domain model as subset, superset, equality, or overlapping A special case for information integration is when data instances can exist in inconsistent formats across several sources, e.g. the restaurant Arts Deli can appear as Arts Delicatessen in another source. For the integration process each source can be seen as a relation; therefore, integrating the sources requires performing a join on the two relations by comparing the instances of the primary keys. Since the instances have inconsistent formats, some mapping information is needed to map one instance to another e.g. (Arts Deli from Joes source to Arts Delicatessen from the Department of Health site). This information can be stored in the form of a mapping table, or as a mapping function, if a compact translation can be found to accurately convert data instances from one source into another. Once a mapping construct is created it can be modeled as a new information source. This integration technique allows SIMS to properly integrate data across several sources that contain inconsistent data instances. Presently, mapping constructs are generated manually, but we are developing a semi-automate approach. The figure contains tuples from Joes Restaurant source and the matching tuples from the Health Department: The key idea behind our approach for generating mapping constructs is to compare all of the shared attributes of the sources in order to determine which tuples are matched, ( Name with Name , Address with Address, and Phone with Phone ). Since the data instances in the sources are represented in inconsistent formats they can not be compared using equality, but must be judged according to similarity. To determine the similarity between strings we developed general domain independent transformation rules to recognize transformations like substring, acronym, and abbreviation. For example, Deli is a substring transformation of Delicatessen. A probabilistic similarity measure is calculated for each of the transformations between the strings of the two data instances; and then they each are combined to become the similarity measure of the data instances for that attribute. When comparing the data instance Arts Deli with Arts Delicatessen, the probabilities are calculated for the string transformations of Arts to Arts and Deli to Delicatessen. These probabilities are combined to be the similarity measure for the two instances. After the similarity measures are determined for each of the attributes, Name , Address and Phone , then they are combined to measure the similarity
