Reference-contexts: To see what has changed from version 1.0, see end of this manual. 2 What You Need In order to use psd you need GNU Emacs (either version 18 or 19 will do, I have tried psd with with 18.58 and 19.19), the cmuscheme package for Emacs, a preferably R4RS <ref> [1] </ref> compliant Scheme interpreter and the psd package. GNU Emacs can be found at many major ftp sites, for example nic.funet.fi. These ftp sites also carry Scheme interpreters.
