Abstract: Vi s u a l W h o is a to o l f or v i su a l i z in g a n e le c tr o n i c community. Using data such as mailing list subscriptions, it creates a spring based model of the patterns of af filiation within the community. By varying the groups chosen as anchor points, the user can interactively explore the underlying social and organizational structure. The resulting image of the community can be used as the basis for visualizing other data, such as the patterns of activity found in the record of login and idle times. The goal of Visual Who is to make the social patterns of an electronic community visible. This paper discusses Visual Who within the context both of social interface design and of data visualization.

Reference-contexts: address the problem of showing ongoing activity [12][13][8]<ref> [3] </ref>. Although these installations differ from Visual Who in both purpose and scale, their f indings are quite relevant. In particular, they found that people made quite extensive use of these systems to get a sense of who was around. Bly et al [3] record that participants in the Media Spaces project, who had full access to a wide range Visualizing associations When the Visual Who screen first appears, the names of all the people in the community (there are about 700 of them) are in a pile in the center of the screen.

Reference-contexts: In the current implementation, the af filiations are derived from the mailing-list file and data about the logins and idle times comes from the utmp file 3 2.

Here, however, we are concerned with conveying the social patterns of a community. that are most similar to its profile stream out first. With a single anchor, eventually nearly all the names would end up at this location. In 2) a second anchor is added.

Visual Who uses motion to draw the viewers attention to data that is af fected by a change in the anchor arrangement. While in motion, the moving names form a coherent group, though they may settle in widely scattered areas.

Reference-contexts: This is replaced using the equation for damped harmonic motion <ref> [22] </ref> and the final equation is: The motion is now much faster. It is also smoother, since we have lost the harmonic oscillations that were present in the numerical version; while this would not be desirable in a naturalistic simulation, it is beneficial in this visualization.
