Title: Modeling with Triangular B-Splines  
Author: Gunther Greiner and Hans-Peter Seidel

Abstract: This paper discusses applications of triangular B-splines in solid modeling. The new scheme is well-suited for modeling applications since it allows the construction of smooth surfaces with lowest degree possible. Furthermore, it is possible to represent any piecewise polynomial surface as a linear combination of triangular B-splines. Thus triangular B-splines provide a unified data format for fairly arbitrary surface types. Finally, triangular B-splines are ideally suited for blending applications.
