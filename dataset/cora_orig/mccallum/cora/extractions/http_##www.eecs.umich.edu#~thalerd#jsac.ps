Abstract: Recent multicast routing protocol proposals such as PIM and CBT have been based on the notion of group-shared trees. Since construction of a minimal-cost tree spanning all members of a group is difficult, they rely on center-based trees, and distribute packets from all sources over a single shortest-path tree rooted at some center. PIM and CBT provisionally use administrative selection or simple heuristics for locating the center of a group, but do not preclude the use of other methods that provide an ordered list of centers. Other previously proposed heuristics typically require knowledge of the complete network topology, a requirement which is not always practical for a distributed problem such as Internet routing. In this paper we investigate the problem of finding a good center in distributed fashion, study various heuristics for automating center selection, and examine their applicability to real-world networks. We also propose several new algorithms which we feel to be more practical than existing methods. We present simulation results on hierarchical and non-hierarchical networks showing that of the methods potentially feasible in the Internet Multicast Backbone, ours offer the best results in terms of cost and delay, and incur low overhead.

Reference-contexts: Ideally, a group-shared tree would use a minimal spanning tree to minimize total bandwidth usage, at the expense of end-to-end delay. Finding this tree for some subset of nodes in a graph is known as the Minimal Steiner Tree problem, and is known to be NP-complete <ref> [2] </ref>. Previously proposed heuristics, surveyed in [3], typically require knowledge of the complete network topology, which is impractical for the Internet. A simpler approach to constructing a group-shared tree, proposed by Wall [4], is to use a center-specific tree.

Reference-contexts: Finding this tree for some subset of nodes in a graph is known as the Minimal Steiner Tree problem, and is known to be NP-complete [2]. Previously proposed heuristics, surveyed in <ref> [3] </ref>, typically require knowledge of the complete network topology, which is impractical for the Internet. A simpler approach to constructing a group-shared tree, proposed by Wall [4], is to use a center-specific tree. In this approach, a single node is chosen near the center of the group. <p> If the root is moved to a group member, the bound becomes three times that of source-specific trees. The advantages of a center-specific tree over a Minimal Steiner Tree thus include bounded delay and simpler implementation. Wei and Estrin <ref> [3] </ref> show that in terms of total bandwidth usage, center-specific trees lie somewhere between the Minimal Steiner Tree and source-specific trees. Recent multicast routing protocol efforts, such as PIM [5] and CBT [6], rely on the notion of center-specific trees. In CBT, group-shared trees have centers called "cores". <p> Note that this approach only gives a single center, rather than a list of possible centers which is required for fault tolerance. Wei and Estrin <ref> [3] </ref> show that the Minimum Shortest Path Tree (MSPT) approach performs almost as well as OCBT, and suggest that it is adequate for use with center-based trees. This approach requires calculating the actual costs for the trees rooted at each group member, and chooses the member with the lowest cost. <p> On the other hand, when a network partition occurs, it is less likely that all centers chosen by MIN-MEMB will be unreachable than those chosen by HILLCLIMB. 3.1.2 Weight Functions Studied Functions proposed by others for minimizing include the actual tree cost <ref> [3] </ref>, the average delay, the maximum delay, and the maximum diameter [4]. Although previous work has only dealt with functions for a single algorithm class, we will generalize the functions to apply to any of the six classes described in Section 3.1.

Reference-contexts: Previously proposed heuristics, surveyed in [3], typically require knowledge of the complete network topology, which is impractical for the Internet. A simpler approach to constructing a group-shared tree, proposed by Wall <ref> [4] </ref>, is to use a center-specific tree. In this approach, a single node is chosen near the center of the group. The group-shared tree then becomes the shortest-path tree rooted at that node. Wall shows that a topologically centered tree gives a delay bound of twice that of source-specific trees. <p> This approach requires calculating the actual costs for the trees rooted at each group member, and chooses the member with the lowest cost. Wall <ref> [4] </ref> shows that such a tree has a delay bound of 3 times that of a source-specific tree for each source (whereas a topologically centered tree has a delay bound of 2 times that of a source-specific tree for each source). <p> We observe that the MSPT approach reduces to OCBT when all nodes are group members. Wall presents the following three center-location algorithms in <ref> [4] </ref>, which operate on all nodes in the network: The Maximum-Centered Tree (MCT) algorithm picks the node with the lowest maximum distance to any group member. The Average-Centered Tree (ACT) algorithm picks the node with the lowest average distance to all group members. <p> hand, when a network partition occurs, it is less likely that all centers chosen by MIN-MEMB will be unreachable than those chosen by HILLCLIMB. 3.1.2 Weight Functions Studied Functions proposed by others for minimizing include the actual tree cost [3], the average delay, the maximum delay, and the maximum diameter <ref> [4] </ref>. Although previous work has only dealt with functions for a single algorithm class, we will generalize the functions to apply to any of the six classes described in Section 3.1. Let S be the node list used by nodes participating in the algorithm.

Reference-contexts: In the Random Source-Specific Tree (RSST) heuristic, the center is chosen randomly among the sources and does not move. Doar and Leslie <ref> [7] </ref> found the ratio of the costs of this approach to the optimal Minimal Steiner Tree cost to be typically between 1 and 2 in random graphs of average node degree 3 to 6. <p> c (k) = fl (n k) + (1 fl)k where n is the number of nodes in the network, k is the current number of group members, and fl is a parameter in the range 0 &lt; fl &lt; 1 representing the fraction of nodes which are members at equilibrium <ref> [7, 13] </ref>. Thus, P c (k) &gt; 1 2 when k &lt; fln, P c (k) = 1 2 when k = fln, and P c (k) &lt; 1 2 when k &gt; fln.

Reference-contexts: The Diameter-Centered Tree (DCT) algorithm finds the node which is the midpoint of the lowest maximum diameter, defined as the sum of the distances to the two furthest away nodes. The tournament-based Center-Location Protocol (TOURNEY), proposed by Shukla, Boyer, and Klinker <ref> [8, 9] </ref>, runs a tournament between nodes to determine a center. Sources are initially paired with group members in decreasing order of distance, and remaining nodes are paired randomly with byes inserted appropriately.

Reference-contexts: Other off-tree nodes may not have the necessary information to do this calculation. To calculate the actual cost of a tree for an arbitrary center, we must know the complete network topology and the list of group members. While link-state routing protocols such as OSPF <ref> [10] </ref> maintain topological information for a local domain, complete global network knowledge is not available. Any algorithm which requires complete knowledge is not useful across the MBone, as we require. Algorithms which compute actual tree costs may thus not be practical.

Reference-contexts: Graphs are then generated until one is found which has a single connected component. 4.2 Generating Hierarchical Random Graphs To address scalability issues in the MBone, Thyagarajan and Deering <ref> [12] </ref> have recently proposed using a hierarchy. <p> We assume a two-level hierarchical network composed of a collection of interconnected non-hierarchical regions, as in the HDVMRP proposal <ref> [12] </ref> for the MBone. Nodes inside regions maintain complete routing tables for the region, but know nothing about the structure of other regions. Each inter-region gateway is preconfigured with a metric for a default route it advertises within a region.

Reference-contexts: For this simulation, we see that after about 40 events, 90% of the membership had changed, and tree cost had likewise degraded about 90% of the way towards a randomly-centered tree. Almeroth and Ammar <ref> [14] </ref> describe one study of observed group dynamics on the MBone. For example, a Space Shuttle broadcast over an 11-day period saw 5055 member connections of average duration 300 minutes, giving an average group size of 96 and an average event rate of 0.64 events/minute.
