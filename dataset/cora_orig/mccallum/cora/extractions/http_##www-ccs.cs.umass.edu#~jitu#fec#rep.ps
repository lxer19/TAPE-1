Title: Design and Simulation of a Zero Redundancy Forward Error Correction Technique for Packetized Audio Transmission
Author: Kiran Toutireddy Jitendra Padhye 
Date: December 30, 1995  
Abstract: Forward error correction (FEC) techniques are used to compensate for anticipated transmission errors in a network. When Packetized audio data is sent over a network channel, several different voice reconstruction techniques can be used to compensate for lost and delayed packets. Some of these make use of FEC principles while others do not. Most of the FEC techniques described in the literature are based on transmission of redundant information. Whenever a packet is lost or delayed, an approximate reconstruction of the data contained in that packet can be obtained by using some of the redundant data. In this paper we propose an FEC based reconstruction technique that does not transmit redundant information. Instead, we rely on the limited sensitivity of human ear to low frequency noise and very small periods of silence in an audio stream.

Reference-contexts: If the receiving workstation is heavily loaded, additional packet loss may result. Some of the long term solutions to the problem of packet loss include reservation of bandwidth and admission control and moving towards an integrated service management architecture <ref> [BRAD94] </ref>. In the short term, however, voice reconstruction techniques must be developed and deployed at 1 the receiver sites to cope with the packet loss and delays. Some of the current audio applications do not employ any forward error correction (FEC)techniques and simply replace lost packets with silence [HARD95].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As applications like interactive conferencing over Internet become widespread, the quality of audio transmission becomes more and more important. It has been suggested in <ref> [HARD95] </ref> that quality of audio is one of the important issues in multimedia conferencing environments. Lost and delayed packets can result in degradation of audio quality unless error correction measures are taken. Packet loss has been identified as a major source of problem for audio quality over the MBONE [SASS94]. <p> In the short term, however, voice reconstruction techniques must be developed and deployed at 1 the receiver sites to cope with the packet loss and delays. Some of the current audio applications do not employ any forward error correction (FEC)techniques and simply replace lost packets with silence <ref> [HARD95] </ref>. This results in a clipped audio stream. Others [HARD95] transmit redundant information in each packet. This information can be used at the receiver end to compensate for the effects of lost or delayed packets. <p> Some of the current audio applications do not employ any forward error correction (FEC)techniques and simply replace lost packets with silence <ref> [HARD95] </ref>. This results in a clipped audio stream. Others [HARD95] transmit redundant information in each packet. This information can be used at the receiver end to compensate for the effects of lost or delayed packets. However, transmission of redundant information is an overhead and either the user or the network service provider must pay for it. <p> Some of the data packets may arrive late, and some may not arrive at all. The size of packet and a good estimation of the end-to-end delay are essential to determine the required buffer sizes. It is estimated in <ref> [HARD95] </ref> that the receiver should maintain a buffer at least as large as three packets to smooth over variations in the end-to-end delays. In real time audio transmission, end-to-end delay is a critical factor and should be kept bellow 600ms [HARD95] in the absence of echos. <p> It is estimated in <ref> [HARD95] </ref> that the receiver should maintain a buffer at least as large as three packets to smooth over variations in the end-to-end delays. In real time audio transmission, end-to-end delay is a critical factor and should be kept bellow 600ms [HARD95] in the absence of echos. This may prevent the use of retransmission based techniques, such as those described in [LAMP93] to make up for lost packets. <p> The aim of the process is to construct a replacement packet for the one lost or delayed during transmission. The constructed packet should be such that it makes the loss as imperceptible to the human ear as possible. Voice reconstruction techniques can be categorized into two categories <ref> [HARD95] </ref>: 2 * Receiver-only techniques These techniques do not involve the sender in the reconstruction process in any manner. These techniques are robust in the sense that they can work with any sender. <p> Current audio tools over the Internet, such as VAT and NEVOT [SCHU92] take advantage of the variable packet length feature offered by the IP protocol, but they replace lost or delayed packets with silence. 3 Some of the research done for the MICE project <ref> [HARD95] </ref> indicates that for light and medium load over the MBONE, the losses are non-consecutive in nature. As the load become higher, more consecutive packets are lost. A characterization of packet losses over the Internet is presented in [BOLO95]. <p> During their observation period the authors rarely saw more than six consecutive packets being dropped. 2.4 Measurement of audio quality Quality of an audio stream can be measured by either the subjective or the objective tests. It is known that subjective tests provide more reliable and accurate results <ref> [HARD95] </ref>. These tests are usually performed by getting a large number of people to listen to an audio output and measuring the Mean Opinion Scores (MOS). The tests can also be based on comprehension of a passage of text (comprehension measured by response to a series of questions).

Reference-contexts: The duration of the period is equal to the playback time for the packet. Silence substitution is a prefered method for small sized packets (i.e &lt; 16ms) and upto 1% packet loss <ref> [JAYA81] </ref>. The method is very simple to implement. White Noise Substitution: It has been shown that substituting white noise instead of silence for periods of interrupted speech results in better subjective performance and improvements in intelligibility.

Reference-contexts: In real time audio transmission, end-to-end delay is a critical factor and should be kept bellow 600ms [HARD95] in the absence of echos. This may prevent the use of retransmission based techniques, such as those described in <ref> [LAMP93] </ref> to make up for lost packets. Thus other voice-reconstruction techniques must be used to compensate for, or minimize the effects of, packet loss and delays incurred during transmission. 2.2 Voice reconstruction Voice reconstruction techniques are essentially repair mechanisms for packet losses.

Reference-contexts: Lost and delayed packets can result in degradation of audio quality unless error correction measures are taken. Packet loss has been identified as a major source of problem for audio quality over the MBONE <ref> [SASS94] </ref>. Packet loss can occur due to several reasons. Due to congestion in the network, some of the packets may get dropped at intermediate routers. Also, the packet can get delayed due to queuing at one or more intermediate routers.

Reference-contexts: The service model is inherently unsuitable for transmission of audio (or any multimedia) data in real time, as guarantees regarding throughput and delay variance can not be given. Current audio tools over the Internet, such as VAT and NEVOT <ref> [SCHU92] </ref> take advantage of the variable packet length feature offered by the IP protocol, but they replace lost or delayed packets with silence. 3 Some of the research done for the MICE project [HARD95] indicates that for light and medium load over the MBONE, the losses are non-consecutive in nature.
