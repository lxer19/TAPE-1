Reference-contexts: A. Gilbert's Prefix-Synchronized Codes As mentioned earlier, for p = 1, PPS codes are nothing but the prefix-synchronized codes introduced by Gilbert in 1960 <ref> [4] </ref>. We shall refer to this special class of PPS codes as Gilbert's prefix-synchronized codes or GPS codes. Thus, a GPS code is developed from a single marker M of length k.

Reference-contexts: We investigate some of the properties of R (p; k; L), I (R; D) and D (p; R) in the next section. III. Analysis Before beginning an analysis of the size and performance of PPS codes, it is necessary to introduce the concept of correlation between two binary strings <ref> [7] </ref>, [8], [9]. The correlation between two binary sequences A and B, denoted by A ffi B, is a binary sequence of the same length as A. <p> DRAFT September 10, 1998 15 The work of Gilbert, and subsequently, that of Guibas and Odlyzko <ref> [7] </ref> contained methods for evaluating g M (k + L) using generating functions.

Analysis Before beginning an analysis of the size and performance of PPS codes, it is necessary to introduce the concept of correlation between two binary strings [7], <ref> [8] </ref>, [9]. The correlation between two binary sequences A and B, denoted by A ffi B, is a binary sequence of the same length as A. <p> B. PPS Codes with Period 2 Following the method of analysis of Guibas and Odlyzko <ref> [8] </ref>, we derive a generating function for the number of sequences that can be included in each constituent codebook of a (2; k; L) PPS code with markers M 1 and M 2 . <p> and simplifying, we eventually get zOE AA (z)F AB (z) + zOE AB (z)F BB (z) = z 1k OE AB (z) + F B (z) (15) Solving (14) and (15) for F AB (z), we get F AB (z) = z (OE AA (z) OE AB (z)) Now, in <ref> [8] </ref>, it is shown that F B (z) = (z 2)D (z) + R (z) where D (z) and R (z) are as defined in the statement of the theorem. Plugging this is in the above expression for F AB (z), we get the desired result.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, jf (z) g (z)j &lt; jg (z)j on the circle jzj = 1:5, and so by Rouche's theorem <ref> [10] </ref>, f (z) and g (z) have the same number of zeros in jzj &lt; 1:5. <p> Since all the poles of G M (z) lie in jzj ae k &lt; 2 (Lemma 1), an application of Cauchy's integral formula <ref> [10] </ref> shows that v n = 2j jzj=2 where j = p 1.

Reference-contexts: Hence, ae k &lt; 2, completing the proof of the lemma. It can, in fact, be shown that for k 2, z k z k1 : : : 1 has k 1 zeros in jzj &lt; 1, but the proof is more involved (see <ref> [11] </ref>, for example), and we do not need this fact to prove Theorem 1. <p> R (1; k; L) vs. L for k = 2, 3 and 4. The dashed lines are the asymptotes | log 2 ae 2 = 0:6942, log 2 ae 3 = 0:8792 and log 2 ae 4 = 0:9468. In <ref> [11] </ref>, it is shown that ae k increases with k, and that 2 (1 2 k ) &lt; ae k &lt; 2, from which it follows that lim k!1 ae k = 2.

Reference-contexts: This is simply an effect of the floor function used in the definition of b R (M; L). As an aside, the result of Theorem 1 can also be derived from the perspective of symbolic dynamics <ref> [12] </ref>.
