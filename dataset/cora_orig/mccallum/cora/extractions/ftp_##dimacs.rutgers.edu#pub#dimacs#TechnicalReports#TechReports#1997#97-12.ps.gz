Reference-contexts: Finding the optimal broadcast tree in general graphs is NP-hard. But efficient approximation algorithm exists for the single source broadcast problem which sends a piece of information to every nodes in the network. See Ravi [10]. Various works have been done on more practical broadcast models, see <ref> [1] </ref> [2] [5] We consider the problem that for a random graph G n;p what is the threshold for p such that whp 1 a piece of information can be broadcasted in the graph in exactly dlog 2 ne many steps.

Reference-contexts: broadcast tree rooted on v. (ii) If p = fl (1 + *) ln n=n, then whp 8 v 2 V , there is an optimal broadcast tree rooted on v. 4.2.1 Analysis of Stage 1 The analysis of this stage relies on the following result of Erdos and Renyi <ref> [6] </ref>. Theorem 5 Let G n;n;p be a random bipartite graph with edge probability p. If p (1 + ffi) ln n=n where ffi is any positive constant, then whp a G n;n;p has a perfect matching.

Reference-contexts: The best upperbound to date is due to Frieze, Molloy <ref> [8] </ref> who show that, if p 18 ln n=n then whp there exists a rooted broadcating tree on every node. <p> Then g has a matching of size n 1 if and only if 8U V 1 ; jN (U )j jU j 1: This is stated as an exercise in Bondy and Murty [4]. 4 The Upper Bound The best upperbound to date is due to Frieze and Molloy <ref> [8] </ref>. They show that when p &gt; 18 ln n=n, whp there exists a rooted broadcast tree in G n;p on every node of the graph such that the broadcast time is dlog 2 ne. <p> The general case can easily be proved with a small modification of our proof. In <ref> [8] </ref> Frieze and Molloy show a tight upperbound up to a constant factor, but their method does not seem possible to find the exact threshold due to the perfect matching bottleneck.

Reference-contexts: The broadcast problem is to find the tree and the minimum broadcast time. Finding the optimal broadcast tree in general graphs is NP-hard. But efficient approximation algorithm exists for the single source broadcast problem which sends a piece of information to every nodes in the network. See Ravi <ref> [10] </ref>.
