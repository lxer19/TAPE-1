Reference-contexts: We will propose aspects of a rudimentary theory of obstacle avoidance and use it to quantify some of the requirements placed upon autonomous systems that are derived from the need to ensure safety. It is one of three related papers <ref> [4] </ref>, [5] in these proceedings. 2 Guaranteed Safety Any vehicle which attempts to navigate autonomously in the presence of unknown obstacles must exhibit performance that satisfies a basic set of requirements.
