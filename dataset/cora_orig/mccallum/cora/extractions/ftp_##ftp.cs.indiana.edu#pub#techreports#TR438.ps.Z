Reference-contexts: The simplest case of coupled oscillation is a single driving (input) oscillator uni-directionally coupled to a driven (output) oscillator. Geometrically, the combined motion of the two oscillators in phase-space can be described as the trajectory followed on the surface of a torus <ref> (Abraham and Shaw, 1992) </ref> (see Figure 3.3). In the example shown, the torus represents the Cartesian product of two circles C 1 and C 2 . The set of all points on the surface of the torus represents all possible states of the system.

Reference-contexts: A y-intercept greater than zero implies that there is a minimum subjective duration, a concept initially proposed and supported by (Efron, 1973), and later contested by <ref> (Allan, 1979) </ref>. <p> (1) there is enormous variability in the reported exponents; (2) there is low correlation between exponents reported in ratio-setting experiments and those reported in the estimation experiments; and (3) often the reported exponent is close to 1:0 and thus the data would be equally well fit with a linear function <ref> (Allan, 1979) </ref>. The main direct support for a linear law comes from discrimination data (Creelman, 1962; Kinchla, 1972).

Reference-contexts: Very recently, Nakajima et al. (1992) and ten Hoopen et al. (1993), in claiming to have found a "new" time-illusion, reported similar anchor effects for very brief time-intervals (&lt; 200 ms) using the method of comparison (see <ref> (Allan and Gibbon, 1994) </ref> for a discussion challenging the "newness" of this reported time illusion). In an attempt to formalize the notions of short and long, (Fraisse, 1963) suggested a qualitative distinction among three time perception zones: short, long, and indifferent.

Reference-contexts: The mode-locking behavior of coupled oscillators is often highly structured. One way to examine this structure is to construct what is called an Arnold map <ref> (Arnold, 1983) </ref>. The Arnold map shows specifically how mode-locking behavior varies as a function of the coupling strength and the bare winding number 0 .

Reference-contexts: That is, with regard to many AI approaches to rhythm perception (or more generally to many AI approaches to music perception or speech recognition), I have addressed what might commonly be considered the "non-AI" part of the problem <ref> (Brooks, 1991) </ref>, since such approaches assume that durations are obtained by an unspecified pre-processor (Port et al., 1995). However, from this thesis, the intricate nature of human time perception and its consequent importance to understanding human rhythm perception should be clear.

Reference-contexts: Jones and Boltz (1989) (a kindred spirit of the Entrainment Model proposed in this thesis). 2.6.1 Clock-Counter Models By far, most models of human time perception are based on a modular information-processing approach, in which there is a central timer (or clock), perceptual store, a reference memory, and a comparator <ref> (Church and Broadbent, 1990) </ref>. Such clock-counter models (not to be confused with the clock model proposed for rhythm perception by Povel and Essens (1985)) propose that time is measured using a central timer (the clock) which accumulates (or counts) duration in a perceptual store.

Thus, for a constant mean rate , JNDs are proportional to T , in agreement with Weber's law.

Reference-contexts: is the relationship between isolated-interval sensitivity and tempo sensitivity? Second, what is the effect of increasing the number of isochronous intervals on tempo sensitivity? And finally, what influence is there of musical training on tempo sensitivity? We will examine the data from this series of experiments and a followup study <ref> (Drake and Botte, 1994) </ref> in detail, as these data, which are the most comprehensive tempo-discrimination data for isochronous sequences to date, form a basis for evaluating the predictions of the Entrainment Model developed in Chapter 4. standard isochronous sequence followed by a comparison sequence that is either faster or slower than <p> Second, in studies further investigating the influence of the number of isochronous intervals on tempo sensitivity <ref> (Drake and Botte, 1994) </ref>, it was reported that optimal sequence duration, determined by the maximum number of intervals which lower the relative JND multiplied by the base IOI, is constant at about 1.0 second for IOIs less than about 300 ms, but shifts abruptly to about 2.5 seconds for IOIs greater <p> lower the relative JND multiplied by the base IOI (which I termed the optimal sequence duration in Chapter 2) is constant at about 1.0 seconds for IOIs shorter than about 300 ms, but The Entrainment Model 89 shifts abruptly to about 2.5 seconds for IOIs longer than about 300 ms <ref> (Drake and Botte, 1994) </ref>, providing some additional evidence which suggests that time intervals shorter than 300 are processed differently than those longer than 300 ms. Method The stimulus set for Simulation 1 consisted of isochronous sequences with IOIs of 100, 300, 500, 700, 900, 1100, 1300, and 1500 ms.

Reference-contexts: Related to the central tendency hypothesis, <ref> (Fraisse, 1948) </ref> hypothesized that in time perception, small differences in duration are minimized (assimilated) and large differences in duration are maximized (exaggerated). Such perceptual anchor effects have been reported by a number of researchers (Fraisse, 1948; Goldstone et al., 1957; Goldstone et al., 1959; Turchioe, 1948; Woodrow, 1951).

Reference-contexts: Many studies that have attempted to establish indifference intervals, have reported substantially varying results, with the reported indifference interval ranging from about 0:3 to 5:0 seconds <ref> (Fraisse, 1963) </ref>!. One explanation for the substantial variability observed in indifference interval estimates is due to Hollingworth (1910). <p> In an attempt to formalize the notions of short and long, <ref> (Fraisse, 1963) </ref> suggested a qualitative distinction among three time perception zones: short, long, and indifferent. According to his classification short intervals are less than 0:5 seconds, having the qualitative defining property that the beginning and ending sounds are what is perceived, rather than the time interval between them.

Reference-contexts: than approximately 500 ms are overestimated (exhibit positive constant error), and intervals longer than approximately 1000 ms are under-estimated (exhibit Time Psychophysics: Theory and Data 38 and Botte (1994) negative constant error), with the indifference interval (exhibiting zero constant error) falling somewhere in the range of 500 to 1000 ms <ref> (Fraisse, 1982) </ref>. The main point to be gained from this research is that over- and underestimation does occur relative to some intermediate range of durations; it is not the precise location for the cutoff values for over- and underestimation that matters.

Reference-contexts: ratio T T is not constant, but instead varies as a function of T : T = k T Using the method of reproduction, Getty found that data from two well-trained listeners for intervals between 50 and 2000 ms were in agreement with a different generalized version of Weber's law <ref> (Getty, 1975) </ref>: T = (k 2 T 2 + b 2 ) 2 : (8) With this rule, Getty hypothesized that time sensitivity was determined by two factors: the base interval (T ) and the intrinsic timing variability (b 2 ) of a reproduction task.

Reference-contexts: In a system of coupled oscillators, the oscillators may interact with only their immediate neighbors or with all others; coupling may be unidirectional or bidirectional; and interactions may occur only at discrete points in time (pulse-coupling) or be continuous <ref> (Glass and Mackey, 1988) </ref>. The simplest case of coupled oscillation is a single driving (input) oscillator uni-directionally coupled to a driven (output) oscillator.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the overall shape of the relative JND curve for isolated intervals is U-shaped, although there is considerable debate about whether or not relative JND increases for IOIs longer than about 1000 ms <ref> (see Halpern and Darwin, 1982) </ref>. U-shaped relative JNDs have also been reported for studies investigating the discrimination of a target interval embedded within an isochronous context.

Reference-contexts: For the no-noise condition, the adaptive oscillator locked onto a 400-ms beat period for 80% of the tested patterns, and for all but three of those patterns (Patterns 12, 33, and 34) beats coincided with natural accents in the patterns <ref> (cf., Handel 1989) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Inputs on [0; 1] represent event onsets with variable intensity values. This assumption is consistent with the view that rhythmic organization is primarily determined by the temporal pattern of event-onsets <ref> (Handel, 1993) </ref>. Thus, rhythmic patterns are represented as patterns (streams) of pulses. Figure 3.7A shows the input representation for a four-tone isochronous pattern with a 300 ms IOI.

Reference-contexts: The Contrast Model is essentially one application of dynamic-attending theory <ref> (Jones, 1976) </ref> to time perception. Recall that as part of her entrainment hypothesis, Jones (1976) supposed that rhythmic patterns such as music and speech potentially entrain a hierarchically nested set of attentional periodicities, forming an attentional rhythm. <p> Furthermore, by developing a computational model that is inspired by both single-neuron models (Torras, 1985) and psychology theory <ref> (Jones, 1976) </ref>, continued research is informed by both neuroscience and psychology, and thus will improve our understanding of how the macro-level phenomenon of the perception of rhythm might emerge through complex micro-level interactions in the nervous system.

Reference-contexts: Thus, Schulze's embedded-interval data provides some support for the constant JND claim of Kristofferson and colleagues <ref> (Kristofferson, 1980) </ref>. And Schulze and Kristofferson argue that one reason for the reported departures from Weber's law may be due to their extensive training of the listeners. Differences supposedly due to "training effects" are difficult to evaluate, especially in retrospect.

Reference-contexts: The one-interval patterns permit a direct comparison with the isolated-interval data. Discrimination thresholds were determined using the method of comparison and an adaptive-tracking procedure <ref> (Levitt, 1971) </ref>. Each experimental trial consisted of a fixed standard sequence followed by a Time Psychophysics: Theory and Data 34 comparison sequence, illustrated in Figure 2.6. The listener's task was to determine which sequence was faster. <p> To test this possibility while maintaining the same experimental paradigm used by Drake and Botte (1993), discrimination thresholds were obtained for each interval condition and for each investigated tempo condition using an adaptive-tracking procedure <ref> (Levitt, 1971) </ref>. Each threshold measurement was based on 100 simulated trials (one block). At the start of each block, the tempo difference between the standard and comparison sequences was set to 20%.

Reference-contexts: Tempo Discrimination Tempo discrimination is yet another type of time judgment task. Similar to embedded-interval discrimination, Weber's law seems to apply only under certain conditions. One important issue concerns the relationship between isolated-interval discrimination and tempo discrimination. A somewhat surprising fact is that up until a seminal report by <ref> (Michon, 1964) </ref>, apparently no studies made a direct comparison between isolated-interval discrimination and tempo discrimination.

Reference-contexts: The perceived relation among speech sounds should remain the same whether the speech is loud or soft. Power functions applied to metathetic continua have been somewhat less successful (e.g., for pitch, a power function only adequately describes an intermediate range of the audible sound frequencies <ref> (Moore, 1989) </ref>). 2.2.2 Weber's Law An important issue in psychophysics is the relationship between the just-noticeable difference (JND) in sensation () and the absolute magnitude of the stimulus (), where JND is the stimulus difference, along the tested dimension, yielding 70%-correct performance of subjects detecting that difference. <p> It seems relatively straightforward to assume that the time perception of filled-intervals is a prothetic continuum. The duration of a tone can be thought of as having a physical magnitude since there is a correlation between the physical energy of a tone and its perceived duration <ref> (Moore, 1989) </ref>. Moreover, the perception of tone duration is additive since concatenating two short tones of the same frequency produces a single longer tone.

Reference-contexts: smallest change in sound intensity that a listener is able to reliably detect) (Watson, 1973; Stevens, 1975). 2.2.1 The Power Law For prothetic continua, the psychophysical law governing the relationship between stimulus magnitude and psychological magnitude is generally accepted to be a power law (although there is still considerable debate) <ref> (Stevens, 1975) </ref>; that is, psychological magnitude grows as a power function of the stimulus magnitude : = k x : (1) In the formula, the value of the constant k depends on the units of measurement and that of the exponent x differs from one sensory continuum to another. <p> The value of the exponent can be thought of as characterizing a particular sensory continuum. Figure 2.1 shows the power-law relationship for loudness (x = 0:67), brightness (x = 0:33), and electric shock (x = 3:5) <ref> (Stevens, 1975) </ref>. For loudness and brightness, psychological magnitude grows less and less rapidly with increasing stimulus intensity. In contrast, the sensation of electric shock grows more and more rapidly as the electric current is increased.
