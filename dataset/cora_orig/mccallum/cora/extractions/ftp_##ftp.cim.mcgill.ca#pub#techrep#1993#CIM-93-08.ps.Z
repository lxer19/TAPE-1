Reference-contexts: To obtain optimal solutions, what is required is a process that seeks a best covering but that can compromise locally for global benefit. It will be shown later that this can be achieved with the use of a relaxation labelling algorithm <ref> [ 20 ] </ref> . However, because there are many ways of combining adjacent regions, some means are required to reduce the search space involved. 1.3 Contribution A curvature scale space was developed to reduce the dimension of the search space by organizing data in a precisely structured fashion. <p> Once the scale space representation is built, optimizing the covering of the surface so that the resulting boundaries are consistent with the detected cues becomes possible. We show that this optimization problem maps naturally into a relaxation labelling framework <ref> [ 20 ] </ref> . A label is assigned to each surface patch in the scale space representation and constraints are defined by the detected edges. These constraints will define which regions merge as the labels are allowed to change. 1.4 Paper Summary This paper is organized as follows. <p> We use the term resolution to underline the fact that at convergence the process has resolved the region and edge-based representations into a single consistent interpretation of an object or scene. Continuous relaxation labelling, as defined by Hummel and Zucker in 1983 <ref> [ 20 ] </ref> applies directly to this problem, as it is a global optimization process based on local interactions. 18 3.

Reference-contexts: The process in one dimension is first considered and is then extended to two dimensions. 2.1 Scale Space in 1-D In 1-D, scale spaces are comprised of a waveform undergoing progressive deformation. Through these deformation steps, the components of interest in the waveform are made explicit. Kimia <ref> [ 21 ] </ref> showed that any type of time dependent deformation of a parametrized curve C 0 (s) can be expressed by ffiC ffit = fi ((s))) ! C (s; 0) = C 0 (s); where fi (:) is a function controlling the diffusion process, ! N is the normal to

Reference-contexts: By definition, any feature corresponding to a part boundary cannot be contained within any element of the resulting scale space. Scale is defined by a process of diffusion that progressively smoothes the surface S, yet preserves the positions of putative boundary features. Therefore, unlike a Gaussian scale space <ref> [ 32, 22 ] </ref> , we avoid the problem of coarse-to-fine tracking, which is necessary to recover the true position of features. Accurate location of position is essential for further modelling.

Scale is defined by a process of diffusion that progressively smoothes the surface S, yet preserves the positions of putative boundary features. Therefore, unlike a Gaussian scale space <ref> [ 32, 22 ] </ref> , we avoid the problem of coarse-to-fine tracking, which is necessary to recover the true position of features. Accurate location of position is essential for further modelling. <p> The overall effect is to bring out mostly convex shapes. Notice how the separation between each convex shape really stands out. Figure 2.2b shows the curvature scale space image, which for this diffusion process also corresponds directly to what Witkin called an interval tree <ref> [ 32 ] </ref> . At each scale, the signal could be segmented along the vertical lines. It can be noticed that Gaussian diffusion as in Figure 2.3a, is not tuned to convex shapes and indiscriminately smoothes the regions and their boundaries. <p> These contours are curved (features change position) and a coarse-to-fine tracking algorithm is necessary to properly locate features at coarse scales and obtain an interval tree as in Figure 2.2b.
