Abstract: In this paper we show that small random force perturbations do not alter the mechanical properties of the elbow joint in posture by comparing the pulse responses evoked by a pulse force with or without superimposed random force perturbations. Random force perturbations have little effect on the pulse response, and the pulse response is consistent with the mechanical properties obtained through random perturbations. The biceps and triceps EMGs are smaller with random perturbations than without them, which may be due to pre-synaptic inhibition.

These results imply that position perturbations alter the joint mechanical properties. <p> The small EMG peaks produced in the combination trials may be due to pre-synaptic inhibition resulting from activity in spindle and other afferents. As the pulse strength increases the relative effect becomes less as shown in Figure 2, which is consistent with the previous findings in <ref> [2] </ref>. Kearney and Stein [2,3] recently showed that the passive joint movement alters stretch reflex gain significantly, which implies the change of the joint mechanical properties. The difference between our findings and theirs is clearly due to the different type of the perturbations.

These results imply that position perturbations alter the joint mechanical properties. In this paper we reexamine this issue by using small force perturbations rather than position perturbations because we think that the large forces from position perturbations change the joint mechanical properties.

Reference-contexts: Methods Two normal male subjects were studied in detail. Subjects sat in a chair, held their forearm vertically and rested their elbow on a piece of clay. The airjet perturbation device reported in <ref> [4] </ref> was strapped to the subject's wrist. In addition a nozzle is added to the airjet system to provide a pulse force. Both the airjet and pulse forces are measured by the same force sensor.
