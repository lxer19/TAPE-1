Abstract: The ability to distribute signals to all parts of a circuit with precisely controlled and known delays is essential in large, high-speed digital systems. We present a technique by which a signal driver can adjust the arrival time of the signal at the end of the wire using a pair of matched variable delay lines. We show how this idea can be implemented requiring no extra wiring, and how it can be extended to distribute signals skew-free to receivers along the signal run as well as the receiving end. We demonstrate how this scheme can be implemented as part of the pad and scan This report describes research done at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Reference-contexts: The received signal is simply the content on the wire with the signal being sent subtracted. The hybrid coil in a telephone, in use for decades, is an example of a circuit using this idea to effect full-duplex transmission. [Dally] <ref> [1] </ref> uses a similar approach for full-duplex communication between nodes in a multiprocessor. 8 Distributed Receivers Once we can control the arrival time of the signal at the end point, it is also possible to allow receivers distributed along the line to receive the signal at the same time.

Reference-contexts: The clock driver is placed in the control loop of the PLL, adjusting the output of the amplified clock signal to be in phase with the reference clock input received. Examples of off-the-shelf chips designed to implement this idea include the Gazelle GA1110E and the Motorola MC88915. [Johnson] <ref> [3] </ref> uses PLL's to compensate for skew introduced by process variations in chips participating on a tri-state bus.

Reference-contexts: In this case we measure and compensate for the propagation delay. It is also possible to measure the line impedance <ref> [4] </ref> or frequency response characteristics, for example. Also interesting to note is that we can view this setup simply as an example of full-duplex communication on a single wire.

Reference-contexts: In synchronous transmission, data traveling on wires with delays longer than a clock period may cause metastability if arriving data violates the setup 2 time required before the qualifying edge of the clock. [Rettberg] <ref> [6] </ref> describes one solution to this problem. A remedy is to precisely control the amount of time spent in transmission so that the clock always samples the data during the middle of a data cell.

Reference-contexts: Variable delays can also be implemented by interpolating the delay between gates. A bipolar implementation of this idea is described in [Walker] <ref> [8] </ref>. In the one-wire approach where the reflected wave is measured, we need either two kinds of logic gates with different trip points or a differential amplifier for subtracting the sender's signal.
