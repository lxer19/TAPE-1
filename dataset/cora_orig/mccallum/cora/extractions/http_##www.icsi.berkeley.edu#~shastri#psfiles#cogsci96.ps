Title: A Connectionist Treatment of Negation and Inconsistency

Abstract: A connectionist model capable of encoding positive as well as negated knowledge and using such knowledge during rapid reasoning is described. The model explains how an agent can hold inconsistent beliefs in its long-term memory without being aware that its beliefs are inconsistent, but detect a contradiction whenever inconsistent beliefs that are within a certain inferential distance of each other become co-active during an episode of reasoning. Thus the model is not logically omniscient, but detects contradictions whenever it tries to use inconsistent knowledge. The model also explains how limited attentional focus or action under time pressure can lead an agent to produce an erroneous response. A biologically significant feature of the model is that it uses only local inhibition to encode negated knowledge. The model encodes and propagates dynamic bindings using temporal synchrony.

Reference-contexts: A detailed review of synchronous cortical activity appears in (Singer, 1993). The idea that synchronous :love (Tom,Susan). activity can bind features during visual processing had been suggested by von der Malsburg (1986) <ref> (also see Bienenstock & Geman, 1995) </ref>, but SHRUTI is perhaps the first model to demonstrate how synchronous activation can be harnessed to solve complex problems in the representation and processing of conceptual knowledge.

Reference-contexts: This work extends our work on SHRUTI, a connectionist model of reflexive reasoning (Ajjanagadde & Shastri, 1991; Shastri & Ajjanagadde, 1993; Mani & Shastri 1993) and is partly influenced by <ref> (Cottrell, 1985) </ref>. A detailed description of the extended model appears in (Shastri & Grannes, 1995). System Overview This section presents a brief summary of the system. Due to limited space we will not describe the encoding of multiple instantiations, type hierarchy, and context-sensitive rules.

Reference-contexts: Eventually the chain of inference terminates when activation falls below a threshold. The solution to the problem of negation and inconsistency proposed above is simpler than the one suggested in <ref> (Cottrell, 1993) </ref>. The latter suggests duplicating the entire predicate bank for each predicate. In this scheme, each predicate P would have two separate banks of role, enabler and collector nodes: one for positive knowledge about P (+P), and another for negative knowledge about P (-P).

Reference-contexts: All rules and facts that involve a predicate converge on its cluster, and all rules and facts involving a predicate can be accessed by fanning out from the predicate's cluster. This representation of a predicate is closely related to the notion of convergence zones <ref> (Damasio, 1989) </ref>. Let us examine the semantic import of the enabler and collector nodes. Assume that the roles of a predicate P are dynamically bound to some fillers thereby representing a dynamic instance of P (we will see how, shortly).

Reference-contexts: Introduction The ability to perform inferences in order to establish referential and causal coherence and generate expectations plays a crucial role in understanding language <ref> (e.g., McKoon & Rat-cliff, 1981) </ref>. Given that we can understand language at the rate of several hundred words per minute, it is also apparent that we can perform the requisite inferences rapidly as though they were a reflex response of our cognitive apparatus.

Reference-contexts: Given that we can understand language at the rate of several hundred words per minute, it is also apparent that we can perform the requisite inferences rapidly as though they were a reflex response of our cognitive apparatus. In view of this, we have described such reasoning as reflexive <ref> (Shastri, 1991) </ref>. 1 Certain types of negated knowledge also plays a role in such reasoning.

Reference-contexts: Some models deal partially with negation 1 A formal characterization of reflexive reasoning appears in <ref> (Shastri, 1993) </ref>. 2 We are using the notation of first-order logic for convenience. This does not mean that we view deduction to be the sole basis of reflexive reasoning. All variables are assumed to be universally quantified. by adopting the closed world assumption in AI. <p> The system's ability to evaluate incoming information enables it to detect inconsistencies between incoming information and prior knowledge. This evaluation process is fast and automatic but the scope of inconsistency detection is bounded by the constraint on the maximum depth of reflexive reasoning <ref> (Shastri & Ajjanagadde, 1993) </ref>. Observe that here we are referring to a reflexive process of evaluation and not a deliberate search for inconsistencies. <p> Thus a t -and node behaves like a temporal and node. On becoming active, it produces an output pulse similar to the input pulse. A threshold, n (default value 1), associated with a node indicates that the node will fire upon receiving n or more inputs simultaneously <ref> (see Shastri & Ajjanagadde, 1993) </ref>. Encoding Dynamic Bindings: Dynamic bindings are represented by the synchronous firing of appropriate role and filler nodes. With reference to Figure 1, the rhythmic pattern of activity shown in Figure 2 represents the dynamic bindings (lover=Mary,lovee=Tom) (i.e., the dynamic fact love (Mary,Tom)). <p> Observe that Mary and lover are firing in synchrony and Tom and lovee are firing in synchrony. The absolute phase of firing of nodes is not significant. Also since e:love is firing, the system is essentially asking whether it believes that Mary loves Tom. As discussed at length in <ref> (Shastri & Ajjanagadde, 1993) </ref>, there exists substantial neurophysiological evidence to suggest that the propagation of synchronous activity is neurally plausible. A detailed review of synchronous cortical activity appears in (Singer, 1993).
