Title: Formality and Informality in Requirements Engineering  
Author: Joseph A. Goguen 
Address: San Diego, La Jolla CA 92093-0114  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science and Engineering University of California at  
Abstract: This paper is an overview of a new approach to requirements; the exposition takes formality and informality as its theme. The approach considers that requirements are information and that information is social. Ethnomethodology and semiotics are used to explore the nature of information and requirements. Some limits of formalization, and the importance of tacit knowledge and evolution motivate new methods for acquiring and tracing requirements.

Reference-contexts: To understand information, we must broaden our perspective beyond specific technical factors. In contrast to statistical theories of information following Shannon [20], and representational theories of information like the situation theory of Barwise and Perry <ref> [1] </ref>, we suggest a social theory of information [6]. No theory of the kind we need can be "objective" or "realist," in the sense of assuming a pre-given distinction between subject and object, or an objectively given real world.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the relations among requirements and other objects also depend on context and result from negotiation. Hence, a trace system should allow great flexibility in defining and updating artifacts and relations. toor uses the powerful modules of parameterized programming <ref> [3] </ref> to represent context in various ways, and to allow users to define and update relations; this supports any category systems that users may wish to employ. Modularity can also improve quality and reduce cost through reuse. 2. Requirements are an inextricable part of the development process.

Reference-contexts: We can distinguish information that can be understood in a wide variety of contexts from information that is so thoroughly situated that it cannot be understood except in relation to certain very particular contexts. We call these types of information dry and wet, respectively <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. There is really a continuum of "humidity" for information, i.e., there is "damp" information, of which cookery recipes seem a typical example. <p> This will likely overthrow aspects of prior analyses. Discourse analysis of stories can be used to explore the value system of an organization, and discourse analysis of explanations can provide a kind of situated task analysis <ref> [4] </ref>. Conversation and interaction analyses can help overcome limitations of other methods. Interaction analysis reveals details of non-verbal interaction in real work environments, but the effort required to produce video transcripts suggests that it should be used very selectively. Ethnography should be used continually to provide context.

Reference-contexts: This paper is an overview, drawn mainly from [6, 7] and [8]. 2 Understanding Requirements Requirements are properties that a system should have in order to succeed in the environment where it will be used. This definition (from <ref> [5] </ref>) refers to a system's context of use, and thus to the social as well as the technical. Much of the information needed for requirements is embedded in the social worlds of users and managers. It is informal and depends on context for its interpretation. <p> However, purely technical approaches cannot take adequate account of the informal social, political and cultural factors that are so often responsible for failures of real systems. Both the formal, context insensitive, and the informal, socially situated aspects of systems are crucial to the success of requirements engineering; <ref> [5] </ref> suggests that the task of requirements engineering is to reconcile them; see also the discussion in [21]. 2.1 Tacit Knowledge It can be hard to get adequate data on which to base requirements. Experience shows that simply asking managers what they want often works poorly. <p> Ethnography can help by providing an initial understanding of the group being studied. Eth-nomethodological analysis is labour intensive; projects may involve hundreds of hours for recording, transcribing and analysing data. Ethnomethodology can be hard to understand; relatively comprehensible expositions of some important points appear in [12], [22], and <ref> [5] </ref>. Conversation analysis studies details of overlap, response, interruption, repair, etc. in ordinary conversation [19], while interaction analysis uses video data. <p> The following qualities of situatedness (from <ref> [5] </ref>, partly following Suchman [22]) may help clarify this: 1. Emergent: Events cannot be understood at the level of the individual, that is, in terms of individual (cognitive) psychology, because they are jointly constructed by members of some group through their on-going interactions. 2. <p> We can distinguish information that can be understood in a wide variety of contexts from information that is so thoroughly situated that it cannot be understood except in relation to certain very particular contexts. We call these types of information dry and wet, respectively <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. There is really a continuum of "humidity" for information, i.e., there is "damp" information, of which cookery recipes seem a typical example. <p> Interaction analysis reveals details of non-verbal interaction in real work environments, but the effort required to produce video transcripts suggests that it should be used very selectively. Ethnography should be used continually to provide context. Thus, I suggest a "zooming" method for requirements elicitation <ref> [5] </ref>, whereby more expensive but detailed methods are used selectively for problems found by other methods to be especially important.

Reference-contexts: The social situatedness of information means that to some degree, it is irreducibly informal. However, there are some advantages to informality and situatedness for requirements engineering, including greater flexibility and efficiency.

Although this can be useful, the introspection of an expert in a different field, such as computer science, may not reflect the experience of the intended users. <p> Thus, protocols are an unnatural discourse form, based on an incorrect cognitivist model that ignores social context. This unnaturalness can be shown by specific linguistic features <ref> [7] </ref>. None of these methods can elicit tacit knowledge.

This definition (from [5]) refers to a system's context of use, and thus to the social as well as the technical. <p> Unfortunately, theorem provers for first order logic can be difficult to work with. Formal notations can also capture higher levels of meaning, e.g., they can express security requirements, but such notations are even more difficult. The orderliness of social life (due to accountability) and the Henley Regatta example in <ref> [8] </ref> suggest that social interaction might be formalizable; but there are limits to how successful any such formalization can be. In particular, it will not be easy to formalize domains where there are many ad hoc special cases, or where much of the knowledge is tacit. <p> This implies that without human intervention, a formalization may well be inadequate for its intended application; this is illustrated by common incidents like computer systems sending checks or bills for a zero amount. For a discussion of limits and problems with formal methods, see <ref> [8] </ref>. 5.2 Advantages of Informality Advocates of formal methods often say that formalization eliminates the vagueness and ambiguity of natural language. But our discussions above show this is not really so.

Reference-contexts: These qualities give rise to basic limitations of information, and hence of requirements. 2.5 Sociology of Science There have been exciting new developments in the sociology of science. One important voice is Bruno La-tour <ref> [11] </ref>. Latour calls a representation that can be interpreted in essentially the same way in a variety of contexts an immutable mobile. <p> Latour claims that these three qualities, immutability, mobility, and concentration, are characteristic of scientific information. Formalization tends to increase these qualities. Indeed, they may be considered as criteria for the success of formalization. As Latour <ref> [11] </ref> points out, the construction of immutable mobiles can be a way to achieve control. For example, if an analyst compresses large amounts of information into simple graphical representations, then anyone who wishes to disagree must mobilize the resources to re-represent comparable amounts of information. <p> Information, however dry, must still be interpreted in some local context. Dry information is distinguished by the possibility of its being interpreted in what counts as the same way for practical purposes in a useful variety of contexts. Latour <ref> [11] </ref> discusses the example of cartographic maps: given the proper instruments and proper conditions (e.g., good weather), such maps can be used anywhere in the world; but each such use is still a local interpretation.

Reference-contexts: Context includes being embedded in the world, which can make information directly available so that detailed models are unnecessary. Another way to say this is that information arises co-dependently between humans and contexts, as noted long ago by Peirce <ref> [16] </ref>. Rising to a still higher level, we might say that beauty, or perhaps better authenticity, comes from relating properly to context. This includes choosing the proper level of formality. Inappropriate formality can be alienating, while properly contextualized formality can be inspiring. Acknowledgements I thank Prof.

Reference-contexts: Several tools have been developed to help organize requirements. However, most are based on naive models that take little account of social context (see <ref> [17] </ref> for a review). <p> Traceability is crucial for survival in such a dynamic environment, but is seldom straightforward, as it involves not just objects and relations to be traced, but also their context, from the motivation for the trace to the total system development con text. The toor system <ref> [17] </ref> was designed for defin-ing, instantiating, updating and tracing hypermedia artefacts and relations in several modes, through an intuitive template-driven graphical interface. toor's object orientation supports user-definable classes and inheritance for requirements objects and relations, and provides a database with automated checks and annotations.

Reference-contexts: This is not because managers are incompetent; in fact, they are often real experts at their job. Rather, it is due to what philosophers <ref> [18] </ref> call the problem of tacit knowledge, i.e., the phenomenon that people are able to do things, without being able to say how they do them. Some examples are riding bicycles, speaking languages, negotiating contracts, reconciling personal differences, evaluating employees, and using a word processor.
