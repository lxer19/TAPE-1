Abstract: A black or mirror sphere of surface area A moving at velocity v in a bath of thermal radiation at temperature T will experience a drag force AT 4 v=(c 2 v 2 ) where c is the speed of light and is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. This is a corrected version of a previous TN.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the paper by Hayashida et al. 1994 was brought to my attention. Several cosmic rays with energies over 10 11 times the rest mass of a proton have now been observed. The record <ref> (Bird et al. 1994) </ref> is a cosmic ray, "consistent with a proton," with an energy of 3 fi 10 11 proton masses, i.e., over 50 Joules! These rays seem to have come from outside of our galaxy. Everybody concerned agrees that they are very mysterious.
