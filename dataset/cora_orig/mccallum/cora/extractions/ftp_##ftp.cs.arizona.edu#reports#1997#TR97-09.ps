Title: Right Triangular Irregular Networks  
Author: William Evans David Kirkpatrick Gregg Townsend 
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Arizona  Department of Computer Science University of British Columbia  Department of Computer Science University of Arizona  
Abstract: We describe a hierarchical data structure for representing a digital terrain (height field) which contains approximations of the terrain at different levels of detail. The approximations are based on triangulations of the underlying two-dimensional space using right-angled triangles. The methods we discuss allow the approximation to precisely represent the surface in certain areas while coarsely approximating the surface in others. Thus, for example, the area close to an observer may be represented with greater detail than areas which lie outside their field of view. We discuss the application of this hierarchical data structure to the problem of interactive terrain visualization. We point out some of the advantages of this method in terms of memory usage and speed.

Such partitions have been studied in relation to crystal lattices <ref> [1] </ref>, image encoding [11], and, in fact, geographic visualization systems [15, 18, 17]. The partitions contained in the hierarchy are defined inductively as follows. The partition composed of two triangles formed by dividing the square from northwest to southeast corner is the coarsest partition in the hierarchy. <p> If extended to cover the plane, such a uniform partition is called a [4:8 2 ] Laves net named by Bell, Diaz, Holroyd, and Jackson <ref> [1] </ref> after F. Laves. The name lists the degree of the vertices of the atomic polygon within the partition, in cyclic order around the polygon. In this case, the right angled vertex has degree 4, and the two other vertices both have degree 8.

Reference-contexts: The price of such small storage is the rigidity and uniformity of the sampling pattern. A TIN hierarchy allows varying levels of detail within an approximation at the expense of more storage. There are several hierarchies based on irregular triangulations <ref> [2, 4] </ref>. One may roughly divide them into those that preserve the boundaries of coarse triangulations in going to finer triangulations, and those that do not.

Reference-contexts: The price of such small storage is the rigidity and uniformity of the sampling pattern. A TIN hierarchy allows varying levels of detail within an approximation at the expense of more storage. There are several hierarchies based on irregular triangulations <ref> [2, 4] </ref>. One may roughly divide them into those that preserve the boundaries of coarse triangulations in going to finer triangulations, and those that do not. <p> The precise function used to calculate the badness of a triangle is not our main focus. One may choose an inverse distance weighting of the triangle's error, the area that the projection of the triangle occupies on the display screen, or other measures. (See <ref> [4] </ref> and [15] for examples.) One obvious common criteria is that triangles at the finest level of detail should not be refined. As long as the number of triangles in the surface is below the allowed threshold, this procedure continues to split triangles in order of badness.

Reference-contexts: When the threshold is reached, the triangles in the approximation are sent to the rendering software to be drawn. 10 7 Experimental results on hierarchical representations An interactive visualization system incorporating the ideas presented in this paper may be downloaded from the first author's web site <ref> [5] </ref>. All experimental results presented in this session are from this implementation. The system on which we ran these experiments is an SGI Indigo2 with a High Impact graphics board, and 128 megabytes of main memory, running IRIX 6.2.

Reference-contexts: The heart of the algorithm is a loop which updates the surface representation in response to movements of the eye position. The algorithm constructs the approximation in a manner similar to the general greedy TIN construction method of Fowler and Little <ref> [7] </ref>. Their method incrementally adds the input point that is most poorly approximated to the approximation and then retriangulates the x,y projection of the points. In our case, we do not have the flexibility of adding an arbitrary point to the current approximation.

Reference-contexts: The storage disadvantage becomes worse if one requires adjacency information for the triangulation; if, for example, one needs the ability to traverse the surface approximation from triangle to adjacent triangle. The factor of three difference in storage requirements has led to an unfavorable view of TINs. Kumler <ref> [13] </ref> argues that to achieve a certain degree of accuracy in the representation of a height field, DEMs require less storage space than TINs. However, he then states, "I did not expect these results.

Reference-contexts: The problem of having, for example, 0 and 00 both representing the same integer can easily be solved by prepending a 1 to the node label. The addressing scheme obtained in this way corresponds to the typical implicit array representation of a binary heap <ref> [22] </ref>. By using the array representation, we eliminate child pointer storage. Since we require the hierarchy to contain the full level of detail, the height value of every x,y point must be available.
