Abstract: Today's geo-information systems are closed systems mainly supporting geographic tasks in 2D space. In new spatial application areas such as environmental research, geology, city planning or telecommunications, however, a database and processing support for 3D/4D objects is required. Thus the development of object-oriented 3D/4D modelling and data handling components for geo-information systems is a new challenge. We first report on our experience with GeoStore, an information system already in use for the management of geologically defined geometries. We then follow the way from GeoStore to the design of GeoToolKit, an object-oriented geo-database kernel system for the development of 3D/4D applications. GeoToolKit supports object-oriented modelling of geo-applications, spatial data maintenance within an ODBMS including spatial indexing and the 3D-visualization of spatial objects and query results. Conversely, we also present the reconstruction of a geological application on top of GeoToolKit. Finally we give an outlook on our GeoToolKit research within an open component based environment of geo-information services.

Reference-contexts: The model is further tested by backward restoration and balancing. The final model is used for the specification of boundary conditions for 3D transport models, or for the production and consistent updates of geological maps. As we outlined in <ref> [BBC94a] </ref> the starting point for the interactive geological 3D/4D-modelling within the CRC was the digitalization of geological sections gained from open-cast workings in the Lower Rhine Basin (Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: To provide an efficient retrieval a space must have a spatial index (see below). In order to make an arbitrary user-defined index known to GeoToolKit, it must fit the interface defined within the abstract AccessMethod class. GeoToolKit supports two indexing methods: the R-Tree <ref> [Gut84] </ref> for a pure spatial retrieval and the LSD-Tree [HSW89] for a mixed spatial/thematic retrieval.

First geo-database kernel systems like PROBE <ref> [JO88] </ref> or the DASDBS-Geokernel [SW86], [WB92] have already been realized 10 years ago. However, these systems were not widely used in the geoscience community. Our experience shows that the object-oriented modelling approach helped to overcome the gap between computer- and geo- worlds. We intend to make GeoToolKit less programmer-oriented.

Reference-contexts: We began the development of GeoStore 1 with the elaboration of an object data model. The object-modelling technique <ref> [RBP + 91] </ref> provided an appropriate environment for the communication between geo- and computer scientists. Geologists not-experienced in software design quickly adopted this technique and successfully applied it. Figure 2 shows a part of the object model realized in GeoStore. <p> Figure 6 presents their relationships within the data model of GeoToolKit shown in the OMT-like notation <ref> [RBP + 91] </ref>. On the abstract level a spatial object is defined as a point set in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. Diverse geometric operations can be applied to a spatial object. However, they cannot be implemented until a spatial object has a concrete representation.
