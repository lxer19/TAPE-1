Reference-contexts: The value of U act was used to measure the achievable utilization. * The periods of the messages were chosen from three uniform distributions with the fol lowing ranges: small periods: [C; 10C] large periods: <ref> [1; 000C; 10; 000C] </ref> wide range of periods: [C; 10; 000C] * The number of packets per message was chosen from a uniform distribution such that the utilization of each message stream U act;i fell into one of the three following ranges. <p> The period p i of each message was chosen from a uniform distribution in the range [2; p max ]. The number of packets in each instance of M i is the same and was chosen from a uniform distribution in the range <ref> [1; 0:5p i ] </ref>. The periodic message was admitted to the system if, after its addition, the utilization of its input and output links was no more than 1.0. <p> MLF-ED1 and MLF-ED2 is not as great as in Figure 7.9. 7.4 Distribution of Periods In our simulations, we drew the periods of the messages from a uniform distribution in the range [2; p max ] and drew the number of packets per period from a uniform distribution with range <ref> [1; 0:5p i ] </ref>. The maximum value we allowed for p max was 7, so the maximum schedule length we simulated was 420 (the LCM of the integers 2 through 7).

Reference-contexts: The input and output links for each periodic message were chosen at random from the N input and N output links with each input and output link equally likely to be chosen. The period p i of each message was chosen from a uniform distribution in the range <ref> [2; p max ] </ref>. The number of packets in each instance of M i is the same and was chosen from a uniform distribution in the range [1; 0:5p i ]. <p> We show here the success rates of our algorithms in finding conflict-free schedules for different schedule lengths. The switch size in this experiment was 4 fi 4, and the average link utilization U was 95%. The periods of the messages were taken from the range <ref> [2; 7] </ref>. Thus, the largest schedule length generated was 420 which is the LCM of the integers from 2 to 7. Figure 7.2 shows that between the two row-by-row algorithms, MLF-RR performs slightly better than EDF-RR. <p> Once again, we see a dramatic improvement for both the MLF-ED1 and MLF-ED2 algorithms, although the difference between MLF-ED1 and MLF-ED2 is not as great as in Figure 7.9. 7.4 Distribution of Periods In our simulations, we drew the periods of the messages from a uniform distribution in the range <ref> [2; p max ] </ref> and drew the number of packets per period from a uniform distribution with range [1; 0:5p i ].

Reference-contexts: Thus the goal of the network is to provide fair and efficient service by using a combination of admission control, traffic shaping, link scheduling, and buffer management. In <ref> [8] </ref>, Clark et al. discussed the FIFO+ algorithm for scheduling soft-real-time VBR traffic and compared its performance to a guaranteed bandwidth algorithm (WRR). The FIFO+ algorithm is actually a global deadline-based scheduler which takes into account the completion times of packets at previous hops.

Reference-contexts: Scheduling Hard-Real-Time Periodic Messages The first problem we addressed is that of scheduling hard-real-time periodic messages in a multihop packet-switched network with finite buffer space at each hop. For this problem, we developed the budgeted-weighted-round-robin (BWRR) algorithm. The BWRR algorithm is a modification of the weighted-round-robin (WRR) <ref> [29, 10, 23] </ref> algorithm which cycles through the message streams transmitting a limited number of packets from each stream, thus guaranteeing each stream a minimum fraction of the transmission bandwidth. <p> We classify them into two groups: priority-based and rate-based. The best known algorithms are listed in Table 3.1. The primary advantage of the priority-based algorithms is that they provide a great deal of flexibility in providing different delay bounds for 19 Priority-Based Fair Queueing (FQ) <ref> [10] </ref> Virtual Clock (VC) [46] Delay Earliest-Due-Date (D-EDD) [14] Jitter Earliest-Due-Date (J-EDD) [42] Minimum-Laxity-First (MLF) [28] Rate-Controlled Static-Priority queuing (RCSP) [44] Rate-Based Framed-Round-Robin (FRR) [35, 22] Stop and Go (S&G) [15] Timed-Token (TT) [18] Table 3.1: Real-time scheduling algorithms. diverse messages. <p> The FRR and S&G algorithms can achieve the same end-to-end delay and buffer space requirement as the BWRR algorithm, but they require global clock synchronization to do so. Fair Queueing The goal of the Fair Queueing (FQ) algorithm <ref> [10] </ref> is to emulate bit-by-bit round robin service among the message streams. <p> set of permutation matrices which add up to the original traffic matrix T and that the schedule given by the permutation matrices schedules all traffic with the common period of the traffic. 29 Chapter 4 Scheduling Hard-Real-Time Periodic Messages In this chapter, we present a modification of the weighted-round-robin (WRR) <ref> [29, 10, 23] </ref> algorithm, called the budgeted-weighted-round-robin (BWRR) algorithm, for scheduling real-time messages in a multihop packet-switched network. The WRR algorithm cycles through the message streams transmitting a limited number of packets from each stream, thus guaranteeing each stream a minimum fraction of the transmission bandwidth. <p> Section 4.3 discusses the network utilization achieved by BWRR. We conclude in Section 4.4 with a summary of our results. 4.1 Weighted-Round-Robin Scheduling Before we discuss the BWRR algorithm, we first introduce the WRR algorithm and its properties. The WRR algorithm is closely related to FQ <ref> [10] </ref>, but our description of the algorithm is slightly different and the presentation in [10] does not analyze the properties of the algorithm for the periodic message model which we use throughout this chapter. <p> The WRR algorithm is closely related to FQ <ref> [10] </ref>, but our description of the algorithm is slightly different and the presentation in [10] does not analyze the properties of the algorithm for the periodic message model which we use throughout this chapter. <p> The value of U act was used to measure the achievable utilization. * The periods of the messages were chosen from three uniform distributions with the fol lowing ranges: small periods: [C; 10C] large periods: <ref> [1; 000C; 10; 000C] </ref> wide range of periods: [C; 10; 000C] * The number of packets per message was chosen from a uniform distribution such that the utilization of each message stream U act;i fell into one of the three following ranges. <p> The value of U act was used to measure the achievable utilization. * The periods of the messages were chosen from three uniform distributions with the fol lowing ranges: small periods: [C; 10C] large periods: [1; 000C; 10; 000C] wide range of periods: <ref> [C; 10; 000C] </ref> * The number of packets per message was chosen from a uniform distribution such that the utilization of each message stream U act;i fell into one of the three following ranges. <p> It is likely that playback traffic will have different delay requirements; however, we leave this issue to future work. In our study, we simulated the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) algorithm as well as three algorithms designed for real-time constant-bit-rate (CBR) traffic: the weighted-round-robin (WRR) <ref> [10, 29] </ref> algorithm, the budgeted-weighted-round-robin (BWRR) algorithm which we described in Chapter 4, and the timed-token (TT) algorithm [18].

Priority-based algorithms require the scheduler to maintain a sorted priority queue, which for most priority assignments is expensive and may not be feasible in a high-speed switch. <p> AT&T has implemented the FRR algorithm in its experimental ATM switch [35]. A disadvantage of the FRR algorithm is that jitter increases at each hop and is therefore proportional to the number of hops in the path of the message stream. Stop and Go The S&G algorithm <ref> [15] </ref> is similar to the FRR algorithm in that it segments time into frames and assigns weights to message streams. However, the S&G algorithm limits jitter by defining relationships between incoming and outgoing frames. <p> Theorem 4.3 The maximum buffer space required for a message stream M i at hop L when scheduled according to the WRR algorithm is (1 + dC (L 1)=p i e)c i packets. The Hierarchical Round Robin (HRR) [22] and Stop-and-Go (S&G) <ref> [15] </ref> algorithms are frame-based schedulers which eliminate some of the problems of the WRR algorithm. According to both these methods, time is explicitly fragmented into fixed size frames of length F = C. Within a frame, each message stream is allocated a fixed number of slots which cannot be exceeded. <p> p i nU act;i [0.001,0.01] [0.05,0.10] [0.001,0.05] [1,000C,10,000C] 0.916 0.994 0.981 Table 4.3: U act with C = 1; 000. p i nU act;i [0.001,0.01] [0.05,0.10] [0.001,0.05] [1,000C,10,000C] 0.991 0.999 0.997 Table 4.4: U act with C = 10; 000. just as the frame-based algorithms can include multiple frame lengths <ref> [15, 22] </ref>. What we have shown in this section is that high average utilization of the network is achieved over message streams with periods that differ by four or five orders of magnitude.

Timed-Token The timed-token (TT) algorithm <ref> [18] </ref> was originally introduced as the medium access control mechanism for the FDDI local area network. However, the TT algorithm can also be used to provide a type of round robin service to message streams in an packet switch. <p> In our study, we simulated the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) algorithm as well as three algorithms designed for real-time constant-bit-rate (CBR) traffic: the weighted-round-robin (WRR) [10, 29] algorithm, the budgeted-weighted-round-robin (BWRR) algorithm which we described in Chapter 4, and the timed-token (TT) algorithm <ref> [18] </ref>. It is well known that the earliest-deadline-first (EDF) algorithm is an optimal real-time scheduling algorithm in the sense that if a schedule that meets all deadlines exists (a feasible schedule), the EDF algorithm yields such a schedule [27] 1 .

Reference-contexts: When a packet is scheduled before its deadline at one hop it is delayed at the next hop. The authors found that the FIFO+ algorithm greatly outperformed the WRR algorithm in terms of worst-case completion time. In the area of buffer management, Hamdaoui and Ramanathan <ref> [19] </ref> presented a method for scheduling soft-real-time traffic with (m; k) loss requirements where the network is allowed to drop at most m packets in any sequence of k packets.

Reference-contexts: The time-slot assignment (TSA) problem in an SS/TDMA system is to find a conflict-free assignment of packets to slots that minimizes schedule length, thus maximizing the switch utilization. Another objective is to minimize the number of switching modes used, thus simplifying the switch. In <ref> [20] </ref>, Inukai showed that, for an N fi N switch, when the periods of all messages are equal and the utilization of each input and output link is equal to 1.0, a conflict-free feasible schedule can be found by using the system of distinct representatives (SDR) algorithm which we now describe. <p> each time slot in the row being scheduled, the packet with the minimum laxity which does not conflict with any packet already scheduled in the slot is scheduled. 72 The second two of our heuristics are based on a combination of the system of distinct representatives (SDR) algorithm discussed in <ref> [20] </ref> with the EDF and MLF algorithms. The SDR algorithm makes use of the information provided by the system traffic matrix. A traffic matrix T is an N fiN matrix.

Reference-contexts: Scheduling Hard-Real-Time Periodic Messages The first problem we addressed is that of scheduling hard-real-time periodic messages in a multihop packet-switched network with finite buffer space at each hop. For this problem, we developed the budgeted-weighted-round-robin (BWRR) algorithm. The BWRR algorithm is a modification of the weighted-round-robin (WRR) <ref> [29, 10, 23] </ref> algorithm which cycles through the message streams transmitting a limited number of packets from each stream, thus guaranteeing each stream a minimum fraction of the transmission bandwidth. <p> The biggest drawback of the FQ algorithm is that the scheduler must keep a sorted priority queue of messages, thus making a high-speed implementation impractical. In Chapter 4, we describe the weighted-round-robin (WRR) scheduling algorithm <ref> [23] </ref> which is similar to the FQ algorithm but has a much simpler implementation. Virtual Clock Just as the FQ algorithm tries to emulate bit-by-bit round robin, the Virtual Clock (VC) algorithm [46] tries to emulate the Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) service discipline. <p> set of permutation matrices which add up to the original traffic matrix T and that the schedule given by the permutation matrices schedules all traffic with the common period of the traffic. 29 Chapter 4 Scheduling Hard-Real-Time Periodic Messages In this chapter, we present a modification of the weighted-round-robin (WRR) <ref> [29, 10, 23] </ref> algorithm, called the budgeted-weighted-round-robin (BWRR) algorithm, for scheduling real-time messages in a multihop packet-switched network. The WRR algorithm cycles through the message streams transmitting a limited number of packets from each stream, thus guaranteeing each stream a minimum fraction of the transmission bandwidth. <p> Hence, according to the WRR algorithm, the actual length of each cycle is at most equal to C but can be less than C. A description of a WRR hardware scheduler can be found in <ref> [23] </ref>. By an appropriate assignment of the weights, the WRR algorithm can guarantee that each M i is given at least c i slots within every period p i . <p> The scheduler sets the variable to w i when it begins to transmit packets from M i and continues to transmit from M i as long as the content of the variable is greater than zero <ref> [23] </ref>. To implement the BWRR algorithm, we also use such a variable, called bgt i for each message stream M i which gives the budget of packets that M i may transmit. As packets from M i are transmitted, bgt i is decremented.

Reference-contexts: The Periodic Model The periodic message model was originally described in the context of processor scheduling <ref> [27] </ref>. As stated in Chapter 2, a periodic message M i is characterized by the tuple (c i ; p i ; d i ; j i ; k i ) or 18 more simply (c i ; p i ). <p> The VC algorithm has the same drawback as the FQ algorithm: it requires that the scheduler maintain a sorted priority queue. Delay Earliest-Due-Date The Delay Earliest-Due-Date (D-EDD) algorithm [14] is based on the Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF) algorithm <ref> [27] </ref> in which packets are assigned deadlines and the scheduler transmits packets in order of their deadlines. Liu and Layland proved that on a single link the EDF algorithm achieves 100% link utilization when used to transmit periodic messages whose relative deadlines are equal to their respective periods. <p> The jobs are assigned time slots in the schedule and the schedule is repeated over and over. Sporadic and aperiodic 25 messages can be admitted to such a network by scheduling them in the slots not used by the periodic messages. In the priority-driven approach to scheduling real-time jobs <ref> [27, 25] </ref>, the periodic jobs are assigned a priority and the scheduler always executes the highest priority job. <p> In the priority-driven approach to scheduling real-time jobs [27, 25], the periodic jobs are assigned a priority and the scheduler always executes the highest priority job. The priorities may be dynamic, as in the case of the Earliest-Deadline-First EDF algorithm <ref> [27] </ref>, or static as in the cases of the Rate Monotonic (RM) [27] and Deadline Monotonic (DM) [25] algorithms. In the simplest case, sporadic and aperiodic messages may be handled in priority-driven systems by scheduling them in the background, i.e., scheduling them only when there are no periodic messages ready. <p> The priorities may be dynamic, as in the case of the Earliest-Deadline-First EDF algorithm <ref> [27] </ref>, or static as in the cases of the Rate Monotonic (RM) [27] and Deadline Monotonic (DM) [25] algorithms. In the simplest case, sporadic and aperiodic messages may be handled in priority-driven systems by scheduling them in the background, i.e., scheduling them only when there are no periodic messages ready. <p> It is well known that the earliest-deadline-first (EDF) algorithm is an optimal real-time scheduling algorithm in the sense that if a schedule that meets all deadlines exists (a feasible schedule), the EDF algorithm yields such a schedule <ref> [27] </ref> 1 . When all relative deadlines are equal, the FCFS algorithm is equivalent 1 The EDF algorithm is optimal when preemption is allowed at any time.

Reference-contexts: Scheduling Hard-Real-Time Periodic Messages The first problem we addressed is that of scheduling hard-real-time periodic messages in a multihop packet-switched network with finite buffer space at each hop. For this problem, we developed the budgeted-weighted-round-robin (BWRR) algorithm. The BWRR algorithm is a modification of the weighted-round-robin (WRR) <ref> [29, 10, 23] </ref> algorithm which cycles through the message streams transmitting a limited number of packets from each stream, thus guaranteeing each stream a minimum fraction of the transmission bandwidth. <p> set of permutation matrices which add up to the original traffic matrix T and that the schedule given by the permutation matrices schedules all traffic with the common period of the traffic. 29 Chapter 4 Scheduling Hard-Real-Time Periodic Messages In this chapter, we present a modification of the weighted-round-robin (WRR) <ref> [29, 10, 23] </ref> algorithm, called the budgeted-weighted-round-robin (BWRR) algorithm, for scheduling real-time messages in a multihop packet-switched network. The WRR algorithm cycles through the message streams transmitting a limited number of packets from each stream, thus guaranteeing each stream a minimum fraction of the transmission bandwidth. <p> It is likely that playback traffic will have different delay requirements; however, we leave this issue to future work. In our study, we simulated the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) algorithm as well as three algorithms designed for real-time constant-bit-rate (CBR) traffic: the weighted-round-robin (WRR) <ref> [10, 29] </ref> algorithm, the budgeted-weighted-round-robin (BWRR) algorithm which we described in Chapter 4, and the timed-token (TT) algorithm [18].

Priority-based algorithms require the scheduler to maintain a sorted priority queue, which for most priority assignments is expensive and may not be feasible in a high-speed switch. <p> Thus, although implementing a limited number of priorities in an RCSP network is simpler than implementing a sorted priority queue, the RCSP algorithm is still expensive to implement because of the required regulator. Framed Round Robin The Framed Round Robin (FRR) <ref> [35, 22] </ref> scheduling algorithm explicitly fragments time into frames of length F where F is the number of packets that can be transmitted in one frame. A FRR scheduler keeps track of two queues of message stream descriptors: the current queue and the next queue. <p> Thus the 23 weight of the stream determines the minimum bandwidth allocated to the stream. The main advantage of a FRR scheduler is its simple implementation. AT&T has implemented the FRR algorithm in its experimental ATM switch <ref> [35] </ref>. A disadvantage of the FRR algorithm is that jitter increases at each hop and is therefore proportional to the number of hops in the path of the message stream.

Reference-contexts: We say that two message instances 33 have zero jitter if their interarrival time is equal to the period of the message stream. Jitter, then, is the absolute value of the difference of the interarrival times and the period. From the analysis of work-conserving schedulers in <ref> [45] </ref>, we can conclude that Theorem 4.2 The worst-case jitter for a message transmitted on an L-hop packet-switched network according to the WRR algorithm is p i c i + (L 1)(C 1). <p> A closely related problem with the WRR algorithm is the excessive buffer usage which also grows with the number of hops as is stated by the following theorem <ref> [45] </ref>.
