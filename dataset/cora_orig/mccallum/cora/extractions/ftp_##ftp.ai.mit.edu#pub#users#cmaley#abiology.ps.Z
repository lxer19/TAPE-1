Abstract: Artificial Life spans a continuum from engineering to biology. Biological organisms are inspiring both as existence proofs for the tractability of many engineering problems and as testaments to the innovation and power of evolution as a sort of "blind" engineer. The middle of the continuum is occupied by researchers trying to synthesize life in novel substrates. Far from the nightmares of Frankenstein, theoretical biologists are beginning to open up some of the most intractable problems of biology through the use of new computer modeling techniques. Artificial Biology is this approach of using computer models to simulate biological systems. These simulations allow us to gain experimental control over biological systems that are beyond direct empirical methodologies. The models also allow us to address systems with complexities that would make an analytical model intractable. In this way, Artificial Biology complements the traditional fields of empirical and theoretical biology.

Reference-contexts: Artificial Biology is, in effect, an extension of theoretical biology. Computer simulations provide a new tool for developing biological insight. Configuration models <ref> [4] </ref>, where each individual and the rules for their interactions are explicitly represented in the computer, complement the analytical models of traditional theoretical biology. 3 4.1 Methodology Progress is made in Artificial Biology by examining hypotheses in biology and determining how well they apply to a synthetic system.

Reference-contexts: While the artificial life researcher is forced to make some minimal assumptions to fill in those gaps, field and laboratory biologists can then test those assumptions. In this way, we complete the cycle between theoretical and experimental biology. 4.2 Sexual Selection Collins and Jefferson <ref> [6] </ref> provide a good example of an Artificial Biology model. They chose to examine the dynamics of sexual selection. Sexual selection is one of the five major processes that leads to evolution, along with natural selection, mutation, migration, and genetic drift.

This observation has drawn engineers into an attempt to harness the forces of evolution and thereby sow the seeds of our own designs.

Genetic algorithms simulate three important aspects of evolution in order to solve a problem. First, they include a population of individuals.

Reference-contexts: In fact, 4 sexual selection is thought to be the driving force behind the evolution of the gaudy, but presumably burdensome, peacock's tail. How does the phenomenon of sexual selection evolve in a population? Collins and Jef-ferson began with a two loci, two allele analytical model developed by Kirkpatrick <ref> [12] </ref>. One locus represented a gene for some trait to be expressed in males and the other a gene expressed in females for the preference for that trait in their mates.

Reference-contexts: If we ever could create new forms of life, we would no longer have a sample of one to study. Comparative biology, in a deep sense, could begin.

Tierra is similar to game of "Core Wars" where little assembly language viruses live, replicate, and destroy each other in a section of "core" memory. However, Tierra prevents the self-replicating programs from destroying each other.
