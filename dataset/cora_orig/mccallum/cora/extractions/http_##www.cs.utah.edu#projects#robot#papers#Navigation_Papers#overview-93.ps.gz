Abstract: Navigation in outdoor terrain is difficult due to a lack of easily and uniquely identifiable landmarks. This paper outlines current research on extraction of navigationally salient features from images and maps, feature matching and viewpoint determination, landmark selection, detection and diagnosis of route following errors, perceptual issues related to vision-based navigation, and database and software avail ability.

Reference-contexts: Finally, this correspondence is used to place the viewpoint in the map/model frame of reference. At least in principle, these steps are relatively straightforward when downward looking aerial imagery is matched against a standard "plan view" map.

Matching is essentially 2-D correlation.

Reference-contexts: Our approach to the development of novel methods for vision-based navigation is interdisciplinary, involving computational analysis, computer simulations, and studies of expert map users. Many of the strategies we use to automatically solve localization problems <ref> [ Heinrichs et al., 1992, Thompson et al., 1993 ] </ref> arose out of experiments done with experts solving actual and artificial navigation problems [ Pick et al., 1994 ] .

Reference-contexts: Elsewhere in this proceedings we summarize two such studies [ Pick et al., 1993 ] . One demonstrates that people are poor at estimating distance and slope in environments of the scale and topography typical of outdoor navigation tasks <ref> [ Melendez et al., in prep ] </ref> . Since passive vision systems are also poor at these estimates, the strategies people use to compensate for their perceptual limitations may also be relevant in automated systems. The second study deals with localization using visual angle.

Reference-contexts: At the same time, we can identify specific perceptual skills for which mechanized aids and/or alternative training might significantly improve human performance.

Reference-contexts: Many of the strategies we use to automatically solve localization problems [ Heinrichs et al., 1992, Thompson et al., 1993 ] arose out of experiments done with experts solving actual and artificial navigation problems <ref> [ Pick et al., 1994 ] </ref> . In retrospect, these strategies make excellent computational sense since the experts are highly adapted to dealing with the ambiguity and complexity inherent in these problems. Nevertheless, the strategies were not obvious to us or others until we undertook our studies.

Reference-contexts: We are addressing this problem by creating a qualitative model of error in vision-based navigation and using this model to characterize the sorts of errors that can occur, how they can be detected, and what sort of diagnosis is possible to determine the original source of difficulties <ref> [ Stuck, 1992 ] </ref> . The research suggests a number of techniques that may usefully complement lower-level perceptual servoing. 5 Perceptual Issues.

Reference-contexts: We have previously demonstrated that the accuracy of landmark-based viewpoint determination is quite sensitive to geometric properties of the particular configuration of landmarks used <ref> [ Sutherland, 1992 ] </ref> . Recently, the image understanding community has been paying increased attention to error estimation. Of equal importance are approaches which minimize the amount of error which can occur rather than only providing a posteriori characterizations of the error distribution.

Reference-contexts: Starting from the analysis of uncertainty regions, it is possible to develop simple heuristics for selecting landmarks likely to minimize the size of such regions <ref> [ Suther-land, 1993, Sutherland, 1994 ] </ref> . Note that this is not as easy as it might seem, since the problem must be solved with very minimal knowledge about the true viewing location. Figures 9 and 10 demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.
