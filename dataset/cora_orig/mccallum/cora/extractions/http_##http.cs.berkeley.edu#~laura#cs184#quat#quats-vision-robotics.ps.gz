Abstract: Computer vision and robotics suffer from not having good tools for manipulating three-dimensional objects. Vectors, coordinate geometry, and trigonometry all have deficiencies. Quaternions can be used to solve many of these problems. Many properties of quaternions that are relevant to computer visions and robotics are developed. Examples are given showing how quaternions can be used to simplify derivations in computer vision and robotics.

Reference-contexts: The mathematical object called "quaternion" is such a tool. Quaternions were invented by Hamilton in the early 1840's [1]. They were the result of an attempt by Hamilton to resolve the question: What is the result of dividing one (three-dimensional) vector by another? The story <ref> [3] </ref> goes that Hamilton thought about this question for some time, then while walking across a bridge he saw the answer, and carved in the stone the formula that was the basis for quaternions: i 2 = j 2 = k 2 = ijk = 1 (1) This formula gives the
