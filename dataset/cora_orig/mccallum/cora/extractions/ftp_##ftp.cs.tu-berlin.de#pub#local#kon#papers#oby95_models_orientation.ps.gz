Abstract: Orientation and ocular dominance maps in the primary visual cortex of mammals are among the most thouroughly investigated of the patterns in the cerebral cortex. A considerable amount of work has been dedicated to unraveling both their detailed structure and the neural mechanisms which underlie their formation and development. Many schemes have been proposed, some of which are in competition. Some models focus on development of receptive fields while others focus on the structure of cortical maps, i.e. the arrangement of receptive field properties across the cortex. Each model used different means to determine its success at reproducing experimental map patterns, often relying principally on visual comparison. Experimental data is becoming available which allows a more careful evaluation of models. In this contribution more than ten of the most prominent models of cortical map formation and structure are critically evaluated and compared with the most recent experimental findings from macaque striate cortex. Comparisons are based on properties of the predicted or measured cortical map patterns. We introduce several new measures for comparing experimental and model map data which reveal important differences between models. We expect that the use of these measures will improve current models by helping determine parameters to match model maps to experimental data now becomming available from a variety of species. Our study reveals that (i) despite apparent differences, many models are based on similar principles and consequently make similar predictions, (ii) several models produce orientation map patterns which are not consistent with the experimental data from macaques, regardless of the plausibility of the models' suggested physiological implementations, (iii) no models have yet fully accounted for both the local and the global relationships between orientation and ocular dominance map patterns.

Reference-contexts: For example, some experimenters have claimed that in certain or all layers of cortex more cells are responsive to a few particular orientations than to others <ref> (e.g. Bauer and Dow 1989) </ref>. Other studies, including the optical imaging data from the superficial layers of V1, Fig. 8, do not show any overrepresentation of a particular preferred orientation in the recorded areas (Finlay, Schiller and Volman 1976; Hubel and Wiesel 1968; Poggio, Doty and Talbot 1977).

Reference-contexts: The minor axis is aligned approximately perpendicular to the ocular dominance band borders. Consequently, the map of orientation is stretched along this axis and it is stretched such that its wavelength along this direction nearly matches the period of the ocular dominance pattern <ref> (Obermayer and Blasdel 1993) </ref>. Additionally, ocular dominance and orientation preference slabs are each aligned with an individual common axis, and these axes | defined as the major axes of the corresponding power spectra | are orthogonal ("global orthogonality") (Obermayer 1993). Other correlations become apparent in a contour plot representation. <p> Yet, most studies focused on properties of the experimental patterns which arise from very basic assumptions like broken rotational symmetry which leads to global map anisotropies. Consequently, most of the models were able to account for the observed inter-species variations. As more and better data become available <ref> (e.g. Blasdel, Livingstone and Hubel 1993) </ref>, fewer of the existing models may continue to be useful. Finally, one would like to have relatively simple models which make predictions about several aspects of cortical organization.

Reference-contexts: Most of the data being reviewed here were obtained with optical recordings <ref> (Blasdel and Salama 1986) </ref>, since no other method can currently provide both high-resolution data of large surface areas and fairly unambiguous estimates of orientation preferences and ocular dominance in the same animal. Due to limitations of this method, however, data can only be obtained from the superficial layers. <p> For a quantitative analysis, see (Blasdel, Ober-mayer and Kiorpes 1994; Obermayer and Blasdel 1993). Correlations have also been reported for fractures, which tend either to align with the centers of ocular dominance bands or to run perpendicular to their borders <ref> (Blasdel and Salama 1986) </ref>. Also, regions in the centers of ocular dominance bands tend to be less specifically tuned to their preferred orientation than regions which receive balanced input from both eyes (Blasdel 1992b; Livingstone and Hubel 1984).

Reference-contexts: Diversity is the result of competition, implemented as a selection rule in the self-organizing map (Obermayer, Ritter and Schulten 1990; Obermayer, Blasdel and Schulten 1992), and by a softmax nonlinearity in the elastic net <ref> (Durbin and Mitchison 1990) </ref>. Presenting the inputs in a random order causes a random choice among the possible stationary states and thus leads to global disorder. 3.4 Singularities and Linear Zones Two features are prominent when visually inspecting the orientation map in with a rainbow appearance. <p> These correlations have been demonstrated for the self-organizing map (Obermayer, Blasdel and Schulten 1992; Obermayer, Schulten and Blasdel 1992) and are also present when the elastic-net approach <ref> (Durbin and Mitchison 1990) </ref> is appropriately extended (see appendix 6.4.2). The correlations trivially emerge when patterns with the undesired combinations, e.g. low orientation specificity combined with binocularity, are excluded from the training set. However, they also occur when the training set includes all possible combinations of feature preferences.

Reference-contexts: However, since the model maps are derived through a linear mapping from a conservative vector field (in which vectors are always perpendicular to the field gradient) the model predicts a unique type of link between cortical and orientation preference coordinates <ref> (Erwin, Obermayer and Schulten 1993) </ref>. This relationship restricts the range of patterns the model can produce, as is easily demonstrated visually near singularities, Figure 17. <p> ); q = kuk; where u = f @z ; @r 2 Due to the gradient operation, the orientation vector field is linearly related to a conservative field, and the model wrongly predicts correlations between 33 orientation preferences and cortical locations such that I is fulfilled for every closed path <ref> (Erwin, Obermayer and Schulten 1993) </ref>. Rojer and Schwartz proposed separate models for orientation preference and ocular dominance, and omitted orientation specificity.

Reference-contexts: In some species, such as macaque, the anisotropy in the ocular dominance pattern is strong enough to produce roughly parallel bands of ocular dominance across half of area 17 <ref> (Florence and Kaas 1992) </ref>. In the cat the orientation preference patterns are anisotropic, while the ocular dominance bands are spotty and much less aligned (Andersen, Olavarria and van Sluyters 1988; Diao, et al. 1990).

Reference-contexts: These experiments also revealed a lateral organization characterized by mostly smooth changes in response properties with lateral distance. The results culminated in the proposal of two seemingly incompatible models of cortical organization | an "ice-cube" model <ref> (Hubel and Wiesel 1977) </ref> and a "pinwheel" model (Braitenberg and Braitenberg 1979; Gotz 1987). In recent years, imaging techniques (Blasdel 1992a,b; Blasdel and Salama 1986, Grinvald, et al. 1986, Ts'o, et al. 1990) have been developed which allow an increasingly improved characterization of striate cortex organization. <p> The continuity and diversity principles have been the fundamental principles of almost all descriptive and developmental models of orientation or ocular dominance map patterns. They were already implemented in both Hubel and Wiesel's original ice-cube model <ref> (Hubel and Wiesel 1977) </ref> and in the early pinwheel models (Braitenberg and Braitenberg 1979; Gotz 1987), Figure 5. However, maps from certain models which follow both of these principles may still differ in qualitative ways from experimental data. <p> This is, however, not true for all of the structural models. Braitenberg's original proposal (Brait-enberg 1985; Braitenberg and Braitenberg 1979), for example, included +1 sin-gularities balanced by twice their density of 1=2 singularities, and the original ice-cube model <ref> (Hubel and Wiesel 1977) </ref> did not contain these features at all.

Reference-contexts: Regions of similar eye dominance are segregated in bands which run in parallel for a considerable distance, but sometimes branch and terminate. Surprisingly the orientation preference and ocular dominance patterns are not independent as had once been believed <ref> (Hubel, Wiesel and Stryker 1978) </ref>, but are correlated. For example, Figure 3a shows the Fourier transform of the map of orientation preference with an arrow indicating the direction perpendicular to the ocular dominance bands.

Reference-contexts: It has been suggested that receptive fields be described not only as spatial filters but as spatio-temporal filters (e.g. Adelson and Bergen 1985; Emerson, Bergen and Adelson 1992). Other suggestions aim at the inclusion of non 9 linearities <ref> (Lehky, Sejnowski and Desimone 1992) </ref> in order to account for com-plex cells, cells in higher brain areas, or intra-cortical feedback (Reggia, et al. 1992; Sirosh and Miikkulainen 1994). These more realistic representations, however, have not yet been extensively used in models of cortical map structure and formation.

Reference-contexts: It is, however, instructive to note how the inclusion of realistic receptive field properties impacts on the cortical map patterns. Correlation-based learning models perform well for ocular dominance (Miller, Keller and Stryker 1989). When applied to the formation of orientation maps <ref> (Linsker 1986c, Miller 1992) </ref>, the ON/OFF-competition model under-represents linear zones, and produces maps without a band-pass power spectrum. These points might be related to the low resolution of the maps necessitated by high computational demand. Linsker's model always predicts a link between preferred orientation and direction of its vector gradient. <p> Financial Support to E. E. by the Beckman Institute and to K.

Reference-contexts: The existence of linear zones is related to the power spectrum. Linear zones are abundant only if the power spectrum has a strong bandpass characteristic, because linear zones are characterized by a periodic change of orientation preferences with distance. The ON/OFF-competition model <ref> (Miller 1992, 1994) </ref> and the model of Tanaka (Miyashita and Tanaka 1992), generate maps with a power spectrum with significant energy in low-frequency modes, and lacking a significant bandpass characteristic.

In one high-dimensional model <ref> (Miller 1992, 1994) </ref>, cortical cells develop receptive fields with ON and OFF subfields, based on hypothetical correlations in the firing patterns of ON- and OFF-center geniculate cells. (See appendix 6.3.)

Miller's model for orientation preference <ref> (Miller 1992, 1994) </ref> is formally similar, with the two feature vectors ON and OF F now representing connections to separate populations of ON- and OFF-center cells in the LGN.

Reference-contexts: They were not expected to predict the structure of cortical maps with as much precision. It is, however, instructive to note how the inclusion of realistic receptive field properties impacts on the cortical map patterns. Correlation-based learning models perform well for ocular dominance <ref> (Miller, Keller and Stryker 1989) </ref>. When applied to the formation of orientation maps (Linsker 1986c, Miller 1992), the ON/OFF-competition model under-represents linear zones, and produces maps without a band-pass power spectrum. These points might be related to the low resolution of the maps necessitated by high computational demand. <p> Miller's ocular dominance development model <ref> (Miller, Keller and Stryker 1989) </ref> uses a "high-dimensional" feature vector i (r; x) coding for the strength of connection from each cortical location r to each retinal location x in each of two eyes i 2 f0; 1g.

Reference-contexts: Regions of similar eye dominance are segregated in bands which run in parallel for a considerable distance, but sometimes branch and terminate. Surprisingly the orientation preference and ocular dominance patterns are not independent as had once been believed <ref> (Hubel, Wiesel and Stryker 1978) </ref>, but are correlated. For example, Figure 3a shows the Fourier transform of the map of orientation preference with an arrow indicating the direction perpendicular to the ocular dominance bands.

Reference-contexts: developmental processes and is not simply due to a folding of the cortical surface. 2 Models which introduce periodic boundary conditions as a convenience are not intended to imply that cortical patterns are periodic, and thus do not necessarily violate the principle of global disorder. 12 of randomly oriented vectors <ref> (Swindale 1982, 1992) </ref> with Mexican-hat type ker-nels or in the Fourier domain by multiplying white noise with a bandpass filter (Niebur and Worgotter 1993; Rojer and Schwartz 1990). Continuity and diversity arise by suppressing both high- and low-frequency Fourier modes; global disorder results from applying the filter to white noise. <p> Usually there are many possible stationary states. The overwhelming majority of these tend to lack global order because of degeneracies due to translational symmetry 3 in the underlying pattern-generating equations or due to frustration <ref> (Swindale 1982, 1992) </ref>. Random choice of initial conditions and/or randomly directed movement in the state space, e.g. in response to random inputs (Durbin and Mitchison 1990; Obermayer, Ritter and Schulten 1990; Obermayer, Blasdel and Schulten 1992), effectively cause a random choice of one of these stationary states. <p> Training biases lead to biases in feature preferences (Obermayer, Ritter and Schulten 1992) which may be consistent with experimental findings (Blakemore and van Sluyters 1975; Stryker, et al. 1978). Increased ability to control the distribution of specificities and feature preferences distinguishes iterative spectral models <ref> (Swindale 1982, 1992) </ref>, from similar one-step models (Niebur and Worgotter 1993; Rojer and Schwartz 1990).
