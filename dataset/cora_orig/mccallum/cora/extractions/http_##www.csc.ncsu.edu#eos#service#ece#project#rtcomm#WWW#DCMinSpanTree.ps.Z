Abstract: We formulate the problem of constructing broadcast trees for real-time traffic with delay constraints in networks with asymmetric link loads as a delay-constrained minimum spanning tree (DCMST) problem in directed networks. Then we prove that this problem is NP-complete, and we propose an efficient heuristic to solve the problem based on Prim's algorithm for the unconstrained minimum spanning tree problem. This is the first heuristic designed specifically for solving the DCMST problem. Simulation results under realistic networking conditions show that our heuristic's performance is close to optimal when the link loads are symmetric as well as when asymmetric link loads are used. Delay-constrained minimum Steiner tree heuristics can be used to solve the DCMST problem. Simulation results indicate that the fastest delay-constrained minimum Steiner tree heuristic, DMCT [1], is not as efficient as the heuristic we propose, while the most efficient delay-constrained minimum Steiner tree heuristic, BSMA [2], is much slower than our proposed heuristic and does not construct cheaper delay-constrained broadcast trees.

Reference-contexts: A number of delay-constrained multicast routing algorithms have been proposed during the past few years. A delay-constrained shortest path heuristic was proposed in [12], and several cost-efficient, but quite complex, delay-constrained minimum Steiner tree heuristics were proposed in <ref> [13, 1, 14, 2] </ref>. A thorough evaluation of different multicast routing algorithms, unconstrained and delay-constrained, can be found in [15]. The destination set of the minimum Steiner tree problem may be any subset of the network nodes. <p> The comparison given in [15] shows that BSMA [2] is the most efficient delay-constrained minimum Steiner tree heuristic. The distributed delay-constrained minimum Steiner tree heuristic, DMCT, proposed in <ref> [1] </ref>, is the only fast heuristic capable of generating DCMSTs. DMCT was designed for networks with symmetric link loads (undirected networks). In this paper, we propose an efficient DCMST heuristic for the general case of networks with asymmetric link loads (directed networks). <p> Kompella's DMCT algorithm <ref> [1] </ref> resembles phase 1 of BDB, but its approach to relax the delays is different from BDB's. However, DMCT does not have an equivalent to phase 2 of BDB.

In this paper, we propose an efficient DCMST heuristic for the general case of networks with asymmetric link loads (directed networks). Both our heuristic and DMCT are based on Prim's unconstrained MST algorithm <ref> [17] </ref>. We will show that the heuristic we propose outperforms DMCT, not only in the case of directed networks, but also in the special case of undirected networks. We also compare our heuristic to BSMA. This paper is organized as follows. <p> We formulated the problem as a DCMST problem in directed networks, and then we proved that this problem is NP-complete. We proposed a bounded delay broadcast (BDB) heuristic to solve the DCMST problem. The heuristic consists of two phases. The first phase is based on Prim's algorithm <ref> [17] </ref> and constructs a moderate-cost delay-constrained spanning tree. The second phase reduces the cost of that tree by replacing tree link with cheaper links not in the tree without violating the imposed delay constraint.

Reference-contexts: The positions of the nodes were fixed in a rectangle of size 3000 fl 2400 Km 2 , roughly the area of the USA. A random generator (based on Waxman's generator <ref> [19] </ref> with some modifications) was used to create links interconnecting the nodes. The output of this random generator is always a connected network in which each node's degree is 2. <p> The output of this random generator is always a connected network in which each node's degree is 2. The probability of a link to exist between any two nodes is a function of the distance between these two nodes <ref> [19] </ref>. We adjusted the parameters of the random generator to yield networks with an average node degree of 4. Figure 2 shows an example of a randomly generated 20-node network. The propagation speed through the links was taken to be two thirds the speed of light.

Reference-contexts: The next step is to transform a known NP-complete problem to DCMST-undirected. We will use the Exact Cover by 3-Sets (X3C) problem which has been shown to be NP-complete in <ref> [20] </ref>. It can be stated as follows.
