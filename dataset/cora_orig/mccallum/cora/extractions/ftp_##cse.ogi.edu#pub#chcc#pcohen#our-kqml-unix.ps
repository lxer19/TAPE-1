Abstract: This paper considers the semantics of the agent communication language KQML. By using this language for communication, agents will be able to request and provide services. Indeed, numerous projects have shown how the language can profitably support in-teroperation among distributed agents. However, before becoming a widely-accepted standard, it would be worthwhile to examine the language in detail, especially the semantical issues it raises. This paper identifies numerous difficulties with the language, and an attempt is made to point to their resolution. The paper illustrates the kind of semantics we believe to be necessary to characterize agent communication languages, identifies an important adequacy condition (composi-tionality) and shows how to compose a question from a request and an inform. Finally, the paper discusses possible impacts to be felt on various KQML decisions from the semantical issues raised here. Keywords: Agent Communication Languages, KQML, speech acts

Reference-contexts: We begin by giving an abbreviated description of our analysis of rational action upon which we erect a theory of speech acts. The theory is cast in a modal logic of belief, goal, action, and time. Further details of this logic can be found in <ref> (Cohen & Levesque 1990a) </ref>. Then, we show how the speech acts of requesting and informing compose, using as an example, the asking of a yes-no question. <p> Speech acts that take actions as arguments, such as requests, should be able to take other speech acts as arguments. Moreover the appropriateness and success conditions of the composite communicative act should be based 5 In <ref> (Cohen & Levesque 1990a) </ref>, we define two types of intention, those to do actions and those to achieve propositions 6 In a more adequate analysis, there should be a stronger relationship, say contingent causality, between and . on those of the elementary ones. <p> However, the general framework for artificial agents differs somewhat from our 7 A command speech act would be identical to a request except that instead of involving helpfulness, the intent would be relative to some sort of authority relationship between the speaker and the addressee. `Helpfulness' is defined in <ref> (Cohen & Levesque 1990a) </ref>. analysis of the human case Our notion of an attempt included a commitment to making an "honest effort," which requires an agent to overcome obstacles to successful delivery and understanding of the message. <p> Thus, we assume that (BMB y x (GOAL x 9e'[3 (DONE y ff) ^ (INTEND 1 y ff (GOAL x [3 (DONE y ff) ^ 8 Note that we could derive conditions under which it comes true, as in <ref> (Cohen & Levesque 1990a) </ref>. 9 The case of "I don't know" would handled by the need to discharge the standing joint intention (Cohen & Levesque 1991) that underlies the agent architecture, namely that agents jointly intend to interact. (HELPFUL y x)]))])) where ff is fINFORM y x e' pg j fINFORM <p> Furthermore, our analysis of the relationship between (P-GOAL y q) and 3q (described in Theorem 4.5 in <ref> (Cohen & Levesque 1990a, p. 239) </ref> indicates that this conclusion can be drawn provided that y remains competent about q (i.e., whenever y comes to believe q, it is correct), and y does not drop its goal to achieve q believing it never will be true.

Reference-contexts: Essentially, the speaker is asserting that this utterance is a request, order, or whatever. When does saying so make it so? There are a number of cases to be considered, but we only discuss one here (for a more complete discussion, see <ref> (Cohen. & Levesque 1990b) </ref>). Performative uses of illocutionary verbs succeed because, on our analysis, such verbs are defined as attempts. That is, the semantics of the il-locutionary act is that the speaker is attempting to communicate his/her mental state. <p> In most cases, then, the listener will immediately assume the speaker is in the requisite mental state, and the act succeeds. (See <ref> (Cohen. & Levesque 1990b) </ref> for proofs of the relevant theorems.) Importantly, it should be noticed that many verbs, namely, perlocutionary verbs, cannot be used performatively.

Reference-contexts: This lack of a semantics has not gone unnoticed, as Labrou and Finin (Labrou & Finin 1994) have attempted an initial semantics using a simple pre/post-condition analysis of speech acts, loosely based on Searle and Van-derveken's multidimensional semantics (Searle & Van-derveken 1985). We have discussed elsewhere <ref> (Cohen & Levesque 1990c) </ref> problems with this type of semantics, specifically that much of what is stipulated can be derived. As an example, of the kind of semantics we believe is called for, we review our analysis of speech acts, which is appropriate to both human and artificial agents. <p> Moreover, we will for now adopt the strong assumption that agents that are part of the network are in fact sincere, although the semantics provided does not depend on sincerity. Our definition of sincerity from <ref> (Cohen & Levesque 1990c) </ref> is: Definition 4 Sincerity | (SINCERE x y p) def 8e (GOAL x (HAPPENS x e; (BEL y p)?)) (GOAL x (HAPPENS x (KNOW y p))?) In other words, agent x is sincere to y about p if whenever x wants y to come to believe p, <p> For example, a request to perform the action fClosedWindow?;e';OpenWindow?g is a request to open the window. Complete definitions and an extensive justification of the various conditions can be found in <ref> (Cohen & Levesque 1990c) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: So, represents some ultimate goal that may or may not be achieved by the attempt, while represents what it takes to make an honest effort. 6 Adequacy Criteria for a Semantics for Communicative Actions In Cohen and Perrault <ref> (Cohen & Perrault 1979) </ref> we provided a strong adequacy criterion for theories of human speech acts, namely compositionality. Speech acts that take actions as arguments, such as requests, should be able to take other speech acts as arguments. <p> Thus, yes-no and wh-questions should be correctly handled as composite speech acts, with the proper semantics derived from both request and inform (Cohen & Perrault 1979; Perrault & Allen 1980; Sadek 1991). Similarly, a request should properly embed a request to an intermediating agent <ref> (Cohen & Perrault 1979) </ref>, and provide reasonable conditions on the knowledge of the intermediating agent about the ultimate recipient. Appropriateness conditions that arise include whether or not the intermediating agent has to believe the recipient can in fact do the requested action. <p> As a last example, a proper semantics should distinguish among various kinds of requests, such as requests to Request, and Broker, Recruit, and Forward (in KQML). A third-party request involves one agent's requesting another to then request a third agent to perform an action <ref> (Cohen & Perrault 1979) </ref>. Because of the semantics we have given, the middle agent will need to have various beliefs and goals about the ultimate recipient.

Reference-contexts: Recently, a number of researchers have proposed artificial languages based on speech act theory as the foundation for interagent communication (External Interfaces Working Group 1993; Labrou & Finin 1994; McCarthy 1989; Shoham 1993; Sidner 1994). The most elaborate and developed of these is KQML <ref> (External Interfaces Working Group 1993) </ref>. In this language, agents communicate by passing so-called "performa-tives" to each other. <p> KQML offers an extensible set of so-called "perfor-matives" that specify what kinds of communications agents can have with one another. Examples include Achieve, Advertise, Ask-If, Ask-All, Broker, Deny, Error, Stream-All, Tell, Unachieve. For example, the following is the description of the "performative" Deny, taken from <ref> (External Interfaces Working Group 1993) </ref>: deny :content &lt;performative&gt; :language KQML :ontology &lt;word&gt; :in-reply-to &lt;expression&gt; :sender &lt;word&gt; :receiver &lt;word&gt; Performatives of this type indicate that the meaning of the embedded &lt;performative&gt; is not true of the sender. A deny of a deny cancels out. <p> A deny of a deny cancels out. Communicative actions such as these are considered performatives in the sense that "the message is intended to perform some action in virtue of being sent" <ref> (External Interfaces Working Group 1993, p. 4) </ref>. Coupled with KQML is a set of policies that dictate constraints on legal sequences of communication acts, which are enforced through some combination of constraints on KQML developers, agent developers, and specific modules (e.g., the conversation module (Labrou & Finin 1994)). <p> These policies induce a set of interagent conversation patterns using the communication actions. Critique of KQML as an agent communication language We have identified three general difficulties with the draft KQML specification <ref> (External Interfaces Working Group 1993) </ref>. Ambiguity and vagueness. The meaning of the reserved or standard performatives is rather unclear. Performatives are given English glosses, which often are vague or ambiguous.

Reference-contexts: This completes a brief discussion of the foundational theory of intention and commitment. Next, we proceed to define the communicative actions. Illocutionary Acts as Attempts Searle <ref> (Searle 1969) </ref> points out that an essential condition for a request is that the speaker be attempting to get the addressee to perform the requested action. We take this observation one step further and define all illocutionary acts as attempts, hence defined in terms of the speaker's mental states. <p> To generalize, an agent could say both that it requests an act, and that it does not want the act done, etc. Thus, agents could deny the sincerity conditions or preparatory conditions <ref> (Searle 1969) </ref> of the relevant speech act. Without a semantics, this may not be detectable by an agent designer. It is unlikely, however, that the agent architecture could detect such semantic anomalies automatically.

Reference-contexts: For example, the so-called Achieve performative should be analyzed as a Request to achieve p, or in our framework, a request to do an e such that :p?;e;p?. To model the contract net protocol <ref> (Smith & Davis 1988) </ref>, a Bid action first needs to be defined, after which one can analyze Request for Bid. As a last example, a proper semantics should distinguish among various kinds of requests, such as requests to Request, and Broker, Recruit, and Forward (in KQML).
