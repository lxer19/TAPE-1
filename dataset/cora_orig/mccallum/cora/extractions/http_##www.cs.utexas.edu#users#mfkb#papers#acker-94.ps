Abstract: Viewpoints are coherent collections of facts that describe a concept from a particular perspective. They are essential for a wide variety of tasks, such as explanation generation and qualitative modeling. We have identified many types of viewpoints and developed a program, the View Retriever, for extracting them from knowledge bases, either singly or in combinations. The View Retriever provides a general solution to the central problem in extracting viewpoints: determining which facts are relevant to requested viewpoints. Our evaluation indicates that viewpoints extracted by the View Retriever are comparable in coherence to those people construct.

Reference-contexts: Basic Dimensions In addition to viewpoints that describe concepts in terms of more general concepts, the View Retriever can extract viewpoints along basic dimensions, which are general types of facts, such as facts about an object's structure, function, or appearance. (We have borrowed the term from Metaphors We Live By <ref> (Lakoff & John-son 1980) </ref>, a work that has significantly influenced our characterization of viewpoint types.) Below we describe the basic dimensions used by the View Retriever. Basic dimensions for objects: * Structural, which includes the parts or substances that make up the object.

Reference-contexts: Viewpoints created by the View Retriever along basic dimensions are similar to perspectives as suggested by Suthers (Suthers 1991) and as used by Romper <ref> (McCoy 1989) </ref>. Unlike our basic dimensions, however, Romper's perspectives are domain-specific and include only facts about the primary concept; interconnection relations are omitted. As-Having Viewpoints An as-having viewpoint contains all and only the information about a concept that is relevant to some specified fact about the concept.

Reference-contexts: Various explanation-generation systems extract knowledge structures similar to as-kind-of viewpoints. The TEXT system <ref> (McKeown 1985) </ref> uses a function (called the identification rhetorical predicate) to differentiate a concept from a more general concept.

Reference-contexts: Suthers's system uses a genus-and-differentia function similar to TEXT's identification predicate (Suthers 1991). McKeown's ADVISOR system constructs knowledge structures similar to as-kind-of viewpoints by restricting to predefined partitions of the knowledge base the superconcepts from which a concept can inherit slot fillers <ref> (McKeown 1988) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For each of 12 topics in botany, sets of facts were drawn from 3 sources: * a college-level botany textbook <ref> (Raven, Evert, & Curtis 1976) </ref>, * the View Retriever applied to the Botany Knowledge Base, and * facts selected randomly from a particular frame in the Botany Knowledge Base. The viewpoints ranged in size from 3 to 11 facts.

Reference-contexts: problem (as described in Section 2), and the viewpoints extracted by our methods are comparable in coherence to those people construct (as described in Section 3). 2 The View Retriever Our methods for accessing viewpoints are implemented in a program called the View Retriever (a term first proposed by Suthers <ref> (Suthers 1988) </ref>). The input to this program is a viewpoint specification and the output is a collection of facts. The task of the View Retriever is to determine which facts constitute the specified viewpoint and to request them from the knowledge base.

Reference-contexts: TEXT determines what facts to include using a type of knowledge called focus constraints: facts are selected incrementally based on their connection with previously selected facts, rather than a global coherence criteria. Suthers's system uses a genus-and-differentia function similar to TEXT's identification predicate <ref> (Suthers 1991) </ref>. McKeown's ADVISOR system constructs knowledge structures similar to as-kind-of viewpoints by restricting to predefined partitions of the knowledge base the superconcepts from which a concept can inherit slot fillers (McKeown 1988). <p> Based on our experience with the Botany Knowledge Base, this knowledge is easily encoded because the distinctions made by the basic dimensions are reflected in the top levels of the slot hierarchy. Viewpoints created by the View Retriever along basic dimensions are similar to perspectives as suggested by Suthers <ref> (Suthers 1991) </ref> and as used by Romper (McCoy 1989). Unlike our basic dimensions, however, Romper's perspectives are domain-specific and include only facts about the primary concept; interconnection relations are omitted.
