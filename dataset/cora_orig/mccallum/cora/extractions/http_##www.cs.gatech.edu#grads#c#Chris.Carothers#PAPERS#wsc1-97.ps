Abstract: The DoD High Level architecture (HLA) has recently become the required method for the interconnection of all DoD computer simulations. The HLA addresses the rules by which simulations are designed to facilitate interoperability, the method by which information exchanged between simulations is described, and a standard set of software services provided by a common Runtime Infrastructure (RTI). The RTI is responsible for the coordination of collections of cooperating simulations. The familiarization version of the RTI, dubbed F.0., was eveloped at the MITRE Corporation. The purpose of this version is to (i) educate the user community in the correct usage of the RTI, (ii) serve as a platform for introducing new ideas and concepts that will improve quality and effectiveness of the RTI, and (iii) provide a capability until commercial RTIs are available. One of the core components of the RTI is Time Management and is the focus of this paper. In particular, we present the design and algorithms used to implement the HLA Time Management Services in F.0.

Reference-contexts: Here, the RTI serves as a message passing library and time management services, while invoked, do not manage the federate's advancement of simulated time. This category of federates would be used in a DIS federation, such as Synthetic Theater of War (STOW) <ref> (Aronson 1996) </ref>, which uses a real-time clock that is external to the RTI to control the advance of simulated time. Because this federation contains non-time constrained federates, there is no need to schedule time stamp events, thus all federates have their time regulating property turned off.

Reference-contexts: Next, a newLT message that contains LT + currentLookahead and the request time is broadcast to all other federates along the reliable, FIFO, point-to-point communication links. This newLT message can be viewed as a null message from Chandy/Misra's null message algorithm <ref> (Chandy et. al. 1979) </ref>. When another time constrained federate's Time Manager receives the newLT message, the logical time plus looka-head value is stored and used to compute LBTS.

Reference-contexts: Because each service will not advance time until the RTI can unconditionally guarantee that all events less than or equal to some time t have been delivered, federates with a zero lookahead may cause the federation to deadlock <ref> (Fujimoto 1996) </ref>. Changes to allow zero lookahead federates have been developed and should appear in RTI version 1.0. 4 IMPLEMENTATION In designing the algorithms necessary to support all the requirements placed on the RTI by an unpredictable federate, every effort was made to avoid RTI modality.

Reference-contexts: Motivated by the above requirements list, we divided the range of federate types into four major categories based on two key properties that are used in the Aggregate Level Simulation Protocol (ALSP) <ref> (Weatherly et. al. 1991) </ref>: (i) time constrained and (ii) time regulating (see Figure 1). Federates that are time constrained, must receive events in time stamp order. Non-time constrained federates receives events in the order that they were received by the RTI.

Reference-contexts: The Adaptive Communication Environment (ACE) <ref> (Schmidt 1993) </ref> was chosen to support the communications layer of F.0 because it supported reliable communications between programs started by different users without having to resort to using "remote-shells", which has been shown to have security problems.
