Title: Explicit Communication Revisited: Two New Attacks on Authentication Protocols  
Author: Martn Abadi 
Date: March 9, 1997  
Affiliation: Systems Research Center Digital Equipment Corporation  
Abstract: SSH and AKA are recent, practical protocols for secure connections over an otherwise unprotected network. This paper shows that, despite the use of public-key cryptography, SSH and AKA do not provide authentication as intended. The flaws of SSH and AKA can be viewed as the result of their disregarding a basic principle for the design of sound authentication protocols: the principle that messages should be explicit.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, the signed statements of the protocols do not include some information that may be presumed obvious from context. The absence of this information opens the door to the attacks. These attacks should not be very surprising|in particular, Needham and the author have described a few similar ones <ref> [AN96] </ref>. Beyond documenting the attacks on SSH and AKA, the purpose of this paper is to provide additional evidence in favor of the following basic principle: Every message should say what it means: the interpretation of the message should depend only on its content. <p> It should be possible to write down a straightforward English sentence describing the content|though if there is a suitable formalism available that is good too. This paper is a short sequel to the paper where the basic principle is introduced <ref> [AN96] </ref>. Additional principles for public-key protocols appear in the work of Anderson and Needham [AN95].

Reference-contexts: In AKA, K Bs is in fact a one-time key. * fXg K represents X encrypted under K; anyone who knows fXg K and the inverse of K can obtain X. For shared-key cryptosystems, such as DES <ref> [DES77] </ref>, each key is its own inverse. For the RSA public-key cryptosystem, the public key and the private key in a key pair are 2 inverses of one another. In particular, if K is a private key, then fXg K is the result of signing X with K.

Reference-contexts: As an extreme example, certain signed statements in the SSL v3.0 protocol include hashes of all previous messages <ref> [FKK96] </ref>. These hashes impede attacks analogous to those described in this paper, found by the author on drafts of SSL v3.0 and of an earlier version of SSL. The SSL approach seems rather effective.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction SSH and AKA are two recent, practical protocols for secure connections over an otherwise unprotected network [Ylo96a, SSH96]; for example, they enable users to log into remote hosts. Both of the protocols rely on public-key cryptography for authentication (specifically, on RSA <ref> [RSA78] </ref>). In addition to authentication, each of the protocols has other significant goals, such as confidentiality. This paper presents attacks on both of the protocols: it shows that SSH allows clients to be impersonated, while AKA allows servers to be impersonated.
