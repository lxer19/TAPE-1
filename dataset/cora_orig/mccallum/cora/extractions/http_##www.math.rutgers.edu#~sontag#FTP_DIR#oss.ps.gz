Abstract: We propose a definition of detectability for nonlinear systems. This definition generalizes naturally the standard property in the linear case, and is consistent with the "input to state stability" approach to controlled stability. We provide a characterization in terms of a dissipation inequality involving storage (Lyapunov) functions.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, it is almost the same as (actually, a particular case of) the notion called "strong unboundedness observability" in <ref> [1] </ref>; in that paper, the authors were also motivated by combining the above-mentioned definitions of (weak) detectability and observability. We call the above property, from now on, input/output to state stability (ioss). The question, of course, is what interesting properties can be proved when using this definition. <p> We now define g : X! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> by g (~) = supfjz (s; ~)j : s 2 [0; ~ )g (7) for each ~ 2 E , where E is the open set: E = Xn D = f~ : j~j &gt; (jh (~)j)g; (8) and g (~) = 0 if ~ 2 D. <p> Thus, jh (z (s; )j &gt; 1 for all s near zero. Claim: jh (z (s; ))j &gt; 1 for all s 2 <ref> [1; 0] </ref>. Assume the claim is false. Then there must exist some 1 s 0 &lt; 0 so that s 0 = maxfs 0 : jh (z (s; ))j 1g: We have that for each s 2 (s 0 ; 0], jh (z (s; ))j &gt; 1. <p> ~)) ff 4 (V 0 (x (t; ~))) for all t 2 [0; ^ ~ ), where ^ ~ = infft 2 [0; t max ) : x (t; ~) 62 E 1 g: To construct a Lyapunov function defined everywhere, consider a smooth function ' : Xn f0g ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> with the property that '(~) = 1; if (jh (~)j) j~j =3 and ' is nonzero elsewhere. Note that such a smooth function exists because the two sets f (jh (~)j) j~j =3g and f (jh (~)j) j~j =2g are two disjoint closed subsets of Xn f0g.

Reference-contexts: class K, that is zero at zero, strictly increasing, and continuous, and fi is a function of class KL, i.e. it decreases to zero on t and is of class K on x. for the more special case in which ff 3 (s) = s 2 ; see for instance <ref> [2] </ref>. It is easy to see that the "dissipation" characterization given by the estimate (1) implies ioss (the proof is similar to the proof given below for the special case of u 0). The main contribution of the current work is to investigate the converse implication.

Reference-contexts: There have been many attempts to generalize this concept to not necessarily linear systems of the type _x = f (x; u), y = h (x). A state-space definition, which allows showing a version of "i/o stabilizable = detectable plus state stabilizable" was proposed in the paper <ref> [4] </ref>. The definition was that under zero inputs, states whose outputs are identically zero should form an asymptotically stable subsystem. <p> That is, estimates on trajectories are only required to be asymptotic rather than uniform in time. Thus, when combined with the definition in <ref> [4] </ref>, it makes sense to define detectability as the property that states should converge to zero when inputs and outputs are zero, and in general be ultimately bounded by a bound that depends only on the magnitude of inputs and outputs.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction This paper proposes two notions of detectability for nonlinear systems and shows their equivalence. Recall (see e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>, Chapter 6) that detectability (or "asymptotic observability") for linear systems with no controls _x = Ax, y = Cx is the property that x (t) ! 0 for every trajectory for which the output is identically zero: Cx (t) 0.

Reference-contexts: Since input perturbations are not taken into account in the definition, however, this notion is too weak; it has the disadvantage of not being "robust" enough to input or measurement disturbances. On the other hand, the paper <ref> [6] </ref> gave a definition of "observ-ability" for nonlinear systems which does naturally incorporate such robustness, since it is expressed in the language of "input to state stability" (cf. [7]). <p> We do not yet know if this can always be insured. Sufficiency is an easy consequence of this lemma, which is basically in page 441 of <ref> [6] </ref>) and is easy to prove: Lemma 2.2 For each continuous and positive definite function ff : [0; 1) ! R 0 , there exists a KL-function fi ff with the following property: for any absolutely contin uous function w : [0; T ] ! R 0 and any number v

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the paper [6] gave a definition of "observ-ability" for nonlinear systems which does naturally incorporate such robustness, since it is expressed in the language of "input to state stability" (cf. <ref> [7] </ref>). Observability was defined there, essentially, as the property that "small inputs and small outputs should imply small state trajectories" and "bounded inputs and outputs imply bounded trajectories". This generalizes the linear concept of ob-servability in a natural manner.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1 System (2) is oss if and only it admits an oss-Lyapunov function. We wish to note that the proof of the main result is not an immediate application of the converse theorem for the iss property given in <ref> [8] </ref>. (Superficially it would appear that it is enough to replace u by y in the iss definition and hence obtain oss, but the roles of controls and outputs are very different; most importantly, it is not possible to concatenate pieces of output trajectores and obtain a valid output, as it <p> the iss definition and hence obtain oss, but the roles of controls and outputs are very different; most importantly, it is not possible to concatenate pieces of output trajectores and obtain a valid output, as it is the case with inputs, and this fact is essential in the proof in <ref> [8] </ref>.) As a matter of fact, a proof along the lines of that in [8] would provide an infinitely differentiable function V of x. We do not yet know if this can always be insured. <p> are very different; most importantly, it is not possible to concatenate pieces of output trajectores and obtain a valid output, as it is the case with inputs, and this fact is essential in the proof in <ref> [8] </ref>.)
