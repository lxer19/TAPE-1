Reference-contexts: We consider the set X n of domain points on t 2 associated with u, and call the sets R n [ X n and u = j=0 u = fx ff;t : ff u k n; t 2 g the nth ring and nth disk around u, respectively (cf. <ref> [1] </ref>). The following result implies that P is a minimal determining set for the space S 1 4 (). Theorem 2. <p> We first prove that P is a determining set. Let us arrange the vertices in an appropriate order and extend b to the B-net coordinates b g of g as follows. (i) If u is an even-degree interior vertex with deg (u) 6, then according to Lemma 6 in <ref> [1] </ref>, we can determine the b g values on all of the domain points in D 2 u by using the given values on P. (ii) Any of the remaining vertices must be a boundary vertex, an odd-degree vertex, or an interior vertex with deg (u) = 4. <p> From (i) and the choice of the set P, we see that the midpoints of all the edges are uniquely determined. Therefore, by the lemmas 2-5 in <ref> [1] </ref>, it is clear that the b g values can be uniquely determined on all the domain points in D 2 u . Fig. 2. Elements (?) in the determining set. <p> This is also valid for any vertex with the exception the nonsigu-lar ones with degree 4. If u is a nonsingular vertex with deg (u) = 4, then by Lemma 5 in <ref> [1] </ref>, the determinant of the coefficient matrix for solving b g j D 2 u nP is a nonzero according to our choice of P and it is also independent of b and jj. This completes the proof of the theorem.

Reference-contexts: It is well-known that with the 3-directional mesh (1) (as shown in Fig. 1 (a)), the spline space S 1 4 ( (1) ) only admits the 4th order of approximation (cf. <ref> [2] </ref>), while we will show in this paper that the new triangulation b (as shown in Fig. 1 (b)), obtained by applying our algorithm, guarantees the 5th order of approximation from S 1 4 ( b ). This paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: Preliminaries and Statement of Main Results The B-net representations of pp functions will play an important role in our discussion. For completeness, we give a very brief review of such representations. More details can be found in the spline literature, such as <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 Recall that to any positive integer k, a Bernstein-Bezier polynomial basis of degree k is given by B ff;t (x) = jffj ff ~ ff ; ff = (ff u ; ff v ; ff w ) 2 ZZ 3 + ; jffj := ff u + ff v

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Among the many methods for scattered data interpolation (approximation) on a polygonal domain (see <ref> [5] </ref>), a class of methods is based on triangulating with the sample sites as the only vertices of the triangulation.

Reference-contexts: Then it is clear that fs 1 ; ; s d g is a basis of S 1 4 (). We will show that this basis is local. For this purpose, let us first recall the notion of a closed star St (u) with vertex u <ref> [7, p.135] </ref> in a triangulation defined as the union of all the triangles in with u as the common vertex.

Reference-contexts: Every interior edge e of a triangulation is the diagonal of a quadrilateral Q e which is the union of two triangles of with common edge e. Following <ref> [8] </ref>, we say that e is a swappable edge if Q e is convex and no three of its vertices are colinear. If an edge e of a triangulation is swappable, then we can create a new triangulation by swapping the edge.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we have jPj = 3jV I j + 4jV b j + jEj + : where, as usual, jAj denotes the cardinality of a set A. Furthermore, it follows from <ref> [9] </ref> that dim S 1 Hence P must also be a minimal determining set for S 1 4 (), and consequently, the dimen sion of the space S 1 4 () over a type-O triangulation is given by dim S 1 so that the extension b g of b is also
