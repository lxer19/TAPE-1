Abstract: Reversibility is the only way to compute with asymptotically zero power, and is a novel approach to low power, low energy computing. Recent implementations of reversible and adiabatic [13, 6] logic in standard CMOS silicon processes have motivated further research into reversible computing. The application of reversible computing techniques to reduce energy dissipation of current generation CMOS circuits has so far been found to be limited, but the techniques used to design reversible computers are interesting in and of themselves, and other technologies, such as Josephson Junctions and quantum computers as well as future CMOS technologies, may require fully reversible logic. This paper discusses the design of a fully reversible microprocessor architecture. The initial motivation for reversible computing research came from an investigation of fundamental limits of energy dissipation during computation [7]. The link between entropy in the information science sense and entropy in the thermodynamics sense, exhibited by Maxwell's demon, requires a minimum energy dissipation of k B T ln 2, where k B is Boltzmann's constant, when a bit is erased. Erasing a bit is a logically irreversible operation with a physically irreversible effect. A reversible computer avoids bit erasure. Judicious application of reversibility in adiabatic circuits has already proven its usefulness in reducing energy dissipation [2]. This paper examines the complexity and difficulty in avoiding bit erasure entirely and discusses a set of techniques for designing reversible systems. fl This work is supported by DARPA contract DABT63-95-C-0130

Reference-contexts: Conventional CMOS circuits have a minimum dissipation associated with each compute operation that changes the state of the output node, regardless of operation frequency. So-called adiabatic techniques, in which the dissipation per compute operation is proportional to the operation frequency, have shown themselves to be useful in practical applications <ref> [9, 2] </ref>. As mentioned above, adiabatic operation requires that the circuits perform logically reversible operations. If one attempts to implement a conventional instruction set in a reversible logic family, reversibility will be broken at the circuit level when the instruction set specifies an irreversible operation.

Reference-contexts: This break in reversibility translates to a required energy dissipation. 3 The Pendulum Instruction Set The particular implementation discussed here is known as the Pendulum processor. The Pendulum processor was originally based on the elegantly simple MIPS RISC architecture <ref> [5] </ref>. The register-to-register operations, fixed instruction length, and simple memory access instructions make it a good starting point for a radically different approach to instruction set design. For ease of implementation, and of course to maintain reversibility, the instruction set has been substantially modified.

From a system point of view, the only additional requirement of a reversible memory, beyond a traditional memory system's function, is that it not erase bits when it is read from and written to.
