Reference-contexts: We are planning to develop: statistical test of the difference between the distributions in a CN2 <ref> [1] </ref> manner, adopted for continuous distributions. minimal amount of allowed error will be employed as a part of the stopping criterion. This will prevent Fors from overspecializing in noisy domains.

Reference-contexts: The task is to determine roughness of the workpiece from the properties of the sound produced during the process of steel grinding. 123 examples were available, described in terms of three attributes. Detailed description of the domain together with the previous work can be found in <ref> [3, 2, 5, 4] </ref>. Domain definition file is: roughness 3 SpArea CONT MaxAreaX CONT AreaCX CONT The examples file can be found in Appendix A. Background knowledge: bkl ( '&lt;='(+A,+B) ).

Reference-contexts: One important characteristic of ILP is also that in addition to learning examples, a learning algorithm is also given some background knowledge about the domain <ref> [6] </ref>. However, ILP algorithms usually aren't especially concerned with handling of continuous variables, although such variables are rather common when dealing with real-life domains [8].

Reference-contexts: For each part a separate submodel should be constructed. * Modelling of dynamical systems, * Applicability to real-life data. This means that certain noise-handling mechanisms should be incorporated in the algorithm. 5 3 Algorithm We decided to use FOIL-like <ref> [7] </ref> partitioning algorithm for model induction. General form of the induced model is a Prolog program consisting of induced clauses of the form: f (Class,Att1,Att2,...,AttN) :- Literal1, ... LiteralN1. and clauses which comprise background knowledge. In every induced clause one of the literals instantiates Class.

Reference-contexts: This is further confirmed by the fact, that as we see further developement of the system, several numeric routines will be included. Therefore, all data structures are stored as C structures and converted to Prolog structures prior to calling SICStus prolog. The conversion is performed using the following routines <ref> [9] </ref>: void SP_put_variable (SP_term *t) /* Creates a new variable. */ void SP_put_integer (SP_term *t, long l) /* Creates a Prolog integer from a C long integer. */ void SP_put_float (SP_term *t, char *name) /* Creates an atom from a C string. */ void SP_put_compound (SP_term *t, char *name, int arity)

Reference-contexts: The mixture is described in terms of 8 attributes. There were only 18 learning examples available for the experiments. Details of the domain and the previous work are available in <ref> [10] </ref>. The domain definition file is: Yarn_Strength 8 Fibre_Strength CONT Maturity CONT Fineness CONT Mean_Length CONT Classers_Length CONT Prc_Under_10mm CONT Weight_%_Under_10mm CONT Prc_Above_Mean_Length CONT The examples file can be found in Appendix C.
