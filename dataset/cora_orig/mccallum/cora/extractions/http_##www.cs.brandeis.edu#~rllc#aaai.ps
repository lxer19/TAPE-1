Reference-contexts: Approaches taken to the interpretation of complex nom-inals in the linguistic literature <ref> (e.g. Levi 1978, Warren 1978) </ref>, succeed in enumerating the different subtypes of complex nominals that show up in compounds but do not provide discovery procedures for disambiguating between these subtypes.

Reference-contexts: Previous work on the interpretation of complex nominals is not sufficiently general to be applied to large-scale domain independent tasks such as this. Approaches taken in the artificial intelligence and computational linguistics literature <ref> (e.g. McDonald 1982, Alshawi 1987) </ref> crucially rely on the existence of domain models. Domain models can be successfully hand-coded for the task of complex nominal interpretation in limited individual domains.

Reference-contexts: This work is situated within the framework of the Generative Lexicon (GL) <ref> (Pustejovsky 1991, 1994) </ref>. This paper describes our methodology for the acquisition of complex nominals from corpora, and how assuming a particular size and type of text (the closed corpus assumption), these acquired complex nominals and their subparts can be automatically assigned representations which capture aspects of their semantic interpretation.

Reference-contexts: In order to establish the basic semantic type of a given head, the lexical conceptual paradigms (henceforth LCPs) in which it appears are examined. These lexical conceptual paradigms are syntactic configurations and alternations which are prototypical of particular semantic types of entities <ref> (see Pustejovsky et al., 1993) </ref>. Once the basic semantic type of the head is established, its qualia structure and the qualia structures of the TCNs in which it appears are determined incrementally from the corpus.
