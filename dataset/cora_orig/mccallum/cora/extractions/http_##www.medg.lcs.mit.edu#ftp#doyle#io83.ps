Abstract: To progress significantly beyond current reason maintenance systems, we must formulate their structure and intended behavior precisely enough to analyze computational complexities and tradeoffs independently of the current set of limited implementation proposals. This paper summarizes one such formulation, and indicates some unsolved practical problems for investigation in future reason maintenance systems. This paper will be presented at IJCAI-83.
