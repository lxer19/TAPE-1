Abstract: A neural network model called LISSOM for the cooperative self-organization of afferent and lateral connections in cortical maps is applied to modeling cortical plasticity. After self-organization, the LISSOM maps are in a dynamic equilibrium with the input, and reorganize like the cortex in response to simulated cortical lesions and intracortical microstimulation. The model predicts that adapting lateral interactions are fundamental to cortical reorganization, and suggests techniques to hasten recovery following sensory cortical surgery.

Reference-contexts: Much new evidence indicates that the adult cortex undergoes significant, often reversible, reorganization in response to various sensory and cortical manipulations such as lesions in the receptive surface and the cortex (for review see <ref> [1; 2] </ref>). The cortex appears to be a continuously adapting structure in a dynamic equilibrium with both the external and intrinsic input. This equilibrium is maintained by cooperative and competitive lateral interactions within the cortex, mediated by lateral connections.

Immediately after the lesion, the receptive fields (RFs) of neurons in the perilesion zone enlarge. The lesion reduces the inhibition of the perilesion neurons, and unmasks previously suppressed input activation.

Reference-contexts: This article shows that adapting lateral interactions could be responsible for the experimentally observed plasticity of cortical maps as well. Several aspects of cortical plasticity can be explained based on self-organizing neural network models of topographic maps <ref> [3; 5] </ref>. Such models assume predetermined lateral interactions within the cortex, and focus on the reorganization of the afferent connection weights.

Reference-contexts: In the somatosen-sory cortex, after a few hours of ICMS stimulation, the receptive fields of the stimulated neurons became clustered and overlapping <ref> [4] </ref>. Because there is no peripheral stimulation, such clustering must be solely due to the adaptation of intrinsic connections. To simulate the effect of ICMS, a restricted region of the organized network was set to maximum activity for several steps. <p> As a result, the receptive fields of neurons in the close vicinity of the ICMS region appeared to shift into the region, as was observed in the somatosensory cortex <ref> [4] </ref>. 5 CONCLUSION The LISSOM model demonstrates that not only the self-organization of topographic maps, but also many aspects of cortical plasticity can be explained based on the simultaneous adaptation of afferent and lateral connections.
