Abstract: In this paper, we briefly describe two interior-point algorithms for semidefinite programming. At each iteration, both these algorithms compute search directions by solving a linear system. We discuss some preliminary experiments for moderately sized, block diagonal semidefinite programs, comparing direct and iterative methods for solving the linear systems.

Reference-contexts: SDP reduces to linear programming (LP) in the case q = <ref> [1; : : : ; 1] </ref>. We assume that the A k are linearly independent, i.e. they span an m-dimensional linear subspace of B q , and that there exist strictly positive definite, feasible solutions X and Z. SDP enjoys a duality theory akin to that for linear programming [1]. <p> We assume that the A k are linearly independent, i.e. they span an m-dimensional linear subspace of B q , and that there exist strictly positive definite, feasible solutions X and Z. SDP enjoys a duality theory akin to that for linear programming <ref> [1] </ref>. The dual of (1) is: max b T y m X y k A k + Z = C; Z - 0 (2) where Z 2 B q is a positive semidefinite dual slack variable. <p> The necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality are primal feasibility (1), dual feasibility (2), together with the complemen tarity condition XZ = 0: (3) 2. Interior-Point Algorithms In this section, we summarize two primal-dual interior-point algorithms discussed in <ref> [1] </ref>, namely the XZ + ZX and the XZ methods. The XZ method was originally proposed by [2, 3], and we use an implementation suggested by [4]. <p> The Newton correction (X; y; Z) is given by a linear system of equations involving J, the Jacobian of F . This system can be reduced to a compact Schur complement system in y alone by performing block Gauss elimination (see <ref> [1] </ref> for details). We now describe how to form the Schur complement system. Form the matrix B, whose k th column is svec T k , where T k is the solution to the Lyapunov equation: ZT k + T k Z = XA k + A k X. <p> Several factors are responsible for this behavior. In general, for both the XZ + ZX and the XZ methods, the Schur complement M becomes progressively ill-conditioned, and is, in fact, singular in the limit <ref> [1] </ref> as ! 0. First, the ill-conditioning of M results in inaccurate search directions. Consequently, there is a substantial loss of primal feasibility, although the gap reduction itself is satisfactory. The overall effect is an increase the number of outer iterations. <p> In this case, the XZ + ZX method might be expected to give better results, since J for this method is nonsingular as ! 0; for the XZ method, J becomes singular in the limit as is driven down to zero <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Interior-Point Algorithms In this section, we summarize two primal-dual interior-point algorithms discussed in [1], namely the XZ + ZX and the XZ methods. The XZ method was originally proposed by <ref> [2, 3] </ref>, and we use an implementation suggested by [4]. Given a starting point, both methods solve the primal and the dual SDP's simultaneously by applying Newton's method to a perturbed form of the optimality conditions (1), (2) and (3). However, the way they formulate the complementarity condition is different.

Reference-contexts: The first system (predictor step or affine scaling step) decreases the objective value, while the second system (corrector step or centering step) brings the next iterate close to the so-called central path <ref> [5] </ref>. The details are given in the algorithm below. SDP Algorithm Input: A; b; C; X 0 ; y 0 ; Z 0 Output: X; y; Z approximate solutions to the primal and the dual SDP's.
