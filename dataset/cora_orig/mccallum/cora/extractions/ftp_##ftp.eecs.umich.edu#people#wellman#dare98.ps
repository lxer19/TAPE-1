Abstract: Designers of online auction mechanisms face many interesting choices related to the timing of events. We discuss several temporal issues that arise in the context of auction mechanisms, and argue that it is generally advantageous to design for maximal asynchrony and robustness to network delays. The design of a configurable auction server (the Michigan Internet Auction-Bot) exemplifies these principles, and our experience in operating the AuctionBot illustrates the consequences of this approach for real-time performance.

Reference-contexts: Both classes of auctions may also be further distinguished according to their particular rules of operation, specifying such features as bidding restrictions, event timing, information revelation, and pricing and allocation policies. Indeed, all of the commonly studied auction types <ref> [1, 2, 4] </ref> can be placed within a taxonomy of possible auctions. We based our configurable auction server on a particular parametrization of this space of possibilities [5, 10].

Reference-contexts: Another form of open outcry auction is the familiar "trading pit" of a commodities or securities exchange. Although this might not be viewed as an auction in common parlance, it clearly falls well within the scope of the technical definition of auction <ref> [2] </ref>| essentially, any well-specified mechanism for determi-nating the terms of an exchange. 1 Even the seemingly chaotic trading pit operates according to rules governing who is allowed to shout what and when, and what the shouts entail in terms of offers of exchange. <p> Both classes of auctions may also be further distinguished according to their particular rules of operation, specifying such features as bidding restrictions, event timing, information revelation, and pricing and allocation policies. Indeed, all of the commonly studied auction types <ref> [1, 2, 4] </ref> can be placed within a taxonomy of possible auctions. We based our configurable auction server on a particular parametrization of this space of possibilities [5, 10]. <p> This process leads to a result equivalent to a sealed-bid process, where the price paid is that of the second-highest bid, plus the increment ffi. Thus, under a well-known auction analysis <ref> [2] </ref>, this approach corresponds exactly to the English auction, which in turn is considered strategically equivalent (modulo ffi) to the second-price or Vickrey auction [8].

Reference-contexts: In the latter example, note that it is the sellers (of construction services) doing the bidding. Sealed-bid auctions may be one-shot, or may involve complex iterations over multiple rounds, as in the prominent US FCC spectrum auctions held in recent years <ref> [3] </ref>. Like open outcry, sealed-bid auctions may also come in one-sided or two-sided varieties. Both classes of auctions may also be further distinguished according to their particular rules of operation, specifying such features as bidding restrictions, event timing, information revelation, and pricing and allocation policies.

Reference-contexts: The entire auction protocol comprises the mechanism, plus the behaviors of participating bidders. 2 See Ungar et al. for a recent discussion <ref> [7] </ref>.

This very familiarity is a sufficient reason to adopt this approach. 3 However, few (if any) popular sites attempt to conduct protocols that are "real-time" open outcry in the sense that o*ine auctions tend to be.
