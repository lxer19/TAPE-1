Abstract: This paper considers optical networks which employ wavelength-routing switches that enable the establishment of wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) connections between node-pairs. In such networks, when there is no wavelength conversion, a connection is constrained to be on the same wavelength channel along its route. Alternate routing improves the blocking performance of such networks by providing multiple possible paths between node-pairs. Wavelength conversion improves the blocking performance of such networks by allowing a connection to use different wavelengths along its route. This paper proposes an approximate computational model that incorporates alternate routing and wavelength conversion. The model is shown to give reasonably good estimates of different parameters in the network including the blocking probability and link utilizations. This paper performs empirical studies based on discrete-event simulation, of the relationships between alternate routing and wavelength conversion, on three representative network topologies. The paper compares the gains in blocking probability due to alternate routing with the corresponding gains due to wavelength conversion, and demonstrates that alternate routing provides more benefits than wavelength conversion, and that it is important to design alternate routes between node-pairs in an optimized fashion to exploit the connectivity of the network topology. The empirical results also indicate that fixed-alternate routing with a small number of alternate routes asymptotically approaches adaptive-shortest-cost path routing in blocking performance.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction: Wavelength Routing, Wavelength Conversion, and Al- ternate Routing Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) divides the tremendous bandwidth of a fiber (potentially a few tens of terabits per second (Tbps)) into many nonoverlapping wavelengths (WDM channels) <ref> [1] </ref>. Each channel can be operated asynchronously and in parallel at any desirable speed, e.g., peak electronic speed of a few gigabits per second (Gbps). An access node may transmit signals on different wavelengths, which are coupled into the fiber using wavelength multiplexers.

Reference-contexts: If no available route is found from the list of alternate routes, then the connection request is blocked and lost. Fixed-alternate 4 routing provides benefits such as: (a) simplicity of control to setup and teardown lightpaths, and (b) fault tolerance upon link failures <ref> [2] </ref>. A direct route between a source node s and a destination node d is defined as the first route in the list of routes to d in the routing table at s. <p> Path models for a wavelength-continuous path have been proposed in [9, 11]. Least-congested routing in wavelength-routed optical networks has been examined in [11, 12]. Alternate routing has been extensively researched in circuit-switched telecommunication networks <ref> [2, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] </ref>. Fixed-point approximation models for circuit-switched telecommunications networks with alternate routing have been studied in [2], and for state-dependent routing in [13, 14, 17]. <p> Least-congested routing in wavelength-routed optical networks has been examined in [11, 12].

Fixed-point approximation models for circuit-switched telecommunications networks with alternate routing have been studied in <ref> [2] </ref>, and for state-dependent routing in [13, 14, 17]. Our work focuses on the interplay between fixed-alternate routing and wavelength conversion and in this respect it is different from previous work. <p> The routing analysis consists of a set of equations that determine link-offered traffic from the path-blocking probabilities. The path-blocking analysis consists of a set of equations that determine the path-blocking probabilities from the link-offered traffic. An iterative method of repeated substitution <ref> [2, 14] </ref> is employed to solve the system of fixed-point non-linear equations that result from the analysis.

Reference-contexts: One event when this assumption (that routes block independently) is violated is when alternate routes share links. For example, routes r (3) and r (4) in Fig. 4 share a link and therefore blocking on r (3) is related to blocking on r (4). Reference <ref> [18] </ref> presents a model that takes into account the dependencies (due to shared links) between the blocking probabilities of alternate routes. 3.5 Carried Load on a Link The carried load on link j, v j , is the sum of the carried loads on all routes on which link j is
