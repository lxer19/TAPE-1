Abstract: The need for simulation in medical environments increases with the complexity and risks of operations. Especially exact geometric planning is one of the main problems a surgeon has to deal with. The goal of our research is the development of a graphical simulation of the human mastication system. Therefore, we are developing an integrated model of the jaw by parameterizing the bones (maxilla and mandible) and modeling the motion capabilities as well as the mastication muscles. The main focus of this paper is the introduction of a kinematic model of the temporomandibu-lar joint and the modeling of the mastication muscles. The

Reference-contexts: The first researchers used a functional rotation axis which describes the movement of the mandible by one virtual rotation axis. This is only possible for the initial opening and closing period. In <ref> [2] </ref> an overview of the different approaches can be found. Unfortunately, these approaches are only correct for a discrete section of the jaw movement. Additionally they are not transferable into a computer based simulation. To get a better view on the occlusion, physicians use articulators.

Reference-contexts: These kinematic models are relatively simple if single rotation axes for each joint can be identified. For most human joints, this is a suitable approach [7]. Some of these projects introducing simple models have been carried out in the movie industries to animate computer models <ref> [3] </ref>, [16]. Due to its complexity, it is not possible to use one axis for modeling the temporomandibular joint as we will show in chapter 3. The first researchers used a functional rotation axis which describes the movement of the mandible by one virtual rotation axis. <p> The goal of this kinematic study is to find a good approximation of the TMJ with an accuracy of 1mm. We applied robotic research to the problem of finding an appropriate kinematic model <ref> [3] </ref>, [9]. Our model consists of a sequential open-loop chain with rigid bodies connected by revolute joints. We therefore had to identify the rotation axes for the three basic movements. A rotation axis for the opening position is intuitively the hinge axis.

Reference-contexts: This representation consists of a surface mesh corresponding the surface of the original muscle. A static 3D image of the muscle can be extracted from MRT images using segmentation and surface construction <ref> [5] </ref>. The dynamic 3D image can be calculated by dynamic deformations. Since the volume of the muscles stays constant a change in length can be converted in a change of the diameter of the muscle. <p> Furthermore, the specific data set of the patient can be segmented and used. After conversion into a triangular surface data set, they can be visualized. This conversion has been done using the Splitting-Box algorithm [17], which is an enhancement of the Marching-Cubes algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. A faster visualization has been reached by reducing the number of triangles. Special functions were implemented to allow the definition of the rotation axes and the range of the minimal and maximal angles. The user can do this either interactively using the mouse or textually entering the cartesian coordinates.

Reference-contexts: Due to the fact that the combination of the three rotations produces complex trigonometric terms the solution can not be calculated analytically. We evaluated different methods to solve the problem of the inverse kinematics: * Using machine learning <ref> [6] </ref> and trained a neural net work with the kinematic model to find an approximation for the inverse kinematics. This approach is used in robotics for difficult kinematics. But the method also has disadvantages.

Reference-contexts: Whenever joint motions are simulated, kinematic models have to be established [9]. These kinematic models are relatively simple if single rotation axes for each joint can be identified. For most human joints, this is a suitable approach <ref> [7] </ref>. Some of these projects introducing simple models have been carried out in the movie industries to animate computer models [3], [16]. Due to its complexity, it is not possible to use one axis for modeling the temporomandibular joint as we will show in chapter 3. <p> As mentioned above, the inclusion of muscles into the time independent kinematic model is an important aspect. In literature there exist two different approaches to solve this problem: the functional modeling of the muscles using muscle-threads which symbolize the force vector of a muscle ([20], <ref> [7] </ref>, [15]) and the geometrical modeling of the muscles using the finite element method or other deformable models ([4], [8], [22], [23]). A graphical simulation of the mandible movement is not known to the authors.

Reference-contexts: Kinematic models play an important role in robotics in order to calculate the joint angle and the cartesian position <ref> [9] </ref>. We could show that the same principles can be applied and facilitate the functional model of the mandible. This paper presents an approach to model the kinematics of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and to simulate the human mastication apparatus. <p> An optimal occlusion is the goal of any dental therapy. Dysfunctions in the area of the TMJ entail a disorder of the occlusion like the supernatural wear, loosening of the teeth, and severe pain disorders. Whenever joint motions are simulated, kinematic models have to be established <ref> [9] </ref>. These kinematic models are relatively simple if single rotation axes for each joint can be identified.

Reference-contexts: There exist some computer animations of the mandible movement, like for computer-aided production of ceramic dental restorations and diagnosis for occlusal therapy as the Intelligent Dental Care System (IDCS) <ref> [10] </ref>. This system provides a playback of the recorded jaw movement and can be used as a software articulator. Since those systems do not build a kinematic model of the jaw movement which can be changed, there exists no simulation of jaw replacements.

Reference-contexts: The visualization of the 3D data, in order to indicate the direct consequences of e.g. an os-teotomy by visualization of the patient's new profile <ref> [11] </ref>, is an extremely useful tool. But besides that, it is also very important for a surgeon to get an impression of the functional changes and effects of an operation to the patients anatomy.

Reference-contexts: Results and evaluations are presented in chapter 6. 2. State of the art Due to its importance, the temporomandibular joint has been an area of active research in dentistry for many years. The main reason for this is the strong influence of this joint on the occlusion <ref> [12] </ref>. An optimal occlusion is the goal of any dental therapy. Dysfunctions in the area of the TMJ entail a disorder of the occlusion like the supernatural wear, loosening of the teeth, and severe pain disorders. Whenever joint motions are simulated, kinematic models have to be established [9]. <p> Additionally they are not transferable into a computer based simulation. To get a better view on the occlusion, physicians use articulators. In these mechanical devices plaster-casts of the teeth are fixed. By adjusting the hinge axis position, the inclination of the trajectory of the condylus, and the Bennett angle <ref> [12] </ref> the individual geometric parameters of the patient are identified. Articulators are used to show a view of the occlusion and the initial opening and closing movement. <p> We therefore had to identify the rotation axes for the three basic movements. A rotation axis for the opening position is intuitively the hinge axis. It is located between the two condyls and can be determined by measurements, as described in <ref> [12] </ref>. The protrusion or the path of the condyls can be described as a segment of a circle. This approximation is known from studies in dentistry ([1], [13]) and is caused by the almost circular structure of the Os temporale.

This approximation is known from studies in dentistry ([1], <ref> [13] </ref>) and is caused by the almost circular structure of the Os temporale.

Reference-contexts: This is a complex task as the combination of the mastication muscles is very filigree. The only known work to the authors is the 2D simulation of the jaw by the Motor Control Lab in Montreal <ref> [14] </ref>. In this kind of application the above explained passive method can help to get a better impression on this combined movement and to get initial values for the length and velocity of the movement.

Reference-contexts: At the upper bound, only a protrusion takes place. If the maximal frontal position is reached, the condyls are located under the tuberculum articulare. Finally, the jaw is gliding back into its resting position <ref> [19] </ref>. This is the border movement the incisal point can perform, projected on a sagittal plane. The path of the fourth segment is affected by the structure of the teeth, and the other paths by the muscles and ligaments. 3.2.

Reference-contexts: They can only give a better view on measured data. A research group at the Waseda University in Japan has been working for several years on a chewing robot <ref> [21] </ref>. The third version of this robot (WJ-3) consists of a skull model which is moved by motors and wires. Its kinematic is fixed and given through the mechanical assembly and the muscle functions are modeled by artificial muscle actuators (AMA). <p> Mandible movement The movement of the mandible is usually described by the incisal point which is located between the two lower incisors. During a mastication cycle, this point performs a loop starting at the intercuspidal position <ref> [21] </ref>. The maximal area including all the points the incisal point can reach, is described by the Posselt figure. The Posselt figure is the convex hull of all these points and displays the position of the incisal point for the extreme constellations of the joint.

The static images from different points of view and automatic segmentation of different kinds of tissue <ref> [24] </ref> provides the surgeon with a direct view on the anatomy and pathology. The visualization of the 3D data, in order to indicate the direct consequences of e.g. an os-teotomy by visualization of the patient's new profile [11], is an extremely useful tool. <p> In the first step, the user specifies the individual parameters of a patient in the modeler application. He can adapt a default data set which has been segmented from a CT (Computer Tomograph) image <ref> [24] </ref>. The adaption is done by matching the default data set with landmarks of a patient using the least-squares approximation. Furthermore, the specific data set of the patient can be segmented and used. After conversion into a triangular surface data set, they can be visualized.

It is assumed, that the maxilla is fixed, so only the movement of the mandible is respected.
