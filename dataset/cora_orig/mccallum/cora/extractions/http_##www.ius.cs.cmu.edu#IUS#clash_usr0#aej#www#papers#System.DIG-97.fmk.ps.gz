Abstract: We present a perception system, called Artisan, that semi-automatically builds 3-D models of a robots workspace. Range images are acquired with a scanning laser rangefinder and then processed, based on a systematic sensor characterization, to remove noise and artifacts. Complex 3-D objects represented as surface meshes are subsequently recognized in the range images and inserted into a virtual workspace. This graphical virtual workspace is then used to by human operators to plan and execute remote robotic operations.

Reference-contexts: This paradigm, known as task space scene analysis, provides a much richer understanding of complex, interior work environments than that gleaned from conventional 2-D camera images, allowing an operator to view the work space from inaccessible angles and also to plan and simulate robotic actions within the virtual world model <ref> [1] </ref> [6]. Through object recognition, Artisan assigns semantic meaning to objects in the scene, facilitating execution of robotic commands, drastically simplifying operator interaction and setting the stage for automatic task execution. World modeling with Artisan proceeds as follows.

Reference-contexts: From these sets of correspondences, plausible rigid transformations are calculated; these transformations align the model (s) with the scene data. The plausible transformations are verified and refined with a modified iterative closest point algorithm <ref> [2] </ref>. The verification algorithm iteratively spreads point correspondences from those already established by spin-image comparisons over the surface of the model and the scene. At each iteration, it recalculates the transformation from model to scene.

Reference-contexts: To solve this problem we use a mesh simplification algorithm that normalizes the lengths of edges in a mesh while preserving the shape of the object represented <ref> [3] </ref>. The end result is a surface mesh representation of appropriate resolution that has an even distribution of points over the surface and from which our recognition representation can be made. 4.

Reference-contexts: Modeling from range images proceeds as follows: With a rangefinder, a complete model of the object is imaged from many different viewpoints. The multiple surface mesh views are then registered to find the correct location of the data sets in a single world coordinate frame <ref> [4] </ref>. Fortunately, the matching techniques used in our recognition system are also useful when registering multiple views of an object. <p> Every oriented point on an object has an associated spin-image that describes the shape of the object with respect to the oriented point; the procedure for spin-image generation for surface registration is detailed in <ref> [4] </ref>. Not surprisingly, spin-images used for surface registration can also be used for object recognition. A spin image for an oriented point on a surface mesh is created as follows.

The ability to generate models of objects from range images has some useful consequences when modeling scenes with unexpected or unknown objects.

World modeling with Artisan proceeds as follows. <p> Our approach is general in that, by working directly with surface meshes, it does not make assumptions of the shape of the objects that can be recognized. Our earlier system <ref> [6] </ref> restricted recognition to objects mostly composed of planar and quadric surfaces. This constraint relegated Artisan to use in environments comprised only of objects with simple geometries, such as cylinders and boxes.

Reference-contexts: If the operator chooses, the amount of scene data to be processed can be reduced by sub-sampling the range image during mesh creation. Sub-sampling is appropriate when recognizing large objects without large amounts of surface detail. Previous work with the Perceptron laser rangefinder <ref> [7] </ref> has noted problems with laser scanning technology with regard to intrinsic scanner characteristics, surface material properties and surface incidence angle.

Reference-contexts: Since these patches generally do not contribute to recognition, they are eliminated from the mesh to reduce the amount of scene processing for recognition. The final step in scene data processing is the application of a low-pass filter to the mesh <ref> [10] </ref>. This filter smooths without shrinking, so it removes spurious noise from the mesh while still preserving the shape of objects.

Reference-contexts: First, the approach does not make any assumptions on the sensor used for acquiring the range data. In fact, we have demonstrated the system both with an imaging laser rangefinder and with a light stripe rangefinder. In contrast, systems based on interactive stereo <ref> [11] </ref> or line segmentation make strong assumptions on the geometry of the sensor and do not generalize nearly as well as does the point matching algorithm at the heart of Artisan.
