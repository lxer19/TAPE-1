Abstract: WWW users want fast and easy access to all documents available on the net. Thus, Web server performance is becoming increasingly important. The perceived Web latency i.e., the request response time, is affected by the performance of three components: the client, the server and the network that connects clients and servers. The client delay is the time required by the browser to show the document, considering the different types of media, such as audio, video, text, and graphics. The network latency represents the time required to provide the remote access plus the data transmission time. The server delay is the time required by the server to service the request. In this paper we focus on the anal ysis and modeling of the server performance.

Reference-contexts: Performance Monitor <ref> [1] </ref> is a graphical tool based on a series of counters that represent performance measures. It allows a user to study the behavior of resources such as processors, memory, logical disks, processes and network interface and identifies the resources as objects. A unique set of counters exists for each object.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The World-Wide Web (WWW or Web) is a client-server system that integrates various types of information on the global Internet and on enterprise Internet Protocol (IP) networks <ref> [3] </ref>. It defines a global naming convention for all documents that are part of the Web. It allows users to navigate sites all around the world. The growth in popularity of the Web has been enormous. It is the fastest growing segment on the Internet. <p> A NT process consists of an executable program, a set of virtual memory addresses and at least one thread, which is an executable entity that belongs to one process <ref> [3] </ref>. Two or more threads can be created to execute within a single process, sharing the same address space and other resources, improving the performance. Multithreading processes have been used as an ideal solution to implement server application in a client/server environment.

Reference-contexts: The Web server software is the EMWAC HTTPs, that originates from the European Microsoft Windows NT Academic Centre <ref> [5] </ref>. It is designed for computers running the Windows NT operating system and it implements the HTTP/1.0 protocol. It runs as a "service" and is called https. The server platform was connected by a non-dedicated Ethernet network to a Unix machine where the WebStone runs.

Reference-contexts: Benchmarking has been regarded as a useful approach for analyzing and predicting performance of computer systems. Several benchmarks have been proposed to measure hardware and software speed, including compilers and operating systems. The most often cited are SPEC, TPC, and Linpack <ref> [6] </ref>. WWW servers process specific workloads, composed mostly of HTTP requests. Thus, new benchmarks are needed to understand the server performance. WebStone is a configurable client-server benchmark for HTTP servers [7]. <p> A request for a page represents a request for each one of its files. The WebStone primary results are throughput measured in Bytes/second and latency, which is the average response time to complete a request. Other measures are connection rate averages and Little's Load Factor, derived from Little's law <ref> [6] </ref>. The last one reflects how much time is spent by the server on request processing, not including errors and overhead. It is a measure of the effective utilization of the server. Ideally, Little's Load Factor should always be equal to the number of the client processes. <p> The operating system overheads will be implicitly represented in that class. The server is represented by a closed model, with the multiprogramming level equals to the number of connections in execution. A single-class closed model can be easily solved by the MVA (mean value analysis) equations <ref> [6] </ref>. The basic input parameters for a queuing model are the service demands, which represent the average total service time that an HTTP request spends at the processor and disks. The service demand at device i is given by the following expression from reference [6]: D i = T =C fi <p> the MVA (mean value analysis) equations <ref> [6] </ref>. The basic input parameters for a queuing model are the service demands, which represent the average total service time that an HTTP request spends at the processor and disks. The service demand at device i is given by the following expression from reference [6]: D i = T =C fi U global (1) where D i is the processor demand, T is the observation period, C is the total number of HTTP requests completed in T (given by the Webstone statistics), and U global is the processor utilization registered by the counters of Performance

Thus, new benchmarks are needed to understand the server performance. WebStone is a configurable client-server benchmark for HTTP servers <ref> [7] </ref>. It uses workload parameters and clients to generate HTTP traffic that allows an HTTP server to be stressed in a number of different ways. <p> This can give insight into the server behavior. 2.1 The WebStone Benchmark WebStone makes a number of HTTP 1.0 GET requests for specific pages on a Web server and measures the performance of the server software and hardware platform set. WebStone is a distributed, multi-process benchmark <ref> [7] </ref>. The master process (WebMASTER) remotely spawns a number of clients to generate HTTP traffic based on the workload parameters specified in the configuration files. After all clients have been initialized, the benchmark is executed.
