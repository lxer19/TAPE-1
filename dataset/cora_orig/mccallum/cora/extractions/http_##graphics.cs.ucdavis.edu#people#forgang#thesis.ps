Reference-contexts: There are two basic approaches for volume rendering: image-order and object-order. In an image-order volume technique, ray casting, rays are cast from each pixel in the image plane through the volume to determine the resulting pixel value <ref> [19, 2] </ref>. In an object-order technique, splatting [22], the volume data (voxels) are projected onto the image plane. 4.7.1 Ray Casting In this image-order technique, it is determined how the data samples affect each pixel in the image plane.

Reference-contexts: Some locations along the probes were outside the bounds of the grid due to deep holes in the bay that were smoothed out in the model. Furthermore, it was required that the Chesapeake Bay model be visualized using SCIRT (Site Characterization Interactive Research Toolkit) <ref> [3] </ref>, a tool developed at the NSF Engineering Research Center for Computational Field Simulation at Mississippi State University. 2 However, the model had values associated with curvilinear cells whereas SCIRT expected data associated with rectilinear points. <p> The rectangles are sorted by distance from the viewpoint and then displayed CHAPTER 4. VOLUME VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES 12 from back to front using an ff-buffer [11]. Once again, interactive rotation allows the user different viewpoints. 4.4 Point Clouds Point Clouds <ref> [3] </ref> is a domain decomposition method that is only slightly different from the Minicubes technique. This technique generates the minicubes in the same fashion as above, but rather than connecting the minicubes' vertices into quadrilateral faces, it simply renders the vertex points.

Reference-contexts: However, it is sometimes easy to determine how coarse the representation is due to the shading. Another method has been explored that uses quadratic Bezier triangles, rather than regular triangles, in order to create a smooth, quadric surface <ref> [6] </ref>. Although this method is still C 0 -continuous, it is visibly smoother. If the Bezier triangles were to be elevated to a higher degree, a C 1 - continuous surface could be made, but generally such a method is computationally very expensive. CHAPTER 4.

Reference-contexts: To do so requires a more strenuous test. It can be unambiguously determined if a point is inside a cell by using computational space rather than physical space <ref> [7] </ref>; this can be done by using an estimate of the Jacobian and the Bernstein-Bezier polynomials. The mathematics behind this is briefly discussed below. Jacobian of a Cell The Jacobian can be used to transform points and vectors from computational space to physical space and vice versa [7]. <p> than physical space <ref> [7] </ref>; this can be done by using an estimate of the Jacobian and the Bernstein-Bezier polynomials. The mathematics behind this is briefly discussed below. Jacobian of a Cell The Jacobian can be used to transform points and vectors from computational space to physical space and vice versa [7]. A point in a unit grid cell in computational space has local parameter values u, v, and w with respect to this cell. <p> If D's magnitude is 0 (or within some tolerance), then the parameters are accepted. If all parameters are in the range [0,1], then the point is inside the cell <ref> [7] </ref>. Determining Local Parameters Once a cell that P ij might lie in has been found, the (transpose) Jacobian ~ J is calculated using the central differencing scheme and then its inverse ~ J 1 is calculated and the cell's vertices are stored.

Reference-contexts: The greyscale color map is especially useful since it is continuous if the user wishes a smooth picture and does not require a color printer. Color can easily be defined as a three tuple, either HSV <ref> [8] </ref> or RGB. HSV stands for hue, saturation, and value. Hue is the shade of the color and can be measured as an angle on the color wheel (see Figure 3.1). <p> Color can also be used as a contextual cue <ref> [8] </ref>. For instance, a blue color map might be CHAPTER 3. COLOR MAPS AND CONTEXTUAL CUES 8 used to represent ocean depth data. A color map ranging from blue to red could be used for temperature data that ranges from cold to hot.

Reference-contexts: A ray is cast from the camera view point through a selected pixel in the image plane into the volume; see Figure 4.6a. The ray is sampled at discrete points separated by a distance d. At each point within the volume, using a back-to-front ordering, color is calculated as <ref> [9] </ref>: CHAPTER 4.

Reference-contexts: Otherwise, it contributes a triangle or quadrilateral to the isosurface, as shown in Figure 4.3. If the data is located on a rectilinear grid, then there are simplifications that can be made as described in the "marching cubes" method <ref> [10] </ref>. Since there are eight vertices, there are, in principle, 2 8 = 256 possible configurations, depending on whether a vertex is above or below the isovalue. These possibilities can be divided in half when considering the CHAPTER 4.

Reference-contexts: that data is associated with a point and that the data set is usually a structured grid, which simplifies the algorithms. 4.1 Cutting Planes A cutting plane is a two-dimensional rectangular grid data set "obtained by taking a slice through the domain by holding one of the independent variables constant" <ref> [11] </ref>. For volumetric data, three cutting planes can be shown, one for each direction. <p> CHAPTER 4. VOLUME VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES 11 An offset surface is a special case of a carpet plot, where the surface is a plane. The same technique could be used to show data on an arbitrary (curved) surface. This technique is also useful for showing surface-on-surface data <ref> [11] </ref>. 4.3 Minicubes and Vanishing Cubes Minicubes, or "tiny cubes," [14] is a domain decomposition method. It reduces the domain into smaller portions so that the user can get a better idea of the data inside the volume. <p> Using the color map, the function value's color is determined and then each face of the cube is Gouraud shaded. Interactive rotation allows the user to obtain different views, and thus see different faces of the minicubes. The vanishing cubes method <ref> [11] </ref> is very similar to the Minicubes method. The same positions of the cubes' vertices are calculated and shaded. However, only the faces that face the user are shown, for a total of 3N x N y N z rectangles to be displayed. <p> Furthermore, in order to "see in," an image based upon a simple model of transparency is computed for the rectangles. The rectangles are sorted by distance from the viewpoint and then displayed CHAPTER 4. VOLUME VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES 12 from back to front using an ff-buffer <ref> [11] </ref>. Once again, interactive rotation allows the user different viewpoints. 4.4 Point Clouds Point Clouds [3] is a domain decomposition method that is only slightly different from the Minicubes technique. <p> If interactive rotation is available, it is much easier to rotate the data in order to see all points. CHAPTER 4. VOLUME VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES 13 4.5 Contours/Isosurfaces Contour plots <ref> [11] </ref> for bivariate data are widely used. Terrain models from elevation data are often displayed with contour maps. Choropleths (color-coded contour graphs) are used in connection with weather reports to show the distribution of temperature over a particular region. <p> For a bivariate model, F (x; y), a contour line is defined as C a = f (x; y) : F (x; y) = ag. Similarly, for a trivariate model, F (x; y; z), an isosurface <ref> [11] </ref> is defined as S a = f (x; y; z) : F (x; y; z) = ag. The computation of the isosurface depends on the type of data set. <p> This problem was addressed and solved in [15]. Another solution is to separate the cube into five or six tetrahedra. (There are two ways to subdivide into five tetrahedra; in order to retain C 0 continuity, the two decompositions have to be alternated from one voxel to the next <ref> [11] </ref>.) This method does not encounter the same problem discussed above at the expense of introducing more computation and, usually, more triangles that make up the isosurface.

Reference-contexts: For instance, the data set may be a uniform-rectilinear grid in the xy plane and be a rectilinear grid in the xz plane (and thus yz plane). Such is the case of one of the data sets supported in the implementation. Another hybrid is commonly called "Well Log data" <ref> [12] </ref>. In this case, the xy plane has a scattered data set but the z axis has a rectilinear grid orientation. In other words, for a given (x; y) position, there is a list of z values that contain data. <p> Since the probe data is collected by a different agency, there is no correspondence between the times at which the model outputs are evaluated and when the probes are measured. 6.1 Probe Data set The probe data is similar to the format of the "Well Log Data" <ref> [12] </ref> data set type; however, each probe also has a discrete time value associated with it.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, which pixels that are affected by each data sample must be determined, requiring an ordered compositing. Two different ordering schemes can be used: CHAPTER 4. VOLUME VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES 18 back-to-front order, which was discussed above, and front-to-back order <ref> [13] </ref>. A front-to-back order provides advantages in some cases, similar to the ray-casting method. If compositing opaque samples, the compositing process can be stopped once such a voxel has been mapped to a pixel, because any voxel mapped to the same pixel will be occluded by the first pixel.

Reference-contexts: The same technique could be used to show data on an arbitrary (curved) surface.

Reference-contexts: This number can further be reduced to fifteen distinct configurations by forming equivalence classes based upon rotations; Figure 4.4 shows four of the fifteen classes. However, there is a flaw in the "marching cubes" algorithm which results in holes. This problem was addressed and solved in <ref> [15] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is argued in <ref> [16] </ref> that this is a bad idea since the characteristics of the original data set are lost and that interpolation is not always rigorous because of the physical heterogeneities of the domain. <p> Second, and more importantly, the algorithm depends on interpolation which has been argued to be undesirable. Therefore, like minicubes, a much simpler methodology was developed. The data isolation feature is used to show "isocells" <ref> [16] </ref>, or cells that have the same function value, V a = C i;j;k : F (C i;j;k ) = a. The user specifies the function value (or range of function values) which are of interest.

Reference-contexts: Since it may be helpful to know how many points contributed to the weighted average of a cell, this number should be indicated. Since color is used to represent the value of the weighted average, another paradigm must be used. Polygonal representations called icons <ref> [17] </ref> are used to represent this number of probe points in a cell, using both shape and size to do so. Flat-shaded hexahedra, in the shape of the cell itself (much like the Minicubes technique), are used to represent cells which have one to five probe points in them.

Reference-contexts: Otherwise, other cells are tested until the cell is found or no cell is found, in which case a 0 is recorded. Alternatively, the Newton-Raphson method <ref> [18] </ref> could have been used to calculate a more precise Jacobian. However, only an estimate was necessary and the Newton-Raphson method would have required unnecessary calculations. 6.4 Probe-Oriented Rendering Techniques An object-oriented approach is taken to visualize the observed data.

Reference-contexts: There are two basic approaches for volume rendering: image-order and object-order. In an image-order volume technique, ray casting, rays are cast from each pixel in the image plane through the volume to determine the resulting pixel value <ref> [19, 2] </ref>. In an object-order technique, splatting [22], the volume data (voxels) are projected onto the image plane. 4.7.1 Ray Casting In this image-order technique, it is determined how the data samples affect each pixel in the image plane.

Reference-contexts: However, the algorithm is much more complex in that it must be determined where in relation to the points the cutting plane lies, and the values of the points on the plane must be trilinearly interpolated from the data set. 4.2 Carpet Plots and Offset Surfaces A carpet plot <ref> [20] </ref> is created by warping a 2D surface in the direction of the surface normal (or possibly some user defined direction). <p> If the Bezier triangles were to be elevated to a higher degree, a C 1 - continuous surface could be made, but generally such a method is computationally very expensive. CHAPTER 4. VOLUME VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES 15 4.6 Dividing Cubes Dividing cubes <ref> [20] </ref> is a contouring algorithm similar to marching cubes. Instead of generating lines (2D) or surfaces (3D), dividing cubes generates point primitives. <p> Volume rendering is a technique that renders the 3D data sets directly and allows the user to "see inside" or "see through" the data <ref> [20] </ref>. Volume rendering is inherently different from surface rendering because the interior structure of the 3D data is viewed. In order to do so, transfer functions include translucent alpha values which allows the user to blend or composite data from the 3D object onto a 2D image plane.

Reference-contexts: The splatting method uses feed-forward convolution to distribute energy from input samples onto the image plane [22]. An image-plane footprint for each data sample is calculated and is used to spread the sample's energy onto the image plane <ref> [21] </ref>. Typically, a spherical Gaussian kernel projected onto a plane perpendicular to the view direction is used. The footprint is evaluated on a grid as shown in Figure 4.7. The extent of the footprint and its resolution is specified by the user.
