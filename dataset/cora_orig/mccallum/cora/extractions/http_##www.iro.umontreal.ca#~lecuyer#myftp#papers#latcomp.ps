Title: LATTICE COMPUTATIONS FOR RANDOM NUMBERS  
Author: RAYMOND COUTURE AND PIERRE L'ECUYER 
Abstract: We improve on a lattice algorithm of Tezuka for the computation of the k-distribution of a class of random number generators based on finite fields. We show how this is applied to the problem of constructing, for such generators, an output mapping yielding optimal k-distribution.

Reference-contexts: We give a typical illustration. We take F to be the field of degree 19937 over F 2 , and x 2 F to be a root of P ch (X) = X 19937 + X 9842 + 1. This trinomial is primitive (see the table in <ref> [3] </ref>). Let w = 32 and E = (F nf0g) w . We seek to determine a regular path in T (E), recursively.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1. The rank of (1) is equal to lk i=1 l )) + ; 0 k d:(9) Proof. This follows from (5) and Lemma 2. 2 The quantities oe i (fl 0 l ) can be computed by applying the Lenstra reduction al gorithm <ref> [5] </ref> to a suitably chosen basis of fl 0 l . We digress shortly to establish a remarkable connection between the quantities oe i (fl l ), and oe i (fl 0 l ). This is closely connected to a result of Mahler (see x10 of [6]). <p> Recursivity From theorem 1 and its corollary, the rank of (1) can be obtained, simultaneously for all k, by computation of the quantities oe i (fl l ), or oe i (fl 0 l ). This is achieved by use of Lenstra's reduction algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>, applied to a suitable basis of fl l or fl 0 l and, as we shall now show, it is advantageous for this to use the latter lattice rather than the former. Assume 1 &lt; l w. <p> The storage requirement for the algorithm is then measured by ld s (B), and an upper bound for the execution time (the required number of bit operations) is given by Cl 3 d m (B)(d s (B) lg jflj + 1);(12) for some absolute constant C (see prop. 1.14 of <ref> [5] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: We digress shortly to establish a remarkable connection between the quantities oe i (fl l ), and oe i (fl 0 l ). This is closely connected to a result of Mahler (see x10 of <ref> [6] </ref>). We first establish the following relation. Proposition 1. dim F 2 (V (l) " F l k ) = d lk; 1 k d:(10) Proof.

Reference-contexts: The efficiency issue becomes critical if the order d of the generator is chosen large. One such method is proposed by Tezuka <ref> [7] </ref>. He computes the rank of (1), for a given value of l and all k, by means of an l-dimensional lattice fl l in the space F 2 [X] l of l-tuples of polynomials with F 2 coefficients. <p> For instance Tezuka's lattice fl l is equal to fl V (l) with V (l) = F (y 1 ; : : : ; y l ) (see def. 3 of <ref> [7] </ref>), and its fundamental volume is thus equal to 2 d (l1) .
