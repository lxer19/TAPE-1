Abstract: In image processing applications, the storage capacity required for images can exceed feasible storage capabilities. A technique to alleviate this problem by removal of unnecessary background information through image processing is discussed. Specifically, a parallel implementation of a first-order, derivative-based edge detection algorithm and the Hough transform applied to rectangular objects is given. A variation of the classical Hough transform to detect lines is employed to locate rectangular objects of known size in an image. Parallel Virtual Machine is used to exploit the inherent parallelism found in these algorithms over a cluster of 7 workstations. Through the use of these techniques, the rectangular object is detected and stored as a separate image, and storage capacity can be reduced by approximately 30%, not including standard data compression. Parallelizing the algorithms provides a significant speedup advantage over the normal sequential operation of the programs.

Reference-contexts: The gradient and magnitude in the digital domain are obtained by convolving the image with two masks in the x and y directions. Some common masks used for gradient edge detection are the Sobel, Prewitt, and Roberts Cross <ref> [1] </ref>. For this study, the Sobel masks, illustrated in Figure 1 , were chosen because of their smoothing and differencing effects. The second-order derivative, or Laplacian, of a 2-D image has a zero-crossing at the midpoint in any intensity change and, unlike the first-derivative detection, indicates the direction of change.

Reference-contexts: The principles that PVM is based upon include a user-configured host pool, translucent access to hardware, process-based computation, explicit message-passing model, heterogeneity support, and multiprocessor support. A parallel version of an optimized sequential program can be created by incorporating the PVM constructs into the sequential program <ref> [2] </ref>. RESULTS The largest test image was of a package of size 742 x 513 pixels illustrated in Figure 5 . The packages were captured in 24-bit color using a scanner and converted to grayscale for the edge detection.

Reference-contexts: V. C. Hough <ref> [4] </ref>. By performing calculations on the pixels, a parameter space consisting of accumulator cells, usually initialized to zero, is created and filled according to the points which satisfy the equations describing the desired shape.

Reference-contexts: Second, a threshold operation is applied in which points contributing to edges are identified as those exceeding a set level of intensity gradient values. Third, the edge points are combined into coherent edges by applying a linking algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. The fundamental concept in most edgedetection techniques is the computation of the local derivative operator which is designed to estimate spatial gradient that in turn identifies the edges.
