Title: Simple Profiling System for SUIF  
Author: Tim Callahan and John Wawrzynek 
Affiliation: Computer Science Division University of California, Berkeley  
Abstract-found: 0
Intro-found: 1
Reference: [1] <author> Todd Mowry and Robert Ho. </author> <title> "Feedback and Simulation Tools for Investigating Do-Across Parallelism", First SUIF Compiler Workshop, </title> <institution> Stanford University, </institution> <month> January 11-13, </month> <year> 1996. </year> <month> 5 </month>
Reference-contexts: No data from the execution stream, such as load/store addresses, are available. If tcovsuif doesn't do everything you want, you may want to inquire about the memprof profiling tools <ref> [1] </ref> developed by Todd Mowry's group. They are based on pixie and xsim. 2 How it works Most of the work in this profiling system is done by the Makefile; tcovsuif is only the final step.
