Reference-contexts: Fix a positive *, and let K = K c n be an edge colored complete graph on n = 2m vertices satisfying (1). We first prove the following simple lemma (similar results are proved in various places, see, e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>). Lemma 2.1 For all sufficiently large m, K contains a spanning edge colored complete bipartite graph K c m;m satisfying (K c 1 2 * )m: (2) Proof.

Reference-contexts: This can be bounded by the well known inequality of Chernoff (cf., e.g., <ref> [2] </ref>, Theorem A.4, page 235) by 2 e 2s 2 =q &lt; e 2s 2 =m : Since the same argument applies to the number of red neighbors of w in B, and since there are less than 8m 3 choices for a vertex w, a color in the given coloring <p> To prove the second assertion in the lemma we apply a martingale inequality of Azuma (cf., e.g., <ref> [2] </ref>, Chapter 7). Let u 1 ; u 2 ; : : : ; u l be all elements of U (jU j = l m 1). <p> Moreover, if f; f 0 : U 7! M differ only on k members of U then jB (f ) B (f 0 )j k. Therefore, using the technique in [9], pp. 33-35 or in <ref> [2] </ref>, pp. 89-92 one can prove that for each i; 0 i l 1, jX i+1 (g) X i (g)j 2. Here are the details.

Reference-contexts: The detailed proof appears in the next section. The final section contains some related remarks and extensions to cycles of other lengths. For additional information on properly colored paths and cycles we refer the reader to the survey paper <ref> [3] </ref>. 2 The Proof In this section we prove Theorem 1.1. For simplicity we assume first that n = 2m is even, and remark at the end of the section how to modify the argument for the case of odd n.

Reference-contexts: A properly colored cycle in G c , that is, a cycle in which adjacent edges have distinct colors is called an alternating cycle. In particular, an alternating Hamilton cycle is a properly colored Hamilton cycle in G c . Bollobas and Erd-os <ref> [6] </ref> proved that if (K c n ) &lt; n=69 then K c n contains an alternating Hamilton cycle. <p> This was improved by Chen and Daykin [8] and Shearer [10] who proved that the same conclusion holds under the weaker assumptions (K c n ) n=17 and (K c n ) &lt; n=7, respectively. The authors of <ref> [6] </ref> conjectured that in fact it is enough to assume that (K c n ) &lt; bn=2c which, if true, would be best possible. In this note we prove the following theorem, which improves the estimate of [10], but still falls short of establishing the above mentioned conjecture. <p> The authors of <ref> [6] </ref> show that if (K c n ) &lt; n=69 then, in fact, K c n contains alternating cycles of all lengths from 3 to n. Similarly, in [8] the same conclusion is shown to follow from the weaker assumption (K c n ) n=17. <p> Finally, it would be interesting to decide if the conjecture of <ref> [6] </ref> that asserts that if (K c n ) &lt; bn=2c then K c n contains an alternating Hamilton cycle is correct.

Theorem 2.4 (Nash-Williams) Any directed graph on m vertices in which every indegree and every outdegree is at least m=2 contains a directed Hamilton cycle. <p> The proof is very similar to the proof of Theorem 1.1, but instead of Theorem 2.4 we need the following result, which is very similar to a result of Haggkvist and Thomassen (cf., e.g., <ref> [7] </ref>) and may be known. Since we were unable to find a reference we include a simple proof. Lemma 3.3 Any directed graph D on m vertices in which every indegree and every outdegree is at least m=2 + 1 is vertex pancyclic.

This completes the proof of the theorem. 2 3 Concluding remarks, extensions and problems 1. Chen and Daykin <ref> [8] </ref> proved that if K c m;m is an edge colored complete bipartite graph with partite sets of cardinality m each and (K c m;m ) m=25 then K c m;m contains an alternating Hamilton cycle. <p> The authors of [6] show that if (K c n ) &lt; n=69 then, in fact, K c n contains alternating cycles of all lengths from 3 to n. Similarly, in <ref> [8] </ref> the same conclusion is shown to follow from the weaker assumption (K c n ) n=17.
