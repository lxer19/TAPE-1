Abstract: This paper deals with simultaneous global external as well as global internal stabilization of linear systems with saturating actuators. The paper proposes a new family of scheduled low-and-high gain state feedback laws that yields a closed-loop system which is both globally onite gain L p stable and globally asymptotically stable. Moreover, the controller has an explicit design parameter that can be adjusted to make the L p gain of the closed-loop system arbitrarily small.

Reference-contexts: Several types of studies on stabilization of such systems have already been done. These include, global, semi-global internal or external stabilization, e.g. <ref> [1, 14, 17, 1922] </ref>. Our concern in the paper is with the problems that arise where external as well as internal stabilization is required. Such problems are labeled as simultaneous stabilization problems [14]. <p> Before starting our problem formulations, we recall following classical deonitions of external (input-output) stability. Deonition 2.2 (Global L p stability) Given any p 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, the continuous-time system is said to be globally L p -stable if given any d 2 L s p and x (0) = 0, we have y 2 L p p . Deonition 2.3 (Global onite gain L p stability) Given any p 2 [1; 1], the continuous-time system <p> Given any p 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, the continuous-time system is said to be globally L p -stable if given any d 2 L s p and x (0) = 0, we have y 2 L p p . Deonition 2.3 (Global onite gain L p stability) Given any p 2 [1; 1], the continuous-time system is said to be globally onite gain L p -stable if it is globally L p -stable, and in addition if there exists a positive constant fl p such that with x (0) = 0 the following holds: kyk L p fl p kdk L p <p> Now we state the following simultaneous stabilization problems which are the focuses of our paper. Problem 1 (Simultaneous global onite gain L p -stabilization and global asymptotic stabilization via static state feedback) For any p 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, the system is said to be simultaneously globally onite gain L p -stabilizable and globally asymptotically stabilizable via static state feedback if there exists a static state feedback law, such that the following conditions hold: (i ) The closed-loop system is onite gain L p -stable; (ii ) In <p> Problem 2 (Simultaneous global L p -stabilization and global asymptotic stabilization via static state feedback). For any p 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, the system is said to be simultaneously globally L p -stabilizable and globally asymptotically stabilizable via static state feedback if there exists a static state feedback law, such that the following conditions hold: (i ) The closed-loop system is L p -stable; 4 (ii ) In the absence of <p> We next brief the lemma and its properties we will use in this paper. Lemma 3.1 Let Q : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! R n fi n be a continuously dioeerentiable matrix-valued function such that Q (0) = 0, dQ (") d" &gt; 0 for any " 2 (0; 1]. Also let Assumption 2.4 be satisoed. <p> Therefore for " s 2 <ref> [" fl s ; 1] </ref>, there exist ff = ff (" fl s ) and fi = fi (" fl s ) such that dV 6 ffV + fiV 2 kdk: (4.19) Then, by using the standard comparison theorem, we can prove that the closed-loop system is L p -stable.

Reference-contexts: A major classiocation for both internal and external stability requirement is whether they are required in global, semi-global or local sense. There are other classiocations that relate to the requirements on external stability of the closed-loop system <ref> [3] </ref>. Various simultaneous stabilization problems for linear systems with saturating actuator have been studied in the literature ( see for example [2,3,7,14,15,1720]). <p> However, the simultaneous stabilization problem that requires global asymptotic stability as well as global L p stability with onite gain of the closed-loop systems, which has been acronymized in <ref> [3] </ref> as the (G p =G) fg problem, remained as an open and challenging problem. A signiocant attempt in dealing with stabilization problem in global framework is the work of Megretski [19]. Megretski solves the simultaneous L 2 -semi-global onite gain stabilization and global asymptotic stabilization problem.
