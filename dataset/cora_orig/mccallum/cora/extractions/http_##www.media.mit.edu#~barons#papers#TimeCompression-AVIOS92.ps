Reference-contexts: In another study, it was found that inter-phrase pauses were longer and occurred less frequently than intra-phrase pauses (data from several articles summarized in <ref> [Agn74] </ref>). Hesitation pauses are not under the conscious control of the talker, and average 200-250ms. Juncture pauses are under talker control, and average 500-1000ms. Several studies have shown that breath stops in oral reading are about 400ms.

Reference-contexts: The simplest methods involve the use of energy or average magnitude measurements combined with time thresholds; other metrics include zero-crossing rate measurements, LPC parameters, etc. A variety of speech/silence detection techniques are reviewed in detail in <ref> [Aro92] </ref>. Maxemchuk [Max80] used 62.5ms frames of speech corresponding to disk blocks (512 bytes of 8kHz, 8-bit - law data). For computational efficiency, only a pseudorandom sample of 32 out of every 512 values were looked at to determine low energy portions of the signal.

Reference-contexts: When speaking fast, a talker unintentionally changes relative attributes of his speech such as pause durations, consonant-vowel duration, etc. Talkers can only compress their speech to about 70% because of physiological limitations 3 <ref> [BM76] </ref>. 5.2 Speed Changing Speed changing is analogous to playing a tape recorder at a faster (or slower) speed. This method can be replicated digitally by changing the sampling rate during the playback of a sound. <p> Much of this research has been summarized in <ref> [BM76] </ref>, [FS69], and [Fou71]. 9.1 Intelligibility vs. Comprehension Intelligibility usually refers to the ability to identify isolated words. Depending on the type of experiment, such words may either be selected from a closed set, or written down (or shadowed) by the subject from an open-ended set. <p> A dichotic discard interval of 40-50ms was found to have the highest intelligibility (40ms was described as the optimum interval in another study [Ger74]. Earlier studies suggest that a shorter interval of 18-25ms may be better for diotic speech <ref> [BM76] </ref>). Gerber showed that 50% compression presented diotically was significantly better than 25% compression presented dichotically, even though the information quantity of the presentations was the same. These and other data provide conclusive evidence that 25% compression is too fast for the information to be processed by the auditory system. <p> Beasley reports on an informal basis that following a 30 minute or so exposure to compressed speech, listeners become uncomfortable if they are forced to return to the normal rate of presentation <ref> [BM76] </ref>. <p> The techniques described in this paper can thus aid in user acceptance of voice applications. A Note on Important References Though dated, the most readily accessible, and most often cited, reference is [FS69]. Another broad and more recent summary is <ref> [BM76] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: David and Mc-Donald demonstrated a bandwidth reduction technique in 1956 that selectively removed (redundant) pitch periods from speech signals <ref> [DM56] </ref>. Scott applied the same ideas to time compression, setting the sampling and discard intervals to be synchronous with the pitch periods of the speech. Discontinuities in the time compressed signal were reduced, and intelligibility increased [SG72].

Reference-contexts: Malah describes time-domain harmonic scaling which requires pitch estimation, is pitch synchronous, and can only accommodate certain compression ratios [Mal79, Lim83]. 7.2 Phase Vocoding A vocoder that maintains phase <ref> [Dol86] </ref> can be used for time-compression. A phase vocoder can be interpreted as a filterbank and thus is similar to the harmonic compressor. A phase vocoder is, however, significantly more complex because calculations are done in the frequency domain, and the phase of the original signal must be reconstructed.

Reference-contexts: It is now practical to integrate speech time-compression techniques into interactive voice applications, and the software infrastructure of workstations, portable, and hand-held computers to provide user interfaces for high-speed listening. 3 Considerations There are three variables that can be studied in compressed speech <ref> [Duk74a] </ref>: 1. The type of speech material to be compressed (con tent, language, background noise, etc.). 2. The process of compression (algorithm, mono or stereo presentation, etc.). 3. The listener (prior training, intelligence, listening task, etc.).

Depending on the type of experiment, such words may either be selected from a closed set, or written down (or shadowed) by the subject from an open-ended set. <p> suggest that although individual words and short phrases may remain intelligible after considerable compression by the right method, when these words are combined to form meaningful sequences that exceed the immediate memory span for heard words, as in a listening selection, comprehension begins to deteriorate at a much lower compression. <ref> [Fou71] </ref> 9.2 Limits of Compression There are some practical limitations on the maximum amount that a speech signal can be compressed. Portnoff notes that arbitrarily high compression ratios are not physically reasonable. He considers, for example, a voiced phoneme containing four pitch periods.

Reference-contexts: Comprehension refers to the understanding of the content of the material. This is usually tested by asking questions about a passage of recorded material. In general, intelligibility is more resistant to degradation as a function of time-compression than is comprehension <ref> [Ger74] </ref>. Early studies showed that single well-learned phonetically balanced words could remain intelligible with a 10-15% compression (10 times normal speed), while connected speech remains comprehensible to a 50% compression (twice normal speed). <p> For discard intervals between 40-70ms, dichotic intelligibility was consistently higher than diotic intelligibility [GW77]. A dichotic discard interval of 40-50ms was found to have the highest intelligibility (40ms was described as the optimum interval in another study <ref> [Ger74] </ref>. Earlier studies suggest that a shorter interval of 18-25ms may be better for diotic speech [BM76]). Gerber showed that 50% compression presented diotically was significantly better than 25% compression presented dichotically, even though the information quantity of the presentations was the same. <p> These and other data provide conclusive evidence that 25% compression is too fast for the information to be processed by the auditory system.

Reference-contexts: It is a fast non-iterative optimization of a fourier-based algorithm described in <ref> [GL84] </ref>. Of all time scale modification methods proposed, SOLA appears to be the simplest computa-tionally, and therefore most appropriate for real-time applications [WRW89].

Reference-contexts: Thus, he expects high compression ratios to produce speech with a rough quality and low intelligibility [Por81]. The dichotic advantage (section 6.2) is maintained for compression ratios of up to 33%. For discard intervals between 40-70ms, dichotic intelligibility was consistently higher than diotic intelligibility <ref> [GW77] </ref>. A dichotic discard interval of 40-50ms was found to have the highest intelligibility (40ms was described as the optimum interval in another study [Ger74]. Earlier studies suggest that a shorter interval of 18-25ms may be better for diotic speech [BM76]).

Reference-contexts: Studies have indicated that listening to teaching materials twice that have been speeded up by a factor of two is more effective than listening to them once at normal speed [Sti69]. Time-compressed speech has been used to speed up message presentation in voice mail systems <ref> [Hej90, Max80] </ref>, and in aids for the blind. Speech can be slowed for learning languages, or for the hearing impaired. Time compression techniques have also been used in speech recognition systems to time normalize input utterances to a standard length [Mal79]. <p> This technique provides a locally optimal match between successive frames 7 ; combining the frames in this manner tends to preserve the time-dependent pitch, magnitude, and phase of a signal. The shifts do not accumulate since the target position of a window is independent of any previous shifts <ref> [Hej90] </ref>. The SOLA method is simple and effective as it does not require pitch extraction, frequency-domain calculations, phase unwrapping, and is non-iterative [ME86]. The SOLA technique can be considered a type of selective sampling that effectively removes redundant pitch periods. <p> Several improvements to the SOLA method have been suggested that offer improved computational efficiency, or increased robustness in compression/decompression applications <ref> [ME86, WW88, WRW89, Har90, Hej90] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Comprehension of interrupted speech (as in [ML50]) was good, probably because the temporal duration of the orig inal speech signal was preserved, providing ample time for subjects to attempt to process each word <ref> [HLLB86] </ref>. Compression necessitates that each portion of speech be perceived in less time than normal. However, each unit of speech is presented in a less redundant context, so that more time per unit is required.

Reference-contexts: The braided-speech method continually blended adjacent segments with linear fades, rather than abutting segments [Que74]. Lee describes two digital electronic implementations of the sampling technique <ref> [Lee72] </ref>, and discusses the problems of discontinuities when segments are simply abutted together. 6.2 Sampling with Dichotic Presentation One interesting variant of the sampling method (figure 2D) is achieved by playing the standard sampled signal to one ear and the discarded material to the other ear 5 ([Sco67] summarized in [Orr71]).

Reference-contexts: The greater number of long silence intervals were assumed to reflect the tendency for speakers to hesitate more during spontaneous speech than during oral reading [Min74]. Lass states that juncture pauses are important for comprehension, so they cannot be eliminated or reduced without interfering with comprehension <ref> [LL77] </ref>. Theories about memory suggest large-capacity rapid-decay sensory storage followed by limited capacity perceptual memory. Studies have shown that increasing silence intervals between words increases recall accuracy.

Eliminating intervals with less energy than the short-term average (and no more than one in a row), produced distorted but intelligible speech. This technique produced compressions of 33 to 50 percent. <p> This appeared to be sufficient to prevent different ideas or sentences in the recorded document from running together. This type of rate increase does not affect the intelligibility of individual words within the active speech regions <ref> [Max80] </ref>. Studies of pauses in speech also consider the duration of the non-pause or speech unit. In one study of spontaneous speech, the mean speech unit was 2.3 seconds.

These data suggest that blind subjects will trade increased effort in listening to speech for a greater information rate and time savings [ZDS68].

The energy outputs of the filters are used to drive filters at half the frequency of the original.

Reference-contexts: Several successive frames had to be above or below a threshold in order for a silence or speech determination to be made. TASI (Time Assigned Speech Interpolation) is used to approximately double the capacity of existing transoceanic telephone cables <ref> [MS62] </ref>. Talkers are assigned to a specific channel while they are speaking; the channel is then freed during silence intervals. During busy hours, a talker will be assigned to a different channel about every other talkspurt.

Reference-contexts: The resulting speech is natural, but many people find it exhausting to listen to because the speaker never pauses for breath <ref> [Neu78] </ref>. The simplest methods involve the use of energy or average magnitude measurements combined with time thresholds; other metrics include zero-crossing rate measurements, LPC parameters, etc. A variety of speech/silence detection techniques are reviewed in detail in [Aro92]. <p> Neuburg developed a similar technique in which intervals equal to the pitch period were discarded (but not synchronous with the pitch pulses). Finding the pitch pulses is hard, yet estimating the pitch period is much easier, even in noisy speech <ref> [Neu78] </ref>. Since frequency-domain properties are expensive to compute, it has been suggested that easy-to-extract time-domain features can be used to segment speech into transitional and sustained segments.

Reference-contexts: There is a novelty in listening to time-compressed speech for the first time that is quickly overcome with experience. Even naive listeners can tolerate compressions of up to 50%, and with 8-10 hours of training, substantially higher speeds are possible <ref> [OFW65] </ref>. Orr hypothesizes that the review of previously presented material could be more efficiently accomplished by means of compressed speech; the entire lecture, complete with the instructor's intonation and emphasis might be re-presented at high speed as a review.

Reference-contexts: [Lee72], and discusses the problems of discontinuities when segments are simply abutted together. 6.2 Sampling with Dichotic Presentation One interesting variant of the sampling method (figure 2D) is achieved by playing the standard sampled signal to one ear and the discarded material to the other ear 5 ([Sco67] summarized in <ref> [Orr71] </ref>). Under this dichotic 6 condition, intelligibility and comprehension increase. Most subjects also prefer this technique to a diotic presentation of a conventionally sampled signal. Listeners initially reported a switching of attention between ears, but they quickly adjusted to this unusual sensation.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, the listener cannot scan or skip sections of the recording in the same manner as visually scanning printed text, nor can the listener slow down difficult-to-understand portions of the recording <ref> [Por78] </ref>. Powerful computer workstations with speech input/output capabilities make high quality time-compressed speech readily available. <p> Because the method is not pitch synchronous, and, therefore, does not require pitch marking, it is more robust than pitch-synchronous implementations, yet much higher quality than pitch-independent meth ods. <ref> [Por78] </ref> 6.4 Synchronized Overlap Add Method The synchronized overlap add method (SOLA) first described by Roucos and Wilgus [RW85] has recently become popular in computer-based systems. It is a fast non-iterative optimization of a fourier-based algorithm described in [GL84].

Reference-contexts: This has traditionally been done isochronously at constant sampling intervals without regard to the contents of the signal. Implementing such an algorithm on a general purpose processor is straightforward. Word intelligibility decreases if I d is too large or too small. Portnoff <ref> [Por81] </ref> notes that the duration of each sampling interval should be at least as long as one pitch period (e.g., &gt; 15ms), but should also be shorter than the length of a phoneme. <p> A phase vocoder can be interpreted as a filterbank and thus is similar to the harmonic compressor. A phase vocoder is, however, significantly more complex because calculations are done in the frequency domain, and the phase of the original signal must be reconstructed. Portnoff <ref> [Por81] </ref> developed a system for time-scale modification of speech based on short-time Fourier analysis. His system provided high quality compression of up to 33% while retaining the natural quality and speaker-dependent features of the speech. <p> He considers, for example, a voiced phoneme containing four pitch periods. Greater than 25% compression reduces this phoneme to less than one pitch period, destroying its periodic character. Thus, he expects high compression ratios to produce speech with a rough quality and low intelligibility <ref> [Por81] </ref>. The dichotic advantage (section 6.2) is maintained for compression ratios of up to 33%. For discard intervals between 40-70ms, dichotic intelligibility was consistently higher than diotic intelligibility [GW77].

Reference-contexts: subjects' listening rate preference shifted to faster rates after exposure to compressed speech. 9.4 The Importance of Silence Just as pauses are critical for the speaker in facilitating fluent and complex speech, so are they crucial for the listener in enabling him to understand and keep pace with the utterance. <ref> [Rei80] </ref> : : : the debilitating effects of compressed speech are due as much to depriving listers of ordinarily available processing time, as to degradation of the speech signal itself. [WN80] It may not be desirable to completely remove silences, as they often provide important semantic and syntactic cues. <p> In the perception of normal speech, it has been found that pauses exerted a considerable effect on the speed and accuracy with which sentences were recalled, particularly under conditions of cognitive complexity <ref> [Rei80] </ref>. Pauses, however, are only useful when they occur between clauses within sentencespauses within clauses are disrupting. When a 330ms pause was inserted ungrammatically, response time for a particular task was increased by 2s. Pauses suggest the boundaries of material to be analyzed, and provide vital cognitive processing time.

Reference-contexts: Rippey performed an informal study on users of a time-compression tape player installed in a university library. Virtually all the comments were positive, and the librarians reported that the speech compressor was the most popular piece of equipment in the library <ref> [Rip75] </ref>. The lack of commercial acceptance of time-compressed speech is partly because of the cost of compression devices and the quality of the reproduced speech, but is also attributable to the lack of user control.

Reference-contexts: The decline in comprehension was not attributable to intelligibility alone, but was related to a processing overload of short-term memory. Recent experiments with French have shown that intelligibility and comprehension do not significantly decay until a high rate (300wpm) is reached <ref> [RSLM88] </ref>. Note that in much of the literature the limiting factor that is often cited is word rate, not compression ratios. The compression required to boost the speech rate to 275 words per minute is both talker and context dependent (e.g., read speech is typically faster than spontaneous speech).

Reference-contexts: Scott applied the same ideas to time compression, setting the sampling and discard intervals to be synchronous with the pitch periods of the speech. Discontinuities in the time compressed signal were reduced, and intelligibility increased <ref> [SG72] </ref>. Neuburg developed a similar technique in which intervals equal to the pitch period were discarded (but not synchronous with the pitch pulses). Finding the pitch pulses is hard, yet estimating the pitch period is much easier, even in noisy speech [Neu78].

Of all time scale modification methods proposed, SOLA appears to be the simplest computa-tionally, and therefore most appropriate for real-time applications <ref> [WRW89] </ref>. Conceptually, the SOLA method consists of shifting the beginning of a new speech segment over the end of the preceding segment to find the point of highest cross-correlation. Once this point is found, the frames are overlapped and averaged together, as in the sampling method. <p> Makhoul used both linear and raised cosine functions for averaging windows, and found the simpler linear function sufficient [ME86]. The SOLA algorithm is robust in the presence of correlated or uncorrelated noise, and can improve the signal to noise ratio of noisy speech <ref> [WW88, WRW89] </ref>. 7 The technique does not attempt to provide global optimality.

Reference-contexts: The SOLA method is currently favored for real-time applications, however, a digital version of the Fairbanks sampling method can easily be implemented and produces fair speech quality with little computation. Time-compressed speech has recently begun showing up in voice applications and computer interfaces that use speech <ref> [WSB92] </ref>. Allowing the user to interactively change the speed at which speech is presented is important in getting over the time bottleneck often associated with voice interfaces. The techniques described in this paper can thus aid in user acceptance of voice applications.

Reference-contexts: For blind subjects it was observed that 64-75% time-compression and word rates of 236-275 words per minute were preferred. These data suggest that blind subjects will trade increased effort in listening to speech for a greater information rate and time savings <ref> [ZDS68] </ref>. Comprehension of interrupted speech (as in [ML50]) was good, probably because the temporal duration of the orig inal speech signal was preserved, providing ample time for subjects to attempt to process each word [HLLB86]. Compression necessitates that each portion of speech be perceived in less time than normal.
