Abstract: This paper proposes translucent caching as an alternative to transparent caches. Translucent caches use the fact that network routing forwards a request for an object along the best path from the client to the object's home server. Along this best path, routers direct the request toward a cache chosen among a collection of nearby translucent caches. Unlike transparent caching, which relies on routers to serve as TCP connection intermediaries, translucent caches only use routers to get next-hop cache information. By doing away with TCP connection intermediaries, translucent caches conserve the end-to-end argument-based robustness.

Reference-contexts: The content-location database uses location information to re-direct requests. At the target site, load information can be used to direct the request to the "best" available server. The content-based redirection approach can be used for content servers in general, including Web caches. ArrowPoint Communications <ref> [1] </ref> is currently developing a line of network appliances based on the content-based re-direction concept. 2.3 Transparent Caching Drawbacks The strength of transparent caching is also its main weakness: it violates the end-to-end argument by exposing network routing to higher protocol layers and trying to circumvent it.

Reference-contexts: Several transparent caching schemes have been proposed; we review some of them below. 1 Although most of its customers use it as a load balancing scheme for Web servers, Dispatch can also be applied to Web cache servers. 2 Cache Director Cisco's cache director system <ref> [3] </ref> uses router support to intercept HTTP requests (TCP traffic destined to port 80) and partition them among a collection of cache engines. Each cache engine is assigned a share of the 256 address groups into which the IP address space is split.

Reference-contexts: Clients reference a cache cluster using the cluster's IP address, an IP address to which 2 A similar solution has been proposed for achieving fault tolerance in routers <ref> [6] </ref>. 9 the virtual interfaces of all cluster members are bound. Cache cluster clients such as web browsers will be configured to point to a cluster the same way as they point to regular caches. 3.3.1 The Cluster Failover Protocol (CFP) For simplicity, we assume a cluster of two caches.
