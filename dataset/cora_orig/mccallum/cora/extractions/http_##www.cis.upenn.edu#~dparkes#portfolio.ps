Abstract: Portfolio selection is a general model for the problem of how to allocate resources to maximize utility in an uncertain environment. We present a new multiagent approach to the portfolio selection problem. We show that a group of adaptive cooperative agents will outperform a single adaptive agent for a simple market-based environment model. Furthermore a group of agents can improve its performance further through communication and hint exchange. Finally we show that communication is redundant in an extended market model that includes efficiency constraints on correlations between stock dynamics.

Reference-contexts: The model is based on the mean-variance equilibrium Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) [33, 24], one of the most important developments in modern capital market theory [28] 4 . Although there is some empirical evidence against CAPM <ref> [4] </ref> the CAPM does explain a significant fraction of the price dynamics observed in real stock markets [28]. The key result of CAPM is that the expected excess return of a stock is proportional to the covariance of its return with the "market portfolio".

Reference-contexts: This theoretical measure of performance is actually quite weak when viewed in terms of the final wealth achieved by an optimal worst-case strategy. In fact, the wealth after T periods from EG can be a rapidly decreasing fraction of the BCRP wealth <ref> [5] </ref>. In this paper we investigate whether final-wealth performance can be improved through a cooperative multiagent model of portfolio selection, where each agent uses the 2 approximation to the EG algorithm. <p> Blum and Kalai <ref> [5] </ref> recognize that a group of non-adaptive investors will approximate the worst-case optimal performance of a single EG-adaptive investor as the size of the group gets large, but do not consider a group of adaptive investors.

Reference-contexts: The optimal portfolio strategy will depend on the risk-preferences of the investor. Typically investors are "risk-averse", with concave increasing utility functions over final wealth <ref> [7] </ref>. A good investment strategy will make a tradeoff between expected final-period wealth and variance in final-period wealth to maximize expected utility. <p> While a portfolio may be efficient with respect to a particular set of beliefs about the future dynamics of stock prices, its ex post efficiency is highly dependent on the accuracy of those beliefs. The parameter estimation problem for an economic random-variable is difficult in general <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. 2.1 A Model-Free Portfolio Selection Approach A recent game-theoretic approach to portfolio-selection makes no statistical assumptions about the underlying stock prices, and therefore "side-steps" the parameter estimation problem. <p> This simple market model places no constraints on the joint-distribution between price relatives in a given period t, all stock prices are assumed independent. The dynamics of stocks in real markets are in fact highly, but not perfectly, correlated <ref> [7] </ref>. It is this partial correlation that allows diversification through portfolio investments to reduce, but not eliminate, risk [34]. This leads to our second, more realistic, model of the stock market, that includes "efficiency constraints" and models correlations across stocks.

Reference-contexts: There has been considerable attention to optimal portfolio selection strategies in the financial [12] and statistics [31, 10, 2, 11] literature. In this paper we introduce a new multiagent model that builds on a recent computationally-efficient algorithm for portfolio selection that has a worst-case performance guarantee <ref> [15] </ref>. We present a quantitative assessment of the performance of our multiagent model in a simple stochastic market. The multiagent model for portfolio selection assumes a system of bounded-rational cooperative computational agents. Each agent is assigned a share of the initial wealth to invest, and a random initial portfolio. <p> The parameter estimation problem for an economic random-variable is difficult in general [7, 8]. 2.1 A Model-Free Portfolio Selection Approach A recent game-theoretic approach to portfolio-selection makes no statistical assumptions about the underlying stock prices, and therefore "side-steps" the parameter estimation problem. A new algorithm, Exponentiated Gradient (EG) <ref> [15] </ref>, presents a rule with which an adaptive agent can dynamically update its portfolio from period-to-period. <p> The agent updates its portfolio on the basis of the recent performance of its current portfolio and the stock price dynamics in the last period, without forming a model of the statistics of the market. The 2 algorithm <ref> [15] </ref>, a first-order approximation to EG, generates the portfolio for the next period, w t+1 , according to the update-rule w i = w i ( i where , which we take as positive, is the "learning rate". <p> The 2 algorithm is computationally efficient, and approximates EG well for typical stock-market behavior <ref> [15] </ref>. The update-rule increases the proportion of wealth invested in stocks that outperformed the portfolio in the previous period, and decreases the proportion of wealth invested in stocks that under-performed the portfolio. <p> A small learning rate means that w t+1 will move only slowly towards the optimal strategy, but be less sensitive to period-to-period fluctuations <ref> [15] </ref>. We use the 2 algorithm in the quantita tive sections of this paper. 2.2 Performance Measures The theoretical performance of the EG algorithm is measured within a worst-case framework that is appropriate for a model-free algorithm. <p> The EG algorithm is worst-case optimal with a carefully chosen learning rate, in the sense that it achieves the same asymptotic per-period growth rate as the best constant rebalanced portfolio (BCRP) for any sequence of stock prices <ref> [15] </ref>. This theoretical measure of performance is actually quite weak when viewed in terms of the final wealth achieved by an optimal worst-case strategy. In fact, the wealth after T periods from EG can be a rapidly decreasing fraction of the BCRP wealth [5]. <p> For example, the mean monthly return on stock in IBM between 1962 and 1994 was 1.0081, and the standard deviation in monthly return was 0.062 [8, Page 21]. required is very large estimated to be at least 10 9 for 10 stocks <ref> [15] </ref>. (dots) and 100 non-adaptive agents (line), over 2000 trials. The trials are sorted by final wealth of the non-adaptive agents. market trials. The trials are sorted by the final wealth of the non-adaptive group of agents. <p> In comparison, the group of agents with low learning rates outperforms a group of non-adaptive agents by an average factor of 4.3, but performs more than 80% worse in only 3.7% of the trials (low performance, low risk). The learning rate can be carefully chosen to ensure competitiveness <ref> [15] </ref>, but in general the choice should reflect the risk-aversion of an agent. The agents within the communicating investment group model must also be assigned a switching probability, p, and 4 (dots) and non-adaptive agents (line), over 2000 trials, with a high learning rate. <p> In future work we will investigate the performance of a simple update-rule that has been derived within the same on-line regression framework as EG <ref> [21, 15] </ref>. The update-rule can discover a portfolio on the efficient frontier without explicitly modeling the distributions. Individual problem solving agents that share good portfolio strategies will converge to a portfolio with the same optimal characteristics as the one we considered in this paper.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Portfolios are an effective way of increasing returns while decreasing risk when investing in the stock market <ref> [27] </ref>. The problem of choosing which stocks to invest in is known as the portfolio selection problem. The portfolio-selection problem is a useful model for the decision faced by a computational agent with limited resources, acting in an uncertain environment. <p> Non-linear programming techniques can be used to solve this optimization problem for a restricted class of utility functions, given a statistical model for the future dynamics of the stock market [3]. Modern portfolio theory introduces approximate mean-variance analysis to simplify the portfolio selection problem <ref> [27] </ref>. The basic assumption is that the expected utility of an investor is an increasing function of expected wealth, and a decreasing function of variance in wealth, which is a reasonable approximation for many risk-averse (concave-increasing) utility functions [34].

Reference-contexts: We wish to rule out such a strategy.

The best constant rebalanced portfolio is therefore a worthy performance target. 2 Appendix). This provides a new interpretation of the port-folio selection problem, as a search problem through portfolio space to find the portfolio that maximizes the expected single-period log-return.

Reference-contexts: This leads to our second, more realistic, model of the stock market, that includes "efficiency constraints" and models correlations across stocks. The model is based on the mean-variance equilibrium Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) <ref> [33, 24] </ref>, one of the most important developments in modern capital market theory [28] 4 . Although there is some empirical evidence against CAPM [4] the CAPM does explain a significant fraction of the price dynamics observed in real stock markets [28].

Reference-contexts: The basic assumption is that the expected utility of an investor is an increasing function of expected wealth, and a decreasing function of variance in wealth, which is a reasonable approximation for many risk-averse (concave-increasing) utility functions <ref> [34] </ref>. With this approximation the portfolio selection problem can be reduced to selection over the "efficient frontier" of portfolios. An efficient portfolio minimizes variance over all portfolios with the same expected wealth. The portfolio that minimizes risk for a given level of return can be computed with quadratic programming techniques [34]. <p> <ref> [34] </ref>. With this approximation the portfolio selection problem can be reduced to selection over the "efficient frontier" of portfolios. An efficient portfolio minimizes variance over all portfolios with the same expected wealth. The portfolio that minimizes risk for a given level of return can be computed with quadratic programming techniques [34]. The expected-utility maximization and mean-variance frameworks for portfolio-selection first estimate the parameters that characterize the dynamics of the stock market under a particular model, and then compute the optimal portfolio selection strategy, given the model. The accuracy of the underlying stock-market models are critical. <p> The dynamics of stocks in real markets are in fact highly, but not perfectly, correlated [7]. It is this partial correlation that allows diversification through portfolio investments to reduce, but not eliminate, risk <ref> [34] </ref>.

Figure 8 shows that this is the case, the portfolios of the adaptive agent groups, and the market portfolio, all plot along the same line in mean-variance space. The non-adaptive agents under-perform due to lack of diversification.
