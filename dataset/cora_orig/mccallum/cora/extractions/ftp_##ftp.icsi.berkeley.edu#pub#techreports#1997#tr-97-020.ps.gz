Abstract: Gau periods have been used successfully as a tool for constructing normal bases in finite fields. Starting from a primitive rth root of unity, one obtains under certain conditions a normal basis for F q n over F q , where r is a prime and nk = r 1 for some integer k. We generalize this construction by allowing arbitrary integers r with nk = '(r), and find in many cases smaller values of k than is possible with the previously known approach.

In particular, 2 (20) = 2. More examples for q = 2 are exhibited in Table 2. Tables for special Gau periods are in [6], <ref> [1] </ref>, and [3]. General Gau periods also yield normal bases in situations where 0 q (n) = 1. Some of them are given in Table 1. For q 2 f3; 5; 7; 11g these are all values for 2 n 400 which 0 q (n) = 1.

Reference-contexts: In the sequel we will use several well-known results from algebraic number theory. Proofs of these results can be found in the first chapter of Lang's book <ref> [4] </ref>. Let L be a Galois extension of Q with Galois group G, and let ff 2 L be a normal element, i.e., the Galois-conjugates of ff generate L as a vector space over Q. <p> In a first step we show how to construct normal p-integral elements in the compositum of two linearly disjoint number fields. We will need the following result, a proof of which can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. Fact 17. Let K and L be two linearly disjoint number fields over Q whose discriminants are relatively prime. Then the ring of integers O KL of KL equals O K O L . Proposition 18.

Reference-contexts: In this situation we have ff 2 F q n , and ff is a normal element of F q n over F q if and only if gcd (e; n) = 1, where e is the index of q modulo r. Starting with <ref> [6] </ref>, this construction has been used to find normal bases, in particular the so-called optimal normal bases; see also [2].

Reference-contexts: We close this section by remarking that we cannot expect to obtain normal integral elements in cyclotomic fields of squarefull conductors. The reason for this is that there exist primes p with wild ramification in these fields. By a theorem of E. <ref> [7] </ref> there do not exist normal integral elements in any p-adic completion of these fields, where p is a prime divisor of p.

Unfortunately, 0 q (n) is not always small, and in fact it is sometimes not finite. Fact 2. ( <ref> [8] </ref>, Theorem 3.3.4.) Let p = char (F q ), q = p m and n 2 N positive.
