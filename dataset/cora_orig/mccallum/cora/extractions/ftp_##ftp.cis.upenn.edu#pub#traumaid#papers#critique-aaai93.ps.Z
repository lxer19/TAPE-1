Abstract: In the past, little attention has been paid to critiquing in domains in which reasoning, planning and action are interleaved, or in which actions can change the agent's knowledge in ways that affect subsequent reasoning and planning. This paper discusses the demands these characteristics make on a critiquing system. The goal-directed approach to critiquing that I am developing interacts with a planner both to infer the user's goals and to determine the system's preferences. The model is able to detect interacting goals and comment when two goals may be addressed with a single action. It also detects when unpredictable outcomes may affect actions that have been planned for. The model is being implemented as an interface to TraumAID, a decision support system for the management of severe injuries.

Reference-contexts: Some people have argued that one of the advantages of critiquing is that it does not require a complete specification of the domain in order to be able to critique proposed solutions <ref> [FLMM91] </ref>. This does not mean, however, that it does not require access to a comprehensive knowledge base. Rather, it means that the system designers do not have to specify particular preferences in order to assure that the system will produce a unique solution to every problem. <p> Rather, it means that the system designers do not have to specify particular preferences in order to assure that the system will produce a unique solution to every problem. In some domains, such as the domain of kitchen design considered by the critiquing system JANUS <ref> [FLMM91] </ref>, almost all decisions are based on preferences, and the critiquing process basically involves making sure that certain constraints are met.

Reference-contexts: Here, a global evaluation of the plan is important. The second dimension is the depth of domain knowledge required to produce an effective critique. The most straightforward domains for critiquing are those in which there are established approaches to management, such as the oncology protocols used in ONCOCIN <ref> [LS83] </ref>. Here, the critiquing system needs only to recognize where the user's solution deviates from the established procedure. At the other extreme are problems that require reasoning from basic principles. Miller also identifies an intermediate level of domain knowledge that he refers to as the level of treatment goals. <p> Discrepancies that are not significant, such as those based on differences in standard practice or on personal preferences, need not be mentioned. The majority of medical critiquing systems have been developed in domains which are concerned primarily with the management of patients after an initial diagnosis has been determined <ref> [LS83, Mil84, vdL91] </ref>. They do not consider the possibility that as yet undiagnosed problems might interact with the problem under consideration, nor do they plan for the pursuit of further diagnoses.

Reference-contexts: With such a broad definition, it is not surprising that research on critiquing has been equally broad, addressing, among other issues, how to evaluate the user's proposed solution <ref> [Mil86] </ref>, how viable and effective a critiquing approach can be [vdL91], and how to generate well-organized, fl I would like to thank my advisor, Bonnie Webber, for her comments and suggestions on this paper and throughout the work. <p> This issue was explored by Perry Miller in a series of prototype critiquing systems <ref> [Mil86] </ref>. Miller was interested in identifying domain characteristics that would lend themselves to the critiquing approach. He also looked at how different aspects of critiquing might be more or less important in different domains. This experience led him to identify two dimensions along which domains vary. <p> They do not consider the possibility that as yet undiagnosed problems might interact with the problem under consideration, nor do they plan for the pursuit of further diagnoses.

Reference-contexts: Textual presentation via a monitor requires the physician to look away from the patient to read the system's comments. I am currently exploring the possibility of using synthesized speech, with appropriate intonation patterns, to convey the critique directly to the physician through a head set <ref> [PS93] </ref>. 5 Conclusion As the critiquing approach is applied to more complex domains, the amount and type of knowledge that the critiquing systems have access to will become extremely important. In this paper I have described a model for critiquing in dynamic, unpredictable, multi-goal domains.

Reference-contexts: The level of goals provides an intuitive basis for reasoning about, and critiquing, the management of patients with severe injuries. The use of goals also has advantages for explanation in a critiquing system. Teach and Shortliffe <ref> [TS81] </ref> found that while doctors do not demand that a consultation system always be correct, it must be able to explain its decisions. In order to do this, it is useful to be able to recognize and address the validity of the goals underlying proposed actions.

The plan is evaluated by a number of critiquing tasks (see <ref> [vdL91] </ref>) whose job is to determine when and what to critique.

Reference-contexts: Some decisions can be left up to personal preference simply by choosing not to comment if the user's plan differs from the system's plan on these points. 3 TraumAID TraumAID is a consultation system designed to provide decision support during the initial definitive management phase of patients with serious injuries <ref> [WRC91] </ref>. Trauma management is unlike other domains for which critiquing systems have been developed to date. A patient may have several injuries that cannot be considered independently since the best treatment for an injury in isolation may differ from its best treatment in combination with others. <p> system, derives from the integration of a rule-based reasoner that determines a set of diagnostic and therapeutic goals to be addressed, with a planner that reasons from the set of pending goals and the current situation to produce an appropriate course of action. of this system can be found in <ref> [WRC91] </ref>. 4 Critiquing Trauma Management Plans Preliminary evaluations of data from a validation study currently underway on TraumAID 2.0 (see [CRW93]) suggests that the actual performance of physicians on real cases is not always acceptable to experts in the field of trauma surgery.
