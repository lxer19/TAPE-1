Abstract: Unpredictability in the running time of complete search procedures can often be explained by the phenomenon of heavy-tailed cost distributions, meaning that at any time during the experiment there is a non-negligible probability of hitting a problem that requires exponentially more time to solve than any that has been encountered before (Gomes et al. 1998a). We present a general method for introducing controlled randomization into complete search algorithms. The boosted search methods provably eliminate heavy-tails to the right of the median. Furthermore, they can take advantage of heavy-tails to the left of the median (that is, a non-negligible chance of very short runs) to dramatically shorten the solution time. We demonstrate speedups of several orders of magnitude for state-of-the-art complete search pro cedures running on hard, real-world problems.

Reference-contexts: The second algorithm we randomized was for propositional satisfiability. One of the fastest complete search engines for propositional satisfiability testing is the Satz system of Li and Anbulagan (1997). Satz is a version of the Davis-Putnam-Loveland procedure <ref> (Davis et al. 1962) </ref>, with a heuristic based on choosing a branch variable that maximizes a function of the number of the unit propagations performed when it is set positively or negatively. Satz is the fastest deterministic SAT procedure we have found for the instances discussed in this paper.

Reference-contexts: It would be interesting to explore our randomization approach in context of other backtrack-style approaches, such as dynamic backtracking <ref> (Ginsberg 1993) </ref>. We believe that the generality of the approach will lead to further advances in planning, scheduling, diagnosis, game-playing, and other areas of AI.

Reference-contexts: We will show that the unpredictability in running times for combinatorial algorithms can often be explained by a phenomenon called a heavy-tailed cost distribution <ref> (Gomes et al. 1998a) </ref>. In our preliminary experiments, we plotted the solution times for a deterministic search algorithm running on a random distribution of scheduling problem instances. <p> Even though, the power of randomization in combinatorial search has been informally recognized by others (for recent work in scheduling domains, see e.g., Bresina 1996 and Oddi and Smith 1997), our work provides the first explanation for the potential success of this kind of strategy, in terms of heavy-tailed distributions <ref> (Gomes et al. 1998a) </ref>. As we will see, our data also shows that there is often a clear optimal cutoff value; simply probing down with unit propagation but no backtracking can be ineffective. For example, in Table 3 we have a 0% success rate for a cutoff value of 2. <p> It can often solve smaller instances of these types with less than 100 backtracks. Because its heuristic usually chooses a single 3 branching variable without ties, we added a heuristic equiv-alence parameter to enlarge the choice-set. Heavy-Tailed Cost Distributions In previous work <ref> (Gomes et al. 1998a) </ref>, we show that the tail behavior of randomized complete backtrack style methods is often best modeled using distributions which asymptotically have tails of the Pareto-Levy form, viz. <p> For N = 18, we ran with a cutoff of 500; 000 and solved the instance after 20 tries. Each try took about 1 hour, and the successful run took 350,632 backtracks. Tails on the left are also characterized by an index of stability. Based on our data <ref> (Gomes 1998a) </ref>, we conjecture that ff for the tail on the left is less than 1.0 on hard combinatorial search problems. <p> This is true since the distribution of S exhibits exponential decay for S &gt;cutoff. Conclusions Building on our previous work on heavy-tailed behavior in combinatorial search <ref> (Gomes et al. 1998a) </ref>, we have shown that performance of complete, backtrack-style search algorithms on hard real-world problems can be greatly enhanced by the addition of randomization combined with a rapid restart strategy.

Reference-contexts: By using multiple threads on a 14 processor Sun system, 26 and 28 teams schedules were generated, which is the record as of this writing <ref> (Wetzel and Zabatta, 1998) </ref>. We believe these numbers can be improved upon with our randomization technique. 5 have a non-negligible probably of solving the instance in a very short run. Our fast restart strategy exploits this. See Table 1 for other improvements due to randomization.
