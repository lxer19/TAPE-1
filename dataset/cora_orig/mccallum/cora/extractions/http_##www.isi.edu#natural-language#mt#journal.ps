Title: Machine Transliteration  
Author: Kevin Knight Jonathan Graehl 
Affiliation: University of Southern California University of Southern California  
Abstract: It is challenging to translate names and technical terms across languages with different alphabets and sound inventories. These items are commonly transliterated, i.e., replaced with approximate phonetic equivalents. For example, "computer" in English comes out as "konpyuutaa" in Japanese. Translating such items from Japanese back to English is even more challenging, and of practical interest, as transliterated items make up the bulk of text phrases not found in bilingual dictionaries. We describe and evaluate a method for performing backwards transliterations by machine. This method uses a generative model, incorporating several distinct stages in the transliteration process.

Reference-contexts: Katakana phrases are the largest source of text phrases that do not appear in bilingual dictionaries or training corpora (a.k.a. "not-found words"). However, very little computational work has been done in this area; (Yamron et al., 1994) briefly mentions a pattern-matching approach, while <ref> (Arbabi et al., 1994) </ref> discuss a hybrid neural-net/expert-system approach to (forward) transliteration. The information-losing aspect of transliteration makes it hard to invert.

Reference-contexts: We use this to combine an observed katakana string with each of the models in turn. The result is a large WFSA containing all possible English translations. We have implemented two algorithms for extracting the best translations. The first is Dijkstra's shortest-path graph algorithm <ref> (Dijkstra, 1959) </ref>. The second is a recently-discovered k-shortest paths algorithm (Eppstein, 1994) that makes it possible for us to identify the top k translations in efficient O (m + n log n + kn) time, where the WFSA contains n states and m arcs. The approach is modular.

Reference-contexts: Computational Linguistics Volume ?, Number ? Given a katakana string o observed by OCR, we want to find the English word sequence w that maximizes the sum, over all e, j, and k, of P (w) P (ejw) P (jje) P (kjj) P (ojk) Following <ref> (Pereira and Riley, 1997) </ref>, we implement P (w) in a weighted finite-state acceptor (WFSA) and we implement the other distributions in weighted finite-state transducers (WFSTs). A WFSA is a state/transition diagram with weights and symbols on the transitions, making some output sequences more likely than others. <p> A WFST is a WFSA with a pair of symbols on each transition, one input and one output. Inputs and outputs may include the empty symbol *. Also following <ref> (Pereira and Riley, 1997) </ref>, we have implemented a general composition algorithm for constructing an integrated model P (xjz) from models P (xjy) and P (yjz), treating WFSAs as WFSTs with identical inputs and outputs. We use this to combine an observed katakana string with each of the models in turn.

Reference-contexts: When we use OCR, 7% of katakana tokens are mis-recognized, affecting 50% of test strings, but translation accuracy only drops from 64% to 52%. 6.

One naturally wonders if the problem of translation could conceivably be treated as a problem of cryptography.

Reference-contexts: Automating this process has great practical importance in Japanese/English machine translation. Katakana phrases are the largest source of text phrases that do not appear in bilingual dictionaries or training corpora (a.k.a. "not-found words").
