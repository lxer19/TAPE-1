Title: Accurate and Efficient Fault Simulation of Realistic CMOS Network Breaks

Affiliation: Computer Engineering Board of Studies, University of California at  
Abstract: We present a new fault simulation algorithm for realistic break faults in the p-networks and n-networks of static CMOS cells. We show that Miller effects can invalidate a test just as charge sharing can, and we present a new charge-based approach that efficiently and accurately predicts the worst case effects of Miller capacitances and charge sharing together. Results on running our fault simulator on ISCAS85 benchmark circuits are provided.

Reference-contexts: A transistor path is a sequence of transistors physically connected through their drain and source terminals. Note that transistor stuck-open faults form a subset of network break faults. Renovell and Cambon [16], and Champac et al. <ref> [1] </ref> showed that a transistor stuck-open test set can detect some of the breaks that create floating transistor gates. So, a network break test set is useful not only for detecting network breaks but also other breaks that cause floating transistor gates.

Reference-contexts: Nodes in the first class were assumed to have small enough capacitances so that they could be ignored. If a node in the second class can share charge with the floating cell output, then the test is declared invalidated. Di and Jess <ref> [3] </ref> developed a fault simulator for network breaks, but they ignored static hazards, and their detecting conditions considered charge sharing only with the nodes on the broken paths. <p> Two mechanisms that may invalidate a test, transient paths to Vdd or GND and charge sharing, have been studied by many researchers <ref> [15, 9, 20, 2, 5, 11, 3] </ref>. In this paper, we show that the gate-drain or the gate-source capacitances of the CMOS transistors can modify the voltage of the faulty cell output when it is at high impedance. <p> Even though we did not construct look-up tables for other equations, we ended up with reasonable CPU times as shown in Table 4, in fact, our CPU times per vector are always better than the ones by Di and Jess <ref> [3] </ref>, where they used an HP-9000/700. Table 5 shows our fault coverage results using 1024 random vectors for each circuit.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION Defects that occur during the IC manufacturing process can be categorized into three classes according to Hawkins et al. <ref> [7] </ref>. These classes are bridge, open circuit, and parametric defects. Open circuit defects cause breaks in the conducting materials in the layout, and contacts are particularly susceptible to such breaks.

Reference-contexts: For every MCNC standard cell used in the ISCAS85 circuits, we used the public domain ext2spice program to determine the area and the perimeter of the diffusion region for the drain and source terminals of each transistor in the cell. We used an inductive fault analysis tool, Carafe <ref> [8, 17] </ref>, to get a list of realistic network breaks in the cell.

Reference-contexts: For the definitions of V th , ff x , and V DSAT , and for the reason we assumed V ds to be zero in Equations 3.5 and 3.6, please see our technical report <ref> [10] </ref>. To compute Q g;f in Equation 3.1 we use Equations 3.3, 3.5, and 3.7 depending on the region the fanout transistor f is in. To compute Q ds;t in Equation 3.2 we use Equations 3.4 and 3.6 depending again on the region transistor t is in. <p> The reason we take V g;t;init to be GND when the logic value at gt is 10 is the same. In the following cases and subcases, we will omit the reasoning behind our decisions due to lack of space. Our technical report <ref> [10] </ref> explains the reasons for these decisions. Subcase 1.2 : fcn is in the n-network, and O is initialized to Vdd. In this case, V fcn;init = max n. <p> Assume max n L1 th, then V fcn;final = L1 th, and Table 3 shows how the worst case V g;t;init and V g;t;final values are determined for transistor t connected to node f cn. The case for max n &lt; L1 th is described in our technical report <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> Please see our technical report <ref> [10] </ref> for other connection functions we generate. The standard cells are processed as described above only once, not every time a circuit is fault simulated.

Reference-contexts: Breaks can be divided into two categories: those that physically disconnect one or more transistor gates from their drivers, and those that disconnect transistors from each other in the p-network or n-network of a CMOS cell <ref> [12] </ref>. We define a network break as a break fault in the p-network or in the n-network of a cell that breaks one or more transistor paths between the cell output and Vdd or GND.

The reverse biased p-n junction between the diffusion region and the bulk of a transistor forms the capacitance C pn , whose expression is given in Massobrio and Antognetti <ref> [13] </ref> as a function of the reverse bias voltage V r . Integrating C pn from V r;init to V r;final , we obtain the following charge expression for the p-n junction.

Reference-contexts: So, a network break test set is useful not only for detecting network breaks but also other breaks that cause floating transistor gates. Detection of a network break with voltage measurements requires a two-vector test. Reddy et al. <ref> [15] </ref> showed that transient paths to Vdd or GND can invalidate a two-vector test in transistor stuck-open testing, and Barzilai et al. showed that charge sharing between the internal nodes of the faulty cell and the high impedance faulty cell output can also invalidate a test. <p> Two mechanisms that may invalidate a test, transient paths to Vdd or GND and charge sharing, have been studied by many researchers <ref> [15, 9, 20, 2, 5, 11, 3] </ref>.

Each transistor drain or source terminal ds connected to f cn stores charge in the intrinsic, or channel, area of the transistor t when t is on <ref> [18] </ref>. Some charge is also stored on ds due to the gate overlap capacitance. We denote the charge on ds of t as Q ds;t . 2. Charge is stored in the p-n junction between fcn and the bulk of the transistor, which we denote as Q pn;fcn . <p> The following equations, 3.3 through 3.7, are taken from Sheu, Hsu, and Ko <ref> [18] </ref> to express the charge stored on a transistor gate, denoted by Q g , and the charge stored by the source and the drain terminals in the channel of a transistor, denoted by Q d and Q s .
