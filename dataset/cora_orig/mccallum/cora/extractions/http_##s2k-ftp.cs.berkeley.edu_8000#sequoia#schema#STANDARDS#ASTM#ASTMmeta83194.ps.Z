Abstract: 1.4. There are at least three categories of use for geospatial metadata: 1) to accompany data transfers as documentation, 2) internal, on-line documentation of processing steps and data lineage, and 3) as stand-alone data set synopses for use by spatial data catalogs, indexes, and referral services.
