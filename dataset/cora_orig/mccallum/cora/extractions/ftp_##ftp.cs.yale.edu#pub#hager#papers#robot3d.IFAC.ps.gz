Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to describe a self-adjusting, vision-based controller which is able to control the position of a robotic manipulator without explicit calibration of camera parameters. The control strategy is based on the concepts of cyclic switching (Pait 1993) and dwell-time switching (Morse 1995a). With these techniques, it is possible to design and implement a supervisory control system capable of transferring to and holding at a prescribed set-point, the output of a process modeled by a dynamical system with large scale parametric uncertainty.

INTRODUCTION Advances in image-processing technology have recently made it feasible to build robotic systems which employ vision in a position-control feedback loop <ref> (Corke 1994) </ref>. These systems operate by observing a set-point error measured using vision, and computing a robot motion to drive this error to zero using the Jacobian of the camera projection function.

Reference-contexts: The dynamics of the robot and velocity servo controller are assumed negligible. In vector notation observations of the system can be written as c = (g (r)) = h (; r) (1) where the vector defines the camera calibration parameters, and ffi denotes the multiplicative unmodelled dynamics <ref> (Doyle and Stein 1981) </ref> of the robot and velocity servo controller. Thus, we have _ c = J c (I + ffi)u + @ where J c is the Jacobian of the composition (g (r)).

Reference-contexts: In some cases, the calibration parameters are changing with time. For example, if robot motions are expressed in manipulator (tool) coordinates, then the hand-eye relationship (and hence the image Jacobian) is a function of time <ref> (Hager 1995) </ref>. In this case Jacobian parameter values must therefore be estimated on-line. On-line calibration is also necessary if cameras are allowed to move during operation. Hager et al. recently presented a paradigm for visual control that is simple, accurate, and robust to calibration error (Hager et al. 1995). <p> In this case Jacobian parameter values must therefore be estimated on-line. On-line calibration is also necessary if cameras are allowed to move during operation. Hager et al. recently presented a paradigm for visual control that is simple, accurate, and robust to calibration error <ref> (Hager et al. 1995) </ref>. In particular, the accuracy of visual servoing is calibration independent; only system stability depends on the hand-eye calibration. The fact that the system is robust to calibration error suggests that it might be a good candidate for on-line hand-eye calibration. <p> Since we have four system outputs and three control inputs an additional mapping : R 4 ! R 3 on system outputs is introduced. Possible choices for this mapping are discussed in <ref> (Hager et al. 1995) </ref>. The dynamics of the robot and velocity servo controller are assumed negligible. <p> They are oriented to point back along the y axis of the robot. The experiments described here are based on tracking corners (Hager et al. 1993, Hager 1994), formed by the intersection of two line segments, of two 3.5 inch floppy disks. The system is more fully described in <ref> (Hager et al. 1995) </ref>. The minimization procedure in the system is a quadratic programming problem 4 in a simply bounded linear space of real 3fi3 matrices. The supervisory controller was developed and simulated in Simulink (Mathworks 1992). The controller code was generated from The C Code Generator (Mathworks 1994). <p> The intelligent controller performed nearly identically after rotating both cameras approximately 15 degrees inward.

Reference-contexts: The fact that the system is robust to calibration error suggests that it might be a good candidate for on-line hand-eye calibration. Liang et al. proposed a vision-feedback-based self--adjusting system which can "learn" the hand-eye transformation dynamically and continuously <ref> (Liang et al. 1989) </ref>. However repetitive operation trials are needed since the manipulator may fail in the first one or two trials.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we present an intelligent controller that is able to calibrate a hand-eye system as it moves using no prior information about camera location or camera intrinsic parameters, and does not require repetitive trials. It is based on advances in the area of supervisory control <ref> (Morse 1995a, Morse 1995b) </ref>. In this application, it is assumed that at least one of a set of sequences of linear controllers is capable of achieving desired closed-loop performance. The goal is to intelligently select the right controllers for the uncalibrated process. <p> In the visual control system presented here, the admissible controllers depend on the inverse system Jacobian matrix. Thus, we estimate the inverse Jacobian matrix and switch the corresponding controller into feedback with the process according to dwell-time switching logic <ref> (Morse 1995a) </ref>. Tractability of the parameter estimation problems calls for a linear parameterization and a parameter space which is convex. These requirements make it impossible to rule out the possibility of estimated Jacobian matrices which are singular or close to singular. <p> In the sequel, we write Q for the union Q 4 3. AN ESTIMATOR-BASED CONTROLLER To deal with the assumption that each value of the slowly varying process transfer matrix is in C, we shall employ a parameter dependent estimator-based controller <ref> (Morse 1995a) </ref> which is a stable linear system with inputs , u, and e , states and u, and outputs e P and u Q ; e P is an estimation error and u Q is a candidate signal for u. <p> SUPERVISOR The supervisor examined in <ref> (Morse 1995a) </ref> is a specially structured hybrid dynamical system whose output S is a switching signal taking values in Q and whose inputs are ; u and . <p> (12) In the light of (7) and (12) it is easy to see that these definitions imply that _ P = 2 P + ke P k 2 ; P 2 P: The supervisor's other system, called a dwell-time/cyclic switching logic, is a combined version of the switching logics of <ref> (Morse 1995a) </ref> and (Pait 1993). A detailed description of this logic can be found in the appendix. 5.
