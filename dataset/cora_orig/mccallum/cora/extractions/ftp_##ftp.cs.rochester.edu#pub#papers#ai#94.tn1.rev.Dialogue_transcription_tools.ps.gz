Abstract: This document describes a toolkit and guidelines for the transcription of dialogues. The premise of these tools is that a dialogue between two people can be broken down into a series of utterance files, each spoken by one participant. This allows the transcription tools and standards already designed for single speaker speech to be used.

Reference-contexts: At the University of Rochester, we are involved in a long term research project, the Trains project, to develop an intelligent planning assistant that is conversationally proficient in natural language <ref> (Allen and Schubert, 1991) </ref>. In order to provide empirical data to drive our research, we are collecting dialogues between two people, one playing the role of the system and the other playing the role of a manager, who has a certain planning problem to solve.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, one of the silences is at a speech repair (34.0 sec), and the repair involves word correspondences starting with the word "and" at 29.0 sec. and ending with the word "boxcars" at 36.0 sec. So, segmenting anywhere within this range would separate a local phenomenon <ref> (Heeman and Allen, 1994) </ref>. Hence, for this example, we are forced to violate requirement A2, due to the lack of a suitable place that meets one of the conditions C1 through C4.

Reference-contexts: However, conversants are not always this well-behaved. Although accounting for no more than 5% of dialogues, there are times when more than one participant is speaking <ref> (Levinson, 1983, pg. 296) </ref>. These might be back-channel responses, such as "okay", or "uh-huh", or the other conversant might be trying to repair an utterance, or he just might be trying to steal the turn, perhaps because it is not necessary for the speaker to finish her thought.
