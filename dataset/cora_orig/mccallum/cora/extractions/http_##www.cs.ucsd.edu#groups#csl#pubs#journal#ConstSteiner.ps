Abstract: We present heuristics for multicast tree construction for communication that depends on: (i) bounded end-to-end delay along the paths from source to each destination, and (ii) minimum cost of the multicast tree, where edge cost and edge delay can be independent metrics. This problem of computing such a constrained multicast tree is NP-complete. We show that the heuristics demonstrate good average case behavior in terms of cost, as determined through simulations on a large number of graphs. Keywords: Multicast, Steiner tree, delay-bounded communication

Reference-contexts: The least cost tree is called a Steiner tree [5], and the problem of finding a Steiner tree is known to be NP-complete [7]. Furthermore, the problem remains NP-complete, even if edges have unit cost [4]. Several algorithms that construct low-cost multicast routes <ref> [1, 6, 13, 14] </ref> are based on heuristics for approximate Steiner trees [10, 11, 12]. Empirical observations show that the heuristics produce near optimal trees quickly. The algorithms take polynomial time, ranging from O (n 3 ) to O (n 4 ).

Reference-contexts: A minimum average path delay tree can be constructed in O (n 2 ) time using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm <ref> [2] </ref>, where n is the number of nodes in the graph. The second measure of efficiency is in terms of the cost of the multicast tree, C T , which is the sum of the costs on the edges in the multicast tree. <p> For comparison, Dijkstra's shortest paths algorithm takes O (n 2 ) time <ref> [2] </ref>. 5 Conclusions Multimedia communications researchers are more and more aware of the inadequacies of existing network protocols and algorithms to handle continuous media such as audio and video.

Reference-contexts: Although this problem is NP-complete [4] for arbitrary values of , we assume to be a bounded integer, and therefore the solution takes polynomial time in the size of the graph. We compute the all-pairs constrained cheapest paths using a dynamic programming approach similar to Floyd's shortest path algorithm <ref> [3] </ref>. We define C d (v; w) to be the cost of the cheapest path from v to w with delay exactly d. If there are multiple cheapest constrained paths with the same cost, then the one with the least delay is chosen.

The algorithms take polynomial time, ranging from O (n 3 ) to O (n 4 ). <p> In our formulation, a multicast tree is a constrained Steiner tree, i.e., a delay-bounded minimum cost tree, where the delay bound is specified by the application performing the multicast. Kadaba and Jaffe <ref> [6] </ref> studied a problem that involves optimizing on both the cost and delay measures of the multicast tree. They investigated how a compromise could be struck between minimizing D T and C T .

They investigated how a compromise could be struck between minimizing D T and C T . There are two primary differences between our approach and that of [6]. The fundamental difference is that we assume that edge cost and edge delay are different functions. For example, edge cost could be a measure of the amount of buffer space or channel bandwidth used, and edge delay could be a combination of propagation, transmission, and queueing delay.

Reference-contexts: We shall assume that is a bounded integer value. The constrained Steiner tree can now be described as a constrained spanning tree such that P e 2 T C (e) is minimized. We note that this problem is NP-complete since it reduces to the standard Steiner tree problem <ref> [8] </ref>. 1 We consider only simple graphs, i.e., graphs with only one edge between two nodes. 3 Heuristics for the Constrained Steiner Tree In the following, we assume that the source has all the information necessary to construct the multicast tree. We call these algorithms source-based routing algorithms. <p> Initial measurements with small graphs showed that OPT and CST C had comparable performance (see Fig.7, and <ref> [8] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Interestingly, for the distributed algorithms, we find that the heuristic that uses f CD works better than the one using f C <ref> [9] </ref>. The nodes in the graphs were randomly placed in a unit square, and the edge delays were proportional to the Euclidean distance separating the endpoints. We used both unit edge costs and random edge cost generated uniformly from the set f1; : : : ; 10g.
