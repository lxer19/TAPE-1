Abstract: Packaging technologies impose various physical constraints on bisection bandwidth, pinout, and channel width of a system whereas processor and interconnect technologies lead to certain demanded throughput on network bisection. Earlier studies in literature have proposed hierarchical and clustered interconnections by considering the effect of limited packaging constraints. Pinout technologies and capacity of packaging modules have been ignored, often leading to configurations which are not design-feasible. In this paper, we solve this design problem by proposing a new supply- demand optimization framework. This generalized framework uses parameterized representation of processor board area, pinout technologies (periphery or surface), channel width, and channel speed. The family of flat k-ary n-cube topologies and their clustered variations (k-ary n-cube cluster-c) are evaluated to derive optimal configurations which can lead to cost-effective design of scalable parallel systems using wormhole-routing. The analysis identifies processor board area, channel width, and pinout density as critical parameters. The study indicates that cluster-based parallel systems can deliver better performance with lower cost. It is predicted that optimal configurations for future systems will be cluster-based (2-10 processors per cluster) with 3D/4D/5D inter-cluster interconnection. This framework is quite general to capture technological trends of future years. The framework is validated by the design solutions of current machines using contemporary technologies.

Large parallel machines, on the other hand, 8 typically employ several levels of packaging. There are inherent technological constraints that limit VLSI die sizes, board areas, number of boards per card-cage, and number of card-cages per cabinet, etc. <p> Supporting an arbitrary channel width is not easy because it has impact on router design. Agrawal realized the importance of this constraint and analyzed system designs under fixed channel width <ref> [2] </ref>. For a simpler interface design, the width of data lines in a channel is expected to maintain an integral relationship with that of processor and memory which are typically in multiples of a byte.

Reference-contexts: Moreover the techniques which work for two-level hierarchies can be easily extended to design more levels. Examples of previous work in this area include two-level systems based on hypercube and other network topologies [12, 20, 24], MINs and n-hop networks [24], two-level systems with k-ary n-cube topologies <ref> [4] </ref>, and combination of bus and mesh/hypercube networks [14]. How- ever, most of these analyses did not take into account packaging and interconnecting constraints. <p> The impact of the changes in processor and interconnect technologies in relation to packaging technology was also not studied. Analogously in our analysis we focus on two-level clustered architectures based on a k-ary n-cube cluster-c <ref> [4, 6] </ref> interconnection. These are clustered extensions of the flat k-ary n-cube systems. Our design model is more comprehensive and flexible in terms of considering packaging and interconnect constraints. <p> Referring to the set of design-feasible configurations and their performance characteristics as what the packaging technology offers, we call this the supply side. On the other hand, to sustain processor performance in terms of throughput places a demand on the size of the required bisection bandwidth <ref> [4, 24] </ref> of the system. The design-feasible configurations which offer performance greater than what is demanded are defined as good configurations. Among the good choices the one which provides desired performance at optimal cost is defined as the best configuration. Our goal is to derive this best topology. <p> Recently, we have introduced a new k-ary n-cube cluster-c organization <ref> [4, 5, 21] </ref> to capture this upcoming trend in building scalable parallel systems. In this organization, the lower level consists of k n clusters of processors. These clusters are interconnected by a higher level direct k-ary n-cube network (also referred to as inter-cluster network or internet).

These are clustered extensions of the flat k-ary n-cube systems. Our design model is more comprehensive and flexible in terms of considering packaging and interconnect constraints. <p> Hence, for illustrating our framework we consider board sizes to hold a maximum of 16 processors. To build a system with N processors we need a total board area N . However, board area being precious <ref> [6] </ref>, we suggest using a total board area = N . All boards used in a system are assumed to be of the same size and 1 b 16. The total number of boards used in designing an N -processor system is defined as N boards = N=b. <p> This corresponds to a channel width of W 24 including control, acknowledgment, and parity wires. Many factors like path-width inside routers and connector technology restrict channel widths from being arbitrarily large. In the near future it is expected that technologies would allow channels to carry 32-bit and 64-bit data <ref> [6, 22] </ref>, corresponding to W 40 and 72, respectively. Larger channel widths would make effective message lengths shorter leading to lower message latencies and lesser contention in routing [8, 11] thus yielding better system performance.

Reference-contexts: Over the years board sizes have grown in physical dimensions. We now have systems like MIT J-machine [19] which put 64 processors on a board. However, the J-machine uses fine-grained nodes <ref> [9] </ref> with integrated processor and router organization. The memory provided per processor is also small compared to other contemporary commercial systems and research prototypes. The current trend in building large parallel systems is to use off-the-shelf commodity processors and to provide a few megabyte of memory per processor.

For example, in a k-ary n-cube interconnection with W-bit wide channels, the bisection size can be derived as fi = 4k n1 W [11]. Let t be defined as the cycle time, the time to transfer a bit across a wire in seconds. In other words, a set of W parallel wires can transfer W bits simultaneously in time t. <p> Current trends in board and pinout technologies are investigated and a general scheme is presented to parameterize the architectural characteristics with respect to these technologies. 4.1 Hierarchical Packaging Model Some earlier models, proposed to capture packaging constraints, like the VLSI model with limited bisection bandwidth as proposed by Dally <ref> [11] </ref> and the limited pincount model as proposed by Agrawal [2] deal with only one level of packaging.

Supporting an arbitrary channel width is not easy because it has impact on router design. Agrawal realized the importance of this constraint and analyzed system designs under fixed channel width [2]. <p> The good configurations which yield actual system sizes outside this range are dropped. The actual bisection size offered by this configuration is 4608 (obtained using Eqn. 5.4). The average distance to be traveled in the internet is 3.75, obtained as n i=1 k i =4 <ref> [11] </ref>. The total number of internet channels can be obtained as 2n (N=c) yielding a value of 1536 for this configuration. This is a measure of the number of inter-cluster connectors required. <p> 3.50 12 8K 2x2x2x3x2x3 1008 3.50 14 8K 2x2x2x3x2x3 1152 3.50 16 8K b of clusters on b oard b 0 3 8x8x8 1024 6.00 14 2K 4x4x4x4 1024 4.00 12 8K It has been recently demonstrated that that it is easier to build lower dimensional systems with 2D/3D interconnections <ref> [10, 11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Recently, we have introduced a new k-ary n-cube cluster-c organization <ref> [4, 5, 21] </ref> to capture this upcoming trend in building scalable parallel systems. In this organization, the lower level consists of k n clusters of processors. These clusters are interconnected by a higher level direct k-ary n-cube network (also referred to as inter-cluster network or internet). <p> The main task of the cluster interface is to handle the volume of communication to/from the cluster. Other functionalities may be added to the cluster interface to efficiently implement various communication, synchronization, and cache- coherence operations to enhance overall system performance <ref> [13, 21] </ref>. However, such discussion is beyond the scope of this paper. The memory in the system is distributed physically across the clusters to increase overall memory bandwidth. Organization of memory within a cluster is left as an open choice depending on the size of cluster and its configuration.

Reference-contexts: This leads to no change in the required fi d u and fi d l . To derive representative values of in current and future systems, we consider predictions made by Patterson <ref> [22] </ref>. As shown in Table 2 the future values of will broadly lie in the range of 4-10. Table 2: Sample values of for various representative combinations of processor and network speeds. To support larger sized clusters, the intra-cluster bisection bandwidth should scale linearly with size c. <p> This corresponds to a channel width of W 24 including control, acknowledgment, and parity wires. Many factors like path-width inside routers and connector technology restrict channel widths from being arbitrarily large. In the near future it is expected that technologies would allow channels to carry 32-bit and 64-bit data <ref> [6, 22] </ref>, corresponding to W 40 and 72, respectively. Larger channel widths would make effective message lengths shorter leading to lower message latencies and lesser contention in routing [8, 11] thus yielding better system performance.

Reference-contexts: Agrawal's [2] analysis of the same class of networks considers three different constraints: constant bisection width, constant channel width, and constant pinout and is based on a more comprehensive model of node and wire delays. However, Ranade <ref> [23, 24] </ref> and Yew [15] argued that neither Dally's VLSI model with limited bisection bandwidth nor the limited pinout model as proposed in [1, 2] is adequate for very large systems. Both models confine to only one level of packaging hierarchy whereas large systems typically employ several levels of packaging. <p> There are inherent technological constraints that limit VLSI die sizes, board areas, number of boards per card-cage, and number of card-cages per cabinet, etc. Hence, multi-level hierarchies are inevitable for packaging large parallel systems consisting of thousands of processors. Similar to the characterization of multi-level packaging hierarchies in <ref> [23] </ref>, we model the packaging hierarchy as consisting of l levels 0; 1; :::; l 1. A packaging module in level-i is referred to as a m i . Each m i contains some number of m i1 modules and these in turn contain m i2 modules and so on. <p> However, there are two other important considerations while selecting a configuration. It should offer low average message latency and it should have low cost. Thus, among the good configurations we are interested in the best configuration <ref> [23] </ref> which provides best performance at lowest cost. From Tables 6 and 7, it is to be noted that under most combinations of pinout density and channel width technology, we are left with around 15-20 good choices from which we have to select the best one. <p> The total number of internet channels can be obtained as 2n (N=c) yielding a value of 1536 for this configuration. This is a measure of the number of inter-cluster connectors required. Connector cost being quite high <ref> [23] </ref>, a natural design guideline would be to opt for configurations which require less number of connectors. The board size of 6, used to place the clusters in this configuration, is the same as the cluster size. Therefore only one cluster is placed on each board.

It was demonstrated in <ref> [24] </ref> that considering two-level hierarchical/clustered systems widen the scope of the design-space. The architectural levels can be chosen to closely match the packaging hierarchy leading to better designs. A variety of two-level hierarchical configurations have been proposed by researchers in the past to build scalable systems. <p> Moreover the techniques which work for two-level hierarchies can be easily extended to design more levels. Examples of previous work in this area include two-level systems based on hypercube and other network topologies <ref> [12, 20, 24] </ref>, MINs and n-hop networks [24], two-level systems with k-ary n-cube topologies [4], and combination of bus and mesh/hypercube networks [14].

Guidelines developed in <ref> [14, 24] </ref> were based only on fixed board sizes with fixed pinouts, and did not consider changes in board sizes and alternate pinout technologies. The impact of the changes in processor and interconnect technologies in relation to packaging technology was also not studied. <p> Referring to the set of design-feasible configurations and their performance characteristics as what the packaging technology offers, we call this the supply side. On the other hand, to sustain processor performance in terms of throughput places a demand on the size of the required bisection bandwidth <ref> [4, 24] </ref> of the system. The design-feasible configurations which offer performance greater than what is demanded are defined as good configurations. Among the good choices the one which provides desired performance at optimal cost is defined as the best configuration. Our goal is to derive this best topology. <p> It is easy to observe that the flat k-ary n-cube can be derived as a special case of the k-ary n-cube cluster-c family by choosing cluster size c = 1. Since inter-cluster interconnections are more expensive than intra-cluster interconnections <ref> [24] </ref>, in this paper we primarily emphasize on internet and cluster size. In the following sections, we develop a supply-demand optimization framework to derive optimal k-ary n-cube cluster-c organizations (c 1). <p> A localized traffic model would yield (p &gt; c=N ) leading to lesser demanded bisection B d u . However, while designing a general- purpose machine without prior knowledge of the nature of the applications to be executed on it, an uniform traffic model is considered more representative <ref> [24] </ref>. The demand on bisection bandwidth inside a cluster can be divided into three components, shown as flows f 1 , f 2 , and f 3 in Fig. 4. The flow f 1 corresponds to the local traffic across bisection and is given by cDp=2. <p> Table 2: Sample values of for various representative combinations of processor and network speeds. To support larger sized clusters, the intra-cluster bisection bandwidth should scale linearly with size c. Since packaging constraints are less rigid in lower hierarchies, it is possible to provide thicker channel/buses for higher bandwidth <ref> [24] </ref>. Hence in this paper, we focus on minimum bisection size in the upper level, fi d u . The demanded bisection is parameterized with respect to thus capturing advances in both processor and interconnection speeds.

Reference-contexts: As a general observation in applications, an amount of computation is associated with a quota of necessary communication, expressed as the communication to computation ratio (r) <ref> [25] </ref>. Intuitively it is clear that with increase in processing speeds computations take less time. This requires the associated communications to also occur faster leading to greater demands on the network bandwidth. <p> With a given processor technology, let us define D bits/sec as the rate of traffic which each processor injects into the network. An increase in processing power leads to a higher value of D. A typical estimate of the range of communication to computation ratio (r), as suggested in <ref> [25] </ref>, is r = 1 to 5 Flop/byte.
