Note: Software architecture of the INFOPAD  
Abstract: This paper describes a software architecture for the Infopad mobile computing system. The software architecture, called Infonet, supports the use of multimedia services in the Infopad mobile system. First, an overview of the Infopad project is presented and the projects basic characteristics are out lined. Next, the Infonet architecture is defined and its use is illustrated by three scenarios: pad activa-tion, application initialization, and handoff. Measurements from an existing prototype demonstrate the systems feasibility. Finally, the future direction of work on the Infonet system is discussed.

Reference-contexts: The goal of this project is to create a mobile computing environment which supports mul-timedia. An overview of Infopad system is shown in Figure 1 and is described in <ref> [Sheng92] </ref>. The basis of the Infopad system design is the Pad, a portable terminal capable of displaying motion video, audio, graphics, and text. The Infopad system places no general purpose computation resources on the Pad. <p> The goals of the Infonet system differ substantially from other efforts. The most important difference is that Infonet attempts to support mobility and multimedia service without the use of processing on the mobile device [Goodman91] <ref> [Sheng92] </ref>. This paper presents the architectural model that was chosen to support the wireless link and multimedia applications. In addition, data collected from an existing prototype are presented to demonstrate that the architecture pro-posed is feasible. Finally, we discuss the future direction of the project. <p> The first prototype includes: Pad: A prototype Pad has been developed, which supports full X-window graphics, bidirectional audio and pen-input. A 640x480 pixel black and white LCD screen (a Gazelle Graphic System) is used for display purposes. Color video is available on a separate display <ref> [Sheng92] </ref>. Link: The link between the Pad and the system is implemented with the Ariel SBUS interface card. It is a wired full duplex 1Mbps connection designed to simulate the wireless link.

Reference-contexts: This requires the communication handoff between cells of the wireless network be done in a quick and efficient manner. Techniques for this handoff are discussed in <ref> [Keeton93] </ref>. Quality of Service Applications supported by the Infopad system have different communication requirements. For example, video requires high bandwidth and low reliability while user input/commands require relatively low bandwidth and high reliability.

Reference-contexts: Infonet, a software architecture for the Infopad system, was developed using the requirements listed above. The goals of the Infonet system differ substantially from other efforts. The most important difference is that Infonet attempts to support mobility and multimedia service without the use of processing on the mobile device <ref> [Goodman91] </ref> [Sheng92].
