Abstract: This paper describes an algorithm that solves a large-scale industrial resource reallocation problem. The problem is to find ways of making opportunistic changes to a current allocation of resources to tasks. Certain essential features of the problem domain, in combination with its reactive rather than constructive character, mean that it is not a natural candidate for constraint programming. We show that constraints can be used in a pre-processing phase that allows a simple reallocation algorithm to work efficiently and effectively. To comply with the wishes of our industrial client, the technique is presented here in general terms involving tasks, resources and setup times. However, the relevance of the technique for reallocation problems, particularly in transportation and manufacturing, will be clear.

Reference-contexts: The ideas presented here have been implemented in an industrial prototype which is about to enter its trial phase. The implementation language has been the Constraint Logic Programming Language ECL i PS e <ref> [Mei94] </ref>. To comply with the wishes of our industrial client, the technique is presented here in general terms involving tasks, resources and setup times, but the relevance of the technique for reallocation problems particularly in transportation and manufacturing should be clear.
