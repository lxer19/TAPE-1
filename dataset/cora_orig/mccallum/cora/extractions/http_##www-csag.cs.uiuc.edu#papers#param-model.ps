Abstract: A great deal of research has been published on the performance of wormhole routers with advanced features such as adaptivity and virtual lanes. In most cases, the effectiveness of such novel routers is evaluated on the basis of the achieved network throughput (channel utilization), ignoring the important effects of implementation complexity. In this paper we describe a parameterized cost model for router performance, characterized by two numbers: router delay and flow control time. Grounding the cost model in a 0.8 micron gate array technology, we use it to compare a number of proposed routing algorithms. Based on these design studies, several insights regarding the implementation complexity of adaptive routing are clear. First, header update and selection is expensive in adaptive routers, suggesting the absolute addressing should be reconsidered. Second, virtual channels are expensive in terms of latency and cycle time, so decisions to include them to support adaptivity or even virtual lanes should not be taken lightly. Third, requirements of larger crossbars and more complex arbitration cause some increase in the complexity of adaptive routers, but the rate of increase is small. Finally, the complexity of adaptive routers significantly increases their setup delay and flow control cycle times, implying that claims of performance advantages in channel utilization and low load latency must be carefully balanced against losses in achievable implementation speed.

Reference-contexts: While no single router architecture is appropriate for all routing algorithms and possible design parameters, this basic architecture is attractive for a range of routing algorithms [14, 8, 28] and has in fact been used for a number of practical routers <ref> [14, 15, 29, 4, 31, 9] </ref>. Our canonical router architecture captures an attractive design for networks of modest dimension and modest numbers of virtual channels, providing a basis for direct comparisons amongst a set of routing algorithms. <p> However, the VC delay increases logarithmically in the number of virtual channels due to arbitration for the physical channel. 4.2 An Instantiated Cost Model Our parameterized model is based on a family of routers designed in the past year <ref> [4] </ref>. However, because the constants are not explicit, it cannot be used to make evaluations of relative importance of factors to router speed nor for comparisons between routing algorithms. <p> However, this advantage is tenuous, as adding even a few virtual lanes (and the required virtual channel controllers) to dimension order routing can effectively eliminate the speed advantage <ref> [5, 4] </ref>. 5.2 Planar-Adaptive Router slice for one adaptive plane is shown. Planar-adaptive routing (PAR) has been proposed as an inexpensive form of adaptive routing [8]. PAR is a minimal adaptive router which reduces the cost of adaptive routing by limiting it to only two dimensions at a time. <p> Avoiding the requirement of virtual channel controllers simplifies routers, giving significant performance benefits. A more detailed analysis of these issues can be found in <ref> [5, 4] </ref>. channels router. <p> This model captures the cost and achievable speed of the basic routing functions, providing a basis for calibrating simulation studies and the complexity of a wide variety of routing algorithms. Instantiating this for a particular technology, CMOS gate arrays, based on a family of router designs <ref> [4] </ref>, provides one set of constants for the parameterized model, allowing the direct comparison and evaluation of several specific routing algorithms on the basis of router setup delay and flow control speed.

This is particularly true for the low-dimensional networks which are the most attractive candidates. 5 For more details see <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: All of the routers considered in this paper can be used in k-ary n-cube topologies. 2.1 Wormhole Routing The performance of parallel systems is closely tied to the throughput and latency provided by their routing networks.

A variety of studies show chip crossing times from below one to as many as several nanoseconds <ref> [20, 25] </ref> with the primary determining factors being the electrical characteristics of the wires, determined by packaging choices. If the system is asynchronous, or there is significant clock skew, additional margins are required to acquire synchronization at these chip crossings.

All of these machines use topologies from the family of k-ary n-cubes. That is, in systems with k n nodes, the networks have n dimensions and k nodes along each dimension.

Reference-contexts: A number of schemes have been developed which solve this problem [10, 28]. 2.2 Adaptive Routing Adaptive routing has been proposed as a means of improving network throughput and performance robustness. A wide variety of adaptive routing al gorithms have been proposed <ref> [24, 12, 16, 8, 28, 6] </ref>. However to date, most evaluations of adaptive routing algorithms use register transfer level simulation which shows how adaptive routing increases channel utilization but cannot measure the impact of additional router complexity on network latency and bandwidth. <p> However, while adaptive routing increases routing freedom, it also increases the cost of deadlock prevention. Significant additional hardware may be required (as much as 2 n1 virtual channels for fully adaptive routing in n-dimensional networks <ref> [24] </ref>). Further, adaptive routing increases the complexity of routing decision logic and crossbar size. Both of these costs can reduce router speed, and thus must be weighed against the benefits of adaptive routing to determine how much adaptivity and which routing algorithm is most attractive. <p> Several were excluded because they appear to be significantly more complex than the routers included. In particular, the Dally-Aoki router [12], the Linder-Harden router <ref> [24] </ref>, the Ngai-Seitz router [27] fall into this category. Another interesting approach, the Chaos router [22], requires a significantly different basic router architecture based on virtual cut-through routing, and therefore was omitted. Basically, we tried to choose an interesting variety of the simplest adaptive, wormhole routing algorithms.

Reference-contexts: If inter-router delay is significant, it reduces the importance of differences in intra-router delay. A variety of studies show chip crossing times from below one to as many as several nanoseconds <ref> [20, 25] </ref> with the primary determining factors being the electrical characteristics of the wires, determined by packaging choices. If the system is asynchronous, or there is significant clock skew, additional margins are required to acquire synchronization at these chip crossings.

Reference-contexts: We instantiate our parametric model, using a 0.8 micron gate array technology and produce specific constants for all aspects of the model. This model is then used to compare a selection of routing algorithms: dimension order [14], planar adaptive [8], turn model <ref> [28] </ref>, and *-channels [6]. The comparison produces a variety of insights about the relative latency and achievable clock rate of these routers. <p> The obvious disadvantage is that by allowing a message to retain the buffers and channels, wormhole routing increases the possibility of resource cycles which cause deadlock. A number of schemes have been developed which solve this problem <ref> [10, 28] </ref>. 2.2 Adaptive Routing Adaptive routing has been proposed as a means of improving network throughput and performance robustness.

However to date, most evaluations of adaptive routing algorithms use register transfer level simulation which shows how adaptive routing increases channel utilization but cannot measure the impact of additional router complexity on network latency and bandwidth. <p> Concerns about the complexity of adaptive routers are not new, as a number of researchers have proposed limited adaptive routing schemes which reduce both routing freedom and hardware complexity <ref> [8, 16, 28] </ref>. Several examples of such routing algorithms are studied in Section 5. 3 Basic Router Functions router, data and flow control paths only. A wormhole router must perform several basic functions: switching, routing, flow control, multiplexing physical channels, inter-chip signalling and clock re covery. <p> Following the last flit, the switch connection is broken and the output freed for subsequent communications. While no single router architecture is appropriate for all routing algorithms and possible design parameters, this basic architecture is attractive for a range of routing algorithms <ref> [14, 8, 28] </ref> and has in fact been used for a number of practical routers [14, 15, 29, 4, 31, 9]. <p> Routing Latency The per-node routing latency consists of two parts: the inter-router delay and the internal router latency. We focus on the internal router 1 For some routing algorithms <ref> [8, 28] </ref>, the router state is only used to choose between deadlock-free alternatives, allowing the router state to be approximate. <p> Adding virtual channels incurs significant overhead and may directly affect the speed of signalling that a router can achieve. 5.3 The Turn Model The turn model is an interesting alternative approach to adaptive routing which prevents deadlock without virtual channels <ref> [28] </ref>. The turn model encompasses a large collection of routing algorithms. However, there are a range of similar algorithms; we consider the negative-first algorithm. It can be used in arbitrary dimensioned networks, and is provably deadlock free.

Numerous implementations of dimension-order routers have been constructed by both researchers and companies <ref> [14, 15, 19, 32, 9, 18, 31] </ref>. Applying our canonical router architecture produces a dimension-order router (see Figure 5) which corresponds to the basic organization of all of these designs. <p> This means that the router could achieve 280fi10 6 flow control operations per second or 280 fi 10 6 flits per second along any particular channel. The setup time and router cycle time compare favorably with a mature series of routers designed by Seitz's group at Caltech <ref> [31] </ref>. 3 As our studies will show, the dimension-order router is significantly simpler in both setup and flow control than any of the other adaptive routers, giving faster operation. <p> Later studies optimized the internal architectures based on the regularity of dimension-order routing, partitioning crossbars and subdividing the router into a set of smaller, identical router automata. These organizational improvements produce significant performance improvements, culminating in an organization similar to the router architecture shown in Figure 5 <ref> [15, 19, 31] </ref>. However, these studies have focused on dimension-order routing and have not directly considered the cost of adaptive routing. A number of commercial wormhole routers have also been constructed for the Symult 2010 [32] and the Intel Paragon [9, 18].
