Abstract: Discourse markers, also known as cue words, are used exten sively in humanhuman taskoriented dialogs to signal the struc ture of the discourse. Previous work showed their importance in monologues for marking discourse structure, but little attention has been paid to their importance in spoken dialog systems. This paper investigates what discourse markers signal about the up coming speech, and when they tend to be used in taskoriented dialog. We demonstrate that there is a high correlation between specitc discourse markers and specitc conversational moves, between discourse marker use and adjacency pairs, and between discourse markers and the speaker's orientation to information presented in the prior turn.

Reference-contexts: This collaboration is necessary to en sure that the agents maintain a coordinated set of beliefs about what each other is contributing to the dialog as well as the current state of the dialog. This is achieved by a process called grounding <ref> [1] </ref>, and accounts for a signit cant amount of the conversational energy in humanhuman dialogs, as displayed by the frequent use of acknowledg ments, backchannel responses, and paraphrases [5]. <p> Since discourse markers signal how the current turn ties in structurally with the preceding dialog, do they also signal anything about the grounding of information pro vided in that turn? The same set of Trains dialogs were annotated using 6 strength levels of grounding evidence described below, and taken from <ref> [1] </ref>. The grounding level does not take into account any initial discourse markers. Strength of Grounding Evidence Level 0 The trst turn in a dialog (which has nothing to ground) and tlled pauses.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION In humanhuman taskoriented dialogs, discourse mark ers abound. Discourse markers are a linguistic devise that speakers use at the beginning of a contribution to signal its relationship to the current discourse state <ref> [2, 3, 7, 8] </ref>. For instance, discourse markers can be used to mark changes in the global discourse structure, as exemplited by `by the way' to mark the start of a digression and `anyway' to mark the return from one.

Reference-contexts: Since dis course markers occur in turninitial position, the recogni tion and understanding of these markers can help narrow the alternatives for what will follow. This paper describes the results of annotating tve di alogs from the Trains corpus <ref> [4] </ref>. The dialogs contained a total of 471 utterances, 401 turns, and 24.5 minutes of speech. For the purposes of this study, only turninitial speech acts which began with a discourse marker were studied; discourse marker phrases internal to a turn were not considered.

Reference-contexts: dis course markers provide strong clues about the relation of the upcoming speech to the current discourse state. 2.1 Conversational moves beginning with `Oh' Prior work suggests that a speaker employs `oh' to mark that he has undergone a change in his current state of knowledge, information, orientation, or awareness <ref> [6] </ref>. `Oh' can mark a selfinitiated repair, or it can come af ter claritcation, correction, or a response to a question [8].

In the Trains corpus, `so' turns provide conclusions, summaries, or restatements. When a restatement begins with `so', the listener does not expect the upcoming ut terance to build new information onto the emerging plan. `So' contrasts with `and' in interesting ways which are discussed in the next section. <p> Schiffrin discovered that using `and' actually makes a claim that the speaker does not wish to cooperate with a potential topic shift introduced by the other speaker's intervening turn <ref> [8] </ref>. Turninitial `and' sends a strong sig nal that the current turn continues to build on information from the same speaker's prior speech. Look again at the example from dialog 10.3 in section 2.5. In utt31, the `system' summarizes the plan and states the current time.
