Reference-contexts: The expansion of an embedding f is the ratio of the number of vertices of H to the number of vertices of G. Since we use injective mappings in this paper, the expansion of all embeddings will be at least one. The star and pancake graphs were proposed in <ref> [1] </ref> as a topology for interconnecting processors in large scale parallel computers. These graphs belong to the family of Cayley graphs [3], a family of graphs obtained from representations of groups, and they have very many interesting properties [1]. In particular, they are vertex transitive. <p> The star and pancake graphs were proposed in <ref> [1] </ref> as a topology for interconnecting processors in large scale parallel computers.

The star graph S n and pancake graph P n of dimension n are graphs whose vertex set consists of all permutations of f1; 2; : : : ; ng.

Reference-contexts: Section 6 contains the conclusions and a table that summarizes our results. 2 Embeddings of dilation 1 We begin with a simple result given in <ref> [4] </ref> with a different proof. Our proof is not as simple as the original one, but it can be easily adapted to obtain the same result for pancake graphs. The result will be used in the proof of our main theorem on the dilation 1 embeddings of complete binary trees.

Reference-contexts: In Section 5 we show that the constructions of dilation 1 and 2ffi, ffi 1 from Sections 2, 3, and 4 can be also applied for constructing embeddings of complete binary trees into pancake graphs, and more generally into recursively decomposable Cayley graphs (see <ref> [5] </ref> for the definition). Section 6 contains the conclusions and a table that summarizes our results. 2 Embeddings of dilation 1 We begin with a simple result given in [4] with a different proof. <p> Thus, these constructions could be adjusted to any family of recursively decomposable Cayley graphs as defined in <ref> [5] </ref>. 20 A recursively decomposable Cayley graph is a Cayley graph which satisfies the following conditions : * its vertex set is the set of all permutations on n symbols, for some integer n 2. * its generator set is a set of n permutations g 1 ; g 2 ;

Reference-contexts: Given ffi, determine the maximum number of nodes of a a complete binary tree that can be embedded into S n (or P n ) with dilation ffi. Another interesting question is to study the congestion of these embeddings. This problem was considered in <ref> [6] </ref>. 22
