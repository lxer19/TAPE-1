Abstract: When applying Inductive Logic Programming techniques in real-world settings, many problems will come up. The project was done in co-operation with Hogdalenverket, a heat and power plant burning household refuse in the Stockholm area, Sweden. The application problems with collecting data and the application of ILP-techniques are discussed. Results of tests performed while using SPECTRE, an ILP-algorithm developed at Stockholm University, are reported. These results show that the addition of background knowledge and addition/retraction of parameters has positive effect on the performance of the ILP-techniques. After initial tests a knowledge acquisition stage was started. This resulted in knowledge about the domain that was used for evaluating the results of learning using SPECTRE. This prevented several mistakes by interpreting data and evaluating performance. This knowledge was partly used as background knowledge for the learning algorithm. Noise handling was applied and increased the efficiency of the SPECTRE-algorithm. The paper compares the performance of the SPECTRE-algorithm on theoretical databases with the performance on this practical domain.

Reference-contexts: Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is used for learning in the domain. Few real-world applications using ILP are available for evaluation. The algorithm used for this application is called SPECTRE 2 and is developed at the Stockholm Univer sity <ref> [1] </ref>. Interviews at the plant and knowledge available from reports etc. were taken into consideration. <p> / Fax: +49-721-693 717 1 Due to space constraints, a full version of this paper is published in the Proceedings of the Workshop on Intelligent Adaptive Systems, Melbourne Beach, Florida, 1995 2 SPECialization by TRansformation and Elimination 2 Using ILP-techniques: the SPECTRE algorithm The ILP-technique used was the SPECTRE algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>. This algorithm is based on the idea of finding an inductive hypothesis through the specialization of a logic program. The program has as input a logic program, a set of negative examples and a set of positive examples. <p> In SPECTRE an SLD-tree is pruned in order to search for a hypothesis. Bostrom and Idestam Almquist give a more extensive discussion on SPECTRE as well as the results of running SPECTRE on other domains <ref> [1] </ref>. In the current project these experiments will be extended by research involving the application of the SPECTRE algorithm on a real-world domain (See section 3). 3 The industrial setting: Hogdalenverket The domain which was evaluated consist of instances of the target clause T. <p> The tests were performed in the same way as the evaluation of the SPECTRE-algorithm mentioned in <ref> [1] </ref>. The background knowledge that is collected is included in the testing. The tests evaluate the effects of the removing of literals and the addition of domain knowledge on accuracy. Redefinition of the general theory was done which included the addition of some intermediate predicates according to the gathered models.

Reference-contexts: Many practical domains however are represented numerically. Several authors recognize these and other kinds of (representational) problems (see for example [8], <ref> [2] </ref>). The parameters in the logged data can be subject to noise. The parameters that cause the effects are not measured simultaneously. There always is a delay. The 5 minute averages are taken instead of the 10-second loggings while this approach filters out most of the delay effects. <p> Evaluating the project, it can be stated that using inductive learning algorithms on real-world domains without any knowledge acquisition process is not very helpful. As mentioned in <ref> [2] </ref> applying machine learning algorithms on "raw" data extracted from a database is of limited benefit. Our experience supports this point of view and we expect much benefit from the knowledge elicitation and representational redescription processes as described in [2]. <p> As mentioned in <ref> [2] </ref> applying machine learning algorithms on "raw" data extracted from a database is of limited benefit.

The next stages of the project will include some further testing on newly provided data from Hogdalenverket and testing the Hogdalen domain with the MOBAL-system [10].

Reference-contexts: Most ILP-systems can be used with different quantities and qualities of background knowledge. Adding background knowledge to the specialization problem has the advantage that the search process can be biased to raise the efficiency of the search process (see [11], [7], [5], [13], <ref> [3] </ref> ). When databases grow larger this topic becomes of more interest. Background knowledge can be elicited performing Knowledge Acquisition and is normally represented in a symbolical form (This is one of the reasons for our approach to represent the example symbolical as well).

Reference-contexts: the apparent possibility of improvement by simply finding control rules for the (already available) equipment and through the availability of already logged data it was seen as an attractive possibility to evaluate the SPECTRE algorithm in this domain. 3 M P 0 denotes the least Hebrand model as described in <ref> [6] </ref> The fact that the data were not represented purely symbolically, but numerical was problematic in the sense that few approaches are reported trying to integrate numerically and symbolical representation for use with ILP-techniques. Many practical domains however are represented numerically.

Focussing is found a useful process in the stage of learning from databases ( <ref> [7] </ref> for more on this topic). Interviews and reports resulted in a preliminary model of the processes involved and their connections. Partly this knowledge was selected to provide knowledge implemented in the form of intermediate predicates, were another part of this knowledge was used to focus the data.

As mentioned before, it is also the intention to model and add more background knowledge in the course of the project.
