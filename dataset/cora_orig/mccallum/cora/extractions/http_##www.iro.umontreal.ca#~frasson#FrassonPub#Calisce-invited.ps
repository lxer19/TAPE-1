Abstract: Industrial training needs to be improved as employees are faced with a rapid change in their knowledge environment and their responsibilities. Instructional design was often considered as a keypoint of knowledge transfer but the outcomes in terms of cost and efficiency depend greatly on how the design is realized and how the employees can efficiently use the learning material. In the SAFARI project, which aims at developing various components of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), cooperation with industry led us to deliver gradual tutoring systems that correspond to different real needs. Lessons learned from this experience highlight some realistic aspects of training in industry and allow to consider instructional design according to a new point of view.

Reference-contexts: However, industrial training is time consuming and expensive. For instance, IBM US spends $2 billion a year on training including $1 billion for trainers salaries; each year, the US government spends $20 billion on military training <ref> [1] </ref>. To this costs one should add the cost of stopping production tasks, pulling the employee out of the workplace during training sessions. Updating existing courses is also long and expensive as very few real database systems are used to store and maintain the courses.

Reference-contexts: The main objectives of SAFARI <ref> [2] </ref> are to develop a methodology and an environment for the creation of tutoring systems to be used in professional formation. The focus is on teaching mostly procedural knowledge concerning the operation of devices such as medical instrumentation, consumer appliances and aeronautical instruments.

Reference-contexts: The learner controls his activity (for example, the resolution of a task) and this mode can be compared with free navigation within a hypermedia document, advice: the learner is in a problem solving situation and can benefit from advice of an adviser <ref> [3] </ref> who continually watches the tasks and can correct the actions with in depth explanations. Various types of guidance (on demand, automatic, with multiple explanations,...) can be obtained, curriculum: the learner enters in a learning session, through a complete course with problems, exercises and evaluation of different activities.

Reference-contexts: The course is given using a variety of learning strategies that can be selected according to the learners model. In the first three situations instructional design will be restricted to editing problems solving situations. The last mode has two important characteristics 1. The course derives from a curriculum <ref> [4] </ref> which is organized according to a network of knowledge transitions based on capabilities (according to Gagne [5]), instructional objectives and pedagogical resources (learning materials). Achievement of instructional objectives contributes to the acquisition of capabilities. <p> Objectives are linked using three kinds of relations: prerequisite, pretext (if an objective can contribute to the achievement of another objective), and component (if an objective contains several sub-objectives). Resources represent the way to support learning ( exercise, problem, simulation, demonstration, document,...). A course <ref> [4] </ref> is a structured set containing three categories of objectives: global, specific and terminal objectives. <p> The organization of the curriculum <ref> [4] </ref> into three networks with predetermined links, as indicated above, allows a generic approach that transforms the role of the designer. He now has only to specify the knowledge he wants to teach by selecting a set of objectives, supervising the process and approving or not the generated course.

Reference-contexts: Several learning strategies are provided to improve learner knowledge acquisition. According to the characteristics of the learner [6] (learning style, knowledge level) which result from the interaction with the tutoring system, a learning strategy is selected. These strategies can be carried out by different tutoring agents <ref> [7] </ref> called actors 2 that can play different roles according to the conditions of learning. These conditions are determined by the learner's actions which are analyzed and stored in the learner's model. An architecture based on actors has been determined in [7]. <p> strategies can be carried out by different tutoring agents <ref> [7] </ref> called actors 2 that can play different roles according to the conditions of learning.

Reference-contexts: For instance, we distinguish the following pedagogical actors: a tutor who gives a course according to a prescriptive approach, a co-learner who is a simulated learner with approximately the same level of knowledge than the learner, a companion, a simulated learner [8]who can give advice, the inverted tutor <ref> [9] </ref> played by the tutor who is waiting for explanations from the learner, the troublemaker [10], a particular companion who can randomly give true of false advice. Unlike the companion, the knowledge of the troublemaker is quite superior to that of the real student.

Reference-contexts: Unlike the companion, the knowledge of the troublemaker is quite superior to that of the real student. A first experiment (learning of highway code) has shown that the troublemaker becomes efficient for advanced students <ref> [11] </ref>. The originality of our approach in building a generic ITS is to allow the use of multiple learning strategies.

Reference-contexts: We represent this state as a vector whose elements are couples (capacity, level of mastery). We think that a good cognitive analysis of a domain can allow to identify and to classify categories of students with a more precise idea on their knowledge. The process of course generation <ref> [12] </ref> consists in considering these two parameters, and use the structures of the curricula to lead to a reasoning that will allow to define a course which is relevant for the concerned public (figure 1).
