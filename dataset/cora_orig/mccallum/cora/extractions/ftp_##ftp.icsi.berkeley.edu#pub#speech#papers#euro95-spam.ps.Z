Abstract: We have recently developed a statistical model of speech that focuses statistical modeling power on phonetic transitions. These are the perceptually-dominant and information-rich portions of the speech signal, which may also be the parts of the speech signal with a better chance to withstand adverse acoustical conditions. We describe here some of the concepts, along with some preliminary experiments on digit recognition. These experiments show that the new models, when used in combination with our more standard models, can significantly improve performance in the presence of noise.

Reference-contexts: In principle, this probability can be estimated by a neural network trained with targets associated with Avent labels (or Avent probabilities, as in <ref> [1] </ref>), and with inputs representing the previous Avent, the time back to that Avent, and a local window of acoustic vectors. For the purposes of this paper, we have only implemented the system with acoustic inputs, so that we are actually eval uating p (q n nd ): (2) 2. <p> EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Theoretical work has continued in the form of new training procedures for transition-based systems, and is reported elsewhere (see <ref> [1] </ref>). This summary is, however, intended to report work in progress in incorporating SPAMs in a word recognition system, namely one for classifying digits and simple control words spoken in isolation over the telephone. <p> However, we viewed it as a reasonable first attempt. In later systems we intend to train frames with continuous probabilities of being a state transition as learned by the REMAP procedure <ref> [1] </ref>. As noted above, for the experiments reported in this paper we did not learn a conditional dependence between the previous Avent or the time between a current frame and the previous Avent, although these terms are proposed in the SPAM theory [5]. <p> We had difficulty with training the Avent/non-Avent network, and were forced to subsample the data, leading to probabilities that were skewed from the true posteriors we wished to estimate. This problem could be greatly reduced using results from REMAP research <ref> [1] </ref>, since many frames would have some nonzero probability of being an Avent. Finally, as yet we have not incorporated any new signal processing that might be helpful in estimating Avent probabilities; we are currently relying on RASTA-PLP.

Reference-contexts: Discriminant models are trained to distinguish among all classes (including the non-Avent class). In the full embedded procedure, the training data is automatically aligned using dynamic programming, and the discriminant system (e.g., a neural network) is trained on the new segmentation. These two steps are iterated, as discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>, and are guaranteed to converge to a local minimum of the probability of error (on the training set). <p> This latter net was then used to initialize the net that discriminated between Avents which for the purposes of this experiment can be viewed as left-context-dependent phonetic onsets. A second net was trained for phone discrimination according to our established hybrid procedure <ref> [2] </ref>, using 200 hidden units and the same input features and training data.

Reference-contexts: In the new model, speech was viewed from the perceiving side as a sequence of Auditory Events (Avents), which are elementary decisions that occur at some point when the spectrum and amplitude are rapidly changing (as in <ref> [3] </ref>). Avents are presumed to occur about once per phone boundary, and thus are modeled as being separated by relatively stationary periods (ca. 50-150 ms). The statistical model uses these Avents as fundamental building blocks for words and utterances, separated by states corresponding to the more stationary regions.

Reference-contexts: In some cases good models can be developed for the interfering noise, but more generally it would be desirable to build systems that were inherently resistant to degradation from unknown additive non-speech sounds. Both systems that were reported here, i.e., phone-based and Avent-based, used J-RASTA processing <ref> [4] </ref>, which in fact gave us significant robustness to the added noise due to its emphasis on transitional information. An earlier experiment using log-RASTA, which was less well-suited to the noisy situation, showed over three times the error rate.
