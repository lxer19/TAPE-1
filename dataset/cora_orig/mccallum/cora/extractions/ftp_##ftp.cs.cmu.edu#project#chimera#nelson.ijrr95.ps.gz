Abstract: An eye-in-hand system visually tracking objects can fail when the manipulator encounters a kinematic singularity or a joint limit. A solution to this problem is presented in which objects are visually tracked while the manipulator simultaneously avoids kinematic singularities and manipulator joint limits by moving in directions along which the tracking task space is unconstrained or redundant. A manipulability measure is introduced into the visual tracking objective function, providing an elegant and robust technique for deriving a control law that visually tracks objects while accounting for the configuration of the manipulator. Two different tracking strategies, one using a standard visual tracking strategy and the other using the newly proposed strategy, are experimentally compared on an actual hand/eye system. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method by showing that the tracking region of a manipulator tracking objects with planar motion can be greatly increased.

Reference-contexts: Feature Tracking The measurement of the motion of the features on the image plane must be done continuously and quickly. The method used to measure this motion is based on optical ow techniques and is a modification of the method proposed in <ref> (Anandan 1987) </ref>. This technique is known as a Sum-of-Squares-Differences (SSD) optical ow, and is based on the assumption that the intensities around a feature point remain constant as that point moves across the image plane.

Reference-contexts: For example, (Nelson and Khosla 1992) presents a hybrid control structure which uses an unconstrained tracking axis for singularity avoidance. If one uses the task function approach for visual servoing <ref> (Espiau, Chaumette and Rives 1992) </ref>, the manipulability measure presented in (26) could be introduced as a secondary task function, also resulting in a hybrid strategy.

Reference-contexts: To model the 3-D visual tracking problem, we assume a pinhole model for the camera with a frame -C- placed at the focal point of the lens as shown in Figure 2 <ref> (Gremban, Thorpe and Kanade 1988) </ref>. A feature on an object at P 1 with coordinates (X o ,Y o ,Z o ) in the camera frame projects onto the cameras image plane by the equations for 1.

Reference-contexts: By explicitly calculating from (3) and determining the projection of on the image plane using (1) and (2), the camera induced optical ow of the point P can be determined to be, assuming for the moment that the object is stationary, <ref> (Horn 1986) </ref> The optical ow that can actually be observed on the image plane, however, is due to both the optical ow induced by camera motion (u c ,v c ) and the optical ow induced by object motion (u o ,v o ).

Reference-contexts: The elements of d F are due to optical ow terms that are induced by unknown object motion. It is possible to use predictive techniques based on recently observed object motion to estimate d F , as in <ref> (Kalata 1992) </ref>. It is common in regulator theory, however, to simply assume that unknown signals to be tracked are considered disturbances to be suppressed. Past work has shown that this is a reasonable assumption for the visual tracking problem (Papanikolopoulos, Khosla and Kanade 1991).

Reference-contexts: This is because (a) the path of the object being tracked is not known a priori, so the manipulators path may not be planned in advance to avoid singularities as proposed in (Uchiyama, Shimizu and Hakomori 1985), and (b) pseudo-inverse and singularity-robust inverse <ref> (Nakamura and Hanafusa 1986) </ref> or damped least-squares methods (Wampler 1986) of cartesian control allow motion to continue near and even at singularities by approximation of the cartesian path, but the loss of movement in one or more directions still exists and higher than usual joint velocities may occur. <p> In (Egeland, Ebdrup and Chiaverini 1990), the damped least-squares method proposed by both <ref> (Nakamura and Hanafusa 1986) </ref> and (Wampler 1986) is extended to create a cartesian controller for visual servo-ing that operates well in the presence of internal singularities. The authors use a damping factor 11 derived from an estimate of the smallest singular value of the manipulator Jacobian.

Reference-contexts: For robust tracking, axes of motion whose eigenvalues are mainly dependent on image coordinates are poor choices for the tracking strategy. In <ref> (Nelson and Khosla 1994) </ref>, a tracking measure called resolvability is introduced which provides a technique for measuring the relative ability of different camera-lens-manipulator configurations to precisely visually servo objects held by a manipulator. This same measure can be used for eye-in-hand systems.

Reference-contexts: Thus, in general, the number of states must be at least as great as the number of desired control inputs. It is also necessary that the matrix expression is of full rank. In <ref> (Papanikolopoulos and Khosla 1993) </ref>, conditions which can cause (18) to lose rank due to particular feature locations on the image plane are discussed. The axes of camera motion which are controlled in order to track the object can vary depending on the requirements of the task.

Reference-contexts: Measures of Manipulability In order to avoid singularities and joint limits, a measure must be determined in order to compare different manipulator configurations. Several researchers have proposed several different manipulability measures. One of the first measures proposed was used to evaluate the working region of a manipulator wrist <ref> (Paul and Stevenson 1983) </ref>, which was considered to be all wrist configurations satisfying where J is the Jacobian of the wrist and q is the vector of joint angles.
