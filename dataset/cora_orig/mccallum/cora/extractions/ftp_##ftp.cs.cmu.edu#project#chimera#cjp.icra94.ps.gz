Abstract: The application of robots in critical missions in hazardous environments requires the development of reliable or fault tolerant manipulators. In this paper, we define fault tolerance as the ability to continue the performance of a task after immobilization of a joint due to failure. Initially, no joint limits are considered, in which case we prove the existence of fault tolerant manipulators and develop an analysis tool to determine the fault tolerant work space. We also derive design templates for spatial fault tolerant manipulators. When joint limits are introduced, analytic solutions become infeasible but instead a numerical design procedure can be used, as is illustrated through an example. Lewis and Maciejewski [11], on the other hand, discuss the importance of the controller and the redundancy resolution algorithm. In this paper, the focus is on kinematic design of fault tolerant manipulators. To set the stage for our development, we define the following properties of fault tolerant manipulators [1]: k-Reduced Order Derivative (k-ROD): When joints of an -DOF manipulator fail, the effective number of joints is . The resulting faulty manipulator is called a -reduced order derivative. Order of Fault Tolerance: An -DOF manipulator is FT of the -th order, if and only if all possible -reduced order derivatives can still perform the specified task. We call the manipulator -fault tol erant. These definitions differ from the concept of fault tolerance as proposed by Maciejewski [12]. Instead of attributing the property of fault tolerance to a manipulator, he quantifies a measure of fault tolerance for a manipulator posture and describes a technique to determine the optimal FT posture, based on the singular value decomposition of the Jacobian matrix. If a joint fails in this optimal posture, the resulting reduced order derivative will have maximum possible dexterity. However, a failure at a different angle may make the execution of the task impossible. k n k-( )

Reference-contexts: level III. 3.2: Boundary of the fault tolerant work space In this section, we show that a boundary point of the FTWS is a critical value (A critical value is an end-effector position that can be reached in a singular configuration, i.e., that is the image of a critical point <ref> [2] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: For this class of problems, the Newton-Raphson scheme (or Gauss-Newton algorithm) converges slowly and is outperformed by the BFGS algorithm (Broyden-Fletcher-Gold-farb-Shanno [5]). As shown by Fletcher and Xu <ref> [4] </ref>, the best overall performance is obtained by a hybrid algorithm, which combines the advantages of both the Gauss-Newton and BFGS algorithms. The second optimization in Equation (6) is the maximization over the frozen joint angle, . A typical example of the objective function is shown in Figure 6.

Reference-contexts: A second part, penalizes the joint limit violations. This penalty is equal to . (8) The resulting minimization of the full penalty function, is a nonlinear least squares (NLLS) problem, and is commonly solved in robotics applications using a Newton-Raphson scheme <ref> [6] </ref> (cfr. numerical inverse kinematics literature). This scheme converges very quickly when the penalty at the optimum is zero, i.e., for a zero residual NLLS problem.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that such a manipulator can be found by using the task based design approach described in <ref> [8] </ref> or [13]. An obvious way to make this manipulator FT is to design every joint with a redundant actuator. If one of the actuators of the resulting -DOF FT manipulator were to fail, the redundant actuator could take over and the manipulator would still be functional.

Reference-contexts: The third and outermost optimization minimizes the total penalty of a kinematic configuration, defined by the D-H parameters. Unfortunately, this function also has multiple minima. Therefore, we need to employ a global optimization method, such as simulated annealing. Simulated annealing was first proposed as a combinatorial optimization algorithm <ref> [9] </ref>, but can be easily adapted to continuously varying optimization variables. The method is basically a random iterative improvement algorithm with the modification that, under certain conditions, an increase in the objective function is accepted. A new trial configuration is generated randomly in the neighborhood of the current configuration.

Reference-contexts: The key observation is that when the desired point is outside the reach of the manipulator, the innermost minimization algorithm always gets stuck at the boundary of the work spaces of the manipulator, where the Jacobian matrix of the manipulator loses rank <ref> [10] </ref>. The measure of isotropy, , is defined as [7]: , (9) with the number of Cartesian coordinates. For a singular Jacobian, is zero; otherwise it is positive. Consequently, a minimization over leads to regions where the penalty is possibly positive.
