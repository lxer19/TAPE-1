Abstract: This paper sets out a conceptual framework for the open-ended artificial evolution of complex behaviour in autonomous agents. If recurrent dynamical neural networks (or similar) are used as phenotypes, then a Genetic Algorithm that employs variable length genotypes, such as Inman Harvey's SAGA, is capable of evolving arbitrary levels of be-havioural complexity. Furthermore, with simple restrictions on the encoding scheme that governs how genotypes develop into phenotypes, it may be guaranteed that if an increase in fitness requires an increase in be-havioural complexity, then it will evolve. In order for this process to be practicable as a design alternative, however, the time periods involved must be acceptable. The final part of this paper looks at general ways in which the encoding scheme may be modified to speed up the process. Experiments are reported in which different categories of scheme were tested against each other, and conclusions are offered as to the most promising type of encoding scheme for a vi able open-ended Evolutionary Robotics.

Reference-contexts: If we are after an open-ended evolutionary process that is truly limitless in terms of the behaviour complexity it is capable of producing, therefore, we cannot rely on traditional GA optimization techniques. In <ref> [4] </ref>, Inman Harvey offers a straight-forward way of literally extending traditional GA models for the purposes of open-ended artificial evolution. He proposes a Species Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (SAGA) which differs from a conventional GA in two crucial respects.

Reference-contexts: ER must be able to produce satisfactory results within a reasonable time period. This is by no means the only matter on which the viability of an open-ended ER rests (see <ref> [7] </ref> for issues involving real robots) but it is certainly a necessary and pressing requirement.

Reference-contexts: Either we bias the encoding scheme so that there are lots of ways in which genotypes may code for p phenotypes but only a 3 The biological analogue of this phenomena is known as Muller's Ratchet (see <ref> [8] </ref>). This might be one area in which artificial evolution may effortlessly improve on Natural Evolution. In both experiment 1 (top pair) and experiment 2 (bottom pair), any phenotype matching the left hand template was assigned a fitness of 1.0.

Reference-contexts: All nodes will connect to at least a few other nodes of the same corresponding fitness thus forming large neutral networks (the term here is adapted from its use in <ref> [10] </ref>). In every neutral network there will be one or more nodes that also has an up-hill connection to a node in a neutral network of higher fitness.

Reference-contexts: If recurrent dynamical neural networks <ref> [11] </ref> or something similarly suitable are used as phenotypes, then this makes it possible, at least as far as the evolutionary process is concerned, to produce arbitrarily complex behaviours.

Reference-contexts: If there is a global fitness maximum in the fitness landscape, then we require that the evolutionary process eventually finds it, and where the fitness landscape is continually changing, as might be the case in a coevolutionary scenario for instance <ref> [12] </ref>, we require that the population continues to adapt ad infinitum. This property of the evolutionary process, here referred to as open-endedness, is logically equivalent to the population never becoming `stuck' on a local fitness maximum in the fitness landscape 1 .

Reference-contexts: A hybrid restricted scheme would encode a single leg once on a genotype and reuse this code 1000 times. Perhaps it would also code for a small number of position dependent operators, such that the front legs differed from the back legs according to some spatial transformation (see <ref> [13] </ref> for examples of this sort of thing occurring in nature). A true biased encoding scheme, on the other hand, must safeguard the possibility that any leg may evolve independently to any other, since every phenotype is potentially representable.
