Reference-contexts: Most of this work has been done with the assumption of static cannel filters and higher order statistics has mostly been used in order to estimate the mixing coefficients. Recently, algorithms using only second order statistics have been presented <ref> [1, 5, 9] </ref>. In the present paper a criterion using second order statistics is used, formulated for two dimensional signals (images) and two dimensional dynamical channel filters (ie. filters with memory). Only a few papers have been published with the application of signal separation to images, see eg. [3, 7]. <p> coefficients b 1 (i; j) of the filter B 1 (z 1 ; z 2 ) = B 1 X B 1 B 1 X B 1 1 z 2 : (2.2) This scenario is, for one dimensional signals and fil-ters, referred to as the signal separation problem (see e.g. <ref> [1, 4, 9] </ref>). In order to extract two uncorrelated images, s 1 and s 2 , from the observed images, y 1 and y 2 , the separation structure in figure 1b is introduced.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Blind signal separation (for one dimensional signals) is an intensive area of research. The algorithms are blind in the sense that no knowledge of the signals is available, except the plausible assumption of uncorrelated signals. Many algorithms to solve this problem has been presented (see eg <ref> [4, 8, 9] </ref>) in the past years. Most of this work has been done with the assumption of static cannel filters and higher order statistics has mostly been used in order to estimate the mixing coefficients. Recently, algorithms using only second order statistics have been presented [1, 5, 9]. <p> coefficients b 1 (i; j) of the filter B 1 (z 1 ; z 2 ) = B 1 X B 1 B 1 X B 1 1 z 2 : (2.2) This scenario is, for one dimensional signals and fil-ters, referred to as the signal separation problem (see e.g. <ref> [1, 4, 9] </ref>).

Compare <ref> [5] </ref> where a similar analysis is done, but for causal and one dimensional filters.
