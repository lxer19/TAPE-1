Abstract: The increasing development of machine learning lattice based systems faces a hard problem due to the lattice construction itself. This part have an exponential time and space complexity which overlaps the rest in the system complexity. We focussed our interest on Galois lattice which is lattice that builds maximal similarities over a binary relation between two sets. In this paper, a polynomial time parallel algorithm (in the number of columns and lines in the matrix relation table) to build Galois lattice is proposed. This algorithm is based on the same idea as Bordat's sequential one.

Reference-contexts: Our approach is based on a sequential algorithm for Galois lattice construction (Bordat) used by several ML systems such as LEGAL [7] for concepts formation. The reasons of this choice come from the fact that Bordat's algorithm <ref> [2] </ref> needs as input a matrix table and proceeds by selecting lattice-nodes according to a FIFO (First In First Out) ordered list. For the current node, only a sub-matrix table is considered and its sub-nodes in construction are inserted in the list. <p> of all nodes has the mathematical structure of a complete lattice (i.e. two nodes of the lattice have a common super-node and a common sub-node) and is called the Galois lat tice L (C) of the context C. 2.2 A sequential algorithm We present the sequential algorithm proposed by Bordat <ref> [2] </ref> to build a Galois lattice. Other sequential algorithms for non-incremental construction of Ga-lois lattice were reported (for example see [8]) among which only Bordat's one integrated the order relation between nodes. Recently two incremental algorithms have been published ([3],[6]) which use different approaches to build the lattice.

Reference-contexts: Galois lattice, also termed "concept lattice" [10], is a mathematical framework that allows to build embedded classes from a set of objects. The main difficulty with Galois lattice-based system comes from the lattice construction itself <ref> [5] </ref>. The useful exhaustiveness of Galois lattice, when representing the concepts hierarchy, gives an exponential increase of the lattice size according to the data. Some ML systems, such as LEGAL [7], reduced their target to the construction of a join semi-lattice. <p> An upper bound for the lattice size complexity jLj is 2 min (n;m) , with n = jOj and m = jAj <ref> [5] </ref>. Consider L 2 = f (X; Y ) 2 L 2 ; X Y g. jL 2 j is the number of edges in the lattice (jLj jL 2 j).

Reference-contexts: However, the computational complexity remains exponential, thus it is hard to deal with such system in practice. With the development of new architectures in computer science which integrates more than one processor, parallelism increasingly becomes a new interesting research topic <ref> [9] </ref>. We consider a parallel program as a collection of cooperating and communicating modules called tasks.
