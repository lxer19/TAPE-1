Title: On the Convergence of the Newton/Log-Barrier Method  
Author: Stephen Wright

Abstract: In the Newton/log-barrier method, Newton steps are taken for the log barrier function for a fixed value of the barrier parameter until a certain convergence criterion is satisfied. The barrier parameter is then decreased and the Newton process is repeated. A naive analysis indicates that Newton's method does not exhibit superlinear convergence to the minimizer of each instance of the log-barrier function until it reaches a very small neighborhood of the minimizer. By partitioning according to the subspace of active constraint gradients, however, we show that this neighborhood is actually quite large, thus explaining why reasonably fast local convergence can be attained in practice. Finally, we show that the overall convergence rate of the Newton/log-barrier algorithm is superlinear in the number of function/derivative evaluations, provided that the nonlinear program is formulated with a linear objective and the schedule for decreasing the barrier parameter is related in a certain way to the convergence criterion for each Newton process.

Then if s is the Newton direction for P (; ) from x, the line segment x + o (= )s, o 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is strictly feasible.

Often, however, steplengths of 1 can be taken safely after a few Newton iterations, yielding quadratic convergence toward x (). <p> In this paper, we show that this neighborhood is in fact not so small, suggesting that the number of Newton iterations required for each value of is not excessive. We conclude the paper by using earlier results of Wright and Jarre <ref> [6] </ref> to show that, when the objective function f is linear and the convergence test for the Newton iterations at each value of has a certain form, the number of Newton iterates required for each value can be bounded above by a modest number. <p> The following technical lemma, a consequence of the implicit function theorem, is proved in Wright and Jarre <ref> [6, Lemma 3.1] </ref>. Lemma 2.1 Let the vector pair (~x (z; i); ~ (z; i)) be defined implicitly as the solution of the nonlinear system F (~x; ~ ) = z # for given (z; i) and F defined as in (9). <p> Wright and Jarre <ref> [6] </ref> investigated the use of a reformulation of (1) in which the objective function is linear. <p> For background, we state a result due to Wright and Jarre <ref> [6] </ref>, which shows that when we have a sufficiently good approximation to the log-barrier minimizer x ( ) at the current barrier value , and we then reduce to (but not too rapidly), then the Newton step for P x (; ) passes quite close to the new minimizer x (). <p> Moreover, the steplength ff = = is asymptotically optimal. The result is a combination of Theorems 3.2 and 3.3 from <ref> [6] </ref>. Theorem 4.1 Suppose that f is linear and that the barrier parameter values and satisfy the condition 2 [ae min ~oe where ae min &gt; 0, ae max 2 (0; 1), and ~oe 2 (1; 2] are constants.
