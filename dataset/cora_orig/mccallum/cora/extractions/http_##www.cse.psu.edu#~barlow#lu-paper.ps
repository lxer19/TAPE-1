Abstract: This paper studies the solution of the linear least squares problem for a large and sparse m by n matrix A with m n by QR factorization of A and transformation of the right-hand side vector b to Q T b. A multifrontal-based method for computing Q T b using Householder factorization is presented. Some numerical results for the grid model problems as well as Harwell-Boeing problems are pro vided. 1.

Reference-contexts: An O (n log n) bound is proven on the number of nonzeros of all frontal Householder matrices Y i 's. We also count the number of nonzeros used in the WY representations of Bischof and Van Loan <ref> [5] </ref> and Schreiber and Van Loan [29]. We prove the bounds for the K by K grid model problem and problems which are defined on p n-separable graphs are O (n log n) and O (n (log n) 2 ), respectively. <p> This is because that in the grid model problem case, the ` term in the boundary of jT j is replaced by a lower order term based on the information from the separators.

Reference-contexts: We also solve the linear least squares problems given in (1) by QR method by [18] using our method for computing Q T b. We compare the QR method with the method of correct semi-normal equations method (CSNE) by <ref> [6] </ref>. The CSNE method 20 S.-M. LU AND J. L. BARLOW Table 3 Residuals for the model problem.

In this paper, we have provided a multifrontal-based method for storing Q and, thus, computing Q T b by using the frontal Householder matrices for an m by n large and sparse matrix with m n.

Reference-contexts: The factorization uses the frontal structure inherent in multifrontal Cholesky algorithms and Householder transformations. A theoretical operation count for the model problem is given by Lewis et.al.

The proof is similar to the one for the fill-in bound of Lipton, Rose, and Tarjan's work in <ref> [21] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: An O (n log n) bound is proven on the number of nonzeros of all frontal Householder matrices Y i 's. We also count the number of nonzeros used in the WY representations of Bischof and Van Loan [5] and Schreiber and Van Loan <ref> [29] </ref>. We prove the bounds for the K by K grid model problem and problems which are defined on p n-separable graphs are O (n log n) and O (n (log n) 2 ), respectively. <p> This section builds on the work of Lewis et.al. [20] for K by K grid problem. We extend their result to the p n-separator problem. Section 5 introduces BLAS-2 operations in computing Q T b by using the YTY representation of Schreiber and Van Loan <ref> [29] </ref> for the orthogonal factor Q i of each frontal matrix F i . The upper 6 S.-M. LU AND J. L. BARLOW bound on operation counts of that representation is also included. In section 6, we provide some numerical test results. 2. Background. 2.1. The Model Problem. <p> Introducing BLAS-2 Operations. In order to introduce BLAS-2 operations in (6), we use the YTY Representation <ref> [29] </ref>, also called the "storage-efficient WY-representation. <p> Moreover, our bounds will apply to the Bischof-Van Loan representation, but with slightly different constants. The YTY representation always requires less storage. In our experiments, the WY representation tended to compute Q T b somewhat faster, but that result varies among architectures <ref> [29] </ref>. 6. Numerical Results. In this section, we examine the performance of our method for computing Q T b and solve the linear least squares problem given in (1) by QR method using our method to compute Q T b.

Reference-contexts: The proposed method has possibilities for parallel computing as seen on the iPSC/2 [23]. In a future report, we will test different representations of the orthogonal factors on p n-separator matrices and various practical problems such as the geodesy problems [19] and the equilibrium systems problem <ref> [30] </ref> on advanced architectures which support BLAS-2 and BLAS-3 operations.
