Abstract: We have developed a novel algorithm for extracting concise 3-D surface models of a scene from real sensor data that can be used for virtual reality modeling of the world. Our algorithm produces an accurate and realistic description of a scene even in the presence of sensor noise, sparse data and incomplete scene descriptions. We have demonstrated order of magnitude reduction in the number of faces used to describe a scene using data from multibaseline omnidirectional stereo, structure from motion, and a light stripe range finder. The algorithm takes as input a surface mesh describing the scene and a co-registered image. It outputs a surface mesh with fewer vertices and faces to which the appearance of the scene is mapped. Our simplification and noise reduction algorithm is based on a segmentation of the input surface mesh into surface patches using a least squares fitting of planes. Simplification is achieved by extracting, approximating and triangulating the bound-aries between surface patches.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Modeling the world is necessary for many virtual reality applications including tele-robotics [9], tele-presence [3], flight simulation, and modeling of famous buildings and scenes for archiving, education and entertainment <ref> [1] </ref>. These applications immerse a viewer in a model of the world where the viewer is able to move around and sometimes interact with his surroundings. For the immersion to be complete and convincing the models of the world must be realistic and ren-dered in real time.

Reference-contexts: The well known solution for the surface normal is the corresponding image and (c) the surface mesh with its appearance mapped onto its faces. + = n x d+ t 2 6 eigenvector of the smallest eigenvalue of the inertia matrix of the points <ref> [2] </ref>. The best fit plane pass-es though the center of mass c of the points so . The partitioning of the mesh is initialized by creating a planar surface patch from the points defining each face in the mesh. <p> Scene simplification requires elimination of such redundancy in the points and faces used to represent the scene, so the redundant points in the chains must be eliminated. The redundancy in the wireframe can be eliminated by simplifying each chain using an iterative end point fitting algorithm in 3-D <ref> [2] </ref>. We have chosen the simplest form of the algorithm 9 with a fixed threshold and no post fitting because an optimal simplification is not needed for scene simplification motivated by appearance mapping.

Reference-contexts: The first processing stage the surface mesh must undergo is a partitioning into planar surface patches. We use a modified version of the segmentation algorithm for surface meshes presented in <ref> [7] </ref>. The segmentation proceeds by a global region growing process in which neighboring regions in the mesh are merged until a threshold on number of regions or total mesh error is passed.

Reference-contexts: The raw data set shown at the top of Figure 7 was generated using a multibaseline omnidirectional stereo system that produces cylindrical depth maps though stereo matching of 360 degree 17 panoramas <ref> [10] </ref>. A panorama of the scene is generated by acquiring a stream of images taken as the camera is rotated 360 degrees about its optical center. The image stream is composited in a serial fashion to produce a full 360 degree cylindrical panoramic image of the scene.

Reference-contexts: We choose the Delaunay triangulation of the image coordinates to construct the surface meshes shown in this paper because this triangulation scheme connects points that are nearest neighbors <ref> [13] </ref>. Connecting points that are near to each other in the image will connect points that are near to each other in 3-D unless there exists a large depth discontinuity between the points. <p> The simple 2-D polygons corresponding to each planar patch boundary can now be triangulated. We use a greedy algorithm to triangulate the interiors of these polygons that is tailored to produce regular triangular faces <ref> [13] </ref>. A pseudo-code description follows: Initialize the set T of all segments in the triangulation with the segments making up the boundary polygon. Create the set S of all possible segments in the triangulation by con-necting every point in the polygon to every other point.
