Reference-contexts: That means that D is reducible. 2 We remark that the above lemma is also an easy consequence of the fact that reducible 3-uniform hypergraphs are leaf patterns of trees, cf. Section 4. Once the connections with cographs are clarified it also follows from Lemma 1 of <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Considering graphs as 2-uniform hypergraphs, Definition 2 gives graph entropy as a special case. We remark that it is not difficult to see (cf. Lemma 3.1 in <ref> [3] </ref>) from this definition that the entropy of the complete graph, K n , equals the Shannon-entropy of the probability distribution involved: H (K n ; P ) = H (P ) = i=1 No such general formula is known, however, to express H (K (k) n ; P ) for

Reference-contexts: This generalization was based on a similar sub-additivity inequality for hypergraphs. (For another similar application of hypergraph entropy, see Korner and Marton [14].) In Korner and Marton [11], Csiszar, Korner, Lovasz, Marton, and Simonyi <ref> [4] </ref>, Korner, Simonyi, and Tuza [15] the conditions of equality in (1) were investigated. (These problems date back to Korner and Longo [10] where a special case of (1) already appears.) The results of these investigations showed that there are close connections between graph entropy and some classical concepts of combinatorics, <p> The question of Korner and Longo in [10] was to characterize those graphs G that satisfy equality in (1) with F = G (where G stands for the complementary graph of G) and every P . It was conjectured in [11] and proved in <ref> [4] </ref> that these graphs are exactly the perfect graphs.

Our aim here is to characterize strongly splitting k-uniform hypergraphs for k 3. The main result is Theorem 1 of the next section that gives this characterization for k = 3. <p> For a hypergraph F let us denote the set of all maximal vectors in V P (F ) by V P 0 (F ). The following lemma is an immediate consequence of Corollary 7 in <ref> [4] </ref>. Lemma A For every a 2 V P 0 (F ) there exists a probability distribution P such that H (F; P ) = i=1 p i log a i . <p> Furthermore, if no p i = 0 for this P then a is the unique minimizing vector in the definition of H (F; P ). The following lemma is also not new (cf. [10], [11], <ref> [4] </ref> Corollary 10, [15] Lemma 3), but since it is easy, we give a short proof for the sake of clarity. <p> But now we assumed we have a k 1-element independent set with positive coefficient in the representation of a. Since the latter two have too small an intersection, we have arrived to a contradiction. The proof is now complete. 2 Theorem 2 of <ref> [4] </ref> together with our Theorems 1 and 2 implies the following Corollary 2 If a k-uniform hypergraph F is strongly splitting then (at least) one of the following three statements should hold: (i) k = 2 and F is a perfect graph (ii) k = 3 and F is a reducible
