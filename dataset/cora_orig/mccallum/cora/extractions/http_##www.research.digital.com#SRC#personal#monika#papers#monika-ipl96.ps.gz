Reference-contexts: To see this, consider a graph of two vertices joined by k paths of n=k vertices each. The minimum cut is of size 2, but there are (n=k) k cuts of size k. Recently, Karger <ref> [1] </ref> has informed us that he can almost prove the conjecture; namely, he can show that there are O ( 1 * n k1 ) cuts of size less than k 2 * times the optimal for * &lt; 1 2 .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently there have been a number of efforts to bound the number of nearly minimum cuts in a weighted undirected graph. Karger and Stein <ref> [2] </ref> show that there are at most n 2ff cuts of size no more than ff times the size of the minimum cut, where n is the number of vertices in the graph.

Reference-contexts: Karger and Stein [2] show that there are at most n 2ff cuts of size no more than ff times the size of the minimum cut, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. Nagamochi, Nishimura, and Ibaraki <ref> [3] </ref> provide an improvement on this result by showing that if the size of the minimum cut is , then there are at most n cuts of size strictly less than 4 3 .
