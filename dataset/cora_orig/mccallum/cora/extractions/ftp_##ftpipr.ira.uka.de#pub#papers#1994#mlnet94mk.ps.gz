Abstract: This paper describes methodologies applied and results achieved in the framework of the ESPRIT Basic Research Action B-Learn II (project no. 7274). B-Learn II is one of the first projects working towards an application of Machine Learning techniques in fields of industrial relevance, which are much more complex than the domains usually treated in ML research. In particular, B-Learn II aims at easing the programming of robots and enhancing their ability to cooperate with humans. The paper gives a short introduction to learning in robotics and to the three applications under consideration in B-Learn II. Afterwards, some examples of learning methodologies employed and results achieved in B-Learn II are presented, and the original references for the work going on in B-Learn II are given. A more thorough description of B-Learn II can be found in [22].

Reference-contexts: However, the second one opens the field for prediction of deviation of quality, enhancing the commonly used methodologies. Prediction of faults can become an important issue as an effective technique aimed at operating in run time and not based on an a posteriori analysis of samples <ref> [1, 45] </ref>. To build a suitable model of the machining process, it is necessary to identify a set of low-level building blocks (process steps). These blocks are commonly called machining features [43].

Reference-contexts: Second, means are necessary to detect the beginning and the end of a phase. Both tasks can be solved by means of function approximation techniques such as neural networks or fuzzy controllers <ref> [3, 17, 19, 18, 40] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: While errors can relatively easily be detected by the user himself on the task level, it is almost impossible to classify single control inputs as good or bad. Usually, only the complete execution can be evaluated safely, resulting in a scenario which is typical for reinforcement learning <ref> [4] </ref>. example of an operation requiring continuous control. comprising the skills of hole detection, alignment, and insertion. Consider the peg-into-hole operation, a typical task for a manipulation robot. Below the level of the elementary operation "peg-into-hole", individual skills build in fact the whole operation.

Reference-contexts: These aspects give a strong evidence for the necessity of learning components that must be integrated parts of the system <ref> [42, 13] </ref>. Summarizing, the architecture of an autonomous mobile robot must contain performance components, such as planning modules, but it must also incorporate learning capabilities such as the incremental generation and improvement of motoric skills, or extraction of symbolic knowledge about the world from sensory data.

PRIAMOS is a mobile system with three degrees of freedom, i.e. motion in longitudinal and transverse direction and rotation around the center of the vehicle. This is accomplished by the use of four Mecanum wheels, each one driven separately.

Reference-contexts: As figure 5 shows, the segmentation of a given example results in a sequence of phases. This sequence can be employed as an example to be used to induce the structure of the task (see also <ref> [15] </ref>). Following the segmentation of the set of available examples, the control functions taking care of the individual segments, i.e., the skills controlling the several phases of the task are to be learned. This task comprises two different aspects.

Reference-contexts: The main conclusion that can be drawn from an analysis of the application of Machine Learning to Robotics is that a successful employment of learning techniques on all levels of robot control is not possible without deeply revising the design criteria that are usually underlying the robot control system <ref> [28, 25] </ref>. In particular, it is necessary to identify both the tasks of the learning system and the tasks of the robot first and to design an architecture being able to host both the learning and the performance components afterwards. <p> The individual skills building the whole operation correspond to these phases. The actual procedure to generate an operational description of a skill comprises several steps <ref> [25] </ref>. Some of these steps (see also figure 4) involve the acquisition of new or the modification of existing knowledge or its representation. <p> The symbolic representation, however, requires clustering and the definition of a concept describing the covered situations. Since the semantics of the performed operation and, consequently, of the situations cannot be derived from the numerical examples, is must be provided externally <ref> [25] </ref>. Additional knowledge that should be extracted from the given examples describes the evaluation criteria that are applied to the robot and the controller during operation. <p> A second method is to let an operator guide the robot in order to record the actions of the operator and to generate a performance unit for the particular operation from this demonstration, according to the "Robot Programming by Demonstration" paradigm <ref> [25] </ref>. Examples for elementary operations are door-passing, docking to a recharging station, and movements under control of a collision-avoidance mechanism. Employing the existing elementary operations efficiently to perform a specified task requires a certain amount of initial planning activity.

Reference-contexts: In navigation, the focus is especially on the architectural aspects of the application of Machine Learning techniques. Apart from solutions to single problems, the main achievement there is due to the integration of individual learning techniques in a real mobile robot. Compliant motion Compliant motion <ref> [33] </ref> refers to tasks in which a robot manipulates an object while being constrained by contacts with other objects or the environment in general. The motion freedom of the manipulated object is limited and contact forces are generated.

PRIAMOS is a mobile system with three degrees of freedom, i.e. motion in longitudinal and transverse direction and rotation around the center of the vehicle. This is accomplished by the use of four Mecanum wheels, each one driven separately. <p> One possibility to learn these skills is to let the robot use only information about what it can actually perceive (feedback from the environment), i.e. it will learn suitable reactions directly from interactions with the environment by adapting the reactive module in response to a reinforcement or performance signal <ref> [34, 35] </ref>. A second method is to let an operator guide the robot in order to record the actions of the operator and to generate a performance unit for the particular operation from this demonstration, according to the "Robot Programming by Demonstration" paradigm [25].

The next task is to combine the calculated basic features and to generate operational concept descriptions on the base of these features. In particular, this task aims at learning a hierarchy of features which can be expressed by a set of rules. <p> These descriptions are necessarily operational, since they are directly derived from the basic features which are calculated from the sensorial input. To solve this learning task, inductive learning in restricted first order logic is employed <ref> [38] </ref>. Additionally, optimal sensor parameterizations are to be learned, in order to obtain information of maximum quality. This aspect becomes especially important if a visual sensor is used. Based on a quality evaluation of acquired images, the acquisition parameters are adapted until an acceptable image quality has been obtained.

Further information concerning fine motion planning can be found in [46, 47].

Machining and Monitoring CNC machines play an important role in Flexible Manufacturing Systems: they produce the parts to be assembled. <p> Second, means are necessary to detect the beginning and the end of a phase. Both tasks can be solved by means of function approximation techniques such as neural networks or fuzzy controllers <ref> [3, 17, 19, 18, 40] </ref>. Apart from knowledge about the structure of the task, the generation of a complete elementary operation requires a description of the set of situations that are valid for the application of this particular operation.

Reference-contexts: These aspects give a strong evidence for the necessity of learning components that must be integrated parts of the system <ref> [42, 13] </ref>. Summarizing, the architecture of an autonomous mobile robot must contain performance components, such as planning modules, but it must also incorporate learning capabilities such as the incremental generation and improvement of motoric skills, or extraction of symbolic knowledge about the world from sensory data.

Reference-contexts: To build a suitable model of the machining process, it is necessary to identify a set of low-level building blocks (process steps). These blocks are commonly called machining features <ref> [43] </ref>. The machining of a specific workpiece can therefore be understood as the execution of a sequence of these blocks in proper order. The machine's behaviour is mainly determined by the NC instructions it executes.

Reference-contexts: However, the second one opens the field for prediction of deviation of quality, enhancing the commonly used methodologies. Prediction of faults can become an important issue as an effective technique aimed at operating in run time and not based on an a posteriori analysis of samples <ref> [1, 45] </ref>. To build a suitable model of the machining process, it is necessary to identify a set of low-level building blocks (process steps). These blocks are commonly called machining features [43].

LEARNING IN COMPLIANT MOTION AND MOBILITY As the work being done in B-Learn II comprises three case studies and a seven individual partners, it is not possible to give an in-depth review of every result that has been acheived in the framework of the project. <p> Employing the existing elementary operations efficiently to perform a specified task requires a certain amount of initial planning activity. First, planning takes place on the base of the geometrical model of the world <ref> [51] </ref>, taking into account constraints that are imposed on the planned path and task specification by the set of existing elementary operations. By using a library of previously performed missions and qualitatively given paths, this effort can be considerably reduced. <p> For PRIAMOS, this is accomplished by the combination of a topological map, providing an only slowly changing high-level description of the world, with continuously adapted cost functions that are associated to the individual edges and nodes of this map <ref> [51] </ref>. The second group of learning tasks aims at generating increasingly complex representations of the environment.

Reference-contexts: A second approach is to improve the design of the parts to be assembled, so that the assembly process is simplified. Although this is a good approach, it is not always possible and rarely sufficient. The third approach is to use an intelligently designed passive compliance <ref> [52] </ref>. Here, the programmed path of the end-effector is not changed by the contact forces, but it is modified by the deflections of a flexible structure between the manipulated object and the end-effector: the compliance.
