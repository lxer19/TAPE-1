Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress." ABSTRACT We present, QoSMIC, a multicast protocol for the Internet that supports QoS-sensitive routing, and minimizes the importance of a priori configuration decisions (such as core selection). The protocol is resource-efficient, robust, flexible, and scalable. In addition, our protocol is provably loop-free. Our protocol starts with a resources-saving tree (Shared Tree) and individual receivers switch to a QoS-competitive tree (Source-Based Tree) when necessary. In both trees, the new destination is able to choose the most promising among several paths. An innovation is that we use dynamic routing information without relying on a link state exchange protocol to provide it. Our protocol limits the effect of pre-configuration decisions drastically, by separating the management from the data transfer functions; administrative routers are not necessarily part of the tree. This separation increases the robustness, and flexibility of the protocol. Furthermore, QoSMIC is able to adapt dynamically to the conditions of the network. The QoSMIC protocol introduces several new ideas that make it more flexible than other protocols proposed to date. In fact, many of the other protocols, (such as YAM, PIM-SM, BGMP, CBT) can be seen as special cases of QoSMIC. The goal of this document is to present the motivation behind, and the design of QoSMIC, and to provide both analytical and experimental results to support our claims.

In our work, we suggest the use of dynamic metrics, (e.g. available bandwidth, current delay), because these provide paths that can meet QoS requirements at a given moment. Furthermore, routing with dynamic metrics can respond pro-actively to link congestion. <p> The assumption of rooted trees simplifies routing, but introduces the core selection [20] and address partitioning [12] problems, which can affect the protocol performance significantly.

Reference-contexts: Naturally, for A = 1, we have an undirected graph. For each figure, we supply the values of these two previous parameters. For our network, we use the map of the major routers of the MBone in May 1994 produced by Casner <ref> [5] </ref>. This graph is appropriate for our experiments, since it represents an actual instance of the inter-domain multicast network. We eliminate routers with only one incident edge, since such routers do not affect routing.

We use the term Destination to refer to the designated router that has a group-member in its LAN. The designated router is connected with other routers forming domains, which is the second or intra-domain level.

Reference-contexts: Traditional Internet routing protocols do not consider Quality of Service (QoS) metrics. For the support of multicast connections, a multicast backbone (MBone) was introduced as a virtual network "on top" of the Internet <ref> [9] </ref> in 1992. The MBone is expected to be phased out, as the routers in the Internet become multicast capable. In the rest of this document, we use the term router to imply a "multicast capable Internet router", unless otherwise stated.

Reference-contexts: However, the straightforward approach of exchanging dynamic link-state metrics to compute QoS based routes does not scale to large networks.

In our protocol, we compare paths in terms of their ability to support an application at a specific QoS level. Quality of Service (QoS) denotes the user-perceived quality. Recently, Zappala et al. <ref> [25] </ref> used the term Quality of Route (QoR) to refer to multiple static parameters of the route (e.g. link capacity, delay, or reliability), and this was adopted in the YAM protocol [3] 2 . <p> Routing in YAM relies mainly on this neighborhood search, but this procedure can increase the control overhead significantly. A suggested method to address this problem requires a sense of source/root domain, which is not applicable in Shared Trees unless we assume an address partitioning mechanism. Zappala et al. <ref> [25] </ref> suggested a multicast protocol that provides alternate routes to avoid a bottleneck link. This protocol does not seem applicable in the case where QoS suffers from several mildly-congested links. Finally, both protocols use only static routing information, which can lead to poor QoS performance 3 .

Reference-contexts: Current routing protocols already have the ability to carry multiple static metrics. However, the advertisement messages can collect up-to-date dynamic QoS metrics along the path that they travel (e.g, by interacting with RSVP <ref> [26] </ref>, or using measurement based metrics). Thus, although the paths that the Candidates choose is restricted by the static information in the routing information base, the New router selects among these paths using dynamic routing information.
