Title: Self-reconfiguration Planning with Compressible Unit Modules  
Author: Daniela Rus Marsette Vona 
Address: Hanover, NH 03755  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Dartmouth College  
Abstract: We discuss a robotic system composed of Crystalline modules. Crystaline modules can aggregate together to form distributed robot systems. A crystalline module can move relative to the structure by expanding and contracting. This actuation mechanism permits automated shape metamorphosis. We describe the crystalline module concept and show the basic motions that enable a crystalline robot system to self-reconfigure. We present an algorithm for general self-reconfiguration and describe simulation experiments.
