Reference-contexts: This question has been addressed for the kinematics and dynamics of the robot by conventional adaptive control systems but real-time computational requirements appear to grow out of bound when the number of state variables increases <ref> [1] </ref>. Neural networks have been applied as adaptive kinematic or dynamic controllers [2], but far the most applications are presented in the field of sensor-based control, where the neural network maps the sensor information directly into the motor commands [3,4]. An important issue is the training of the system.

Reference-contexts: An important issue is the training of the system. If an off-line supervised procedure is applied, the system is not able to adapt during operation. In our application we use a training method which adjusts the neural controller on the basis of deviations from setpoints in the sensory domain <ref> [5] </ref>. In combination with a very fast method to minimise the error, a real-time adaptive system for 2D movements has been developed [6]. For control in 3 dimensions the problem arises how to obtain information about the desired setpoint of the robot.

A common approach is to use two stationary cameras viewing the target object from a different angle.
