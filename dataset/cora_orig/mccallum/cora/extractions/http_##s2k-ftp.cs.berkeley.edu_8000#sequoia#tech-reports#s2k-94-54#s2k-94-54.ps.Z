Title: Design and Development of a Network-Based Electronic Library  
Author: Ray R. Larson 
Degree: Associate Professor

Affiliation: School of Library and Information Studies University of California, Berkeley  
Abstract: Among the proposed innovations in the Clinton Administration's plans to develop a National Information Infrastructure is the creation of, and support for, digital or electronic libraries to store and provide access to the vast amounts of information expected to made available over the "information superhighway". Although the exact nature and future architecture of such libraries is still a matter for experimentation (and debate), there are several pioneering efforts underway to establish electronic libraries and to provide access to them. This paper describes one such effort underway at the University of California at Berkeley. In collaboration with four other universities we are developing interoperable electronic library servers containing the Computer Science technical reports for each participant and making them available over the internet using standard protocols.

Reference-contexts: The database was created by scanning each report using a PC and commercial OCR software, and creating a simple bibliographic record for each item. These bibliographic records use a format developed for exchange of CSTR information via email <ref> (Cohen 1992) </ref>. 3.2 The Filesystem Layer In addition to the conventional UNIX and NFS file systems supporting the magnetic disks for the electronic library, we are using the EpochServ filesystem software to support access to the optical disk jukebox.

Reference-contexts: The ranking algorithm that we are currently using is based on the staged logistic regression method described in <ref> (Cooper et al. 1992) </ref>. From the user's point of view (or the interface programmer's point of view), the retrieval method is simply invoked as a function call (kwsearch)in a query language statement.

Reference-contexts: Materials in the Electronic Library may accessed via any protocol-compatible client, and provided by any protocol-compatible server. In general, we agree with the 9 "principles" for electronic libraries discussed by Fox <ref> (Fox et al. 1993) </ref>: 1. Declarative representations of documents should be used. Although most of our collection is now in page image and Postscript form, OCRed text is available, and we are hoping to develop SGML markup version though automatic parsing of image and text.

Reference-contexts: Investigate techniques for organizing data in electronic libraries for presentation, including virtual reality browsing. Researchers in the Berkeley group have developed an indexing tool that can segment a document into its significant subtopic sections <ref> (Hearst & Plaunt 1993) </ref>. We plan to implement a new information access paradigm that uses this section information to provide enhanced information retrieval capabilities.

Reference-contexts: In addition, we have been developing some new methods for automatically categorizing or identifying the major topics of a full-length document. This work <ref> (Hearst 1994) </ref> is still preliminary, but very promising results have been achieved for a large sample of the CSTR database. We hope to integrate the work on these indexing methods with the work on sub-element access methods for the DBMS described above.

Reference-contexts: enough to permit each user to deal with the information in the forms most appropriate to his or her needs. 3 The Berkeley CSTR Library Architecture The Berkeley group views the electronic library as a modern database application, and we are building it on top of the POSTGRES next-generation DBMS <ref> (Stonebraker & Kemnitz 1991) </ref>. The development effort at Berkeley is being carried on in parallel with Sequoia 2000, a research project that is developing a very-large-scale multimedia object server, with a focus on managing scientific data on global climate change.

Reference-contexts: We have also been developing a indexing method that can "read" the text of a document and automatically georeference any elements of the text that refer to places, providing the geographic coordinates of the point or polygon for the area discussed in the text <ref> (Woodruff & Plaunt 1994) </ref>. In addition, we have been developing some new methods for automatically categorizing or identifying the major topics of a full-length document. This work (Hearst 1994) is still preliminary, but very promising results have been achieved for a large sample of the CSTR database.
