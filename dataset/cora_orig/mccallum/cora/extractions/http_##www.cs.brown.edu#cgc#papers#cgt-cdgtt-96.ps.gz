Title: Convex Drawings of Graphs in Two and Three Dimensions (Preliminary Version)  
Author: Marek Chrobak Michael T. Goodrich Roberto Tamassia 
Abstract: We provide O(n)-time algorithms for constructing the following types of drawings of n-vertex 3-connected planar graphs: * 2D convex grid drawings with (3n) fi (3n=2) area under the edge L 1 -resolution rule; * 2D strictly convex grid drawings with O(n 3 ) fi O(n 3 ) area under the edge resolution rule; * 2D strictly convex drawings with O(1) fi O(n) area under the vertex-resolution rule, and with vertex coordinates represented by O(n log n)-bit rational numbers; * 3D convex drawings with O(1) fi O(1) fi O(n) volume under the vertex-resolution rule, and with vertex coordinates represented by O(n log n)-bit rational numbers. We also show the following lower bounds: * For infinitely many n-vertex graphs G, if G has a straight-line 2D convex drawing in a w fi h grid satisfying the edge L 1 -resolution rule then w; h 5n=6 + (1) and w + h 8n=3 + (1). * For infinitely many bounded-degree triconnected planar graphs G with n vertices, any 3D convex drawing of G must have volume 2 (n) under the angular resolution rule.

Reference-contexts: Kant [34, 33] presents a linear time algorithm for constructing 2D convex drawings with integer coordinates and (2n 4) fi (n 2) area. Chrobak and Kant [6] and, independently, Schnyder and Trotter [45] reduce the grid size to (n 2) fi (n 2). Lin and Skiena [35] (see also <ref> [1] </ref>) show that strictly convex drawings may require area (n 3 ), since a strictly convex drawing of an n-vertex cycle requires such area. <p> Our algorithm differs from theirs significantly in Step 1, however. Note that, under any of our resolution rules, if G has area A, then we can draw P to have volume A (by scaling the range of z-values to the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>). <p> In addition, by well-known properties of rational-arithmetic linear system solving, we can guarantee that the number of bits needed to represent any y-coordinate, as a rational number, is O (n log n). If we scale the y-coordinates to lie in the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, then the drawing will still be a convex equilibrium stress embedding, but will have area O (n) under the vertex-resolution rule.

Eades and Gar-van <ref> [20] </ref> show how to construct 3D convex drawings by combining the above transformation with the 2D-drawing method of Tutte [50, 51]. They also show that their drawings have exponential volume in the worst case. <p> Unfortunately, for our purposes, this approach does not in general produce nice drawings, for Eades and Gar-van <ref> [20] </ref> show that such drawings can require exponential area under the vertex-resolution rule. Thus, if we are to achieve polynomial area using this approach, we must use a more "adaptive" approach. <p> Construct an embedding of G with a convex equilibrium stress w. 2. Find a w-consistent mapping F to define a 3-dimensional convex polyhedron P that has G as its 1-skeleton. This template forms a very high-level description of our approach, as well as that of Eades and Garvan <ref> [20] </ref>. Our algorithm differs from theirs significantly in Step 1, however. Note that, under any of our resolution rules, if G has area A, then we can draw P to have volume A (by scaling the range of z-values to the interval [0; 1]). <p> The running time needed to achieve this is O (P (n)), where P (n) is the time needed to solve an n fi n linear system defined by planar constraints. Note that this area bound contrasts sharply with the exponential lower bound of Eades and Gar-van <ref> [20] </ref> for the area of Tutte drawings under the vertex-resolution rule.

The main difficulty in extending their proof to convex drawings in R 3 is that the third dimension allows a tremendous amount of extra drawing freedom. <p> By the lower bound of Garg and Tamassia <ref> [24] </ref>, this would establish an exponential lower bound on the area of this projection, hence the volume of this drawing would also be at least exponential. We define G n algorithmically. <p> This would then allow us to complete the proof by placing the graph, H k , used in the 2-dimensional lower bound of Garg and Tamassia <ref> [24] </ref>, in the interior of t . Let us therefore augment Q with additional triangular faces in a fashion that will allow us to argue that there must be at least one triangular face with three shallow edges. <p> then, our construction of G n starts with P 17 , adds v fl to be adjacent to each vertex of P 17 , augments each triangle incident to v fl to become the subgraph S t , and then adds the lower-bound graph H k of Garg and Tamassia <ref> [24] </ref> in the interior of each triangle in a S t to complete the proof.

Reference-contexts: Maxwell [40] (see also [10, 12, 52]) describes a mapping that transforms a 2D convex drawings with a certain "equilibrium property" into a 3D convex drawing. Further results on this transformation are given by Hopcroft and Kahn <ref> [31] </ref>. Eades and Gar-van [20] show how to construct 3D convex drawings by combining the above transformation with the 2D-drawing method of Tutte [50, 51]. They also show that their drawings have exponential volume in the worst case. <p> Thus, if we are to achieve polynomial area using this approach, we must use a more "adaptive" approach. As a step in this direction we note the following useful result of Hopcroft and Kahn: Lemma 3.2 <ref> [31] </ref>: Let G be an embedded planar graph with triangular external face, and let w be an internally-convex stress at internal equilibrium for G. Then there is an external extension w 0 of w that is convex and at equilibrium for G. <p> In this subsection we review the explicit formulation of Hopcroft and Kahn <ref> [31] </ref> for this mapping. Let G be a convex embedding of a 3-connected planar graph and let G have a convex equilibrium stress w. With each face r in G associate a linear function f r (x; y) = a r x + b r y + c r . <p> Given such F , define a convex polyhedron by associating the plane z = 1 with the external face and the plane defined by f r with each internal face r in G. Hopcroft and Kahn <ref> [31] </ref> show the following: Theorem 3.3 [31]: If w is a convex equilibrium stress for a convex embedding G, then the polyhedron defined by a w-consistent mapping is strictly convex. Thus, we have a template for producing 3-dimensional strictly-convex drawings of 3-connected planar graphs: 1. <p> Given such F , define a convex polyhedron by associating the plane z = 1 with the external face and the plane defined by f r with each internal face r in G.

The set U (w) changes during the execution of the algorithm. The general idea is that, unlike the previous approaches <ref> [14, 15, 8, 44] </ref>, at the time when a new vertex is installed we shift all covered vertices to the right, ensuring that the are far from nonincident edges. We give the details for ConvexDraw in the full version, proving the following theorem.

Unfortunately, when translated into algorithms the proofs to these classic theorems produce drawings with poor resolution characteristics. <p> The well-known Steinitz's theorem says that a graph admits a 3D convex drawing if and only if it is planar and triconnected <ref> [47] </ref> (see also Grunbaum [26]), properties that can be verified in linear time (see, e.g., [29, 30]). Interestingly, it is a easy exercise to derive from the published proofs of Steinitz's theorem a cubic-time method for constructing 3D convex drawings in the real-RAM model [41].

If there exists an internally-convex stress function at internal equilibrium for G, then the embedding of G is convex. Tutte shows how to use this theorem to draw G.

In this subsection we review the explicit formulation of Hopcroft and Kahn [31] for this mapping. Let G be a convex embedding of a 3-connected planar graph and let G have a convex equilibrium stress w.
