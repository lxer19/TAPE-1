Reference-contexts: Here, we describe a driver capable of significant reduction of this dissipation, for given values of voltage swing, load capacitance, and switching frequency, without performance loss. We accomplish this by stepwise charging <ref> [1] </ref>, an inductor-free form of adiabatic charging [2,3,4]. 2 Stepwise charging of voltage supplies with uniformly distributed voltages. To charge the load, each supply is switched in briey in ascending order, until the load has reached the corresponding voltage. <p> The circuit shown in Figure 1 (b) will behave identically. No additional circuitry is needed to maintain the desired voltages on the tank capacitors; the circuit is self-stabilizing <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 Design of a driver using stepwise charging Equation (2) indicates that dissipation decreases monotonically with increasing . cannot, however, usefully be made very large, because all the switches need to be operated, which itself causes dissipation.
