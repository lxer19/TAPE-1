Abstract: We are focusing on the problem of familiarization where a physician or other healthcare professional is presented with the medical record for a new patient. How can the physician get a feeling for the overall medical condition of this patient? How can a physician locate the information relevant to the patient's current problem? More generally, how can a physician become familiar enough with the case and cross the threshold of uncertainty in order to feel comfortable making a decision regarding the patient? To assist with the task of familiarization, we are developing precis-based navigation tools, where a precis is a concise summary of information and metainformation from an individual document in the medical record. Precis are introduced for each document in a new layer of technology, superimposed over the various sources of medical records such as various EMRs and paper-based systems. Using the precis, a clinician or other user may search and sort through a complex document collection to find the information relevant to the problem at hand. In this paper we outline our user model, describe the features and functions of the precis technology at its present stage of development, and discuss the technical research questions that arise in this work.

Reference-contexts: Tang, et al. have shown that even when needed information is physically present in the medical record, it very often cannot be located by the clinician because of poor organization of the paper documents. <ref> [1] </ref> The advent of the EMR offers the promise of improving on some of these problems, as many users of such systems will attest. However, many other problems with medical record complexity and fragmentation are not solved by use of the EMR, and new ones may be created.

Reference-contexts: Clinicians will often jot down brief notes, sorting, selecting, and recombining items of information, and subsequently organize them into a high-level summary, such as a dictated consultation note. This process of organizing the facts into higher-order structures is consistent with our understanding of expert reasoning <ref> [2] </ref> and analogous to the information funnel described by Blois [3].

Reference-contexts: This process of organizing the facts into higher-order structures is consistent with our understanding of expert reasoning [2] and analogous to the information funnel described by Blois <ref> [3] </ref>. In doing this the clinical problem solver must negotiate the tension between being comprehensive versus being efficient, becoming sufficiently familiar with the case to decide on a course of action, but not devoting more resources to the task than is absolutely necessary.

Reference-contexts: We see the issue of how to create precis as an important but orthogonal one to the question of whether precis-based navigation is useful, particularly for the problem of familiarization. A companion project <ref> [6] </ref> is considering techniques for classification of medical documents that could be used to associate information categories with precis. When will precis be created? This issue is also somewhat separate from the question of whether precis-based navigation is useful.

Reference-contexts: We believe that it is hardly ever the case that all relevant medical information will reside in a single system. A superimposed, precis-based layer presents a simple, uniform summary over a diverse set of medical record sources. Work in progress is addressing the development of superimposed information <ref> [7] </ref>. This paper reports on initial results from a collaborative research project involving both clinicians involved in assessing the information needs of clinicians [8] as well as computer science professionals focusing on the information models and technology for superimposed information.

Reference-contexts: The overall challenge for this work is to investigate the utility of familiarization technology to support healthcare professionals. One important function of the precis is to enable clinicians to chunk information contained in the medical record. Chunking refers to higher-order cognitive structures, such as diagnosis scripts <ref> [9] </ref> which enable experts to manipulate complex information more efficiently. By using precis, or bundles of precis, clinicians can achieve similar efficiency in a manner analogous to human cognition.
