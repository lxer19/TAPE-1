Title: An Experimental Investigation of Issues in End-to-End QoS

Abstract: Meaningful Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for `delay sensitive' networked applications must be end-to-end. This paper presents an experimental study of applications using computer workstation end-points. For the application experiments, the variables under study were the degree of multiprocessing, the transport protocol used (UDP or TCP), the process structure used by the application, and the effectiveness of priorities for achieving "real-time" behavior. The experiments were performed on the IBM RISC System/6000 workstation running AIX 3.2.5. While worst-case network delays can dominate any factors at work in the end-points, our experiments show that in the common case of a lightly loaded LAN, operating system effects are of greater magnitude than any jitter introduced by the network. Operating system issues are thus shown to be as challenging as network influences for end-to-end QoS provision. For our experimental variables, we found that: (1) priorities are of limited usefulness, (2) application process structure strongly affects jitter introduced by the scheduler, (3) the transport protocols produce different delay and jitter tradeoffs, and (4) the degree of multiprocessing has a large effect both on delay and jitter. The experimental results suggest that improved real-time support in workstation operating systems is essential for end-to-end QoS provision. Further, it is clear that this support requires careful coordination among the application, network and operating system.

Reference-contexts: Control of this scheduling is crucial to providing QoS in an end-to-end fashion. It appears that some features of "real-time" operating systems must be available to applications <ref> [1] </ref>. These features must be coordinated with network QoS provision to meet application requirements. With this "need for coordination" as a hypothesis, we undertook an experimental study of the factors affecting delay-sensitive applications.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction An increasingly important form of networked information is "delay sensitive" multimedia traffic. Traffic is carried among end-points using delay-bounded communication protocols. These protocols represent the application's interface to the network. Such protocols and protocol architectures are hence of considerable interest in the computer networking community [4], <ref> [3] </ref>, [8], and early results indicate that delay bounds can be achieved with some penalty in performance. The focus of this paper is the other element in end-to-end design [24], the behavior of the end-points [25].

Reference-contexts: The linkage between the real-time OS and real-time networking areas has been tenuous at best, and there are even fewer ties which bind real-time applications, networks, and OS. It is becoming evident that this linkage is necessary. For example, in <ref> [6] </ref>, priority-based "real-time" support in SVR4 UNIX is shown to be insufficient for good performance with local video applications.

Reference-contexts: These demands are complex due to compression and coding schemes such as MPEG, which reduce the average bandwidth required while greatly increasing the peak/average bandwidth ratio <ref> [7] </ref>. The software infrastructure supporting the application, such as the operating system and its scheduler, must periodically schedule the application when data arrives or is to be sent. Control of this scheduling is crucial to providing QoS in an end-to-end fashion.

Reference-contexts: First, we should ensure that real-time capabilities are available in workstation operating systems. Second, we should work on models of interaction between the end-points and the network fabrics which are actually deployed. Modern ATM network switches, e.g., the Bellcore experimental prototype Sunshine switch <ref> [21] </ref>, will be equipped microcontrollers on each switch port. This suggests that more sophisticated notions of network QoS provision and QoS negotiation will be possible. Third, we should continue to test our understanding of issues through experiments with applications.
