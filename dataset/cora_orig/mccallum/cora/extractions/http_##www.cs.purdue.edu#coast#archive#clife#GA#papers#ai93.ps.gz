Abstract: This paper is related to Holland's result on implicit parallelism. Roughly speaking, Holland showed a lower bound of the order of n 3 to the number of schemata usefully processed by the genetic algorithm in a population of n = c 1 2 l binary strings, with c 1 a small integer. We analyze the case of population of n = 2 bl binary strings where b is a positive parameter (Holland's result is related to the case b=1). In the main result, for all b&gt;0 we state a lower bound on the expected number of processed schemata; moreover, we prove that this bound is tight up to a constant for all b1 and, in this case, we strengthen in probability the previous result. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * This paper has appeared in Artificial Intelligence (61) 2, 307314. + Universit Statale di Milano, Dip. di Scenze dell'Informazione, via Comelico 39, 20135 Milano, Italy. # International Computer Science Institute, Berkeley, CA 94704, and Progetto di Intelligenza Artificiale e Robotica, Dip. di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci, 32, 20133

Reference-contexts: A well known result is Holland's estimate of an n c 1 l lower bound on the number of effective schemata processed <ref> [1] </ref>, where n is the number of structures processed and c 1 is a small integer. This result is usually interpreted to say that, despite the processing of only n structures, the GA processes at least n 3 schemata.
