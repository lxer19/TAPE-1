Title: On Fuzzy Implication Relations

Abstract: For the last decade, fuzzy controllers have been applied with great success to a variety of domains. Nevertheless the underlying theoretical framework still remains unsatisfactory. One of the key questions still open is concerned with approximate reasoning. How should we determine the effect of applying the fuzzy rule [IF x is ~ A THEN y is ~ B] to ~ A 0 with ~ A 0 , ~ A, and ~ B being fuzzy sets? The idea is to use sup-min composition ~ A 0 ffi ~ R [ ~ A! ~ B] to get the conclusion ~ B 0 . But which fuzzy relation or which class of fuzzy relations represents the semantics of the given rule [ ~ A ! ~ B] best? We claim that the derivation of a proper implication relation has to consider two different aspects at the same time: it should fulfill our intuitive expectation and obey certain mathematical laws as well. From a fuzzy rule based system we expect a both intuitively plausible and mathematically sound behaviour. Therefore neither a solely intuitive nor a solely mathematical motivated implication relation solves our problem. In this paper we will present a derivation sufficiently dealing with both aspects and resulting in a special class of fuzzy implication relations.

Reference-contexts: There are a lot of suggestions on the choice of ~ R, see [Le90] and <ref> [Bo92] </ref>, for example. Different suggestions for ~ R may be classified by a handful of intuitive criteria to support the decision 1 process for a given application. Interesting results may be found in [FMT80], [Le90], [MZ82], or [VS92], e.g. <p> the six conditions derived from equation (25) for all ff 2 [0; 1], and therefore there is no implication relation ~ R meeting our intuitive understanding in the crisp case for all ff-cuts involved. 2 In this section w.l.o.g. we omit index i. 9 The so called G odel-relation (e.g. <ref> [Bo92] </ref>) R G (x; y) := 1 if A (x) B (y) B (y) otherwise. comes very close to the desired behaviour by obeying (26) - (30) and violating only (31). 6 Conclusion In this paper we have shown that there is just one distinct class of binary implication relations meeting
