Reference-contexts: Hence it makes sense to look for monotone simulations of f k;N before looking for more general simulations of AC (0) functions. Our results show that small monotone perceptrons computing these functions cannot exist. It is necessary to address a result due to Allender <ref> [1] </ref>, which issues a warning as to the significance of results about monotone threshold circuits. Essentially due to the fact that Toda's theorem [12] relativizes, Yao's result (Theorem 5 above) does not carry over to the non-monotone case, at least not via exponential lower bounds.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently perceptrons (see definition below) have received some renewed attention because of their relevance to some important issues in structural complexity theory. In <ref> [6] </ref> it was shown that perceptrons cannot compute parity unless they are of exponential size 1 . This has the consequence that (9A)(P 6 PP PH A ). <p> Further related results and extensions have been obtained by Beigel, Reingold and Spielman [4], Aspnes, Beigel, Furst and Rudich [2], and Tarui [11]. An interesting open question left by the work of <ref> [6] </ref> is whether there is an oracle separating the hierarchy PP PH . More precisely, is there an oracle A such that the following is true: (8d)(PP p;A d+1 6 d ). <p> We refer to these subcircuits as the AND/OR subcircuits. A perceptron is monotone if its threshold gate is monotone and its AND/OR subcircuits contain no negations. 1 In <ref> [6] </ref> perceptrons were referred to as PP PH -circuits.

Reference-contexts: We suspect that certain AC (0) boolean functions of depth d + 1 cannot be computed by even exponentially large perceptrons of depth d. In fact this problem can be reduced to a problem about circuits of a specific depth via the H-astad switching lemma <ref> [7] </ref>. If we could show the result for d = 3, it then follows for all d &gt; 3 by applying that lemma. Lacking the techniques to prove this in full generality, we concentrate here on monotone perceptrons. <p> To repeat our main motivation more precisely, if Theorem 7 could be shown to hold in the non-monotone case, i.e., if AC (0) (0) 3 , then an application of the H-astad switching lemma <ref> [7] </ref> would establish a separation of the hierarchy PP PH relative to some oracle. Depth 4 versus depth 3 is critical, since it would be the base case in such a proof.

Reference-contexts: therefore d TAC (0) (0) In this paper we sharpen Theorem 5 and Corollary 6 for k = 3, that is, we show Theorem 7 d AC (0) (0) 3 and therefore d TAC (0) (0) While this paper was being written, a stronger result due to H-astad and Goldmann <ref> [8] </ref> appeared, which states that for all k, d AC (0) (0) k . The results reported here were obtained independently and differ in some important technical details. A discussion of H-astad and Goldmann's results and their relationship with this paper is given at the end of this section. <p> Beigel [5] sharpened this result for perceptrons with small weights. We now describe our results in more detail and clarify the relationship between this paper and the one of H-astad and Goldmann <ref> [8] </ref>. H-astad and Goldmann prove that for all k, d AC (0) (0) They also adopt similar techniques to Yao's, using a more detailed version of his inductive argument. Their theorem clearly implies the main Theorem 7 as stated above.

Reference-contexts: Lacking the techniques to prove this in full generality, we concentrate here on monotone perceptrons. Our main result is that certain monotone depth 4 AC (0) functions cannot be computed by exponentially large depth 3 monotone perceptrons. This result represents a refinement of a result due to Yao <ref> [13] </ref> (whose techniques are also adopted). However to explain the relationship with Yao's work and to describe our results more precisely, we must introduce the basic concepts and notation. <p> Notation 3 Let A and B be classes of circuits. If there is a function computable by circuits in class A which requires circuits in class B of exponential size, we write A 6 exp B.

Many of these are from Yao <ref> [13] </ref>, sometimes in a slightly different form. Let f k;N (x 1 ; x 2 ; :::; x N k ) denote the canonical AC (0) k -function. <p> Definition 8 For any function h : f0; 1g N ! f0; 1g, a pair of sets (p; q) is called a separator if p is a subset of h 1 (1) and q is a subset of h 1 (0). We use the same separators as in <ref> [13] </ref>. (p k;N ; q k;N ) denotes the separator for f k;N .
