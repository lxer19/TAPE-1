Abstract: Sequoia 2000 Technical Report 91/6 Computer Science Division Dept. of Electrical Engin. and Computer Science University of California, Berkeley Berkeley, CA 94720 Joseph Pasquale, George C. Polyzos Abstract The goals of the Sequoia 2000 Network are to provide high throughput for the massive observation input data and image output data characterizing Global Change applications, as well as real-time services for animations and collaboration tools such as video conferencing. The first phase of the network will be based on a T3 (45 Mb/s) backbone and FDDI for local distribution. The research issues we are focusing on include protocols that provide deterministic and statistical performance guarantees and take advantage of hierarchical coding of information, and the design of I/O system software that integrates process and device communication software with network pro tocol software.

Reference-contexts: The protocols to be executed on the host workstations, the gateways, and the switches (or the switch controllers) will have to include provisions for real-time channel establishment/disestablishment <ref> [Ferr90a] </ref> [Ferr91], so that guarantees about the network's performance (throughput, delay, and delay jitter) can be offered to the users who need them [Ferr90b]. A related issue is the specification of the quality of network service needed by the user. <p> We have developed two heuristics, for both source-based routing and distributed implementations, that provide near optimal configurations for typical communication networks. We have also started investigating the conversion of our real-time communication scheme <ref> [Ferr90a] </ref> to one based on the simplex multi-cast (instead of unicast) real-time channel as the fundamental abstraction to be implemented by the service. <p> A network layer protocol (RTIP) and some ideas that address this problem of providing end-to-end performance guarantees have been described in [Lowe91] following the methodology for real-time virtual circuit establishment provided in <ref> [Ferr90a] </ref>. An important feature of RTIP is that it is an extension of IP (the Internet network layer protocol), and interoperates with it. We are in the process of implementing RTIP and plan to experimentally evaluate its performance.

Reference-contexts: The protocols to be executed on the host workstations, the gateways, and the switches (or the switch controllers) will have to include provisions for real-time channel establishment/disestablishment [Ferr90a] [Ferr91], so that guarantees about the network's performance (throughput, delay, and delay jitter) can be offered to the users who need them <ref> [Ferr90b] </ref>. A related issue is the specification of the quality of network service needed by the user. Such a specification must be powerful enough to describe the required guarantees, and yet must be realizable by mechanisms that already exist, or that can be built into the networks of interest.

Reference-contexts: The protocols to be executed on the host workstations, the gateways, and the switches (or the switch controllers) will have to include provisions for real-time channel establishment/disestablishment [Ferr90a] <ref> [Ferr91] </ref>, so that guarantees about the network's performance (throughput, delay, and delay jitter) can be offered to the users who need them [Ferr90b]. A related issue is the specification of the quality of network service needed by the user. <p> The Sequoia Network should cooperate with the local operating systems in the offering of a synchronization service. We are studying the possibility and convenience of basing such a service on our distributed scheme for delay jitter control, which operates at the network layer <ref> [Ferr91] </ref>. We also plan to investigate alternative approaches to providing the required network performance based on more subtle forms of resource reservations (e.g., by introducing traffic priorities in conjunction with input rate enforcement mechanisms such as the "leaky bucket").

Reference-contexts: Displayed at 20 frames per second, a 1-minute animation generates 1.2 GB (and a rate of 160 Mb/s). For a concrete example consider the Analysis of High-Resolution Visible Data for Photosynthetically Available Radiation (PAR). PAR can be obtained by a method originally developed by Gautier <ref> [Gaut80] </ref>. This application uses various resolutions of geostationary and AVHRR data, up to half hour and 1 km.

Reference-contexts: This is particularly relevant when one is fast-forwarding through a sequence of images; supporting full resolution might not be possible, and users might be willing to accept a lower-resolution picture in return for faster movement. One approach to this problem is hierarchical coding <ref> [Karl89] </ref>, whereby a unit of information such as an image is decomposed into a set of ordered sub-images. A selected subset of these may be re-composed to obtain various levels of resolution of the original image.

Reference-contexts: Finally, in order to support the group communication required by multi-person collaboration tools such as video conferencing and shared windows, we are investigating multicast routing algorithms which seek to minimize cost (e.g., link bandwidth use), while simultaneously bounding delay between each source and its destinations <ref> [Komp92] </ref>. This is possible by delivering data using a tree out of the source and avoiding data duplication as much as possible. Finding the minimum cost tree is an intractable problem (known as the Steiner tree problem).

Reference-contexts: A network which provides high throughput and real-time response is needed. Global Change researchers are already planning to exploit modes of distributed computation, and have identified the need for high-speed networking. For example, Mechoso et al. <ref> [Mech91] </ref> consider the distribution of a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model across high-speed networks. The basic idea is to use machines with the most suitable architecture for each component of the distributed computation.

Reference-contexts: A T3 network which provides most of the T3 potential bandwidth (45 Mb/s) would allow delivery of the same file in under 3 minutes. However, Sequoia will also provide an environment for distributed computing. For instance, computational processes could be placed near the BIGFOOT database <ref> [Ston92] </ref>, which would store the observational data, as well as the output data. Scientists would interact remotely with BIGFOOT using their workstations, which they would use for visualization of output.

Reference-contexts: An important feature of RTIP is that it is an extension of IP (the Internet network layer protocol), and interoperates with it. We are in the process of implementing RTIP and plan to experimentally evaluate its performance. We are also implementing prototype versions of two real-time transport protocols, RMTP <ref> [Verm91] </ref> and CMTP [Wolf91], which allow applications to specify quality of service parameters. While RMTP is message-oriented, and offers a traditional send/receive interface to its clients, CMTP is oriented towards continuous-media applications, and allows senders to continue "producing" information that is continuously "consumed" by the corresponding receivers.
