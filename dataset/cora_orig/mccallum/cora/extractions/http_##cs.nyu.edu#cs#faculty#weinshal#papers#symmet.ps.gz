Title: Using Bilateral Symmetry To Improve 3D Reconstruction From Image Sequences

Abstract: In previous applications, bilateral symmetry of objects was used either as a descriptive feature in domains such as recognition and grasping, or as a way to reduce the complexity of structure from motion. In this paper we demonstrate how bilateral symmetry can be used to improve the accuracy in 3D reconstruction. The symmetry property is used to "symmetrize" data before and after reconstruction. We first show how to compute the closest symmetric 2D and 3D configurations given noisy data. This gives us a symmetrization procedure, which we apply to images before reconstruction, and which we apply to the 3D configuration after reconstruction. We demonstrate a significant improvement obtained with real images. We demonstrate the relative merits of symmetrization before and after reconstruction using simulated and real data.

Reference-contexts: Find the optimal rotation and translation which minimizes the sum of squared distances between the original points and the reflected corresponding points (Fig. 1c). This is a well known problem of pose estimation. To find the solution we use the method of Arun et. al. <ref> [1] </ref>, which requires no more than the evaluation of SVD. 4. Rotate the reflected points f ~ P i g n1 i=0 by the optimal rotation. 5. Average each original point P i with its reflected matched point ~ P j , obtaining the point ^ P i (Fig. 1d). <p> Two randomly chosen 3D mirror-symmetric connected configuration of 10 points are shown in Figure 5a. Points were selected randomly in the Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 67 (1):48-57, July, 1997 9 box <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 3 . Eight noisy 2D projections were created for each of the 3D configurations. Perspective projection was used with a focal length of 5. <p> In order to obtain some statistical appraisal of the improvement obtained by correcting for symmetry, we applied the simulation many times while varying the simulation parameters. Points were, again, selected randomly in the box <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 3 . The number of points was varied between 8 and 24, the number of views was varied between 8 and 24, and the noise level was taken as = 0:001; 0:005; 0:01; 0:05 and 0:1. Every combination of parameters was simulated 300 times.

Reference-contexts: We are given several noisy 2D projections of such an object, where the projection is approximately weak perspective (scaled orthographic). As a working example, we combine the invariant reconstruction algorithm described in <ref> [16] </ref> with a symmetrization method, to improve the input and output data in the structure reconstruction from several views. Exploiting the fact that the 3D structure to be reconstructed is mirror-symmetric, we incorporate a symmetrization procedure into the reconstruction scheme as a separate module, independent of the reconstruction method used. <p> As a working example, we demonstrate and compare the algorithms using the invariant reconstruction method described in <ref> [16] </ref> and reviewed in Appendix B. The reconstruction was performed on both simulated and real data. The reconstruction obtained from the three procedures was compared with the original mirror-symmetric 3D configuration. <p> B Review of the invariant reconstruction algorithm This linear method was described in <ref> [16] </ref>.
