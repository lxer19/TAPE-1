Title: MIXED FINITE ELEMENT METHODS FOR MODELING FLOW AND TRANSPORT IN POROUS MEDIA  
Author: MARY F. WHEELER AND IVAN YOTOV 
Abstract: Mixed finite element methods applied to modeling flow and transport in porous media are discussed for both single and multiphase problems. An expanded mixed finite element method is introduced to treat general geometry problems and full tensor permeability and/or dispersion. Extensions to discontinuous coefficients, multiblock domains, and non-matching grids or faults are also discussed. Convergence results for some of these procedures are presented. 1. Introduction. In this paper, we present a brief summary of results on applying mixed finite element methods for modeling flow and transport in porous media,

Theorem 2.1. <p> Thus the vector unknowns can be eliminated resulting in a sparse positive definite system for the pressures. Moreover, superconvergence for both pressure and velocity is obtained at certain discrete points. These results have been generalized in <ref> [1] </ref> to logically rectangular and triangular grids. Special choice of M simplifies the interactions of the vector basis functions in (2.11) and (2.12). <p> Therefore the vector unknowns can be eliminated, leading to cell-centered finite differences for the pressure with 9 point stencil in two dimensions and 19 point stencil in three dimensions.

It has been implemented in the Rice Unstructured Flow code [37], which can handle coupled unstructured and logically rectangular grids. A locally mass conservative characteristics-mixed method has been developed by Arbogast and Wheeler [3] for solving advection-dominated transport problems. <p> In those cases, multiblock structure has to be used, with different mappings for the different blocks. Therefore the global map is piecewise smooth and could be non-differentiable across the interfaces (see Figure 1). Computational results in <ref> [2, 1] </ref> indicate loss of convergence along interfaces of map or coefficient discontinuities. Note that the transformed computational tensor is K = JDF 1 K (DF 1 ) T ; so a nonsmooth mapping leads to a discontinuous coefficient on the reference domain.

Reference-contexts: Further analysis and implementation of these algorithms can be found in [25, 33, 34, 46, 15, 26]. We wish to note however that mixed finite element methods with special numerical quadrature have been employed in petroleum reservoir engineering for more than forty years <ref> [43, 8] </ref>. This relationship between cell-centered finite differences and mixed finite element methods was first observed and analyzed by Rus-sell and Wheeler in [45]. Superconvergence results were later obtained by Weiser and Wheeler [48]. Other convergence and superconvergence results for the mixed methods can be found in [41, 30, 32]. <p> In this section we consider mixed finite element discretizations for the coupled nonlinear system of mul-tiphase flow equations. We consider an immiscible two-phase flow model. Extensions to three or more phases are straightforward. The governing equations for fluid motion through porous medium are mass conservation of phases <ref> [8, 15] </ref> @(s i i ) + r ( i u i ) = q i ; (x; t) 2 fi (0; T ); (3.1) where i = w (wetting), n (non-wetting) denotes the phase, s i is the phase saturation, i is the phase density, is the porosity, q i <p> Remark 3.4. The cell-centered finite difference scheme described above has been commonly used by the environmental and petroleum engineers <ref> [43, 8] </ref>. It conserves the mass of all phases locally. The mixed finite element formulation provides more robustness for handling irregular geometries and general boundary conditions, and is useful in the convergence analysis. Remark 3.5. The use of quadrature rule requires evaluation of i (s h ) on the edges.

The relative permeabilities k i (s i ) vanish at s i = 0, i = w; n (see <ref> [9] </ref>), making the equations (3.1) degenerate .

Reference-contexts: The method has been implemented in a single phase flow 3-D simulator ParFlow1 developed by the Subsurface Modeling Group at Rice University [22]. The code runs on massively parallel distributed memory computers. A substructuring domain decomposition algorithm by Glowinski and Wheeler <ref> [36, 24] </ref> is used in the solver. Balancing preconditioner developed by Cowsar, Mandel, and Wheeler allows for ill-conditioned problems with several orders of magnitude variation in the permeability to be handled very efficiently. <p> The stencil is slightly modified only near the interfaces where Lagrange multipliers are added. Therefore the computational cost for the enhanced method is compatible with the one for the expanded method. Moreover, the Glowinski-Wheeler domain decomposition algorithm <ref> [36, 24] </ref> can be used to solve the linear system. There, 8 MARY F. WHEELER AND IVAN YOTOV Fig. 2. <p> We close the section with a remark that all of the above schemes can be implemented very efficiently, using the domain decomposition techniques proposed by Glowinski and Wheeler <ref> [36, 24] </ref> with balancing preconditioning [21], or the parallel multigrid algorithm developed by Cowsar, Weiser, and Wheeler [23]. These methods require only subdomain linear solves, where the grids are regular and structured, with possible slight modification of the computational stencil near the interfaces.
