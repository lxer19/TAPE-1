Abstract: Hop-by-hop inter-domain routing protocols, such as BGP and IDRP, use independent route selection to realize domains' local policies. A domain chooses its routes based on path attributes present in a route. It is widely believed that these inter-domain routing protocols always converge. We show that there exist domain policies that cause BGP/ IDRP to exhibit persistent oscillations. In these oscillations, each domain repeatedly chooses a sequence of routes to a destination. Complex oscillation patterns can occur even in very simple topologies. We analyze the conditions for persistent route oscillations in a simple class of inter-domain topologies and policies. Using this analysis, we evaluate ways to prevent or avoid persistent oscillations in general topologies. We conclude that if a hop-by-hop inter-domain routing protocol allows unconstrained route selection at a domain, the protocol may be susceptible to route oscillations. Constraining route selection to a provably safe procedure (such as shortest path) can reduce the number of realizable policies. Alternatively, a routing policy registry can help detect unsafe policies.

Reference-contexts: The first approach analyzes domain policies a priori to detect the likelihood of route oscillations; one or more domain policies can then be modified to avoid oscillations. A routing policy registry (such as the Internet Routing Registry <ref> [3, 1] </ref>) is useful for this.

Reference-contexts: The first approach analyzes domain policies a priori to detect the likelihood of route oscillations; one or more domain policies can then be modified to avoid oscillations. A routing policy registry (such as the Internet Routing Registry <ref> [3, 1] </ref>) is useful for this. The second approach introduces additional protocol mechanisms that detect the existence of an oscillation, and modify one or more domains' policies to suppress the oscillation. <p> Next-hop based preference functions have a possible stable assignment in D. In the next section, we show how next-hop based policies may be relatively safely realized when used in conjunction with other mechanisms. Existing Internet provider policies are largely next-hop based <ref> [3] </ref>. However, for next-hop based preference functions to cause oscillations, there must exist a cycle of domains in which every D i prefers D i1 over their fall-back route. <p> One mechanism for making policies available is a route registry. Such a route registry currently exists in the Internet for inter-provider route coordination <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. This seems to be a reasonable approach for safely realizing richer policies through hop-by-hop inter-domain routing in the Internet. 5.2 Detecting and Suppressing Oscillations Global analysis detects the likelihood of oscillations a priori.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, this traffic feedback causes route oscillations in IGRP. The original ARPANET link state based SPF algorithms [18, 15] used delay as a metric. Route oscillations were observed on the ARPANET when portions of the network were heavily congested. These route oscillations are also due to similar traffic feedback <ref> [4] </ref>. Several solutions to delay based oscillations have been proposed. These solutions use approaches such as constraining route selection [15], co-ordination [30], and explicit routing [5]. Path vector protocols were developed [26, 27] to suppress counting-to-infinity problems that occur in distance vector algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Using this representation, we derive necessary and 1 Even though BGP and IDRP are path-vector protocols, the routing behavior described in this paper is not caused by the loop suppression mechanism they use.

We know from [28, 16] that a distance vector hop-by-hop algorithm augmented with a loop suppression mechanism always converges, i.e., never oscillates. This algorithm is similar to a PAIRS algorithm constrained to only select shortest PATH routes <ref> [26, 7] </ref>. 4.2 Next-hop D 2 in Figure 1 advertises r 1 and r 2 to D 0 . By looking at the entire PATH of those routes, D 0 only selects r 2 and not r 1 .

Reference-contexts: it forwards that packet towards D 2 , and D 2 could switch to state 3 before forwarding the packet back to D 0 . (5) Independent of the initial r-states of the domains, PAIRS always exhibits persistent oscillations in this topology. (6) The original hop-by-hop distance vector algorithms of <ref> [26, 28, 16] </ref> are provably loop-free; local policies that are configured at each domain introduces the oscillations. 4 There exist preference functions that cause PAIRS to behave differently for different initial r-states.

However, domains can independently choose their preference functions. It is widely believed that this distributed route computation converges, regardless of the preference functions at participating domains <ref> [22] </ref>. In this paper, we demonstrate the contrary.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, a domain can maintain a time-decayed count of the route advertisements seen from each neighbor domain. If this instability count exceeds an empirically derived threshold, the domain may assume the likelihood of an oscillation. This scheme is currently deployed in the Internet <ref> [29] </ref> to suppress route advertisements caused by frequent topology changes. The above detection schemes can generate false positives. In either scheme, the domain that maintains the history may not contribute to the oscillation, but may be sympathetically oscillating with some other domain that does. <p> Instability counts cannot distinguish between oscillations and route advertisements caused by frequent topology changes. Therefore, it is desirable to apply our general rule to modify policies only temporarily. Instability based suppression <ref> [29] </ref> modifies policies temporarily. The original policies are restored after the instability count decays below another empirically derived threshold.
