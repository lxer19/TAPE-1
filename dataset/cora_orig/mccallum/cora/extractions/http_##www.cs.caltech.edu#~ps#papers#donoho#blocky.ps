Abstract: We describe bases of smooth wavelets where the coefficients are obtained by integration against (finite combinations of) boxcar kernels rather than against traditional smooth wavelets. Bases of this type were first developed in work of Tchamitchian and of Cohen, Daubechies, and Feauveau. Our approach emphasizes the idea of average-interpolation - synthesizing a smooth function on the line having prescribed boxcar averages and the link between average-interpolation and Dubuc-Deslauriers interpolation. We also emphasize characterizations of smooth functions via their coefficients. We describe boundary-corrected expansions for the interval, which have a simple and revealing form. We use these results to re-interpret the empirical wavelet transform - i.e. finite, discrete wavelet transforms of data arising from boxcar integrators (e.g. CCD devices). j;k (t)f (t)dt with j;k very special L 2 (IR) functions given by dyadic scaling and integer translation of a mother wavelet [43,12]. When the wavelet is smooth and has several vanishing moments, the wavelet coefficients (ff j;k ) can decay rapidly with increasing resolution j, a property which is useful for data compression purposes [2,20]. One can envision situations where technology offers unique opportunities to efficiently calculate integrals with boxcar functions j;k = 2 j=2 1 [k=2 j ;(k+1)=2 j ] ; it is interesting to consider wavelet-like transforms with coefficient functionals derived from those integrals. For a two-dimensional example, consider this caricature of CCD imaging: a "digital retina" is formed from a square array of square cells, each of which contains a miniature device integrating the flux of light falling inside the cell. The cells are connected to a pyramid of circuitry x1. Introduction

Reference-contexts: To be more precise we recall the pyramid filtering algorithm for obtaining theoretical wavelet coefficients of functions in L 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, as described in Cohen, Daubechies, Jawerth, and Vial [10], hereafter [CDJV]. <p> This hybrid transform has properties paralleling traditional theoretical wavelet transforms.

(HT3) The first n coefficients ~ [n] = sult from pre-conditioned pyramid filtering U j 1 ;j 0 ffiP <p> The constants of equivalence do not depend on n = 2 j 1 , but may depend on j 0 and on the wavelet being used. (HT5) The coefficients ~ (n) measure smoothness. Each Besov space B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref> with (1=p 1) &lt; &lt; min ( R; D) and 0 &lt; p; q 1 is characterized by the coefficients in the sense that k ~ (n) k b p;q k ( ~ fi j 0 ;k ) k k ` p + ( jj 0 X j ~ff <p> in the sense that k ~ (n) k b p;q k ( ~ fi j 0 ;k ) k k ` p + ( jj 0 X j ~ff j;k j p ) 1=p ) q ) 1=q ; (1:1) is an equivalent norm to the norm of B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; here s + 1=2 1=p, with constants of equivalency that do not depend on n, but which may depend on p; q, j 0 and the wavelet filters.

Each Triebel-Lizorkin space F p;q [0; 1] with (1= min (1; p; q) 1) &lt; &lt; min ( R; D), 1 &lt; p; q &lt; 1, is characterized by the coefficients, in the sense that, with j;k again the normalized boxcar, k ~ (n) k f p;q k ( ~ fi j 0 ;k ) k <p> 1, is characterized by the coefficients, in the sense that, with j;k again the normalized boxcar, k ~ (n) k f p;q k ( ~ fi j 0 ;k ) k k ` p + k ( jj 0 k is an equivalent norm to the norm of F p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. 6 David L. Donoho So the empirical wavelet coefficients, which derive solely from finite filtering calculations of boxcar integrals, are actually the first n theoretical coefficients for a nicely behaved transform of integrable functions. <p> B/W transforms on the interval We now develop boxcar/wavelet transforms for L 1 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. These are based on adapting the inhomogeneous B/W transforms for L 1 (IR) to "life on the interval". We will often write K j as shorthand for f0 k &lt; 2 j g. Theorem 4.1. Let D be an even integer. <p> Theorem 4.1. Let D be an even integer. Let j 0 be a non-negative integer satisfying 2 j 0 &gt; 2D + 2 (non-interacting boundaries). Then there exists a collection of functions ' [ ] [ ] j;k such that every f 2 L 1 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> has a repre sentation f ~ k=0 [ ] X 2 j 1 X ff j;k j;k ; with L 1 convergence of partial sums j j 1 as j 1 ! 1. <p> In this volume, see the articles of Daubechies [13] and Andersson, Hall, Jawerth, and Peters <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> ; : : : ; (ff j;k ) k2K j ; : : :): The norm kk f p;q [0;1] = k (fi j 0 ;k ) k2K j 0 k ` p + k ( jj 0 k2K j gives an equivalent norm for the Triebel spaces F p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, where p; q 2 (1; 1) and 1= min (1; p; q) 1 &lt; &lt; min (R; D). <p> Also kk b p;q [0;1] k (fi j 0 ;k ) k2K j 0 k ` p + ( jj 0 X jff j;k j p ) 1=p ) q ) 1=q ; (4:2) where s = + 1=2 1=p, gives an equivalent norm for the Besov spaces B p;q <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, where 1=p 1 &lt; &lt; min (R; D), p; q 2 (0; 1].

Spaces V j [0; 1] Suppose we are given averages (fi j;k = 2 j=2 a j;k : 0 k &lt; 2 j ) for boxes I j;k = [k=2 j ; (k + 1)=2 j ] in the unit interval [0; 1], and that 2 j &gt; 2D + 2 ("noninteracting boundaries"). <p> Spaces V j <ref> [0; 1] </ref> Suppose we are given averages (fi j;k = 2 j=2 a j;k : 0 k &lt; 2 j ) for boxes I j;k = [k=2 j ; (k + 1)=2 j ] in the unit interval [0; 1], and that 2 j &gt; 2D + 2 ("noninteracting boundaries").

A key property is D V j [0; 1]: Indeed, if is a polynomial of degree D, then # j = . <p> Hence the extrapolated averages satisfy ~ fi j;k = 2 j=2 Ave j;k , k 2 ZZ, and so the reproducing formula for the transform on IR, (3.4), gives = 2 j=2 k=1 which exhibits as an element of V j <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The composition of operations f ! (fi j;k ) K j ! ( ~ fi j;k ) k ! ~ f defines a projection P [0;1] [0;1] j f. <p> However, the approximations are quantitatively somewhat worse at the endpoints than in the middle of the interval. We now seek a representation of the finite-dimensional space V j <ref> [0; 1] </ref> involving finite sums. Each extrapolated coefficient ~ fi j;k with k &lt; 0 is a linear functional of the extrapolating polynomial, and hence of the left-end samples (fi j;k : 0 k D). <p> We therefore have, by rearranging the sum (4.3), Lemma 4.4.

Daubechies wavelets Let N denote the Daubechies [11] wavelet of compact support deriving from a filter with 2N nonzero coefficients. Recently, Lemarie [39], Shensa <ref> [47] </ref>, and Beylkin and Saito [4] have observed that with D = 2 (N 1), F D+1 is the autocorrelation function of the Daubechies wavelet N ; see also Daubechies [12, page 210].

Reference-contexts: Credit where credit is due Decompositions in which the analysis wavelets are finite linear combinations of boxcars and the synthesis wavelets are smoother than boxcars were developed by Tchamitchian <ref> [48] </ref> and by Cohen, Daubechies, and Feauveau [9, Section 6]. They fall under the general topic of "biorthogonal wavelet bases", as a very special case. The decompositions we discuss coincide numerically with Boxcar/Wavelet Decompositions 3 a family of bases biorthogonal to the Haar system introduced in [48,9]. <p> For j &lt; j 0 , we note that j;k = P j 0 j;k so h j;k ; fl 3.2.2. A special case of spline systems The specific system we are discussing here has arisen already, in special cases, in the articles of Tchamitchian <ref> [48] </ref> and in Cohen, Daubechies, and Feauveau [9], hereafter [CDF]. [CDF] obtains wavelets 1; ~ N ' and 1; ~ N from two-scale symbols 1; ~ N m 0 by a route involving manipulation of trigonometric polynomials. <p> Such systems are called vaguelettes in the book of Yves Meyer, and this family of ideas has been canonized in the "Lemme des Vaguelettes", (Meyer [44, pp. 270].

Extension of such ideas to L p and Sobolev boundedness of transforms have also been made (e.g. Meyer [43]). The ideas of Cohen, Daubechies, and Feauveau [9] are, roughly speaking, in the vaguelettes tradition, with a transposition of regularity concepts from Holder regularity to L 2 -Sobolev regularity.
