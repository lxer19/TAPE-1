Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this note we give an upper bound on the size of any finite subgroup of GL (n; Z). The example of signed permutation matrices shows that such subgroups can have size at least (n!)2 n . In fact, W. Feit has recently announced <ref> [3] </ref> that by using some unpublished results of B.

Reference-contexts: To simplify statements let F S (n) denote the size of the largest finite subgroup of GL (n; Z). Elementary divisibility conditions yield a naive upper bound of F S (n) &lt; (2n)! [7]. Friedland <ref> [4] </ref> gives a more precise estimate involving the Jordan number, denoted j (n). The Jordan number is defined as the maximal index of a normal abelian subgroup of any finite subgroup &lt; GL (n; R). The existence of such a bound is a well-known result of Jordan. Friedland shows ([4], Corollary <p> Unfortunately this assertion is still unproved. Its proof would give a bound of F S (n) of the now known asymptotic order. We refer the reader to Friedland's interesting paper <ref> [4] </ref> for a more thorough discussion of these and related issues. We proceed from a different point of view, instead deriving an asymptotic estimate for F S (n) from a well-known divisibility criteria for orders of finite subgroups of GL (n; Z). We use only elementary number-theoretic arguments. Remark.
