Abstract: Many distributed multimedia applications have the ability to adapt to fluctuations in the network conditions. By adjusting temporal and spatial quality to available bandwidth, or manipulating the playout time of continuous media in response to variations in delay, multimedia flows can keep an acceptable QoS level at the end systems. In this study, we present a new scheme for adapting the transmission rate of multimedia applications to the congestion level of the network. The scheme called the direct adjustment algorithm (DAA), is based on the TCP congestion control mechanisms and relies on the end-to-end Real Time transport Protocol (RTP) for feedback information. Our investigations of the DAA scheme suggest the efficiency of the scheme in utilizing network resources and decreasing loss ratios. Also, the scheme is shown to be fair towards competing TCP traffic. However, with no support from the network, long distance connections receive less than their fair share.

Reference-contexts: It is obvious that the direct adjustment algorithm is unfair towards the long distance connection. 19 This is due to a problem already noticed in TCP [12, 29] and early ABR proposals <ref> [1] </ref>, namely the beat-down problem. The beat-down problem arises as a result of the increase in the loss probability with each additional traversed link, see also [28]. Hence, the long distance sender receives control messages with higher loss values than the loss values reported to the local senders.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A large part of the multimedia applications used currently in the Internet, such as VIC [21], VAT [19], NEVOT <ref> [2] </ref> and NEVIT [30] are based on the UDP and RTP [24] transport protocols. However, both UDP and RTP offer no quality of service control mechanisms and can therefore not guarantee any level of QoS.

Reference-contexts: This would get costly if one has to pay for the reserved but unused resources. Many distributed multimedia applications exhibit flexibility to fluctuations in the network conditions <ref> [6] </ref>. By adjusting the media quality to available bandwidth or manipulating the playout time of continuous media in response to variations in delay, multimedia flows can keep an acceptable QoS level at the end systems without necessarily requiring any additional capabilities in the network.

Reference-contexts: These oscillations result in part from the additive increase/multiplicative decrease approach and in part from the partial incorrectness of the TCP model. Additive increase/multiplicative decrease schemes are inherently oscillatory. That is, such systems do not converge to an equilibrium but oscillate around the optimal state <ref> [7] </ref>. Also, the TCP-model we are using for determining the maximum allowed transmission rate does not consider the bandwidth available on the network or the number of connections sharing a link.

Reference-contexts: With such schemes the user can send its best effort traffic without regard to the network congestion state. This approach is based on using per-flow scheduling mechanisms, that isolate the different flows <ref> [8] </ref> and would thereby prevent flows using a disproportionate bandwidth share from congesting the link. However, considering that a router needs to simultaneously support thousands of connections, such an approach would add considerable complexity to the routers.

Reference-contexts: Interval fi B RTCP RTCP Packet size (1) with the minimum interval set to 5 seconds and B RTCP as the bandwidth dedicated for RTCP and is set to 5% of the bandwidth used by the session. Detailed analysis of this issue can be found in <ref> [11] </ref>. Up to the scaling threshold the number of RTCP packets received by the session members does not stay constant and actually increases linearly with the addition of each new member. Note that the equation presented here is only an approximation. <p> This value was used in [5] and various simulations and measurements done in <ref> [11] </ref> suggested its suitability as well. * Using L smooth i and (RTT i ) the sender calculates R TCP i for receiver i as in Eqn. 2. * For the case of (L smooth i 16%) the sender sets its transmission rate to (min [R TCP-min ; R Add ]) <p> So, with the higher loss ratio the sources will tend to decrease their sending rates more often and thereby introduce the here observed unfairness.

Reference-contexts: The additive increase factor was set to 50 kb and the multiplicative decrease factor to 0.875. Those values were suggested in [5] to be most appropriate based on measurements. The router is a random 6 early drop (RED) gateway as was proposed by Floyd and Jacobson <ref> [13] </ref>. A RED gateway detects incipient congestion by computing the average queue size. When the average queue size exceeds a preset minimum threshold the router drops each incoming packet with some probability. Exceeding a second maximum threshold leads to dropping all arriving packets. <p> All connections deploy the direct adjustment algorithm and are persistent sources. That is, they always have data to send with the maximum allowed rate. They all have the same round trip times and are similar in their requirements and characteristics. The router is a RED router <ref> [13] </ref> just as in Sec. 5 with a buffer of 200 kbytes. In all of our simulations, we set the packet size to 1 kbyte which is a typical video packet size. Tab. 1 depicts the average utilization results achieved for different round trip times and different link bandwidths.

Reference-contexts: DAA is based on a combination of two approaches described in the literature, namely: additive increase/multiplicative decrease schemes proposed in [3, 5] and an enhancement of the TCP-throughput model described in <ref> [14] </ref>. While having applications adapt to network conditions has already been studied in other proposals [3, 5], little has been said about the fairness of this approach, its scalability and usability in heterogeneous environments. <p> This approach not only keeps the average queue length low but ensures fairness and avoids synchronization effects. In all of our simulations presented in this paper the minimum drop threshold of the router was set to 0.5 and the maximum one to 0.95 based on results achieved in <ref> [14] </ref>. As Fig. 3 shows, the adaptive connections share the available bandwidth among themselves, leaving less than 5% for the TCP connection. This, however, was to be anticipated. <p> However, considering that a router needs to simultaneously support thousands of connections, such an approach would add considerable complexity to the routers. Another approach described in <ref> [14] </ref> is for the routers to deploy mechanisms to identify connections using disproportionate bandwidth shares and restrict these connections. One method for identifying connections using higher bandwidth shares than they should is to use the TCP bandwidth usage model. <p> This model determines the maximum bandwidth share (R TCP ) a TCP connection having the same steady-state loss ratio, maximum packet size and minimum round trip time of the connection would be using. The relationship between throughput and loss was calculated in <ref> [14, 23] </ref> to be: R TCP = RTT fi Loss (2) with MTU as the maximum packet length and RTT as the round trip time of the connection. To derive Eqn. 2 consider a TCP connections with round trip time RTT. <p> A TCP conformant adaptation scheme would thereby use this model for regulating the transmission rate. While this model is rather simple, it is only partially correct. It does not consider timeout cases or delayed acknowledgments. Also, simulations run in <ref> [14] </ref> show that it applies only up to a loss ratio of 16%. Finally, note that this model is based on a single TCP connection with a steady-loss ratio.

Reference-contexts: In such a heterogeneous environment the conflicting bandwidth requirements cannot be satisfied with one transmission rate. Therefore, the rate is usually adapted to the worst receiver requirements, thereby reducing the perceived QoS at all receiving sites. To avoid these problems, various proposals have been made for hierarchical data distribution <ref> [15, 22] </ref>. Those proposals are based on partitioning a data stream into a base layer, comprising the information needed to achieve the lowest quality representation and a number of enhancement layers. The different layers are then sent to different multicast sessions.

Reference-contexts: As the different layers might use different paths and hence have different round trip times, the receivers need to resynchronize the arriving data. Additionally, data partitioning might lead to a drift problem caused by motion compensated coding if only the lower bit rate layer is received <ref> [16] </ref>. Another approach for layered transmission is to simply transmit the same data stream encoded with different quality levels on different multicast sessions [20]. As the streams contain all the necessary information for decompression, the receivers need only to join one multicast session.

Reference-contexts: However, while in the ABR case the network determines the appropriate rate the senders should use, in our case the senders determine the sending rate using the control messages sent by the receivers. One of the main evaluation criteria of the various proposed ABR schemes <ref> [17, 26] </ref> is their fairness towards connections with the same parameters and requirements but with different round trip times and paths. As a fairness criterion we used the max-min fairness definition as it was described in the ATM Forum traffic management specification 4.0 [25].

Reference-contexts: Up to our knowledge, no solution has been proposed for solving this problem in TCP until now. In the case of ABR, several solutions requiring the network switches to calculate the fair share and sending this value to the sources were introduced <ref> [18] </ref>. (a) Bandwidth distribution (b) Loss A solution that would ensure fairness for both TCP connections as well as adaptive sources would be to choose an approach similar to that used in ABR.

Note that RTP is not a transport protocol in the 4 common sense.

Reference-contexts: However, such an approach requires the exchange of state information between the source end system and the network as it is the case for the available bit rate service of ATM <ref> [25] </ref> or between the sender and the receivers as its is the case for TCP [31] and the scheme described here. <p> As a fairness criterion we used the max-min fairness definition as it was described in the ATM Forum traffic management specification 4.0 <ref> [25] </ref>. With this definition, a connection's bandwidth request is either satisfied or set to the smallest fair share calculated at all traversed links. <p> Work done on other adaptation schemes such as [5] show the same unfair behavior noticed in this work [11]. A possible solution might be to introduce a service class for adaptive applications similar to the ABR service of ATM <ref> [25] </ref>. That is, let the network nodes determine the exact fair bandwidth share a connection should use to avoid congestion and notify the sender of this fair share. A main drawback of the scheme is its oscillatory behavior.

Reference-contexts: Various adaptation algorithms proposed in the literature <ref> [3, 5, 27] </ref> were shown to be efficient in terms of the first two goals of low losses and high utilization but neglected the fairness issue. <p> As an example for this behavior, we tested the approach described in [5]. This scheme has great resemblance to the schemes described in <ref> [3, 27, 10] </ref> and is based on the same additive increase/multiplicative decrease approach. With this approach the sender reduces its transmission rate by a multiplicative decrease factor after receiving feedback from the receiver indicating losses above a certain threshold called the upper loss threshold.

Reference-contexts: The beat-down problem arises as a result of the increase in the loss probability with each additional traversed link, see also <ref> [28] </ref>. Hence, the long distance sender receives control messages with higher loss values than the loss values reported to the local senders. In addition to the higher loss ratio of the transient connection it also has a higher round trip time.

Reference-contexts: It is obvious that the direct adjustment algorithm is unfair towards the long distance connection. 19 This is due to a problem already noticed in TCP <ref> [12, 29] </ref> and early ABR proposals [1], namely the beat-down problem. The beat-down problem arises as a result of the increase in the loss probability with each additional traversed link, see also [28].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A large part of the multimedia applications used currently in the Internet, such as VIC [21], VAT [19], NEVOT [2] and NEVIT <ref> [30] </ref> are based on the UDP and RTP [24] transport protocols. However, both UDP and RTP offer no quality of service control mechanisms and can therefore not guarantee any level of QoS. <p> We are currently working on enhancing the scheme with methods to dynamically discover the appropriate values. Better tuned additive increase factors might also lead to a more stable bandwidth distribution. Finally, we are currently working on implementing the direct adjustment scheme in the NEVIT <ref> [30] </ref> video tool and will soon be running different tests to verify the behavior we noticed through the simulations. 12 Acknowledgments The RTP/RTCP simulation models were mainly implemented by Timur Friedman and improved by Frank Emanuel.

Reference-contexts: However, such an approach requires the exchange of state information between the source end system and the network as it is the case for the available bit rate service of ATM [25] or between the sender and the receivers as its is the case for TCP <ref> [31] </ref> and the scheme described here. As these state information have to traverse at least a part of the network, the source will not be able to change its sending rate immediately after a change in the congestion state of the network. <p> With each loss notification, TCP reduces its transmission window by half. Older TCP versions, e.g., Tahoe-TCP reduce it even down to one packet <ref> [31] </ref>. So, while the adaptive source keeps on sending with the high transmission rate until an RTCP packet with loss indication arrives, the TCP source reduces 7 scheme its transmission window and thereby its rate.

Reference-contexts: Ergonomic studies and the experience gained from the Internet demonstrates that people can use audio and video data as long as the information content is above a minimum level <ref> [32] </ref>. This level depends on media content and the task in hand. For instance, a foreign language is more difficult to understand than a native language when audio quality is reduced.

Reference-contexts: That is, all RTCP messages were correctly delivered to all receivers. The link rate was set to 1 Mb/s, the propagation delay to 10 msec and the packet size to 1 kbytes. As background traffic we used an active-idle source as was described in <ref> [33] </ref>, see Fig. 8. The number of packets generated during an active state is geometrically distributed with mean N p . The pause between two packets during the active state is drawn from a negative exponential distribution with mean T off . <p> The pause between two packets during the active state is drawn from a negative exponential distribution with mean T off . The idle states can have any general distribution with mean T idle . Based on the traffic characteristics described in <ref> [33] </ref>, we used an active-idle source with N p set to 50, T off set to 2 msec and T idle set to 5 seconds. Fig. 10 shows the transmission bandwidth of the adaptive sender when multicasting data to a varying number of members. <p> With the max-min allocation, the connection from source 0 to destination 0 should then be getting 1.5 Mb/s. 18 In Fig. 12, we use a generic fairness topology as was proposed in <ref> [33] </ref> to investigate the fairness of the algorithm when handling with connections that have the same requirements and parameters but differ in their round trip times and traversed paths. All the links have a link rate of 1 Mb/s and are 1000 km long.
