Title: WebCiao: A Website Visualization and Tracking System  
Author: Yih-Farn Chen Eleftherios Koutsofios 
Address: 600 Mountain Ave. Murray Hill, New Jersey  
Affiliation: AT&T Labs Research  
Abstract: WebCiao is a system for visualizing and tracking the structures of websites by creating, differencing, and analyzing archived website databases. The architecture of WebCiao allows users to create customized website analysis tools by combining a set of query and analysis operators on a virtual database pipeline. Each virtual database sent on the pipe can be converted to directed graphs, database views, or HTML reports. Within a graph view, operators can be fired from any graph node to study a selected neighborhood. WebCiao helps creators of large websites to monitor the dynamics of structural changes closely. It also helps web surfers to quickly identify new products and services from a website. An on-line demo, Website News, based on the WebCiao technology, has helped sharpen our focus with its daily analysis of new web contents from the internet and telecommunications industries.

Related Work Recently, there have been growing interests in visualizing the complex structures of major websites -- mainly to help web users locate information faster without getting lost. Examples include WebMap <ref> [1] </ref>, which captures a user's dynamic interactions with the web pages and visualizes the navigation history, and NetCarta's Web Mapper [2], which performs a static analysis of the structure of any selected website.

Reference-contexts: A frequent visitor to a website may prefer to be notified when changes occur on that website. Most website change-tracking systems or notifiers such as Smart Bookmarks <ref> [3] </ref> or AIDE [4] focus on textual changes, while WebCiao focuses on structure changes on a website. WebGuide [5] combines AIDE and the visualization component of CIAO-html, the predecessor of WebCiao, to allow the examination of both textual and structure changes in web repositories.

Reference-contexts: WebCiao inherits our years of software reverse engineering [14] experience in querying, analyzing, and visualizing large and complex software structures. WebCiao is an instance of Ciao <ref> [6] </ref>, a multi-language graphical navigator for software and document repositories. Ciao has been instantiated for C, C++, Java, Ksh, HTML, and some other languages and business databases. The architecture style shown in Figure 1 applies to all languages.

Reference-contexts: Architecture of WebCiao HTML Information Abstractor: hia extracts web pages from a website and converts them into a CQL <ref> [7] </ref> database according to an Entity-Relationship model, which includes URL entities such as HTML and image files, relationships such as image and text hyperlinks, and their associated attributes such as URL addresses and anchor text. hia allows users to specify, with regular expressions or lists, what pages to include or exclude <p> The following examples demonstrate how WebCiao operators can be combined for different analysis and visualization tasks by using a pipeline. In a three-layer content analysis of AT&T's website (four-layer link analysis), we captured 1,019 web pages and 13,649 links, and created a 1.24 MB CQL <ref> [7] </ref> database.

Reference-contexts: However, the current framework of WebGuide does not allow global database queries and analysis operators to be performed on a set of web pages. Website News was inspired by both WebGuide and Brewster Kahle's Internet Archive <ref> [8] </ref>, which has the vision of building a complete running snapshot of the public world-wide-web so that the history of anyone's favorite sites can be preserved.

Reference-contexts: Application: Website News A demo called Website News <ref> [9] </ref> has been set up to demonstrate applications of the WebCiao difference databases. We archive the home pages of a selected set of frequently-visited websites (such as AT&T, Microsoft, Netscape, and IBM) on a daily basis.

Reference-contexts: Reports like these have allowed us to monitor the dynamics of each website closely and recursively. In response to a request from an AT&T marketing group, we have created a separate Website News demo for the telecommunications industry group <ref> [10] </ref>, which includes the websites of AT&T, MCI, Sprint, and the seven Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCS). It also demonstrates that the same set of CGI scripts we developed can be reused on a collection of websites that might be of interest to a community of users.
Reference: [11] <author> AltaVista. </author> <note> http://altavista.digital.com. </note>
Reference-contexts: However, we will withdraw the news report of any website upon the request of its creator. This is similar to the policy adopted by many free information services (such as AltaVista <ref> [11] </ref>). 5. Related Work Recently, there have been growing interests in visualizing the complex structures of major websites -- mainly to help web users locate information faster without getting lost. <p> If the complete Internet Archive becomes a reality, our vision is that one day a user can use Website News and WebCiao not only to analyze the history of any changed websites, but to construct a search engine like AltaVista <ref> [11] </ref> on WWW deltas. 6. Summary and Future Work We have found WebCiao to be quite flexible in querying and visualizing the structures of complex websites. The difference database created by WebCiao allows us to monitor the dynamics of many major websites closely and effectively.

In WebCiao, we can simply run a closure operator performing reachability analysis on the selected node followed by a selection operator based on the URL addresses, anchor text of each link, or page contents (if archived).

Reference-contexts: WebCiao is also very effective in computing metrics on website structures or their changes. For example, to compute the change rate of pages on a website (such as similar work done in <ref> [18] </ref>, which used a dynamic trace), we can simply run separate difference database queries that limit the selections to added, deleted, or changed links, and then pipe the results to a simple counting or statistics tool.
