Reference-contexts: This suggests that the links we would like to display in a threading interface, and which result in structures we would like to process as a unit, are not objectively defined "pattern-matching" <ref> (Allan, 1996) </ref> or "structural" (Blustein, 1993, Ch. 3) links.

These lines of evidence suggest text similarity could be a clue to the existence of a response relation between messages as well.

Reference-contexts: In Internet electronic mail, the use of Message-Id and In-Reply-To fields are optional and their format and nature is only loosely constrained when they are present <ref> (Crocker, 1982) </ref>. Subject lines for both Usenet messages and Internet mail are allowed to contain arbitrary text, clients are inconsistent in their use of Re: tags, and manual editing of Subject lines further confuses the issue.

Reference-contexts: We will then rely on machine learning methods to combine these multiple uncertain clues into a decision procedure. This is a widely used strategy in speech and language processing, and has been successfully applied to complex IR problems as well <ref> (Croft et al., 1994, Spertus, 1996) </ref>. A machine learning approach also allows the system to be tailored to user preferences as expressed, for instance, through their overriding of system decisions.

Reference-contexts: Time. Most replies to a message occur within a window of a few days after the message is posted. A simple statistical model, perhaps similar to those used in analyzing citation patterns <ref> (Egghe and Rao, 1992) </ref>, could be used to take this tendency into account. To use temporal information, however, anomalies introduced by unsynchronized clocks and nonstandard uses of time zones must be dealt with. Recognizing Other Message Relationships.

Reference-contexts: An automated system may be able to make use of this information as well to make this conversational structure explicit as a thread. How this might be done is discussed in the next section. 3 Cohesion and Thread Structure Halliday and Hasan <ref> (Halliday and Hasan, 1976, pp. 299-300) </ref> have stressed the role of cohesion or linking between the parts of a dialogue. Language provides a variety of mechanisms for achieving this cohesion. <p> Language provides a variety of mechanisms for achieving this cohesion. One such mechanism is lexical cohesion and in particular lexical repetition <ref> (Halliday and Hasan, 1976, Ch. 6) </ref>, that is the repeating of words in linked parts of a discourse. The phenomenon of lexical repetition suggests that the similarity of the vocabulary between two messages should be a powerful clue to whether a response relationship exists between them.

Reference-contexts: Attempts have also been made to go beyond unlabeled linking to use similarity matching in detecting discourse relations. Hearst's TextTiling algorithm, which was motivated by the observations of Halliday and Hasan and other discourse researchers, uses vector space similarity to decompose a text into topically coherent segments <ref> (Hearst, 1994) </ref>. Allan uses the graph structure of a network of raw similarity links to infer meta-links corresponding to discourse relations such as comparison and summarization (Allan, 1996). These lines of evidence suggest text similarity could be a clue to the existence of a response relation between messages as well.

Reference-contexts: However, the error rate of the above approaches is considerable. While the References field is in theory required for replies to Usenet messages <ref> (Horton and Adams, 1987) </ref>, threading is hampered by clients that delete portions of the References chain due to limitations on field length. In Internet electronic mail, the use of Message-Id and In-Reply-To fields are optional and their format and nature is only loosely constrained when they are present (Crocker, 1982).

Reference-contexts: For instance, the VM mail reader (Jones, 1991) allows grouping of messages by any of several criteria, including having the same subject line text, the same author, or the same recipient. The mail archiving program hypermail <ref> (Hughes, 1995) </ref> marks up archives of email with a variety of links, including threading information. It attempts first to find a message ID in the In-Reply-To field and match it to a known message.

Reference-contexts: As in Usenet messages, the Subject line is typically copied to the Subject field, preceded by Re:. Some mail clients provide threaded displays, though this is less common than in bulletin board systems.

Reference-contexts: For instance, a system that sorts messages into folders based on their content is unlikely to be 100% accurate. The effectiveness of content-based text categorization systems varies considerably among categories <ref> (Lewis and Gale, 1994, Wiener et al., 1995) </ref>, and accuracies over 90% are rarely reported. This means that threads with many component messages will almost always be broken up and distributed into multiple folders by such a system, making it difficult for a reader to follow the conversational structure. <p> Message Categorization. Certain types of messages such as calls for papers and job ads are unlikely to be replies to other messages and/or are unlikely to be replied to publically. Text categorization methods <ref> (Lewis and Hayes, 1994) </ref> can detect these and provide evidence against the presence of response links. Detection of Siblings.

Reference-contexts: In responses which do not directly quote the parent message, the author will often use linguistic cues to indicate the parent message, e.g. I really like the suggestion that... or Your argument is....

Reference-contexts: As with bulletin board systems, replying to an email message often inserts structural information into the reply. For Internet-based mail systems <ref> (Rose, 1993) </ref>, the reply command may copy the Message-Id field or other identifying information from the parent, into the In-Reply-To field of the child. As in Usenet messages, the Subject line is typically copied to the Subject field, preceded by Re:.

Reference-contexts: Measuring the similarity of vocabulary between texts is of course a widely used strategy for finding texts with similar topic to a query <ref> (Salton, 1989, Ch. 10) </ref>. Indeed, similarity-based methods have been used to construct hypertexts linking documents or passages of documents on the basis of topic similarity (Bernstein, 1990, Salton and Buckley, 1991, Blustein, 1993, Salton et al., 1994a, Salton et al., 1994b, Myka and Guntzer, 1995, Salton et al., 1996).

Reference-contexts: We assigned them random ranks lower than that of any retrieved message.) Target messages were ranked using the cosine similarity formula and a variant of tf fi idf weighting <ref> (Salton and Buckley, 1988, Salton et al., 1996) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Salton and Buckley 5 showed that text matching on a collection of Usenet messages which included substantial quoted material was highly effective at retrieving related messages, under a definition of relatedness that subsumed the response relationship we are interested in <ref> (Salton and Buckley, 1991) </ref>. Finally, the non-quoted content of the response can be expected, based on the coherence phenomena described earlier, to repeat words from the parent message. <p> Our results can be roughly compared with the 0.90 recall and 0.72 precision in Salton and Buckley's experiments with Usenet messages containing quoted material <ref> (Salton and Buckley, 1991) </ref>. However, Salton and Buckley were attempting to find related messages, not just parent messages, and defined all messages with the same Subject line as being related. This is a simpler task than finding the single parent of a message.
