Abstract: We report results from perceptual judgment, delayed matching to sample, and long-term memory recall experiments, which indicate that the human visual system can support metrically veridical representations of similarities among 3D objects. In all the experiments, animal-like computer-rendered stimuli formed regular planar configurations in a common 70-dimensional parameter space. These configurations were fully recovered by multidimensional scaling from proximity tables derived from the subject data. We show that such faithful representation of similarity is possible if shapes are encoded by their similarities to a number of reference (prototypical) shapes, as in the computational model that accompanies the psychophysical data.

Reference-contexts: integral stimuli (such as lightness-saturation), and 13 There are good reasons to keep the representation space low-dimensional (Edelman and Intrator, 1997), as well as evidence that it is, as a rule, indeed such (Shepard, 1980). 24 city-block used when the perceptual dimensions of the stimulus are compelling and easily sepa-rable <ref> (Attneave, 1950) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: pairs of objects, or if subjects are responding randomly, then some of the rankings would be intransitive, compromising the validity of the geometrical model of similarity space, and precluding the use of MDS, which assumes that the representation space in which the data points are to be embedded is metric <ref> (Beals et al., 1968) </ref>. We tested transitivity for triplets of object pairs. Given that the results were of the form "objects (i; j) are more/less similar to each other than objects (p; q)", it is straightforward to verify 12 transitivity for triplets of object pairs.

Reference-contexts: The computational feat of the recovery of the two relevant dimensions and of their faithful representation is much more difficult than finding the proverbial needle in a haystack. This is a manifestation of a general property of high-dimensional spaces that has been termed "the curse of dimensionality" <ref> (Bellman, 1961) </ref> (for an illustration of problems associated with finding structure in multidimensional spaces, see (Huber, 1985)). This feat was performed by the subjects' visual system; the role of MDS was merely to help visualize the relevant information present in the subjects' response patterns.

Reference-contexts: This amounts to discarding valuable information inherent in the similarity of the stimulus to other objects known to the system (Edelman, 1995c). Models designed to operate on a level of categorization less specific than that of identity, such as Recognition By Components <ref> (Biederman, 1987) </ref>, similarly discard information by ignoring "metric" details of the stimulus in favor of a "qualitative" representation; 2 a recent attempt to circumvent this problem is described in (Stankiewicz and Hummel, 1996). <p> In particular, a complete specification of the geometry of an object, whether qualitative or quantitative, clearly must be considered veridical. An example of an approach that adopts the former view is provided by the RBC model <ref> (Biederman, 1987) </ref>. In comparison, quantitatively veridical representations are called for by object recognition systems in computer vision, which typically require exact and detailed information regarding the object's geometry; a typical example is the alignment model (Huttenlocher and Ullman, 1987; Ullman, 1989).

Reference-contexts: In the preceding section, we saw that lists of distinctive features are an unlikely candidate for such an intermediate representation. We observe now that geon structural descriptions (GSD's), postulated in <ref> (Biederman and Gerhardstein, 1993) </ref>, are equally unlikely here. All our objects shared the same structural description (that is, the "anatomy" of all the animals was the same).

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that mere low stress is not a sufficient indicator of the significance of the solution, because low-stress spurious solutions are relatively frequent when the number of points is small. This problem can be remedied by using MDS in a confirmatory mode <ref> (Borg and Lingoes, 1987) </ref>; one of the possibilities in that case is to compare the MDS solution to a pattern to which the points are known to conform. <p> employed will be given in sections 3.1 and 4.1. 2.2.2 Comparison with objective similarities Following to the principle of confirmatory MDS, we quantified the similarity between the configurations derived by MDS from the subject data in each experiment, and the configurations built into the stimulus parameter space, using Procrustes analysis <ref> (Borg and Lingoes, 1987) </ref>. For each data set, we first computed the optimal Procrustes transformation (combination of scaling, rotation, reflection, and translation) between the MDS-derived and the true configurations; these are similarity transformations that do not affect the shape of the configuration. <p> Finally, we also quantified the similarity between two configurations by computing their coefficient of congruence | a correlation-like measure applied to the vectors of interpoint distances in the two configurations <ref> (Borg and Lingoes, 1987) </ref>. 5 To assess the significance of a similarity measure (Procrustes distance or coefficient of congruence) in a given experiment, we compared it to the expected mean similarity, obtained by a bootstrap procedure (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993) from repeatedly permuted data. <p> In the present study, we went on to correlate the MDS configurations with patterns of similarities built into the stimuli, which amounted to the use of MDS in confirmatory mode <ref> (Borg and Lingoes, 1987) </ref>, and allowed us to impart statistical significance to the notion of veridicality of representations employed by our subjects. 7.2 Implications for theories of recognition and categorization Our experiments were designed to assess the (hitherto unknown) degree of veridicality of internal representation of similarity among 3D objects, and <p> It is important to realize that our conclusions are based not on low stress per se, but rather on the recovery of a specific pattern built into the stimuli. This effectively allowed us to invoke MDS in a confirmatory mode <ref> (Borg and Lingoes, 1987) </ref>, and to demonstrate the statistical significance of the solution. The remarkably faithful reconstruction of the parameter-space arrangements of the stimuli from the subject data would have been unlikely if the subjects stored distinctive features or structural descriptions of the input shapes.

Reference-contexts: In this latter case, we pooled the individual data sets, by concatenating the subject matrices and using the condition=matrix option in the SAS MDS procedure; this corresponds to an individually weighted MDS analysis <ref> (Carroll and Chang, 1970) </ref>, which returns, in addition to the configuration common to all the subjects, a set of individual weights called dimension coefficients, one per axis, which represent the scaling transformations specific for each subject. Large differences in the values of the weights indicates lack of concordance among subjects.

Reference-contexts: Reviews of recognition theories (Ullman, 1989; Ullman, 1996; Edelman and Weinshall, 1996) distinguish between three different ways to compensate for the effect of varying pose: invariant features, alignment, and structural descriptions. The first of these attempts to reduce the problem of recognition to that of pattern classification <ref> (Duda and Hart, 1973) </ref>, by representing objects as vectors of features that are, ideally, invariant with respect to pose and other variables irrelevant to object identity (Mundy and Zisserman, 1992).

Reference-contexts: This amounts to discarding valuable information inherent in the similarity of the stimulus to other objects known to the system <ref> (Edelman, 1995c) </ref>. <p> A number of recent studies indicate that responses of several such object-specific modules (a "Chorus of Prototypes" <ref> (Edelman, 1995c) </ref>), each coarsely tuned to a different reference shape, may be able to support veridical representation of a range of shapes similar to the reference ones (Edelman and Duvdevani-Bar, 1997; Edelman, 1996a; Edelman, 1995b). 12 Accordingly, we chose R reference objects (e.g., for the parameter-space Star configuration, the endpoints of <p> A central feature shared by Chorus and GCM is the distinction between persistent and ephemeral representations <ref> (Edelman, 1995c) </ref>: to represent a wide variety of stimuli, it is enough to store a relatively small number of (persistent) object representations explicitly, with the rest of the stimuli being treated as ephemeral, and characterized by their shape-space proximities to the persistent objects.

Reference-contexts: Thus, like many other characteristics of visual representation and processing <ref> (Schyns, 1996) </ref>, the need for veridicality can be seen to depend on the task at hand. 7.5 Conclusions We reported a series of experiments involving animal-like shapes, in which we were able to recover the objective parameter-space configuration imposed on the stimuli from the subject data, using multidimensional scaling.

Reference-contexts: The resolution of this issue will have to await a future work. 17 A similar faithful recovery of parameter-space configurations has been recently demonstrated in the monkey, using the dmts paradigm (Sugihara et al., 1996). 28 experiments involving simple perceptual qualities such as color <ref> (Shepard, 1962b) </ref>, as well as some 2D contours (Shepard and Cermak, 1973; Cortese and Dyre, 1996), and even 3D shapes (Edelman, 1995b), our results show for the first time that such recovery is possible with complex 3D objects, arranged in a variety of shape-space configurations.

Reference-contexts: The embedding is sought subject to the requirement of minimal discrepancy (stress) between the distances in the resulting configuration and the distances specified in the data <ref> (see Shepard, 1980, for a review) </ref>. In the nonmetric version of MDS, the ranks of the distances, rather than their values, are used in the computation (Kruskal, 1964a; Shepard, 1966). <p> Two psychological space metrics were found to fit most similarity data: Euclidean used for integral stimuli (such as lightness-saturation), and 13 There are good reasons to keep the representation space low-dimensional (Edelman and Intrator, 1997), as well as evidence that it is, as a rule, indeed such <ref> (Shepard, 1980) </ref>. 24 city-block used when the perceptual dimensions of the stimulus are compelling and easily sepa-rable (Attneave, 1950).

Reference-contexts: in most theories of recognition is that of object constancy 1 As measured according to some straightforward image-based metric, such as the sum of squared differences of corresponding pixel values. 1 (Ellis et al., 1989; Jolicoeur and Humphrey, 1996), or invariance, whereas categorization necessarily addresses a complementary issue of generalization <ref> (Shepard, 1987) </ref> of response over distinct yet similar stimuli. Furthermore, because categorization experiments tend to employ stimuli that are extremely impoverished (and therefore easier to control parametrically), it is difficult to extend theories of categorization derived from these experiments to realistic three-dimensional objects. <p> This was achieved by embedding the stimuli in a common objective shape space | a metric space spanned by a few dozen parameters, jointly controlling the appearance of each stimulus object. We then investigated the patterns formed by the representations of the stimuli in the internal psychological space <ref> (Shepard, 1987) </ref> of the subjects. To recover the patterns of the relations among internal representations, we hypothesized that the subject data (similarity judgments, response times and confusion rates, depending on the experiment) collected psychophysically, are systematically related to the representation-space distances between the stimuli (cf. (Tomonaga and Matsuzawa, 1992)). <p> objects (N = 7 for the star and triangle configurations and N = 9 for the cross and square configurations), for which we measured all pairwise similarities 7 This decision was motivated by the characterization of the different dimensions of our shape space as inherently integral, rather than separable; see <ref> (Shepard, 1987) </ref> for a discussion of the issues relevant to the choice of the metrics. 8 This definition of geometrical similarity assumes that the shape space can be considered a vector space.

Reference-contexts: We note that the full power of the MDS as a tool for mapping the internal representation space of subjects can be realized only if the experimental approach constrains the interpretation of the potential outcome to a sufficient degree; cf. <ref> (Shepard and Cermak, 1973) </ref>. An application of MDS always produces a solution, which, furthermore, will have a low stress (i.e., low residual discrepancy with the data) if the number of points is small.

Reference-contexts: Models designed to operate on a level of categorization less specific than that of identity, such as Recognition By Components (Biederman, 1987), similarly discard information by ignoring "metric" details of the stimulus in favor of a "qualitative" representation; 2 a recent attempt to circumvent this problem is described in <ref> (Stankiewicz and Hummel, 1996) </ref>. Classical models of categorization developed in fields other than visual psychophysics adopt a more constructive approach to making use of similarity information.

Reference-contexts: metric is the Minkowski metric: d ij = [ P This formula reduces to the Euclidean metric for r = 2, the city-block metric for r = 1, and for 1 &lt; r &lt; 2 yields intermediate metrics, more appropriate in some experimental situations other than the two limit cases <ref> (Torgerson, 1958) </ref>. Physical distances (i.e., objectively measurable differences) between stimuli are not directly involved in the MDS model: distances are taken in the psychological space, not in a physical features space. This is not to say, however, that objectively measurable similarities are irrelevant.

Reference-contexts: The modus operandi of visual systems that adopt this approach has been termed by Roger Shepard 3 The idea of expressing similarity as degree of overlap between two regions is reminiscent of Tversky's feature model <ref> (Tversky, 1977) </ref>, and thus it is not surprising that the predictions of GRT can violate the metric axioms. 5 second-order isomorphism: ". . . the isomorphism should be sought | not in the first-order relation between (a) an individual object, and (b) its corresponding internal representation | but in the second-order <p> It should be noted that transitivity is a property of the metric space (geometrical) models of similarity, and does not necessarily hold, e.g., in the framework of Tversky's set-theoretic model <ref> (Tversky, 1977) </ref>. That model was, in fact, devised to account for the circumstances under which similarity is neither symmetric nor transitive.

Reference-contexts: When considered within this framework, the theories of recognition mentioned in the previous section emerge as rather unsuitable for supporting categorization (Edelman, 1997). A typical recognition theory, such as recognition by alignment <ref> (Ullman, 1989) </ref>, postulates something like a nearest-neighbor decision as the last step in the recognition process (following compensation for the effects of viewpoint): the identity of the stimulus is declared to be the same as that of the known object most similar to it.

Reference-contexts: Such a representation of a 3D object can be relatively easily formed, if several views of the object are available <ref> (Ullman and Basri, 1991) </ref>. This can be done, e.g., by training a radial basis function (RBF) network to interpolate a characteristic function for the object in the space of all views of all objects (Poggio and Edelman, 1990).
