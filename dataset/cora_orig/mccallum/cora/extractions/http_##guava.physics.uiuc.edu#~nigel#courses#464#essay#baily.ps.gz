Title: Heisenberg Antiferromagnet  
Author: Scott Baily 
Date: May 5, 1998  
Abstract: The Heisenberg model is described. Some of the interesting behavior of Heisenberg antiferromagnets and its behavior as a function of dimension is described. One dimensional systems have no long range order, two dimensional systems order magnetically only at zero temperature, and three dimensional systems have a non-zero critical temperature. Assembling lower dimensional pieces into ladders and multilayers is especially interesting, since the behavior of the system depends on whether it is composed of an even or an odd number of pieces. An early numerical method of solution, the high temperature expansion is also explained.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A magnetic system can be modeled as a lattice of spins which interact with the applied magnetic field, and with each other. Spins interacting with a magnetic field H have the Hamiltonian <ref> [1] </ref> Ha = g B i=1 The simplest model of a ferromagnetic system is the Ising model. In the Ising model, spins can either point parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field. <p> This spherical model is unphysical, but can be solved in one, two, or three dimensions with and applied magnetic field. In addition, critical-point exponents 2 can be found exactly in higher dimensions <ref> [1] </ref>. The quantum mechanical Heisenberg model presents a more difficult problem, but can be used to model real magnetic materials provided that the materials have well localized spins and the interactions are isotropic. EuO and EuS meet these conditions. <p> EuO and EuS meet these conditions. This model provides a good description of the antiferromagnetic material RbM nF 3 <ref> [1] </ref>. The most interesting materials that are well described by the Heisenberg model are closely related to high temperature superconductors. The cuprate insulators which can be doped to produce superconductors are excellent examples of two dimensional spin one-half antiferromagnets that can be described by the Heisenberg model. <p> In this method, the partition function is expanded as a power series Z N (T; H) = T rfe fiHa g = T r (1)f1 fitr (H) + 1 fi 2 tr (H 2 ) + : : :g <ref> [1] </ref> (5) where tr H l T r H l ; and T r (1) = (2S + 1) N (6) Using these equations, the Gibbs free energy can be calculated G (T; H) = k B T ln Z N (T; H) (7) = k B T [lnfT r (1)g

Reference-contexts: The quantum mechanical Hamiltonian for a Heisenberg antiferromagnet is Ha = J hi ji where S is a three component spin operator with 2S + 1 discrete orientations. An exact solution by Bethe in 1931 showed that there is no long range antiferromagnetic order for a one dimensional chain <ref> [2] </ref>. However, long range order is predicted for a S = 1=2 antiferromagnetic material with a square lattice. Another related model that is of interest is the spherical model.

Reference-contexts: In Luttinger liquids the spin and the charge part of the added holes are separate, and move at different velocities. Doped materials composed of an even number of coupled chains might exhibit superconductivity <ref> [3] </ref>. 2 Numerical Methods The high temperature expansion is one of the simplest numerical methods used to study the Heisenberg antiferromagnet. <p> The spin gap should be about 650 K, but fits to the low temperature susceptibility yield a spin gap of 420 K [5]. However, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance measurements indicate an activation energy of 680 K <ref> [3] </ref>. C-axis coupling between layers of ladders might be explain this difference. C-axis coupling can also account for the discovery of long range antiferromagnetic ordering below 52 K in three chain ladders of SrCu 3 O 5 .

Reference-contexts: A multilayer system can be described by the Hamiltonian: Ha = J 1 Ha plane + J 2 Ha rung ; (10) where Ha plane = n X X S ff; i S ff; j ; (11) and Ha rung = X n1 X S ff; i S ff+1; i <ref> [6] </ref> (12) Layers are indexed by alpha, and sites by the indices i, and j. For J 2 &lt;< J 1 , the model describes n weakly interacting planes. <p> The resulting series can be extrapolated to the isotropic limit, by doing a variable transformation and then using Pade approximants. These estimates predict long range antiferromagnetic order and no spin gap for all values of J 1 =J 2 <ref> [6] </ref>. Systems with an even number of layers can be investigated by means of an expansion in J 2 . For large J 2 , the system behaves as a disordered spin liquid. <p> H rung can be taken to be the Hamil-tonian with Hplane treated as a perturbation. Again, Pade approximants can be determined for the resulting series. This method results in a critical value of J 1 =J 2 which scales with the number of layers as 0:913=n 0:250=n2 <ref> [6] </ref>. Recent Monte Carlo simulations of the three dimensional spin 1/2 Heisen-berg antiferromagnet on a simple cubic lattice indicate a critical temperature T c =J = 0:946 0:001 [7]. This value agrees with analytic calculations. These results are consistent with the classical Heisenberg universality class.
