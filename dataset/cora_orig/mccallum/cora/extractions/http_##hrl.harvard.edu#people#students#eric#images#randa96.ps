Abstract: For a walking robot to negotiate rough terrain it must adjust its step length to hit suitable footholds while simultaneously regulating its forward speed. This paper develops an algorithm to achieve these aims for a planar dynamic biped in the context of smooth exchange of support. The basis of the algorithm is an asymmetric gait to adjust walking velocity combined with a set of conditions on the leg lengths which ensure smooth exchange of support for any step size. The algorithm was tested on level surfaces in simulation and on an experimental biped robot. The algorithm could track a 30% change in desired walking velocity and a 25% change in desired step length.

Reference-contexts: Animals can move over extremely rugged terrain; the ability of goats to climb steep mountain sides is legendary, and humans routinely negotiate steep stairs and ladders. This motion is not smooth, however, even on level ground, since legged locomotion in many animals optimizes energy efficiency rather than smoothness <ref> [1] </ref>. Our research is aimed at understanding how to build robots that preserve the advantages of legs and simultaneously walk smoothly. In previous work [2], we considered the fundamental problem of smooth exchange of support for a simple planar bipedal robot.

Our research is aimed at understanding how to build robots that preserve the advantages of legs and simultaneously walk smoothly. In previous work <ref> [2] </ref>, we considered the fundamental problem of smooth exchange of support for a simple planar bipedal robot. <p> Specifically, we require that the velocity of the hip remains unchanged during exchange of support v = v + ; and then determine the leg lengths and velocities necessary to satisfy this condition. We presented a complete derivation of these conditions in a previous paper <ref> [2] </ref> and only summarize the results below.

Reference-contexts: There we derived a set of conditions on leg lengths which ensure that the robot's body does not experience an instantaneous change in velocity as the robot's weight is transferred from one leg to the other. Here we consider methods to control other essential parameters of gait. Hodgins <ref> [3] </ref> noted that in order for a legged robot to negotiate rough terrain, it must select a series of suitable footholds and then choose its step length to attain those footholds. During this process the robot must also regulate its forward speed. <p> To investigate the efficacy of our new algorithm we examine its performance in simulation and on our experimental hardware. In this paper, we examine walking on only flat, level surfaces. Our algorithm, however, provides a basis for walking on more difficult terrain. Raibert, Hodgins, and their colleagues <ref> [3, 4, 5] </ref> examined the problems of foot placement and forward velocity control for their running robots. These remarkable machines can run, hop, negotiate stairsteps, and even somersault, but the objective of these machines is not smooth motion, and the running gaits they employ are not smooth.

We will use this degree of freedom to control the forward walking velocity of the biped. 4 Velocity control with asymmetry Using a technique similar to the velocity control algorithm employed by Raibert <ref> [4] </ref> with his hopping robots, we seek to control the forward velocity of our walking robot by introducing an asymmetry to the walking gait.

Reference-contexts: Pneumatic cylinders drive the extension and retraction of the lower legs. We selected pneumatic cylinders for this application because of their favorable force to weight ratio. Unfortunately, continuous control of pneumatic systems is notoriously difficult (see <ref> [9] </ref>, for example), and we found it necessary to implement a nonlinear observer-based control scheme to obtain reasonable performance under walking conditions. The hip joints are driven by conventional DC servomotors with harmonic drive gearheads.

Reference-contexts: At exchange of support the weight of the robot is transferred from one leg to the other. In this section, we examine exchange of support, discuss why it might not be smooth, and present a set of constraints which ensure smooth exchange of support. Inman et al. <ref> [10] </ref> examined bipedal walking in humans and proposed a model of bipedal walking based on the compass gait (Figure 2). In this gait the leg lengths are fixed, so the hip trajectory follows the arc of a circle as the biped pivots about the distal end of the stance leg.
