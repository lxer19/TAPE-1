Abstract: We present a novel data mining approach based on decomposition. In order to analyze a given dataset, the method decomposes it to a hierarchy of smaller and less complex datasets that can be analyzed independently. The method is experimentally evaluated on a real-world housing loans allocation dataset, showing that the decomposition can (1) discover meaningful intermediate concepts, (2) decompose a relatively complex dataset to datasets that are easy to analyze and comprehend, and (3) derive a classifier of high classification accuracy. We also show that human interaction has a positive effect on both the comprehensibility and classification accuracy.

Reference-contexts: For each internal concept in the structure, there is a decision rule that determines the aggregation of concepts. Both the structure and the rules were developed manually by experts using a multi-attribute decision making shell DEX <ref> (Bohanec & Rajkovic 1990) </ref>. For the evaluation of the decomposition method, we took applicants' data from one of the floats carried out in 1994. There were 1932 applicants in that float. Each data record contained 12 two to five-valued attributes.

Reference-contexts: The described method is implemented as a system called HINT (Hierarchy INduction Tool). The system runs on common UNIX platforms. Case study: housing loans allocation The method was experimentally evaluated on a real-world dataset taken from a management decision support system for allocating housing loans <ref> (Bohanec, Cestnik, & Rajkovic 1996) </ref>. This system was developed for the Housing Fund of the Republic of Slovenia and used since 1991 in 13 floats of loans. In each float, the basic problem is to allocate the available funds to applicants.

Reference-contexts: Given an initial dataset of some target concept, the decomposition induces a definition of the target concept in terms of a hierarchy of intermediate concepts and their definitions. The dataset decomposition method is based on function decomposition <ref> (Curtis 1962) </ref>. Let a dataset E F with attributes X = hx 1 ; : : : ; x n i and class variable y partially represent a function y = F (X). <p> It is further evident that the supervised method resulted in a classifier that was superior to that developed without user's interaction. Related work The proposed decomposition method is based on the function decomposition approach to the design of digital circuits <ref> (Curtis 1962) </ref>. The approach was recently advanced by research groups of Perkowski, Luba, and Ross (Perkowski et al. 1995; Luba 1995; Ross et al. 1994). Given a Boolean function partially specified by a truth table, their methods aim to derive switching circuits of low complexity.

European Conference on Machine Learning, </booktitle> <pages> 93-107. </pages> <publisher> Springer. </publisher>
Reference-contexts: The decomposition approach as presented in this paper is limited to consistent datasets with discrete attributes and classes. However, recently developed noise and uncertainty handling mechanisms and an approach to handle continuously-valued datasets <ref> (Demsar et al. 1997) </ref> facilitate more general data-analysis tasks that are planned for the future. Another interesting issue for further work is to extend the approach to handle non-classification datasets. Possible applications of this type include data-base restructuring and discovery of functional dependencies.

Reference-contexts: Given a Boolean function partially specified by a truth table, their methods aim to derive switching circuits of low complexity. Within machine learning, an approach that relies on a given concept structure but learns the corresponding functions from the training sets is known as structured induction <ref> (Michie 1995) </ref>. Its advantages are comprehensibility and high classification accuracy. The method presented in this paper shares the motivation with structured induction, while the core of the method is based on boolean function decomposition.

Reference-contexts: The decomposition aims at deriving the new intermediate concept variable c with the smallest set of values, i.e., finding the proper labeling of partition matrix columns using the smallest set of labels. The problem is formulated as a graph coloring problem and solved by a polynomial heuristic method <ref> (Perkowski et al. 1995) </ref>. x 2 lo lo med med hi hi lo lo lo lo med lo hi hi hi hi Table 2: Partition matrix with column labels (c) for the partition hx 1 ijhx 2 ; x 3 i and dataset from Table 1.

Reference-contexts: HINT used either the structure as developed in supervised mode, or was run in the unsupervised mode on the training sets. The classification accuracies were 97.8% and 94.7%, respectively. For comparison, we used C4.5 decision tree induction tool <ref> (Quinlan 1993) </ref> and obtained the accuracy of 88.9%. These results clearly indicate that for this dataset the decomposition outperformed C4.5. It is further evident that the supervised method resulted in a classifier that was superior to that developed without user's interaction.

Reference-contexts: The partition selection can affect both the complexity and comprehensibility of the resulting datasets. In <ref> (Zupan et al. 1997) </ref>, the authors proposed different partition selection measures of which in this paper we mention and use only the simplest one: partition matrix column multiplicity -(AjB). Thus, the decomposition favors the partitions which yield the intermediate concepts with the smallest value sets. <p> To further engage the user, we let him decide whether to decompose a dataset or leave it as it is. Because of user's involvement we refer to such a process to as supervised decomposition. Compared to unsupervised decomposition <ref> (Zupan et al. 1997) </ref>, we expect a positive effect on comprehensibility. The described method is implemented as a system called HINT (Hierarchy INduction Tool). The system runs on common UNIX platforms.
