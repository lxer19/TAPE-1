Abstract: This paper studies the complexity of the assembly partitioning problem in the plane: given a collection of non-overlapping polygons, decide if there is a proper subcollection of them that can be removed as a rigid body without colliding with or disturbing the other parts of the assembly. It is shown that assembly partitioning is NP-complete. The result extends to several interesting variants of the problem.

Reference-contexts: Thus partitioning is the key to assembly planning in this case. 1 Recent work has presented polynomial-time partitioning algorithms in special cases. Arkin, Connelly and Mitchell <ref> [1] </ref> give an algorithm to partition assemblies of polygons if the separating motions are limited to single infinite translations.

Reference-contexts: Schwartz and Sharir [10] have shown that path planning can be done in polynomial time for the case considered here. We show that PP is NP-hard by a reduction from 3-Satisfiability (3-SAT), a well known NP-complete problem <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The 10 is just a scaling factor that gives extra space for the width of the parts. It is not hard to choose the a i 's; a straightforward example is given by a i = 2 i . Using a result of Erdos <ref> [4] </ref>, it is possible to select the a i 's in such a way that maxfa 0 ; : : : ; a n g = n 2 .

Reference-contexts: Natarajan [7] showed that in its most general form, assembly planning is PSPACE-hard. In practice, however, most real assemblies can be constructed with monotone two-handed assembly plans <ref> [5] </ref>. Such plans consist of a sequence of operations, where each operation merges two rigid subassemblies to make a larger one that stays rigid for the rest of the plan.

Reference-contexts: It follows that: Theorem 1 PP is NP-complete. 3 Some variants In this section we present some variants of the partitioning problem that are also NP-complete. A detailed discussion of these variants can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. For a different proof of variant 2.3 see also [14]. 3.1 Partitioning with Translations In the construction of the previous section, the moving subassembly S rotates in the upper-left corner of the assembly before exiting. <p> Hence partitioning an assembly of polyhedra is also an NP-complete problem. 4 Concluding remarks The reader may note that the assemblies above cannot be fully disassembled. Our construction can be modified to allow complete disassembly showing that assembly sequencing in itself is NP-complete <ref> [6, 14] </ref>. Space does not allow us to present this result here. In experimental assembly sequencing, an additional constraint is often added, requiring both S and A n S to be connected. A subassembly is considered connected if the union of its parts is a connected set.

Reference-contexts: The partitioning problem arises in assembly planning, where a sequence of (possibly simultaneous) assembly motions are sought to bring separated parts into their relative goal positions in an assembly. Natarajan <ref> [7] </ref> showed that in its most general form, assembly planning is PSPACE-hard. In practice, however, most real assemblies can be constructed with monotone two-handed assembly plans [5].

Reference-contexts: We will show that PP is NP-complete. It is clearly in NP, since a nondeterministic algorithm can guess S and then invoke a path planner to find the path of S out of the assembly. Schwartz and Sharir <ref> [10] </ref> have shown that path planning can be done in polynomial time for the case considered here. We show that PP is NP-hard by a reduction from 3-Satisfiability (3-SAT), a well known NP-complete problem [2].
