Abstract: This paper describes a media-independent knowledge representation scheme, or content language, for describing the content of communicative goals and actions. The language is used within an intelligent system for automatically generating integrated text and information graphics presentations about complex, quantitative information. The language is designed to satisfy four requirements: to represent information about complex quantitative relations and aggregates; compositionality; to represent certain pragmatic distinctions needed for satisfying communicative goals; and to be usable as input by the media-specific generators in our system.

Reference-contexts: words, the content language describes that which is to be asserted, recommended, believed, etc., rather than the types of communicative acts to be performed or propositional attitudes which the acts are intended to achieve. 2 Our focus is on information graphics, e.g., charts, ta by a general-purpose sentence generator (SURGE) <ref> (Elhadad and Robin, 1996) </ref>. The graphics generator transforms parts of the plan to a sequence of tasks which the user of a graphic must be enabled to perform in order to satisfy the presentation goals.

Reference-contexts: Again, although this work is at a more abstract level than pictorial instructions, its main representational concern (representing content about spatial concepts and relations) is very different from ours. The multimedia system whose focus is closest to ours is PostGraphe <ref> (Fasciano and Lapalme, 1996) </ref>, a system that generates multimedia statistical reports consisting of graphics and text. In PostGraphe a presentation is designed to satisfy a set of writer's intentions.

Reference-contexts: The COMET (Feiner and McKeown, 1991) and WIP <ref> (Wahlster et al., 1993) </ref> systems generate instructions for operating physical devices. Both systems must represent content about complex sequences of actions the user can perform on the physical device and their effects on the objects involved (distinguishing between what effects can or cannot be perceived visually and under what conditions).
