Abstract: Unrestricted control polyhedra facilitate modeling free-form surfaces of arbitrary topology and local patch-layout by allowing n-sided, possibly non-planar facets and m-valent vertices. By cutting off edges and corners, the smoothing of an unrestricted control polyhedron can be reduced to the smoothing of a planar-cut polyhedron. A planar-cut polyhedron is a generalization of the well-known tensor-product control structure. The routine Pcp2Nurb in turn translates planar-cut polyhedra to a collection of four-sided linearly-trimmed bicubic B-splines and untrimmed biquadratic B-splines. The routine can thus serve as central building block for overcoming topological constraints in the mathematical modeling of smooth surfaces that are stored, transmitted and rendered using only the standard representation in industry. Specifically, on input of a nine-point subnet of a planar-cut polyhedron, the routine outputs a trimmed bicubic NURBS patch. If the subnet does not have geometrically redundant edges, this patch joins smoothly with patches from adjacent subnets as a four-sided piece of a regular C 1 surface. The patch integrates smoothly with untrimmed biquadratic tensor-product surfaces derived from subnets with tensor-product structure. Sharp features can be retained in this representation by using geometrically redundant edges in the planar-cut polyhedron. The resulting surface follows the outlines of the planar-cut polyhedron in the manner traditional tensor-product splines follow the outline of their rectilinear control polyhedron. In particular, it stays in the local convex hull of the planar-cut polyhedron.

INTRODUCTION Polyhedra can be smoothed into free-form surfaces using a variety of approaches such as rational blends, generalized subdivision or simplex splines (see e.g. [3], <ref> [1] </ref>, [2]). A major criticism leveled at these techniques is that they are incompatible, i.e. cannot be represented exactly or efficiently in the dominant patch representation, tensor-product B-splines.

Reference-contexts: A general algorithm for generating a planar-cut polyhedron can be found in [6] pp 649-650. The code provided with this paper is an independent module and does not require the data structures for maintaining polyhedra. Such data structures, e.g. the half-edge data structure, can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. Also many commercially available modeling environments provide the necessary functionality for maintaining a planar-cut polyhedron. When generating the planar-cut polyhedron, interpolation and curvature properties of the surface can be controlled.

Reference-contexts: By rotating and linearly clipping the domain, each group can be represented as one linearly-trimmed, bicubic, tensor-product NURBS patch. The increased flexibility provided by the internal second-order knot lines of the trimmed patches results in better surface parametrizations than bicubic or even biquartic Bernstein-Bezier patches (cf. Theorem 2 of <ref> [5] </ref>). In particular, this construction guarantees tangent plane continuity, the strong convex hull property, locality and affine invariance. The patches join seamlessly with tensor-product bi-quadratic patches obtained by interpreting nine points forming four quadrilaterals in the planar-cut polyhedron as a B-spline control net.

Reference-contexts: Tensor-product B-splines serve under the pseudonym NURBS as a standard for storage, transmission and high-level rendering. However, NURBS impose a rectilinear, checkerboard-like surface-layout unsuitable for modeling arbitrarily laid out facets of general free-form surfaces. The incompatibility criticism seems also to apply to surface splines proposed in <ref> [6] </ref>, because surface splines employ three-sided surface pieces rather than the four-sided tensor-product pieces. The routine Pcp2Nurb described in this paper overcomes this barrier by efficiently and exactly representing collections of surface-spline pieces as linearly-trimmed, regularly parametrized NURBS patches. <p> underlying the algorithm and code is discussed in [7]: "Smoothing Polyhedra made Easy" where the coefficients of three-sided, cubic, C 1 connected patches are expressed as simple averages of a planar-cut polyhedron (see Section 3.1 for the definition of planar-cut polyhedron.) As a special case, the surface splines described in <ref> [6] </ref> always group together four three-sided patches as shown in Figure 2. By rotating and linearly clipping the domain, each group can be represented as one linearly-trimmed, bicubic, tensor-product NURBS patch. <p> The patches join seamlessly with tensor-product bi-quadratic patches obtained by interpreting nine points forming four quadrilaterals in the planar-cut polyhedron as a B-spline control net. The transition between the trimmed bicubic patches and the biquadratic patches is automatically tangent continuous (cf. <ref> [6] </ref>, p 654). 4 J. Peters Fig. 3.

There are many strategies for generating a planar-cut polyhedron. The most efficient strategy will depend on the particular class of surfaces modeled.
