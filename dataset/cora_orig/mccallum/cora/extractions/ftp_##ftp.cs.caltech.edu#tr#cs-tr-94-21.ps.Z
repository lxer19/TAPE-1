Abstract: We introduce the concept of energy per operation as a measure of performance of an asynchronous circuit. We show how to model energy consumption based on the high-level language specification. This model is independent of voltage and timing considerations. We apply this model to memory design. We show first how to dimension a memory array, and how to break up this memory array into smaller arrays to minimize the energy per access. We then show how to use cache memory and pre-fetch mechanisms to further reduce energy per access.

Reference-contexts: The optimum energy per access, E 2D;R (n; b) is: E 2D;R (n; b) = n (log 2 n + 2b + 1) (20) A memory designed for speed usually has l = b fi w <ref> [1] </ref>. A completely square bit-array optimizes the access time per bit, but does not take into account the energy savings derived from selecting only the bits that are part of the desired word. This extra selection step takes time and area, and saves energy.

Reference-contexts: The same type of information can be used to decrease the average energy per access.

Spacial locality indicates that, once an address has been accessed, there is a strong probability that nearby addresses will be accessed in the near future.

The CHP specification of an asynchronous circuit corresponds very closely to its implementation; for each assignment, communication, function evaluation executed by the CHP program there will be a corresponding assignment, communication, function evaluation computed by the CMOS implementation.

This metric measures the energy required to execute an instruction, fetch a piece of data from memory, service an interrupt, etc.

Reference-contexts: Leakage currents come from the sub-threshold behavior of MOSFET's. For V GS &lt; V th , the channel conductance, g c , can be modeled by <ref> [11] </ref>: g c = I c kT kT (2) All these currents add up, and are responsible for an energy dissipation of the form E s = V 2 q exp kT dt (3) where V GS = 0 is assumed.

Reference-contexts: Short-circuit currents originate in the short transients, as in the case of a CMOS inverter, when both pull-up and pull-down transistors conduct while the input signal switches between V thn and V DD V thp . This energy dissipation has the form <ref> [12] </ref>: E sc = s i (V DD 2V th ) (4) where the s i 's are proportionality constants, and the sum is made over all transitions executed in one operation. Short-circuit currents also play a significant role in storing a value into a flip-flop built from cross-coupled inverters.

Reference-contexts: can be derived from that program. 4.2 Multi-bank memory array We can further reduce the energy per access by breaking up the memory into several sub-arrays, so that only one of the smaller sub-arrays is accessed in each memory reference; this technique is also known as the divided word-line method <ref> [13] </ref>. We obtain the CHP for the multi-banked memory by applying a divide-and-conquer strategy to the MEM program.
