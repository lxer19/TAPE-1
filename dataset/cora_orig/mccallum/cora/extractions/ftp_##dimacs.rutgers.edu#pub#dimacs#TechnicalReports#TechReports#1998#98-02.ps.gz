Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper is a follow-up of <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, where we report on some results related to ternary Hamming spaces and, in particular, to generators and their properties. We recall from [2] some basic definitions and notation 1 . The n-dimensional ternary Hamming space is T n , where T = f0; 1; 2g. <p> Let us call a subset G T n a generating set, or in short a generator if G fl = T n . In our previous paper <ref> [1] </ref> we proved the following sharp lower bound on the size of a generator. Theorem 1 For every generating set G T n we have jGj 2 n . In this paper we keep on with the study of generating sets, concentrating on some computational problems related to them.
