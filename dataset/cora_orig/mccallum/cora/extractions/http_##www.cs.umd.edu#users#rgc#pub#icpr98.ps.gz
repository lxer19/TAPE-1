Abstract: We describe a new technique that detects periodic motion. Assuming a static camera, we first segment moving objects from the background. By tracking objects of interest, we compute the object's self-similarity as it evolves in time. For periodic motion, the self-similarity metric is periodic, and is Fourier analyzed to detect and characterize periodicity. Examples on real image sequences are given.

Reference-contexts: Examples include walking, a waving hand, a rotating wheel, and a flying bird. Knowing that an object's motion is periodic is a strong cue for object recognition. In addition, periodic motion can also aid in tracking objects. Furthermore, the periodic motion of people can be used to recognize individuals <ref> [1] </ref>. There has been recent interest in segmenting and analyzing cyclic or periodic motion ([5], [6], [9], [12], [10], [4]).

Reference-contexts: The object O's self-similarity is then computed at times t 1 and t 2 . While many image similarity metrics can be defined (e.g., [11], <ref> [2] </ref>), perhaps the simplest is: S (t 1 ; t 2 ) = min jdx;dyjr X j O t 1 (x + dx; y + dy) O t 2 (x; y) j where B O t 1 is the bounding box of O t 1 .

Reference-contexts: In addition, an alternative to using Fourier analysis to analyze the periodicity is to analyze the peaks of the autocorrelation of S, which are more prominent than the peaks in the Fourier spectrum <ref> [3] </ref>. Finally, additional image similarity metrics can be used, perhaps using normalized color spaces to account for lighting changes.

Reference-contexts: In estimating the power, S is linearly detrended and a Hanning filter is applied. A more accurate spectrum is estimated by averaging the spectra of multiple t 1 's <ref> [7] </ref> to get a final power estimate P (f ), where f is the frequency. Periodic motion will show up as peaks in this spectra at the motion's fundamental frequencies.

Reference-contexts: To detect periodicity for each object, we first align the segmented object (for each frame) using the object's centroid, and resize the objects (using a Mitchell filter <ref> [8] </ref>) so that they all have the same dimensions. The object O's self-similarity is then computed at times t 1 and t 2 .

Our work differs in that we track objects and segment the background, which allows detection of non-stationary cyclic motion. In addition, while <ref> [10] </ref> assumes global cyclic motion for objects they analyze, we analyze sub-regions of the object to determine which parts of the objects have cyclic motion.
