Abstract: We present a new algorithm for exact two-level logic optimization. It differs from the classical approach; rather than generating the set of all prime implicants of a function, and then deriving a covering problem, we derive the covering problem directly and implicitly, and then generate only those primes involved in the covering problem. We represent a set of primes by the cube of their intersection. The set of sets of primes which forms the covering problem is unique. Hence the corresponding set of cubes forms a canonical cover. We give a successive reduction algorithm for finding the canonical cover from any initial cover, we then generate only those primes involved in at least one minimal cover. The method is effective; solutions for 10 of the 20 hard examples in the Espresso benchmark set are derived and proved minimum. For 5 of the remaining examples the canonical cover is derived, but the covering problem remains to be solved exactly.

Reference-contexts: We have devised a method to compute signature cube (d) of cube d using the blocking function introduced in <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> From the proposition 3.5.2 in <ref> [1] </ref>, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of cubes of P d and the set of primes containing d.

Reference-contexts: We also report results on 20 "hard" examples (ones on which Espresso-exact failed). These examples are noteworthy for having many primes. Indeed, Coud-ert and Madre <ref> [2] </ref> report that some have as many as 10,000,000 primes. Despite this, the Essential Signature Set (number of columns of the reduced covering table) for many of these is small. <p> Despite this, the Essential Signature Set (number of columns of the reduced covering table) for many of these is small. In the table 1, we report the name, number of inputs and outputs, number of terms in the given problem, number of primes (found by <ref> [2] </ref>), number of essential primes, number of essential signature cubes (number of sets or rows of the final covering problem), number of primes in some essential signature set (number of columns of the final covering problem), the ratio of number of columns in the reduced covering table to the number of
