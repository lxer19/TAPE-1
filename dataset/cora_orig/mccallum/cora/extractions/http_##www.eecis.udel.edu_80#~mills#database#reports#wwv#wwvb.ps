Reference-contexts: The first step is second synchronization recovery. From standard analysis <ref> [1] </ref>, the 400-Hz bandpass filter and 5-ms matched filter provide an SNR improvement of 10log (2 T s B ), where B = 2100 Hz is the input bandwidth and T s = 5 ms is the integration time, or 10.2 dB. <p> This is a conservative bound, since the median filter corrects a sin gle error. Selection of the center sample amounts to detection of an on-off keyed (OOK) wave 12 form, which has bit error rate <ref> [1] </ref>. For the assumed P = .075, the SNR must be greater than 3.2 dB. Since the 1-s sync pulse is transmitted at 100 per cent carrier modulation, which is 3 dB below the carrier power, the minimum SNR at P e 3 + 3.2 -27.3 = -21.1 dB.

At the time of year the tests were performed, the propagation path between the WWV transmitter at Boulder, CO, and the radio at Newark, DE, is open from middle morning to late evening in Newark.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The work described in this report continues similar work described in a previous report <ref> [3] </ref>. That report describes a software program that implements an optimal linear demodulator and decoder for direct-printing radiotelegraph signals commonly used by amateur and commercial stations in the shortwave radio spectrum. <p> At the heart of the program is a circular buffer which holds input samples from the ADC before processing by the program and output samples from the program before output to the DAC. The buffering strategy, adapted from <ref> [3] </ref>, is designed to relieve the programmer from intricate loop unrolling and decimating. Most of the interrupt, buffering, command interpretation and storage management functions were incorporated intact from the high performance modem program described in [3] and will not be described further here. <p> The buffering strategy, adapted from <ref> [3] </ref>, is designed to relieve the programmer from intricate loop unrolling and decimating.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the stations transmit a time-of-century digital timecode designed for displays and other electronic media. Only the time-code and related pulses at 100, 1000 and 1200 Hz are used by the DSP clock. The WWV signal format is described in <ref> [5] </ref>. It consists of three elements, a 5-ms, 1000-Hz pulse, which occurs at the beginning of each second, a 800-ms, 1000-Hz pulse, which occurs at the beginning of each minute, and a pulse-width modulated 100-Hz subcarrier, which carries the data bits.

Reference-contexts: Previously, TAPR developed the packet radio technology commonly used by for-profit firms manufacturing inexpensive VHF and UHF wireless modems. The DSP-93 includes a Texas Instruments (TI) TMS320C25 DSP chip <ref> [6] </ref> and various interface chips for analog/digital conversion, radio control and serial input/output interface to the PC. The TMS320C25 uses a 16-bit pipelined design and operates with a 40-MHz clock and 10 MIPS instruction rate.
