Title: Equational Axiomatizability for Hidden Algebra and Coalgebra  
Author: Grigore Ro~su 
Address: San Diego  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Engineering, University of California at  
Abstract: A characterization result for behaviorally definable classes of hidden algebras shows that a class of hidden algebras is behaviorally definable by equations if and only if it is closed under coproducts, quotients, morphisms and representative inclusions. The second part of the paper categorically generalizes this result to a framework of any category with coproducts, a final object and an inclusion system; this is general enough to include all coalgebra categories of interest. As a technical issue, the notions of equation and satisfaction are axiomatized in order to include the different approaches in the literature.

Later, his results were abstracted categorically to catch other modern approaches to equational logics and even first order logic (for example <ref> [1, 16, 17] </ref>). Hidden algebra [9, 11, 10] appeared as a generalization of many-sorted algebra, in order to give algebraic semantics for the object paradigm. It allows hidden and visible sorts, and satisfaction is behavioral with respect to visible experiments.

Reference-contexts: This elegant and natural approach to equational logics allowed universal algebra (and especially its generalizations to many-sorted algebra and order-sorted algebra) to be very suitable for semantics of equational-logic-based specification languages. Starting with Birkhoff <ref> [2] </ref>, mathematicians were interested in the definitional power of equations, i.e., in characterization results for classes of algebras containing exactly all algebras which satisfy a given set of equations.

Reference-contexts: Some coalgebraic aspects of hidden algebra (such as that the forgetful functor from hidden algebras to sets is a left adjoint [4] and there is a final hidden algebra reflecting the behavior of every other hidden algebra <ref> [3, 9] </ref>) make us believe that a dual result to the Birkhoff characterization should hold for hidden algebra.

Hidden -algebras form a category, denoted HAlg , in which morphisms are ordinary (many-sorted) morphisms which are identities on data.
