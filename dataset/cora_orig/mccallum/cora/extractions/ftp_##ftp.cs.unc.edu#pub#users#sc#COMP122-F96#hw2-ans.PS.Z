Abstract: Practice problems P-1 Show that for any real constants a and b, where b &gt; 0, (n + a) b = fi(n b ): Solution: To show that (n + a) b = fi(n b ), we want to find constants c 1 , c 2 , n 0 &gt; 0 such that 0 c 1 n b (n + a) b c 2 n b 8n n 0 : Note that n + a n + jaj 2n when jaj n and Solution: By the definition of factorials and logarithms, we have lg(n!) = lg( i=1 = i=1 = lg e i=1 To show that lg(n!) = fi(n lg n), we need to find constants c 1 , c 2 , n 0 &gt; 0 such that 0 c 1 n lg n lg(n!) c 2 n lg n8n n 0 :
