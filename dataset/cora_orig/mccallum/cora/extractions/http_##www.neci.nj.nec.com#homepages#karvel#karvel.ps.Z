Abstract: We use generalized particle trajectories to derive an analytic expression characterizing the probability distribution of boundary-completion shape. This is essential to the understanding of the perceptual phenomenon of illusory (subjective) contours. The particles' dynamics include Poisson-distributed ensembles of driving forces as well as particle decay. The resulting field, representing completed surface boundaries, is characterized by the fraction of particles at x with velocity

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The phenomenon of illusory contours is much studied by visual psychologists and provides a compelling example of human visual competence not yet demonstrated by computer vision systems. Recently, a novel theory of illusory contour shape and salience has appeared. Williams and Jacobs <ref> [7] </ref> defined the illusory contour shape and salience problem to be the problem of computing the the shape and relative likelihood (as determined by the prior probability distribution) of the family of curves which potentially connect (or complete) a set of contrast edges. <p> g: f (x; _x) = C (x; _x) dx d _xC (x; _x) where C (x; _x) = i=1 M 1 (x; _x j x i ; _x i ) j=1 M 2 (x j ; _x j j x; _x) is the stochastic completion field of Williams and Jacobs <ref> [7] </ref> and M 1 (x; _x j x i ; _x i ) = 1 dt 1 P (x; _x; t 3 j x i ; _x i ; t 1 )I i (t 1 ) R 1 represent the contributions of each keypoint to what they refer to as the <p> This corresponds to letting particles decay with an average rate of 1=t 21 .

This was accomplished by exploiting the fact that the stochastic completion field can be computed directly as the product of two vector-field convolutions. <p> _x 1 = 1, _y 1 = 0, _x 2 = cos and _y 2 = sin in the expression for P (2 j 1) and numerically integrating the result over the independent variable representing total transit time (i.e., t 21 ) using Simpson's method. 5 Because the original treatment <ref> [7] </ref> used particles with a finite half-life, we used a time weighting function Q 21 (t 21 ) of the form exp (t 21 =t 21 ). <p> In contrast with the Monte Carlo method, where it is 4 By contrast (x 3 ) 2 is maximal at mid-trajectory. 5 We have also approximated this integral analytically using the method of steepest descent (see Appendix B). figure computed using method of <ref> [7] </ref> (summed over all orientations). <p> This distribution is meant to represent an Ehrenstein figure (see Figure 3 (left)). The keypoints are located at endpoints of the four line segments comprising the figure and are oriented normal to the segments.

The magnitudes are summed over the 36 discrete orientations so that the stochastic completion field can be displayed as a brightness image. <p> The second demonstration is the well known Kanizsa triangle [3] (see Figure 3 (right)). The source distribution consisted of a set of oriented impulses representing the orientations of contours bounding regions of constant brightness at positive maxima of curvature (see <ref> [7] </ref>). In general, these are points where it is likely that one surface occludes another. Figure 5 (left) shows the stochastic completion field from [7] (summed over all orientations). For illustrative purposes, it is superimposed on the brightness gradient magnitude image. <p> The source distribution consisted of a set of oriented impulses representing the orientations of contours bounding regions of constant brightness at positive maxima of curvature (see <ref> [7] </ref>).

This suggests that the method of Williams and Jacobs <ref> [7] </ref> is robust with respect to the choice of this parameter. Finally, stochastic completion fields for two illusory contour figures from the literature were computed using convolution kernels generated by both the Monte Carlo method and by numerical integration of the analytic expression.
