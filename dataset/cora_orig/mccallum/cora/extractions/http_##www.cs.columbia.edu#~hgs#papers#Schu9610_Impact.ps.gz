Reference-contexts: The average number of bytes per month is increasing due to a number of factors, including continuous-media applications that do not require interaction with the computer. 1 The current guidelines for ISPs <ref> [1] </ref> suggest a ratio of 200 28.8 kb/s lines for a T1 connection, with a ratio of 10:1 subscribers to modem lines for a larger ISP.

Reference-contexts: The lower burstiness of packet audio and video, however, allows for higher network utilization for the same amount of buffering. While congestion control for point-to-point bulk and interactive data are well established (if only recently formally written down <ref> [2] </ref>), the control of continuous-media applications is an open problem, with some initial experiments [3, 4, 5], but no established algorithms.

Reference-contexts: If anything, other competitive communications services are moving into that direction: witness the disappearance of distance as a factor of long-distance telephony <ref> [6] </ref> or the popularity of flat-rate (10c/minute anywhere) long-distance services, with very little dependence on time-of-day.
