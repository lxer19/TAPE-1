Abstract Several recent problem-solving programs have indicated improved methods for controlling program actions. Some of these methods operate by analyzing the time-independent antecedent-consequent dependency relationships between the components of knowledge about the problem for solution. This paper is a revised version of a thesis proposal which indicates how a general system of automatically maintained dependency relationships can be used to effect many forms of control on reasoning in an antecedent reasoning framework.
