Title: UFLIC: A Line Integral Convolution Algorithm For Visualizing Unsteady Flows  
Author: Han-Wei Shen David L. Kao 
Affiliation: MRJ Technology Solutions NASA Ames Research Center NASA Ames Research Center  
Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm, UFLIC (Unsteady Flow LIC), to visualize vector data in unsteady flow fields. Using the Line Integral Convolution(LIC) as theunderlyingmethod, a new convolution algorithm is proposed that can effectively trace the flow's global features over time. The new algorithm consists of a time-accurate value depositing scheme and a successive feed-forward method. The value depositingscheme accurately models the flow advection, and the successive feed-forward method maintains the coherence between animation frames. Our new algorithm can produce time-accurate, highly coherent flow animations to highlight global features in unsteady flow fields. CFD scientists, for the first time, are able to visualize unsteadysurface flows using our algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The other method is the time-dependent method which can better characterize the evolution of the flow field by continuously tracking the visualization results over time. Examples are streaklines and pathlines computed fromunsteady flow data [4, 5]. Thispaper presentsa timedependentmethodfor visualizing vector datain unsteadyflowfields. UsingtheLineIntegral Convolution (LIC) <ref> [1] </ref> as the underlying method, we propose a new convolution algorithm, called UFLIC (Unsteady FlowLIC), to accurately model the unsteady flow advection. <p> We then present our UFLIC algorithm. We conclude this paper by presenting results of applying our method to several unsteady flow data sets from CFD simulations. 2 Background and Related Work In this section, we briefly review the LIC method proposed by Cabral and Leedom <ref> [1] </ref>. We then describe and analyze the method proposed by Forssell and Cohen [2] for unsteady flow field data. 2.1 Line Integral Convolution The Line Integral Convolution method is a texture synthesis technique that can be usedto visualize vector field data. <p> As a result, the output intensity values of the LIC pixels along each streamline are strongly correlated so the global features of the flow field can be easily visualized. To perform the convolution, different periodic filter kernels can be used. Examples are the Hanning filter <ref> [1] </ref> and the box filter [8][7]. Recently, several extensions to the original LIC algorithm have been proposed. Forssell and Cohen [2] adapt the LIC methodfor curvilinear grid data. StallingandHege [8] propose 1 As described in their paper. <p> First, wepresent a time-accurate value depositing scheme. Next, we discuss a successive feed-forward method. The combination of these two techniques canprovide effectivespatial andtemporalcoherence for tracking dynamic flowfeatures. 3.1 Time-Accurate Value Depositing The convolution method proposed originally by Cabral and Leedom <ref> [1] </ref> uses a value gathering scheme. In this algorithm, each pixel in the field travels in both positive and negative streamline directions to gather pixel values and compute the convolution. Stalling and Hege [8] propose a different approach for speeding up the computation. <p> The advantage of using this global life span to control the convolution length is that the lengths of different pathlines can be automatically scaled to be proportional to the velocity magnitudes, which is a desirable effect as described in <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. It is worth mentioning that in our method, each pixel deposits its value along only the forward pathline direction but not the backward direction. This is because the backward depositing does not correspond to actual physical phenomena in practice (flows do not advect backwards). <p> This is because the backward depositing does not correspond to actual physical phenomena in practice (flows do not advect backwards). In addition, the symmetry issue mentioned in <ref> [1] </ref> does not appear as a problemin our unsteadyflowanimations. To receive the deposits, each pixel keeps a "bucket" which stores deposits from different seeds at different time. In Figure 2 (a), pixels A, B, and C have pathlines stepping through C.

Reference-contexts: While this method is effective, it is primarily for steady flow data. Forssell and Cohen <ref> [2] </ref> propose an exten sion using a streakline convolution 1 for the time-varying vector field. However, several problems associated with the algorithm, such as obscure coherence within and among the output image frames and less accurate temporal manipulation, greatly limit its effectiveness in practice. <p> We then describe and analyze the method proposed by Forssell and Cohen <ref> [2] </ref> for unsteady flow field data. 2.1 Line Integral Convolution The Line Integral Convolution method is a texture synthesis technique that can be usedto visualize vector field data. Taking a vectorfieldanda whitenoiseimageastheinput,thealgorithm uses a low pass filter to perform one-dimensional convolution on the noise image. <p> To perform the convolution, different periodic filter kernels can be used.

However, in a strict sense, their convolution follows pathlines of advected particles. an efficient convolution method to speed up the LIC computation. <p> To visualize unsteady flow data, Forssell and Cohen propose an extension <ref> [2] </ref>. In contrast with convolving streamlines in the steady flow field, the algorithmconvolvesforwardandbackwardpathlinesoriginated fromeach pixel at everytime step. A pathline is the path that a particle travels through the unsteady flow field in time. <p> The advantage of using this global life span to control the convolution length is that the lengths of different pathlines can be automatically scaled to be proportional to the velocity magnitudes, which is a desirable effect as described in <ref> [1, 2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Shen, Johnson, and Ma [7] combine dye advection with three dimensional LIC to visualize global and local flow features at the same time.

The texture outputs from the Line Integral Convolution method provide an excellent visual representation of the flow field. This effectiveness generally comes fromtwo types of coherence.
