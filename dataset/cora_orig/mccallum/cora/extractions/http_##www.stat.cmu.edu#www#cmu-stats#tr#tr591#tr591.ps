Title: Dynamic Three-dimensional Display of U.S. Air Traffic  
Author: William F. Eddy Shingo Oue 
Date: March 24, 1994  
Affiliation: Carnegie Mellon University  
Abstract: We describe methods developed to interpolate and project flight paths of aircraft in controlled airspace over the continental US from aperiodic position reports. There are a number of unusual features of the dynamic displays we have developed. Our visualizations can be viewed from either a fixed or moving viewpoint. The direction and distance of the focal point from the viewing point is under program control (allowing viewing in a direction other than the direction of motion of the viewpoint). The maximum and minimum depth of field is under program control (allowing viewing of selected local subsets of the data). fl Eddy is Professor of Statistics and Oue is a graduate student, Department of Statistics, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890. We appreciate helpful comments from Michael Meyer. y Partially supported by ONR Contract N00014-91-J-1024 and the Bureau of the Census under Joint Statistical Agreement JSA91-25.

Reference-contexts: In Section 5, we discuss the extension of our navigation method to general multivariate datasets of more than three dimensions. Our approach can be thought of as an extension of tour methods such as the Grand Tour (Asimov <ref> [1] </ref>) and Motion Graphics (Hurley and Buja [6]). Because of the size of the data set and the complexity of the calculations we did not attempt to create the dynamic graphics interactively. Rather we used single-frame video recording techniques to create the video tapes in a batch processing mode. <p> One widely adopted strategy is using real time rotation, that is, changing, in a continuous manner, the planes on which the data are projected. Asimov <ref> [1] </ref> proposed the grand tour which constructs a sequence of projection planes which satisfy several desirable properties such as continuity, uniformity and denseness among all two-dimensional subspaces in IR d . A drawback of the grand tour is that it may be very time-consuming to find interesting structures in datasets. <p> With the lack of user interface, we just have to wait until the tour hits right spots. For example, in six dimensions, a theoretical lower bound for the number of planes which can be chosen so that all possible planes lie within 20 10 degrees is 6,000,000 (Asimov <ref> [1] </ref>). The Guided Tour (Hurley and Buja [6]) is designed to construct a sequence under user control by interpolating between consecutive elements of a user-chosen subset of planes (called target planes).

Reference-contexts: We intend to continue that work but we have become interested in the local aspect of the dynamic displays we have developed and are now focussing on the generalization of that aspect. See Cleveland and McGill <ref> [2] </ref>. There are several new findings which are seen in the examples with a moving viewpoint which demonstrate the potential of our dynamic localization. Here, we discuss an extension of our method to general multivariate data with dimension more than three.

Reference-contexts: Another approach to design a tour is visiting interesting projections. Xgobi has the capability to search interesting low-dimensional projections via the optimization of projection pursuit indices (Cook, Buja, and Cabrera <ref> [3] </ref>). The tour follows the steepest ascent of a index so that the viewer visits its local optima. While all those tools mentioned above concern global projected images, it is natural for us to think of their dynamic localization versions which we would call navigations instead of tours.

The Guided Tour (Hurley and Buja <ref> [6] </ref>) is designed to construct a sequence under user control by interpolating between consecutive elements of a user-chosen subset of planes (called target planes). This user-guided target selection is achieved by 1. choosing constraints on target planes, 2. choosing a sequence constructor that decides the way to arrange target planes.

Reference-contexts: Now suppose the objects of our interest are in IR d with d &gt; 3. Even for a high dimensional case, projection is one of the most preferred methods because of its excellent ability to preserve low-dimensional information. Other approaches include, e.g., the parallel coordinate plot. (See, e.g., Wegman <ref> [7] </ref>.) However, it is very difficult to supply the lost (d 2)-dimensional information in a single static view even for d = 4. One widely adopted strategy is using real time rotation, that is, changing, in a continuous manner, the planes on which the data are projected.
