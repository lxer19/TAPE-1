Abstract: Integrating data from heterogeneous data sources is a critical problem that has received a great deal of attention in recent years. There are two competing approaches to address this problem. The traditional approach, which first appeared in Multibase and more recently in HERMES and TSIMMIS, defines the global model as a view on the sources. A more recent approach, sometimes referred to as view rewriting, defines the sources as views on the global model. The disadvantage of the first approach is that a person must reengineer the definitions of the global model whenever any of the sources change or when new sources are added. The view rewriting approach does not suffer from this problem, but the problem of rewriting queries into equivalent plans using views is computationally hard and must be performed for each query at run-time. In this paper we propose a hybrid approach that amortizes the cost of query processing over all queries by pre-compiling the source descriptions into axioms. Using this approach, the sources are defined in terms of the global model and then compiled into axioms that define the global model in terms of the sources. These axioms can be efficiently instantiated at run-time to determine the most appropriate rewriting to answer a query. This approach combines the flexibility of the view rewriting with the run-time efficiency of the query processing in systems such as Multibase. We have implemented this approach in the SIMS information mediator and provide empirical results that demonstrate its effectiveness in several application domains. fl The research reported here was supported in part by the Rome Laboratory of the Air Force Systems Command and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under contract number F30602-97-2-0352, by USC's Integrated Media Systems Center (IMSC) an NSF Engineering Research Center, by the Defense Logistics Agency, DARPA, and Fort Huachuca under contract number DABT63-96-C-0066, and by a research grant from General Dynamics Information Systems.

Reference-contexts: An information mediator provides seamless access to a collection of related, but possibly heterogeneous and distributed data sources. There are a variety of approaches to building information mediators, illustrated by different approaches used in systems such as TSIMMIS [13], Garlic [12, 22], HERMES <ref> [1] </ref>, Information Manifold [20], InfoSleuth [14], and SIMS [5, 6], to name a few. <p> The first approach, which has been widely used, is to integrate the sources by defining the global schema as a collection of views (queries) over the sources. This general approach 18 has been used in a variety of systems, including Multibase [15], Pegasus [2], TSIMMIS [13], and HERMES <ref> [1] </ref>. An advantage is that the query rewriting algorithms are very efficient. The rewriting consists of substituting domain terms by their definitions, and simplifying the resulting source-level queries.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we focus on the first problem (also known as source selection) for a mediator with an expressive language for describing the contents of sources. In a separate paper we present our approach to generating query plans using a cost-based optimizer <ref> [4] </ref>, which takes advantage of the source selection techniques presented here.

Reference-contexts: The approach presented in this paper can be viewed as a combination of sources modeled as views on the domain model (e.g., Information Manifold [20]) and the domains classes modeled as views on the source models <ref> [15] </ref>. The advantage of the former approach (also known as view rewriting) is that each source is modeled independently of all the other sources, so new sources can be added and existing sources can be modified without changing the domain model. <p> The first approach, which has been widely used, is to integrate the sources by defining the global schema as a collection of views (queries) over the sources.

Reference-contexts: An advantage of this method is that modifying the definitions or adding new sources is quite straightforward because each source is defined independently from others. A disadvantage is that the algorithms to rewrite a domain-level query into a source-level query involves testing containment of views, which is computationally expensive <ref> [17, 16] </ref>. The work presented in this paper combines the best of both approaches. Initially, sources are conveniently defined in domain terms, so that new sources are easily incorporated or updated. <p> The two approaches could be combined by first using our work to represent the sources and determine how to combine the relevant sources and then using the Garlic approach to estimate the cost of the different plans and select the most efficient one. The Information Manifold (IM) <ref> [17, 16] </ref> also provides a rich representation languages that is combination of datalog and description logic. However, view rewriting in its language is intractable and can become undecidable in the presence of recursion [18, 19].

Reference-contexts: The rewriting consists of substituting domain terms by their definitions, and simplifying the resulting source-level queries. A disadvantage is that adding or modifying a source can be quite difficult: all definitions in which that source appears have to be manually reconsidered. The second approach, exemplified by the Information Manifold <ref> [17] </ref>, is to define each data source as a view of the global domain model. Specifically, each source predicate is defined as a view over domain predicates. <p> An advantage of this method is that modifying the definitions or adding new sources is quite straightforward because each source is defined independently from others. A disadvantage is that the algorithms to rewrite a domain-level query into a source-level query involves testing containment of views, which is computationally expensive <ref> [17, 16] </ref>.

The domain model establishes a fixed vocabulary describing object classes, their attributes, and the relationships among them. SIMS accepts queries in this high-level uniform language, processes these queries, and returns the requested data.
