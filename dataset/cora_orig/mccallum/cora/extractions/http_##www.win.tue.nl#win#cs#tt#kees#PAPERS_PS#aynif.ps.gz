Abstract: Over the last few years, simulating the motion of linked articulated rigid bodies based on classical rigid body dynamics has become a valuable paradigm for making realistic 3-D computer animations. Although several operational methods for dynamical simulation have been developed, in general these are both conceptually and computationally complex. To inspire further research in devising alternative and possibly simpler schemes for dealing with articulated rigid bodies, this paper discusses an alternative approach to rigid body dynamics which is based on (conceptually much simpler) point mechanics. Geometric constraints, e.g. the requirement that the distance between two points should be conserved, take the form of additional algebraic equations. We propose to solve these algebraic constraints in concert with the numerical integration. First, we give a general formulation of such a scheme. Next, we describe a preliminar implementation on the basis of a very naive numerical solver for ODE's (ordinary differential equations).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction (The first few paragraphs of this introductionhave appeared earlier, in a different context, in <ref> [8] </ref>) The mathematical theory of rigid body dynamics has been developed over the past 200 years by Euler, Lagrange, Poincelet and others. One of the main applications of this theory was the quantitative description of motions of celestial bodies.
