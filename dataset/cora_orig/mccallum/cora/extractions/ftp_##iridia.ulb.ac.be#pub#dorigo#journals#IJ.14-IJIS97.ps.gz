Abstract: Q-learning can greatly improve its convergence speed if helped by immediate reinforcements provided by a trainer able to judge the usefulness of actions as stage setting with respect to the goal of the agent. This paper experimentally investigates this hypothesis studying the integration of immediate reinforcements (also called training reinforcements) with standard delayed reinforcements (namely, reinforcements assigned only when the agent-environment relationship reaches a peculiar state, such as when the agent reaches a target). The paper proposes two new algorithms (TL and MTL) able to exploit even locally wrong and misleading training reinforcements. The proposed algorithms are tested against Q-learning and other
