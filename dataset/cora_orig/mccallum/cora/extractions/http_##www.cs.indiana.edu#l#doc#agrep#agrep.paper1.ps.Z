Reference-contexts: In this paper we present a new algorithm which is very fast in practice, reasonably simple to implement, and supports a large number of variations of the approximate string-matching problem. The algorithm is based on a numeric scheme for exact string matching developed by Baeza-Yates and Gonnet <ref> [BG89] </ref> (See also [BG91]). The algorithm can handle several variations of measures and most of the common types of queries, including arbitrary regular expressions. <p> Agrep is available through anonymous ftp from cs.arizona.edu. 3 2. The Algorithm We first describe the case of exact string matching. The algorithm for this case is identical with that of Baeza-Yates and Gonnet <ref> [BG89] </ref>. We then show how to extend the algorithm to search with errors. We then describe how to speed up the search with errors by using an exact search most of the time. 2.1. Exact Matching Let R be a bit array of size m (the size of the pattern). <p> Other fast string-matching algorithms avoid the need to maintain the whole array by storing only the best match so far and some more information that depends on the pattern. The main observation about this transition, due to Baeza-Yates and Gonnet <ref> [BG89] </ref>, is that it can be computed very fast in practice as follows. Let the alphabet be S = s 1 ,s 2 ,...,s | S | . <p> We assume that the right shift fills the first position with a 1. If only 0-filled shifts are available (as is the case with C), then we can add one more OR operation with a mask that has one bit. (Baeza-Yates and Gonnet <ref> [BG89] </ref> used 0 to indicate a match and an OR operation instead of an AND; that way, 0-filled shifts are sufficient. This is counterintuitive to explain, so we opted for the easier definition.) An example is given in Figure 1a, where the pattern is aabac and the text is aabaacaabacab. <p> Matching With Errors We now show how to adapt the previous algorithm to allow errors. (Baeza-Yates and Gonnet <ref> [BG89] </ref> showed how to handle only mismatches by essentially counting k of them with a log 2 k size counter, but they did not handle insertions or deletions.) We start with a very simple case: only one insertion is allowed into the pattern at any position. <p> The algorithm can be extended to support any regular expression. We discuss regular expressions briefly in section 3.8. 3.1. Sets of Characters Replacing one character with a set of allowable characters is very easy to achieve with this algorithm (as was shown by Baeza-Yates and Gonnet <ref> [BG89] </ref>). Suppose that the pattern we want to find is P 1 followed by one digit followed by P 2 and that we allow up to k errors. We denote this pattern by P 1 [0-9]P 2 .
