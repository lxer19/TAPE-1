Title: Searle, Subsymbolic Functionalism and Synthetic Intelligence  
Author: Diane Law 
Abstract: Department of Computer Sciences The University of Texas at Austin dianelaw@cs.utexas.edu Technical Report AI94-222 June 1994 Abstract John Searles Chinese Room argument raises many important questions for traditional, symbolic AI, which none of the standard replies adequately refutes. Even so, the argument does not necessarily imply that machines will never be truly able to think. Nevertheless, we must be willing to make some changes to the foundations of traditional AI in order to answer Searles questions satisfactorily. This paper argues that if we constrain the sorts of architectures we consider as appropriate models of the mind other than the brain, such that they resemble the physical structure of the brain more closely, we gain several desirable properties. It is possible that these properties may help us solve the hard problems of intentionality, qualia and consciousness that Computational Functionalism has so far not been able to address in satisfactory ways.

Reference-contexts: From these remarks, it is clear that Searles complaints are chiefly with the Computational Functionalists or the adherents of traditional, symbolic AI. Of course there are many standard philosophical criticisms of functionalism <ref> (Bechtel, 1988, Churchland, 1986) </ref> and it is not the aim of this paper to repeat them all here. Still it is important to note that the foundation of this school of thought is a complete reliance on symbolic processing. <p> Yet when we look at the traditional definitions of Computational Functionalism as a philosophical stance, we see that it views the mind as carrying out formal operations on symbols encoded within it <ref> (Bechtel, 1988) </ref>. This gives us a great deal of latitude in terms of the sorts of machines we have at our disposal for implementation of the algorithms we hypothesize that the brain is carrying out.
