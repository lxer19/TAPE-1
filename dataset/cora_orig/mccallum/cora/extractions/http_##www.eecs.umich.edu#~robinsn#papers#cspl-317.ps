Reference-contexts: There are several important elements that distinguish the approach described in this report from previous approaches. First, a smooth continuously parameterizable boundary model is used which permits sub-pixel boundary resolution. Second, the boundary Fisher information matrix (FIM) <ref> [18] </ref> is used to specify a priori boundary estimator accuracy. The FIM specifies a lower bound on the covariance of the boundary estimate and also plays a key role in simplifying the implementation of the minimax uptake estimator. <p> F is the Fisher information matrix <ref> [18] </ref>, [28] given by F = E r T fl fi ln f (Y M ; ) ; where r is a row gradient vector and r 2 = r T r is a Hessian matrix.

Hero, </author> <title> "Penalized maximum likelihood image reconstruction using space alternating generalized EM algorithms," </title> <journal> IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, </journal> <volume> vol. 4, no. 10, </volume> <pages> pp. 1417-1429, </pages> <month> October </month> <year> 1995. </year>
Reference-contexts: This leads to an iterative penalized maximum likelihood (PML) reconstruction algorithm, equivalently a MAP algorithm with Gibbs prior, implemented using the space alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE-EM) version of the EM algorithm <ref> [19] </ref>. In Section V-C the PML algorithm with perfect side information is generalized to the case of noisy boundary estimates. Here the MRI-derived boundary estimator resolution may be lower than ECT spatial resolution in some regions of the image. <p> However, the ML algorithm suffers from slow convergence and is not well suited to incorporation of image smoothness or anatomical side information. Penalized ML (PML) image reconstruction can enforce image smoothness by introducing roughness penalty functions into the loglikelihood objective function <ref> [19] </ref>, [35]. <p> Attenuation was not included. The scan time for PET was adjusted to obtain 1 million detected counts not including background events. PML reconstructions of the phantom were implemented using 60 iterations of SAGE3 (Space Alternating Generalized EM <ref> [19] </ref>) with a quadratic penalty and second order Gibbs weights. The reconstructions were performed on 400 independent realizations of emission data to obtain empirical estimates of bias and variance. We first illustrate a spatially variant resolution property of the minimax averaged Gibbs weighting scheme.

Reference-contexts: This is a quadratic Gibbs penalty implemented with a blurred or smoothed weight map. The blurring is performed via space-variant convolution of the weight map with a multi-dimensional Gaussian density having local covariance equal to the inverse observed Fisher information matrix <ref> [20] </ref>. Numerical results are presented in Section VI. Representative reconstructed concentration density images are shown, which indicate significant qualitative improvements using the PML algorithm with resolution-selective Gibbs penalty. These improvements are quantitatively supported with bias-variance tradeoff curves. <p> In terms of the asymptotic theorem, the use of either of the information matrices (34) or (35) in the Gaussian approximation (33) is equivalent. However, there have been studies showing that the observed information has better finite sample approximation properties in certain situations <ref> [20] </ref>. The observed Fisher information matrix for the B-spline boundary model is derived in Appendix H. Theorem 2 allows us to obtain the following key result, proven in Appendix G. <p> The bias-variance curves using three different types of Fisher information are quite close to each other and to the ideal curve. On the other hand, as contrasted with the results reported in <ref> [20] </ref>, CSPL REPORT SERIES TR 312, AUGUST 1998 15 Fig. 12 gives clear indication that smoothing with expected Fisher information significantly outperforms smoothing with observed Fisher information smoothing as the MRI noise power spectrum density oe 2 n increases. VII. <p> From (18) and (19) the first two terms on the right hand side of the inequality can be recognized as PML (; ~ w), which finishes the proof. fl H.

Reference-contexts: Many non-parametric approaches to boundary estimation have been proposed, e.g., morphological transforms such as medial axis, skeleton, thinning algorithms, active contours, and Laplacian edge extraction operators <ref> [21] </ref>. An example of the latter approach is to perform edge detection by thresholding the gradient image followed by an algorithm which connects and smooths the detected edges to form a closed contour.

Reference-contexts: Some of the well-known models used to represent closed boundaries are periodic planar curve models such as Fourier descriptors, fitting of line segments, cubics, Bezier curves, Beta-splines and B-splines <ref> [24] </ref>. In this report we adopt the B-spline boundary model. A B-spline consists of a set of K fixed positions, called knots, and piecewise smooth curves, called basis functions, connecting each of the knot positions. For an m-th order B-spline these curves are specified by polynomial functions of degree m.

Penalized Maximum Likelihood Reconstruction The most common method for reconstructing ECT images from projections is the non-iterative filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm [32], <ref> [33] </ref> which does not account for Poisson statistics, scattering, or attenuation. An iterative maximum likelihood (ML) image reconstruction algorithm was implemented with expectation-maximization in [34] which accounts for Poisson statistics and is easily modified to account for attenuation and scattering.

Penalized Maximum Likelihood Reconstruction The most common method for reconstructing ECT images from projections is the non-iterative filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm [32], [33] which does not account for Poisson statistics, scattering, or attenuation. An iterative maximum likelihood (ML) image reconstruction algorithm was implemented with expectation-maximization in <ref> [34] </ref> which accounts for Poisson statistics and is easily modified to account for attenuation and scattering. However, the ML algorithm suffers from slow convergence and is not well suited to incorporation of image smoothness or anatomical side information.

Reference-contexts: However, the ML algorithm suffers from slow convergence and is not well suited to incorporation of image smoothness or anatomical side information. Penalized ML (PML) image reconstruction can enforce image smoothness by introducing roughness penalty functions into the loglikelihood objective function [19], <ref> [35] </ref>.
