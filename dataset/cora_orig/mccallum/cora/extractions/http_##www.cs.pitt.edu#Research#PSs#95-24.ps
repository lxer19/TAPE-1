Reference-contexts: We can assume that the minimum possible assignment is computed by an o*ine algorithm that has a priori knowledge of I. Note that the instance I specifies the metric space as well as the values of the s j 's, c j 's, and r i 's. In <ref> [1] </ref> the online assignment problem, a special case of online transportation in which each capacity c i = 1, was studied. In [1], it was shown that the competitive ratio of the greedy algorithm, which assigns the nearest available server site to the new request, has a competitive ratio of 2 <p> Note that the instance I specifies the metric space as well as the values of the s j 's, c j 's, and r i 's.

In [1], it was shown that the optimal deterministic competitive ratio is 2m 1. These results illustrate the criticisms of the adversarial nature of the definition of competitive ratio, namely: 1. The achievable competitive ratios grow quickly with input size, and would seem to overly pessimistic for "normal" inputs. 2. <p> References to other ways that have been suggested to modify the definition of competitiveness can be found in [3].

In [6] the average competitive ratio for the greedy algorithm in the online assignment problem is studied under the assumption that the metric space is the Euclidean plane and the points are uniformly distributed in a unit square.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We consider the natural online version of the well-known transportation problem <ref> [2, 4] </ref>. The initial setting consists of a collection S = fs 1 ; : : : ; s m g of server sites. Each server site s j has a positive integral capacity c j . <p> In [6] the average competitive ratio for the greedy algorithm in the online assignment problem is studied under the assumption that the metric space is the Euclidean plane and the points are uniformly distributed in a unit square. The o*ine transportation problem can be solved in polynomial-time <ref> [2, 4] </ref>. 2 2 Preliminaries In this section we introduce some definitions and concepts that are common to the remaining sections. We generally begin by assuming the simplifying condition that the online capacity c i of each server site is two.

Reference-contexts: Recall that the traditional competitive ratio of every online algorithm is (m). We now summarize related results. In [5] the weakened adversary model was used to study the paging problem.
