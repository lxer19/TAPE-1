Abstract: The task of designing an 18 parameter IIR-filter which has to meet tight specifications for both magnitude response and group delay is investigated. This problem must usually be tackeled by specialized design methods and requires an expert in digital signal processing for its solution. The usage of the general purpose minimization method Differential Evolution (DE), however, allows to perform the filter design with a minimum knowledge about digital filters.

In cases where linear or quasi linear phase is required one usually resorts to FIR filters which can provide 2 piecewise exactly linear phase, i.e. piecewise constant group delay. <p> Linearity of phase, however, is only required in the pass band of a filter which is why for some applications the usage of FIR filters means an unnecessary high realization expense. An example for this is a graphics codec for sample rate reduction <ref> [3] </ref>, the magnitude and group delay specifications of which are depicted in Fig. 1. The specifications of Fig. 1 can be fulfilled by employing a linear phase FIR filter of degree 61 [4]. <p> Conclusion It has been demonstrated that it is feasible to design an 18 parameter IIR-filter according to <ref> [3] </ref> with requirements for both magnitude response and group delay by employing the general purpose minimization method of Differential Evolution (DE). In general the above design problem is a difficult one and requires considerable expertise to be solved successfully.

Reference-contexts: An example for this is a graphics codec for sample rate reduction [3], the magnitude and group delay specifications of which are depicted in Fig. 1. The specifications of Fig. 1 can be fulfilled by employing a linear phase FIR filter of degree 61 <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> The hope is to achieve an overall reduced realization expense and a lower overall filter delay. In fact a successful design of this kind has been reported in <ref> [4] </ref> where the graphics codec had been realized by a linear phase FIR prefilter of degree 7 followed by an IIR filter of degree 14.

Reference-contexts: The IIR filter consists of an IIR lowpass of degree 6 which fulfills the magnitude requirements and an IIR allpass of degree 8 which is used to make the entire filter meet the group delay specifications. It has been shown in <ref> [5] </ref> that via specialized design methods for IIR filters which simultaneously consider magnitude and phase requirements the IIR filter degree can be reduced to 10. Specialized methods for IIR filter design in the complex domain, however, are usually not readily available and have the disadvantage of being difficult to implement. <p> Design of the Objective Function Like in <ref> [5] </ref> the graphics codec specifications from Fig. 1 shall be met by a cascade of a seventh order linear phase FIR pre-filter and an IIR filter of order 10 with an overall magnitude response A f r r r r GC p p p p p p i i i i <p> W F W F W F W F - - + - + + - - + - + 1 75 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 5 p p p p = r 2 4 Like in <ref> [5] </ref>, the FIR filter coefficients remain fixed to the values f n = -0.033271, -0.019816, 0.169865, 0.415454- (15) leaving only the radii and angles of poles and zeroes of the IIR part as well as the constant a 0 as free parameters.

Reference-contexts: Hence it is attractive to perform the filter design with a general purpose function minimizer which is powerful enough to solve truly difficult design problems and yet is simple to understand and to implement. Differential Evolution (DE) <ref> [6] </ref> has recently proven to be fast converging for a wide variety of test cases while its implementation takes less than 300 lines of C source code. In the following chapters the steps to synthesize the graphics codec by using DE are elaborated. <p> Differential Evolution for Function Minimization The objective function (21) is a highly nonlinear and partly non-differentiable function which exhibits many local minima. Therefore a powerful global minimization algorithm is required which is able to cope with these properties. Recently Differential Evolution (DE) <ref> [6] </ref> has proven to be a promising candidate for solving such problems. As an additional benefit DE is very simple to understand and to implement. DE is also particularly easy to work with as only few control variables exist which remain fixed throughout the entire optimization procedure.

IIR Filter Equations The analysis of IIR filters via the z-Transform is well treated in the signal processing literature <ref> [7] </ref> which is why only the necessary equations will be given in the following.
