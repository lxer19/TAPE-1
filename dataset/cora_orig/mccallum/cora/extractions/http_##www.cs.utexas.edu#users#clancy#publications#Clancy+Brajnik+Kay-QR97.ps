Abstract: Model Revision: Techniques and tools for analyzing simulation results Abstract One of the factors hindering the wide-spread application of qualitative simulation techniques is the difficulty encountered when developing a qualitative model. Analyzing the resulting behavioral description and revising the model in response to this analysis requires a significant amount of expertise and is often left up to the modeler. As a result, developing a qualitative model is difficult for users who are not familiar with the field. Furthermore, this process is often not addressed within the literature making it difficult for such a user to obtain the necessary expertise except through trial and error. This paper addresses the process of model revision and presents a set of tools and methods to assist in the performance of this task. It also demonstrates how qualitative simulation can be used to obtain a more detailed understanding of the dynamical properties of the modeled system. The tools presented help the modeler extract information from a complex behavioral description by providing alternative views of the description, allowing the modeler to perform a focused search of the potential state space and providing explanation facilities for the branches occuring within the description. These tools and the methods are discussed with respect to the development of a semi-quantitative model of a controller for a tank. and revising qualitative models

Propositional formul specifying qualitative and quan-titative state information are combined using temporal operators such as until and next to form path formul that specify trajectory information.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, energy constraints should be included in models that have this property or a derivable Lyapunov function. While energy con straints will increase the number of variables in a model, their constraining power is usually worth the cost. See <ref> (Fouche and Kuipers 1992) </ref> for a detailed discussion. 2. Corresponding values | Corresponding values help to pin down the curve defined by a constraint by introducing qualitative points through which it must pass.

Reference-contexts: Kay (1992) applies state simplification to a model of the Space Shuttle Reaction Control System. 3. Order-of-magnitude reasoning introduces additional information into the model that can disambiguate the relative scale of differing influences within a model. Within the QSIM framework, the W+ constraint can be used for this purpose <ref> (Kay 1992) </ref>). 4. Operating region partitioning splits the behavior of a single model into pieces, each of which is a simpler model. Since each model is simpler, it produces fewer behaviors. The cost, however, is that rules for translating between models must be described.

Reference-contexts: Quantitative information | In some cases, the qualitative behavior of a model may be inherently ambiguous. In cases where simplification is an unacceptable alternative, quantitative information may be available that can reduce ambiguity <ref> (Kay 1996) </ref>. Event analysis is often helpful in focusing the search for what information has been omitted by analyzing unexpected branches.

Reference-contexts: The tools presented are used to filter the information provided by the simulation, selectively explore regions of the state space, and explain why certain phenomena did or did not occur. The ideas presented here have been explored using the QSIM qualitative simulation algorithm <ref> (Kuipers 1994) </ref> although many of them can be generalized to other qualitative simulation algorithms. All tools have been implemented and will be available in the upcom-ing revision of QSIM soon to be released. <p> Redundant constraints | In some models, it is possible to state a constraint in more than one way. While this is clearly redundant analytically, it is possible that ambiguity in one formulation may not be present in the other. Kuipers <ref> (Kuipers 1994) </ref> provides an example of redundant constraints in mod eling a hot/cold mixing tank. 4. Quantitative information | In some cases, the qualitative behavior of a model may be inherently ambiguous. <p> State simplification reduces the number of state variables within a model. Since the size of the state space affects the complexity of a model, fewer state variables can simplify the behavior tree. One example of state simplification is the use of time-scale abstraction <ref> (Kuipers 1994) </ref> where state variables can be eliminated by viewing their processes as instantaneous with respect to other model processes. Another example is the combination of multiple, related, state variables into a single state. Kay (1992) applies state simplification to a model of the Space Shuttle Reaction Control System. 3.

Reference-contexts: Variable focus has been available as part of the QSIM distribution for a couple of years although it has recently been extended to include some of the functionality described above. It is similar in concept to a technique recently developed by Mallory <ref> (Mallory, Porter, and Kuipers 1996) </ref> to abstract envisionment graphs. Variable focus, however, is designed to work with a behavior tree and thus must handle the introduction of landmarks.

Reference-contexts: used to automate the process of iterative refinement using algebraic simplification and identify redundant constraints that may further constrain the model, * developing more sophisticated explanation techniques that can provide a comprehensive description of the classes of behaviors described within the be havioral description, and * incorporating theory refinement techniques <ref> (Richards, Kraan and Kuipers 1992) </ref> to induce potential revisions to the model using the current model and a description of the expected, desired, or observed behaviors of the system.

Reference-contexts: As a result, it is difficult for users not familiar with the field of qualitative reasoning to quickly come up to speed and develop a model. Furthermore, this process is often not addressed within the literature <ref> (Weld and de Kleer 1990) </ref> making it difficult for such a user to obtain the necessary expertise except through trial and error. In this paper we address both the process of revising a model and present a set of tools to assist a modeler in this process.
