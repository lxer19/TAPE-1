Reference-contexts: The byte rates shown include an adjustment for frame-format overhead. 7 Transmission protocol: The transmission protocol includes the definition of the trans-mission code and related functions. The transmission code is an 8-10 code <ref> [1] </ref> which provides sufficient transition density and DC balance to meet the requirements of an optical receiver. It also provides a large number of control codes in the 10-bit domain which are in addition to the 256 code points of the data alphabet.

Reference-contexts: Considerable flexibility exists in the design of Fibre Channel switches, such as the switch architecture (crossbar, multistage), classes of service supported, and other options provided. Techniques such as camp-on and stacked connection requests may be used to improve the throughput of the switch <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. In the future, Fibre Channel switches will incorporate mechanisms for providing quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees for real-time data. For I/O systems in which a switch-based fabric is too expensive, a low-cost interconnect, Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL), is defined, based on a loop topology.

Reference-contexts: (FC-FP): This standard defines the rules for mapping the HIPPI framing protocol onto FC-PH, thus allowing Fibre Channel to be substituted for the HIPPI physical layer and HIPPI switch. * Mapping of Single-Byte Command Code Sets (FC-SB): This standard defines the rules for mapping the IBM ESCON 1 I/O Interface <ref> [4] </ref> protocol onto FC-PH. <p> Its purpose is to address the need, felt by both vendors and customers of the IBM ESCON I/O Interface, to have an open standard based on the ESCON definition <ref> [4] </ref> and compatible with existing ESCON products. SBCON specifies fiber-optic interconnections of system channels and I/O subsystems (called control 35 units) using a non-blocking switch which provides circuit-switched connections similar to Fi--bre Channel class 1. The link signalling rate is 200 Mbaud.

Reference-contexts: The HPSS is a distributed switching system designed to operate with the Fibre Channel protocols. The largest configuration of the switch has 4096 full-duplex ports. The system is constructed from interconnected crossbars, based on a folded version of the Clos three-stage network <ref> [5] </ref>. The system uses distributed control, unlike most of the previous designs based on Clos networks. Each fabric port supports a signalling rate of 1.0625 Gbits/s, corresponding to the highest speed currently supported by Fibre Channel.

Reference-contexts: With the chosen set of parameters, the points in Figure 7 correspond to the saturation throughput for each value of switch latency on the x-axis. For more detailed results on the performance of HPSS, the reader is referred to <ref> [6] </ref>. Relationship of Fibre Channel to Other Standards A naive view of standards would suggest that there should be only one standard to perform any given function. Yet communications-related standards sometimes appear to be proliferating faster than the previous generations of proprietary architectures.

Reference-contexts: In addition, an ATM switch for use in high-performance system clustering must have a very low cell-loss rate, comparable to the frame loss rate due to the bit-error rate on the interconnecting links. Otherwise, excessive bandwidth will be consumed in error recovery. Fast Ethernet, also known as 100BaseT <ref> [9] </ref>, is an extension of the IEEE 802.3 MAC protocol to support a link data rate of 100 Mbits/s. The architecture of 100BaseT is almost identical to its 10-Mbit/s counterpart 10BaseT.
Reference: [10] <institution> Article in this issue of IEEE Communications. </institution>
Reference-contexts: Since 100BaseT has the same frame-size specifications as 10BaseT, this results in a reduction in the maximum allowable network diameter by a factor of 10, limiting the maximum distance between two stations to approximately 210 meters. 26 100VG-AnyLAN <ref> [10] </ref> is a 100-Mbit/s LAN protocol developed by the IEEE 802.12 working group. Its architecture and MAC protocol are different from those of other IEEE 802-series LAN standards. However, 100VG-AnyLAN supports the frame formats defined by both 802.3 and 802.5, thereby providing for compatibility with existing 802.3 and 802.5 software.

Reference-contexts: The frame is removed from the ring by its destination, thus allowing multiple concurrent transmissions on the ring ("spatial reuse"), providing potential throughput improvements over conventional token-based protocols, though the degree of throughput improvement depends on the configuration and workload. A token-based protocol called the SAT (for SATisfaction) algorithm <ref> [13] </ref> provides fair access to the ring. Frame transmission is regulated by a token, called the SAT token, which circulates around the ring in the direction opposite to the direction of data flow.
