Title: Dense Probabilistic Encryption  
Author: Josh Benaloh 
Affiliation: Clarkson University  
Abstract: This paper describes a method of dense probabilistic encryption. Previous probabilistic encryption methods require large numbers of random bits and produce large amounts of ciphertext for the encryption of each bit of plaintext. This paper develops a method of probabilistic encryption in which the ratio of ciphertext text size to plaintext size and the proportion of random bits to plaintext can both be made arbitrarily close to one. The methods described here have applications which are not in any apparent way possible with previous methods. These applications include simple and efficient protocols for noninteractive verifiable secret sharing and a method for conducting practical and verifiable secret-ballot elections.

Reference-contexts: However, their method is exponential in the number of shareholders. The application of the encryption method described in this paper to the problem of verifiable secret sharing was first given in <ref> [Bena86] </ref> in which interactive proof techniques are also required. Feldman ([Feld87]), Ben-Or, Goldwasser, and Wigderson ([BGW88]), Rabin ([Rabi88]), and Rabin and Ben-Or ([RaBO89]) later expanded upon this approach.

Reference-contexts: (Note that segmenting share values bit by bit does not work since the Shamir scheme can only be applied when the number of shareholders is smaller than the secret/share space | which in this case is 2.) 3.2 Verifiable Secret-Ballot Elections The problem of verifiable secret-ballot elections is defined in <ref> [Bena87] </ref>, and a solution is presented there which depends strongly on the dense probabilistic encryption described here. The general problem is quite complex and its solution requires many techniques which are not addressed here. <p> The oversimplified scheme presented here has many omissions and should not be read as a claim of a secure method of holding verifiable secret-ballot elections. The reader is referred to <ref> [Bena87] </ref> for a complete treatment. The scheme described in this section is centralized. A central government is assumed to exist. The government prepares a dense probabilistic encryption function E r as described herein with r greater than the number of eligible voters and publicly reveals E r . <p> There are, of course, many problems with this scheme. But this is the fundamental idea used in [CoFi85], [BeYu86], [Cohe86], <ref> [Bena87] </ref>, and [BeTu94] to enable a variety of practical verifiable election schemes. 4 Conclusions This paper has described a method of dense probabilistic encryption which has many similarities to, but many advantages over, the original method of probabilistic encryption introduced by Goldwasser and Micali.
