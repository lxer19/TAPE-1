Abstract: The poor acceptance of ES technology by users has been attributed to the lack of attention to computer and user cooperation issues in knowledge based systems (KBS). While the traditional question-conclusion style of interaction may be appropriate in many circumstances, it is not necessarily the best or the only mode that users may require. Teaching, causal explanation/modeling, critiquing, what-if analysis and even knowledge acquisition are some of the possible modes of interaction. If we are able to adapt knowledge already captured to a wide range of modes we can add value to the knowledge resource. Ripple down rules have addressed two of the major limitations of first generation ES, the maintenance and knowledge acquisition (KA) bottleneck problems. This is achieved through acquiring knowledge directly from an expert, the use of an exception structure for knowledge representation and the storing of the cornerstone case associated with each rule. Just as RDR has offered a paradigm shift in the way these problems were solved, it may be possible that RDR can offer a new approach to the issue of reuse of knowledge. This paper reviews the extent to which knowledge captured in an RDR KBS for one purpose can be readily reused to fit a different decision situation.

Reference-contexts: Interestingly, it was found that ETS and a descendant system KAQ were limited to classification problems and that extraction of causal, procedural or strategic knowledge was difficult <ref> (Boose et al 1989) </ref>. These issues are similar to those faced by RDR which are currently being investigated. 3.

This study has chosen to use a knowledge acquisition and representation technique which captures knowledge in context without the need for complex modeling, known as ripple down rules (RDR). 2.

Reference-contexts: ES need to offer explanations because of imprecise domains and the use of heuristics. Explanations that rely on the use of subgoaling to reach conclusions often do not provide explanations that match the way in which the expert and/or user reach the same conclusion <ref> ( Clancey 1984) </ref>. He found that for explanation or learning purposes ES need to articulate how rules fit together, how they are constructed ( Clancey 1984, p.59). <p> He found that for explanation or learning purposes ES need to articulate how rules fit together, how they are constructed <ref> ( Clancey 1984, p.59) </ref>. This is supported by the structure of an RDR KBS, see figure 4, but is difficult to determine in conventional ES because of complex interaction of rules and the numerous possible pathways to arrive at a conclusion.

Reference-contexts: There is no attempt to create general rules. The new rule is added to the true or false branch of the incorrect rule.

The system used for knowledge acquisition is also used for inferencing and the exception structure ensures that all previous classifications remain correct. This is one of the strengths of RDR since at KA time the knowledge is also validated.

Reference-contexts: The only construction problem tackled to-date using RDR concerned configuring for ion chromatography. This was achieved by changing the structure of the problem, each final output had its own tree developed by ML, so that it became a classification problem using RDR in a recursive manner <ref> (Mulholland et al 1993) </ref>. This solution was not completely satisfactory and research, described briefly later in this paper, is looking at adapting the MCRDR algorithm to properly cater for construction problems.

Given the knowledge acquisition ( KA) bottleneck problem it is undesirable to build KBS for each purpose.
