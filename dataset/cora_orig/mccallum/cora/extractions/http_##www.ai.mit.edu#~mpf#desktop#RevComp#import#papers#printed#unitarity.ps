Abstract: Unitarity of the global evolution is an extremely stringent condition on finite state models in discrete spacetime. Quantum cellular automata, in particular, are tightly constrained. In previous work we proved a simple No-go Theorem which precludes nontrivial homogeneous evolution for linear quantum cellular automata. Here we carefully define general quantum cellular automata in order to investigate the possibility that there be nontrivial homogeneous unitary evolution when the local rule is nonlinear. Since the unitary global transition amplitudes are constructed from the product of local transition amplitudes, infinite lattices require different treatment than periodic ones. We prove Unitarity Theorems for both cases, expressing the equivalence in 1+1 dimensions of global unitarity and certain sets of constraints on the local rule, and then show that these constraints can be solved to give a variety of multiparameter families of nonlinear quantum cellular automata. The Unitarity Theorems, together with a Surjectivity Theorem for the infinite case, also imply that unitarity is decidable for one dimensional cellular automata.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Already present in Feynman's inspirational essay on quantum physics and computation <ref> [1] </ref> is the concept of a binary quantum cellular automaton (QCA): a discrete spacetime array of quantum processors, each of which has two eigenstates (un/occupied or spin up/down) and is coupled to some set of neighboring processors.

Durr and Santha have obtained the same result by different methods <ref> [19] </ref>. Our main interest in this section, however, is to extract from these theorems a procedure for finding multiparameter families of local rules which define QCAs. We do so, and apply it in the cases where the local neighborhood has size 2 or 3.

Reference-contexts: need to find the cycles in G 1 , of course, but it will become useful in more complicated situations. * These are sometimes called `one-way' automata [15] since the local neighborhood of x extends only to one side, although Hillman has pointed out that this terminology is somewhat misleading <ref> [34] </ref>. 18 Unitarity in nonlinear QCAs David A.

Reference-contexts: That the only deterministic binary CAs with neighborhoods of size 2 or 3 are trivial in this sense is well known <ref> [35] </ref> (this is also the sense in which the only linear QCAs which are allowed by the No-Go Theorem are trivial for any size neighborhood [8]); we have just shown that if D f contains more than just 00 (or 11) then infinite k = 2 QCAs are trivial in the

Reference-contexts: That the converse of Theorem 5.1 is false is demonstrated by the existence of the nontrivial k = 4 reversible deterministic CA found by Patt <ref> [36] </ref>, with local rule: f (iji 1 i 2 i 3 i 4 ) = 1 ffi ii 2 if i 1 = i 4 = 0, i 3 = 1; ffi ii 2 otherwise.

Reference-contexts: Whether any are computationally universal remains to be discovered. There is a long standing conjecture that computational power will be maximal at critical points of a physical theory <ref> [37] </ref>. Since the rule spaces here are smoothly parameterized this is a more natural arena in which to investigate this conjecture than is the deterministic case. Consideration of QCAs as physical models, possibly with critical points, raises the question of the continuum limits of these models.

Reference-contexts: From the perspective of fundamental physics, it would be most interesting to determine the continuum limits of the simple nonlinear models we have found here and to extend them to higher dimensions. That the reversible deterministic billiard ball model is computational universal <ref> [38] </ref> suggests that higher dimensional QCAs might also be easier to prove computationally powerful.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted, however, that there can be no analogue of the Unitarity Theorems in higher dimensions since reversibility of deterministic CAs is undecidable in two dimensions <ref> [39] </ref>; the best we can expect is, as in Theorem 5.1, to find particular sets of local rules which ensure unitarity. Despite the existence of computation universal deterministic CAs, probably their most important applications are simulations of physical systems [40].
