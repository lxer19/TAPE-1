Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction System stability with respect to input perturbations is one of the central issues to be studied in control. During the past few years, the property called "input to state stability" (iss) has been proposed (originally in <ref> (Sontag, 1989a) </ref>) as a foundation for the study of such problems, and has been subsequently employed by many authors in areas ranging from robust control to highly nonlinear small-gain theorems (see for instance (Jiang et al., 1994; Tsinias, 1989)). <p> Observe that is a nondecreasing function. Using exactly the same arguments as used on page 441 of <ref> (Sontag, 1989a) </ref>, one can show that there exist some KL-function fi and some nondecreasing function fl such that jx (t; ~; u)j fi (j~j ; t) + fl (juj) for each input u and each initial state ~. It is easy to see from this that the system is compact-iss. <p> By the proof of Theorem 1 in <ref> (Sontag, 1989a) </ref>, (strictly speaking, this is not a particular case of the setup in the first part, because the closed-loop system need not satisfy a Lipschitz property at the origin), one knows that there ex ists a KL-function fi so that for every trajectory x (t; ~; w) of the closed-loop <p> When studying the problem of iss stabilizability for a system of the form (13), a special case is that of "matching uncertainties" when G = D; then the equations have the form _x = f (x) + G (x)(u + w): (23) In <ref> (Sontag, 1989a) </ref>, it was shown that if system (23) is stabilizable by a smooth feedback when w = 0 in (23), then the system is also iss--stabilizable by a smooth feedback.

Reference-contexts: In the paper <ref> (Sontag and Wang, 1995) </ref>, the authors established the equivalence among several natural characterizations of the iss property, stated in terms of dissipation inequalities, robustness margins, and Lyapunov-like functions. The iss property was originally stated for stability with respect to a given equilibrium state of interest. <p> Given the interest in set-iss, it is an obvious question to ask whether the equivalent characterizations given in <ref> (Sontag and Wang, 1995) </ref> for the special case A = equilibrium extend to the more general set case. <p> It is the main purpose of this paper to point out that, at fl Supported in part by US Air Force Grant F49620-95-1-0101 flfl Supported in part by NSF Grants DMS-9457826 and DMS-9403924 least for the case of compact invariant sets A, the results in <ref> (Sontag and Wang, 1995) </ref> indeed can be generalized with little or no change; in particular, iss with respect to a given A is equivalent to the existence of an "iss-Lyapunov function" relative to A. (Most of the proofs valid in the equilibrium case extend easily to the set case.) The property <p> Together with (2), this gives the desired property with ffi := min f1; ffi 1 ; ffi 2 g. 2 In a manner entirely analogous to the equilibrium case in <ref> (Sontag and Wang, 1995) </ref>, Lemma 2.7, one can show the following characterization in terms of decay estimates: Lemma 2.6 The system is iss with respect to the compact set A if and only if there are a KL-function fi and a K-function fl so that jx (t; ~; u)j A fi <p> Extending the proof of Remark 2.4 in <ref> (Sontag and Wang, 1995) </ref>, it can be shown that all variants of the definition are equivalent. 2 Remark 2.9 If A is not compact, then properties (6) and (7) may no longer be equivalent. <p> Then the system is iss with respect to A iff it admits an iss-Lyapunov function with respect to A. The proof follows essentially the same lines as the proof of the analogous Theorem 1 (for equilibria) in <ref> (Sontag and Wang, 1995) </ref>. We omit the details for reasons of space, but the main point is that care must be taken to establish all estimates in terms of jj A rather than Euclidean norm. <p> As when studying (non-iss) stabilizability under feedback, we search for conditions expressed in terms of "control Lyapunov functions." Observe that if there exists a feedback law as above, then, by the main result in <ref> (Sontag and Wang, 1995) </ref>, there exists a positive definite, proper function ' such that the system _x = f (x) + G (x)k (x) + '(x)D (x)d (15) is uniformly globally asymptotically stable (ugas) with respect to all d 2 M O (= the set of all measurable functions from IR
