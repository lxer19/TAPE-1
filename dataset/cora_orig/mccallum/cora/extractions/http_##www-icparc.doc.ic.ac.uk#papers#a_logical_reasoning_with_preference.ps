Title: A logical reasoning with preference

Abstract: In a decision making context, multiple choices of actions are usually offered to solve a particular problem. Consequently, the question of preferences among the actions will occur. The ordering of recommended actions by preference is made by taking into account the states of the universe of discourse. We develop here a logic L p for reasoning about preferences in such circumstances. The language of the logic is propositional extended with a special binary relation of preference among formulae. The model theory of the logic is studied and the soundness and completeness theorem is established. Keywords: preference, decision support system, action, logic.

Reference-contexts: Note that each R x is a property and the presence of only x implies that action x has been taken. Ideally R should be replaced by a model operator <ref> [2] </ref>. We now construct a possible transition from this state using the concept of minimal model. A minimal of a state provides us exactly those information which are true in that state. <p> This is what one expects from S. In the propositional case, we did not achieve this preference due to the absence of the preferential sentence in S. 9 4 Discussion The notion of preference among actions was an important aspect of the logic L safe <ref> [2] </ref> for reasoning about safety in decision support systems. Here we have studied the concept of preference in detail and developed a logic of preference L p . <p> We need to add a set of axioms related to time, action and properties <ref> [2] </ref>. In addition to these, the axiom 8t 1 8t 2 ([t 1 ; t 2 ]-(F; G) $ -([t 1 ; t 2 ]F; [t 1 ; t 2 ]G)) should also be added to formalise the behavior of preference in time intervals.

Reference-contexts: In particular, in oncology there are preferences which if contravened may rise hazardous situation, for example, there is a preference to administer the drug taxol before cisplatin than after in the treatment of cancer <ref> [3] </ref>. Therefore, a formal study of preference is recognised as an important goal yet to be attempted. To achieve this we construct a formal logic of preference in this paper. There are several types of preferences that are relative to state or circumstances.

Reference-contexts: 1 L p informally The study of concepts in which moral philosophers take an interest is categorized by von Wright <ref> [4] </ref> into three groups: deontological, value-concepts and anthropological. The notion of preference or betterness belongs to the group of value-concepts and holds a prominent place in decision making context. There are several application domains where preference need to be represented, for example, medicine and economics. <p> We can represent somebody's preference directly into the knowledge base without any conditions attached to it. Although this kind of preference will be rare in the context of a decision support system where construction behind preferences involved justifications. The fifth axiom in <ref> [4] </ref> is -(F; G) $ -(F ^ H; G ^ H) ^ -(F ^ :H; G ^ :H) which corresponds to the above unconditional preference and therefore has not been considered in our theory of preference. Also, axioms of (8) are a simplified version of their counterpart.
