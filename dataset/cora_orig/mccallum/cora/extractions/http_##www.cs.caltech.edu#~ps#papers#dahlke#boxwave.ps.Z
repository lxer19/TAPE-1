Abstract: Some specific box splines are refinable functions with respect to nfin expanding integer scaling matrices M satisfying M n = 2I: Therefore they can be used to define a multiresolution analysis and a wavelet basis associated with these scaling matrices. In this paper, we construct biorthogonal wavelet bases for this special subclass of box splines. These specific bases can also be used to derive wavelets with respect to classical dyadic scaling matrices.

Reference-contexts: Special emphasis was put on the construction of wavelets by using spline functions, since spline functions are well-understood, allow for explicit computations, and possess additional structure. First examples of one-dimensional B-spline wavelets were constructed by Lemarie [16] and Battle <ref> [1] </ref> and later investigated in detail by Chui and Wang [5], [6], see also Micchelli [18]. In higher dimensions, a first approach using box splines was given by Riemenschneider and Shen, see also [4]. In [19], they constructed an orthonormal box spline wavelet basis.

Reference-contexts: If m is large, this problem can be highly nontrivial, see e.g. <ref> [15] </ref> for details. On the other hand, for scaling matrices satisfying j det M j = 2, the extension problem becomes quite simple. Furthermore, the case j det M j = 2 is important, because only one wavelet is needed to generate a wavelet basis. <p> A classical construction of these wavelets would require the extension of a 2 n -dimensional vector as described above. If the set of direction vectors is judiciously chosen, then the Theorem of Quillen and Suslin ensures that such an extension exists, see e.g. <ref> [15] </ref> for details. Nevertheless, its explicit determination can be very complicated. It turns out that the construction presented here provides a way to circumvent this difficulty.

Reference-contexts: However, the resulting wavelet basis is not compactly supported since the integer translates of a box spline are in general not orthonormal. This problem can be avoided by considering pre-wavelets. For box splines, this concept was also developed by Riemenschneider and Shen <ref> [20] </ref>. But again, when dealing with pre-wavelets, at least one of the associated filters will be infinite, so that the usefulness of pre-wavelets is limited.
