Reference-contexts: Several tools have been developed to make use of the MBONE as a means of distributing both voice and video image, via software. Examples tools are Visual Audio Tool (VAT) [6] which allows sound to be transmitted over the Internet, Network Video (NV) <ref> [3] </ref> which allows video images to be transmitted over the Internet, the Session Directory (SD) [5] which allows the advertising of multicast sessions and the Whiteboard (WB) which allows interactive drawing across the Internet, to name just a few.

Reference-contexts: These are the groups that set the recommendations that govern what the networks can offer. In most cases they are the representatives of governments or carrier organisations and their role is to ensure that the technicalities of the global network are compatible and professional. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) <ref> [4] </ref>, under the auspices of the United Nation, has created the ITU-T to look after the standardization sector of telecommunications. This was formally the role of the International Consultative Telegraph and Telephone Committee (CCITT).

Each tool looks after one particular medium, so that one medium does not impose restrictions upon another.

Reference-contexts: Steve Casner established the workings of the service we now call the MBONE in 1992. Several tools have been developed to make use of the MBONE as a means of distributing both voice and video image, via software. Examples tools are Visual Audio Tool (VAT) <ref> [6] </ref> which allows sound to be transmitted over the Internet, Network Video (NV) [3] which allows video images to be transmitted over the Internet, the Session Directory (SD) [5] which allows the advertising of multicast sessions and the Whiteboard (WB) which allows interactive drawing across the Internet, to name just a

Reference-contexts: This is why the Dutch ATM backbone, under development in the SURFnet4 high-bandwidth infrastructure project, will be owned and operated by PTT Telecom. Incidentally, the same carrier company has a 49% interest in the (non-profit) Dutch academic network operator SURFNET bv, which carries out the project <ref> [7] </ref>. So it seems, in The Netherlands at least, that carrier companies are going to play a critical role in deciding the future of telecommunications functionality.

Reference-contexts: Commercial service providers now operate major backbone services for the Internet on a commercial basis <ref> [8] </ref>. These commercial network providers thus take charge over essential pieces of Internet infrastructure, taking decisions which could have a serious impact on distributed multimedia services provided by the Internet such as the WorldWide Web and MBONE, which well discuss further on.

Reference-contexts: Each tool looks after one particular medium, so that one medium does not impose restrictions upon another. Although the IETF is quite aware of the problem of, for instance, multimedia synchronisation <ref> [10] </ref>, its main focus is the impact of the media on the carrier network. For the moment, basic problems such as data loss and timeliness of data arrival continue to affect audiovisual communication over the Internet.
