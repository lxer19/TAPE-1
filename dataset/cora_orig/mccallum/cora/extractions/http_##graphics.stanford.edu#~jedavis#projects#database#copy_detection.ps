Title: Copy Detection Mechanisms for Digital Documents  
Author: Sergey Brin, James Davis, Hector Garcia-Molina

Abstract: In a digital library system, documents are available in digital form and therefore are more easily copied and their copyrights are more easily violated. This is a very serious problem, as it discourages owners of valuable information from sharing it with authorized users. There are two main philosophies for addressing this problem: prevention and detection. The former actually makes unauthorized use of documents difficult or impossible while the latter makes it easier to discover such activity. In this paper we propose a system for registering documents and then detecting copies, either complete copies or partial copies. We describe algorithms for such detection, and metrics required for evaluating detection mechanisms (covering accuracy, efficiency, and security). We also describe a working prototype, called COPS, describe implementation issues, and present experimental results that suggest the proper settings for copy detection parameters.

Reference-contexts: For example, slightly varied pixels in an image would be lost if it is passed through a lossy JPEG encoder. A second approach, and one that we advocate in this paper (for text documents), is that of a copy detection server <ref> [1, 11] </ref>. The basic idea is as follows: When an author creates a new work, he or she registers it at the server. The server could also be the repository for a copyright recordation and registration system, as suggested in [8].

Reference-contexts: One possible direction is "watermark" schemes where a publisher incorporates a unique subtle signature (identifying the user) in a document when it is given to the user so that when an unauthorized copy is found, the source will be known <ref> [13, 3, 4, 2] </ref>. One problem is that these schemes can easily be defeated by users who destroy the watermarks. For example, slightly varied pixels in an image would be lost if it is passed through a lossy JPEG encoder.

Reference-contexts: Some schemes along these lines have been suggested, such as secure printers with cryptographically secure communications paths [12] and active documents <ref> [6] </ref> where users may interact with documents only through a special program. The problems with all such techniques is that they are cumbersome (requiring special software or hardware), restrictive (limiting access means to the document), and not completely secure (from someone with an OCR program for example).

The server could also be the repository for a copyright recordation and registration system, as suggested in <ref> [8] </ref>. As documents are registered, they are broken into small units, for now say sentences. Each sentence is hashed and a pointer to it is stored in a large hash table.

Reference-contexts: This makes it hard to rapidly distribute copies of documents. This basic scheme has much in common with sif, a tool for finding similar files in a file system, created by Udi Manber <ref> [10] </ref>. However, there are a number of differences in finding similar files versus finding similar sections of text which COPS addresses. First, since we are dealing with text, we operate on a syntactic level and hash syntactic units as opposed to fixed length strings. <p> Again, the cost is a loss of accuracy. A third option is to combine the two of these techniques without sacrificing accuracy (any more than either one alone) by sampling based on the hash numbers of the chunks <ref> [10] </ref>.

There are also applications that do not involve detection of undesirable behavior.
