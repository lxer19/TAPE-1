Abstract: In this paper we present a new approach to finding good lattice points. We employ the spectral test, a well-known figure of merit for uniform random number generators. This concept leads to an assessment of lattice points g that is closely related to the classical Babenko-Zaremba quantity ae(g; N ). The associated lattice rules are good uniformly over a whole range of dimensions. Our numerical examples suggest that this simple approach leads to quasi-Monte Carlo node sets that perform very well in comparison to the best available (t; m; s)-nets.

It would have been much more costly to search for the best LCGs in terms of the figure of merit P 2 than in terms of the spectral test index.
