Abstract: Implementation of the fine-grain EM ID and EM isolation algorithms within the constraints of the conceptual design proposed for the CMS level-1 calorimeter trigger is discussed. Some minor modifications to the algorithms are needed for this implentation and are checked with fast simulation program to cause no degradation in performance. The modifications suggested, not only simplify some of the neighbor data sharing in the system, but also provide primitives for tau trigger implementation. However, changes to the hardware are significant and warrant a closer study. This note only indicates variations on the the conceptual design that might be possible with various hardware changes. The aim of this document is to obtain an approval on the specifications outlined here so that an engineering investigation can be made.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The CMS <ref> [1] </ref> level-1 calorimeter trigger system comprises primitive generation in front-end electronics located on the detector, transmission of those primitives, and processing of that information in the regional and global trigger system located in the electronics room. A conceptual design of this system is described in detail in elsewhere [2]. <p> This trigger system performance has been simulated extensively with a fast parameterized simulation study [4, 5, 6, 7] and was determined to be adequate to satisfy the rate constraints of the data acquisition system while providing high efficiency for the physics processes studied in the CMS Technical Proposal <ref> [1] </ref>. The fast parameterized detector simulation studies allowed selection amongst some of the technical choices left as options in the early conceptual design. Early simulation results from CMSIM based programs [8] have confirmed the conclusions of the fast simulation programs.

Reference-contexts: A conceptual design of this system is described in detail in elsewhere <ref> [2] </ref>. This baseline conceptual design implemented the electron/photon, jet, missing transverse energy and total transverse energy trigger algorithms described in the specifications document [3]. <p> Early simulation results from CMSIM based programs [8] have confirmed the conclusions of the fast simulation programs. Furthermore, some minor modifications in the algorithms which either improve the efficiency or reduce the background rate were identified. These modifications require minor changes to the baseline conceptual design <ref> [2] </ref>. The use of fine-grain PbWO 4 crystal electro-magnetic calorimetry provided the possibility of analysis of electron showers within the trigger tower and provide an EM cluster identification bit [9]. <p> The aim of this document is to provide a specification for approval of the collaboration before such an engineering study is made. 2 Overview of conceptual design An overview of conceptual design is provided here for completeness, but a detailed reading of <ref> [2] </ref> may be necessary to follow some of the changes proposed in this note. The CMS barrel and endcap calorimeter trigger system is implemented in 18 crates, illustrated in Figure 1, each handling 256 trigger towers.

Reference-contexts: A conceptual design of this system is described in detail in elsewhere [2]. This baseline conceptual design implemented the electron/photon, jet, missing transverse energy and total transverse energy trigger algorithms described in the specifications document <ref> [3] </ref>. The baseline electron/photon trigger algorithm was based on the sliding window technique, which includes addition of leakage energy to sharpen the efficiency turn-on curve, and cuts on hit tower H/E and neighbor tower hadron sum to reject hadronic contamination.

Reference-contexts: The baseline jet and missing transverse energy algorithms were based on 4x4 trigger tower region transverse energy sums. This trigger system performance has been simulated extensively with a fast parameterized simulation study <ref> [4, 5, 6, 7] </ref> and was determined to be adequate to satisfy the rate constraints of the data acquisition system while providing high efficiency for the physics processes studied in the CMS Technical Proposal [1].

There are several reasons for such degradation, encompassing the effects such as those due to the cutoffs imposed at calorimeter trigger tower level, the limited resolution of trigger energy sums and the exclusion of preshower and tail catcher energies at the trigger level.

For the same E t cutoffs as those considered for the physics processes study performed with the baseline algorithms <ref> [7] </ref>, we find that the total rate continues to be under 15 kHz using the modified algorithm. The rates and E t cutoffs are summarized in the Table 4.

GEANT based CMSIM simulations <ref> [8] </ref> indicate that this two-step algorithm does not compromise the performance of fine-grain electron identification. 4.2 EM isolation algorithm The specification for the Electron Isolation ASIC in the baseline design required only the border trigger tower hadronic isolation.
