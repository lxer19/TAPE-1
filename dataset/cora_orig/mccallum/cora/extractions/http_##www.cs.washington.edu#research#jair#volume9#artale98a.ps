Abstract: A class of interval-based temporal languages for uniformly representing and reasoning about actions and plans is presented. Actions are represented by describing what is true while the action itself is occurring, and plans are constructed by temporally relating actions and world states. The temporal languages are members of the family of Description Logics, which are characterized by high expressivity combined with good computational properties. The subsumption problem for a class of temporal Description Logics is investigated and sound and complete decision procedures are given. The basic language TL-F is considered first: it is the composition of a temporal logic TL able to express interval temporal networks together with the non-temporal logic F a Feature Description Logic. It is proven that subsumption in this language is an NP-complete problem. Then it is shown how to reason with the more expressive languages TLU-FU and TL-ALCF. The former adds disjunction both at the temporal and non-temporal sides of the language, the latter extends the non-temporal side with set-valued features (i.e., roles) and a propositionally complete language.

Reference-contexts: Concepts (resp. individuals) can be specified to hold at a certain temporal variable (resp. interval). In this way, action types (resp. individual actions) can be represented in a uniform way by temporally related concepts (resp. individuals). For the basic temporal interval relations the Allen notation <ref> (Allen, 1991) </ref> (Figure 3) is used: before (b), meets (m), during (d), overlaps (o), starts (s), finishes (f), equal (=), after (a), met-by (mi), contains (di), overlapped-by (oi), started-by (si), finished-by (fi). <p> The following introduces examples of action and plan representations from two well known domains, the cooking domain (Kautz, 476 A Temporal Description Logic for Reasoning about Actions and Plans - oeoe oe -oe -oe Make-Spaghetti Boil-Spaghetti Boil Make-Marinara PutTogether-SM x y 1991; Weida & Litman, 1992) and the block world <ref> (Allen, 1991) </ref>, with the aim of showing the applicability of our framework. 5.1 The Cooking Domain Let us introduce the plan Boil-Spaghetti: Boil-Spaghetti : = 3x (x b ]).

Reference-contexts: An even more restricted form interests us here, where the concept C in rC does not contain any other temporal operator (called simple homogeneous concept). The expressiveness of the resulting logic is enough, for example, to correctly represent the homogeneous nature of states. In <ref> (Artale, Bettini, & Franconi, 1994) </ref> an algorithm to compute subsumption in TL-F augmented with the homogeneity operator is proposed. Even if a formal proof is still not available, good arguments are discussed to conjecture its completeness. <p> This kind of reasoning is found in hierarchical planners like Nonlin (Tate, 1977), Sipe (Wilkins, 1988) and Forbin (Dean, Firby, & Miller, 1990).
