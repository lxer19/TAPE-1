Abstract: We study grasps of multifinger dexterous hands under the point contact model. Specifically, we are interested in high-quality force closure grasps. We abstract the problem into the space of force/torque wrenches where the quality is proportional to the magnitude of the largest wrench expressed as a non-negative combination of the grasp wrenches. This abstraction enables us to solve the problem by application of quantitative versions of Steinitz's theorem. We prove such a version by a geometric construction and specify an algorithm to select d(d + 3)=2 wrenches (or points) in d dimensions that guarantee quality 1=d. This is the first general solution, with practical significance, to the grasping problem. We also modify the problem by letting the quality be part of the input and show a lower bound as well as a heuristic solution for determining the number of wrenches required. The extension of the antipodal algorithm leads to interesting observations but fails to generalize. Lastly, we impose some structure on the wrench space, which is more realistically viewed as a generalized cylinder. This suggests satisfactory solutions for certain specific cases.

Reference-contexts: One, computing bounds on the number of fingers required and sufficient for a force closure grasp. Second, how to determine where to place the fingers of a force closure grasp. Satisfactory solutions have been presented in a few papers such as <ref> [1] </ref>, [7], [8], [6], [5], in chronological order. However, none of this papers answered the question of how good these grasps are.

Reference-contexts: This direction of research was motivated by the work of Kirkpatrick, Mishra and Yap in [4]. Quantitative Steinitz's theorems determine the number of points required to guarantee a positive inner radius among an input set of points with unit inner radius. A first such result from <ref> [2] </ref> states that 2d points can guarantee inner radius larger than d 2d , for arbitrary positive dimension d. This implies, for d = 3, 6 points with inner radius 1:3 10 3 .

Reference-contexts: In short, the cones K associated with the points of inner radius must cover the d-dimensional sphere. If A (d 1; ) denotes the total surface area of S d1 then, with the help of <ref> [3] </ref>, we get A (d 1; ) = 2 0 A (d 1; ) = 2 1+bd1=2c dd1=2e =(d 2)!!: where (d 2)!! = (d 2)(d 4) (l + 2)l and l is 2 or 1, depending on whether d is even or odd.

Reference-contexts: The idea of studying the quality of grasps was first suggested in [6], where the problem was solved for a very special setting. Two papers that appeared last year continued work on this theme, namely <ref> [4] </ref> and [9]. Different approaches use different measures of quality. For our purposes, we first need the following Definition 2 A force/torque wrench or simply a wrench is a vector with two groups of coordinates. The first describes a force, the second describes a torque. <p> The quality of grasps computed in this way equals the inner radius of the selected input points, since the original inner radius is 1. This direction of research was motivated by the work of Kirkpatrick, Mishra and Yap in <ref> [4] </ref>. Quantitative Steinitz's theorems determine the number of points required to guarantee a positive inner radius among an input set of points with unit inner radius. A first such result from [2] states that 2d points can guarantee inner radius larger than d 2d , for arbitrary positive dimension d. <p> A first such result from [2] states that 2d points can guarantee inner radius larger than d 2d , for arbitrary positive dimension d. This implies, for d = 3, 6 points with inner radius 1:3 10 3 . The central result of <ref> [4] </ref> guarantees inner radius larger than 1 3d ( 2d 2 m ) d1 , where the number of points is m 13 d d d+3 2 . For a 3-d wrench space, this translates to more than 59; 000 points with inner radius larger than 0:997. <p> The generalized octahedron demonstrates another choice of a regular polyhedron that will prove useful below. A third alternative is, of course, the generalized cube, which was used in <ref> [4] </ref>. This guarantees grasps with roughly d2 d wrenches and quality 1= p 2. <p> However, this does not affect the number of points significantly, since the initial number of points grows exponentially with d. Clearly, this approach will be practical only for large d and for approaching 1. Recall the results in <ref> [4] </ref> and the generalized cube we mentioned above. If we let our initial set of vertices be the vertices of the generalized cube, there are 2 d initial points with inner radius 1= 2. <p> Our method provides a constructive proof to a quantitative version of Steinitz's theorem and is based on inscribing the largest-volume simplex polyhedron in the d-dimensional sphere. This is the first method for arbitrary dimension d of the wrench space that removes the requirement of <ref> [4] </ref> for an exponential number of fingers. Simultaneously, it is very competitive when compared to the results of the antipodal algorithm. We also examined another approach at proving quantitative versions of Steinitz's theorem, by specifying the desired inner radius of the point subset in the input.

We shall briefly discuss his algorithm and then attempt to extend this approach into higher dimension, as proposed in his paper. Unfortunately, this attempt was not successful and we present a counter-example in 3-dimensional wrench space for which the generalization fails.
