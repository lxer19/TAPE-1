Reference-contexts: Hence, researchers continue to work on schemes that allow multimedia communication through the tolerance of losses. For example, the researchers at the International Computer Science Institute have developed one such resilient scheme, called Priority Encoding Transmission (PET). <ref> [1] </ref>. With such schemes in place, and with the judicious application of other techniques, multimedia communication over a lossy network like the Internet can become a reality. For example, consider the many Internet Phones or Web Phones that have appeared on the market in recent months. <p> Suffice to say that these techniques require complex algorithms and a substantial amount of computation time, but they result in good quality speech at very low bit rates, on the order of 1-15 Kbps. 3.2 Coding for resilience Priority Encoding Transmission and Wavelets Priority Encoding Transmission, first introduced in <ref> [1] </ref> and described briefly in [15] is an efficient Forward Error Correction scheme that deals with different levels of priority. In essence, it provides its users with the ability to set different loss probabilities on different portions of their data, allowing for the graceful degradation of a data stream.

Reference-contexts: It has been demonstrated that a PET protected MPEG stream could result in less distorted pictures in the face of network losses [17]. Subsequently, a new version of the PET algorithm <ref> [2] </ref> and an MPEG CODEC was integrated into a version of VIC [19], the standard video conferencing tool used on the MBone. The resultant software [16] showed that PET protected MPEG video was less distorted and resulted in subjectively better video quality when there were network losses.

Reference-contexts: In this way, losses can be detected and dealt with if necessary, and the application can decide whether retransmission is both necessary and tractable. ICSI Audio Laboratory Version 0.1 2 Problems 13 Bolot studied the characteristics of end-to-end packet delays and losses in the Internet <ref> [3] </ref>; and more recently, in his joint work with Crepin and Vega Garcia [4], he dealt with an analysis of audio packet loss in the Internet. Both studies were neither long-term studies (in [3], tests lasted only 10 mins) nor comprehensive. <p> 0.1 2 Problems 13 Bolot studied the characteristics of end-to-end packet delays and losses in the Internet <ref> [3] </ref>; and more recently, in his joint work with Crepin and Vega Garcia [4], he dealt with an analysis of audio packet loss in the Internet. Both studies were neither long-term studies (in [3], tests lasted only 10 mins) nor comprehensive. For example, only one packet size was used in both studies (32 bytes in [3] and the IVS default fixed size of 320 samples per packet in [4]). <p> Both studies were neither long-term studies (in <ref> [3] </ref>, tests lasted only 10 mins) nor comprehensive. For example, only one packet size was used in both studies (32 bytes in [3] and the IVS default fixed size of 320 samples per packet in [4]). In the second study, at most two samples were taken on one particular day for each of their two test routes.

Reference-contexts: Hartmut Chodura of the Fraunhofer-IGD is working on a multi-platform digital telephone application <ref> [5] </ref> that will incorporate resilient coding (PET) as well as digital signal processing techniques that deal with the non-transport problems associated with audio communication over networks (especially long haul networks). <p> For instance, PictureTel has an excellent echo cancelation algorithm that works on a low-cost Texas Instrument DSP chip. With workstation computation power growing exponentially though, it might be possible, in the near future, to implement a decent echo canceler purely in software. In that respect, Chodura and Storn <ref> [5] </ref> have proposed a degradable echo canceler, which adapts to the processing power available and attempts to provide the best echo cancelation given the computation constraints.

Presently, with greater bandwidths, there is a move towards using the Internet for other types of communications. Despite the creation of the MBone <ref> [9, 18] </ref>, the multimedia backbone, multimedia communication over the Internet is at best limited. Some of the reasons for the slow acceptance of multimedia communication include bandwidth limitations, the presence of packet losses on the Internet and high variability in traffic conditions.

Reference-contexts: PET can then be applied to the wavelet coefficients, putting more redundancy on the larger magnitude coefficients. As an added feature, we can also factor in psycho acoustic effects <ref> [21] </ref> into our calculation of priorities. Our aim in calculating priorities will be to achieve a prioritizing algorithm that is in direct correlation with perceived audio quality, while still working under the resource constraints of an average workstation.

Reference-contexts: Where audio coding is concerned, wavelets have been used successfully to get significant compression with good quality for both speech [30] and high quality monophonic CD signals <ref> [25] </ref>. For instance, discarding small wavelet coefficients for speech signals resulted in compression ratios between 1.3 and 14.3 depending on the length of the conjugate mirror filter used in the wavelet transform (the longer the filter, the better the compression, but the greater the computational complexity).

In the case of [25], through the employment of wavelet best basis selection, Sinha and Twefik managed to achieve almost transparent coding of monophonic CD quality signals (16-bit PCM, sampling rate of 44.1KHz bit rate of 705.6Kbps) at bit rates of 64-70Kbps.

Reference-contexts: BACKGROUND or network loads. It would be useful to implement some form of these adaptive algorithms and see if they are useful, feasible and result in more efficient audio transmission. Storn <ref> [26] </ref> proposes a fuzzy controller to adapt the PET-MPEG priority scheme to the network conditions. A similar approach could be taken with PET protected audio (whether through the use of wavelet encoding or other forms of encoding).
