Abstract: Recent studies on a floating building block representation for the genetic algorithm (GA) suggest that there are many advantages to using the floating representation. This paper investigates the behavior of the GA on floating representation problems in response to three different types of pressures: (1) a reduction in the amount of genetic material available to the GA during the problem solving process, (2) functions which have negative-valued building blocks, and (3) randomizing non-coding segments. Results indicate that the GA's performance on floating representation problems is very robust. Significant reductions in genetic material (genome length) may be made with relatively small decrease in performance. The GA can effectively solve problems with negative building blocks. Randomizing non-coding segments appears to improve rather than harm GA performance.

Reference-contexts: Negative building blocks have negative fitness contributions that decrease an individual's fitness. However, a negative building block may be part of a larger, positive building block. This situation is similar to the deceptive problems described in <ref> (Goldberg 1989) </ref> where building blocks that are discouraged/encouraged early in a run may/may not lead to the optimum individual. Initial experiments showed find the optimum vs. level of negative building blocks: 32x8.FRR2. that one or two negative building blocks had little effect on GA performance.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Intelligent natural systems are complexly structured, modular organisms. Acting over billions of years, evolution has created organisms by combining simple components into more complex systems through selection from a diverse population of varied individuals. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) was pioneered by Holland <ref> (Holland 1975) </ref> as an abstract model of evolution based upon only a few of its then-known salient features.

Reference-contexts: Royal Road Functions The RR functions are a class of functions that were designed for studying building block interactions <ref> (Mitchell, Forrest, & Holland 1991) </ref>. Building blocks in the GA are groups of bits that affect the fitness of an individual. The RR functions have multiple levels of hierarchically arranged building blocks. All building blocks are defined and assigned optimum patterns and fitness contributions before a run begins.

Instead of defining building blocks by their location on an individual, the existence and placement of building blocks depend on the existence and placement of predefined tags.
