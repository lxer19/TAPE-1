Reference-contexts: Word frequency data of a sequence compared with databases representing defined sequence classes can provide a useful first step in the classification of a sequence into functional domains. Claverie and Bougueleret <ref> (Claverie and Bougueleret, 1986) </ref> calculated frequencies of words up to 4- and 9-long found in protein and nucleic acid sequence databases, respectively, and then used this information to find words occuring in a query sequence.

Reference-contexts: One potential extension to this approach is to use frequencies of all word lengths found in the query sequence that occur in sequence class databases. The result of this analysis can be represented as a sequence landscape or a matrix array of frequency values above the query sequence <ref> (Clift et al., 1986) </ref>. This approach previously illustrated the presence of repeating motifs and underep-resented words in bacteriophage genomes. However, the sequence landscape is a general approach for the analysis of any textual alphabet, and thus can be applied to both DNA and protein sequences. <p> The occurrence of under-represented words in a region of sequence that potentially contains transcription factor binding site may serve to increase the specificity of transcription factor binding. The landscape approach previously identified the under-represented methylation sequence tetramer, GATC, in an analysis of the bacteriophage T7 genome <ref> (Clift et al., 1986) </ref>. <p> This graphical interface is an enhancement of the text-based interface that was developed previously <ref> (Clift et al., 1986) </ref>. A sequence landscape can be produced in real-time due to the indexing of the database and maintaining the suffix array of the database in RAM, enabling rapid querying of all sub-words contained within a query sequence.

Reference-contexts: Word frequencies can also be used to identify tandem or inverted repeating elements within a sequence (Lefevre and Ikeda, 1993), (Milosavljevic and Jurka, 1993), <ref> (Cox and Mirkin, 1997) </ref>. Tandem repeating DNA or protein elements have been implicated in nervous system development and related disorders (Karlin and Burge, 1996), (MacDonald and Gusella, 1996), (Zoghbi, 1997), (Nelson, 1993).

Therefore, the number and length of peaks provide a quantitative measure of similarity between these two sequences. This approach has been implimented previously by applying a minimal-length encoding algorithm <ref> (Milosavljevic and Jurka, 1993) </ref>. The extent of similarity between sequences can be measured by comparision of the degree of compression between sequences (Milosavljevic, 1994). The cells that constitute the top edge of a landscape provide the same information as the minimal-length encoding algorithm.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the nine-letter words indicated by the five landscape cells upstream from position 1229 are all identified as potential transcription factor binding sequences when this region is compared to the TRANSFAC database (version 3.2) using MatInspector 2.1 <ref> (Quandt et al., 1995) </ref>. Thus, the Markov landscape is very efficient in detecting functionally relevant sequences in this particular example. The "troughs" or "valleys" in a landscape indicate words that occur at a reduced frequency to adjacent words of the same length. <p> These putative transcriptional promoters were also detected by MatInspector version 2.1 <ref> (Quandt et al., 1995) </ref>, indicating that using all word frequencies can provide as useful a diagnostic feature as have been found for weight matrices for transcription factor binding sites (Prestridge, 1995) (Chen et al., 1997) (Hertz and Stormo, 1996).
