Abstract: An improved algorithm is presented for designing digital filters with coefficients expressed as sums of signed power-of-two (SPT) terms. Our algorithm, modifying that of [1], allocates SPT terms based on minimizing the filter's approximating error using two ` 1 norms, one in the time domain and one in the frequency domain. For any specified filter gain, the time complexity of the algorithm is a second-order polynomial in the filter order. Examples show that our improved algorithm is capable of designing filters with better characteristics while using fewer SPT terms.
