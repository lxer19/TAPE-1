Abstract: In this chapter we present a general purpose neural architecture for segmenting 2-D and 3-D medical images. The architecture is based on a continuous Hopfield neural network including one or more sets of 2-D layers of neurons with local connections. This architecture can be specialised to perform the segmentation of 2-D images, the multi-scale segmentation of 2-D images and the segmentation of 3-D images by simply changing the number of such sets and/or the size of the component layers. By changing synaptic weights the architecture can adapt to the differences existing between tomographic and radiographic images. The segmentation produced by this architecture is optimum with respect to a goodness criterion which establishes the tradeoff between sensitivity and robustness. The chapter describes the derivation of the architecture and some experimental results obtained with synthetic and real medical images.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge of statistical properties of the gray levels of the image is a kind a priori information that has been extensively exploited in the case of Magnetic Resonance (MR) and Computed Tomography (CT) images (see for example <ref> [23, 16, 9, 1, 20] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Normally this data needs no preprocessing and, therefore, the first step for solving the segmentation problem is finding a binary representation for its solutions. 3.1 Binary Representation We adopted a representation suggested by the analogy of the segmentation process with that of colouring geographic maps <ref> [2] </ref>. This analogy indicates that, in order to represent the regions ("states") obtained from the segmentation of an image, only a reduced number of labels ("colours") are needed, as long as different labels are associated to connected regions ("bordering states"). <p> We adopted an energy function partially inspired by the one 3 suggested in [12, 13] for the solution of the travelling-salesman problem and the one proposed in <ref> [2] </ref> for the segmentation of signals with simulated annealing. As the fixed points of Hopfield nets tend to be the vertices of the hypercube [0; 1] N , we were able to design E net on the hypothesis of binary neurons, i.e. v xyc 2 f0; 1g.

Reference-contexts: Spatial correlation is considered as more important in other methods, such as those based on mathematical morphology operators [10, 15, 27, 14], on rule-based expert systems <ref> [3, 18, 17] </ref>, on special 1 purpose computer vision techniques [22, 5, 8] or on neural nets trained with the backpropagation al-gorithm [26, 28, 6].

Reference-contexts: However, before doing that the state of the net has to be initialised. As the standard random initialisation method gives, in the present case, poor segmentation results, we adopted the strategy suggested in <ref> [4] </ref> which consists of initialising the network in an area of state space where a good solution is present. In this way the network has only to improve the solution instead of looking for it in the whole state space.
