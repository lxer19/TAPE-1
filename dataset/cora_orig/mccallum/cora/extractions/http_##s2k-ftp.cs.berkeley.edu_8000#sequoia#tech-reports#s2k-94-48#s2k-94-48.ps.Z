Abstract: In [STON93] we proposed a visual programming system called Tioga. The Tioga system applies a boxes and arrows programming notation to allow nonexpert users to graphically construct database applications. Users connect database procedures using a dataow model. Browsers are used to visualize the resulting data. This paper describes extensions to the Tioga browser protocol. These extensions allow sophisticated, ight-simulator navigation through a multidimensional data space. This design also incorporates wormholes to allow tunneling between different multidimensional spaces. Wormholes are shown to be substantial generalizations of hyperlinks in a hypertext system.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION The design of user interfaces for database systems is an area in need of more attention <ref> [BERN89, STON93b] </ref>. Existing database user interfaces are often unfriendly and difficult for nonexperts to use. Most database interfaces take the form of textual programming languages or forms-based interfaces oriented towards business applications. In [STON93], we presented Tioga, a new paradigm for user interaction with a database management system (DBMS).

Reference-contexts: The current navigational interface allows the user to pan over the two dimensions of the display or to zoom by enlarging a certain portion of the display. Clearly, more sophisticated navigation is desirable. In [STON93], we explored the basic constructs of Tioga, and provided a query execution model. In <ref> [CHEN93] </ref>, we expanded the Tioga model to interface to foreign systems and provided a notion of transactions for the Tioga environment. In this companion paper, we explore navigation in multidimensional space. Our extensions to Tioga include: enhanced detail.

Tioga is motivated by the needs of scientific DBMS users in the SEQUOIA 2000 project <ref> [DOZI92, STON92, STON93a] </ref>. Tioga uses the boxes and arrows notation popularized by scientific visualization systems such as AVS [UPSO89], Data Explorer [LUCA92], and Khoros [RASU92]. Tioga improves upon these systems by providing sophisticated data management using the POSTGRES DBMS [STON91].

Reference-contexts: For example, the Kodak photoCD representation for digital images supports a 2K by 3K by 8-bit color image format, and in addition provides four other images of lesser resolution culminating in a 128 by 192 by 8-bit abstract <ref> [EAST92] </ref>. A user would like the ability to see abstracts on the screen and then zoom in to view the images at a higher resolution. A similar feature was provided by SDMS [HERO80], but it was hard-coded into that execution engine.

Hence, retargeting SDMS required a considerable Data Displayed in the Tioga Browser amount of customization. changing multidimensional spaces. Enhanced detail implies a change in perspective within a multidimensional space. Users also want the ability to switch to a new multidimensional space.

Reference-contexts: At this point, a new application is invoked. Using the concept of wormholes, a user can move from one multidimensional space to another. The reader can readily observe that wormholes are a substantial generalization of hyperlinks in a hypertext system <ref> [NIEL90, MARC88] </ref>. A hyperlink is a wormhole in which there is a prespecified object or collection of objects on each side of the hole. Wormholes allow a run-time specified set of objects to be on each side. 4.
