Abstract: Membership queries extended with the meta query concept is proposed as a method to acquire complex classification rules. Furthermore, relevent concept classes, where a small number of queries is sufficient, are characterized. In this paper we advocate and present the benefits of the use of queries in order to learn a target concept efficiently. Thus providing the foundations for automating the knowledge acquisition process. Based on these results, we developed a knowledge acquisition tool KAC-Z which uses queries about specific domain objects. The systems usefulness has been demonstrated by its application in the domain of manufacturing (cutting) industry.

Reference-contexts: For example, Sammut and Banerji's system [7] uses membership queries about specific examples as part of its strategy for efficiently learning a target concept. Let us consider the problem of using queries in order to learn an unknown concept. For this purpose Angluin <ref> [1] </ref> suggested different types of queries. Among these query types are membership queries which ask for the correct classification of a particular object. Furthermore, she proved that for many concept classes an exhaustive or nearly exhaustive search is necessary when using membership queries. <p> In this case, there is a worst case lower bound on the required number of membership queries of m 1. I.e., a (nearly) exhaustive search is necessary. (See <ref> [1] </ref> for proofs of lower bounds for various types of queries.) Nevertheless, in certain cases the number of required membership queries can be reduced dramatically if initially the learning system is provided with one positive example of the target concept c t .

The Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of C, in short VC-Dim (C), is the cardinality of the greatest set s X shattered by C.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In building expert systems the knowledge acquisition is considered to be a bottleneck <ref> [3] </ref>. This is due to the fact that acquiring knowledge from an expert is generally time-consuming and error-prone. Thus, one is motivated to overcome this bottleneck by automating the knowledge acquisition, i.e. through building learning components for expert systems [4].

Thus, one is motivated to overcome this bottleneck by automating the knowledge acquisition, i.e. through building learning components for expert systems <ref> [4] </ref>. A successful learning component in an expert system will probably have to use queries directed towards the experts. For example, Sammut and Banerji's system [7] uses membership queries about specific examples as part of its strategy for efficiently learning a target concept.

Reference-contexts: The following results are also applicable in the case of learning multiple classes instead of learning just one class as pointed out in <ref> [5] </ref>. In section 2.1 we define the property of a concept class being independently monotonic. This property allows to learn a concept from C with a small number of queries.

Furthermore, she proved that for many concept classes an exhaustive or nearly exhaustive search is necessary when using membership queries. However, in <ref> [6] </ref> concept classes have been introduced where efficient learning via various queries is possible. In the present paper these concept classes are significantly extended by introducing the notion of meta queries. Meta queries ask for hints how to construct complex classification rules.
