Measurement noise may make the device appear to be very 46 slightly active instead of very slightly passive." <ref> [1] </ref> With the computed S-parameters which are evaluated from the parasitic functions, they never violate the power conservation rule and hence are always stable for a passive system.

Reference-contexts: Due to the high switching speed of today's digital systems, the magnitudes of the harmonics of the transmitted signals above 1 GHz can often become the significant components in the power spectrum [29] [48] <ref> [2] </ref> [14] [28] [44]. At these high frequencies, the interconnects exhibit more frequency-dependent behaviour resulting from conductor losses (skin effect) and dielectric losses (dispersion) [44]. The electro-static field solution can no longer predict the correct parasitics for the interconnects that carry the high-speed digital signals. <p> S-parameter macromodel simulator is well suited for this kind of application. 19 3.1 Representing the Frequency-Dependent Coupled Transmission Lines Using the S-Parameter Macromodel Previous research which took frequency-dependent losses into consideration include the work of Gruodis et al. [29], Schutt-Aine et al. [48], Chang et al. [8], Beyene [4], Baumgartner <ref> [2] </ref>, Cooke et al. [14], Gordon et al.

Beyene combined the bi-level waveform relaxation with scattering parameters [4]. Baumgartner used a state variable transfer function with an exponential approximation <ref> [2] </ref>. Cooke et al. chose the scattering parameter frequency domain simulation with the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) method [14]. Gordon et al. used the impulse response convolution method [28], and Nguyen used the state variable transfer function with the rational function approximation improvement [44]. <p> When taking advantage of the fact that the L (f ), C (f ) and G (f ) are weak functions of frequency and the R (f ) is a strong function of frequency <ref> [2] </ref>, the moments of these four parasitic functions are much simpler to find. The input is the measured S-parameter data tabulated w.r.t. the sampling frequencies. The output is the moments of the parasitic functions. R (f ), L (f ), C (f ) and G (f ).

The bi-level waveform relaxation method adopted by Beyene <ref> [4] </ref> utilized the FFT and the inverse FFT (IFFT) to iterate between the frequency domain simulation and the time domain simulation. <p> To incorporate the macromodel of the frequency-dependent decoupling networks into the S-parameter macromodel simulator presents a very difficult challenge. The decoupling networks are known to be represented by a matrix with frequency-dependent elements <ref> [4] </ref>. This process requires the finding of a frequency-dependent transformation matrix in order to decouple the system. It is a complex process and requires the eigenvalues at each frequency point prior to diagonalization.

Reference-contexts: Taking the Laplace transform of the Equation (3.33) and (3.34), they can be rewritten as: @x @I (x; s) = YV (x; s); (3.36) where Z = R + jwL, and Y = G + jwC. Throughout this thesis, the following assumptions reported by Blazeck et al. are used <ref> [5] </ref>. The assumptions are: the modes of propagation must be TEM or quasi-TEM, and the lines are of uniform cross-section throughout their length; that is, R, L, C, and G are assumed to be constant with respect to the spatial variable x. <p> Solving Equation (3.35) and (3.36), one has: @ 2 V (x; s) @ 2 I (x; s) where T indicates transpose and is defined as 2 = ZY <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Doing without the termination eliminates the heat generated by the terminator and solves the heat removal problem. Unterminated, the long lines in the substrate are structured to exhibit a total resistance that is related to the source resistance of the active devices which drives the lines [31] <ref> [6] </ref>. For performance reasons, slightly under-damped designs give shorter signal propagation delays with a tolerable amount of overshoot [6] [23] [31]. <p> Unterminated, the long lines in the substrate are structured to exhibit a total resistance that is related to the source resistance of the active devices which drives the lines [31] <ref> [6] </ref>. For performance reasons, slightly under-damped designs give shorter signal propagation delays with a tolerable amount of overshoot [6] [23] [31]. These lines are thus called optimal self-damped lossy transmission lines [25]. 5.1 Wire-Sizing In order to have a MCM design that meets all the electrical performance requirements, one needs to control the delay, the noise, and the impedance through geometry parameters. <p> The choice of the Lagrange Multiplier also has some hill-climbing property similar to simulated annealing so as to avoid a local minimum. The Levenberg-Marquardt Method is chosen as the optimization method throughout this thesis. 5.4 Previous Work Papers published by Brews <ref> [6] </ref> and Frye [25] show design methods for the design of critically damped point-to-point interconnections on VLSI and MCM. Another paper published by Cong et al. [13] uses wire-sizing to achieve optimal design for the tree network based upon the distributed-RC model [13]. <p> The damping ratio and the propagation delay will be used together in the optimal wire sizing process. According to the ITAE criterion, the best transient performance happens when = 1 p 2 65 a second order system [49] [22] [33] <ref> [6] </ref>. This value will be used as the target of optimization method in all the experiments. For higher order systems, the coefficients of the approximated transfer functions are used. For a given input waveform in the time domain, these coefficients uniquely determine the time domain response waveform at the receiver. <p> All of the receivers are modeled using a 2:5pF capacitor. The damping ratio target is chosen to be 1 p 2 shorter propagation delay with a controlled amount of overshoot <ref> [6] </ref> [33] [22] [49] [17].

The crosstalk can often lead to excessive overshoots, undershoots and glitches. It can also cause false switchings on the non-active lines as well as undetected switchings on the active lines, not to mention that it can also increase power dissipation of the output drivers. <p> Due to the high switching speed of today's digital systems, the magnitudes of the harmonics of the transmitted signals above 1 GHz can often become the significant components in the power spectrum [29] [48] [2] <ref> [14] </ref> [28] [44]. At these high frequencies, the interconnects exhibit more frequency-dependent behaviour resulting from conductor losses (skin effect) and dielectric losses (dispersion) [44]. The electro-static field solution can no longer predict the correct parasitics for the interconnects that carry the high-speed digital signals. <p> Transient Analysis of Coupled Transmission Lines Previous research work which uses scattering parameter for the analysis of the coupled transmission lines include those of the general convolution by Winklestein et al. [57], the full-wave analysis by Cooke et al. <ref> [14] </ref> and time domain simulation by Schutt-Aine et al. [48]. While Schutt-Aine et al. demonstrated a great accuracy improvements in simulating circuits that includes non-linear drivers and terminations, Cooke et al. illustrated an ability to simulate frequency dependent model propagation. <p> This approach avoids the costly matrix computation for converting the frequency domain scattering-parameter matrix representation into the one of time domain transfer/reflection matrix as in [48], and the time consuming full-wave analysis as in <ref> [14] </ref>. It has been shown that the congruence transformation can be used to decouple the modal wave propagation in a coupled transmission-line system [7] [9] [30] [46]. <p> All of the far-end waveforms are simulated with time-of-flight captured explicitly [37]. The circuit and geometry parameters of this example as shown in Figure 2.3 are taken from Cooke's paper <ref> [14] </ref>. The driving signal is 100-MHz, 50% duty-cycle pulse with 0:1ns rise/fall time. <p> The simulation waveforms of this example are shown in Figure 2.5 (a), (b), (c), and (d). The ASTAP (IBM circuit simulator) and Cooke's simulation waveforms are digitized from the results published in Cooke's paper <ref> [14] </ref> while the SWEC results are taken from MCMC-94 benchmark results. The SWEC uses an analytic method to find the derivatives of the admittance in order to compute the moments and because of its complexity, it can only find very low order moments [41]. <p> well suited for this kind of application. 19 3.1 Representing the Frequency-Dependent Coupled Transmission Lines Using the S-Parameter Macromodel Previous research which took frequency-dependent losses into consideration include the work of Gruodis et al. [29], Schutt-Aine et al. [48], Chang et al. [8], Beyene [4], Baumgartner [2], Cooke et al. <ref> [14] </ref>, Gordon et al. [28], and Nguyen [44]. Gruodis et al. measured the admittance matrix Y 2n and impedance matrix Z 2n of the transmission lines, computed the Y 0 matrix and propagation constant , and then simulated the circuit's transient behavior using the state variable transfer function method [29]. <p> Beyene combined the bi-level waveform relaxation with scattering parameters [4]. Baumgartner used a state variable transfer function with an exponential approximation [2]. Cooke et al. chose the scattering parameter frequency domain simulation with the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) method <ref> [14] </ref>. Gordon et al. used the impulse response convolution method [28], and Nguyen used the state variable transfer function with the rational function approximation improvement [44]. In some of these previous researches including those by Schutt-Aine et al. [48], Beyene [4], and Cooke et al. [14], they chose to use the <p> Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) method <ref> [14] </ref>. Gordon et al. used the impulse response convolution method [28], and Nguyen used the state variable transfer function with the rational function approximation improvement [44]. In some of these previous researches including those by Schutt-Aine et al. [48], Beyene [4], and Cooke et al. [14], they chose to use the scattering parameter for the analysis of the transmission lines with the frequency-dependent losses. <p> The deficiency of Beyene's method is the need for more than one thousand data points in order to do the evaluation of the FFT (IFFT) operation with the same degree of accuracy as other approaches. The scattering parameter frequency domain simulation with the FFT method by Cooke et al. <ref> [14] </ref> uses all the scattering parameters without reduction. The drawbacks of Cooke et al. method are its poor efficiency and its lack of accuracy when compared 20 to the published ASTAP results. <p> function can again be found through simple backward substitutions. 3.3 S-Parameter Macromodel of the Frequency-Dependent Coupled Transmission Line Previous research which used scattering parameter for the analysis of the coupled transmission lines include those of the general convolution by Winklestein et al. [57], the full-wave analysis by Cooke et al. <ref> [14] </ref> and the time domain transient simulation by Schutt-Aine et al. [48]. <p> Cooke et al. illustrated an ability to simulate frequency dependent modal propagation, but a time consuming full-wave analysis was often required <ref> [14] </ref>. Recently, a novel frequency domain simulator using scattering parameter based macromodels has been presented by Liao et al [39] [40]. Based on the scattering parameter based macromodel, Pade techniques or Exponentially Decayed Polynomial Function (EDPF) can be used to approximate transfer functions of the coupled interconnects.

Reference-contexts: Although these two problems have different objective functions, optimizing the transformed problem can produces a solution to the original Min-Max problem. Thus for non-linear Least Square Estimation problems, the Levenberg-Marquardt method is recommended [15] [36] <ref> [16] </ref>. The Levenberg-Marquardt Method is used in single variable optimization by transforming the original Min-Max problem into the Least-Square Estimation (LSE) problem. To use it in the nonlinear programming problem such that multiple objectives must be simultaneously minimized together, one must change the transformation. <p> At first, the linear fit is run on each data set to obtain two coefficients as the initial assignment for the successive curve-fitting steps. Then the problem of finding the coefficients of the polynomials are transformed into one of the least-square error estimation. The Levenberg-Marquardt method [42] <ref> [16] </ref> is used to solve this least-square error estimation problem. This method is chosen because it combines the best features of both the Taylor series expansion and the gradient methods. <p> Thus these diagonal eigenvalue matrices can be used to form the macromodels using a method outlined in the Section 3.2. Once the tabulated S-parameter data for the congruence transformation have been found, a curve-fitting using Levenberg-Marquardt method [42] <ref> [16] </ref> is used to find the coefficients for the construction of the congruence transformer: X (f ). <p> The S-parameter data sets are computed from the moments of the parasitic functions based upon analytic equations. The Levenberg-Marquardt optimization method is used to find the moments of the parasitic functions through comparing the computed S-parameter and the original measured S-parameter data <ref> [16] </ref>. The partial derivatives of the least-square error between these two S-parameter data sets w.r.t. each of the moments of the parasitic functions are obtained using a perturbation method [43]. Assume the initial coefficients are C (0) , and there are total m coefficients. <p> Assume the initial coefficients are C (0) , and there are total m coefficients. The next coefficients C (k+1) can be computed from the previous coefficients C (k) , which according to Levenberg-Marquardt, is optimized according to the following formula [42] <ref> [16] </ref>: C (k+1) = C (k) (J T J + fl) 1 J T @ LSE # where k is the number of iteration, C (k) the column vector of the k th iteration, and LSE the least-square error. <p> T is the transposition vector of J where 52 the j th element J T (j) = J (j), fl is a value which are equal to the product of J T J, and is the Lagrange Multiplier properly selected to speed up the convergence of the optimization process [42] <ref> [16] </ref>. J T h @c j represents the gradient around the current coefficients C (k) . To obtain the sensitivity matrix J, the j th element is defined as: J (j) = @c j The partial derivatives are computed using a central difference method. <p> It is chosen as the target for the approximated transfer function. 5.3 Levenberg-Marquardt Method Most algorithms for solving the Least-Square Estimation problems involving nonlinear parameters have been centered around either the Taylor series method or the Gradient method <ref> [16] </ref>. Both of these methods have advantages depending on the applications. In the Taylor series method, the objective function is expanded as a Taylor series and the corrections to the nonlinear parameters are calculated at each iteration based upon the assumption of local linearity. <p> The Levenberg-Marquardt Method tries to perform an optimum interpolation between the Taylor series method and the Gradient method so that the size and the direction of the steps can be determined simultaneously [36] <ref> [16] </ref>. The properties proved in Levenberg-Marquardt's paper show that their method combines the best features of the previous two methods and generally avoids their limitations [42]. The Levenberg-Marquardt Method benefits from the maximum neighborhood in which the truncated Taylor series gives an adequate linearized representation of the nonlinear objective function. <p> Equation (5.8) and maximum damping ratio error G (w 1 ; w 2 ; : : : ; w n ) defined in Equation (5.9) of the original nonlinear programming problem. 5.9 Implementation of the Least-Square Estimation Optimization The Levenberg-Marquardt method is used to solve the least-square estimation problem [42] <ref> [16] </ref>. Theorems 1 and 2 show the consistency between the minimizing of the original problem and the minimizing of the transformed root-mean-square estimation problem.

Reference-contexts: At first, the linear fit is run on each data set to obtain two coefficients as the initial assignment for the successive curve-fitting steps. Then the problem of finding the coefficients of the polynomials are transformed into one of the least-square error estimation. The Levenberg-Marquardt method <ref> [42] </ref> [16] is used to solve this least-square error estimation problem. This method is chosen because it combines the best features of both the Taylor series expansion and the gradient methods. <p> Thus these diagonal eigenvalue matrices can be used to form the macromodels using a method outlined in the Section 3.2. Once the tabulated S-parameter data for the congruence transformation have been found, a curve-fitting using Levenberg-Marquardt method <ref> [42] </ref> [16] is used to find the coefficients for the construction of the congruence transformer: X (f ). <p> Assume the initial coefficients are C (0) , and there are total m coefficients. The next coefficients C (k+1) can be computed from the previous coefficients C (k) , which according to Levenberg-Marquardt, is optimized according to the following formula <ref> [42] </ref> [16]: C (k+1) = C (k) (J T J + fl) 1 J T @ LSE # where k is the number of iteration, C (k) the column vector of the k th iteration, and LSE the least-square error. <p> J T is the transposition vector of J where 52 the j th element J T (j) = J (j), fl is a value which are equal to the product of J T J, and is the Lagrange Multiplier properly selected to speed up the convergence of the optimization process <ref> [42] </ref> [16].

To obtain the sensitivity matrix J, the j th element is defined as: J (j) = @c j The partial derivatives are computed using a central difference method. <p> The optimization continues until the least-square error can no longer be improved, or the iteration number exceeds a preset limit.

Reference-contexts: namely the crosstalk among multi-conductors and the frequency dependence of the parasitics. 2 As the system clock speed increases, the crosstalk becomes one of the major source of noise, in addition to the delay and ringing which can limit the performance of high-speed digital systems [7] [9] [12] [14] [19] <ref> [46] </ref> [26] [48] [57]. The crosstalk can often lead to excessive overshoots, undershoots and glitches. It can also cause false switchings on the non-active lines as well as undetected switchings on the active lines, not to mention that it can also increase power dissipation of the output drivers. <p> It has been shown that the congruence transformation can be used to decouple the modal wave propagation in a coupled transmission-line system [7] [9] [30] <ref> [46] </ref>. After decoupling the n coupled transmission lines using the congruence transformation, the task of computing the scattering matrix of the coupled transmission lines then becomes the task of computing the scattering matrix of the congruence transformers and that of the n decoupled single transmission lines. <p> Chang's method for the analysis of coupled transmission lines relies on simultaneously diagonalizing all the matrices using a special conditioned matrix. Romeo and Santomauro present a different method of finding the right eigenvector matrices for coupled lossless transmission lines with tridiagonal L and C matrices <ref> [46] </ref>. In this part of the thesis, we find the right eigenvector matrices of a full L matrix. The method proposed here for the lossless case is preferred to Chang's method [7] because it leads to simpler equations for scattering parameter based macromodel representation of congruence transformer.

Reference-contexts: crosstalk among multi-conductors and the frequency dependence of the parasitics. 2 As the system clock speed increases, the crosstalk becomes one of the major source of noise, in addition to the delay and ringing which can limit the performance of high-speed digital systems [7] [9] [12] [14] [19] [46] [26] <ref> [48] </ref> [57]. The crosstalk can often lead to excessive overshoots, undershoots and glitches. It can also cause false switchings on the non-active lines as well as undetected switchings on the active lines, not to mention that it can also increase power dissipation of the output drivers. <p> Due to the high switching speed of today's digital systems, the magnitudes of the harmonics of the transmitted signals above 1 GHz can often become the significant components in the power spectrum [29] <ref> [48] </ref> [2] [14] [28] [44]. At these high frequencies, the interconnects exhibit more frequency-dependent behaviour resulting from conductor losses (skin effect) and dielectric losses (dispersion) [44]. The electro-static field solution can no longer predict the correct parasitics for the interconnects that carry the high-speed digital signals. <p> Transient Analysis of Coupled Transmission Lines Previous research work which uses scattering parameter for the analysis of the coupled transmission lines include those of the general convolution by Winklestein et al. [57], the full-wave analysis by Cooke et al. [14] and time domain simulation by Schutt-Aine et al. <ref> [48] </ref>. While Schutt-Aine et al. demonstrated a great accuracy improvements in simulating circuits that includes non-linear drivers and terminations, Cooke et al. illustrated an ability to simulate frequency dependent model propagation. Recently, a novel frequency domain simulator using scattering-parameter macromodels has been presented by Liao et al [39] [40]. <p> Based on the scattering-parameter macromodel, Pade techniques or Exponentially Decayed Polynomial Function (EDPF) can be used to approximate transfer functions of the coupled interconnects. This approach avoids the costly matrix computation for converting the frequency domain scattering-parameter matrix representation into the one of time domain transfer/reflection matrix as in <ref> [48] </ref>, and the time consuming full-wave analysis as in [14]. It has been shown that the congruence transformation can be used to decouple the modal wave propagation in a coupled transmission-line system [7] [9] [30] [46]. <p> The S-parameter macromodel simulator is well suited for this kind of application. 19 3.1 Representing the Frequency-Dependent Coupled Transmission Lines Using the S-Parameter Macromodel Previous research which took frequency-dependent losses into consideration include the work of Gruodis et al. [29], Schutt-Aine et al. <ref> [48] </ref>, Chang et al. [8], Beyene [4], Baumgartner [2], Cooke et al. [14], Gordon et al. [28], and Nguyen [44]. <p> Schutt-Aine et al. utilized the scattering parameter matrix method <ref> [48] </ref>. Chang et al. chose the "method of characteristic" with a network synthesis [8]. Beyene combined the bi-level waveform relaxation with scattering parameters [4]. Baumgartner used a state variable transfer function with an exponential approximation [2]. <p> Gordon et al. used the impulse response convolution method [28], and Nguyen used the state variable transfer function with the rational function approximation improvement [44]. In some of these previous researches including those by Schutt-Aine et al. <ref> [48] </ref>, Beyene [4], and Cooke et al. [14], they chose to use the scattering parameter for the analysis of the transmission lines with the frequency-dependent losses. The scattering parameter matrix method adopted by Schutt-Aine et al.

[48] used those of S11 (s) and S21 (s) to find the transmission T (t) and reflection (t) matrix for the time domain convolution. The drawback of this Schutt-Aine method is the large number of matrix operations that were required. <p> Macromodel of the Frequency-Dependent Coupled Transmission Line Previous research which used scattering parameter for the analysis of the coupled transmission lines include those of the general convolution by Winklestein et al.

It is very important to accurately model the frequency dependence of the parasitics for the case of the coupled transmission lines. <p> The existence of such eigenvector matrix X, that simultaneously diagonalize the complex matrices , 2 , ZY, and YZ, is assumed throughout this thesis. This assumption is also adopted by Gordon et al. [28], Blazeck et al. [5] and Schutt-Aine et al. <ref> [48] </ref>. Gordon et al. suggested that the frequency-dependent congruence transformer can be found by performing the congruence decoupling at each frequency point, and by checking the orthogonality of all the eigenvectors for all the frequency points [28].
