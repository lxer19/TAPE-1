Title: A Complete Picture of the Energy Consumption of a Portable Computer  
Author: Jacob R. Lorch 
Abstract: High battery lifetime is important to the usability and acceptance of portable computers. In order to develop strategies to minimize power consumption, designers need a good picture of the total power consumption of a system. For this purpose, we indicate the power consumptions of a set of portable computers and how they are broken down among the components of those computers. Then, we use user profiles to show how the use of power-saving features currently implemented serves to reduce these power consumptions by 35-56%. We also show how these power-saving features affect the breakdown of overall power consumption, so that we can evaluate how successful certain new software techniques and hardware changes would be at reducing power consumption. The results of this paper point out the most promising avenues for further work in the reduction of power consumption, and indicate some strategies that can provide an immediate power benefit to the class of machines studied.

Reference-contexts: Recently available disk drives made for the portable market, such as the HP Kittyhawk C3014A and the Caviar Ultralite CU140, also exhibit noticeable power reduction compared to their predecessors. A final example is due to Douglis et al. <ref> [13] </ref>, who suggest using a type of nonvolatile storage called flash memory as a low-power substitute for the hard drive. Another way to increase battery lifetime is to take better advantage of the low-power states of portable system components. <p> This paper Used in Duo 280c: 8.4", intensity 70 cd=m 2 3.40 W This paper Toshiba 9.5", intensity 60 cd=m 2 3.45 W fl [9] Toshiba 9.5", intensity 70 cd=m 2 4.14 W fl [9] Hard drive HP Kittyhawk C3014A 0.72 W fl [23] Caviar Ultralite CU140 0.81 W fl <ref> [13] </ref> Used in Dell 320SLi 0.90 W [12] Used in Duo 230 0.96 W This paper Used in Zenith Mastersport SLe 1.00 W [12] IBM DB0A-2720 1.09 W fl [18] Used in Sharp PC 6785 1.10 W [16] Quantum Go*Drive 1.15 W fl [12] Maxtor MXL-105 III 1.15 W fl [19] <p> For instance, if the new hard drive had bigger track buffers, and thus needed to seek less often, its power consumption might be even further reduced. Another technique for reducing the power consumption of the disk is to replace it with flash memory, as suggested by Douglis et al. <ref> [13] </ref>. They indicate that one such product can save 90% of hard drive power, even in the presence of disk power management. Given our figures, this would represent a total system power reduction for the Duo 280c of about 6.8%.

Reference-contexts: For example, most hard drives made for portable computers can be made to stop spinning in order to save power, and operating systems can take advantage of this by spinning down the hard drive when it is not in use. Li et al. <ref> [19] </ref> describe an aggressive strategy for doing just that to eliminate as much as 90% of hard drive power. Another low-power state that can be taken advantage of is running the CPU at a lower voltage. <p> Effect of different software techniques Our figures allow us to evaluate the effect of other power-saving techniques on total power consumption. For example, Li et al. <ref> [19] </ref> suggest a way to reduce total hard drive power consumption by 90%. Our studies show that the average Duo 280c user already saves about 60% of hard drive power. Furthermore, currently about 7.6% of total power is due to the hard drive. <p> [13] Used in Dell 320SLi 0.90 W [12] Used in Duo 230 0.96 W This paper Used in Zenith Mastersport SLe 1.00 W [12] IBM DB0A-2720 1.09 W fl [18] Used in Sharp PC 6785 1.10 W [16] Quantum Go*Drive 1.15 W fl [12] Maxtor MXL-105 III 1.15 W fl <ref> [19] </ref> Suggested for Intel386 system 1.20 W [14] Used in Toshiba T3300SL 1.20 W [12] Used in Duo 270c 1.22 W This paper Suggested for Am386 system 1.38 W fl [22] Used in Duo 280c 1.48 W This paper fl indicates a figure that we have inflated by 15% to account <p> The next part of our discussion demonstrates how power consumption could be further reduced by additional software techniques.

Reference-contexts: A few words should be said about power supply inefficiency. The power supply of a laptop computer taxes all power coming from the battery at a rate of about 15% <ref> [26] </ref>. In our breakdowns of power consumption, we could therefore say that the power supply consumes 15% of total power. However, we instead take the approach of attributing the power supply inefficiency to the components that use the power. <p> Power of motherboard components Since PowerMeasure cannot obtain power figures for machine states not currently supported, some data must be obtained through other means. To allow us to break down the power consumption of the motherboard, we obtained the following estimates from an engineer at Apple Computer <ref> [26] </ref>: * 68030 at 33 MHz consumes 1.15 W. * Duo 270c FPU, in typical operation, consumes 460 mW. * 68LC040 at 33 MHz consumes 3.33 W. * Power-management chip consumes 120 mW. * On interval duration is roughly 6600 clock cy cles. * Duo 230 display consumes 200 mW. *

Reference-contexts: CPU energy consumption per clock cycle is proportional to the square of the operating voltage. Since the number of clocks the CPU must run is invariant with the voltage, one can minimize CPU power consumption by minimizing CPU voltage. Weiser et al. <ref> [28] </ref> point out that in order to operate properly at a lower voltage, the clock rate must be simultaneously reduced. <p> Note, however, that if the voltage were reduced when CPU speed was reduced, as Weiser et al. <ref> [28] </ref> suggest, then we could expect larger power savings. We can compare these Duo results with those of the hypothetical Am386 DXL system described earlier, by taking into account MacDonald's estimates of the usage of low-power states of that machine [22]. <p> Of course, for different machines and for individual users these figures may be different; to get answers for such situations one must appropriately replace figures in the above calculation. Weiser et al. <ref> [28] </ref> indicate that if their algorithms are used to reduce CPU speed and voltage simultaneously, they can save as much as 50% or 70% of CPU power, depending on whether the minimum voltage available is 3.3 V or 2.2 V. <p> Thus, in this new scenario, it would be 13:5 MIPS 34:8 MIPS fi 0:41 W = 0:16 W: Thus, CPU power consumption would decrease 12 Type Description Power Source Processor 20 MHz 92010 Hobbit, 3.3 V 0.29 W fl [6] Motorola 68349 0.35 W fl <ref> [28] </ref> 20 MHz ARM610, 5 V 0.58 W fl [17] 25 MHz Intel486 SL 1.15 W fl [15] 33 MHz Motorola 68030 1.15 W This paper 33 MHz PA-RISC PA/50L 1.50 W fl [24] 33 MHz Am386 DXL 1.59 W fl [22] 40/80 MHz MIPS R4200 1.73 W fl [29] 50 <p> We find that aggressive spinning down of the hard disk, as suggested by Li et al.
