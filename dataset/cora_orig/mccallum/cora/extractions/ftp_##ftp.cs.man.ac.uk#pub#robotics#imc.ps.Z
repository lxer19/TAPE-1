Reference-contexts: A typical "AI"-type controller uses a model of the real world as its core component. Perception (i.e. sensory stimulus) directs a planning process centered around the internal world model, and leads to the selection of an action, which is subsequently executed. The Sense-Think-Act cycle then repeats (see, for instance, <ref> [Albus 91, Meystel 88] </ref>). This "vertical decomposition" of the control task, in which sensor signals enter the controller, percolate through perceptional, modelling, planning and exe-cutional modules to initiate motor action has received criticism, and alternative models of controller design have been proposed ([Brooks 85, Malcolm et al. 89].

Reference-contexts: Examples for behaviour-based robot controllers are the MIT robots ([Brooks 85, Brooks 86, Brooks et al. 88]), or the Edinburgh robots ([Malcolm & Smithers 88, Nehmzow 92], [Nehmzow et al. 93]); see as well <ref> [Arkin 87, Payton 86] </ref>.
