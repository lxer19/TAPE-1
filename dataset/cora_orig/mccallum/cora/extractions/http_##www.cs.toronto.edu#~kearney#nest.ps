Abstract: We investigate the class of NeST graphs, namely, the intersection tolerance graphs of neighborhood subtrees of a tree. We examine four subclasses of NeST graphs, present several class inclusion results and address the problem of recognition. In particular, we show the equivalence of proper NeST graphs and unit NeST graphs, the equivalence of fixed distance NeST graphs and threshold tolerance graphs, the proper containment of NeST graphs in weakly triangulated graphs and the NP-completeness of some problems related to NeST graph recognition.

Reference-contexts: Tolerance graphs contain not only interval graphs but also permutation graphs [GMT], threshold graphs and threshold tolerance graphs [MRT]. In 1993 Bibelnieks and Dearing generalized tolerance graphs to the class of Neighborhood Subtree Tolerance (NeST) graphs <ref> [BD] </ref>. NeST graphs generalize tolerance graphs by replacing neighborhoods of the line (i.e. intervals) with neighborhoods of an embedded tree. Generalizations of interval graphs obtained by replacing intervals of the line by subtrees of a tree have been studied before. <p> Generalizing subtree graphs by incorporating tolerances yields the class of subtree tolerance graphs. Hence, interval graphs are to tolerance graphs as sub-tree graphs are to subtree tolerance graphs. However, subtree tolerance graphs are uninteresting since they include all graphs <ref> [BD] </ref>. NeST graphs are obtained by the restriction that all subtrees in a subtree tolerance representation be neighborhoods of the tree. The concept of neighborhood subtrees of a tree has been studied before by Tamir in relation to network location problems [Tam]. graph classes discussed here. Fig. 1. <p> Fig. 1. NeST graphs and related classes of graphs. The top three classes of graphs are generalized by the bottom three classes of graphs by incorporating tolerances. 3 Bibelnieks and Dearing's showed that NeST graphs are weakly triangulated <ref> [BD] </ref>, namely, contain no induced cycle on five or more vertices in the graph or in its complement [Hay]. This result implies that NeST graphs are perfect, namely, have chromatic number equal to clique number for all induced subgraphs [BC]. <p> The first and third of these subclasses are new while the second and fourth were introduced in <ref> [BD] </ref>. Our investigation focuses on NeST representations, class inclusions and NeST recognition. Our main results are: The equivalence of fixed distance NeST graphs and threshold tolerance graphs. This responds to an open problem posed by Monma, Reed and Trotter [MRT]. <p> This equivalence leads to a succinct description of proper NeST graphs. The construction of a family of graphs which are weakly triangulated but not NeST demonstrating that NeST graphs are properly contained in weakly triangulated graphs. This responds to a question posed by Bibelnieks and Dearing <ref> [BD] </ref>. 4 The identification of several problems related to NeST recognition as being NP-complete. 2 Background and Definitions 2.1 Defining NeST Graphs We use standard graph theory terminology [BM]. All graphs are assumed to be simple and undirected. <p> Maximality is a desirable property since the diameter of a maximal neighborhood subtree T (c; r) is independent of T . Another desirable property is having all pairwise neighborhood subtree intersections nonempty. To this end, we state the following two assumptions; justifications for these assumptions can be found in <ref> [BD, K94] </ref>: 1. All neighborhood subtrees can be made maximal in a NeST representation. 2. All pairwise neighborhood subtree intersections can be made nonempty in a NeST representation. 2.3 The Role of Tolerances We now show how tolerances can be eliminated from a NeST representation. <p> Note that assumptions made in section 2.2 apply to fixed diameter and proper NeST representations. The following lemma yields a closed formula for neighborhood subtree intersection size: Lemma 5 <ref> [BD] </ref>. If T x 6 T y , T y 6 T x and T xy 6= ; then jT xy j = r x + r y d (c x ; c y ). Obviously a fixed diameter NeST representation is also a proper NeST representation. <p> This together with Theorem 15 implies polynomial recognition of fixed distance NeST graphs. 5 Fixed Tolerance NeST Graphs The final subclass of NeST graphs we examine is the class of fixed tolerance NeST graphs, introduced by Bibelnieks and Dearing and referred to by them as constant NeST graphs <ref> [BD] </ref>. Fixed tolerance NeST graphs have NeST representations in which all tolerances are equal. The relationship between fixed tolerance NeST graphs and NeST graphs is analogous to the relationship between interval graphs and tolerance graphs (see Figure 1). <p> Theorem 17 <ref> [BD] </ref>. The class of fixed tolerance NeST graphs is exactly the class of neighborhood subtree graphs. Theorem 18. <p> In particular, we show that NeST graphs are properly contained in weakly triangulated graphs. 18 6.1 NeST Graphs and Weakly Triangulated Graphs Bibelnieks and Dearing <ref> [BD] </ref> proved that NeST graphs are weakly triangulated. We show this inclusion to be proper by exhibiting a class of weakly triangulated graphs which are not NeST. Definition 20. <p> This extends a result of Bibelnieks and Dearing <ref> [BD] </ref>. 21 6.2 Threshold Graphs G is a threshold graph if there is an assignment w of positive weights to vertices of G, and a positive threshold t, such that xy 2 E if and only if w (x) + w (y) t.

Reference-contexts: This responds to an open problem posed by Monma, Reed and Trotter [MRT]. The equivalence of fixed diameter NeST graphs and proper NeST graphs. This extends an analogous property of interval graphs established by Roberts [Rob] but not shared by tolerance graphs <ref> [BILF] </ref>. This equivalence leads to a succinct description of proper NeST graphs. The construction of a family of graphs which are weakly triangulated but not NeST demonstrating that NeST graphs are properly contained in weakly triangulated graphs. <p> Roberts has shown that proper and unit interval graphs are equivalent [Rob]. On the other hand, unit tolerance graphs are strictly contained in proper tolerance graphs <ref> [BILF] </ref>. The natural question to ask is if unit and proper NeST graphs are equivalent which is settled in the affirmative by Theorem 6. 11 Theorem 6 also leads to a simplified description of proper NeST graphs.

Reference-contexts: It follows that graphs having a fixed tolerance and fixed distance NeST representation are 2K 2 , P 4 and C 4 -free. Finally, it is known that threshold graphs are exactly the 2K 2 , P 4 and C 4 -free graphs <ref> [CH] </ref>. 7 NeST Graph Recognition and Related Problems We turn our attention to the problem of determining when a graph is or is not a NeST graph or in a subclass of NeST graphs.

Reference-contexts: Despite difficulties in resolving the complexity of NeST graph recognition, the recognition problem motivates several interesting related problems. In this section we will survey several of these problems. The notion of time complexity used here is consistent with that found in <ref> [Gar] </ref>. We have seen how 2K 2 's in a proper NeST graph and conflicts in a fixed tolerance NeST graph impose structural constraints upon the corresponding proper phylogeny and fixed tolerance phylogeny. An initial step to recognition is the ability to realize constraints of this form by phylogenies.

This equivalence leads to a succinct description of proper NeST graphs. <p> Our main result shows that this subclass is equivalent to the class of threshold tolerance graphs introduced by Monma, Reed and Trotter <ref> [MRT] </ref>. A star is a tree in which a vertex, called the center, is adjacent to all vertices in the tree. An embedded star is an embedding of a star. The center of an embedded star is the point corresponding to the center of the associated star. Definition 9. <p> If G is a fixed distance NeST graph then G is a proper NeST graph. 2 Monma, Reed and Trotter asked whether threshold tolerance graphs can be characterized as intersection graphs of subtrees in a tree <ref> [MRT] </ref>. In response, we show that threshold tolerance graphs are exactly fixed distance NeST graphs, utilizing a theorem of Saks (see Theorem 2.5 in [MRT]), which can be restated as follows: Theorem 14. <p> is a proper NeST graph. 2 Monma, Reed and Trotter asked whether threshold tolerance graphs can be characterized as intersection graphs of subtrees in a tree <ref> [MRT] </ref>. In response, we show that threshold tolerance graphs are exactly fixed distance NeST graphs, utilizing a theorem of Saks (see Theorem 2.5 in [MRT]), which can be restated as follows: Theorem 14. A graph G = (V; E) is a threshold tolerance graph if and only if 15 there exists a total order &gt; of V such that xy 2 E , or Theorem 15. <p> G is a fixed distance NeST graph if and only if G is a threshold tolerance graph. Proof. By Saks' theorem, it follows that G is threshold tolerance if and only if G admits a radius-only representation. The theorem follows by Theorem 12. 2 In <ref> [MRT] </ref> a polynomial time recognition algorithm is presented for threshold tolerance graphs.

The NP-completeness of QN follows directly from the NP-completeness of QC. Hence, producing phylogenies that are consistent with arbitrary sets of constraints is a difficult problem.
