Abstract: On the Propagation of Errors in the Size of Join Results Abstract Query optimizers of current relational database systems use several statistics maintained by the system on the contents of the database to decide on the most efficient access plan for a given query. These statistics contain errors that transitively affect many estimates derived by the optimizer. We present a formal framework based on which the principles of this error propagation can be studied. Within this framework, we obtain several analytic results on how the error propagates in general, as well as in the extreme and average cases. We also provide results on guarantees that the database system can make based on the statistics that it maintains. Finally, we discuss some promising approaches to controlling the error propagation and derive several interesting properties of them.

Reference-contexts: In particular, we examine the case where the assumed join element distribution is uniform whereas the actual join element distribution is Zipf <ref> [Chr84, Zip49] </ref>. The main characteristic of the Zipf distribution is that it assigns high values to few join elements and low values to most join elements.

Reference-contexts: In hindsight, however, it becomes apparent that such an understanding is needed even for the currently common, low complexity queries, where errors can grow enough to cause erroneous decisions by the optimizers <ref> [Chr89, ML86a, ML86b, Sel89] </ref>. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces some notation for the study of error propagation and states the assumptions made in this paper. <p> Thresholds on the average error only bound the expected value of the error in the query result, but provide no guarantees for low errors in any specific case. Hence, we contend that, for individual join element errors, imposing thresholds on the maximum (and minimum) error is the correct approach <ref> [Chr89] </ref>. Similar comments can be made about the error in the query result as well. 3 By the definition of ffi j , this can also be written as 1 + a = Q N j .

Reference-contexts: The bounds obtained for individual join elements are the same with those obtained in Section 5, so they are not presented here as well. The following known inequalities from mathematics <ref> [Kaz64] </ref> are needed for obtaining the maxi mum value of D. Theorem 4.1 If 1 + x 0 and ff 1, then (1 + x) ff 1 + ffx.

Reference-contexts: We are aware of no work in the area of error propagation in the context of database query optimization. There is extensive literature on deriving good estimates for the parameters of the result of database operations, which has been surveyed by Mannino, Chu, and Sager <ref> [MCS88] </ref>. This is not the case, however, with the effect of the unavoidable errors in these estimates on the error of a sequence of such operations.
