Abstract: Autonomous and semi-autonomous full-sized ground vehicles are becoming increasingly important, particularly in military applications. Here we describe the instrumentation of one such vehicle, a 4-wheel drive Hummer, for autonomous robotic operation. Actuators for steering, brake, and throttle have been implemented on a commercially available Hummer. Control is provided by on-board and remote computation. On-board computation includes a PC-based control computer coupled to feedback sensors for the steering wheel, brake, and forward speed; and a Unix workstation for high-level control. A radio link connects the on-board computers to an operator's remote workstation running the Georgia Tech MissionLab system. The paper describes the design and implementation of this integrated hardware/software system that translates a remote human operator's commands into directed motion of the vehicle. Telerobotic control of the hummer has been demonstrated in outdoor experiments.
