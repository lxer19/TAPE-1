Title: ABSTRACT  
Abstract: We present an approach to interactive recovery from speech recognition errors in the context of spoken language applications, which is motivated from research in the field of linguistics on repair dialogues in human to human conversations. We propose a framework to compare error recovery methods, arguing that a rational user will prefer error recovery methods which provide an optimal trade off between accuracy, speed and naturalness. We conjecture to beat skilled typing in speed, we need real-time speech recognition technology which performs on a 90% word accuracy level. Finally, we describe how we augmented our JANUS speech to speech translation system with prototypical error recovery methods, and presents results from a preliminary evaluation.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Although intensive research over recent years has boosted the performance of speech recogni tion technology significantly, the automatic interpretation of speech is inherently unreliable - even human performance is limited <ref> [1] </ref>. We therefore argue that beyond improvements in baseline spo ken language interpretation technology, methods to gracefully recover from interpretation errors are needed to be able to design speech user interfaces which live up to their promise of improving usability. 2.

Reference-contexts: following three approaches to dealing with interpretation errors, some of which other researchers in the field have already addressed: Reduce the number of interpretation errors by inuencing the user towards speaking styles the automatic interpretation system can interpret more accurately. [4],[5] showed that training the user can improve recognition accuracy. <ref> [6] </ref> explored how to use the interface layout and the system prompts to guide the user towards natural lan guage queries which are easier to interpret. Facilitate the detection of interpretation errors through context sensitive feedback messages [7]. Repair interpretation errors by involving the user in interactive error recovery.

Reference-contexts: Apples vision of a Knowledge Navigator) Task, including dictation, (textual or visual) information retrieval and spoken language translation. In human to human conversations, people prefer strategies which minimize the effort both communication partners spend collectively <ref> [8] </ref>. Therefore we argue the rational user will prefer spoken language interfaces which minimize the effort spent to complete his task, collaboratively with the spoken language interface.

Reference-contexts: A PROTOTYPE INTERFACE WITH ERROR RECOVERY We developed prototypical interactive methods to recover from speech recognition errors. Currently, we have implemented these methods in the context of a multi-lingual speech-to-speech translation system in an appointment scheduling domain <ref> [10] </ref>. Repair is performed at the level of speech recognition. The user interacts with the system until he is satisfied with the paraphrase of his input. Thus an interaction turn consists of providing an initial utterance, followed by - depending on the number of recognition errors - multiple repair interactions. <p> It remains to be explored whether eliminating all buttons by having the system determine automatically the appropriate specialized recognizer improves the repair interaction. 5. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION Based on our most recent version of the JANUS speech translation system <ref> [10] </ref> we conducted a preliminary evaluation with 4 subjects. They had prior experience with speech recognition technology. In each session, two subjects were given fictitious calendars and were asked to schedule a meeting. Of a total of 57 turns, 39 needed repair.

Reference-contexts: We developed language modeling techniques which take advantage of the (correct) context of the reparandum to improve repair accuracy. Repair by spelling: The user spells out loud a sequence of letters, which is recognized by a specialized connected letter recognizer <ref> [11] </ref>. To achieve high accuracy, the words that are spelled can be constrained to some given vocabulary, e.g. the same as used by the continuous speech recognizer. Repair by selection among alternatives: A list of alternative hypotheses for the high lighted region is generated and displayed in a pop-up menu.

Reference-contexts: Repair by selection among alternatives: A list of alternative hypotheses for the high lighted region is generated and displayed in a pop-up menu. Repair by handwriting: The user provides cursive handwriting input, which is inter preted by another specialized recognizer <ref> [12] </ref>. Currently, each repair method has a button associated with it, and the user initiates repair by pressing the corresponding button. This approach makes the choice of modality explicit and thus avoids moding errors.
