Abstract: The variety of upcoming applications in terms of their performance and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements is increasing. Besides almost well-known applications, such as teleconferencing, audio- and video-transmissions, even more contemporary ones, such as medical imaging, Video-on-Demand, and interactive tutoring systems, are introduced and applied to existing networks. On the contrary, traditionally data-oriented applications, such as file transfer and remote login, are considerably different in terms of their QoS requirements. Therefore, the consequences of this evolution effect the architectures of end-systems, e.g., workstations that have to be capable of maintaining all different kinds of multi-media data, and intermediate-systems as well. Therefore, a configuration approach of communication protocols has been developed to support the variety of applications. This approach offers the possibility to configure communication protocols automatically depending on the application requirements expressed in various QoS parameters. The result, an application-tailored communication protocol, matches the requested application requirements as far as possible. Additionally, network and system resources (NSR) are taken into account for a well-suited configuration. fl The author is currently on leave from Universitat Karlsruhe, Institut fur Telematik, D-76128 Karlsruhe, Germany, and is sponsored by the Commission of the European Communities as a Research Fellow under the Human Capital and Mobility Scheme (RG 19327). This work has been performed in Karlsruhe within the Cooperation between the Universitat Karlsruhe, Institut fur Telematik and Siemens AG, ZFE Munchen, except for the final testing and evaluation phase, which has been done remotely distributed between Karlsruhe and Cambridge. The generation of this Final Report took place in Cambridge as well, which includes besides new results and details on the prototypical implementation of CogPiT, updated versions of former reports number 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [28], or the VMTP [17] offer a well-defined set of protocol functionality. Again, the inherent flexibility of these protocols is limited, since they do offer a specific service only. An exception in this sense is the XTP <ref> [9] </ref> protocol, where an application might request some choices for certain protocol functions, such as the flow control for rate-based or window-based mechanisms. The consequence is that the fine-grained granularity of configurable building-blocks can be reached by protocol functions and mechanisms only.

Based on the current situation of resource parameters and the evaluated conditions, protocol functions and mechanisms are selected and added to the sender as well as to the receiver protocol machine respectively <ref> [21] </ref>. TIP-specific Configuration Tasks and Prerequisites | In the TIP environment the configuration task remains principally the same as within PROCOM except for the following enhancements due to TIP: * Introduction of additional TIP-specific configuration information. * Separation of successor/predecessor information for mechanisms. <p> Subsection all relevant issues of MDL and its important prerequisites are generally discussed and, furthermore, explained with several examples. 4.5.1 Targets of MDL The Module Description Language (MDL) has been derived and especially tailored for the CogPiT-project with regard to the TIP-environment from the language F-PCL (Function-based Protocol Configuration Language) <ref> [21] </ref>. MDL in the entire Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) has been added in Appendix C. A formal language is necessary to define entirely configuration information for considered modules uniquely. <p> Furthermore, the maintenance of the pool of module and the worldgraph by a protocol resource manager for configuration purposes are presented in concept. Finally, a principal manner of negotiating QoS parameters of channel configurations within multicast scenarios is discussed. 5 This problem has been avoided within the F-PCL language <ref> [21] </ref>, while including an additional CODE attribute per mechanism body, to identify the valid module's name of the implementation, which is completely independent of the naming conventions used within the formal language itself and follows a more strict separation of specification and implementation of mechanisms. 22 5.1 The Configuration Algorithm COFAL <p> Therefore, important aspects are explained briefly throughout this Paragraph, while further 35 information and details may be retrieved from <ref> [21] </ref> or the corresponding source code files. Based on 8 steps, as described in Paragraph 5.1.2, the implementation followed a straight forward approach. <p> This allows for a quite efficient manner of handling complex expressions. Obviously, step 4 includes the crucial part of selecting relevant protocol functions and mechanisms for the configured communication protocol. A detailed flow chart for all corresponding evaluation and selection steps can be found in <ref> [21] </ref> on page 97. After this selection procedure the used worldgraph lacks on purpose some entries in terms of "missing" mechanisms | these are the non-selected mechanisms. But still, some selected mechanism may have successor or predecessor information pointing to these non-selected mechanisms. <p> This concept is not limited to a special hardware-environment, but it needs detailed information on the hardware-environment. The developed configuration process is efficient as the initial performance evaluations show (compare results on a different platform as well <ref> [21] </ref>), since the formal restrictions on the resource pool have been kept small and short. Furthermore, a straight forward configuration algorithm is based on these pre-conditions.

Certain extensions in TIS have to be introduced, since some necessary information are missing in TIS but they are indispensably needed in MDL.
