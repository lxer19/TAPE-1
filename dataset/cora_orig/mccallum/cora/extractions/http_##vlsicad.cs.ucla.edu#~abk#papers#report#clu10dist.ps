Abstract: This paper describes ongoing studies of clustering objectives and heuristics, along with their effect on top-down partitioning based standard-cell placement. Clustering for placement has three main facets the objective, the heuristic, and the benefits but the connections among these facets have never been clarified. Our studies represent the first steps toward reconciling these three facets. Specifically: (1) we consider seven distinct objectives (three from the literature, four new), by which we can rank given clustering heuristics; (2) we consider 35 variants of 13 clustering heuristics (four from the literature, nine new); (3) we evaluate the benefits of given clusterings using a recent top-down partitioning based placement tool [HK97] whose approach and solution quality reflect those of leading-edge tools (e.g., quadratic top-down placers); and (4) based on these steps, we identify (new) objectives and heuristics that seem most beneficial to placement. Our paper concludes by discussing some limitations and near-term extensions to the present study.

Reference-contexts: In our work, we study clustering for placement in terms of three elements: the clustering objective, the clustering heuristic, and the perceived benefit to placement. * The Clustering Objective. The true definition of a good clustering is "one that leads to better placement solution quality". As noted in <ref> [AK94] </ref>, this is a meta-objective, e.g., one can replace "placement" by "two-phase FM partitioning" in the definition (see also comments by Soukup regarding placement objectives [Sou81]); it cannot be optimized by traditional methods. <p> We also review heuristics that have been claimed to improve two-phase FM bipartitioning (matching-based [BCLS87] 1 We are not yet satisfied with the rigor of the "deduction process" that leads to our new criteria, and our new criteria in general are not optimizable. 2 [BHJL89] and Scaled Cost based WINDOW <ref> [AK94] </ref>). We then describe several new clustering heuristics, including three variants of MFFC clustering (MFFC-LA, IMFFC, IMFFC-LA) and six others that we call Alg1, Alg2, Alg3, Alg4, Alg5 and Alg6. <p> Many clustering heuristics have been described in the literature without any associated objective; these are discussed in Section 4. 4 This is a k-way generalization of the ratio cut objective, and has been optimized in other works, e.g., the Window clustering approach of Alpert and Kahng <ref> [AK94] </ref>. * DS Ratio.

Reference-contexts: Since leading-edge (global) placers are based on top-down partitioning, certain partitioning objectives arguably have connections to placement; such objectives include D/S ratio [HK92] and Scaled Cost [CSZ93] (see <ref> [AK95] </ref> for a survey). Our eventual goal is to deduce a clustering objective (i.e., an analytic quality measure of a given clustering) from a realistic model of (top-down) cell placement. Such an objective should be efficiently optimizable, and lead to clusterings that consistently improve the placement solution quality. <p> We call v the root of Cone v , i.e., v = root (Cone v ). 2 Clustering Objectives We have studied seven clustering objectives. Three of these, Scaled Cost, DS Ratio and Absorption, are well known in the literature <ref> [AK95] </ref>. 2 * Scaled Cost. To integrate cutsize and cluster size balance within a single objective, Chan et al. [CSZ93] proposed the Scaled Cost objective for multi-way netlist partitioning.

Reference-contexts: Netlist clustering heuristics are usually classified as either top-down or bottom-up. A top-down heuristic recursively partitions the netlist into subclusters, e.g., using a ratio-cut objective [WC91]. A bottom-up heuristic initially assigns each cell to its own cluster and agglomeratively merges clusters into larger clusters, e.g., by random matching <ref> [BCLS87] </ref> [BHJL89]. <p> We also review heuristics that have been claimed to improve two-phase FM bipartitioning (matching-based <ref> [BCLS87] </ref> 1 We are not yet satisfied with the rigor of the "deduction process" that leads to our new criteria, and our new criteria in general are not optimizable. 2 [BHJL89] and Scaled Cost based WINDOW [AK94]). <p> A matching in the netlist is a set of disjoint pairs of cells, such that each pair shares a common net.

Reference-contexts: Third, clustering can incorporate knowledge of problem structure that the placer would otherwise have to ignore (e.g., recognition of synthesized buffer-inverter trees, recognition of two-dimensional regularity [NJ96], "electrical clustering", or hierarchy-based clustering <ref> [BHB96] </ref>); we believe that this will be the key motivation for clustering in the future. In our work, we study clustering for placement in terms of three elements: the clustering objective, the clustering heuristic, and the perceived benefit to placement. * The Clustering Objective. <p> Finally, recall that traditional placement and clustering formulations rely mostly on netlist topology and ignore many pieces of design information, such as hierarchy naming, bus names, functional information about cells, etc. Following recent works (e.g., [NJ96] <ref> [BHB96] </ref>) we are exploring methods that incorporate such information into the heuristic clustering.

Reference-contexts: Our study avoids true top-down heuristics because of their complexity, and because they are largly subsumed by our placement testbed (the QUAD placer of [HK97]). All other clustering heuristics are considered. In Section 3, we review clustering heuristics that have been claimed to improve placement performance including MFFC-based <ref> [CX95] </ref>, annealing for maximum Absorption [SS93], and regularity extraction [NJ96]; we subsume the cone-based approach of [TL95] by an MFFC variant. <p> Cong and Ding [CD93] find maximum "fanout-free cones" (single-output subnetworks), or MFFCs, in the DAG of a combinational network; they apply this decomposition to FPGA technology mapping. 9 Figure 1 shows the MFFC decomposition of a small combinational network. A modified MFFC decomposition <ref> [CX95] </ref> handles circuits with sequential elements, as follows. (1) Given a circuit H (V; E), assign to a set Q all POs and all cells that fanin to sequential cells. (2) Choose an arbitrary cell v 2 Q, and initialize the MFFC whose output is v, M F F C v <p> Our MFFC decomposition implementation is similar to that of <ref> [CX95] </ref>. The main difficulty with MFFC decomposition is that some MFFCs can be very large; this can be addressed in two ways. (1) We may perform MFFC splitting after a large MFFC is formed. Given an MFFC M , let root (M ) be the root cell of M . <p> The procedure is repeated until all cells have been clustered. This is followed by macro-cell placement using TimberWolfMC [Sec91] and then the placement is fed to TimberWolf6.0 as its initial placement. * MFFC-TW. Cong and Xu <ref> [CX95] </ref> use the MFFC decomposition and a "containment tree" heuristic that splits large MFFCs into smaller ones, to obtain clusters with restricted sizes.

Reference-contexts: The true definition of a good clustering is "one that leads to better placement solution quality". As noted in [AK94], this is a meta-objective, e.g., one can replace "placement" by "two-phase FM partitioning" in the definition (see also comments by Soukup regarding placement objectives <ref> [Sou81] </ref>); it cannot be optimized by traditional methods. The key question is whether a good clustering objective, optimizable by traditional methods, can be deduced from knowledge of the placer that uses the clustering.

Reference-contexts: TimberWolf7.0 <ref> [SS95] </ref> applies a hierarchical placement methodology (see Figure 3) that combines clustering based on the Absorption objective and simulated annealing (SA). The original netlist is hierarchically clustered into two coarser-grain levels of netlists, then SA is used to place these levels of netlists.

Reference-contexts: We also analyzed placements from the commercial TimberWolf placer <ref> [Swa96] </ref>, and from the GORDIAN-L/DOMINO and SPEED placers [Rie95], as reported in Section 4. 6 * The C Objective.

Reference-contexts: All other clustering heuristics are considered. In Section 3, we review clustering heuristics that have been claimed to improve placement performance including MFFC-based [CX95], annealing for maximum Absorption [SS93], and regularity extraction [NJ96]; we subsume the cone-based approach of <ref> [TL95] </ref> by an MFFC variant. <p> The second-level netlist is then placed using medium temperature, then decomposed back to the original netlist, and low temperature SA is applied. * Cone-Based Placement. Tsay and Lin <ref> [TL95] </ref> extract cone-based clusters based on structural properties of the circuit, then perform a macro-cell placement treating each cone as a soft macro. The resulting macro-cell placement is then mapped into a row-based placement, and simulated annealing is used to refine the placement result.
