Abstract: Inferences in measurement error models can be sensitive to modeling assumptions. Specifically, if the model is incorrect then the estimates can be inconsistent. To reduce sensitivity to modeling assumptions and yet still retain the efficiency of parametric inference we propose to use flexible parametric models which can accommodate departures from standard parametric models. We use mixtures of normals for this purpose. We study two cases in detail: a linear errors-in-variables model and a change-point Berkson model. fl Raymond J.

Reference-contexts: This need not be the case for all situations, however. In the standard linear model, when data are missing by a process that depends upon the surrogate response, the validity of the maximum likelihood estimator depends upon the validity of the parametric assumptions made <ref> (Carroll, Freedman and Pee, 1996) </ref>. Two solutions to this sensitivity to assumptions suggest themselves. One solution is to take a semiparametric approach (e.g. Rotnitzky and Robbins, 1995), but this can be challenging to implement. For instance, in one of our examples, a change-point problem, no consistent semiparametric estimator is known. <p> Furthermore, while semiparametric approaches have the virtue of being more model robust, they can lead to a considerable loss in efficiency relative to a parametric model if the parametric model is approximately correct. This loss of efficiency can be substantial even for moderate to large sample sizes <ref> (e.g., Carroll et al. 1996) </ref>. The other solution is to use a parametric model which is extremely flexible for at least some of the important components in the problem. In this article we take the second tact, using normal mixture models (section 2) as the flexible model.

Reference-contexts: Unlike in the linear regression case, where the Berkson model leads to unbiased estimates, in the change-point problem there is a profound bias due to measurement error of Berkson type <ref> (See, for e.g., Carroll et al. 1995, pp156-160) </ref>. Here we consider a normal mixture model for the measurement error distribution. 4.1 Motivation and Model This problem is motivated by the Munich-bronchitis dataset which is discussed in Carroll et al. (1995, pp 156-160). <p> Increasing k beyond 3 leads to unstable estimates of (fl; fi 2 ) with very high variances. These data have a fairly subtle signal <ref> (see Figure 7.3, Carroll et al. 1995, p 157) </ref> hence we would not expect to be able to estimate any of the parameters of the model with high reliability, including a complex distribution for U .

Reference-contexts: Mixtures of normals are a particularly convenient choice for a flexible parametric family. We should add that it is also possible to use infinite mixtures of normals <ref> (Escobar and West, 1995) </ref>. These are similar to the models we used and lead to very similar inferences. 13 Appendix A: Linear Errors-in-Variables Model Complete conditional distributions.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction It is typical in errors-in-variables models to assume that the measurement error and the latent variable are normally distributed, and many modeling situations are robust to this assumption <ref> (Fuller, 1987, Carroll, Ruppert and Stefanski, 1995) </ref>. In the standard linear errors-in-variables problem, for instance, normal theory likelihood analysis gives consistent estimates for any distribution. This need not be the case for all situations, however. <p> All random variables are uncorrelated. If m f = 1, then the measurement error variance 2 u cannot be estimated, and it well known that fi 1 cannot then be estimated <ref> (Fuller, 1987) </ref>. 3.2 Standard Methods If the measurement error model formulation has no missing data then this is the classical linear measurement error model covered by Fuller (1987).

Reference-contexts: With missing data, for the method of moments, Carroll et al. (1996) use only the validation data and weight it inversely with the selection probabilities, i.e., the well-known Horvitz-Thompson method. As is well-known <ref> (Little and Rubin, 1987) </ref>, the maximum like lihood estimator does not take into account the selection probabilities. With missing data, the moments estimate is still consistent and asymptotically normal even without assuming normality.
