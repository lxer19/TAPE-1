Abstract: Measured Equation of Invariance (MEI) is a new concept in computational electromagnetics. It has been demonstrated that the MEI technique can be used to terminate the meshes very close to the object boundary and still strictly preserves the sparsity of the FD equations. Therefore, the final system matrix encountered by MEI is a sparse matrix with size similar to that of integral equation methods. However, complicated Green's function, disagreeable Sommerfeld integrals, and very difficult umbilical meshes for multiconductors make the traditional MEI very difficult, if not impossible, to be applied to analyze multilayer and mul-ticonductor interconnects. In this paper, we propose the Geometry Independent MEI (GIMEI) which substantially improved the original MEI method. We use GIMEI for capacitance extraction of general two-dimension and three-dimension VLSI interconnect. Numerical results are in good agreement with published data and those obtained by using FASTCAP from MIT and some other commercial tools, while GIMEI are generally an order of magnitude faster than FASTCAP with much less memory usage.
