Abstract: This paper describes a method for escrowing cryptographic keys, which we call Failsafe Key Escrow (FKE). The method is substantially more secure than alternatives such as the Fair Public Key Cryptosystem approach advocated by Micali, and it is particularly well suited for use in escrowing DSS keys.

Reference-contexts: Such activity might take place even if the PKC were established solely for the purposes of 2 digital signatures since the criminals might use the PKC for other purposes such as encryption. This problem has been addressed in a series of papers. Blakley <ref> [1] </ref> and Shamir [6] describe methods wherein the secret cryptographic key of each user is shared among one or more trustees. (Trustees are presumably few in number and are highly trusted entities.) In particular, each trustee is given a secret piece of the secret key for each user.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, when the trustees reveal their shares under a court order (say), the shares may be found to be useless because the criminal user did not provide proper shares of his or her secret key. This problem is resolved in <ref> [2] </ref>, where it is shown how shares can be provided in a way so that each trustee can be assured that he or she has received a valid share of the secret key.

Reference-contexts: The new method is substantially more secure than the Fair Public-Key Cryptosystem (FPKC) approach advocated by Micali [5]. This is because the FPKC approach does not satisfy Properties 2 and 5. In particular, Killian <ref> [3] </ref> has recently shown how the public keys stored in Micali's FPKC escrow scheme can be used by criminals to communicate (using 1 a published public key cryptosystem (PKC)) in a way that the Government will not be able to decipher, even if the secret keys for the users are provided

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the central authority may have no hope of discovering S 0 X . This problem can be resolved by having the trustees themselves select the pair of keys for each user, as suggested in <ref> [4] </ref>. But schemes in which the trustees select the secret key for each user may leave the user with no assurance that his key has been properly generated (so as to be secure). Such a scheme would not satisfy Property 1.

This is because the FPKC approach does not satisfy Properties 2 and 5. <p> A secret sharing scheme in which each trustee can be assured that he or she has a valid share of a secret is known as a Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. Many such schemes are known in the literature. In <ref> [5] </ref>, Micali claims that a VSS scheme used in this fashion forms what he calls a Fair Public-Key Cryptosystem. Although the precise definition of a Fair PKC is not provided, Micali states that a key property of a Fair PKC is that it "cannot be misused by criminal organizations" [5]. <p> In <ref> [5] </ref>, Micali claims that a VSS scheme used in this fashion forms what he calls a Fair Public-Key Cryptosystem. Although the precise definition of a Fair PKC is not provided, Micali states that a key property of a Fair PKC is that it "cannot be misused by criminal organizations" [5]. As demonstrated by the Killian attack, however, it is clear that the Micali method for Fair PKCs can be seriously misused by 3 criminals.

Reference-contexts: Second, any set of h &gt; k trustees should be able to recover the secret key of a user by pooling their shares of that key. Many such "secret sharing" schemes are known in the literature (e.g., see the survey paper by Simmons <ref> [7] </ref>).
