Title: A Novel Framework for Decentralized Supervisory Control with Communication

Abstract: The decentralized control problem that we address in this paper is that of several communicating supervisory controllers, each with different information, working in concert to exactly achieve a given legal sublanguage of the uncontrolled system's language model. We present a novel information structure formalism for dealing with this class of problems. Preliminary results are presented which elucidate a fundamental concept in decentralized control problems: the importance of controllers anticipating future possible communications.

Reference-contexts: We will denote the closed-loop language of the plant, G, under control of the set of supervisors, Z, by L (Z=G). Following a trace s 2 L (Z=G) the unprocessed data available to a controller i 2 Z for making a decision is represented by an extended trace <ref> [1] </ref> of the form: t k = 1 Y ffi j;i # i " j2Z 2 : : : k Y ffi j;i # i where i 2 o;i [ f*g (* denotes the empty trace), ffi j;i is a set of symbols communicated from Controller j to Con troller i,

Reference-contexts: Theorem 3.1 implies that Problem (P) has a solution iff the desired language L (H) can be implemented by a centralized supervisor. The proof of Theorem 3.1 (see <ref> [2] </ref>) utilizes the construction of a finite estimator structure and inference maps that utilize the existence of future communications from other controllers along certain trajectories in the system. Memory of prior communications is captured by the state-update rule for the estimator structure.
