Abstract: We describe an approach to transport QoS in unreliable networks that focuses on tradeoffs rather than guarantees. In particular, we investigate tradeoffs between qualitative QoS parameters such as order and reliability, and quantitative parameters such as delay and throughput.

Reference-contexts: so far include analytic and simulation results characterizing the QoS tradeoffs offered by PO/PR service (Section 3) and the development of software components for experimentation with PO/PR service (Section 4). 3 ANALYSIS AND SIMULATION Analytic and simulation work has yielded several important results about partially reliable and partially ordered services <ref> (Marasli 1997) </ref>. The key results related to partially ordered service are: (1) PO service provides buffer utilization and delay improvements over ordered service, particularly as the loss rate increases, or as the order requirements of applications decrease.

Reference-contexts: The key results related to partially reliable service are: (1) for lossy networks, using a reliable transport service when only a partially reliable service is needed can cause considerable worsening in throughput and delay <ref> (Marasli, Amer & Conrad 1996b) </ref>; (2) both sender-based and receiver-based reliability schemes for providing partial reliability achieve almost identical reliability and delay. On the other hand, a sender-based approach provides better throughput than a receiver-based approach at higher ack loss rates (Marasli, Amer & Conrad 1997a).

Reference-contexts: Order, however, makes no difference to throughput, as long as the transport sender buffer size is less than or equal to the transport receiver buffer size <ref> (Marasli, Amer & Conrad 1997b) </ref>; (2) by carefully choosing the transmission order of independent objects (linear extension selection), additional buffer utilization and delay improvements can be obtained (Marasli et al. 1997b, Marasli, Amer & Conrad 1996a). <p> no difference to throughput, as long as the transport sender buffer size is less than or equal to the transport receiver buffer size (Marasli, Amer & Conrad 1997b); (2) by carefully choosing the transmission order of independent objects (linear extension selection), additional buffer utilization and delay improvements can be obtained <ref> (Marasli et al. 1997b, Marasli, Amer & Conrad 1996a) </ref>.
