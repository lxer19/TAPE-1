Abstract: Text categorization is the task of classifying text into one of several predefined categories. In this paper we will evaluate the effectiveness of several ILP methods for text categorization, and also compare them to their propositional analogs. The methods considered are FOIL, the propositional rule-learning system RIPPER, and a first-order version of RIPPER called FLIPPER. We show that the benefit of using a first-order representation in this domain is relatively modest; in particular, the performance difference between FLIPPER and FOIL and their propositional counterparts is quite small, compared to the differences between FOIL and FLIPPER. However, a first-order representation seems to be advantageous when high-precision classifiers are desirable.
