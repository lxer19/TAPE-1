Reference-contexts: Marians' [39] definition is less restrictive and more inclusive: a ring in a network is primitive if at least one of the two paths between any pair of nodes of the ring is a minimal path.

(They define as a ring what we call a primitive ring, and a cycle to be what we call, in general, a ring.) The formal definition adopted for a primitive ring is constructive in that it yields

Amorphous silica networks can, for example, result from quenching the liquid, irradiating crystalline polymorphs, oxidizing silicon, depositing from a vapor, or dehydrating gels; the resulting structures are distinct [53] and depend on their modes of formation.

Reference-contexts: Vertex-sharing tetrahedral silicas comprise [4,2]-connected networks in which the tetrahedral polytopes may be represented as network nodes; a connection between two nodes exists if the corresponding tetrahedra share vertices. The real network of tetrahedra and its nodal representation then possess isomorphic topologies. Crystalline networks are topologically ordered <ref> [22, 33] </ref>, possessing long-range orientational and translational order, which may be described in the symmetry-based language of crystallography. Aperiodic networks, though possibly possessing very similar connectivities, are topologically disordered and cannot be described by symmetry operations.

Reference-contexts: Such rings have been called minimal rings by Guttman <ref> [23] </ref>. Marians' [39] definition is less restrictive and more inclusive: a ring in a network is primitive if at least one of the two paths between any pair of nodes of the ring is a minimal path.

There are two topologically inequivalent tetrahedron sites and four distinct tetrahedron orientations, but we have chosen to assemble the structure with six types in the rules file (Figure 8) to render the conceptualization easier.

Reference-contexts: Aperiodic networks, though possibly possessing very similar connectivities, are topologically disordered and cannot be described by symmetry operations. Alternative descriptions of both periodic and aperiodic networks are possible using the topological properties which derive from their connectivities <ref> [30] </ref>. A full topological description requires a complete tessellation, several of which have been explored [3, 63, 10, 14, 56], but an incomplete tessellation of tetrahedral networks based on one-dimensional rings nearly suffices and has been shown to differentiate the crystalline polymorphs [43]. <p> The set of tetrahedra (or nodes) associated with the set of primitive rings passing through a given tetrahedron (or node) we refer to as the local cluster <ref> [42, 30] </ref>.

Coesite's much higher density is thus largely a consequence of the presence of much larger primitive rings.

Keatite is unique among compact crystalline silica polymorphs in that it is composed of odd-size rings.

Also, whereas quartz forms 3-fold and 6-fold spirals, keatite makes 4-fold spirals. Like moganite and coesite, there are two topologically-inequivalent tetrahedra, which we have chosen to model with three types in the assembly rules file (Figure 10). 200 nodes of the assembled structure are shown in Figure 11.
