Reference-contexts: make up Virtue, how to use them to create visualizations of your own, and the ways one can interact with the virtual environment. 1.1 Motivation One of the main research initiatives of the Pablo group at the University of Illinois has been the development of performance data analysis tools (see <ref> [1] </ref>). This work has focussed on gathering and examining data from the realm of high-performance computing. This is a domain that typically produces large data sets containing high dimensional, heterogeneous information. In several previous projects, data visualization has proven very beneficial in deciphering how these complex systems behave.

Reference-contexts: Visualization gives a broader view of a system than is afforded by a more focused statistical approach. It makes presentation of research results accessible to people who are not experts in a particular problem domain. While our previous Avatar virtual reality system (described in <ref> [2] </ref>, [3], and [4]) realized all of these benefits, it also pointed out to us some shortcomings in the current state of the art for abstract data visualization. To begin with, the tools did not truly allow for collaboration. <p> The scaling factor specifies the constant floating point multiplier that is applied to the data. Here is an example of a scaling object that multiplies a numeric datum by a factor of 1/1024 converting from bytes to Kilobytes: "linear factor scaling"- <ref> [2] </ref>- -, -;; 3.2.5.2 Logarithmic Scaling The Logarithmic Scaling record is employed when you want to switch to a logarithmic scale. This can be useful when you wish to look at variations in orders of magnitude within the data. <p> Here is an example of a scaling object that maps values from the domain [5, 17] to the range [0, 20.25], clamping without keeping a running max/min: "linear scaling"- <ref> [2] </ref>- -, F, 17, 20.25 "linear scaling"- //"Name" "Identifier for this structure" char "filter name"[]; // "clamp" "T indicates outliers clamped to range , F does not" char "clamp"; // "running" "T indicates min and max updated at runtime , F does not" char "running"; // "Min" "Minimum domain value "

Reference-contexts: Visualization gives a broader view of a system than is afforded by a more focused statistical approach. It makes presentation of research results accessible to people who are not experts in a particular problem domain. While our previous Avatar virtual reality system (described in [2], <ref> [3] </ref>, and [4]) realized all of these benefits, it also pointed out to us some shortcomings in the current state of the art for abstract data visualization. To begin with, the tools did not truly allow for collaboration. <p> The characters 10 imply use of base ten, while e implies a natural logarithm. Currently, these are the only two bases available, but they suffice for a great many situations. Here is a simple scaling object that takes the logarithm, base 10, of a numeric datum: "logarithmic scaling"- <ref> [3] </ref>- -, "10" -;; 3.2.5.3 Linear Scaling The most sophisticated scaling mechanism provided by Virtue is the Linear Scaling structure. This structure allows you to map numeric data lying in a given interval [a,b] to points along a second interval [c,d]. <p> For the color map, we assume there are only three possible owners with ID numbers 1, 2, and 3. We map these, using a direct mapping, to the colors red, blue, and purple respectively. The following record accomplishes this: "color map" - [13]- "OwnerColorMap" -, <ref> [3] </ref>- 2, -, - "BLUE", "PURPLE" - Since the default mapping function for size would map a byte to approximately a foot of virtual space, we a want to scale the size field down. We choose a multiplicative factor that maps 10 Megabytes to a single unit of virtual space.

Reference-contexts: This is an extremely flexible data meta-format that allows one to define the type and structure of data, typically attribute-value pairs as well as vector data. It is recommended that you read through the Pablo SDDF User Manual <ref> [5] </ref>, available from the Pablo web site. It provides a fast but thorough introduction to the format.

Reference-contexts: The problem of occlusion can be resolved by rotating the graph, either interactively or automatically, using the techniques described in Section 4 of this manual. For more information on cone trees and their uses, consult the paper by Robertson, et al. <ref> [7] </ref>. The Cone Tree Layout contains two parameters: The field called depth specifies the distance, as a floating-point value, from parent to child along the y-axis of the graph. The larger this value, the taller the cones in the graph.

Reference-contexts: A box with a dashed outline represents a process or group of processes running on a machine. Arrows indicate information being sent to an entity. Solid arrows that run between machines represent a TCP/IP network connection. A more detailed depiction is available in The Multimedia Toolbox Guide <ref> [8] </ref>. When running on a workstation, it is most likely that you will want to use simulator mode. This allows you to use the keyboard and a 2-D mouse to interact with the virtual environment. See the CAVE Users Manual [9] for more details on how to accomplish this. <p> If you plan on using the annotation and remote collaboration features of Virtue, you need to have this file in your home directory as well. The .mmrc file is described in depth in The Multimedia Toolbox Guide <ref> [8] </ref>, and a sample file is included in the Multimedia Toolbox distribution. 2.3.4 The PanTilt Camera Resource File If you will be using a Directed Perceptions PanTilt Unit camera platform to train a video camera on a user in the virtual environment, you will need to create a resource file for <p> Unless you plan to add new Audio Actors, you will never need to edit this file. For more information on this file, refer to the VSS documentation at http://cage.ncsa.uiuc.edu/adg/VSS/traning.html. 2.4 Using the Multimedia Tools While a complete description of the multimedia tools is available in The Multimedia Toolbox Guide <ref> [8] </ref> (which is recommended reading), we present a brief summary of the tools here. The multimedia tools are a set of processes that manipulate RTP streams in specific ways. Each one of the processes described below must be running somewhere for Virtue to have full annotation and collaboration functionality.

Reference-contexts: This system interfaces with Virtue and provides information about user location. The type of tracker used will be somewhat dependent on the projection system you select. The CAVE User Manual <ref> [9] </ref> includes a list of supported trackers under the section that describes the CAVE configuration file. Some common ones include the Ascension Flock of Birds, the Spacepad system that is ad with the ImmersaDesk, the Logitech Sonic Tracker, or one of several available units from Polhemus Inc. <p> When running on a workstation, it is most likely that you will want to use simulator mode. This allows you to use the keyboard and a 2-D mouse to interact with the virtual environment. See the CAVE Users Manual <ref> [9] </ref> for more details on how to accomplish this. <p> Before running Virtue, you need to create a valid .caverc file in your home directory. You should consult the CAVE Users Guide for CAVE Library Version 2.6 <ref> [9] </ref> for details on how to do this. It provides extensive documentation on how to create such a file. One of the lines of the .caverc file should be SoundServer xxx, where xxx is the name of the machine hosting the Sound Server. <p> As with the explicit layout we saw earlier, a graph with this layout will initially appear as having red spherical vertices, and yellow cylindrical edges. All the components will start off being completely opaque, and the vertices will have unit size. random layout - <ref> [9] </ref> -Unit cube, [7]-DEFAULT-, "random layout"- // Name Identifier for this structure char "layout name"[ ]; // Node shape Initial shape of vertices char "vertex shape"[ ]; // Node color Initial vertex color char "vertex color"[ ]; // Link shape Initial edge shape char "edge shape"[ ]; // Link color Initial <p> These are specified in generic units. The actual type of units (e.g. feet) that are used within the virtual environment is a function of the CAVE configuration file (.caverc) that is being used. Please see the CAVE Users Guide <ref> [9] </ref> for details. 53 Shape Identifier Dimensions Appearance LINE The length (z-axis) is 1.0 units. The width (x-axis) and height (y-axis) respectively are both 0.01 units CYLINDER The cylinder has a height (y-axis) of 1.0 units The radius is 0.2 units. <p> This Instance, which we call FileGraph, will not be used as a subgraph of another Instance. The record looks like this: "graph instance"- <ref> [9] </ref>- "FileGraph" -, "FILE" -, "cone" -, 0.0, -2.0, 0.0, 1.0, [4]- "NONE" -, 62 Now, it is time to decide how to alter the visual attributes of the graph as data is read. We will use a Data Map record to specify this. <p> We use the following Association record to do this: "association"- <ref> [9] </ref>- "FileGraph" -, "FileSystemVis" - The data for the visualization run should be appended to the file at this point. <p> A CAVE system will begin with the origin in the middle of the floor. Running on a workstation in simulator mode, the window will show the environment from a viewpoint specified in the .caverc file. Consult the CAVE Users Guide <ref> [9] </ref> for details. In any case, its likely that your initial view of the environment will be from a viewpoint roughly near the origin and facing down the z-axis. The type of unit used to specify size in the visualization, while configurable, is usually feet.
