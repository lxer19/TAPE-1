Abstract: Experimental results Abstract The surface detectors to be used for the next generation giant air shower array (Auger Project) are water Cherenkov detectors. To operate the large number of widely spaced units remote calibration and monitoring is necessary. It has been suggested that for this purpose the background flux of muons might be used. This work demonstrates the practicality of such an approach.

Reference-contexts: This is more cost effective and also implies higher reliability since the complexity of the detector system is reduced. 2 Experimental setup This work is based on measurements, carried out at the water Cherenkov prototype detector <ref> [1] </ref> located at the south east corner of the Akeno Giant Air Shower Array (AGASA) [2]. The main detector component is a cylindrically shaped PVC bag [1], with radius 1.8 m and a depth of 1.2 m. The inner surface is lined with a highly reflective ( 90%) Tyvek sheet. <p> complexity of the detector system is reduced. 2 Experimental setup This work is based on measurements, carried out at the water Cherenkov prototype detector <ref> [1] </ref> located at the south east corner of the Akeno Giant Air Shower Array (AGASA) [2].

A distance dependence of the signal size has been measured earlier and is described in <ref> [1] </ref>. The above effect can account for the high number of zero counts in the non-trigger PMTs at lower thresholds. This thesis is supported by the fact that the number of zero counts in PMT 2 and 3 decreases with increasing trigger threshold.

Reference-contexts: They view the tank volume in a downwards direction from the top surface. The dimensions of this detector have been chosen according to the design report of the Pierre Auger Project <ref> [3] </ref>; simulations have demonstrated that the specified dimensions fulfill the project requirements. The photomultipli-ers have a pseudo-hemispherical, bialkali cathode with typical effective area of 530 cm 2 .
