Reference-contexts: But which should serve as representative of "the language"? Strong evidence for rhythmic constraints on the intervals between the onsets of stressed syllables in English has been demonstrated in a task specifically designed to elicit rhythmic speech (speech cycling) <ref> (Cummins and Port, 1998) </ref>. When subjects repeat a phrase like "beg for a dime" in time with a perfectly regular metronome, there are three, and only three, stable patterns, each of which corresponds to a simple 2- or 3-beat rhythm, based on the onsets of accented (stressed) syllables.

Reference-contexts: Some researchers attempting to develop systems for automatic language identification (LID) have found F 0 to be of limited use in improving overall identification performance, but currently, LID is best performed using segmental and phonotactic information <ref> (Hazen and Zue, 1994) </ref>. The most direct study of the utility of prosodic features in LID is summarized in Thyme-Gobbel and Hutchins (1996). Discrimination between pairs of English, Japanese, Mandarin and Spanish samples was attempted using 224 individual features and feature pairs.

Similarly inconclusive results were obtained by Dauer (1983) for English, Spanish, Italian, Greek and Thai. The absence of empirical support for a rhythmic taxonomy based on isochrony contrasts with the finding that some languages are perceived as rhythmically similar.

Reference-contexts: learning progresses, the biases become progressively less negative, and, one after another, the memory blocks begin to contribute to the network computation. 8 This is one approach to the general goal in network training of ensuring that separate hidden units or elements attempt to solve separate parts of the problem <ref> (Mozer and Smolensky, 1989) </ref>. Network parameters were initially fixed based on pilot experiments in which networks were trained to discriminate between English and Mandarin on a subset of the data later employed in the experiments reported here.

Reference-contexts: Surprisingly, Mandarin and Japanese were not well discriminated based on F 0 , but were quite well discriminated based on amplitude envelope modulation. 2 Speech materials For all experiments we use speech from the Oregon Graduate Institute Telephone Speech corpus (OGI TS) <ref> (Muthusamy et al., 1992) </ref>, which is available from the Linguistic Data Consortium. This database contains recordings of telephone conversations in which speakers responded in their native language to a series of prompts designed to elicit speech on a continuum from specific lexical items to unconstrained monologue.

Reference-contexts: In this way, we hope to compare prosodic systems, without recourse to any specific set of hypothetical phonological primitives. We seek to establish an empirical measure of similarity which does not presuppose discrete classes, thus putting flesh to the concept of prosodic, or rhythmic, distance <ref> (Nazzi et al., 1998) </ref>. The present work is an extension of a study in which we trained networks to discriminate among the languages English, German, Spanish, Mandarin and Japanese (Cummins et al., submitted).

Reference-contexts: Here, the distinction, often claimed but rarely supported, between syllable-timed and stress-timed languages is apparent in the clusters obtained. The failure to separate English and German from Japanese is unexpected, given that mora-timing is perhaps the only "rhythmic type" for which durational measurements actually offer strong support <ref> (Port et al., 1987) </ref>. However, the regularity observed there was in fact non-local, in that mean mora duration remained constant, while the duration of individual morae varied substantially. It is possible, therefore, that the amplitude envelope modulation is, in fact, quite similar to that of a stress-timed language.
