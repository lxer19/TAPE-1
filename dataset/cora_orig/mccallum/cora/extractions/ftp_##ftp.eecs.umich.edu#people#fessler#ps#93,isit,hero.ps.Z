Abstract: We give a class of iterative algorithms to monotonically approximate submatrices of the CR matrix bound on the covariance of any estimator of a vector parameter . A natural implementation of the iterative algorithm employs a "complete data incomplete data" formulation similar to that underlying the EM parameter estimation algorithm. Our results make it feasible to compute CR-type bounds for previously intractible problems involving a large number of "nuisance parameters," such as arise in image reconstruction. The Cramer-Rao (CR) bound on estimator covari-ance is an important tool for predicting fundamental limits on best achievable parameter estimation performance [5], predicting the impact of side information and constraints on estimation performance [3], and obtaining optimal experimental designs [1]. For a vector parameter 2 fi IR n the upper left p fi p matrix of the inverse of the n fi n Fisher information matrix provides the CR lower bound on the minimum achievable covariance of any unbiased estimator of 1 ; : : : ; p , p n. Equivalently, the first p rows of F 1

Reference-contexts: These algorithms fall into the class of "splitting matrix iterations" <ref> [2] </ref>. The inverse of this splitting matrix should be sparse and simply determined. The splitting matrix is chosen based on purely algebraic or purely statistical considerations to ensure that a valid lower bound results at each iteration of the algorithm.
