Abstract: We introduce the "Book Trick" as a method for using results about random oracles to create relativized worlds with an infinite polynomial-time hierarchy. We use it to show, for example, a single relativized world where

Reference-contexts: One notable exception is the work of Sheu and Long [SL96] separating the low and high hierarchies. We show how to use the theory of random oracles to help create relativized worlds where the polynomial-time hierarchy is infinite.

Proof of Corollary 3.7: Kautz and Milterson [KM96], Watanabe and Toda [WT93] and Bennet and Gill <ref> [BG81] </ref> respectively show that the first three statements hold relative to a random oracle. Corollary 3.7 immediately follows from Lemma 3.6. 2 4 The Complexity of SPP We can also use the Book Trick to show the potential surprising power of the counting class SPP.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we introduce a new technique using random oracles. We show how to use a recent result by Ron Book to turn results on random oracles to results on oracles that make the polynomial-time hierarchy infinite. Ron Book <ref> [Boo94] </ref> showed that if the polynomial-hierarchy collapses relative to a random oracle then it collapses unrelativized. <p> Ron Book <ref> [Boo94] </ref> proves the following result. Theorem 3.4 (Book) If relative to random R the polynomial-time hierarchy collapses then the (unrelativized) polynomial-time hierarchy collapses. A close of examination of Book's proof and the proof of Nisan and Wigderson [NW94] that Book uses shows that Theorem 3.4 relativizes.

Reference-contexts: Many complexity theorists had believed in the "random oracle hypothesis" where propositions holding relative to a random oracle should also hold in the unrelativized world. Recent work on interactive proofs have put that hypothesis to rest (see <ref> [CCG + 94] </ref>). Still we can use tools for random oracles to show that oracle exist. One of these tools is the Kolmogorov Zero-One law.

Reference-contexts: Watanabe and Toda [WT93] show that Proposition 1.1 holds relative to a random oracle. Using our techniques, we then show that there exists a relativized world where the polynomial-time hierarchy is infinite and Proposition 1.1 holds. We also examine the counting class SPP defined by Fenner, Fortnow and Kurtz <ref> [FFK94] </ref> and give a relativized world where SPP strictly contains an infinite polynomial-time hierarchy. 2 Preliminaries We assume the reader familiar with Turing machines and standard complexity classes such as P, NP and coNP and the concept of relativization. <p> Fenner, Fortnow and Kurtz <ref> [FFK94] </ref> define the GapP functions and show many interesting properties of them.

One can try a direct construction, using such combinatorial techniques such as the H-astad switching lemma [H-as89] but these approaches are complicated at best. Another useful but limited direction involves generic oracles (see <ref> [FFKL93] </ref>). In this paper, we introduce a new technique using random oracles. We show how to use a recent result by Ron Book to turn results on random oracles to results on oracles that make the polynomial-time hierarchy infinite. <p> Fortnow [For97], in his survey on counting complexity, states the following result without proof. Theorem 4.1 There exists an relativized world where SPP strictly contains an infinite polynomial-time hierarchy. Theorem 4.1 gives an interesting contrast with the following result proven by Fenner, Fortnow, Kurtz and Li <ref> [FFKL93] </ref> using generic oracles. Theorem 4.2 There exists a relativized world where P = SPP and the polynomial-time hierarchy is infinite. We present the first published proof of Theorem 4.1. <p> However, we cannot assume SPP R has a complete set, in fact there are relativized worlds where SPP does not have complete sets (see <ref> [FFKL93] </ref>). We get around this problem by analyzing Toda and Ogihara's construction [TO92] for Theo rem 4.3. If L R i is the standard relativizable complete set for p i then the construction produces the machine N above using running time O (n 10 i ).

Reference-contexts: Fortnow <ref> [For94] </ref> gives an overview of relativization and its importance in complexity theory. The polynomial-time hierarchy is a generalization of NP defined inductively. We let p and i+1 = NP i for i 0. We let PH = i0 p i .

Reference-contexts: A natural question arises as to whether one can simply create a relativized world where SPP does not lie in the polynomial-time hierarchy. Fortnow <ref> [For97] </ref>, in his survey on counting complexity, states the following result without proof. Theorem 4.1 There exists an relativized world where SPP strictly contains an infinite polynomial-time hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Creating an relativized world where the polynomial-time hierarchy is infinite was one of more difficult constructions in the mid-1980's.

These days we often have the task of making some other proposition true while making the polynomial-time hierarchy infinite. Consider, for example, the following proposition.
