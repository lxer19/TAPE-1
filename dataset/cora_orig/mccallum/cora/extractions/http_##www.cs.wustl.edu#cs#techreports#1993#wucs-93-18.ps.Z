Reference-contexts: Annalysis of collected data. Twelve CS students with little pen experience were chosen as subjects. Four diagrams of similar complexity were selected, one each from the categories of dataflow visual programs, Petri nets, flowcharts, and state diagrams. We have developed a pen-based diagram editor for GO's PenPoint <ref> [1] </ref> running on NCR3125 pen computer [9]. The editor can recognize and respond to shapes and gesture commands. Appsoft's Draw version 1.02 [4] on NeXT was used as the mouse-based diagram editor. A random task assignment table was constructed. Procedures and instruction sheets for the subjects were prepared.

Reference-contexts: The existing tools for diagram drawing, such as MacDraw, use the mouse/menu paradigm of user interface. The pen/gesture paradigm offers a possibly improved alternative. The pen user interface is heralded as more natural and powerful than the mouse, due to pointing, handwriting, gesturing, and drawing <ref> [3, 5, 6] </ref>. It is widely believed that the pen is mightier than the mouse. There are comparison studies of different input devices such as pen, mouse and keyboard in different application areas, e.g., [10] for spreadsheet applications and [8] for text entry.

To address the second difficulty, we evaluated a commercial product, NoteTaker 1.0.3 of InkWare <ref> [6] </ref>, as a possible candidate for pen-based drawing tool. We found that it was not suitable for this experiment . Its shape recognition is too limitted. In NoteTaker every graphic object, e.g., a rectangle or a circle, must be entered by a single stroke for correct recognition.
