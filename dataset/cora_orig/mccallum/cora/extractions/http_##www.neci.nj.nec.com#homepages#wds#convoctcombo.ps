Abstract: The volume of a 3-dimensional polyhedron with triangular faces is known to be the root of a polynomial (depending on the combinatorial type of the polyhedron), whose coefficients are polynomials (with integer coefficients) of the squared edge lengths. We show this polynomial has degree D 3 2 3N9 , where N is the number of vertices. However, for an infinite class of polyhedral types, D 2 N4 . In the case of an octahedron, we show the squared volume has a minimal polynomial of degree 168, but the structure of the polynomial is such that one may solve it by only solving polynomials of degree 21. In the case of a centro-symmetric octahedron, the formula for the volume in terms of its squared edge lengths is quite simple and the degree of the minimal polynomial obeyed by the squared volume is 2. The degree 21 and 168 results are proven with the partial aid of a "probabilistic proof" of a new type - that is, these numbers are valid lower bounds, but are only valid as upper bounds with a very low (&lt; 10 20 failure probability; non-probabilistically, 42 and 336 are valid upper bounds. (The present paper may be the first to have the gall to prove a mathematical identity with a probabilistic proof.) Keywords | Octahedron, polyhedron, volume, rigidity, probabilistic proof, resultants, Riemann hypothesis over finite fields, Swinnerton-Dyer polynomials.

Now, allow the non-generic, non-rigid case. The coefficients of the volume-yielding polynomial guaranteed by <ref> [4] </ref> to exist are polynomials in the squared edge lengths. And these polynomials happen to coincide generically with the coefficient polynomials from our resultant.

Reference-contexts: In the generic case when the polyhedron is determined (up to a finite number of branches) by its edge lengths, everything is determined by solving our big polynomial system, and "resultants" yield a valid solution.

Reference-contexts: Apparently my computer hardware and/or software was not powerful enough to accomplish this task. (In the centro-symmetric case theorems 2 and 4 it was powerful enough, and we got a conventional proof.) The famous paper <ref> [8] </ref> observes that verifying (multivariate) polynomial identities A = B may be accomplished by substituting in random integer values for the variables and computing A and B. <p> Is it possible for such an identity to be true mod p for all p in our set, and yet be untrue over the integers? Well, no, by the same arguments (mentioned before) employed in the usual sort of probabilistic proof of polynomial identities <ref> [8] </ref>. fl 5 Acknowledgements and further discussion Thanks to Paul Lemke, Andrew Odlyzko, and Robert Connelly for helpful comments and discussion. I told Connelly that there are probably other natural invariants, besides volume, which are preserved during flexure of polyhedra.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, at this step, and this step only, I had to resort to a "probabilistic proof." For discussion, see section 4. 2 This fact may be established with the aid of tests in <ref> [11] </ref>. For example, one may test that P 21 has a nonsquare discriminant, is irreducible modulo some small prime, factors into two irreducibles of degrees 1 and 16 mod some other small prime, and factors into two irreducibles of degrees 2 of 15 mod a third small prime. <p> In fact in view of (EQ 1), each T j is a quadratic in q 2 . Now at the same time, q 2 obeys the degree-21 polynomial in theorem 1. By taking the resultant <ref> [11] </ref> of these two polynomials to eliminate q 2 , we get a polynomial of degree 168 = 8 fi 21 in V 2 . Ptheorem 3 5 Let the volume of an octahedron be V .

Reference-contexts: The "Swinnerton-Dyer 8 " polynomial, which is the polynomial above where m 1 ; : : : m r are r primes [13] is irreducible (despite factoring into polynomials of degree 2 modulo every prime!) as may be shown by consideration of Weinberger's algorithm <ref> [12] </ref> [13]. Then Hilbert's irreducibility theorem [13] shows that P (x) must therefore be irreducible for almost all 9 choices of integer m j . The lower bound is now established. The upper bound arises as follows.
