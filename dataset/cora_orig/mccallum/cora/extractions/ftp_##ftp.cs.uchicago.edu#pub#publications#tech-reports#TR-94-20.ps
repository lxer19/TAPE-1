Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate an oracle relative to which there are one-way functions but every paddable 1-li-degree collapses to an isomorphism type, thus yielding a relativized failure of the Joseph-Young Conjecture (JYC) [JY85]. We then use this result to construct an oracle relative to which the Isomorphism Conjecture (IC) is true but one-way functions exist, which answers an open question of Fenner, Fortnow, and Kurtz [FFK92]. Thus, there are now relativizations realizing every one of the four possible states of affairs between the IC and the existence of one-way functions.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 3.2 implies that there is no relativizable way to extend their technique (which relativizes) to show that the noncollapsing degree is paddable. We also have: Corollary 3.5 There is an oracle relative to which the complete m-degree of EXP collapses and there are one-way functions. Proof. Berman <ref> [Ber77] </ref> showed that the m-degree of EXP collapses absolutely to a paddable 1-li-degree. Let C = H G, where H is an oracle making P = PSPACE and G is a UP-generic oracle. Then the complete 1-li-degree of EXP C collapses but there are still one-way functions.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Berman and Hartmanis <ref> [BH76, BH77] </ref> showed that if two languages A and B are equivalent to one another under polynomial-time many-to-one reductions and if they are both paddable then they are polynomial-time isomorphic. <p> So running f with the input p S;1 (g (w); *) will find c. Knowing c now allows us to calculate f 1 (w) correctly. Claim 2. 7 Because S and T both have padding functions and are in the same 1-li-degree, they are isomorphic <ref> [BH76] </ref>. For the first time, we now have that: Corollary 3.3 There is an oracle relative to which there are one-way functions but the Joseph-Young Conjecture fails.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Berman and Hartmanis <ref> [BH76, BH77] </ref> showed that if two languages A and B are equivalent to one another under polynomial-time many-to-one reductions and if they are both paddable then they are polynomial-time isomorphic. <p> And now we can return to one-way functions. If one-way functions do not exist then every 1-li function is invertible, that is, every 1-li-degree is a 1-li-inv-degree and Berman and Hartmanis <ref> [BH77] </ref> showed that every 1-li-inv-degree collapses. On the other hand, Ko, Long, and Du [KLD86] showed that if one-way functions do exist then length-increasing one-way functions also exist and that there is a nonpaddable 1-li-degree in exponential time that does not collapse.

Reference-contexts: Now we can apply theorem 3.2 to collapse these 1-li-degrees in the presence of one-way functions. Corollary 3.7 There is an oracle relative to which the complete m-degrees of RE and NEXP collapse and there are one-way functions. 8 Proof. Dowd <ref> [Dow] </ref> showed that the complete m-degree of RE collapses absolutely to a 1-degree and Ganesan and Homer [GH89] showed the same for NEXP.

Reference-contexts: This conjecture has been neither proven nor refuted and, because there are oracles relative to which it fails [Kur83, KMR89, HH91] and holds <ref> [FFK92] </ref>, doing so will probably require new proof techniques. In the meantime, we can try to demonstrate relationships between the IC and other complexity-theoretic propositions. <p> However, relative to C, the IC 1li does hold. What about an oracle relative to which the IC is true? This eluded researchers for quite a while. Finally, Fenner, Fortnow, and Kurtz <ref> [FFK92] </ref> proved that, relative to a symmetric perfect generic oracle A, the IC holds. <p> We then combine this result with a modified version of the proof of Fenner, Fortnow, and Kurtz to derive an oracle relative to which the IC holds but one-way functions exist. This answers an open question posed by Fenner, Fortnow, and Kurtz <ref> [FFK92] </ref> and completes the 3 line of research whose history is sketched above. Collectively, these results show that any proof of a relationship between the IC and the existence of one-way functions cannot be relativizable. <p> Collectively, these results show that any proof of a relationship between the IC and the existence of one-way functions cannot be relativizable. As most complexity theory proofs relativize, it seems we will need new techniques to attack this problem. We should mention that, despite the results here and in <ref> [FFK92] </ref>, most researchers in this area believe that the ECSC is true and so that the IC is false. 2 Definitions We assume familiarity with the function class FP and the complexity classes P, UP, FewP, NP, PSPACE, EXP and NEXP. <p> The definitions that follow are standard or are taken from <ref> [FFK92, FFKL93, FR93] </ref>. Let = f0; 1g. Languages and oracles are subsets of fl . n denotes the set of all strings of length n. <p> An oracle G is sp- or UP-generic if it meets all dense, definable sets of sp- or UP-conditions. That sp- and UP-generic sets exist follows from <ref> [FFK92] </ref> and [FFKL93]. 3 Results In this section, we construct an oracle relative to which the Isomorphism Conjecture is true and there are one-way functions. The proof is in three major parts. <p> Proof. Let C = A G, where A is an sp-generic and G is a UP A -generic. G is sparse so, by theorem 3.9, the m-degree of SAT C collapses to a 1-li-degree. Fenner, Fortnow, and Kurtz <ref> [FFK92] </ref> showed that P A = UP A so, by corollary 3.4, P C 6= UP C and every paddable 1-li-degree collapses. <p> We do this by performing some straightforward modifications to the proof in <ref> [FFK92] </ref> that, relative to an sp-generic A, the m-degree of SAT A collapses to a 1-li-degree. In that paper, they also show that there are no one-way functions relative to A so the 1-li-degree collapses to an isomorphism type. In fact, they show that P A = FewP A . <p> This comes at a cost: Our proof relies heavily on the presence or absence of strings of a particular form in the oracle while the older proof does not. Fix an m-reduction f and a language L such that f C m-reduces SAT C to L. As in <ref> [FFK92] </ref>, we show in the following lemma that there exists a function g 2 FP C that also m-reduces SAT C to L but in addition is length-increasing and many-to-one only on instances in SAT C and even then that there is a polynomial bounding how many elements in SAT C <p> As noted above, there are no one-way functions relative to A so if S is an oracle relative to which there are no one-way functions the m-degree of SAT C collapses, yielding a different proof than the one given in <ref> [FFK92] </ref>. 4 Conclusions and open problems The one-way functions considered here are extremely weak. The ones considered in [KMR89], scrambling and annihilating functions, are extremely powerful. The gap between them seems enormous.

Languages and oracles are subsets of fl . n denotes the set of all strings of length n. <p> Because the m-degree of SAT C is a 1-li-degree and SAT C is paddable, the m-degree of SAT C collapses. 3.1 Every paddable 1-li-degree collapses and P 6= UP To get this result, we use a UP-generic oracle G, relative to which one-way functions exist <ref> [FR93] </ref>. G is sparse so, relative to A G, where A is sp-generic, the m-degree of SAT AG is a 1-li-degree. But how do these one-way functions affect the collapse of this 1-li-degree? By [KLD86], they are sufficient to prevent the collapse of some 1-li-degree. <p> As the following shows, though, they cannot prevent the collapse of paddable 1-li-degrees. 5 Theorem 3.2 Assume that P = UP. Then relative to a UP-generic oracle G, there are one-way functions but every paddable 1-li-degree collapses to an isomorphism type. Proof. Fix G, a UP-generic. Fortnow and Rogers <ref> [FR93] </ref> showed that P G 6= UP G . Fix a language S that is paddable with respect to G.

Reference-contexts: In the meantime, we can try to demonstrate relationships between the IC and other complexity-theoretic propositions.

Some of this work was done while being partially supported by NSF grant CCR 92-53582. only if one-way functions exist, that is, one-to-one, honest polynomial-time functions that are not polynomial-time invertible. <p> It is an isomorphism if it is one-to-one, onto, and invertible. It is one-way if it is one-to-one, honest, and not invertible. Note that one-way functions exist if and only if P 6= UP <ref> [GS88] </ref>. If a type of reduction possesses transitive closure (as all of the above do), we can define an equivalence relation under which two languages are equivalent if each is reducible to the other by that type of reduction. We call the equivalence classes degrees.

What if there are no one-way functions? Is it still possible for the IC to fail? The answer is yes: Hartmanis and Hemachandra <ref> [HH91] </ref> demonstrated an oracle C relative to which there are no one-way functions but the IC still fails because the m-degree of SAT C does not collapse to a 1-degree. However, relative to C, the IC 1li does hold.

Reference-contexts: Could this failure of collapse happen to the 1-li-degree of SAT? This question was first treated in depth when Joseph and Young <ref> [JY85] </ref> defined the k-creative languages K k f , where k 1 and f is a length-increasing, polynomial-time function. If f is one-way, it was not (and is not) obvious that all of the resulting languages, which are NP-complete, are paddable.

Reference-contexts: And now we can return to one-way functions. If one-way functions do not exist then every 1-li function is invertible, that is, every 1-li-degree is a 1-li-inv-degree and Berman and Hartmanis [BH77] showed that every 1-li-inv-degree collapses. On the other hand, Ko, Long, and Du <ref> [KLD86] </ref> showed that if one-way functions do exist then length-increasing one-way functions also exist and that there is a nonpaddable 1-li-degree in exponential time that does not collapse. <p> G is sparse so, relative to A G, where A is sp-generic, the m-degree of SAT AG is a 1-li-degree. But how do these one-way functions affect the collapse of this 1-li-degree? By <ref> [KLD86] </ref>, they are sufficient to prevent the collapse of some 1-li-degree. As the following shows, though, they cannot prevent the collapse of paddable 1-li-degrees. 5 Theorem 3.2 Assume that P = UP.

Reference-contexts: This corollary and the fact that P G 6= UP G have some interesting implications and we will digress briefly to investigate them. In <ref> [KLD87] </ref>, they show that if one-way functions exist then there is a 1-li-degree that does not collapse. Theorem 3.2 implies that there is no relativizable way to extend their technique (which relativizes) to show that the noncollapsing degree is paddable.

In the first of these results, Kurtz, Mahaney, and Royer <ref> [KMR89] </ref> showed that if one-way functions called scrambling functions exist then the IC fails. A scrambling function is a one-way function whose image is not paddable. They then showed that, relative to a random oracle R, scrambling functions exist. <p> The ones considered in <ref> [KMR89] </ref>, scrambling and annihilating functions, are extremely powerful. The gap between them seems enormous. A natural question is: How much power must one-way functions possess to make the IC fails? Here we have all paddable 1-li-degrees collapsing. <p> Is it the case that if the 1-li-degree of SAT collapses then all of the paddable 1-li-degrees collapse? Also, if the Isomorphism Conjecture holds for NP, must it also hold for EXP? Acknowledgements The introduction of this paper owes much to the account in the introduction of <ref> [KMR89] </ref>. I especially thank Stuart Kurtz, my advisor, and Lance Fortnow for presenting this problem to me and engaging in numerous fruitful and (more importantly) encouraging discussions about it.

Reference-contexts: They posed: The Joseph-Young Conjecture (JYC) There is a one-way length-increasing function f such that, for some k, K k f is not paddable. 2 Isomorphisms preserve paddability so SAT, which is paddable, and K k f would be 1-li-equivalent but not isomorphic. This led Selman <ref> [Sel92] </ref> to observe that the JYC implies a simpler conjecture: The Encrypted Complete Set Conjecture (ECSC) There is a one-way function f such that SAT and f (SAT) are not polynomial-time isomorphic. Once again, these conjectures have been neither proven nor refuted.
