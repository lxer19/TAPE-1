Abstract: As the scale and the complexity of parallel computer systems grow rapidly, the study of interactions between application algorithms and parallel architectures becomes more important. Execution-driven simulation under realistic workloads proves to be an accurate and efficient technique for studying the performance of computer systems. However, direct-execution simulation of shared-memory cache-coherent architectures incurs large overheads. The problem will be further exaggerated by the large scale of interconnected processors. In this report, we propose a design of an execution-driven simulator that evaluates the performance of application algorithms running on large-scale distributed shared-memory cache-coherent architectures. We study the tradeoffs inside the simulator between simulation accuracy and execution time so as to limit the slowdowns introduce by instrumentation and simulation by a factor of 10. Instead of expensive simulation of cache coherence, we introduce calculation of cache miss penalties and invalidation costs from cache design target miss rates. Also, we present a scheme that defers timing calculations for global memory references until synchronization points. Such scheme will help simulate the network contentions in a cost-effective way without detail simulations of the cache behavior. The simulator will synchronizing thousands up to millions of parallel processors. Therefore, the state space must be kept out-of-core. The simulator captures the working set along execution so that the I/O cost could be reduced to the minimum. Also, the shared memory in the target system is stored on disk. The simulator manages buffers, where working sets of global shared-memory references are prefetched.
