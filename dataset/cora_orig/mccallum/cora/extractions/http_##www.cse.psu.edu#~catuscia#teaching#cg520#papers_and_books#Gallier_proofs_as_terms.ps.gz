Abstract: The correspondence between natural deduction proofs and -terms is presented and discussed. A variant of the reducibility method is presented, and a general theorem for establishing properties of typed (first-order) -terms is proved. As a corollary, we obtain a simple proof of the Church-Rosser property, and of the strong normalization property, for the typed -calculus associated with the system of (intuitionistic) first-order natural deduction, including all the connectors !, fi, +, 8, 9, and ? (falsity) (with or without j-like rules). fl This research was partially supported by ONR Grant NOOO14-88-K-0593.

Reference-contexts: This way, inference rules have a reading as "type-checking rules". This discovery due to Curry and Howard is known as the Curry/Howard isomorphism, or formulae-as-types principle [12]. An early occurrence of this correspondence can be found in Curry and Feys <ref> [2] </ref> (1958), Chapter 9E, pages 312-315. Furthermore, and this is the deepest aspect of the Curry/Howard isomorphism, proof normalization corresponds to term reduction in the -calculus associated with the proof system.

Reference-contexts: Then, argue that if the above propositions have a proof in normal form, this leads to a contradiction. Another even simpler method is to use cut-free Gentzen systems. The interested reader is referred to Gallier <ref> [3] </ref>. The typed -calculus !;fi;+;? corresponding to N oe;^;_;? i is given in the following definition. Definition 3.2 The typed -calculus !;fi;+;? is defined by the following rules. ; x: A . x: A . 5 A (M ): A (?-elim) with A 6=?, ; x: A .

Reference-contexts: We will give another proof in section 8. Theorem 3.5 [Strong normalization, Prawitz (1971)] Reduction in !;fi;+;? (as in Definition 3.3) is strongly normalizing. A proof can be given by adapting Tait's reducibility method [20], [21], as done in Girard [8] (1971), [9] (1972) (see also Gallier <ref> [5] </ref>). We will give another proof in section 8. 4 First-Order Quantifiers We extend the system N oe;^;_;? i to deal with the quantifiers. <p> A further generalization would be to allow higher-order quantification as in Girard's system F ! (see Girard [9] or Gallier <ref> [5] </ref>). <p> We will give another proof in section 8. Theorem 4.5 [Strong normalization, Prawitz (1971)] Reduction in !;fi;+;8;9;? is strongly normalizing. A proof can be given by adapting Tait's reducibility method [20], [21], as done in Girard [8] (1971), [9] (1972) (see also Gallier <ref> [5] </ref>). We will give another proof in section 8. If one looks carefully at the structure of proofs, one realizes that it is not unreasonable to declare other proofs as being redundant, and thus to add some additional reduction rules. <p> Actually, because x =2 F V (M 1 ) in such situations, it is possible to prove that confluence holds from x: oe: M . Such a verification is carried out in Appendix 2 (page 196-198) of Gallier <ref> [5] </ref>. The other cases can also be handled, and are left to the (perseverant) reader (in fact, they are easier!). One should realize that the Church-Rosser property in the presence of j-like reductions fails for terms that do not type-check. <p> In our approach, terms must type-check, and the above problem does not arise. The reducibility method presented in this paper immediately extends to the second-order - calculus, or to Girard's system F ! (as presented in <ref> [5] </ref>). It can also easily be adapted to the systems of conjunctive types due to Coppo and Dezani as presented in Krivine [14] (system D and system D for pure -terms). However, we will now grant our reader a well deserved break, and treat such extensions elsewhere.

Reference-contexts: Actually, in order to salvage some form of subformula property ruined by the introduction of the connectives _, 9, and ?, one can add further conversions known as "commuting conversions" (or "permutative conversions"). A lucid discussion of the necessity for such rules can be found in Girard <ref> [7] </ref>. Theorem 4.4 and theorem 4.5 can be extended to cover the reduction rules of definition 4.3 together with the new reductions rules, but at the cost of rather tedious and rather noninstructive technical complications. <p> Due to the lack of space, we will not elaborate any further on this subject and simply refer the interested reader to Prawitz [16], Girard [9], or Girard <ref> [7] </ref> for details. 5 P -Candidates for the Arrow Type Constructor ! We first motivate our version of the reducibility method. The situation is that we have a unary predicate P describing a property of (typed) -terms, and a type-inference system S. <p> In 18 the literature, this is often referred to as being a candidate. Inspired by the paper by Koletsos [13], we use the notion of a P-candidate defined in definition 5.4. This notion has the advantage of not requiring the terms to be strongly normalizing (as in Girard <ref> [7] </ref>), or to involve rather strange looking terms such as M [N=x]N 1 : : : N k (as in Tait, Mitchell, or Krivine).
