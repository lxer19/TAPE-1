Title: Emergent Phenomena and Complexity

Abstract: I seek to define rigorously the concept of an emergent phenomenon in a complex system, together with its implications for explanation, understanding and prediction in such systems. I argue that in a certain fundamental sense, emergent systems are those in which even perfect knowledge and understanding may give us no predictive information. In them the optimal means of prediction is simulation. I investigate the consequences of this for certain de-cidability and complexity issues, and then explain why these limitations do not preclude all means of doing interesting science in such systems. I touch upon some recent incorporation of this work into the investigation of self-organised criticalities.

Reference-contexts: Rather than viewing this as the first step in the hierarchical evolution of hyperstructures <ref> (Baas 1993) </ref>, I am interested in `first-order emergence' in its own right, as it is currently more amenable to a precise formalisa-tion than the elusive increase in complexity one observes in natural evolution.

Reference-contexts: Thus CA will fit within this framework, with many other systems, although perhaps very few will satisfy the critical property. This is the kind of phenomenon which is likely to be emergent for many R. Current research <ref> (Darley and Kauffman 1994) </ref> dealing with one particular type of rule R | describing the interactions between predictive agents in an artificial economy | has demonstrated the existence of robust self organised dynamic equilibria.

Reference-contexts: Whether a cellular automaton is in class I, II or III has been shown (Culik and Yu 1988; Sutner 1990) to be undecidable. It follows that the question of emergence in infinite systems is undecidable, with a possible reduction to NP-complete status for finite systems <ref> (Green 1987) </ref>. More heuristically, by considering the halting problem for any complex system which is capable of universal computation, we know that the best (only) means of prediction in such a situation is to `run the program' - i.e. perform the simulation.

Reference-contexts: Emergence as I describe it here has been loosely termed `computational emergence' by Cariani (1992). However, abstract computer simulations have been used ever more frequently to gain an understanding of physical phenomena (Toffoli and Margolus 1987; Farmer, Kauffman, and Packard 1986) and in the evolution of specific functionality <ref> (Koza 1993) </ref>. So computational emergence can, I feel, bear upon Cariani's `thermodynamic emergence' and `emergence relative to a model'.

Reference-contexts: For example, it has been demonstrated that in certain highly symmetric classes of one-dimensional cellular automata, the single cell at the bottom of a light-cone after n time-steps can be predicted more quickly than the n (n 1)=2 steps of a simulation: Linear CA <ref> (Martin et al. 1984) </ref> have u ~ n ) ~ ' 2=n; ' 1.
