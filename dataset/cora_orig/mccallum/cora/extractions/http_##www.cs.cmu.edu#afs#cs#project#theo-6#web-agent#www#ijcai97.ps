Abstract: We explore the notion of a tour guide software agent for assisting users browsing the World Wide Web. A Web tour guide agent provides assistance similar to that provided by a human tour guide in a museum it guides the user along an appropriate path through the collection, based on its knowledge of the user's interests, of the location and relevance of various items in the collection, and of the way in which others have interacted with the collection in the past. This paper describes a simple but operational tour guide, called Web-Watcher, which has given over 5000 tours to people browsing CMU's School of Computer Science Web pages. WebWatcher accompanies users from page to page, suggests appropriate hyperlinks, and learns from experience to improve its advice-giving skills. We describe the learning algorithms used by WebWatcher, experimental results showing their effectiveness, and lessons learned from this case study in Web tour guide agents.

Reference-contexts: The system uses the ratings to learn a user specific topic profile that can be used to suggest unexplored hyperlinks on the page. Syskill and Webert can also use search engines like LYCOS to retrieve pages by turning the topic profile into a query. Lira <ref> [ Balabanovic and Shoham, 1995 ] </ref> works in an offline setting. A general model of one user's interest is learned by asking the user to rate pages.

Reference-contexts: We chose a distance-weighted 3-nearest neighbor function approximator [ Mitchell, 1997 ] for this purpose, because of the many features needed to describe pages and hyperlinks, and because of certain theoretical advantages <ref> [ Gordon, 1995 ] </ref> . Each hyperlink a is described by the TFIDF vector representation of the underlined anchor text, each page s analogously by its title.

Reference-contexts: It also provides a user command "Show me similar pages" in the command list, which causes WebWatcher to display a list of pages which are similar based on a metric derived from hypertext structure <ref> [ Joachims et al., 1995 ] </ref> . Clicking on the command "how many followed each link?" asks WebWatcher to display for each hyperlink the number of previous visitors who took that link.

Reference-contexts: These results suggest that predicting which hyperlink the user is going to follow is a fairly difficult task in a general setting. In comparison to human performance the learning approach does reasonably well. 5 Related Work Letizia <ref> [ Lieberman, 1995 ] </ref> is similar to WebWatcher in the sense that the system accompanies the user while browsing. One difference is that Letizia is located on a single user's machine and learns only his or her current interest. By doing lookahead search Letizia can recommend nearby pages.

Reference-contexts: Like a museum tour guide, WebWatcher interactively suggests where to go next. The user can communicate with the system and give feedback. WebWatcher acts as a learning apprentice <ref> [ Mitchell et al., 1994 ] </ref> , observing and learning from its users' actions.

Reference-contexts: Such an agent could learn a model of the longer-term interests of users by observing which pages they do and do not visit. We have recently begun experiments with such a personalized WebWatcher <ref> [ Mladenic, 1996 ] </ref> . * Combining user-specific and Web locale-specific learning. At the same time WebWatcher learns a model of one particular user, it could retain its capability to annotate hyperlinks based on tours given to many users.

Reference-contexts: One difference is that Letizia is located on a single user's machine and learns only his or her current interest. By doing lookahead search Letizia can recommend nearby pages. Syskill and Webert <ref> [ Pazzani et al., 1996 ] </ref> offers a more restricted way of browsing than WebWatcher and Letizia. Starting from a manually constructed index page for a particular topic, the user can rate hyperlinks off this page.

Reference-contexts: WebWatcher suggests those hyperlinks which have a description sufficiently similar to the user's interest. The metric used to compute similarity between a user's stated interest and a hyperlink description is based on a technique from information retrieval <ref> [ Salton, 1991 ] </ref> . Interests and hyperlink descriptions are represented by very high-dimensional feature vectors, each dimension representing a particular word in the English language. The elements (called word-weights) of a vector are calculated using the TFIDF heuristic [ Salton, 1991 ] . <p> a hyperlink description is based on a technique from information retrieval <ref> [ Salton, 1991 ] </ref> .
