Abstract: Hubler's technique using aperiodic forces to drive nonlinear oscillators to resonance is analyzed. The oscillators being examined are effective neurons that model Hopfield neural networks. The method is shown to be valid under several different circumstances. It is verified through analysis of the power spectrum, force, resonance, and energy transfer of the system.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In 1982, Hopfield introduced the dynamical neural network that is now referred to as the Hopfield neural network <ref> [1] </ref>. This was important for neural network research because it demonstrated how a network built from simple processing units, or neurons, could have emergent collective computational abilities.

Reference-contexts: Since Hopfield's work in the early 1980's, there has been an explosion of research in the field of neural networks <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. The Hopfield neural network, as presented by Hopfield in 1982, is a system of neurons where each neuron can be in one of two states, V = 0 or V = 1. The system evolves through asynchronous updating of each neuron's state.

This principle is used extensively in statistical physics and quantum optics. System variables are divided between those that evolve quickly to a steady-state and those that evolve more slowly.

Reference-contexts: Nonlinear oscillators have a frequency-amplitude coupling, where the frequency always changes if the amplitude changes. This coupling makes it difficult for a sinusoidal driving force to drive a nonlinear oscillator to resonance, so a more complex force, such as the one suggested by Hubler <ref> [10, 11, 12, 13] </ref>, is required. The method for bringing a nonlinear system to resonance requires finding an aperiodic driving force that matches at all times the frequency and phase of the system. This is accomplished by calculating the time-reflected transient dynamics of the unperturbed nonlinear system. <p> 1 _ U 1 + R 1 = J 11 tanh (U 1 ) + A 1 cos (! 1 t): (12) It is this equation that will be used in following sections. 3 Optimal Resonance Driving The strong resonance case represents optimal resonance driving of a nonlinear system (Hubler <ref> [10] </ref>). Consider first the damped, driven nonlinear oscillator, mx + _x + @x where is the damping constant, and F (t) is the optimal driving force to be determined. <p> Equations (20)-(22) are investigated numerically in the next section. Previously <ref> [10] </ref>, Hubler numerically investigated optimal driving of the pendulum described by y + 1 _y + c 1 y + c 2 sin (y) = F (t): (23) The neuron's potential is resonating, and energy is continuously being fed into the neuron, so the neuron's potential will grow.

Reference-contexts: = fixed; (15) where the constraint on the energy H is given by H = 2 9 With the above constraints, a Lagrangian L = jF (t)j 2 (t)(mx + _x + @x m _x 2 + V (x) H)ffi D (t T ) (17) is obtained (Wargitsch and Hubler <ref> [17] </ref>). Note that in this variational problem T depends upon H, and some subtlety must be employed (Akhiezer [18]). The optimal driving force is F (t) = 2 _y: (18) Here y is a solution to y _y + @y Equation (19) is the time-reflected equation (13) with zero force. <p> There it was shown that despite the presence of many vibrational modes in the system, only the base frequency of the system was stimulated. All of the higher modes remained unexcited. Further numerical results (Wargitsch and Hubler <ref> [17] </ref>) show how the effectiveness of optimal driving increases with nonlinearity in P for 4 Numerical Evidence for Slaving in Driven Systems The main point of this section is to numerically demonstrate the presence of nonlinear resonance in the equations derived at the end of the previous section.

Reference-contexts: The two lower peaks show that the power peak is changing frequency. During the times when the system is affected most by the nonlinearity in the tanh term (~ 350 500 time steps), as delineated in Fig. 6, nonlinear behavior analogous to entrainment (Minorsky <ref> [19] </ref>) begins to take place eventually settling into the frequency exhibited by the two higher peaks. Here the oscillator entrains the effective frequency of the nonlinear driving force, equation (22). This by construction is ! = 1.
