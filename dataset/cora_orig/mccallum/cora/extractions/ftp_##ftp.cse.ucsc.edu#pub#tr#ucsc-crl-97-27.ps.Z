Abstract: This document proposes a new measure for comparing two alignments, referred to as the shift score. This score has a range of * to 1, where * is a small number used as a parameter to the scoring algorithm. A score of 1 is attained only if the two alignments are identical. The shift score is symmetric with respect to the alignments|no distinguished sequence or alignment is needed. The score incorporates both coverage measures and shift error measures into a single number. The shift score is easily computed, and one can find the optimum subalignment of a candidate alignment (the subalignment that maximizes the shift score) with a simple greedy algorithm.

Reference-contexts: To summarize the overall amount of shifting in an alignment, individual shift measures are combined into an overall shift score. Section 3 describes two shift scores: mean shift error and shift score. The mean shift error, detailed in Section 3.1, is the most common statistic on overall shift <ref> [Bry96, MBB97] </ref>. Section 3.2 presents the shift score measure, and makes a case on why it is more useful than mean shift. 2 2.

Mean shift is simply the mean of the absolute shift at all positions in the target sequence for which shift can be measured.

Reference-contexts: On the third point, consider that the existence of one correct structural alignment between two proteins is debatable <ref> [God96] </ref>. When two proteins are aligned by different structural alignment tools, the resulting alignments often contain regions shifted by a few 3.2. Shift score 5 positions. Since there is not one "standard of truth", a penalty levied on small shifts might not be useful.
