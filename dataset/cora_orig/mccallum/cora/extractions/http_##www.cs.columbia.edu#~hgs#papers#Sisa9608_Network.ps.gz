Abstract: In this paper, we present a new video tool, NEVIT. This tool provides the basic capabilities needed for video conferencing services such as video capturing, compression and decompression engines and multicasting and ATM network interfaces. To ease the interaction with other media agents, NEVIT incorporates a message handling facility to interact over a local conference bus with other media agents, a floor controller or the conference controller. Currently, we are working on adding lip synchronisation and quality-of-service control using this conference bus.

Reference-contexts: As extending any of the two tools to support the other's compression style was a non-trivial task, both tools were non-interoperable. More recent tools such as VIC <ref> [8] </ref> support both hardware and software compression engines and offer better performance. VIC supports a limited form of interaction with the VAT audio tool: VAT can signal speaker activity through a mechanism similar to the conference bus. The speaker activity indication then selects which site is displayed in full size.

Reference-contexts: The messages used in this protocol are sent as ASCII text and are formatted to be directly interpretable by a standard Tcl interpreter <ref> [9] </ref>. There are different approaches for implementing a local conference bus. We have chosen the configuration depicted in Fig. 1, in which messages are exchanged using local IP multicast. That is, packets are sent with the time-to-live (ttl) value set to zero.

Reference-contexts: The receiver must use a playout buffer to ensure periodic delivery to the audio or video output device. This process of re-establishing the original timing at the receiver is referred to as intrame-dia synchronisation. The depth of the buffer is adjusted dynamically <ref> [10, 14] </ref>, based on on-line estimates of the delay jitter. Increased buffer depth causes fewer packets to miss their playout time, but also increases end-to-end delay. If lip sync between audio and video is desired, the end-to-end delay of the audio and video streams has to be the same.

Instead, all functions of the tool, including establishing and terminating sessions, are controlled by messages sent on the conference bus. These messages constitute a well defined communication protocol as was defined in <ref> [11] </ref>. Through the messages NEVIT can either communicate with the conference controller or with any other media agent listening to the local conference bus and capable of interpreting the messages.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, a threads-based approach can be used, but requires greater care in managing concurrent access to data structures. For transmitting video data, we use the real time protocol (RTP) <ref> [12] </ref> designed within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). RTP is an end-to-end protocol that is often used together with other transport protocols, in particular UDP. RTP has no notion of a connection; it may operate over either connection-oriented (say, ATM AAL5) or connection--less lower-layer protocols (typically, UDP/IP).

Reference-contexts: Adapting bandwidth to current network conditions requires the exchange of state information between the source and the network nodes or the receivers. The first approach is used for the ATM available bit rate service <ref> [13] </ref>, while the RTP control protocol provides periodic loss feedback from the receivers. Reporting intervals for each receiver range from five seconds to a minute or more. Thus, load spikes can lead to sustained packet losses or unfairness in bandwidth usage 1 .

Reference-contexts: RTCP packets also contain identifying information that allows to connect different media streams with the same participant. 3.2.1 Video Handling NEVIT currently only supports the SunVideo card for capturing and compressing video images. The card supports JPEG, MPEG, CellB and YUV video <ref> [15] </ref>. NEVIT on the other hand, provides the appropriate algorithms for decompressing and displaying JPEG and YUV video images. The JPEG decoder was ported from the VIC video tool. It is based upon the JPEG decompression code provided by the Independent JPEG Group and enhanced with conditional replenishment.

Reference-contexts: This section discusses how reservation and adaptation were implemented in NEVIT. 4.1 Resource Reservations using RSVP Bandwidth reservation is important for videoconferenc-ing to guarantee a minimal level of uninterrupted service throughout the session. For resouce reservations, NEVIT makes use of the receiver-based RSVP <ref> [17] </ref>, building on the ISI RSVP implementation (version 3.2). The data flow is illustrated in Figure 3. The session controller sends a `reserve' message containing flow specifications on the local conference bus, which is picked up by NEVIT.
