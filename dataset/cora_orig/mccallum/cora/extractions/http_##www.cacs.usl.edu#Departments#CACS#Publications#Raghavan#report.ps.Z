Title: INFORMATION RESOURCES DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS: ACHIEVEMENTS AND OPPORTUNITIES Report of the NSF Invitational Workshop on
Keyword: Executive Summary  
Date: April 1, 1994 Preface  
Abstract: This report consists of three parts. Part I presents the Workshop Report and Part II presents a proposal for a National Electronic Library, the ideas for which originated during the workshop. However, the details presented in this part were not actually discussed at the workshop, but were worked out via post-workshop meetings and discussions. Part III is a collection of Position Papers prepared for and presented at the workshop. PART I The Workshop Report Edited by J. S. Deogun, E. Fox, and V. V. Raghavan In recent years, the Division of Information, Robotics and Intelligent systems(IRIS) at the National Science Foundation (NSF) has sponsored a number of workshops to identify future directions for research in a number of disciplines within Computer and Information Sciences. The Workshop on Future Directions in Text Analysis, Retrieval and Understanding was supported by the Database & Expert Systems Program of the NSF in the same spirit and was held on October 10-11, 1991 in Chicago just before the 14th International Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval. The focus of the Chicago workshop was on information as opposed to data, and on supporting users' needs for finding and organizing information contained in document databases. In particular, the impact and future directions in the areas of Information Retrieval (IR), Document Analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Intelligent Document Management Systems were explored. In this report, a system that handles these functions is, collectively, referred to as a Information Resources and Document Management System (IRDMS). The NSF was given a broad directive in its enabling act of 1950 "to foster the interchange of scientific information among scientists." The Office of Science Information Service at the NSF was responsible for providing research funding toward improved methods and techniques for handling scientific information, including mechanized systems, through the Documentation Research Program. The activities of the program was expanded considerably around 1956 under the directorship of Mrs. Helen Brownson. A number of conferences were sponsored by NSF in the early 1960s to chart a plan for research activities in the field of scientific documentation. In the 1970s, the significance of the area was further emphasized at the NSF by the establishment of, for example, the Division for Information Science and Technology. At present,

Reference-contexts: Helen Brownson. The National Defense Education Act of 1958 directed the foundation to undertake projects of a fundamental or general nature that may produce new insights, knowledge, or techniques applicable to information systems and services. <ref> [6] </ref> The projects supported at this time were featured in the semiannual reports on Current Research and Development in Scientific Documentation. [30] During those early days, a number of conferences were sponsored by the NSF to chart a plan for research activities in the field of scientific documentation. <p> Agencies such as the Ford Foundation as well as the American Society of Metals initiated and supported many studies of library problems. <ref> [6] </ref> There is a general consensus among those doing research on scientific documentation at that time that "the 1960s were really a good time for IR research." In the 1970s, the significance of the area was further emphasized at the NSF by the establishment of, for example, the Division for Information

Reference-contexts: Appendix A.4 identifies emerging technologies that are relevant to the information industry. 1.1 Further Background In 1945, Vannevar Bush, President Roosevelt's science advisor, who played a key role in the development of the National Science Foundation, wrote of the need to develop and use tools to manage mankind's accumulated knowledge. <ref> [7] </ref> Although Bush's `memex' idea didn't turn out to be of much practical value, his vision inspired many researchers in the areas of information retrieval, information science, and hypertext. As a result, in part, of his insight, the first text retrieval systems were developed in the 1950s.

Reference-contexts: In fact, highly significant theoretical advances were made in the context of probabilistic retrieval models and linear retrieval models. ([48, 33], <ref> [9] </ref>: pp 30-35) The results in this area formally establish the conditions under which a retrieval system can achieve optimal, in some precise sense, performance. d) A significant achievement, in conjunction with the work on vector processing systems, is the development of evaluation measures and methodology. <p> The University of Nevada at Las Vegas has been 13 funded to create a National Testbed, consisting of large amounts of text in ASCII and image formats, for investigating text capture and retrieval technologies. (<ref> [9] </ref>: pp 99-105, [9]: pp 143-146) 3.4 Intelligent and NLP-based Systems There are several points of view regarding the relationship between intelligent systems and IR systems. First, there is the view considering incorporating various kinds of knowledge into IR systems. <p> an integral part of the document indexing process? Should they be constructed manually or through some automatic procedure? Do we know how to effectively use them for retrieval [17] or for indexing? Some of these questions have been studied in the context of the MEDLINE database and MeSH thesaurus. ([27], <ref> [9] </ref>: pp 132-139) b) A number of studies have investigated the applications of NLP to IR. [41] It is important to recognize the close coordination that must be present between the indexing and search formulation stages. In this context, the UMLS project at NLM is an important step.

Reference-contexts: Such a multilevel indexing and analysis strategy has led to successful encyclopedia searching schemes. ([9]: pp 23-29) e) While most investigations with machine readable text have focussed on searching, researchers at Bellcore also considered the effects of electronic resources on reading. The SuperBook project <ref> [10] </ref> developed a full-text based search interface that can be used for reading an electronic text.

We, therefore, highlight not only accomplishments that are directly concerned with the discipline of information retrieval <ref> [36] </ref>, but also several activities in related areas that significantly impact IR research. During the 1960s and the early 1970s, the problem of meeting user information needs was handled by means of the, so called, Boolean retrieval model. <p> The research findings on clustering and indirect searching, mentioned in Section 3.1, are applicable for decisions concerning content-based links. <ref> [36] </ref> d) Researchers have also looked into the notion of document components.

Reference-contexts: Several new results addressing these issues have appeared. [2] Another aspect of evaluation that took on greater importance is the evaluation of operational, online systems. <ref> [38] </ref> The needs in this context have been shown to be different from those used in experimental systems. [3] c) A number of studies have provided ways to build integrated systems that manage text as well as formatted data.

VLDB conference, </booktitle> <address> Mexico City, </address> <pages> pp 197-207, </pages> <year> 1982. </year> <month> 29 </month>
Reference-contexts: The approaches have varied from simply viewing bibliographic retrieval as an application system of a relational DBMS, to extending the functionality of existing DBMSs, to developing hybrid systems that integrate several existing systems. <ref> [28, 39, 25] </ref> d) Not only can information sources differ in terms of the IR systems in which they reside, but they may also be in different media. The work in multimedia systems [14] are highly significant in providing access to information stored in different media.

Reference-contexts: automatic procedure? Do we know how to effectively use them for retrieval [17] or for indexing? Some of these questions have been studied in the context of the MEDLINE database and MeSH thesaurus. ([27], [9]: pp 132-139) b) A number of studies have investigated the applications of NLP to IR. <ref> [41] </ref> It is important to recognize the close coordination that must be present between the indexing and search formulation stages.

Reference-contexts: Retrieval software developed by Thinking Machines Corp., to run on their Connection Machine, provides the capability for efficiently searching very large text collections and includes mechanisms for relevance feedback. The Dow Quest service of Dow Jones is provided through this retrieval system. <ref> [42] </ref> c) Hypertext technology is revolutionizing the way in which text will be authored, read and searched. <p> For example, simple relevance feedback techniques that were provided in the late sixties [34] have found their way into recently developed commercial systems <ref> [42] </ref>. Probabilistic mechanisms for relevance feedback have been investigated for almost two decades [48, 33] and many extensions to the basic work have since been made.

Reference-contexts: Humphrey, who then arranged for the subcommittee of Senate Committee on Government Operations that he chaired to hold hearings on this topic. <ref> [44] </ref> An NSF sponsored conference, held in Washington, D.C. (October 2-3, 1964), was intended to encourage research on Evaluation of Document Searching Systems and Procedures. Active research programs at the Chemical Abstracts Service and the American Society of Physics were supported in large part by the NSF.

Reference-contexts: In particular, ideas pertaining to the construction of recall-precision graphs, interpolation of these graphs and averaging performance over many queries were developed. Also important are evaluation strategies in the context of relevance feedback. <ref> [34, 45] </ref> 3.2 Extended Boolean Systems Vector processing systems have had a major role in the development of a rigorous foundation for IR. However, acceptance by commercial vendors of retrieval systems has been limited.
