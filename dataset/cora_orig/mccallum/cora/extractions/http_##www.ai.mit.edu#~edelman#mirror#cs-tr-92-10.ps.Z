Abstract: Human performance in the recognition of 3D objects, as measured by response times and error rates, frequently depends on the orientation of the object with respect to the observer. We investigated the dependence of response time (RT) and error rate (ER) on stimulus orientation for a class of random wire-like objects. First, we found no evidence for universally valid canonical views: the best view according to one subject's data was often hardly recognized by other subjects. Second, a subject by subject analysis showed that the RT/ER scores were not linearly dependent on the shortest angular distance in 3D to the best view, as predicted by the mental rotation theories of recognition. Rather, the performance was significantly correlated with an image-plane feature by feature deformation distance between the presented view and the best (shortest-RT and lowest-ER) view. Our results suggest that measurement of image-plane similarity to a few (subject-specific) feature patterns is a better model than mental rotation for the mechanism used by the human visual system to recognize objects across changes in their 3D orientation.

Reference-contexts: Recently, it was found that distance to the closest familiar view is a good predictor of recognition rate, and that the dependence of performance on this distance agrees qualitatively with the predictions of a computational model of recognition based on interpolation among multiple stored views <ref> (Bulthoff and Edelman, 1992) </ref>. This finding suggests that a quantitative comparison between the predictions of different models and human performance is necessary. <p> For instance, if the target was spatially "spread out," no "contracted" nontargets were used. However, the nontargets were always clearly distinguishable from the target. 6 negative error rate significantly exceeded the false positive error rates <ref> (cf. Edelman and Bulthoff, 1992) </ref>. The average correct recognition rate, for all sessions was about 60% for the target and 75% for the nontarget images, that is a 40% false negative and a 25% false positive average error rate.

Reference-contexts: Results of a recent study indicate that certain views are significantly better than the others even for "balanced" synthetic objects which look statistically the same from all viewpoints, and which are shown to the subjects equally often from all the viewpoints involved in the experiment <ref> (Edelman and Bulthoff, 1992b) </ref>. The next step in this direction would be to find out whether the canonical views that arise in this case are as prominent and consistent across subjects as in the original study of Palmer et al. (1981). <p> This simple procedure allowed fast generation of geometrically balanced random objects. Two other constraints intended to eliminate viewpoint independent features such as sharp angles, and nearly intersecting or parallel tubes were also implemented. 2.2 Experimental design A 1-Interval Forced Choice paradigm, as in <ref> (Edelman and Bulthoff, 1992b) </ref>, was employed. The experiments consisted of a training phase immediately followed by a testing phase. Two main categories of experiments were conducted. In the recognition memory experiments, the test views were always a subset of the set of training views. <p> Still, ER is to be preferred over RT in analyzing data from an experiment with multiple exposures per condition, because the RTs in recognition tend to become uniform with practice, whereas ERs remain stable, if the subjects receive no feedback <ref> (Edelman and Bulthoff, 1992b) </ref>. Moreover, ER may be a more reliable measure of performance than RT, because the latter is affected by variability of the motor component of the response, to which ER is in principle less sensitive. On the other hand, RTs can only be averaged over correct-response trials.

Reference-contexts: The visual system appears to find some kinds of transformations easier to compensate for than others. Scaling, for example, is especially easy in this respect. The apparent size of objects does not affect their recognition rate, even though it may influence the response time in a transitory fashion <ref> (Larsen, 1985) </ref>. Similarly, rotation around line of sight influences only the response time, and this influence tends to diminish with practice (Jolicoeur, 1985; Tarr and Pinker, 1989).

According to this model, the greater the total similarity between the current view and the stored views, the more readily the current view is recognized. The weights in the formula allow for different saliencies of the stored views and can be estimated by linear regression.

Reference-contexts: This additional processing cost is reflected in longer response times and in higher error rates evoked by randomly chosen views of the object, as compared to certain so-called canonical views <ref> (Palmer, Rosch and Chase, 1981) </ref>. 1 1 Obviously, if there is any variation at all in recognition performance across viewpoints, some views will be "better" than others. <p> The original notion of canonicality due to <ref> (Palmer et al., 1981) </ref> was formulated in general, shape-independent terms such as visible area, familiarity, etc. In comparison, we find that a view is rendered canonical by the presence of certain concrete and salient features, which are visible, more or less deformed, over a range of viewpoints.

Reference-contexts: Models that belong to the first class rely on viewpoint-specific 3D object representations. Naturally, for such models the idea of canonical orientation is of central importance. Consider as an example recognition by alignment (Ullman, 1989). The basic idea of the multiple views plus transformation version of alignment, proposed in <ref> (Tarr and Pinker, 1989) </ref>, is to store the 3D model of the object at the canonical orientations, and when presented with a random view of an object to apply an appropriate transformation (rotation) in an attempt to bring the input object into register with the model.

Reference-contexts: In the following, we consider two classes of such models. Models that belong to the first class rely on viewpoint-specific 3D object representations. Naturally, for such models the idea of canonical orientation is of central importance. Consider as an example recognition by alignment <ref> (Ullman, 1989) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Examples of this class include recognition by linear combination of views <ref> (Ullman and Basri, 1991) </ref>, and the various multiple-view interpolation models (Poggio and Edelman, 1990; Edelman and Weinshall, 1991). <p> Recent developments in computer vision indicate that this distinction may be unwarranted, because a set of properly chosen views of an object, along with feature correspondence information, is computationally equivalent to having a 3D model of the object at one's disposal <ref> (Ullman and Basri, 1991) </ref>. We would like to point out that those two apparent extremes also share an important conceptual trait: both the 3D model and the multiple-views model ascribe certain perceptual realism to the representation.
