Abstract: Corporate databases increasingly are being viewed as potentially rich sources of new and valuable knowledge. Various approaches to"discovering" or "mining" such knowledge have been proposed. Here we identify an important and previously ignored discovery task, which we call data archaeology. Data archaeology is a skilled human task, in which the knowledge sought depends on the goals of the analyst, cannot be specified in advance, and emerges only through an iterative process of data segmentation and analysis. We describe a system that supports the data archaeologist with a natural, object-oriented representation of an application domain, a powerful query language and database translation routines, and an easy-to-use and flexible user interface that supports interactive exploration. A formal knowledge representation system provides the core technology that facilitates database integration, querying, and the reuse of queries and query results.

This work uses either statistical methods or statistically-oriented machine learning algorithms to extract dependencies or correlations from data.

Reference-contexts: However, some elements of the commercial market are moving in the direction of supporting more interactive and customized access. For example, Anand and Kahn's SPOTLIGHT system <ref> [3, 4] </ref> supports the process of data abstraction. It enables customers to understand and extract "significant" shifts among product segments and possible causes of these shifts in a large database of point-of-sale scanner data.

Reference-contexts: This contrasts with IMACS, where both the notion of a hypothesis is much richer, and analysis follows more of top-down flow as the initial, and quite detailed, domain model gets investigated and elaborated through segmentations captured in the knowledge representation. Anwar, Navathe and Beck <ref> [5, 6] </ref> describe an approach to knowledge discovery where new classes are formed over a set of existing instances in multiple relational databases. The scheme uses both the multiple relational schemas and the data instances to integrate them into a single knowledge representation (using the CAN-DIDE data model [7]).

What they call "attribute-based purpose-directed conceptual clustering" is used to generate the new classes based on similarity of values of the data instances. This process is automatic, but a clustering seed can be varied to take into account different user views.

Reference-contexts: Integration with Statistical and Knowledge Discovery Techniques One obvious set of extensions to the IMACS system is to integrate automated machine learning and statistical techniques. We intend to integrate S, a powerful statistical package <ref> [8] </ref>, into IMACS to allow further, and much more detailed, statistical examination of segments or stored classes. Second, we will add several machine learning techniques as well, allowing the user to "turn on" data mining on a subset of the knowledge base, somewhat in the flavor of [17]. 6.3.3.

Reference-contexts: To facilitate translation in a general way, we have developed a table-driven translation mechanism that allows a user to fill in a form specifying the mapping from relations to Classic. The mechanism then does all the tedious work of translating fields and values <ref> [10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In our current application, the data comes from several databases; thus, we also are using KR as a common data description language to integrate data from multiple databases. We use the KR system Classic <ref> [11, 13] </ref>. Classic is a frame-based knowledge representation language of the KL-ONE family [15].
