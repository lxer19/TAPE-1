At the first stage inverse discrete Fourier transform and a window function are used to arrive at a good, possibly nonanalytic (i.e., unstable) approximation to the given frequency response data.

Here we establish conditions for the robust convergence of the two-stage nonlinear algorithm. These conditions are given in terms of properties of the Fourier transform of the window function. <p> It turns out that in order to have a solution to this problem, we need to make some boundedness assumption on the set S of all possible systems. This implies a certain minimal amount of a priori information on the unknown system. This assumption is called admissibility in <ref> [5] </ref> and described below.

Definition 2.3 Stage 1 of the two-stage algorithm is said to be convergent if lim N;n!1 pi (S; *) = 0: (2.12) where e N n E;N o The two-stage algorithm is called robustly convergent (and untuned) if it is convergent and does not depend on S and *. <p> Moreover e N (S; *) 2e N The above bound was implicitly used in [6] to derive robustly convergent algorithm based on linear spline approximation, and a proof of the above lemma can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. To analyze the identification error e N pi (*) in Stage 1, we follow the procedure developed in [5] and write ~ h N (k) in (2.8) as where h N (k) = N i=0 1 N1 X ^ i+1 e jk (2i=N) : (2.16) The pre-identified model in Stage <p> 2e N The above bound was implicitly used in [6] to derive robustly convergent algorithm based on linear spline approximation, and a proof of the above lemma can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. To analyze the identification error e N pi (*) in Stage 1, we follow the procedure developed in [5] and write ~ h N (k) in (2.8) as where h N (k) = N i=0 1 N1 X ^ i+1 e jk (2i=N) : (2.16) The pre-identified model in Stage 1 of the nonlinear algorithm can thus be written as ^ h pi = ^ h N pi (2.17) <p> Hence, ^ h N pi can be thought of as a pre-identified model in Stage 1 for noise free case and ^ N pi as that due to noise. The following lemma is also taken from <ref> [5] </ref>. 5 Lemma 2.5 Stage 1 of the identification algorithm is robustly convergent if and only if (i) lim N;n!1 e noise N (*) := lim N;n!1 n pi k 1 : ^ 2 B N (*) = 0; N;n!1 app N;n!1 n pi ^ hk 1 : ^ h 2 <p> Since the set S is nontrivial, the robust convergence of the first stage implies that for each k 0, lim n!1 w n;k = 1: (See also the proof of Proposition (3.5) in <ref> [5] </ref>.) Now taking limit N &gt; 2n ! 1 in equation (3.4), we get that the condition 1 is true. To prove necessity of the condition 2, set ^ h = 0 in (3.2). We will assume that N is an even positive integer. <p> Remark 3.2 If we compare Theorem 3.1 with Theorem 3.3 in <ref> [5] </ref>, it is not difficult to see that the condition 1 of Theorem 3.1 is equivalent to conditions (i) and (iii) of Theorem 3.3 in [5]. However, the condition 2 here is weaker than the condition (ii) in [5] in general. <p> Remark 3.2 If we compare Theorem 3.1 with Theorem 3.3 in <ref> [5] </ref>, it is not difficult to see that the condition 1 of Theorem 3.1 is equivalent to conditions (i) and (iii) of Theorem 3.3 in [5].

However, the condition 2 here is weaker than the condition (ii) in [5] in general. <p> i.e., w n;k = w n;k , and w n;n = 0, then the following inequality can be shown M w sup njw n;n1 j + k=0 ) where M w is as in condition 2 while the right hand side is from the condition (ii) of Theorem 3.3 in <ref> [5] </ref> and denotes difference operator. In Theorem 3.3 of [5], condition (ii) requires that the right hand side of (3.15) be finite. <p> n;n = 0, then the following inequality can be shown M w sup njw n;n1 j + k=0 ) where M w is as in condition 2 while the right hand side is from the condition (ii) of Theorem 3.3 in <ref> [5] </ref> and denotes difference operator. In Theorem 3.3 of [5], condition (ii) requires that the right hand side of (3.15) be finite. <p> We would like to point out that although the conditions in Theorem 3.1 are necessary and sufficient, it is difficult to compute the upper bound M w as in condition 2 above, except some special cases which is contrast to the time domain conditions as in <ref> [5] </ref> where error bounds can be easily established for many commonly used window functions.

We begin with the triangular window t n;k = 1 n This window function is analyzed in [4] to study the convergence of the Cesaro mean based two-stage nonlinear algorithm for identification in H 1 . <p> Although the trapezoidal window does not satisfy the even symmetry property, the shifted window w n;k = a n;km does and Theorem 3.1 still applies to the trapezoidal window (see also <ref> [5] </ref>). It is shown in [5] that with the above window, the worst case noise error e N (^) as defined in Lemma 2.5 is bounded by e noise N n + m Using the result in Theorem 3.1, we obtain Corollary 3.4 Let the window function be given as in <p> Although the trapezoidal window does not satisfy the even symmetry property, the shifted window w n;k = a n;km does and Theorem 3.1 still applies to the trapezoidal window (see also <ref> [5] </ref>). It is shown in [5] that with the above window, the worst case noise error e N (^) as defined in Lemma 2.5 is bounded by e noise N n + m Using the result in Theorem 3.1, we obtain Corollary 3.4 Let the window function be given as in (3.19) with m &lt; n <p> Then the worst case noise error as defined in Lemma 2.5 can be bounded by e noise N * n + m : (3.21) (It is noted that the above bound is strictly smaller than the one as reported in <ref> [5] </ref> if n &gt; m). Proof: Since the worst case noise error as defined in Lemma 2.5 is shift invariant, we need only to consider following window function w n;k = a n;km (3.22) which is even-symmetric with respect to k.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction An abstract framework for worst case system identification has been recently developed by Helmicki, Jacobson, and Nett in [9]. A concrete problem which is a specific instance of this abstract framework is known as system identification in H 1 <ref> [6] </ref>. A conceptual description of this problem is as follows.

Roughly speaking, in the first stage, one finds a good possibly unstable approximation to the given frequency response data, and in the second stage Nehari theorem is used to find the fl Supported in part by National Science Foundation under grants no. <p> And the sufficient condition is imposed on the window function.

We analyze the performance of the identification algorithm in terms of the Fourier transform of the aforementioned window function. <p> In particular, if the system is ` 1 BIBO-stable, then its transfer function belongs to A. Transfer functions and Z-transform are defined such that stability corresponds to having no poles insider the unit disc. The problem of identification in H 1 formulated by Helmicki, Jacobson and Nett <ref> [6] </ref> can be briefly described as follows. Assume: that the "true" unknown system to be identified is a stable, linear, shift invariant discrete-time system with transfer function ^ h 2 S A. <p> As mentioned in the introduction, several robustly convergent nonlinear algorithms have been proposed in <ref> [6, 4, 23, 24] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These algorithms share the following "two-stage" structure. At the first stage inverse discrete Fourier transform and a window function are used to arrive at a good, possibly nonanalytic (i.e., unstable) approximation to the given frequency response data. Then in the second stage, Nehari's theorem <ref> [2, 21] </ref> is used to approximate this first stage approximation to obtain an analytic, i.e., stable, identified model.

Reference-contexts: Stage 2 involves solving an optimization problem to arrive at the identified model. This optimization problem is quite well known and is called the Nehari best approximation problem. There are many techniques for solving this problem. The book by Young <ref> [30] </ref> contains a nice expository treatment of this problem. The two-stage identification algorithm does not depend on S or the noise bound *.
