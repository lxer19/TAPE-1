Abstract: The problem of driving an autonomous vehicle in normal traffic engages many areas of AI research and has substantial economic significance. We describe work in progress on a new approach to this problem that uses a decision-theoretic architecture using dynamic probabilistic networks. The architecture provides a sound solution to the problems of sensor noise, sensor failure, and uncertainty about the behavior of other vehicles and about the effects of one's own actions. We report on advances in the theory of inference and decision making in dynamic, partially observable domains. Our approach has been implemented in a simulation system, and the autonomous vehicle successfully negotiates a variety of difficult situations.

The first phase of the project is a feasibility study to establish the computational and sensing requirements for driving and to investigate the nature of the necessary decision algorithms.

Reference-contexts: To address these issues, we have developed two methods for efficient rollup: temporally invariant networks and stochastic simulation. We first introduce the temporally invariant network, and then briefly describe our approach to stochas is altered after rollup. tic simulation in DPNs, which is described in more detail in <ref> [ Kanazawa et al., 1995 ] </ref> . Temporally Invariant Networks A temporally invariant network is a DPN for which there exists a node elimination sequence which induces the same structure as the original network. Figure 3 (a) shows a temporally invariant network. <p> This is related to genetic algorithms (except that there is no crossover). Our experimental results confirm that our methods perform better than likelihood weighting in DPN-monitoring applications. The best results are obtained by combining both methods <ref> [ Kanazawa et al., 1995 ] </ref> . 2.3 Network structure As implemented, the BAT monitors each vehicle tracked by the sensor system with a separate DPN.

Reference-contexts: In general, the model for the current time slice along with the current percepts completely determines the current belief state. Clearly, real-time temporal inference requires efficient rollup. Any exact method for rolling up one slice of a network is equivalent to performing a sequence of node eliminations <ref> [ Kjaerulff, 1992 ] </ref> . Node elimination may introduce additional links into the network; thus the network structure may change as a result of rollup. This complicates maintaining the belief state in three ways. First, different node elimination sequences can result in drastically different connectivity in the resulting networks.

Reference-contexts: Each leaf of the tree is a decision. This obviously yields an effective, real-time policy, but constructing the decision tree is a difficult task. Other researchers, for example Lehner and Sadigh <ref> [ Lehner and Sadigh, 1993 ] </ref> , have examined the creation of decision trees from influence diagrams, but only for static problems. In such cases, the decision tree nodes test fully determined evidence variables.

Reference-contexts: One exception is the work of Niehaus and Sten-gel <ref> [ Niehaus and Stengel, 1991 ] </ref> , who have recently incorporated a somewhat ad hoc form of probabilistic reasoning into their rule-based driving controller. Since their system assumes worst-case outcomes in looking ahead, and does not integrate percepts over time in assessing the current state, its performance is limited.

Reference-contexts: Probabilistic networks are directed acyclic graphs in which nodes represent random variables (typically discrete) and arcs represent causal connections among the variables <ref> [ Pearl, 1988 ] </ref> . Associated with each node is a CPT (conditional probability table) that provides conditional probabilities of the node's possible states given each possible state of its parents (or the prior probabilities if the node has no parents). <p> When specific values are observed for some of the nodes in a probabilistic network, posterior probability distributions can be computed efficiently for any of the other nodes using a variety of inference algorithms <ref> [ Pearl, 1988 ] </ref> . The extension to continuous variables is straightforward, and stochastic sampling provides a simple way to perform inference with such variables.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, much remains to be done. We are currently investigating the application of new learning algorithms to construct DPNs automatically from time series data <ref> [ Russell et al., 1995 ] </ref> . Combined with our computer vision subsystem, this will allow the construction of human driver models from videotapes. In our network representation, we are working to incorporate continuous variables, thereby avoiding the combinatorial explosion caused by discretization.

Reference-contexts: Because logic sampling discards trials whenever a variable instantiation conflicts with observed evidence, it is ineffective for DPN-based monitoring where evidence is observed throughout the temporal sequence. Likelihood weighting <ref> [ Shachter and Peot, 1989 ] </ref> attempts to overcome the general problem with logic sampling. Rather than discarding trials that conflict with evidence, each trial is weighted by the probability it assigns to the observed evidence.

Reference-contexts: Instead, we enforce the convention that a decision at time t is made with all evidence gained up to and including time t, and we identify a particular set of the chance nodes as evidence nodes that will be instantiated at each time step. Tatman and Shachter <ref> [ Tatman and Shachter, 1990 ] </ref> provide an algorithm for computing the policy for a DDN. In the case of driving, which is a partially observable problem, only a subset of the variables in a given time slice will be instantiated as evidence.
