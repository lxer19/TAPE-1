Reference-contexts: All computations take place in the ring D generated by the coefficients of the polynomials in P: By the complexity of our algorithms we mean the number of arithmetic operations (additions, multiplications and sign determinations) in the ring D: Note that this ignores the cost of reading the input (see <ref> [2] </ref>, section 1.3, page 1004, for further details). For the past twenty years many researchers have sought and found algorithms to compute various topological properties of semi-algebraic sets. <p> Moreover, this is the number of polynomials in L: We use the sample points subroutine of <ref> [2] </ref> (which has complexity S k+1 D O (k) where S is the number of polynomials in L and D a bound on their degrees) to compute a set of points meeting every semi-algebraically connected component of every non-empty sign condition on L. <p> sign condition of the original family P corresponds to a semi-algebraically connected component (say C 0 ) of a weak sign condition on P fl : Moreover, C = C 0 " R k : Thus, we can now get rid of the infinitesimals using the same technique as in <ref> [2] </ref> (section 6.2, page 1043). The complexity of the algorithm is easily seen to be bounded by s k+1 d O (k 3 ) : This proves Theorem 3.
