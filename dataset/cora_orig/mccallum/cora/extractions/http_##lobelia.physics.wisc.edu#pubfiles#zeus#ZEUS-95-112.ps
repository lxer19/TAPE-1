Abstract: Since there are no F L measurements in the ZEUS kinematic range, the uncertainty in F L is its full range, i.e., 0 F L F 2 . The uncertainty that is induced due to this F L uncertainty in calculating F 2 and dF 2 d log Q 2 from the differential cross section is damped by the appearance of kinematic terms y 2 =Y + in the cross section formula. This uncertainty is explored as a function of kinematic variables in ZEUS kinematic range. i where ff is the fine structure constant, Q 2 is the invariant four-momentum transfer squared of the virtual photon, and x is the longitudinal momentum carried by the struck parton in the proton. The kinematic variables, y which represents the fractional energy transfer from electron to the hadron system, and, Y + (y), are defined as y = Q 2 =(sx) and Y + (y) = 1 + (1 y) 2 . One can view this process as due to absorption of virtual photons which are polarized either transversely or longitudinally. The structure function F L is a measure of cross section due to absorption of longitudinal virtual photons only. In the naive parton model, the lack of transverse momentum of spin-1/2 partons and the conservation of Z component of angular momentum imply that the longitudinally polarized virtual photons cannot be absorbed in deep inelastic scattering, i.e., F L (x; Q 2 ) = 0. However, in more realistic models one expects that partons interact with one another and generate transverse momentum. In particular, at low x, i.e., when sampled partons carry a small fraction of proton longitudinal momentum, comparable in magnitude to their transverse momentum, there could be significant absorption of longitudinal photons. In fact, at very low x there is no reason why contribution to cross section due to the absorption of longitudinal
