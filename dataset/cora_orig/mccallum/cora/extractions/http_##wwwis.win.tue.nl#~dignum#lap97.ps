Abstract: In Computer Science, conceptual modelling and formalization are the basis for developing automated systems, "intelligent" or not. It is often taken for granted that formalization is possible and desirable. In the Language/Action perspective, this assumption has been challenged. The Language/Action perspective promotes "communicative action", in the sense of Habermas, as the building block of inter- and intraorganizational communication. In this paper, we want to discuss the issue of formalization from the broader perspective of rationalization. In this way, both the positive and negative sides of formalization can be more clearly seen. We illustrate this by means of examples from group support systems, workflow systems and software agents.

Reference-contexts: It has also been attested in numerous experiments that in terms of creativity, groups perform lower than the best member. Argyris has pointed out that people are often unaware of their defensive, and uneffective behaviour in groups <ref> [1] </ref>. The question then becomes how meetings can be conducted in such a way that these undesirable effects are minimized and the result is satisfactory rather than frustrating.

Reference-contexts: For Winograd and Flores, formal models are associated with a classical rationalistic view of cognition and at least suspicous, although they do not go as far as certain opponents who dismiss formalization completely [17]. However, there is also the work of Johannesson <ref> [2] </ref> and our own [5, 18], among others, in which formal logic is used to capture the semantics of communicative actions, and that places itself in the Language/Action tradition as well.

Reference-contexts: Participation, perhaps with the help of a coach, can also be an instrument in learning, in altering one person's interpretative framework <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> When the participants are made aware of this, it may reduce the number of counter-productive moves. Transparancy of commitments Quoting Winograd and Flores, Bennett emphasizes that "to be human is to be a kind of being that generates commitment, through speaking and listening" <ref> [3] </ref>. Commitments are not always clear. Rationalization of the meeting means, for one thing, that requests for commitments are transparant as well as the commitments of the responsible actor.

In <ref> [5] </ref>, we distinguished charity, authorization and power. The most secure is authorization, since power is not based on rationality and charity depends on the goodwill of the Addressee. Transparancy of authorization means that the requests made to participants during the meeting, are clearly authorized requests.

Reference-contexts: In recent years it was recognized that the coordination of tasks between agents is more than the transfer of information. Some effort has begun to define agent communication languages based on speech acts. The most well-known language is KQML <ref> [6] </ref>. Although this language is based on speech acts it is not based on the Language/Action Perspective. Although many performatives are incorporated in KQML the pre- and postconditions of the messages are unclear and certainly not equal to the ones in human communication.

Reference-contexts: However, the basic motivation for the use of EMR tools in group meetings is not the increase of efficiency, but the minimization of productivity losses. The tendency for groups to become less productive as group size increases is known in the social sciences as the Ringelmann effect <ref> [7] </ref>. It has also been attested in numerous experiments that in terms of creativity, groups perform lower than the best member. Argyris has pointed out that people are often unaware of their defensive, and uneffective behaviour in groups [1].

Reference-contexts: For Habermas, rationality also means that the participants are able to back up the validity claims that they raise. A method that supports structuring argumentations is IBIS and a tool that supports this method is gIBIS <ref> [9] </ref>. Such a tool could be extended so that normative, cognitive and expressive validity claims are clearly distinguished. Summarizing, we conclude that group meetings can be considered as communicative action, and that there are several possibilities for rationalization.

Reference-contexts: Of course, the other extreme should be avoided as well, where the only goal is to promote one's own personality. This would be a reduction to the expressive aspect of communication. Transparancy of conversation type Janson and Woo <ref> [10] </ref> compared different IS development methods from a speech act perspective. By looking at the kind of speech acts made by different participants users versus analysts -, one can detect different conversation types underlying the user-analyst meetings.

Reference-contexts: This will lead to a certain kind of formalizaton, for example, when a "to do" list is maintained, but this is formalization of the communication processes themselves, and not meant to replace communicative action. 4.2 Workflow Management Traditional workflow management systems can be seen as a form of burocracy (cf <ref> [12] </ref>). They support the coordination of activities through technological means. The main emphasis of these products lays on the logistic aspects of the workflow. A workflow is depicted in a similar way as the production process in a factory.

Reference-contexts: another pillar of the Language/Action Perspective, the philosophy of Habermas, that suggests a way of analyzing both the positive and the negative results of formalization by introducing the concept of rationalization. 3 Rationalization and communication 3.1 Rationalization processes Rationalization is a key concept in the philosophical work of Habermas ([8] <ref> [13] </ref> [4] [19]). <p> One could ask whether these two aspects go necessarily together. Now Habermas also discusses consensual action and conversational action as special kinds of communicative action (borderline cases) ([11]). In the case of consensual action, interaction takes place on the basis of an already achieved common definition of the situation <ref> [13] </ref>. This means that actions towards mutual understanding are no longer necessary, and what remains is only the coordination. An example is the communication in a surgery team.

Reference-contexts: In this situation the coordination of the activities can be determined largely through the organization structure ("burocracy", in terms of Habermas) and communication can be replaced by technology. There is one workflow system that deviates markedly from the traditional workflow systems: Action Workflow <ref> [14] </ref>. Action Workflow use the Language/Action paradigm as starting point to describe the coordination of activities within an organization. The main purpose of this tool is to make the commitments that persons make towards each other in an organization visible.

Reference-contexts: In the following, we will concentrate on electronic meeting rooms where the participants are together in the same room at the same time, although most conclusions will apply to the other cases as well. A well-known tool for EMR support is GroupSystems <ref> [15] </ref>. An EMR system does not try to replace the communication with technological means, but to provide support. An example is a brainstorming tool that allows parallel and anonymous input, and then presents the results to the group for discussion.

Reference-contexts: But whereas in Heidegger's (later) thinking, the human subject gradually disappears under the massive weight of Language and Being, the human responsible subject is central in Habermas' views. For Heidegger, truth is an anonymous process of unconcealment (cf. <ref> [20] </ref> p179), whereas for Habermas, it is a claim made by a speaker that he should defend against counter-arguments. 4 3.2 Rationalization and automation Let us now come to the question whether formalization (and automation) of communication processes is something to be pursued. <p> Meetings are a kind of communicative action that play an important role in coordinating the individual behaviours. Since it is through language that we give meaning to the world we live in and share with others <ref> [20] </ref> p78, we do need meetings in which speaking as well as active listening can create new (shared) spaces of possibilities. Participation, perhaps with the help of a coach, can also be an instrument in learning, in altering one person's interpretative framework [3].
