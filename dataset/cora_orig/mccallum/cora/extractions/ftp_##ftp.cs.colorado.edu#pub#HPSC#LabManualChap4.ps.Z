Title: Lab 4 Cray Y-MP Performance 4.1 Introduction  "Numerical Analysis Review" [Fosdick Jessup 95]. 4.2 Getting Started  
Note: The numerical background for the work in this chapter can be found in the  81  
Abstract: In this chapter, we study the performance of the Cray Y-MP. We measure the time it takes to perform basic scalar operations and vector operations. We use examples and exercises to relate these to matrix operations used in earlier chapters. You need to study the tutorial chapter on Vector Computing [Schauble 95b] and the document named Using The Cray Y-MP at NCAR [Schauble 95a] before you begin this chapter. The second tutorial provides information on the Cray Y-MP used in this course. It also tells you how to login and run programs on the Cray. It is important that you follow the directions given to obtain, complete, and submit a registration template for the Internet Remote Job Entry (IRJE) host, windom. This process takes a minimum of 24 hours and must be done before you are allowed to submit any batch jobs. The following example gives you some practice in moving a source file to the Cray, along with compiling, running, and retrieving results.
