Reference-contexts: Gigabit networks already exist in the research community and will soon be available for commercial use. The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) are funding several research efforts to study gigabit network issues in testbed environments (see <ref> [COMP90] </ref> for a summary of some of these efforts). 1.4 Re-Examination of Networking Issues Although the hardware technology currently exists to transmit raw bits at gigabit rates, many technical challenges remain. Traditional network protocols and software designs will have to be changed to accommodate gigabit transmission speeds.
