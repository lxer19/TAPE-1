Abstract: The objective of this research is to develop an efficient multilayer general area router as an alternative to the three-dimensional (3D) maze router for solving the multilayer MCM routing problem. Our router, named SLICE, is independent of net ordering, requires much shorter computation time, and uses fewer vias. A key step in our router is to compute a maximum non-crossing bipartite matching, which is solved optimally in O (n logn ) time where n is the number of possible connections. We tested our router on a number of examples, including two MCM designs from MCC. The total wirelength used by SLICE is only a few percent away from the optimal. Compared with a 3D maze router, SLICE is four times faster and uses 28% fewer vias. A more important feature is that SLICE works on only a "thin slice" of the two-layer routing grids at a time, while a 3D maze router works on the entire three dimensional routing grid. Therefore, SLICE can successfully produce solutions for large MCM routing examples where 3D maze routers fail due to insufficient memory.

Reference-contexts: Thus, each net is often forced to use many vias since it has to be routed within two layers. For high-performance MCMs, vias not only increase the manufacture cost but also degrade the system performance since they form inductive and capacitive discontinuities and cause signal reflections <ref> [Ba90] </ref>. Several efficient routers have been proposed for silicon-on-silicon based MCM technology [PrPC89, DaKJ90, DaDS91, DaKS91]. Since the number of routing layers is usually small in this technology, some techniques for IC routing, such as hierarchical routing and rubber-band routing, can be applied to yield good solutions.

Reference-contexts: In fact, it is commonly believed that the wirelength of a minimum Steiner tree for a multi-terminal net is at most 88% of the wirelength of a minimum spanning tree on average <ref> [BeCa87] </ref>, which leads to a new wirelength lower bound of 362497 for mcm1. The result by the SLICE router is only 10% more than the new lower bound. 4 The 3D maze router using the reserved layer model performed much better than the one using the un-reserved layer model.

Reference-contexts: First, MCMs may have far more interconnection layers than ICs. For example, the multi-chip module developed for the IBM 3081 mainframe has 33 layers of molybdenum conductors (including 1 bonding layer, 5 distribution layers, 16 interconnection layers, 8 voltage reference layers, and 3 power distribution layers <ref> [BlBa82, Bl83] </ref>). Fujitsu's latest supercomputer, the VP-2000, uses a ceramic substrate with over 50 interconnection layers [HaYY90]. Moreover, unlike routing in ICs where the routing region can be naturally decomposed into channels and switchboxes, there is no natural routing hierarchy in MCM routing.

Reference-contexts: Nets are first assigned to x-y layer pairs and then two-layer routing is carried out for each x-y layer pair (the x-layer runs horizontal wires and the y-layer runs vertical wires) <ref> [HoSV90] </ref>. Although this approach is efficient, it faces a few problems. First we have to pre-determine the number of the routing layers before we can carry out layer assignment. Moreover, the approach does not take advantage of the large number of routing layers.

Reference-contexts: Then the set of edges M in S is a maximum weighted non-crossing matching if and only if the corresponding points P (M ) form a maximum-chain in P (S ). The proofs of the results in this section can be found in <ref> [KhCo92] </ref>. A maximum-chain of a point set P can be computed as follows: We construct a direct graph G P , called the dominance graph, in which each node represents a point in P . <p> The dominance relations are shown in P (S ) as thin arrows The MWNCM in S , and the corresponding maximum-chain in P (S ) are shown as dotted arrows. the algorithm is given in <ref> [KhCo92] </ref>. Theorem 2: Given the set S of n edges between a column pair, the maximum weighted non-crossing matching can be computed in O (n logn ) time.

Reference-contexts: Vias may be stacked on top of each other to connect wires in nonadjacent layers. Stacked vias can be formed in several ways, e.g., by filling the etched via with nickel in the AT&T AVP process or by plating copper posts as in the MCC process <ref> [Sh91] </ref>. The output of the routing problem is a set of wire segments and vias that connect each net.
