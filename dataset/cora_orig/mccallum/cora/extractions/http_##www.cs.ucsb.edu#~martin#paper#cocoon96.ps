Title: On the Complexity of Commutativity Analysis

Abstract: Two operations commute if they generate the same result regardless of the order in which they execute. Commutativity is an important property | commuting operations enable significant optimizations in the fields of parallel computing, optimizing compilers, parallelizing compilers and database concurrency control. Algorithms that statically decide if operations commute can be an important component of systems in these fields because they enable the automatic application of these optimizations. In this paper we define the commutativity decision problem and establish its complexity for a variety of basic instructions and control constructs. Although deciding commutativity is, in general, undecidable or computationally intractable, we believe that efficient algorithms exist that can solve many of the cases that arise in practice.

Reference-contexts: If neither method writes an instance variable the other method either reads or writes, the method are independent. Clearly this algorithm can be implemented in polynomial time with respect to both the method's length and the number of instance variables using set representation techniques <ref> [1] </ref>. 4.3 Reduction A common operation in many applications is to reduce many values into one accumulator variable by applying a commutative and associative operator such as + or fl.

Reference-contexts: Despite this worst-case scenario we, do not expect the analysis to exhibit this exponential behavior in practice. Other research that uses related symbolic analysis techniques supports this hypothesis <ref> [6] </ref>. Straight-line Codes For straight-line codes the algorithm constructs the in-stance variable expressions by symbolically executing each statement. At each point in the program each variable is bound to an expression denoting its value at that point.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm builds the table by recursively traversing the outer conditional expressions to identify the minimal conjunctions of basic terms that select each maximal conditional-free subexpression as the value of the original expression. It is possible to further simplify the table using logic minimization techniques as proposed in <ref> [8] </ref>. To compare two expressions for equality the algorithm performs a simple recursive isomorphism test. The algorithm checks that the condition tables have the same indexes and that corresponding subexpressions in the table are isomorphic. Array Variables It is possible to integrate array variables in the symbolic execution framework.

Reference-contexts: Commutativity over zero input is polynomial-time decidable for C-programs with no nesting of loops, where t denotes a "forward" label not in the scope of any do-loop (do statements however can be labeled) <ref> [9] </ref>. 3.3 PSPACE-Hard Problems If in result #10 we allow "forward" labels to be inside the do-loops, then the problem becomes PSPACE-hard.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we focus on the theoretical aspects of commuta-tivity analysis. We identify classes of programs for which commutativity analysis is undecidable, PSPACE-hard, NP-hard, polynomial, and probabilistically polynomial-time decidable (see <ref> [10] </ref> for definitions and motivations). For some cases we also show the class of programs to be complete for the corresponding complexity class. The results presented here rely on known complexity results from the area of theoretical computer science. They serve two purposes.

Reference-contexts: The proofs are similar to the ones in <ref> [13] </ref> for proving the undecidability of program equivalence. Result #1. Let C = fx 1; x x + y; x x=yg and input domain D = Z. It is undecidable to determine, given a C-program P with three input variables and nine auxiliary variables, whether it commutes with ONE.

Reference-contexts: The lower bound holds even for five-variable programs <ref> [16] </ref>. If we replace x x + y and x x y by simpler constructs, we can show the following: Result #10. Let C = fx 0; x x + 1; x x 1; x y; if x = 0 then goto t; goto t; do x endg. <p> Commutativity with ONE over zero input is PSPACE-hard for C-programs with no nesting of loops.

Note that if C = fx 0; x x + 1; x x 1; x y; if x = 0 then y z; do x endg commutativity over zero input for C-programs with no nesting of loops is in PSPACE.

Reference-contexts: Result #12. Let C = fx 2x; x x=2; x x + yg and input domain D = Z. The commutativity problem for C-programs with one input variable and one auxiliary variable is NP-hard. The result also holds when x x+y is replaced by x x y <ref> [17] </ref>. Commutativity, nevertheless, is decidable. <p> It can be shown that the non-commutativity problem for C + -programs is in NP <ref> [17] </ref>. Thus commutativity can be decided in exponential time.
