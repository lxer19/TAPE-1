Abstract: it is slow if you follow that link further through that server. The icon on the bottom row indicates an error, for example the server is not reachable or file not found, etc. After a file is prefetched, the icon next to the corresponding link will be switched to a face wearing a hat with the same mouth shape. Figure 7 is an example screen which demonstrates how the icons work. Our prefetch program only handles the http protocol. In addition, images embedded in the page will generally not be prefetched except for image maps to save the bandwidth. The procedure of prefetching files is stopped immediately whenever a new request is issued by the user, except if the requested file is the one being prefetched. This may result in many files not being transmitted completely. One of the ongoing research efforts on http protocol [4] is to continue an interrupted transmission. If that is added in the http standard, we would be able to make better use of these partial documents. Prefetching is a technique which takes advantage of the idle time between user requests to download files so that delay can be reduced when a user requests these files later. To achieve high efficiency with prefetching, we have devised an algorithm to predict as accurately as possible the probability of a file being requested by the user in the near future. In addition, given the access probabilities of files and the system conditions, we determine which files should be prefetched to maximize the savings. We do this by deriving an upper bound for the prefetch threshold which is a function of system load, capacity and cost of a time unit and a system resource unit. Simulations show that in general using the access probabilities from the client can ensure that a large portion of prefetched files are used, while the access proba bilities from the server can help improve the number of user requests satisfied by the prefetched files.
