Reference-contexts: The comparison would be less dramatic if made against a uniprocessor with a hierarchical memory. Indeed, in the limiting technology, memory could be realized with access time ( p x) for the word with address x. In this model, 20 matrix multiplication would take time (p 3=2 log p) <ref> [ACS87] </ref>. In general, up to an O ( p p) factor in time could be gained in a mesh by minimizing the distance of references. Within the area-universal synchronous regions, the latency of individual references becomes less significant, as the distances are logarithmic.

Reference-contexts: The need for realistic models that would give the programmer a good sense of parallel program performance has motivated a number of proposals <ref> [S86, ACS89, V90a, Cetal92] </ref>. When developing such models, a tradeoff must be faced between accuracy of performance estimates (suggesting that all relevant features of the machine ought to be modelled) and portability (suggesting that only features common to all target machines ought to be modelled) [B89].

Reference-contexts: When developing such models, a tradeoff must be faced between accuracy of performance estimates (suggesting that all relevant features of the machine ought to be modelled) and portability (suggesting that only features common to all target machines ought to be modelled) <ref> [B89] </ref>. We predict that the constraints posed by physical limitations on machine structure will simplify the above problem considerably, by reducing the meaningful class of target machines. 9 Conclusions Technological progress in digital system engineering brings about a serious re-examination of the current models of parallel computing.

Reference-contexts: Despite the enabling technology, there is wide consensus, eloquently and authoritatively expressed [S86, V90a, V90b], that parallel computation has not enjoyed to this day the development that was to be reasonably expected, notwithstanding some remarkable realizations (see, e.g., <ref> [Be92] </ref>) that have appeared in the last few years.

Reference-contexts: The debate is open <ref> [BL85] </ref> on the minimum size of a digital device or on the minimum energy required by a logical operation. Although no definitive answer appears forthcoming, there is a consensus that a bounded volume can only store a bounded number of bits.

Reference-contexts: This relevance is striking when one considers that the duration of 1ns is already "long" for today's technology, and that in 1ns light travels a bare 30cm. Although signal propagation on electric conductors is frequently governed by slower processes (such as charging or discharging a capacitive load) <ref> [MC80, BPP82, CM85] </ref>, we shall assume that signal transmission time is proportional to the length of the connection, which, for sufficiently long wires [BPP82], is the best achievable performance. 2.

It is reasonable to make reference to a fixed technology, characterized by a minimum attainable value of the "feature" [MC80] of an integrated circuit. <p> the switching of a driving transistor) is followed by a propagation event, which takes place in a selected support medium, and whose duration is an increasing function of the source to destination distance (for example, charging the capacity of the wire connected to the input gate of a driven transistor <ref> [BPP82] </ref>.) In all cases, it appears that the duration ffi (delay) of a transmission event can be expressed as the sum of two terms: a constant set-up duration and a variable transmission time.

Reference-contexts: Several of the considerations and suggestions presented here do not entirely originate with this paper. They are an outgrowth of an intellectual climate to which an entire community of researchers has contributed over the years through both scholarly work and machine design. The pioneering work of Chazelle and Monier <ref> [CM85] </ref> raised severe objections to the synchronous hypothesis, and unequivocally pointed to the goal of laying "the foundation of a general theory of physical computability," which is also the focus of this paper. <p> This relevance is striking when one considers that the duration of 1ns is already "long" for today's technology, and that in 1ns light travels a bare 30cm.

Reference-contexts: The fundamental timing parameter is the largest execution time of such instructions. We assume here that a network of processors is programmed in a Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) mode <ref> [F66] </ref>. Specifically, all PE's execute the same program, but each PE has its own program counter. Although the communication primitives are restricted to adjacent PE's, addresses of instruction operands may range over the entire machine memory.

Reference-contexts: Quite recently Feldman and Shapiro <ref> [FS92] </ref>, alighting from fundamental physical constraints, propose as a realistic model of parallel computation a 3D-mesh-interconnection dubbed "spatial machine." Further developing these threads, in this paper we analyze how fundamental physical limitations appear to naturally lead to a scalable parallel computing structure in the form of a spatial mesh.

Reference-contexts: These results are remarkable and have already influenced the design of some commercial machines <ref> [Letal92] </ref>. In conclusion, we reach the view of an "asymptotically" large machine as a square mesh interconnection of small machines, each approximately of the size of the synchronous regions, exhibiting (in addition to the mesh structure) area-universal topologies.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the available area would be vastly underutilized by algorithms that can take more advantage of number of processors than they can do of bandwidth (e.g., consider systolic matrix multiplication). Motivated by considerations of the type developed in the above paragraph, Leiserson <ref> [Lei85] </ref> proposed the concept of area-universal network. Informally, an area-universal network is one that can route any collection of messages almost as efficiently as any other network with similar layout area. <p> This property is clearly desirable for a general-purpose computer, which at different times will have to execute algorithms with different communication requirements. However, a priori, the very existence of area-universal networks is not an obvious matter.

Reference-contexts: thus the simulation of a single step of the parallel system|which runs in time of the same order of the layout traversal time|runs in time comparable to the execution of the entire sequential algorithm. 13 This observation carries some implication with respect to the widely investigated parallel complexity class NC <ref> [P79] </ref>, which contains exactly those problems that can be solved in polylogarithmic time by a P-RAM with poly-nomially many processors. Membership in NC is often equated with parallel feasibility. Unfortunately, the correspondence is questionable in two ways.

Reference-contexts: Even postulating a rather implausible layout technology where the three dimensions have comparable lattices, we would only achieve a nonessential modification of the conclusions; typically, the replacement of square-roots with cubic-roots in some performance measures related to the physical diameter of the layout domain <ref> [Ros81] </ref>. Therefore, all space analyses will be expressed in terms of "area". These four limitations are the basis of the conclusions derived in the forthcoming sections.

Reference-contexts: For example, the hypercube and its derivatives, whose bisection bandwidth is linear (or slightly sublinear) in the number of nodes, have quadratic (or nearly quadratic) area <ref> [Tho80] </ref>. Hence, within the fixed areas of the synchronous regions, only a number of nodes proportional to (or slightly larger than) the square root of that area can be connected according to those topologies. <p> A number of subsequent investigations have been devoted to the subject [GL89, LM88, BB90, G90, BB93] with various findings. Exploiting the insights obtained over a decade of studies on the relation between bandwidth of networks and their layout area <ref> [Tho80, L81, V81, BL84, BP86] </ref>, some networks have been designed that can solve any instance of the routing problem by losing at most some logarithmic factors (typically two) against any other network of similar area (even one designed specifically for that instance).

Reference-contexts: A number of solutions to this problem have been proposed, based both on randomized and on deterministic algorithms <ref> [MV84, UW87, AHMP87, Ran87, KU88, HB88] </ref>. These schemes are collectively referred to as P-RAM simulations, and each of them is categorized on the basis of its slowdown, i.e., the number of network steps needed to simulate a P-RAM step (a global memory reference).

Reference-contexts: Despite the enabling technology, there is wide consensus, eloquently and authoritatively expressed <ref> [S86, V90a, V90b] </ref>, that parallel computation has not enjoyed to this day the development that was to be reasonably expected, notwithstanding some remarkable realizations (see, e.g., [Be92]) that have appeared in the last few years. <p> A major reason for this failed expectation has been convincingly identified <ref> [V90a] </ref> in the lack of an agreed-upon model of parallel computation, one that would unleash the independent development of hardware and software, the key feature of the extraordinary success of the von Neumann serial computer. <p> The need for realistic models that would give the programmer a good sense of parallel program performance has motivated a number of proposals <ref> [S86, ACS89, V90a, Cetal92] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Despite the enabling technology, there is wide consensus, eloquently and authoritatively expressed <ref> [S86, V90a, V90b] </ref>, that parallel computation has not enjoyed to this day the development that was to be reasonably expected, notwithstanding some remarkable realizations (see, e.g., [Be92]) that have appeared in the last few years. <p> Thus, in the topological model, the hypercube has the potential to achieve full latency hiding. Indeed, this potential is exploited in some schemes to simulate an (n log n)-processor P-RAM on an n-node hypercube, within O (log n) steps with high probability <ref> [V90b] </ref>. Such scheme, however, rests on a node-degree (log n), which is technically questionable as n grows. Taking now into consideration the speed-of-light limitation, we realize that the previous analysis of the mesh-interconnection remains valid (because transmission along an edge takes unit time in either model).

Reference-contexts: This view was naturally elicited by the early generations of computing systems, encompassed by the following eloquent characterization by Vitanyi <ref> [Vi86] </ref>: "a wire had magical properties of transmitting "instantly" from one place to another." It must be recognized that the synchronous model has been the basis of a number of significant results on size-time trade-offs, simulations between different topologies, achievable speed-ups, latency-hiding mechanisms, which adequately express its algorithmic capabilities.

Reference-contexts: The pioneering work of Chazelle and Monier [CM85] raised severe objections to the synchronous hypothesis, and unequivocally pointed to the goal of laying "the foundation of a general theory of physical computability," which is also the focus of this paper. Vitanyi <ref> [Vi88] </ref> established lower bounds to wire lengths in term of network diameter under very liberal assumptions, and suggested that "mesh-connected architectures may be the ultimate solution for interconnect 3 ing the extremely large computer complexes of the future," a conclusion fully endorsed by this paper. <p> Hence, we reach the central conclusion that the mesh of processor is scalable, substantiating the reported suggestion by Vitanyi <ref> [Vi88] </ref>. By contrast, the binary tree, the hypercube [P77], and the CCC [PV81] are not scalable. In the rest of this paper we shall adopt the mesh interconnection as the most suitable architecture in the limiting technology, and investigate its important features. Remark. <p> At first sight, this difficulty may be attributed to the width of the wires, since in standard layout arguments wires are responsible for the large area of high-bandwidth networks. However, an analogous, albeit weaker, lower bound on wire length holds for the hypercube even for hypothetical zero-width wires <ref> [Vi88] </ref>. On the other hand, the speed-of-light and device-size limitation jointly undermine the feasibility of latency hiding for any network in the limiting tech nology, even under the extreme assumption of zero-width links (which could model optical connections).
