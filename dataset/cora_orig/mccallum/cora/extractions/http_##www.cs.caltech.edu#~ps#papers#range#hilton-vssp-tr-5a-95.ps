Reference-contexts: Future development of the integration algorithm presented in this paper should focus on dynamic data integration and computational efficiency. Automatic reconstruction of an efficient representation with adaptive element size should also be investigated, <ref> [4] </ref>. 22 Further work on performance characterisation of algorithm implementations is re-quired to benchmark their relative computational costs and validate the limitations of existing algorithms identified in this paper. The objective of future algorithm development should be to address the issue of computational complexity.

Reference-contexts: The minimum feature size that can be reliably represented by the step 21 discontinuity constrained triangulation of the individual range images is nx, where n &gt; 2. The point-normal based implicit surface, Hoppe et al. <ref> [15] </ref>, fails to correctly reconstruct surface topology at boundaries, regions of high curvature and for different surfaces in close proximity. The mesh based implicit surface, presented in this paper, reliably reconstructs the surface geometry for features larger than the sampling resolution, nx.

Reference-contexts: Mesh zippering, Turk et al. [30], fails to reliably reconstruct the surface topology for small holes 2nx and regions of high curvature min = 90. In addition ambiguities may occur between overlapping meshes which cause the algorithm to fail to reconstruct a manifold surface. Mesh growing, Rutishauser et al. <ref> [22] </ref>, fails to reliably reconstruct the surface topology in regions of high curvature min = 90. 5 Conclusion A novel registered range image integration algorithm has been presented.

Reference-contexts: Ambiguities may result in projection of different surface regions to the same region in the 2D sub-plane. This must be explicitly incorporated into the algorithm by allowing multiple 3D surface values at grid points in the 2D sub-plane <ref> [23] </ref>. 4 Discussion A range image integration algorithm based on implicit surface polygonisation of triangulated meshes is presented. This approach avoids the limitations of previous implicit surface methods by using the local mesh continuity and an explicit boundary representation.

Reference-contexts: The mesh based implicit surface, presented in this paper, reliably reconstructs the surface geometry for features larger than the sampling resolution, nx. Canonic sub-view integration, Soucy et al. <ref> [24] </ref>, reliably reconstructs the surface topology of features larger than the sampling resolution, nx. The algorithm may fail if multiple surface regions are projected to the same region of the 2D canonic sub-view plane, limiting the minimum feature size to nx.

Reference-contexts: This eliminates any dependency on the relative sampling density of the individual range images. Method III implemements the nearest point search by projection and reparam-eterisation on a regular grid in the 2D sub-view plane. Measurement error is considered in evaluating the nearest point <ref> [26] </ref>. Mesh growing, method V, considers the K-nearest neighbours for overlapping meshes. This is robust to failure of the nearest point search due to the redundancy inherent in defining the K-neighbourhood. Hence, methods II, III and V are able to integrate range images with different sampling resolutions. <p> for M images of N points. * Limitations on surface geometry and topology are identified for all algorithms based on the range image sampling resolution. * Catastrophic failure modes are identified for several integration algorithms. * Two algorithms achieve reliable reconstruction of surface topology: Canonic sub-view integration, Soucy et al. <ref> [26] </ref>, and the mesh based implicit surface function introduced in this paper. Future development of the integration algorithm presented in this paper should focus on dynamic data integration and computational efficiency.

Reference-contexts: The computational complexity of integration algorithms are summarised in Table 1. The results demonstrate that the complexity of integrating M images of N points is approximately O (M 2 N ). The analysis indicates that the most efficient algorithm is the mesh zippering approach, <ref> [30] </ref>. This algorithm is relatively computationally efficient as operations are carried out at the mesh boundary only. Two additional factors contribute to the actual integration cost. Firstly, the cost depends on the particular range image data set. <p> This method allows dynamic integration of new data but requires the storage of 2 M1 1 intermediate canonic sub-views. Mesh zippering, Turk et al. <ref> [30] </ref>, fails to reliably reconstruct the surface topology for small holes 2nx and regions of high curvature min = 90. In addition ambiguities may occur between overlapping meshes which cause the algorithm to fail to reconstruct a manifold surface.
