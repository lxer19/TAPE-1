Reference-contexts: Since any given computation involves a fixed number of switching events, it dissipates a fixed amount of energy <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 Adiabatic Switching The adiabatic charging principle provides a way to charge capacitors through a resistance without dissipating the 1/ 2 CV 2 of energy. Consider figure 2, where we are charging a load capacitance through a switch.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, by dealing with real VLSI chips and real computer circuits, we have gained added insights into the energetics of computational processes such as information storage and erasure and combinational logic. Conventional CMOS digital circuits represent information as charges stored on capacitors <ref> [4] </ref>. They dissipate energy when actively computing, because changing the value of a bit of information requires converting the signal energy into heat. The idea of adiabatic switching is to instead recycle the signal energy, save it, and later reuse it to represent other information.

Reference-contexts: To discharge, we simply close S2 again, and let the charge drain off the output capacitors back into the power supply. This type of power supply is familiar to designers of resonant clock-driver circuits <ref> [5] </ref>. The energy dissipated during the charging and discharging is, up to a small numerical constant, (RC/T) times the signal energy, where T ~ (LC) is the charging time, and R is the resistance of the transmission gate when on.

Reference-contexts: In the limit of infinitely slow changes, the total dissipation is zero, and no heat is generated. Bennett has called computers based on this general principle Brownian Computers, so the devices we are building are practical instantiations of Brownian Computers <ref> [6, and references in 1] </ref>. We have developed a number of ways to build logic circuits that use adiabatic charging. They have in common the use of a three-valued logic: each signal can be true, false, or in a de-energized state.
