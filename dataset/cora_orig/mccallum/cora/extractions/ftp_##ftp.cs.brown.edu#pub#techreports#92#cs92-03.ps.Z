Reference-contexts: Thus, explanation is performed through a backward-chaining process on the causal knowledge base. Explanation (abduction) violates the logical rule of modus ponens since A =) B and B does not necessarily imply A which certainly creates various problems. <ref> [1, 4, 15, 16, 17, 5, 2, 9, 8] </ref>. Abduction has been formally defined as the process of searching for a set of hypotheses which can "best" prove the given observation/events. Obviously, an enormous number of such hypotheses sets may be available as proofs. <p> We choose only one such set which we "conclude" to be our "best" explanation. Thus, some ordering must have been imposed on these sets to make such a selection. Various models of abduction provide different approaches to the ordering problem. In particular, we consider the cost-based abduction model <ref> [1] </ref>, a minor variant of weighted abduction [4, 17]. We are given a causal knowledge base of propositional rules. A proposition which does not occur as the antecedent of any rule is called a hypothesis. Costs are then attached to these hypotheses to reflect the likelihood of assuming them true. <p> In this way, we build many partial proofs to use as guides for determining the least cost proof. Obviously, the construction of partial proofs serve as a heuristic in our search. However, it was shown that the search for a best explanation is NP-hard <ref> [1] </ref>. Introducing cyclicity further exacerbates the problem. Recently, Santos [11, 13, 12] showed that cost-based abduction can be reduced to linear constraint satisfaction. The search for the best explanation could now be done with the highly efficient tools and techniques long developed and understood in Operations Research. <p> Next, Section 3 discusses the problems of cyclicity and presents a new model we call generalized cost-based abduction. In Section 4, we present our linear constraint satisfaction formulation of the new abduction model completing our constrained optimization solution to cyclicity. 2 Constraint Systems The keystone of cost-based abduction <ref> [1] </ref> is the weighted and/ or directed acyclic graph (waodag) which models the causal relationships between objects and/or 3 Fig. 2.1. A simpler waodag. The and-node house-quiet is the observa-tion. <p> This proof also turns out to be the best explanation (minimal-cost proof) for Figure 2.1. As we mentioned earlier, finding the minimal-cost proof can be a difficult task. Using brute force enumeration techniques is fine for small problems but grows exponentially in complexity (Charniak and Shimony <ref> [1] </ref> have proven that this problem is NP-complete.) This problem can be straightforwardly transformed into 3 Although we have only discussed having costs associated with hypotheses, our approach permits costs to be associated with any node. 5 a graph search problem on and/or dags.

This was accomplished by studying cyclicity from the standpoint of linear constraint satisfaction which allowed us to concretely identify the problem.
