Abstract: To be effective in practice, concurrent engineering requires access to and organization of knowledge accumulated over time, product versions, and customers. More important, separate knowledge resources have to be shared and coordinated over space and time if successful design is to be accomplished. In this paper, we address the nature of communication in design, especially across disciplines, and the support systems that facilitate better communication. While a lot of research effort is being expended on same-time communications within a group, we consider, as well, the need for, and the problems associated with, different-time, different-place communication. We present these views in connection with an on-going development effort, n-dim.

Reference-contexts: Effective communication and coordination of work depends on such processes <ref> [1] </ref>. To reach consensus on a given issue, such processes should not, in general, be imposed from the outside but must, be, or have been, established by the design group itself. <p> perspectives that are be WET ICE, 1993, pp. 187-191 4 Subrahmanian et al.

Reference-contexts: Availability of high-speed communications and video technologies has relaxed the constraints on the participants to be in the same place while retaining much of the context of face-to-face communication <ref> [2] </ref>. However, same-time collaborations are limited in the number of participants that can effectively contribute and lack viable mechanisms for capturing, organizing and accessing design history. 3.1 Synchronicity and Asynchronicity: Tradeoffs Different-time and same-time collaboration are sometimes complementary in that one is strong where the other is weak.

Reference-contexts: In this sense, models can act as types for the creation of other models. Modeling languages are codifications of inter-relationships between information objects that are found useful throughout and beyond a current design situation. These languages can be used to codify formal and informal knowledge <ref> [7] </ref>. Languages for structuring formal knowledge can be used to code expressions, constraints, and production rules, that result in the specification of inference mechanisms. Informal languages can be used to annotate documents, drawings, and formal structures of knowledge. <p> Rather our aim is to present an an environment which we are currently testing and refining WET ICE, 1993, pp. 187-191 5 Subrahmanian et al.
