Abstract: In this paper we study the performance of an explicit rate allocation algorithm for ATM Networks using the available bit-rate (ABR) class of service. We examine the behavior of ABR traffic with simple cell sources, and demonstrate that the allocation algorithm is fair and maintains network efficiency in a variety of network configurations. We also study the behavior of TCP/IP sources using ABR service in a network of switches employing the rate allocation algorithm; the results show substantial improvements in fairness and efficiency in comparison with the performance of TCP on an underlying datagram-based network. Even in a dynamic network configuration with frequent opening and closing of ABR connections, TCP connections were able to make sustained progress with a switch buffer size as small as 1 Kbyte, providing an average link utilization of approximately 60% of the attainable maximum. We also study the performance of ABR traffic in the presence of higher-priority variable bit-rate (VBR) video traffic and show that the overall system achieves high utilization with modest queue sizes in the switches, and the ABR flows adapt to the available rate in a fairly short interval. Scalability of the ABR service is an important criterion. We demonstrate the scalability of the rate allocation algorithm with respect to the number of connections by increasing the number of active connections with very long round-trip times by a factor of 13; this caused only a three times increase in the switch queue size, while still maintaining maximal link utilization.

Reference-contexts: The VBR class of service is intended for real-time applications whose transmission rate is variable, and the service exploits statistical multiplexing to achieve efficient utilization of network resources. The Available-Bit-Rate (ABR) service class <ref> [1] </ref>, defined to support delay tolerant best-effort applications, uses rate-based feedback mechanisms to allow them to adjust their transmission rates to make full utilization of the available bandwidth [2]. Compliant connections are also assured of a low loss rate, and if needed, a minimum bandwidth allocation.

Compliant connections are also assured of a low loss rate, and if needed, a minimum bandwidth allocation. This class of service admits to the possibility of congestion, where the aggregate demand of the sources exceeds the capacity of the network resources. <p> Finally, Section 7 summarizes the results and proposes directions for future work. 2 Source and Switch Behavior We describe in this section the source and destination algorithms used in our study (the essential parts are a close approximation to the basic algorithms in the ATM Forum framework <ref> [2] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: With the explicit rate scheme, switches communicate in the RM cell, the amount of instantaneous bandwidth it can allocate to each connection to the source of the connection. The goal of the allocation is to arrive at an efficient allocation that is also max-min fair <ref> [3] </ref>. Each switch on the path of the RM cell may modify the request based on the bandwidth it is able to allocate to the connection on its outbound link.

Reference-contexts: On reaching its destination, the RM cell is returned to the source, which now sets its rate based on that allocated on the bottleneck link in the path of the connection.
