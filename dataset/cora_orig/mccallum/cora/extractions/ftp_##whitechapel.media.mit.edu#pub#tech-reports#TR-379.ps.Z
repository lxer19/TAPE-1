Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 379 Appears in Second International Workshop on Face and Gesture Recognition, Killington VT Oct. 1996 Abstract Ten different feature vectors are tested in a gesture recognition task which utilizes 3D data gathered in real-time from stereo video cameras, and HMMs for learning and recognition of gestures. Results indicate velocity features are superior to positional features, and partial rotational invariance is sufficient for good performance.

Reference-contexts: Yang style T'ai Chi movements are slow, smooth, and gentle. To capture the T'ai Chi movements in real-time we utilized a wide baseline stereo vision system developed by Azarbayejani and Pentland <ref> [1] </ref> which produces head and hand positions to an accuracy of approx. 2cm at up to 30 frames/sec. The several feature vectors derived from this data were input to Hidden Markov Model (HMM) recog-nizers, for which we used the HTK2.0 HMM toolkit from Entropic Research [13]. <p> The feature vector was then scored on its recognition rate. 5.1 Data Preprocessing The vision system returns time-stamped (x; y; z) for the head and left and right hands, gathered at a rate of 15-30Hz. The recovered trajectories have up to 2cm RMS error <ref> [1] </ref> and are not sampled uniformly in time. Hence we resampled it in time to a 30Hz sampling rate (using cubic splines) and low-pass filtered with a 3Hz cutoff before computing feature vectors.

The choice of T'ai Chi as a gesture set was motivated by its appropriateness for use in an application currently being developed by Becker and Pentland called Staying Alive <ref> [2] </ref>. Staying Alive is a virtual reality imagery and relaxation tool being built for cancer patients.

Reference-contexts: Schlenzig et al. [6] used HMMs to recognize gestures in sequences, using a rotation invariant representation of a binary image, processed through a neural net. Wilson and Bobick [10] incorporated multiple representations in an HMM framework, using eigen image weights as features. In a non-HMM approach Cui and Weng <ref> [3] </ref> used maximally discriminating (MDF) image weights as features, and a vector quantization of a low dimensional MDF space as a distance metric.
