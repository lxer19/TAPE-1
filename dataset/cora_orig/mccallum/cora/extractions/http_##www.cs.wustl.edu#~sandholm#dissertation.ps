Reference-contexts: Arrow's impossibility theorem states that there is no social choice rule that satisfies these four properties <ref> [ Arrow, 1963, Kreps, 1990, Ordeshook, 1986 ] </ref> . So to design social choice rules, the desiderata have to be relaxed. Commonly the first property is relaxed in the sense that the domain (combinations of individual preferences) on 51 which the rule works is restricted.

Reference-contexts: We will call a sequence of deliveries and payments safe if neither agent is motivated to defect at any point in the exchange. The basic idea of enhancing cooperation by making the present less important compared to the future has been suggested for example in <ref> [ Axelrod, 1984 ] </ref> . Also, Telser has analyzed safe exchanges of goods and payments in a setting that is similar to the one of this chapter [ Telser, 1980 ] . However, his work differs from the work of this chapter in many respects.

Reference-contexts: The Strong Nash equilibrium is often too strong a solution concept because in many games no such equilibria exist. 2.1.2.11 Coalition-Proof Nash Equilibrium Recently, the Coalition-Proof Nash equilibrium <ref> [ Bernheim et al., 1987, Bernheim and Whinston, 1987 ] </ref> solution concept for NFGs has been suggested as a partial remedy to the nonexistence problem of the Strong Nash equilibrium.

Reference-contexts: We suggest that contracts should also fulfill the condition of ex post rationality: abiding by the contract should be desirable to the agents at each step of the carrying out of the contract. Ex post conditions were studied in multiagent planning without side payments in <ref> [ Brainov, 1994 ] </ref> . 5.1 Unenforced Exchange of Goods and Payments Our model analyzes exchanging goods|information, computation services, or other types|for payments.

Reference-contexts: The value of an agent's action in the real world may decrease with time, thus necessitating a tradeoff between deliberating to find a good action and performing some action early 72 on. As an answer to the real-time requirements on AI, some research has focused on reactive systems <ref> [ Brooks, 1986 ] </ref> that provide the needed responsiveness but are often unable to solve complex problems adequately. One alternative between these two extremes is to have the agent dynamically trade off solution quality against computation time. This can be done e.g. by reasoning about reasoning, i.e. meta-reasoning.

Reference-contexts: Therefore no event verification mechanism is required either. This section of the dissertation presents formal justifications for adding this decommitment feature into a contracting protocol. Principles for assessing decommitment penalties have been studied in the economics of law <ref> [ Calamari and Perillo, 1977, Posner, 1977 ] </ref> , but the purpose has been to assess a penalty on the agent that has breached the contract after the breach has occurred.

Reference-contexts: In domains that are not BR subadditive, the BRC is sometimes empty. The condition C 6= ; can be converted into necessary and sufficient conditions on the v R S 's 174 in games where the grand coalition maximizes social welfare <ref> [ Shapley, 1967, Charnes and Kortanek, 1966 ] </ref> . We convert the condition BRC (c comp ) 6= ; into conditions on the v S (c comp )'s analogously. Let B 1 ; :::; B p be distinct, nonempty, proper subsets of A. <p> Shapley [ Shapley, 1967 ] proved the following fact (his Theorem 3) for rational agents. In a superadditive game, C 6= ; iff for every proper minimal balanced set B = fB 1 ; :::; B p g; P p B j v R A . Charnes and Kortanek <ref> [ Charnes and Kortanek, 1966 ] </ref> proved that this set of inequalities is minimal. Theorem 4.7 follows by analogy. 2 Proof. (Theorem 4.8).

Reference-contexts: The iterative market process of WALRAS differs from tatonnement. Specifically, WALRAS uses asynchronous declarations 64 by the agents, and the agents bid demand functions (of price) as opposed to just quantities. This process converges to a general equilibrium <ref> [ Cheng and Wellman, 1995 ] </ref> . As in tatonnement, trades in WALRAS only occur after the market process has terminated.

Reference-contexts: It cannot be redistributed into the society of agents. Thus, without an external benefactor, the mechanism as a whole cannot be Pareto efficient or social welfare maximizing. The Groves mechanism that minimizes this surplus tax revenue is called the Clarke tax mechanism <ref> [ Clarke, 1971 ] </ref> . Besides not being Pareto efficient, the Groves mechanisms are not coalition proof. Traditionally, the Clarke tax mechanism has been used to solve a single isolated social choice problem. In (AI) planning for multiple agents, this would mean voting over 53 all possible multiagent plans.

Reference-contexts: Also, the real world natural distribution of a scheduling problem seldom equals the distribution that would be computationally most efficient. Furthermore, parallel asynchronous search among agents often (yet not always <ref> [ Conry et al., 1991 ] </ref> ) involves giving up desirable algorithm properties such as completeness [ Sycara et al., 1991 ] . Another issue supporting distribution in cooperative settings is reactivity: agents can locally react to local changes faster than a centralized system could. <p> As discussed in Section 1.1.2, most work on distributed manufacturing scheduling also falls into the category of cooperative distributed problem solving. The CDPS approach has also been applied to other problems. In the multi-stage negotiation 70 protocol <ref> [ Conry et al., 1991 ] </ref> it was used to solve distributed constraint satisfaction problems where the agents did not have a global view, e.g. due to communication bandwidth limitations. The algorithm allows the identification of local decision that are disadvantageous from the global perspective, and it incorporates goal relaxation.

Reference-contexts: Three questions have to be answered to control single agent reasoning: which deliberation tasks to execute, in what order, and how much time to allocate to each one. This research can be divided according to two main criteria: interruptibility and number of reasoning tasks. In design-to-time algorithms <ref> [ D'Ambrosio, 1989, Garvey and Lesser, 1993 ] </ref> the meta-reasoner implicitly sets the run time and expected result quality by setting the reasoning algorithm parameters before execution.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, the role of decommitment possibilities among cooperative agents has been studied in meeting scheduling using a contracting approach [ Sen, 1994, Sen, 1996 ] and in cooperative coordination protocols <ref> [ Decker and Lesser, 1995 ] </ref> . Again, the agents did not require a monetary compensation for their efforts: an agent agreed to cancel a contract merely based on the fact that some other agent wanted to decommit.

Reference-contexts: For example, versions of the Vickrey auction have been used to allocate computation resources in operating systems <ref> [ Waldspurger et al., 1992, Drexler and Miller, 1988 ] </ref> , to allocate bandwidth in computer networks [ Sun Microsystems, 1996, MacKie-Mason and Varian, 1993, MacKie-Mason and Varian, 1994, Smart Market, 1996 ] , and to computationally control building environments [ Huberman and Clear-water, 1995 ] . <p> Miller and Drexler have discussed computational price-based market mechanisms as a basis for software publishing and distribution [ Miller and Drexler, 1988b ] as well as a mechanism for implementing processor scheduling and garbage collection in computer systems <ref> [ Drexler and Miller, 1988 ] </ref> . In addition to the price-based market mechanisms, resource-based mechanisms exist. For example, Kurose and Simha have developed a market mechanism|applied to file allocation|where at each iteration, the agents compute their marginal worths for resources [ Kurose and Simha, 1989 ] .

Reference-contexts: The initial paradigm was that of Funtionally Accurate/Cooperative (FA/C) agents [ Lesser and Corkill, 1981, Lesser, 1991 ] . Later the agents were equipped with the ability to form and negotiate over partial global plans (PGP) of performing interpretation actions <ref> [ Durfee and Lesser, 1989, Durfee and Lesser, 1991 ] </ref> . The latest work on this line of research has studied general coordination relationships and statistically analyzed how different coordination algorithms perform on the task [ Decker and Lesser, 1993b, Decker and Lesser, 1993a, Decker and Lesser, 1995 ] . <p> Theoretically, there is a chance that even this linear pass takes so long that all responses will be so late as to be in vain.

Reference-contexts: In such settings, the trend of increasing bandwidth actually enables negotiation applications that were infeasible before because more negotiation message traffic has become viable. 3 In cooperative distributed problem solving <ref> [ Durfee et al., 1989 ] </ref> , the system designer imposes an interaction protocol 1 and a strategy (a mapping from state history to actions; a way to use the protocol) for each agent.

Reference-contexts: The above education example works here if the agent knows the contracts|i.e. functions of education level|that will be offered before he chooses which education to acquire. 55 Ephrati and Rosenschein <ref> [ Ephrati and Rosenschein, 1993b, Ephrati, 1993 ] </ref> have discussed computational multiagent planning in a situation where the agent sincerely wants to follow the principals plan.

Reference-contexts: As to other forms of insincere behavior, an agent can lie about the cost that it is willing to pay to another agent for taking care of some of its tasks, or about the cost that it requires in order to accept some of the other agents' tasks. Ephrati <ref> [ Ephrati, 1994 ] </ref> presented an initial approach to solving the problem of exaggerating agents using the Clarke tax 12 voting mechanism in a meeting scheduling domain. <p> For example, an agent is unable to exactly compute the cost associated with accepting tasks from other agents, and the savings from having other agents take care of some of the agent's tasks. 1.1.3 Meeting Scheduling Another potential application for the techniques developed in this dissertation is distributed meeting scheduling <ref> [ Ephrati, 1994, Sen, 1994, Sen, 1996 ] </ref> . Such problems involve the assignment of times (and locations) to meetings. Constraints can involve for example capacity limitations on locations and on attendants (usually at most 13 one meeting per person at a time).

Reference-contexts: In Spawn, virtual money is continuously dribbled to the jobs, but there is no mechanism against forging currency or against insincere agents. 66 Ferguson et al. <ref> [ Ferguson et al., 1988 ] </ref> have studied a similar market mechanism for allocating jobs to processors based on repeated auctions, but their focus was not so much on fairness as on global efficiency.

Reference-contexts: In building computer support for negotiations among independent businesses or individuals, the issue of self-interest naturally arises. The importance of automated negotiation systems with self-interested agents is likely to increase as a result of three developments. One is the growth of a standardized communication infrastructure|EDI, NII, KQML <ref> [ Finin et al., 1992 ] </ref> , Telescript [ General Magic, Inc., 1994 ] , JAVA etc|over which separately designed agents belonging to different organizations can interact in an open environment in real-time, and safely carry out transactions [ Kristol et al., 1994, Low et al., 1994b, Kristol et al., 1994,

In this section we will discuss work that has addressed the dynamics. 38 Friend <ref> [ Friend, 1973, Kahan and Rapoport, 1984 ] </ref> has developed a program that simulates a 3-agent coalition formation situation where agents can make offers, acceptances, and rejections to each other regarding coalitions and payoffs. In the model, at most one offer regarding each agent can be active at a time.

Reference-contexts: This allows the agents to be constructed by separate designers and/or represent different real world parties. Interactions of self-motivated agents have been widely studied in microeconomics| especially in the subfield of game theory <ref> [ Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991, Kreps, 1990, Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> . Most of the results assume perfect rationality of the agents [ Schweers Cook and Levi, 1990, Howard, 1971 ] . <p> An example protocol is the auction, where some agents bid to take responsibility for a task, which is awarded to the lowest price bidder. The analog of a negotiation protocol is called a mechanism in game theory <ref> [ Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991, Kreps, 1990 ] </ref> . 4 models of bounded rationality have been mostly descriptive. They have been used positively for example in simulations and they have been used to critique some of the earlier results achieved in game theory under the perfect rationality assumption. <p> In other words, in Nash equilibrium, each agent chooses a strategy that is a best response to the other agents' strategies. There are two main problems in applying Nash equilibrium. First, in some games there exist no strategies that form an equilibrium <ref> [ Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991, Kreps, 1990, Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> . Second, some games have multiple Nash equilibria, and it is not obvious which one the agents should actually play [ Kreps, 1990 ] . <p> A refined solution concept called the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium is defined to be a Nash equilibrium that remains a Nash equilibrium in every subgame (even subgames that are not along the actual path of play and will thus never be reached) <ref> [ Selten, 1965, Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991, Kreps, 1990 ] </ref> . This solution concept also suffers from existence and uniqueness problems. Second, the Nash equilibrium only guarantees that no agent alone is better off by switching to another strategy. <p> Coalition-proof refinements of the Nash equilibrium, and other solution concepts for coalitions are presented in Section 2.1. Sometimes efficiency goals and stability goals conflict. A simple example of this is the two-person Prisoner's Dilemma game <ref> [ Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991, Kreps, 1990, Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> where the unique welfare maximizing and Pareto efficient strategy profile is the one where both agents cooperate, Table 1.2. <p> Else exit. The following theorems regarding these strategies use two concepts from game theory. Nash equilibrium <ref> [ Nash, 1950b, Kreps, 1990, Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991 ] </ref> means that each agent is motivated to adhere to its specified strategy given that the other agent adheres to its specified strategy. <p> The following theorems regarding these strategies use two concepts from game theory. Nash equilibrium [ Nash, 1950b, Kreps, 1990, Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991 ] means that each agent is motivated to adhere to its specified strategy given that the other agent adheres to its specified strategy. Subgame perfection <ref> [ Selten, 1965, Kreps, 1990, Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991 ] </ref> means that the equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium at any point (x n ; p n ) of the exchange, not only the beginning of it.

Reference-contexts: Three questions have to be answered to control single agent reasoning: which deliberation tasks to execute, in what order, and how much time to allocate to each one. This research can be divided according to two main criteria: interruptibility and number of reasoning tasks. In design-to-time algorithms <ref> [ D'Ambrosio, 1989, Garvey and Lesser, 1993 ] </ref> the meta-reasoner implicitly sets the run time and expected result quality by setting the reasoning algorithm parameters before execution. <p> Design-to-time algorithms are not guaranteed to have any answer available if interrupted before the planned time, and in the simplest case they have only one computational task. Garvey and Lesser <ref> [ Garvey and Lesser, 1993 ] </ref> study the combination of several computational tasks|some using the results of others|into a composite design-to-time algorithm. Anytime algorithms (also called flexible computations) are examples of interruptible processing. Their result quality usually increases with time, and some answer is available at any time.

Reference-contexts: Traditional AI systems work off-line. Their input is a complete problem description, and their output|acquired after some unknown, long time delay|is a complete answer. As problem solving systems scale up and longer execution times become common, many problem solving tasks become real-time <ref> [ Garvey and Lesser, 1994 ] </ref> , i.e. considerable changes in the real world take place during an agent's deliberation.

Reference-contexts: The importance of automated negotiation systems with self-interested agents is likely to increase as a result of three developments. One is the growth of a standardized communication infrastructure|EDI, NII, KQML [ Finin et al., 1992 ] , Telescript <ref> [ General Magic, Inc., 1994 ] </ref> , JAVA etc|over which separately designed agents belonging to different organizations can interact in an open environment in real-time, and safely carry out transactions [ Kristol et al., 1994, Low et al., 1994b, Kristol et al., 1994, Sandholm and Lesser, 1995b ] . <p> Specifically, the architecture determines the unit cost of computation, c comp . 1 In practice, CPU time can already be bought, e.g. on supercomputers. Similarly, the developing infrastructure for remotely executing agents provides an equivalent setting. For example in Telescript <ref> [ General Magic, Inc., 1994 ] </ref> , the remotely executing agents pay Teleclicks for CPU time to the owner of the host machine. <p> Thus, the laws cannot be enforced unless the terminated agent represented some real world party and the connection between the agent and the real world party can be traced. For example, the Telescript technology <ref> [ General Magic, Inc., 1994 ] </ref> follows the approach of strictly tying each agent to its real world party. On the contrary, we analyze exchanges among more 189 autonomous agents and study the possibility of exchange without enforcement (e.g. with unknown real world parties or no litigation possibility).

Reference-contexts: distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) [ Bond and Gasser, 1988, Huhns, 1987, Gasser and Huhns, 1989 ] has been split into two branches which have classically been called cooperative distributed problem solving (CDPS) [ Durfee et al., 1989, Decker et al., 1989, Lesser and Erman, 1980 ] and multiagent systems (MAS) <ref> [ Rosenschein and Genesereth, 1985, Genesereth et al., 1984 ] </ref> . The distinction has been fuzzy, but the main difference is that in CDPS, the agents are cooperative, e.g. because they are designed centrally, while in MAS, the agents are self-interested, e.g. because the agents are designed by separate parties.

Reference-contexts: (like a social choice rule but only figures out the highest ranked social outcome instead of a preference ordering) is the space of all combinations of individuals' preferences over 52 O, jOj 3, and the social choice function is implemented by a dominant strategy mechanism, then the function is dictatorial <ref> [ Gibbard, 1973, Satterthwaite, 1975, Kreps, 1990 ] </ref> . The design of social choice functions is not as impossible as it may seem in the light of the two impossibility theorems. This is because in many settings, the individual preferences are restricted|thus invalidating the conditions of the impossibility theorems.

Reference-contexts: So the rationality is restricted in terms of what histories an agent can remember, not in terms of how well it is able to solve combinatorial problems. Some of the results are counterintuitive, since in some cases, the less 77 rational agent is better off <ref> [ Gilboa and Samet, 1989 ] </ref> . Secondly, the model has been used to explain how cooperation occurs even in a finitely repeated prisoner's dilemma game, where rational agents would defect at each iteration [ Neyman, 1985, Papadimitriou and Yannakakis, 1994 ] .

Reference-contexts: In production externalities, one agent's production possibilities set is directly affected by another agent's actions.

Reference-contexts: Perfect rationality also assumes that agents can compute their marginal costs for tasks exactly and immediately, which is untrue in many practical situations. Lately, microeconomists have concentrated more on the issue of bounded rationality, where cognitive limitations of the interacting humans are brought into the discussion <ref> [ Simon, 1982, Good, 1971, Heiner, 1983, Heiner, 1985 ] </ref> . As economists study interactions among humans, their 1 By protocol we do not mean a low level communication protocol, but a negotiation protocol. <p> Within economics it has been realized that models that assume perfect rationality on behalf of the actors often do not accurately predict interaction outcomes among humans. Therefore, the concept of bounded rationality has been discussed, where cognitive limitations of the interacting humans are also considered <ref> [ Simon, 1982, Good, 1971 ] </ref> . Because the rationalities associated with humans are hard to quantify, these theories have mostly been qualitative. Secondly, they have been descriptive in that they exemplify how human rationality might be limited, but do not prescribe deliberation control methods that humans ought to adopt.

Reference-contexts: For example, an agent's preferences are often linear in payoff and an agent often does not care what payoffs other agents receive. For this type of settings, it is possible to design non-dictatorial social choice mechanisms. For example the Groves mechanisms <ref> [ Groves and Ledyard, 1977 ] </ref> levy a tax on the voters. The more the voter alters the outcome of the vote, the higher the tax. The taxation mechanism can be setup in a way that truthtelling about one's preferences is the dominant strategy.

In these application, the agents were totally cooperative, and selection of a contractee was based on suitability, for example adjacency, processing capability, and current agent load. However, there was no formal model discussed for making task announcing, bidding and awarding decisions.

Reference-contexts: This defines a tragedy of the commons (n-player prisoners' dilemma) <ref> [ Turner, 1992, Hardin, 1968 ] </ref> . The tragedy occurs mainly for low commitment messages (usually early in a negotiation): having multiple high commitment offers out simultaneously increases an agent's negotiation risk (Sec. 3.2) and computation costs (Sec. 3.6), so a self-interested agent will avoid this.

Horvitz <ref> [ Horvitz, 1987, Horvitz, 1988 ] </ref> addresses the choice of a single anytime algorithm and the number of steps to run it in a medical diagnosis domain. <p> They compute the change in intrinsic utility as the change in the utility that the agent gets by not executing the real world action perceived best before the computation, but executing the action perceived best after it (either action assumed to occur after the computation). Horvitz <ref> [ Horvitz, 1987 ] </ref> computes the comprehensive value of a computation as the product of a non-time-dependent object-related value and a time-dependent discount factor. <p> These two factors can be reasonably separated only if they are independent.

Reference-contexts: The core is used as a solution concept in Chapter 4 of this dissertation. Alternative solution concepts are discussed in the following sections. 2.1.2.2 Stable Sets Another solution concept for CFGs that attempts to remedy the nonexistence problem of the core is stable sets <ref> [ von Neumann and Morgenstein, 1947, Kahan and Rapoport, 1984 ] </ref> . This solution concept keeps individual and group rationality constraints but relaxes the requirement of coalition rationality. <p> It assumes individual rationality but relaxes coalition and group rationality. The bargaining set is based on threat analysis. An individually rational payoff configuration (~x; CS) is considered to be stable|i.e. in the bargaining set|if any threat to deviate from (~x; CS) can be answered by a counterthreat <ref> [ Kahan and Rapoport, 1984 ] </ref> . Say that agents k and l are members of the same coalition S j 2 CS. <p> Furthermore, the bargaining set is often not a unique point even within a given coalition structure. There have been multiple extensions to the bargaining set concept in order to restrict the space of outcomes within the solution concept <ref> [ Kahan and Rapoport, 1984 ] </ref> . The first extension considers only payoff configurations that are rational for all subgroups within each coalition of the coalition structure instead of all individually rational payoff configurations. The second extension allows objections and counter-objections by subgroups|either subgroups of current coalitions or any subgroups. <p> This corresponds to there being some bargaining cost in switching the coalition structure. The bargaining set is a subset of the *- bargaining set. Psychological extensions of the bargaining set include the modified bargaining set and the power bargaining set <ref> [ Kahan and Rapoport, 1984 ] </ref> . 33 2.1.2.4 Kernel Unlike the previous solution concepts which considered stability based on different types of threats, the kernel is based on a notion of fairly distributing excesses [ Kahan and Rapoport, 1984 ] . <p> extensions of the bargaining set include the modified bargaining set and the power bargaining set <ref> [ Kahan and Rapoport, 1984 ] </ref> . 33 2.1.2.4 Kernel Unlike the previous solution concepts which considered stability based on different types of threats, the kernel is based on a notion of fairly distributing excesses [ Kahan and Rapoport, 1984 ] . Let us define the excess of a coalition S 2 CS in a payoff configuration (~x; CS) as Definition 2.4 Excess e (S; ~x) = v R S i2S x i . The kernel is based on balancing excesses within each coalition. <p> The kernel is not a solution concept that models a bargaining process. It can rather be viewed as a criterion of fairness in an arbitration scheme. 34 2.1.2.5 Nucleolus Another solution concept for CFGs based on a notion of fairness is the nucleolus <ref> [ Kahan and Rapoport, 1984, Lundgren et al., 1992 ] </ref> . Instead of pairwise comparisons of excesses of the agents, it considers the excesses of each of the 2 jAj possible coalitions for a given coalition structure CS and payoff vector ~x. <p> Therefore, it inherits the desirable properties of symmetry and desirability from the kernel, and satisfies individual, coalition, and group rationality whenever the core is nonempty. 2.1.2.6 Equal Share Analysis Yet another solution concept for CFGs based on fairness considerations more than stability is equal share analysis <ref> [ Kahan and Rapoport, 1984 ] </ref> . A payoff configuration is within this solution concept if three conditions hold. First, no two coalitions in the coalition structure would be better off by joining. <p> If at some round all agents for a given coalition view that coalition as their best alternative, then that coalition forms on the round. In games examined to date, the scheme has always converged although a convergence proof has not been presented <ref> [ Kahan and Rapoport, 1984 ] </ref> . <p> Some of them also address the question of which coalition structure should form. But being static in nature, they do not address the dynamics of the coalition formation process. In this section we will discuss work that has addressed the dynamics. 38 Friend <ref> [ Friend, 1973, Kahan and Rapoport, 1984 ] </ref> has developed a program that simulates a 3-agent coalition formation situation where agents can make offers, acceptances, and rejections to each other regarding coalitions and payoffs. In the model, at most one offer regarding each agent can be active at a time. <p> The model is purely descriptive. There is no guarantee that a self-interested agent would be best off by using the specified local strategies. Transfer schemes are another dynamic approach to coalition formation <ref> [ Kahan and Rapoport, 1984 ] </ref> . The agents stay within a given coalition structure and exchange payments within each coalition according to demands computed in a prespecified manner. So, transfer schemes address the payoff distribution problem but not coalition structure generation. <p> We do not assume that one agent can take care of all the agents' tasks. Unlike our work, they also assume that all agents have the same capabilities (symmetric cost functions for task sets). Their method guarantees each agent an expected value that equals its Shapley value <ref> [ Kahan and Rapoport, 1984, Raiffa, 1982 ] </ref> . The Shapley value motivates individual agents to stay with the coalition structure (individual rationality) and the group of all agents to stay (group rationality).

In game theoretic terms, the principal has a coarser partition of information sets. <p> The basic idea in these games is that the agent tries to maximize its utility by using its finer information, and the principal is trying to maximize its payoff by using indirect methods to extract the agent's hidden information. In game theory (and rarely also in multiagent systems <ref> [ Kraus, 1993 ] </ref> ), contracting refers to the contracts that the principal uses in principal-agent problems to get at the agent's information.

Reference-contexts: This allows the agents to be constructed by separate designers and/or represent different real world parties. Interactions of self-motivated agents have been widely studied in microeconomics| especially in the subfield of game theory <ref> [ Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991, Kreps, 1990, Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> . Most of the results assume perfect rationality of the agents [ Schweers Cook and Levi, 1990, Howard, 1971 ] . <p> An example protocol is the auction, where some agents bid to take responsibility for a task, which is awarded to the lowest price bidder. The analog of a negotiation protocol is called a mechanism in game theory <ref> [ Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991, Kreps, 1990 ] </ref> . 4 models of bounded rationality have been mostly descriptive. They have been used positively for example in simulations and they have been used to critique some of the earlier results achieved in game theory under the perfect rationality assumption. <p> In other words, in Nash equilibrium, each agent chooses a strategy that is a best response to the other agents' strategies. There are two main problems in applying Nash equilibrium. First, in some games there exist no strategies that form an equilibrium <ref> [ Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991, Kreps, 1990, Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> . Second, some games have multiple Nash equilibria, and it is not obvious which one the agents should actually play [ Kreps, 1990 ] . <p> First, in some games there exist no strategies that form an equilibrium [ Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991, Kreps, 1990, Rasmusen, 1989 ] . Second, some games have multiple Nash equilibria, and it is not obvious which one the agents should actually play <ref> [ Kreps, 1990 ] </ref> . There are also limitations regarding what the Nash equilibrium guarantees even when it exists and is unique. First, in sequential games it only guarantees stability in the beginning of the game. <p> A refined solution concept called the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium is defined to be a Nash equilibrium that remains a Nash equilibrium in every subgame (even subgames that are not along the actual path of play and will thus never be reached) <ref> [ Selten, 1965, Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991, Kreps, 1990 ] </ref> . This solution concept also suffers from existence and uniqueness problems. Second, the Nash equilibrium only guarantees that no agent alone is better off by switching to another strategy. <p> Coalition-proof refinements of the Nash equilibrium, and other solution concepts for coalitions are presented in Section 2.1. Sometimes efficiency goals and stability goals conflict. A simple example of this is the two-person Prisoner's Dilemma game <ref> [ Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991, Kreps, 1990, Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> where the unique welfare maximizing and Pareto efficient strategy profile is the one where both agents cooperate, Table 1.2. <p> CFGs are a strict subset of NFGs. Because superadditivity, subadditivity, core, and the other solution concepts are undefined in non-CFGs, different solution concepts are necessary. One alternative is the Nash equilibrium <ref> [ Nash, 1950b, Kreps, 1990 ] </ref> , which was discussed in Section 1.2.4. It guarantees stability in the sense that no agent alone is motivated to deviate from the solution by changing its strategy given that others in the game do not deviate. <p> For Nash equilibrium implementation it states that any outcomes that can be achieved in Nash equilibrium using any mechanism that is representable as a finite game tree (with possibly moves by nature) can be achieved in Nash equilibrium using a direct revelation mechanism <ref> [ Kreps, 1990, Maskin, 1985, Postlewaite, 1985 ] </ref> . A direct revelation mechanism is a mechanism where the agents simultaneously and at once reveal their types, i.e. all of their private information. <p> Potential problems include the difficulty of modeling some free form negotiation situations as a game tree, the players' difficulty of computing the Nash equilibrium in a complex mechanism (leading to non-Nash play among computationally limited agents and human agents in practice), and the nonuniqueness of a Nash equilibrium <ref> [ Kreps, 1990 ] </ref> . The revelation principle for dominant strategy mechanisms states that the outcome of any dominant strategy mechanism can be achieved via a direct revelation mechanism where participation and truthtelling are dominant strategies [ Kreps, 1990, Muller and Satterwaithe, 1985 ] . <p> The revelation principle for dominant strategy mechanisms states that the outcome of any dominant strategy mechanism can be achieved via a direct revelation mechanism where participation and truthtelling are dominant strategies <ref> [ Kreps, 1990, Muller and Satterwaithe, 1985 ] </ref> . In the following subsections, mechanism design is discussed in specific settings. 2.2.1 Auction Theory Auction theory analyzes protocols and agents' strategies in auctions. An auction consists of an auctioneer and potential bidders. <p> Arrow's impossibility theorem states that there is no social choice rule that satisfies these four properties <ref> [ Arrow, 1963, Kreps, 1990, Ordeshook, 1986 ] </ref> . So to design social choice rules, the desiderata have to be relaxed. Commonly the first property is relaxed in the sense that the domain (combinations of individual preferences) on 51 which the rule works is restricted. <p> (like a social choice rule but only figures out the highest ranked social outcome instead of a preference ordering) is the space of all combinations of individuals' preferences over 52 O, jOj 3, and the social choice function is implemented by a dominant strategy mechanism, then the function is dictatorial <ref> [ Gibbard, 1973, Satterthwaite, 1975, Kreps, 1990 ] </ref> . The design of social choice functions is not as impossible as it may seem in the light of the two impossibility theorems. This is because in many settings, the individual preferences are restricted|thus invalidating the conditions of the impossibility theorems. <p> Also, the outcome chosen by the mechanism maximizes social welfare, and therefore also Pareto efficiency. Furthermore, participation in the mechanism can only increase an agent's utility, which makes the mechanism individually rational. The mechanism can be set up so that total tax revenue is positive <ref> [ Kreps, 1990 ] </ref> or negative [ Raiffa, 1982, Rasmusen, 1989 ] , but unfortunately it cannot equal zero. This means that the society's projects need to be funded from outside or that some of the collected tax revenue must be destroyed. <p> Ephrati also addressed distributing the mechanism, partial solutions for redistributing the tax waste, and partial solutions for the collusion problem. 2.2.3 Principal-Agent Problems In another field of mechanism design, principal-agent problems, there are two types of actors, principals and agents <ref> [ Rasmusen, 1989, Kreps, 1990 ] </ref> . There may be one or more of each [ Kraus, 1993 ] . The agents have more precise knowledge than the principals. In game theoretic terms, the principal has a coarser partition of information sets. <p> There is usually no analysis whether such a strategy is an agent's best response, or whether an agent could do better by deviating to using another strategy. The most extensively studied market framework is general equilibrium theory <ref> [ Var-ian, 1992, Kreps, 1990 ] </ref> . The market has two types of agents, producers and consumers. It has a finite number of commodities. The amount of each commodity is unrestricted, and each commodity is arbitrarily divisible. <p> General equilibria also exist in markets with no producers. In such pure exchange markets, the consumers just reallocate their initial endowments among themselves <ref> [ Varian, 1992, Kreps, 1990 ] </ref> . To reach a general equilibrium, the tatonnement process is usually used. This is an iterative mechanism, and the trades, production, and consumption are assumed to occur only after the process has terminated. At each iteration, the auctioneer sets a vector of prices. <p> also be explicitly conditioned on the acceptance of the future contracts, or it may specify low commitment for a short time during which the agent expects to make the remaining contracts of the sequence. 3.6 Contracting Implications of Limited Computation Interactions of self-interested agents have been widely studied in microeconomics <ref> [ Kreps, 1990, Varian, 1992, Raiffa, 1982 ] </ref> and DAI [ Rosenschein and Zlotkin, 1994, Ephrati and Rosenschein, 1991, Kraus et al., 1992, Durfee et al., 1993 ] , but perfect rationality of the agents has usually been assumed: flawless deduction, optimal reasoning about future contingencies and recursive modeling of other <p> Else exit. The following theorems regarding these strategies use two concepts from game theory. Nash equilibrium <ref> [ Nash, 1950b, Kreps, 1990, Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991 ] </ref> means that each agent is motivated to adhere to its specified strategy given that the other agent adheres to its specified strategy. <p> The following theorems regarding these strategies use two concepts from game theory. Nash equilibrium [ Nash, 1950b, Kreps, 1990, Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991 ] means that each agent is motivated to adhere to its specified strategy given that the other agent adheres to its specified strategy. Subgame perfection <ref> [ Selten, 1965, Kreps, 1990, Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991 ] </ref> means that the equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium at any point (x n ; p n ) of the exchange, not only the beginning of it.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the price-based market mechanisms, resource-based mechanisms exist.

Based on these worths, resources are reallocated at every iteration. This differs from equilibrium approaches where trades only occur after all iterations have been completed.

For example, when an international company initiates a mining venture in a developing country, it has to invest most of the capital up-front. This unsafe move motivates the developing country to renegotiate the conditions of the mining venture (profit division etc.).

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, moving both t 1 and t 2 to B would decrease the global cost to 3. So, this clustering contract is the only profitable contract in this game, Fig. 3.12. The need for larger transfers is well known in centralized iterative refinement optimization <ref> [ Lin and Kernighan, 1971, Waters, 1987 ] </ref> , but has been generally ignored in automated negotiation. In some non-automated allocation settings, the need for clusters has been realized. <p> One example is completing an iterative refinement algorithm by running an exhaustive complete algorithm after the refinement phase. Another example is switching from using one refinement operator (e.g. 2-swap in TSP <ref> [ Lin and Kernighan, 1971, Sandholm, 1993 ] </ref> ) to using another refinement operator (e.g. 3-swap in TSP). Furthermore, refinements often decrease solution cost in a step-wise, noncontinuous manner rendering the performance profiles locally nonconvex|as in our experiments (Fig. 4.1 left).

It can rather be viewed as a criterion of fairness in an arbitration scheme. 34 2.1.2.5 Nucleolus Another solution concept for CFGs based on a notion of fairness is the nucleolus <ref> [ Kahan and Rapoport, 1984, Lundgren et al., 1992 ] </ref> . Instead of pairwise comparisons of excesses of the agents, it considers the excesses of each of the 2 jAj possible coalitions for a given coalition structure CS and payoff vector ~x. <p> The problem instances in our example are so large that even the smallest ones are too hard to solve optimally. Therefore, rational coalition formation 177 algorithms for vehicle routing problems <ref> [ Lundgren et al., 1992 ] </ref> are unusable in this case. Our problem is outside the domain classification of Rosenschein and Zlotkin [ Rosen-schein and Zlotkin, 1994 ] , Fig. 4.2, because agents do not have symmetric capabilities due to heterogeneous fleets.

Reference-contexts: In some non-automated allocation settings, the need for clusters has been realized. For example, when the Federal Communications Commission auctions airwave bandwidth for restricted geographical areas, the bidders' valuations 136 for the auctioned items depend on what other items they are awarded <ref> [ McAfee and McMillan, 1996 ] </ref> . For example, some bidders want to receive a cluster of awards that allows them to establish nationwide coverage. In the FCC auctions, explicit clustering was not used, but the agents could construct the clusters from individually auctioned items.

Reference-contexts: In the Vickrey (second-price sealed-bid) auction, each bidder submits one bid without knowing the others' bids. The highest bidder wins, but at the price of the second highest bid <ref> [ Vickrey, 1961, Milgrom, 1985, Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> . An agent's strategy is his bid as a function of his private value and prior beliefs of others' valuations. The dominant strategy in private value Vickrey auctions is to bid one's true valuation. <p> One would imagine that the first-price auctions give higher expected revenue to the auctioneer because in second-price auctions the auctioneer only gets the second price. This is not the case however, because in first-price auctions the bidders are motivated to lie by biasing their bids downward. The revenue-equivalence theorem <ref> [ Vickrey, 1961, Milgrom, 1985, Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> states that all four auction protocols produce the same expected revenue to the auctioneer in private value auctions where the values are independently distributed. <p> If an agent bids its valuation and wins the auction, it will know that its valuation was too high because the other agents bid less. Therefore winning the auction amounts to a monetary loss. Knowing this in advance, agents should bid less than their valuations <ref> [ Milgrom, 1985, Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> . This is the best strategy in this type of Vickrey auctions also.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm allows the identification of local decision that are disadvantageous from the global perspective, and it incorporates goal relaxation. As an example, the method was applied to circuit restoration in a network. In the DENEGOT simulation <ref> [ Moehlman et al., 1992 ] </ref> , CDPS was used to coordinate fire fighting bulldozers and firebosses. The distributed search was structured in a small number of levels of satisfaction. Search proceeded into a worse level whenever a solution on the previous, better level could not be found. <p> A contractor had the option to award or not to award the tasks according to the bids. Counterproposing among cooperative agents has been studied for example in <ref> [ Moehlman et al., 1992, Sen, 1994, Sen, 1996 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: This is clearly infeasible, since even with the small example computer above, this would require more than 2 8000000 repetitions of the game. Recently, Mor and Rosenschein showed how time can be used to enable cooperation in a finitely repeated prisoner's dilemma among bounded rational agents <ref> [ Mor and Rosenschein, 1995 ] </ref> . Their idea is that an agent uses time whenever it checks from its memory the number of the iteration that is occurring. This delays its response, and the other agent can observe the delay.

Reference-contexts: Wellman discusses how the latter application fails to meet the assumptions for existence of a general equilibrium. For example, because some design parameters are discrete, production possibilities sets cannot be convex. Well-man and Mullen have also applied WALRAS to a distributed information network example <ref> [ Mullen and Wellman, 1995 ] </ref> . The iterative market process of WALRAS differs from tatonnement. Specifically, WALRAS uses asynchronous declarations 64 by the agents, and the agents bid demand functions (of price) as opposed to just quantities.

Reference-contexts: The Nash bargaining solution is a historically early solution concept that uses this approach <ref> [ Nash, 1950a ] </ref> . Nash analyzed a 2-agent setting where the agents have to decide on an outcome, and they get their fallbacks if no agreement is reached. <p> Now the 94 contractor's best response to this is to offer and no more. Thus, a Nash equilibrium exists for any that defines a contract that is IR for both agents. Actually, axiomatic bargaining theory <ref> [ Nash, 1950a, Osborne and Rubinstein, 1990 ] </ref> studies the question of choosing among these IR contracts by asserting desirable properties that the chosen contract should fulfill compared to the other contracts.

Reference-contexts: CFGs are a strict subset of NFGs. Because superadditivity, subadditivity, core, and the other solution concepts are undefined in non-CFGs, different solution concepts are necessary. One alternative is the Nash equilibrium <ref> [ Nash, 1950b, Kreps, 1990 ] </ref> , which was discussed in Section 1.2.4. It guarantees stability in the sense that no agent alone is motivated to deviate from the solution by changing its strategy given that others in the game do not deviate. <p> Else exit. The following theorems regarding these strategies use two concepts from game theory. Nash equilibrium <ref> [ Nash, 1950b, Kreps, 1990, Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991 ] </ref> means that each agent is motivated to adhere to its specified strategy given that the other agent adheres to its specified strategy.

Reference-contexts: Detailed information regarding tasks, resources and their dynamic state is usually not transmitted between agents; only abstractions (meta-information) such as load profiles of each resource class of each agent are sent <ref> [ Sycara et al., 1991, Neiman et al., 1994 ] </ref> . This bandwidth argument originates mostly from the Cooperative Distributed Problem Solving work of Lesser et al. (see e.g. [ Lesser and Erman, 1980 ] ), which was done in an interpretation domain.

Reference-contexts: Arrow's impossibility theorem states that there is no social choice rule that satisfies these four properties <ref> [ Arrow, 1963, Kreps, 1990, Ordeshook, 1986 ] </ref> . So to design social choice rules, the desiderata have to be relaxed. Commonly the first property is relaxed in the sense that the domain (combinations of individual preferences) on 51 which the rule works is restricted. <p> When the majority rule is used to pairwise compare alternative social outcomes so that the winner goes on to challenge further alternative outcomes and the loser is eliminated, the agenda, i.e. order of the pairings, can totally change the socially chosen outcome <ref> [ Ordeshook, 1986 ] </ref> . Specifically, in most games the outcome can be any one of the feasible social outcomes, even a Pareto dominated one, i.e. one that is preferred less than some other alternative by all agents. The introduction of irrelevant alternatives also often changes the outcome. <p> The Borda count can also lead to paradoxical results. For example removing the lowest ranked alternative from the set of possible social outcomes can lead to the second worst outcome turning best and the best outcome turning worst in a new Borda count <ref> [ Ordeshook, 1986 ] </ref> . So far it was assumed that in executing the social choice method, all agents' preferences are known. In reality this is seldom the case. Agents often need to reveal, i.e. declare, their preferences.

Reference-contexts: Real world settings usually consist of a finite number of competing agents, so neither monopoly nor perfect competition assumptions strictly apply. Osborne and Rubinstein have analyzed how close these classical assumptions come to the solutions from bargaining theory, which explicitly considers the interactions of agents <ref> [ Osborne and Rubinstein, 1990 ] </ref> . Within the multiagent systems research community, Kraus et al. have extended the work on sequential bargaining [ Kraus et al., 1992 ] . In addition to going over previous results, they contribute new theorems to the case with outside options. <p> Now the 94 contractor's best response to this is to offer and no more.

Principles for assessing decommitment penalties have been studied in the economics of law <ref> [ Calamari and Perillo, 1977, Posner, 1977 ] </ref> , but the purpose has been to assess a penalty on the agent that has breached the contract after the breach has occurred.

Reference-contexts: We do not assume that one agent can take care of all the agents' tasks. Unlike our work, they also assume that all agents have the same capabilities (symmetric cost functions for task sets). Their method guarantees each agent an expected value that equals its Shapley value <ref> [ Kahan and Rapoport, 1984, Raiffa, 1982 ] </ref> . The Shapley value motivates individual agents to stay with the coalition structure (individual rationality) and the group of all agents to stay (group rationality). <p> Therefore English and Vickrey auctions are not strategically equivalent in general, and may lead to different results. 46 Braspenning, 1994 ] . These methods are often susceptible to infinite escalations of bids <ref> [ Raiffa, 1982 ] </ref> , and will not be discussed further in this dissertation. 2.2.1.3 Revenue Equivalence and Non-Equivalence When considering one auction in isolation, each one of the four auction protocols (English, Dutch, first-price sealed-bid, and Vickrey) allocates the auctioned item Pareto efficiently to the bidder who values it the <p> Furthermore, participation in the mechanism can only increase an agent's utility, which makes the mechanism individually rational. The mechanism can be set up so that total tax revenue is positive [ Kreps, 1990 ] or negative <ref> [ Raiffa, 1982, Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> , but unfortunately it cannot equal zero. This means that the society's projects need to be funded from outside or that some of the collected tax revenue must be destroyed. It cannot be redistributed into the society of agents. <p> Some normative research in game theory has focused on utilizing the potential provided by probabilistically known future events by contingency contracts among self-interested agents <ref> [ Raiffa, 1982 ] </ref> . The obligations of the contract are made contingent on future events. There are games in which this method provides an expected payoff increase to both parties of the contract compared to any full commitment contract. <p> This increases social welfare. 93 * It allows beneficial contingency contracts by conditioning the payments and commitment functions on future negotiation events or domain events. These enlarge the set of mutually beneficial contracts, when agents have different expectations of future events or different risk attitudes <ref> [ Raiffa, 1982 ] </ref> . In the rest of this section, we substantiate the advantages of leveled commitment contracts more formally. We analyze contracting situations from the perspective of two agents: the contractor who pays to get a task done, and the contractee who gets paid for handling the task. <p> also be explicitly conditioned on the acceptance of the future contracts, or it may specify low commitment for a short time during which the agent expects to make the remaining contracts of the sequence. 3.6 Contracting Implications of Limited Computation Interactions of self-interested agents have been widely studied in microeconomics <ref> [ Kreps, 1990, Varian, 1992, Raiffa, 1982 ] </ref> and DAI [ Rosenschein and Zlotkin, 1994, Ephrati and Rosenschein, 1991, Kraus et al., 1992, Durfee et al., 1993 ] , but perfect rationality of the agents has usually been assumed: flawless deduction, optimal reasoning about future contingencies and recursive modeling of other <p> Therefore, if the supplier can commit to not renegotiating, the demander is motivated to follow the original contract and to not vanish. Renegotiation is more likely in unsafe exchange <ref> [ Lax and Sebenius, 1981, Raiffa, 1982 ] </ref> . For example, when an international company initiates a mining venture in a developing country, it has to invest most of the capital up-front. This unsafe move motivates the developing country to renegotiate the conditions of the mining venture (profit division etc.).

Reference-contexts: This allows the agents to be constructed by separate designers and/or represent different real world parties. Interactions of self-motivated agents have been widely studied in microeconomics| especially in the subfield of game theory <ref> [ Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991, Kreps, 1990, Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> . Most of the results assume perfect rationality of the agents [ Schweers Cook and Levi, 1990, Howard, 1971 ] . <p> In other words, in Nash equilibrium, each agent chooses a strategy that is a best response to the other agents' strategies. There are two main problems in applying Nash equilibrium. First, in some games there exist no strategies that form an equilibrium <ref> [ Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991, Kreps, 1990, Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> . Second, some games have multiple Nash equilibria, and it is not obvious which one the agents should actually play [ Kreps, 1990 ] . <p> Coalition-proof refinements of the Nash equilibrium, and other solution concepts for coalitions are presented in Section 2.1. Sometimes efficiency goals and stability goals conflict. A simple example of this is the two-person Prisoner's Dilemma game <ref> [ Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991, Kreps, 1990, Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> where the unique welfare maximizing and Pareto efficient strategy profile is the one where both agents cooperate, Table 1.2. <p> In general there is no dominant strategy for acting in this auction. With common knowledge assumptions regarding the probability distributions of the agents' values, it is possible to determine Nash equilibrium strategies for the agents <ref> [ Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> . In the Dutch (descending) auction, the seller continuously lowers the price until one of the bidders takes the item at the current price. <p> In the Vickrey (second-price sealed-bid) auction, each bidder submits one bid without knowing the others' bids. The highest bidder wins, but at the price of the second highest bid <ref> [ Vickrey, 1961, Milgrom, 1985, Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> . An agent's strategy is his bid as a function of his private value and prior beliefs of others' valuations. The dominant strategy in private value Vickrey auctions is to bid one's true valuation. <p> One would imagine that the first-price auctions give higher expected revenue to the auctioneer because in second-price auctions the auctioneer only gets the second price. This is not the case however, because in first-price auctions the bidders are motivated to lie by biasing their bids downward. The revenue-equivalence theorem <ref> [ Vickrey, 1961, Milgrom, 1985, Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> states that all four auction protocols produce the same expected revenue to the auctioneer in private value auctions where the values are independently distributed. <p> The English auction and the Vickrey auction actually self-enforce some of the most likely collusion agreements. Therefore, from the perspective of deterring collusion, the first-price sealed-bid and the Dutch auctions are preferable. The following example from <ref> [ Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> shows this. Let bidder Smith have value 20, and every other bidder have value 18 for the auctioned item. Say that the bidders collude by deciding that Smith will bid 6, and everyone else will bid 5. <p> If an agent bids its valuation and wins the auction, it will know that its valuation was too high because the other agents bid less. Therefore winning the auction amounts to a monetary loss. Knowing this in advance, agents should bid less than their valuations <ref> [ Milgrom, 1985, Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> . This is the best strategy in this type of Vickrey auctions also. <p> Furthermore, participation in the mechanism can only increase an agent's utility, which makes the mechanism individually rational. The mechanism can be set up so that total tax revenue is positive [ Kreps, 1990 ] or negative <ref> [ Raiffa, 1982, Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> , but unfortunately it cannot equal zero. This means that the society's projects need to be funded from outside or that some of the collected tax revenue must be destroyed. It cannot be redistributed into the society of agents. <p> Ephrati also addressed distributing the mechanism, partial solutions for redistributing the tax waste, and partial solutions for the collusion problem. 2.2.3 Principal-Agent Problems In another field of mechanism design, principal-agent problems, there are two types of actors, principals and agents <ref> [ Rasmusen, 1989, Kreps, 1990 ] </ref> . There may be one or more of each [ Kraus, 1993 ] . The agents have more precise knowledge than the principals. In game theoretic terms, the principal has a coarser partition of information sets. <p> On the other hand, in a discounted infinite round setting, the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium is unique. Specifically, the first offerer gets (1 ffi 2 )=(1 ffi 1 ffi 2 ), where the first offerer's discount factor is ffi 1 , and the other player's ffi 2 <ref> [ Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> . Agreement is reached up front. Another model of sequential bargaining does not use discounts, but assumes that there is a fixed bargaining cost per negotiation round. <p> As 205 another example, using constant interest rate (r) compounded interest, the discount function is f (t n ) = e rt n <ref> [ Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> . Real time is incorporated into the protocol by allowing the agents to postpone their moves. Again, the exchange conceptually proceeds in steps, but now the agent that makes a move during a step determines the time of the step.

Reference-contexts: distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) [ Bond and Gasser, 1988, Huhns, 1987, Gasser and Huhns, 1989 ] has been split into two branches which have classically been called cooperative distributed problem solving (CDPS) [ Durfee et al., 1989, Decker et al., 1989, Lesser and Erman, 1980 ] and multiagent systems (MAS) <ref> [ Rosenschein and Genesereth, 1985, Genesereth et al., 1984 ] </ref> . The distinction has been fuzzy, but the main difference is that in CDPS, the agents are cooperative, e.g. because they are designed centrally, while in MAS, the agents are self-interested, e.g. because the agents are designed by separate parties.

Reference-contexts: An agent may reveal only some of its tasks or resources or it might untruthfully reveal tasks or resources that do not exist. Rosenschein and Zlotkin have formally analyzed the issue of task revelation <ref> [ Rosenschein and Zlotkin, 1994 ] </ref> . Unfortunately their analysis of task oriented domains does not apply to most scheduling domains because it assumes that each agent has sufficient resources to potentially handle all of the tasks of all agents, and that the agents have symmetric costs for handling tasks. <p> Specifically, metrics were discussed that measure how much the intended plan and the actual plan deviate. 2.2.4 Two-Agent Task Revelation and Allocation Rosenschein and Zlotkin have applied game theoretic mechanism design concepts to computational multiagent systems <ref> [ Rosenschein and Zlotkin, 1994 ] </ref> . They address the problem of making insincere self-interested agents reveal private information such as their goals or worths for states. <p> Their most general class of games, Worth Oriented Domains (WODs), encompasses games where the agents have different numeric preferences|worths|for different states of the world, but all agents have the same capabilities and costs for moving the world from one state to another <ref> [ Rosenschein and Zlotkin, 1994, Zlotkin and Rosenschein, 1993c ] </ref> . <p> A subset of WODs, State Oriented Domains (SODs), includes games where the agents' worth functions over states are binary, i.e. agents have some goal states, and no states partially satisfy the agents <ref> [ Rosenschein and Zlotkin, 1994, Zlotkin and Rosenschein, 1993b ] </ref> . In WODs, the mechanisms attempt to make the agents declare their worths for different states, and in SODs they attempt to make the agents declare which states are goals. <p> In a subset of SODs, Task Oriented Domains (TODs), the agents have tasks to handle, and they try to redistribute the tasks so that they all get handled inexpensively <ref> [ Rosenschein and Zlotkin, 1994, Zlotkin and Rosenschein, 1993a ] </ref> . It is assumed that there is a symmetric monotonic cost function among the agents which assigns a real value to any subset of tasks. This is the cost that any single agent incurs in handling the tasks. <p> This corresponds to having both diseconomies and economies of scale in the domain. If only economies of scale were present, the task allocation problem would be trivial from the social welfare perspective: the optimal solution would be one where one agent handles all agents' tasks <ref> [ Rosenschein and Zlotkin, 1994, Zlotkin and Rosenschein, 1994 ] </ref> . On the other hand, in our setting that realistically also allows diseconomies of scale, the distribution of tasks among agents would not be trivial even if it were done centrally or among totally cooperative truthful agents. <p> Negative interactions can also be caused by conflicting goals. In satisfying their goals, nonmembers may actually move the world further from the coalition's goal state (s) <ref> [ Rosenschein and Zlotkin, 1994 ] </ref> . Positive interactions are often caused by partially overlapping goals. In satisfying their goals, nonmembers may actually move the world closer to the coalition's goal 4 The two are equivalent in constant-sum games with unrestricted side-payments and perfect communication.

Reference-contexts: The method has been used in adversary search and in single agent search. Sandholm and Lesser have presented an optimal method for terminating an anytime decision algorithm when the performance profile is conditioned on execution so far <ref> [ Sandholm and Lesser, 1994 ] </ref> . Progress monitoring with similar conditioning has later been studied in optimization problems, although in that work, optimality was sacrificed by making simplifying assumptions [ Hansen and Zilberstein, 1996 ] . <p> The problem of finding the exact form for the time-dependent part is crucial because algorithm choice and optimal time allocation are very sensitive to it [ Horvitz, 1987 ] . Sandholm and Lesser present a method for computing the time-dependent value of probabilistic information <ref> [ Sandholm and Lesser, 1994 ] </ref> . This method takes into account both the object-related and the time-related part simultaneously. Lesser et al. [ Lesser et al., 1988 ] identify three general ways to reduce solution quality for approximate processing. <p> In practice there is uncertainty in each performance profile: the meta-level is not exact. 3 Secondly, the performance profile depends on several features of the problem instance, and computing the mapping from the instance to the performance profile <ref> [ Sandholm and Lesser, 1994 ] </ref> may take considerable time, thus making the meta-level itself costly. In the limit, the base algorithm would be run at the meta-level to determine what it would achieve for a given time setting. <p> In general, for optimal meta-reasoning, the remaining part of a probabilistic performance profile should be conditioned on the algorithm's performance on that problem instance on previous CPU time steps <ref> [ Sandholm and Lesser, 1994, Zilberstein, 1993 ] </ref> . 168 and Zlotkin, 1994 ] analyze when rational agents are motivated to declare truthfully. Unfortunately that work assumes only two agents and that they can optimally solve exponentially many N P-complete problems without computation costs.

Reference-contexts: His protocol is based on mutual offers. In practice it is hard to prevent out-of-protocol offers such as multiagent offers. Finally, his 2-agent auction is manipulable and computationally inefficient. This is closely related to a contracting protocol of mine <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993 ] </ref> (TRA-CONET), where agents construct the global solution by contracting a small number of tasks at a time, and payments are made regarding each contract before new contracts take place. An agent updates its approximate solution after each task transfer. <p> For example in contracting settings, a bidder's evaluation of a task is affected by the prices at which the agent can subcontract the task or parts of it out to other agents. This type of recontracting is commonly allowed in automated versions of the contract net protocol also <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993, Smith, 1980 ] </ref> . 49 Common value (and correlated value) auctions suffer from the winner's curse. If an agent bids its valuation and wins the auction, it will know that its valuation was too high because the other agents bid less. <p> However, no formal model has been discussed for making task announcing, bidding and awarding decisions. On the other hand, the Transportation Cooperation Net (TRACONET) system, developed as an initial part of this thesis research, introduced such a formal model into automated contracting <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993, Sandholm, 1992a, Sandholm, 1991, Sandholm, 1992b ] </ref> . In that model, agents locally calculate their marginal costs for performing sets of tasks. The choice of contractors and contractees is based solely on these costs. <p> The initially low commitment to contracts can also be used as a mechanism to facilitate linking of deals. Often, there is no contract over a single item that is beneficial, but a combination of contracts among two agents would be <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993, Sandholm and Lesser, 1995c ] </ref> . <p> The next sections discuss some of these problems and present potential solutions. 3.7.1 Avoiding Message Congestion and Saturation Message congestion is a major problem in automated contracting <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993, Smith, 1980, Van Dyke Parunak, 1987 ] </ref> . While an agent takes a long time to process a large number of received messages, even more messages have time to arrive, and there is a high risk that the agent will finally be saturated. <p> This may happen because other agents have bid and been awarded the contract earlier, or no agent has been awarded the contract, but the deadline of the announcement has passed. Previous attempts to solve this problem include focused addressing [ Smith, 1980 ] and audience restrictions <ref> [ Van Dyke Parunak, 1987, Sandholm, 1993 ] </ref> . Focused addressing means that in highly constrained situations, agents with free resources announce availability, while in less constrained situations, agents with tasks announce tasks. <p> In practice, this never happened in our system. 3.7.2 Terminating Iterative Refinement Negotiations Knowing when to terminate distributed search is difficult [ Durfee and Lesser, 1989, Durfee and Lesser, 1991 ] |especially with distributed iterative refinement algorithms <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993 ] </ref> that are not based on a systematic and often slow backtracking scheme. TRACONET used the following termination heuristic for distributed iterative refinement: an agent stops negotiating once it has made no contracts during a certain fixed number of negotiation iterations. <p> One example is completing an iterative refinement algorithm by running an exhaustive complete algorithm after the refinement phase. Another example is switching from using one refinement operator (e.g. 2-swap in TSP <ref> [ Lin and Kernighan, 1971, Sandholm, 1993 ] </ref> ) to using another refinement operator (e.g. 3-swap in TSP). Furthermore, refinements often decrease solution cost in a step-wise, noncontinuous manner rendering the performance profiles locally nonconvex|as in our experiments (Fig. 4.1 left). <p> In this section we assume that the delivery order of the chunks is fixed. For example in the TRACONET (TRAnsportation COoperation NET) multiagent system <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993 ] </ref> , agents representing dispatch centers negotiated over whose vehicles should transport which parcels. Taking care of one parcel is an atomic chunk because the task cannot be split. <p> Taking care of one parcel is an atomic chunk because the task cannot be split. Sometimes a contract between two agents involved multiple tasks (in order to avoid local optima in distributed task allocation <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993 ] </ref> ) so the total exchange could have been split into smaller parts. For example, the demander could first pay part of the contract price. Then the supplier would deliver one parcel. After that the demander would pay some more, the supplier would deliver another parcel etc. <p> Similarly, a data retrieval agent may incur large costs in searching for certain information. Once the information is found, subsequent searches of related information are less expensive. The demander may also value a chunk differently depending on the other chunks delivered so far. In the TRACONET system <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993 ] </ref> , the chunks (transport tasks) were interdependent for both the supplier and the demander. Transporting a parcel often affects the marginal cost of transporting others.

Their setting is simpler than the one in this dissertation in that the value of a contract to an agent does not depend on which other ones of the agent's bids get accepted.

Reference-contexts: A refined solution concept called the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium is defined to be a Nash equilibrium that remains a Nash equilibrium in every subgame (even subgames that are not along the actual path of play and will thus never be reached) <ref> [ Selten, 1965, Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991, Kreps, 1990 ] </ref> . This solution concept also suffers from existence and uniqueness problems. Second, the Nash equilibrium only guarantees that no agent alone is better off by switching to another strategy. <p> The following theorems regarding these strategies use two concepts from game theory. Nash equilibrium [ Nash, 1950b, Kreps, 1990, Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991 ] means that each agent is motivated to adhere to its specified strategy given that the other agent adheres to its specified strategy. Subgame perfection <ref> [ Selten, 1965, Kreps, 1990, Fudenberg and Tirole, 1991 ] </ref> means that the equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium at any point (x n ; p n ) of the exchange, not only the beginning of it.

Reference-contexts: In general equilibrium market mechanisms (Section 2.4) such as WALRAS [ Well-man, 1992 ] , non-manipulative agents iterate over the allocation of resources and tasks, and payments are made only after a final solution is reached. Shechory and Kraus <ref> [ Shechory and Kraus, 1995a ] </ref> analyze coalition formation among rational agents with perfect information in domains that are not necessarily superadditive. Their protocol guarantees that if agents follow it, a certain stability criterion (K-stability) is met. This requires the solution of an exponential number of optimization problems.

Reference-contexts: Perfect rationality also assumes that agents can compute their marginal costs for tasks exactly and immediately, which is untrue in many practical situations. Lately, microeconomists have concentrated more on the issue of bounded rationality, where cognitive limitations of the interacting humans are brought into the discussion <ref> [ Simon, 1982, Good, 1971, Heiner, 1983, Heiner, 1985 ] </ref> . As economists study interactions among humans, their 1 By protocol we do not mean a low level communication protocol, but a negotiation protocol. <p> Within economics it has been realized that models that assume perfect rationality on behalf of the actors often do not accurately predict interaction outcomes among humans. Therefore, the concept of bounded rationality has been discussed, where cognitive limitations of the interacting humans are also considered <ref> [ Simon, 1982, Good, 1971 ] </ref> . Because the rationalities associated with humans are hard to quantify, these theories have mostly been qualitative. Secondly, they have been descriptive in that they exemplify how human rationality might be limited, but do not prescribe deliberation control methods that humans ought to adopt.

Reference-contexts: For example in contracting settings, a bidder's evaluation of a task is affected by the prices at which the agent can subcontract the task or parts of it out to other agents. This type of recontracting is commonly allowed in automated versions of the contract net protocol also <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993, Smith, 1980 ] </ref> . 49 Common value (and correlated value) auctions suffer from the winner's curse. If an agent bids its valuation and wins the auction, it will know that its valuation was too high because the other agents bid less. <p> On the other hand, many multiagent systems consisting of cooperative agents incorporate some form of decommitment possibility in order to allow the agents to accommodate new events. For example, in the original Contract Net Protocol <ref> [ Smith, 1980 ] </ref> , the agent that had contracted out a task could send a termination message to cancel the contract even when the contractee had already partially fulfilled the contract. <p> For example, the focused addressing scheme of the CNP was implemented so that in low utilization situations, contractors announced tasks, but in high utilization mode, potential contractees signaled availability|i.e. bid without receiving announcements first <ref> [ Smith, 1980, Van Dyke Parunak, 1987 ] </ref> . So, the choice of a protocol was based on characteristics of the environment. Alternatively, the choice can be made for each negotiation separately before that negotiation begins. <p> The next sections discuss some of these problems and present potential solutions. 3.7.1 Avoiding Message Congestion and Saturation Message congestion is a major problem in automated contracting <ref> [ Sandholm, 1993, Smith, 1980, Van Dyke Parunak, 1987 ] </ref> . While an agent takes a long time to process a large number of received messages, even more messages have time to arrive, and there is a high risk that the agent will finally be saturated. <p> This may happen because other agents have bid and been awarded the contract earlier, or no agent has been awarded the contract, but the deadline of the announcement has passed. Previous attempts to solve this problem include focused addressing <ref> [ Smith, 1980 ] </ref> and audience restrictions [ Van Dyke Parunak, 1987, Sandholm, 1993 ] . Focused addressing means that in highly constrained situations, agents with free resources announce availability, while in less constrained situations, agents with tasks announce tasks.

Reference-contexts: Detailed information regarding tasks, resources and their dynamic state is usually not transmitted between agents; only abstractions (meta-information) such as load profiles of each resource class of each agent are sent <ref> [ Sycara et al., 1991, Neiman et al., 1994 ] </ref> . This bandwidth argument originates mostly from the Cooperative Distributed Problem Solving work of Lesser et al. (see e.g. [ Lesser and Erman, 1980 ] ), which was done in an interpretation domain. <p> Also, the real world natural distribution of a scheduling problem seldom equals the distribution that would be computationally most efficient. Furthermore, parallel asynchronous search among agents often (yet not always [ Conry et al., 1991 ] ) involves giving up desirable algorithm properties such as completeness <ref> [ Sycara et al., 1991 ] </ref> . Another issue supporting distribution in cooperative settings is reactivity: agents can locally react to local changes faster than a centralized system could.

Reference-contexts: The bandwidth limitation also warrants distributed processing in some special domains such as autonomous submersibles that have to communicate over a very low bandwidth acoustic link <ref> [ Turner and Eaton, 1994 ] </ref> . In the setting of this dissertation, the very reason for distributed reasoning in planning and scheduling domains is the self-motivation of the agents|instead of the bandwidth limitation.

Reference-contexts: This defines a tragedy of the commons (n-player prisoners' dilemma) <ref> [ Turner, 1992, Hardin, 1968 ] </ref> . The tragedy occurs mainly for low commitment messages (usually early in a negotiation): having multiple high commitment offers out simultaneously increases an agent's negotiation risk (Sec. 3.2) and computation costs (Sec. 3.6), so a self-interested agent will avoid this.

Reference-contexts: General equilibria also exist in markets with no producers. In such pure exchange markets, the consumers just reallocate their initial endowments among themselves <ref> [ Varian, 1992, Kreps, 1990 ] </ref> . To reach a general equilibrium, the tatonnement process is usually used. This is an iterative mechanism, and the trades, production, and consumption are assumed to occur only after the process has terminated. At each iteration, the auctioneer sets a vector of prices. <p> Some mechanisms to attack externality problems include taxes and viewing some of the externality issues as commodities themselves <ref> [ Varian, 1992 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: In the Vickrey (second-price sealed-bid) auction, each bidder submits one bid without knowing the others' bids. The highest bidder wins, but at the price of the second highest bid <ref> [ Vickrey, 1961, Milgrom, 1985, Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> . An agent's strategy is his bid as a function of his private value and prior beliefs of others' valuations. The dominant strategy in private value Vickrey auctions is to bid one's true valuation. <p> On the other hand, Vickrey auctions have not been widely adopted in auctions among humans [ Rothkopf and Harstad, 1995, Rothkopf et al., 1990 ] even though the protocol was laid out 25 years ago <ref> [ Vickrey, 1961 ] </ref> . Limitations of the Vickrey auction protocol|especially in computational multiagent systems|have been discussed by Sandholm in [ Sandholm, 1996 ] . All-pay auctions are another family of auction protocols. In such mechanisms, all participating bidders have to pay something to the auctioneer. <p> One would imagine that the first-price auctions give higher expected revenue to the auctioneer because in second-price auctions the auctioneer only gets the second price. This is not the case however, because in first-price auctions the bidders are motivated to lie by biasing their bids downward. The revenue-equivalence theorem <ref> [ Vickrey, 1961, Milgrom, 1985, Rasmusen, 1989 ] </ref> states that all four auction protocols produce the same expected revenue to the auctioneer in private value auctions where the values are independently distributed.

Reference-contexts: For example, versions of the Vickrey auction have been used to allocate computation resources in operating systems <ref> [ Waldspurger et al., 1992, Drexler and Miller, 1988 ] </ref> , to allocate bandwidth in computer networks [ Sun Microsystems, 1996, MacKie-Mason and Varian, 1993, MacKie-Mason and Varian, 1994, Smart Market, 1996 ] , and to computationally control building environments [ Huberman and Clear-water, 1995 ] . <p> Money is repeatedly dribbled to the agents so that they can continue bidding. The system works in practice although its formal properties have not been proven. The Spawn system for allocating independent computation jobs among heterogeneous processors in a network works on the same basis <ref> [ Waldspurger et al., 1992 ] </ref> . Every time a processor becomes idle, it runs a second-price sealed-bid auction in which computation jobs can bid for the right to execute for a duration specified in the bid. The agents use prespecified strategies: the approach is not normative.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, moving both t 1 and t 2 to B would decrease the global cost to 3. So, this clustering contract is the only profitable contract in this game, Fig. 3.12. The need for larger transfers is well known in centralized iterative refinement optimization <ref> [ Lin and Kernighan, 1971, Waters, 1987 ] </ref> , but has been generally ignored in automated negotiation. In some non-automated allocation settings, the need for clusters has been realized.

Reference-contexts: Under certain technical conditions, this process is guaranteed to converge to a general equilibrium. Within computational multiagent systems, Wellman has developed a general equilibrium based software system called WALRAS. As example domains, he has used WALRAS in flow routing in a network <ref> [ Wellman, 1992 ] </ref> , and in configuration design [ Wellman, 1994 ] . Wellman discusses how the latter application fails to meet the assumptions for existence of a general equilibrium. For example, because some design parameters are discrete, production possibilities sets cannot be convex.

Reference-contexts: In general, for optimal meta-reasoning, the remaining part of a probabilistic performance profile should be conditioned on the algorithm's performance on that problem instance on previous CPU time steps <ref> [ Sandholm and Lesser, 1994, Zilberstein, 1993 ] </ref> . 168 and Zlotkin, 1994 ] analyze when rational agents are motivated to declare truthfully. Unfortunately that work assumes only two agents and that they can optimally solve exponentially many N P-complete problems without computation costs. <p> Extensions to coalition formation include generalizing the methods to agents with different performance profiles, probabilistic performance profiles, and anytime algorithms where the performance profiles are conditioned on execution so far <ref> [ Sand-holm and Lesser, 1994, Zilberstein, 1993 ] </ref> . Agents with probabilistic performance profiles may want to reselect a coalition if the value of their original coalition is lower than expected|but sunk computation cost has already been incurred.

Reference-contexts: In a subset of SODs, Task Oriented Domains (TODs), the agents have tasks to handle, and they try to redistribute the tasks so that they all get handled inexpensively <ref> [ Rosenschein and Zlotkin, 1994, Zlotkin and Rosenschein, 1993a ] </ref> . It is assumed that there is a symmetric monotonic cost function among the agents which assigns a real value to any subset of tasks. This is the cost that any single agent incurs in handling the tasks.

Reference-contexts: A subset of WODs, State Oriented Domains (SODs), includes games where the agents' worth functions over states are binary, i.e. agents have some goal states, and no states partially satisfy the agents <ref> [ Rosenschein and Zlotkin, 1994, Zlotkin and Rosenschein, 1993b ] </ref> . In WODs, the mechanisms attempt to make the agents declare their worths for different states, and in SODs they attempt to make the agents declare which states are goals.

Reference-contexts: Their most general class of games, Worth Oriented Domains (WODs), encompasses games where the agents have different numeric preferences|worths|for different states of the world, but all agents have the same capabilities and costs for moving the world from one state to another <ref> [ Rosenschein and Zlotkin, 1994, Zlotkin and Rosenschein, 1993c ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: The method can be implemented in a largest-excess-first fashion, or in a round-robin fashion among agents. Both schemes converge to the core if it is nonempty. All of the transfer schemes assume that the agents know the values of the characteristic function. Zlotkin and Rosenschein <ref> [ Zlotkin and Rosenschein, 1994 ] </ref> analyze coalition formation among rational agents that cannot make side payments, while our agents do. Their analysis is limited to "Subadditive Task Oriented Domains" (STODs), which are a strict subset of CFGs, Fig. 4.2. In their solution concept, one agent handles all the tasks. <p> This corresponds to having both diseconomies and economies of scale in the domain. If only economies of scale were present, the task allocation problem would be trivial from the social welfare perspective: the optimal solution would be one where one agent handles all agents' tasks <ref> [ Rosenschein and Zlotkin, 1994, Zlotkin and Rosenschein, 1994 ] </ref> . On the other hand, in our setting that realistically also allows diseconomies of scale, the distribution of tasks among agents would not be trivial even if it were done centrally or among totally cooperative truthful agents.
