Title: ARCHITECTURE FOR A NON-DETERMINISTIC SIMULATION MACHINE  
Author: Marc Bumble Lee Coraor 
Address: Park, PA 16801, U.S.A.  
Affiliation: Computer Science and Engineering The Pennsylvania State University University  
Abstract: Causality constraints of random discrete simulation make parallel and distributed processing difficult. Methods of applying reconfigurable logic to implement and accelerate simulation service event queues are presented which process simulation events at a rate of one event per 80 nanoseconds. The event generator presented in our previous work (Bumble and Coraor 1998) is also capable of sustaining the 80ns clock rate, providing overall speedup rates which depend on the software comparison scenario. The software comparison cited in this work provides a 2 order of magnitude speedup. The speedup factor varies with the size of the software event queue. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are used to implement and test the service queue design.

Reference-contexts: At these endpoints, instructions are fetched and decoded to perform work on the given operands or data. Systolic Communications <ref> (Kung 1988) </ref>, on the other hand, allows the required processing to occur as data flows from one location to the next. Although proposed some time ago, systolic communications is difficult to implement, but with the advent of reconfigurable logic, this approach is very attractive for discrete event simulation.

Reference-contexts: The process requires a fair amount of data independence and happens to work well with non-deterministic simulation models. 2 RELATED WORK Historically, deterministic logic simulation has been the chief application for simulation accelerators.
