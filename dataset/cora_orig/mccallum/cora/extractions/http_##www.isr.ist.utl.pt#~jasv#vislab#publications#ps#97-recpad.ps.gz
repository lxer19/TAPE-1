Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of tracking a moving target by a monocular observer. Tracking a moving target is one of the basic functionalities of any active vision system and may be used to retrieve important information about the target/observer 3D motion, shape, etc. The strategy we present is based on the integration of correlation based techniques together with active contours, using a Kalman filtering approach. The active eye system consists on a camera mounted on a pan & tilt unit. We describe in detail the motion algorithms used and the control system design issues. Due to some simplifications of the motion algorithms, the overall operating frequency is about 6Hz. The system is robust both to changes in the illumination and multiple moving objects in cluttered environments. Results are presented and discussed.

Reference-contexts: Curwen and Blake [7] impose shape assumptions on the deformable contour; the drawback being that large target deformations are not allowed. They use a parametric representation of the curve to save time (B-Splines). Recent work is based in the automatic control of spatio-temporal scale <ref> [3] </ref>. The approach we follow is based on deformable models as a tracking methodology, since they can cope with the active change of the object shape.

Reference-contexts: However, this approach may lead to system instabilities, and at the current stage we chose to use a simpler PID controller. A review of control of systems with delay in the context of vision can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. 6. Experimental Results The experimental setup used in this work consist in a Directed Perception PTU-46-17.5 pantilt unit (see Fig.3) and a EDC-1000L digital camera with a 12.5mm lens. The pantilt unit is controlled from the hosts via a serial link.

Reference-contexts: If the camera were moving during this period, there would be motion induced over all the image plane and the segmentation would become much more difficult. In such cases, one could use image stabilisation methods [12] or multiple motion estimation at various resolutions, as described in <ref> [10] </ref> where a coarse-to-fine strategy is employed on a relaxation process, over an image pyramid. An example of the initial motion detection step is shown in Figure 2. initialization 3.2.

Reference-contexts: The use of a closed loop control system, imposes strong constraints in the computational cost of the motion algorithms to be used. We integrate both correlation measurements and deformable contours <ref> [11] </ref> to enhance the tracking robustness. The performance of the tracking system is improved by the use of a Kalman-Bucy filter to predict the target position and velocity in the image plane together with uncertainty estimates. This information is used to speed up the algorithms in two ways. <p> The external forces on the contour result from a potential P z e ( ) .

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we assume that the camera is initially stationary. If the camera were moving during this period, there would be motion induced over all the image plane and the segmentation would become much more difficult. In such cases, one could use image stabilisation methods <ref> [12] </ref> or multiple motion estimation at various resolutions, as described in [10] where a coarse-to-fine strategy is employed on a relaxation process, over an image pyramid.

Reference-contexts: Since the observer is in motion, a velocity field is induced all over the image. This problem is far from being solved and the existing algorithms (typically segmenting various motion models) are very time consuming. The approach followed by Murray et al. in <ref> [13] </ref> consists in first extracting corner points of the target image, which are then tracked using correlation. They assume that the observer motion is known and that the target moves at constant velocity relative to the camera. Correlation techniques have been widely used also in stereo [8,18].

Reference-contexts: Related Work Many methods have been presented to track a moving object over a sequence of images. The techniques must often used are optical-flow, correlation techniques and deformable contours. The use of optical flow involves the segmentation of the object to be tracked from the scene background <ref> [17] </ref>. Since the observer is in motion, a velocity field is induced all over the image. This problem is far from being solved and the existing algorithms (typically segmenting various motion models) are very time consuming.
