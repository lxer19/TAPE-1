Title: Abstract  
Note: 1.0 Introduction  
Abstract: The electronic architecture and dynamic signal processing capabilities of an artificial dendritic tree which can be used to process and classify dynamic signals is described. The electrical circuit architecture is modeled after neurons that have spatially extensive dendritic trees. The artificial dendritic tree is a hybrid VLSI circuit and is sensitive to both temporal and spatial signal characteristics. It does not use the conventional neural network concept of weights, and as such it does not use multipliers, adders, lookup-tables, microprocessors or other complex computational units to process signals. The weights of conventional neural networks, which take the form of numerical, resistive, voltage, or current values, but do not have any spatial or temporal content, are replaced with connections whose spatial location have both a temporal and scaling significance. Interest in using artificial neural networks for the identification and control of dynamical systems is growing (e.g. Narendra and Parthasarathy, 1989). However, most neural network models do not include spatiotemporal dynamic signal processing capabilities. In these models, the neuron is treated as a point entity that receives and processes inputs at the soma, which makes spatial signal processing difficult or impossible. In our modeling approach, we have looked beyond the soma to the extensive dendritic tree structure of neurons, which not only forms most of the cells surface area but provides spatiotemporal signal processing capabilities not present in models which assume a point-entity neuron.
