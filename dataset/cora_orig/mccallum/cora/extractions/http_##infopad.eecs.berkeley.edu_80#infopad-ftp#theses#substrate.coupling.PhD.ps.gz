Reference-contexts: Latch-up in CMOS circuits is a classic case of positive feedback through the substrate and has been extensively studied in the past <ref> [1] </ref>. Guard rings and backplane contacts can be used to reduce the loop-gain through the substrate. Low-resistivity substrates are in fact popular choices for CMOS fabrication because of their latch-up suppressing properties.

Reference-contexts: The substrate is lossy and is modeled by resistors R sbp and R s1 , which represent the bond-pad to substrate-ground and the collector-to-substrate-ground model-elements respectively. The thermal noise in a resistor R can be modeled as an Additive White Gaussian noise (AWGN) of power-spectral-density 4kTR <ref> [2] </ref>. The noise sources modeling the thermal noise of R sbp and R s1 are shown in Fig. 29a as V 2 n2 and V 2 n1 respectively. C sbp is the bond-pad capacitance and C s1 is the collector-to-substrate capacitance of the BJT. <p> The noise source V 2 n2 is amplified by the transistor and adds to the noise power-spectral-density (PSD) at the output and will therefore be more harmful to circuit performance than V 2 n1 . The expression for the output PSD without the substrate noise sources is derived in <ref> [2] </ref>. The power-spectral density of the noise contribution at the output due to V 2 n2 is given by the following expression 103 where , , , and . <p> In MOS transistors a DC change in the threshold voltage V t can also result. A change in the threshold voltage will lead to a change in the gain of the device and also the bias quantities in the circuit. As discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>, a change of DV bias in the substrate potential changes the drain-current I d of a MOSFET by the following relation 13. An abrupt junction is assumed.

Reference-contexts: Avalanche injection in NMOSFETs and the current levels in the parasitic pnp devices in npn BJTs can be reduced by biasing the devices such that the substrate injection is minimized <ref> [3] </ref>. This may not always be possible since the device bias-levels are decided by more important circuit issues. Therefore the most practical way to reduce the DC I 2 R loss is to provide a low-resistance path to ground. DC current injection into the substrate can lead 10.

Reference-contexts: Due to this limitation it has not been a popular modeling procedure, except in certain cases where the behavior of the potential function may be essentially considered two-dimensional even though the problem is three-dimensional, for example for calculating fringing fields in a parallel plate capacitor <ref> [6] </ref>. This technique involves determining an analytic function F of the complex variable z, which maps the complex Z plane (or the XY plane) onto another plane W such that W=F (z).

Reference-contexts: The differential form of the Gausss law relates the potential function f to the free charge density r through the following partial differential equation (30) The dielectric constant e is a measure of the polarizability of the medium <ref> [7] </ref> and can be considered to be an isotropic quantity in most modeling problems. <p> The uniqueness theorem of electrostatics <ref> [7] </ref> assures the existence of a unique solution to the Poisson equation in the presence of these three types of boundary conditions. <p> function y (r, r'), in the presence of finite boundaries can be thought off as consisting of two parts, the first is the free-space Green function and the second is the potential due to charges outside the volume V, distributed so that the required boundary conditions are satisfied on S <ref> [7] </ref>. The Method of Images The method of images is a simple technique to determine the Green function. In this method, point charges are distributed in space in order to achieve the required boundary conditions. <p> The SOV technique in different coordinate systems is discussed in <ref> [7] </ref>. The potential in the cylindrical coordinate system can be expanded in terms of Bessel functions. In spherical coordinates, the potential can be expressed in terms of Legendre polynomials. These solutions are not discussed here. Substrate geometries in semiconductors conform to the rectangular system. <p> The first technique involves integrating over the point source discontinuity, and matching potential and field boundary conditions in the plane of the point charge. The second technique involves expressing the potential as an eigenfunction summation <ref> [7] </ref>. The second method can be considerably slower to converge than the former and is not discussed. <p> or for Dirichlet boundaries the second term can be set to zero and the integral equation reduced to (47) 3 V n f G S += 3 V d g C 12 C 2g f constant 1 2 (a) (c) 35 This simplification is not possible in Neumann boundary problems <ref> [7] </ref>. The potential at any point of the contact can be taken as representative of the contact potential, or the average potential over the volume of the contact can be treated as the contact potential.

Reference-contexts: In this section, four iterative techniques are presented. These techniques typify the solution strategies employed in a wide cross-section of iterative schemes.

Reference-contexts: In such cases, the N x 1 21 iterative techniques presented below are found to be more suitable. 3.1.3: Simple Iterative Techniques Iterative techniques used in the solution of sparse matrices have been discussed extensively in the past <ref> [9] </ref>. Iterative techniques have the advantage that they work with the system matrix, without modifying the matrix significantly. If the matrix is sparse to begin with, the sparsity is preserved throughout the solution procedure. Iterative techniques generally start with an initial approximation to the solution vector. <p> In this section, four iterative techniques are presented. These techniques typify the solution strategies employed in a wide cross-section of iterative schemes. The convergence analysis for these and other schemes have been presented in [8], <ref> [9] </ref> and [10]. Jacobis Method and The Gauss-Siedel Relaxation Scheme The simplest iterative technique for solution of [A][X]=[b] is the Jacobis method. In this method a sequence of vectors approximating the solution vector are obtained as follows. <p> The asymptotic rate-of-convergence can be determined for several iterative schemes.

Jacobis Method and The Gauss-Siedel Relaxation Scheme The simplest iterative technique for solution of [A][X]=[b] is the Jacobis method. In this method a sequence of vectors approximating the solution vector are obtained as follows. <p> The Conjugate Gradient Algorithm The advantage of iterative algorithms over direct techniques such as Gaussian elimination lies in the fact that these techniques exploit sparsity well. A direct method with a similar property is the Conjugate Gradient algorithm <ref> [10] </ref>. This technique tries to find the solution of [A][x]=[b] by minimizing the function (1/2)[x T ][A][x]-[b][x]. In this technique, as in the iterative techniques discussed above, an approximate vector [x k ] is iterated until it converges to [x].

Reference-contexts: Several additional techniques exist for efficient solution of sparse matrices. Many of these rely on determining a suitable iteration matrix for the problem. One such technique uses a combination of an iterative method and the Conjugate Gradient Algorithm discussed above <ref> [11] </ref>. The method is faster than SOR but requires more storage. This technique was used for solving the substrate problem recently [12]. The iterative schemes discussed above are the only practical techniques for solving the large matrices which result from the finite differences technique.

Reference-contexts: One such technique uses a combination of an iterative method and the Conjugate Gradient Algorithm discussed above [11]. The method is faster than SOR but requires more storage. This technique was used for solving the substrate problem recently <ref> [12] </ref>. The iterative schemes discussed above are the only practical techniques for solving the large matrices which result from the finite differences technique. However, despite all of the simplifying assumptions made earlier in Section 3.0, the solution of substrate problems with more than ten-to-twenty contacts becomes impractical as discussed later. <p> Due to this reason the finite-differences technique was not used for substrate parasitic extraction. 3.1.4: Modeling the Frequency-Dependence of Substrates The problem of the determining the frequency response of the substrate has been analyzed in <ref> [12] </ref>. Before discussing the technique presented there, the frequency response of two different types of substrates is analyzed. These are the uniform (single-resistivity), and the low-impedance substrates shown in Fig. 1b. <p> The substrate model behavior with respect to frequency is quite complex for more complicated substrate cross-sections, as the different layers of silicon have different time constants. A technique known as Asymptotic Waveform Evaluation (AWE) has recently been applied to the problem in <ref> [12] </ref>. AWE constructs an approximate representation of the frequency response of a circuit by selecting an appropriate low-order transfer function to model the circuit. AWE determines the frequency response of a circuit by a two-step process. <p> While this technique is elegant in its approach, the utility of its use in substrate modeling problems, as discussed in <ref> [12] </ref>, is questionable. The principal reason is that with typical substrate doping levels, the substrate impedance in silicon is dominated by the conductance and not the susceptance up to 4-5GHz. For substrates with higher doping levels (or higher conductivity), this frequency is higher. <p> For substrates with higher doping levels (or higher conductivity), this frequency is higher. However the appearance of the skin-effect modes in high-conductivity substrates at these frequencies complicates the modeling problem. This issue is not addressed in <ref> [12] </ref>. Thus for most substrate modeling tasks, the additional computational complexity of AWE over a simple electrostatic model may not be justifiable.

Reference-contexts: The first involves extracting the moments of the circuit and the second involves matching these moments to a low-order transfer function. The second process is done by use of the Pade approximation. A discussion of this technique is presented in <ref> [13] </ref>. Once a low order transfer function has been found for the circuit, the time response with an arbitrary time input such as a step or an exponential, may be found by multiplying the s-domain representation of the input with the transfer function and performing an inverse Laplace transform.

Reference-contexts: The potential of a point charge in a medium is known as the Green function of the medium. In this section, the concept of the Green functions as applicable to electrostatic problems is discussed. Green functions are useful as solution techniques in many problems such as full-electromagnetic calculations <ref> [15] </ref> or diffusion problems. Consider two arbitrary scalar fields f and y defined in a volume V bounded by a surface S. The divergence of the vector fields and is given by (33) (34) respectively.

Reference-contexts: However, very few mixed-boundary value problems are amenable to direct solution techniques, and a purely theoretical solution often requires making approximations of treating certain quantities as perturbations etc. In many 34 cases, a rigorous solution may not even exist. Several mixed-boundary value problems are discussed in <ref> [17] </ref>. The Green function technique solves this problem by finding charge distributions on the contacts which provide an approximately constant potential on the surface of the contacts.

Reference-contexts: Different authors use different subdivision schemes. The simplest scheme is to use uniform divisions. However, it is usually a non-optimal solution and a more efficient solution is to use finer grids near the edges of the contacts and coarse grids in the interior of the contact <ref> [18] </ref>. It must be clarified that while in the numerical scheme discussed earlier the entire substrate is meshed, this technique requires only the contacts to be meshed. This results in significantly smaller matrices. These matrices are however dense, compared to the numerical scheme which results in sparse matrices.

Reference-contexts: This results in significantly smaller matrices. These matrices are however dense, compared to the numerical scheme which results in sparse matrices. A uniform charge density has been used in this section. This is not necessary and spline approximations <ref> [19] </ref> can also be used. However using splines makes the evaluation of (48) more complicated. 3.2.3: Extraction of Substrate Parasitics The integrated-circuit substrate can be treated as a distributed resistance at low frequencies. <p> It is also easier to invert a symmetric matrix as discussed below. 3.2.4: Matrix Inversion Once the [p] matrix has been computed from the 2D FFT array, the matrix must be inverted to obtain 43 the [c] matrix. The matrix is first decomposed using the symmetric Choleski LU-decomposition technique <ref> [19] </ref>, followed by an inversion of the L matrix. The capacitors are then extracted from the inverse of the [L] matrix. 1 3.2.4.1: The Symmetric Choleski Decomposition This technique for LU decomposition is convenient for symmetric matrices. The U matrix is a transpose of the L matrix. <p> The above decomposition requires approximately N 3 /6 multiplications. Since [L] is a lower triangular matrix, so is [L] -1 . The inverse of [L] can be computed in a straightforward manner <ref> [19] </ref> and requires approximately N 3 /6 multiplications. The matrix of capacitive coefficients [c] is the product of [L] -1 and -[L] T --1 . For a single calculation of the capacitances, it is unnecessary to compute [c], as shown below.

Reference-contexts: The central partition and the eight partitions in its immediate neighborhood are of minimum area. The subsequent partitions grow by powers of three for distant contacts (Fig. 15c). Similar partitioning schemes have been used in the past in algorithms which employ the multipole approach <ref> [20] </ref>. The size of the [P] matrix to be inverted is reduced considerably by the use of the equivalent contacts to model distant contacts. A reduction in the size of [P] lowers the substrate simulator inversion time 3.

Reference-contexts: This is not a favorable environment for applications requiring high isolation since increasing the separation between the injector and receiver contacts is not helpful. For the case and , (curves 3-8), the isolation becomes independent of distance after a certain critical distance. Su et al. <ref> [21] </ref> found this critical distance to be four times the epitaxial thickness in their experiments. In fact, this distance is a function of the backplane impedance and varies from 2.5-5 times the epitaxial layer thickness (10mm) for L gnd in the range of 1-5nH at 1GHz. <p> The ability to incorporate these variations in a memory-efficient manner is an interesting problem. More efficient partitioning techniques can be explored (Section 3.2.5.2), to reduce the size of the substrate matrices. DC experimental verification was presented in this thesis. Experiments involving simple structures have been presented in <ref> [21] </ref> and [28]. More work needs to be done on the circuit-level aspects of substrate coupling at high-frequencies. Several theoretical predictions on guard rings were made in Chapter 4 which need to be experimentally verified at high-frequencies.

Reference-contexts: The inter-turn capacitance of the inductor is modeled by C ll . This model of the inductor is valid if the inductor is used below its self-resonance frequency. More detailed inductor models are presented in <ref> [22] </ref>. The three major parameters of interest in the inductor are the value of the inductance L, the self-resonance frequency of the inductor and the quality factor or Q of the inductor. The quality factor is defined as the per-unit-cycle energy stored to the power loss in the inductor. <p> The quality factor is defined as the per-unit-cycle energy stored to the power loss in the inductor. Typical Q factors of inductors fabricated in silicon processes are in the range of 3 to 10 <ref> [22] </ref>. The power-loss in the inductor is determined by the series and substrate resistors shown in Fig. 28b. The series loss is determined by the resistivity of the material used to fabricate the inductor and the length of the inductor winding.

Reference-contexts: As discussed in Section 2.0.1, DC currents are injected into the substrate by the avalanche-induced substrate currents in NMOSFETs, the leakage currents in device-to-substrate pn junctions and the parasitic pnp transistor in npn BJTs. Experimental evidence of the change in depletion capacitance in NMOSFETs was shown in <ref> [26] </ref>. These two mechanisms are discussed below. 4.2.3.1: The Substrate as a Feedback Path In order to examine the feedback path which exists through the substrate, we consider the BJT amplifier shown in Fig. 30. The partial circuit diagram of a cascade of common-emitter amplifiers is shown in the figure.
