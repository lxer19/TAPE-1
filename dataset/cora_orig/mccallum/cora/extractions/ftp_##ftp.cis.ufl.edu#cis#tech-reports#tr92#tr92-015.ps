Abstract: To achieve data sharing among heterogeneous database management systems, one essential step is the conversion of the schemata defined in the diverse data models used by these systems. A semantic preserving translation of different modeling constructs and constraints is necessary to ensure that the semantics of applications remain intact after the translation. In this paper, we present an objectoriented extensible core model (ORECOM) which is used as a neutral, intermediate model through which diverse modeling constructs and constraints are translated. The model provides very general and primitive structural constructs in the forms of objects and binary object associations for representing the structural properties of various high-level data models. It also provides behavioral constructs in the forms of operation specifications and semantic rules with triggers for capturing the semantic constraints of these high-level models. Different from the intermediate models used in the existing heterogeneous database management systems, ORECOM is developed for supporting the translation among objectoriented and semantically rich data models. It is extensible in the sense that new modeling constructs and constraints can be added by extending the primitives of ORECOM. This paper also describes the design and implementation of a data model and schema translation system which is being used to test the conversions between the constructs and constraints of data models such as IDEF-1X, NIAM, EXPRESS, and OSAM*. Applications of this system include schema sharing, database conversion, and semantics modification and extension of schema. The techniques and methodology developed in this system are also useful for schema integration and schema design.

Reference-contexts: A micro rule is defined in two parts: a trigger condition and a rule body. The trigger condition specifies a trigger time which can be "before", "after" or "in parallel", and an object operation described above. The rule body is specified as a well-formed-formula (wff) of an object calculus <ref> [KAME92] </ref>, which is evaluated to be either true or false when the rule is triggered. The object calculus is a pattern-based first-order logic used as the formalism for specifying the semantics of objectoriented databases.

Reference-contexts: Some of them can perform translations in either direction from any one of the three models to the others <ref> [BILL79, CARD80a,b, POTT84, GRAN84, JACO85, BREI86, CARD87] </ref>. Some can perform only specific translations such as the translations between the relational and network models [DEVO80, 5 KATZ80, LARS83], or the translations from the hierarchical or network model to the relational model [VASS80, HWAN83].

Reference-contexts: For this reason, the intermediate model should provide a low-level primitive semantic representation which serves as a neutral representation into which the high-level constructs of diverse data models can be translated. The approaches taken in <ref> [GRAN84, JACO85, SEN86, DEMU87, DEMU88, HSIA89] </ref> are the right direction in meeting this first requirement. However, their models can not be easily used as the intermediate model for the neutral representation of objectoriented data models. In our work, we use an objectoriented model as the intermediate model.

Reference-contexts: An important decision to be made for using the indirect translation approach is the selection of an intermediate model. Different data models have been used in the existing work. The E-R model in HD-DBMS [CARD80a,b, 87], the functional model in Multibase <ref> [SMIT81] </ref>, the ECR in DDTS [DEVO80], the IDEF-1X in IISS [IISS86], the attribute-based model in MLDS [DEMU87,88, HSIA89], the OSAM* in IMDAS [KRIS88], and the canonical model in PRECI [DEEN81] are just some examples. Other representations are also possible.

Reference-contexts: A constraint specification language based on the similar formalism has been reported in <ref> [SU91] </ref>. After having analyzed a number of semantically rich data models including IDEF-1X, NIAM, EXPRESS, E-R, OSAM*, etc., we have come to the conclusion that various types of semantic constraints captured by these high-level models can be very explicitly represented by micro-rules of the type described and illustrated above.

Reference-contexts: Some can perform only specific translations such as the translations between the relational and network models [DEVO80, 5 KATZ80, LARS83], or the translations from the hierarchical or network model to the relational model <ref> [VASS80, HWAN83] </ref>. After semantic data models such as E-R [CHEN76] and its variations, NIAM [VERH82], Iris [FISH87], etc., were introduced, the data model and schema translation efforts were extended to cover these data models [VASS80, SHIP81, MORG83, BRIA85, FLYN85, SEN86, LYNG87, ELMA89, DEMU87,88, LEUN88, HSIA89, OZKA90, etc.]. <p> The disadvantage of this approach is that the translation algorithms are pairwise specific and can not be used for all pairs of source and target models. Therefore, the two mappings between E-R and the relational model described in <ref> [VASS80] </ref> need two different algorithms; one for each direction.
