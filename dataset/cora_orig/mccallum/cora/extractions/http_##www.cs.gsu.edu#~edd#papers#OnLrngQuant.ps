Abstract: This paper reports on a study of students learning the concept of universal and exstential quantification in undergraduate mathematics courses in which the instruction was based on previous research into what it means to understand this concept. Following a theoretical analysis of the epistemology of quantification obtained in previous work, instruction is designed in which students construct mathematical concepts on a computer, using the mathematical programming language ISETL. The intention is that, as a result of making the computer constructions, students will tend to make effective mathemtical constructions in their minds. The 36 students in the study were sophomores and juniors with joint majors in mathematics and computer science who were taking a course in discrete mathematics. The two groups were at two different universities and the same instruction, with minor variations, was given to both groups. Results suggest that when the pedagogical approach described in this paper is used, students can develop some understanding of quantification and the ability to work with it, even when the particular problems they are given are difficult.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps more likely, they will construct ineffective procedures which some have called "bugs". Examples of this include the observations of students' 8 (and teachers') errors in solving the Student/Professor problem <ref> (Clement, Lochhead, & Soloway, 1980) </ref>, the "repairs" of Brown and vanLehn (Brown & vanLehn, 1980; vanLehn, 1980) misconceptions in Physics (DiSessa, 1985), the almost universal difficulty with Calculus (Douglas, 1986), and the trouble students have with implications (see the section, CONCLUSIONS for some indications of this).

The literature reports not only on the initial errors that students make, but on the persistence of misunderstandings and on the lack of success that education seems to have in eliminating them.

Reference-contexts: The students were expected to use conjunctions and disjunctions explicitly. It was considered that such an exercise would provide a transition to quantification. This idea follows a suggestion of D. Griese <ref> (Griese, 1981.) </ref> After the preliminary period, there was a single lecture during which there was explanation and discussion of propositions and the meaning (in mathematics) of the negation of a proposition.
