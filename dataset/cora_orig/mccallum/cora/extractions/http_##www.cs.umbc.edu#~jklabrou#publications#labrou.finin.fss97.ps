Title: Towards a standard for an Agent Communication Language  
Author: Yannis Labrou and Tim Finin 
Address: Baltimore, MD 21250, USA  
Affiliation: Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Department, University of Maryland, Baltimore County,  
Abstract: We discuss the problems of providing semantics for an Agent Communication Language standard and we briefly introduce an approach we have used to describe the semantics of the Agent Communication Language KQML. We argue that our approach adequately addresses or circumvents the aforementioned problems.

Reference-contexts: The issue of semantics for communication acts has received a fair share of attention. Cohen and Lesveque have introduced a model for rational agents <ref> (Cohen & Levesque 1990) </ref>, which uses a possible-worlds formalism, that can 1 For the FIPA ACL proposal, as of August 1997, check http://drogo.cselt.stet.it/fipa/spec/f7612.html in turn be used as a substrate for the semantic descrip-tion of illocutionary acts (Cohen & Levesque 1995; Smith & Cohen 1996).

Reference-contexts: Obviously, what "not provable" means will depend on the details of the particular agent system, for which we want to make no assumptions. A simple example that showcases our approach In <ref> (Labrou 1996) </ref> we provide the semantics for all the KQML performatives. We only present the case of tell to showcase our approach. tell (A,B,X) 1. A states to B that A believes the content to be true. 2. Bel (A,X) 3.
