Abstract: A novel scheme for evaluating test performance is introduced. The method combines complete test sets for individual target faults and non-target defects with a probabilistic model of ATPG to provide quantified measures of fortuitous non-target defect coverage. While complete test sets are more computationally expensive to derive than conventionally generated test vectors, the resulting measures of non-target defect coverage are much more reliable than those obtained from fault simulation due to the greatly enhanced statistical significance which is inherent in the procedure. The results suggest in particular that stuck-at fault testing may have a limited lifetime in light of the rapid decline of acceptable defect level.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, fault simulating a few high coverage target fault test sets for their non-target defect coverage results in a low level of statistical significance due to the very large number of unique test sets that often exist for a circuit <ref> [ABRA83] </ref>, [HUGH86], [MILL88], [MILL89]. In contrast, our method examines the properties of the entire set of one-vector-per-fault test sets. As will be shown in Section 6, the number of such test sets can exceed 3x10 405 for circuits as small as C432 [BRGL85] under a conservative set of assumptions. <p> Non-feedback bridging faults (NF-BFs) were chosen primarily because empiricism has indicated that feedback bridging faults (FBFs) are much more likely to be detected by stuck-at fault test sets than are NFBFs [MEI74], [MILL88]. Unlike the work of Abramovici and Menon <ref> [ABRA83] </ref>, our study includes both AND NFBFs and OR NFBFs to study the effect of the dominant logic value on test performance. The NFBF sets were reduced using the results of Theorem 2 of Mei [MEI74] to remove all NFBFs between two inputs to the same gate.

Reference-contexts: Gathering this type of information can be problematic for several reasons. Theoretical approaches have addressed mainly multiple stuck-at fault coverage by single stuck-at fault test sets and have therefore experienced limited utility <ref> [AGAR81] </ref>. However, the large number and diversity of solutions to the test generation problem precludes the possibility of developing a precise, analytical, and all-encompassing model of ATPG.

Reference-contexts: The target faults should obviously be stuck-at faults, given their wide acceptance in industry. The particular stuck-at fault sets chosen here are checkpoint faults which were minimized using simple gate equivalence rules <ref> [BOSS71] </ref>, [MCCL71]. Checkpoint faults were selected due to their frequent use as a target fault set. Gate equivalence was applied to minimize duplication of test set computations. The non-target defect sets used here are bridging faults.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, our method examines the properties of the entire set of one-vector-per-fault test sets. As will be shown in Section 6, the number of such test sets can exceed 3x10 405 for circuits as small as C432 <ref> [BRGL85] </ref> under a conservative set of assumptions. This paper presents a different approach to assess test quality which encompasses broader ranges of target fault test sets. This goal has necessitated 1 the development of a probabilistic model of ATPG, which we introduce. <p> The combination of Difference Propagation and a probabilistic model of ATPG are used to study fortuitous detection of non-target defects by complete target fault test sets. The circuits studied so far are the five smallest circuits from the combinational benchmarks <ref> [BRGL85] </ref>, a fulladder circuit, and the 74LS181 ALU. <p> For example, for the benchmark circuit C432 <ref> [BRGL85] </ref>, the mean number of vectors (of all 2 n input combinations) which detect a single stuck-at fault was found to be 3x10 9 tests [BUTL90a]. There are approximately 450 checkpoint stuck-at faults when they are minimized with gate equivalence.

Reference-contexts: Difference Propagation is a Boolean functional test generator employing ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs, <ref> [BRYA86] </ref>) which is capable of generating tests for more than just single stuck-at faults. Because we wish to study the general characteristics of many test sets, Difference Propagation's built-in feature of producing complete test sets for individual faults makes it ideal for this application. <p> Boolean functional techniques are ideally suited for this application. We have therefore developed a Boolean function based test generation system called Difference Propagation. By representing logical fault excitation and propagation conditions symbolically using OBDDs <ref> [BRYA86] </ref>, we are able to generate Boolean functions which describe the complete test sets for individual faults. Although Difference Propagation was implemented prior to Cho and Bryant's symbolic fault simulation system [CHO89], its explicit use of the differences between the good and defective machines resembles their application of that concept. <p> Because individual fault test sets are represented symbolically as OBDDs, target fault/non-target defect test set intersections can be found by simplying AND-ing the functions describing the target fault and non-target defect test sets using Bryant's Apply algorithm <ref> [BRYA86] </ref>. We can then find all the cardinalities used in Equation (4) by a simple minterm counting algorithm similar in nature to the one presented by Bryant. As stated previously, Mei's Theorem 2 was used to eliminate all NFBFs theoretically guaranteed to dominate stuck-at faults [MEI74].

Reference-contexts: This goal has necessitated 1 the development of a probabilistic model of ATPG, which we introduce. To couch our studies in terms of currently popular models of non-target defects, we have also conceptualized and implemented a flexible approach to logical test generation called Difference Propagation <ref> [BUTL90a] </ref>, an extension to previous research [GAED88]. Difference Propagation is a Boolean functional test generator employing ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs, [BRYA86]) which is capable of generating tests for more than just single stuck-at faults. <p> For example, for the benchmark circuit C432 [BRGL85], the mean number of vectors (of all 2 n input combinations) which detect a single stuck-at fault was found to be 3x10 9 tests <ref> [BUTL90a] </ref>. There are approximately 450 checkpoint stuck-at faults when they are minimized with gate equivalence. <p> Thus, Difference Propagation is not proposed as an alternative to conventional ATPG, and no performance comparisons will be made. The development of Difference Propagation is detailed in <ref> [BUTL90a] </ref>. 7 Fault Sets Having developed the ATPG model and the complete test set information, it is necessary to select sets of target faults and non-target defects for study. The target faults should obviously be stuck-at faults, given their wide acceptance in industry. <p> It is interesting to note that no NFBFs were found which would definitely escape detection should they occur. For circuits larger than the 74LS181, a fault sampling procedure had to be introduced due to the enormous number of candidate NFBFs in these circuits. This sampling process is described in <ref> [BUTL90a] </ref>. Thus, as circuit size increases, we are sampling increasingly smaller proportions of the entire population of non-target defects. Such a phenomenon obviously increases the likelihood that we will not locate the "most easily missed" non-target defect (s).

Although Difference Propagation was implemented prior to Cho and Bryant's symbolic fault simulation system <ref> [CHO89] </ref>, its explicit use of the differences between the good and defective machines resembles their application of that concept. Basically, Difference Propagation begins by calculating the function which describes the differences between the good and defective machines (for all input combinations) at the fault site.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The majority of ATPG research and existing ATPG systems are centered around the stuck-at fault model. This model was originally published by Eldred in 1959 <ref> [ELDR59] </ref>. The stuck-at fault model made sense then because typical machines built from discrete components often exhibited failure mechanisms characterized by fixed logical values. Certainly since Eldred's day we have seen the integrated circuit (IC) revolution which itself has witnessed changes in focus from bipolar to MOS-based technologies.

While all of this work is important and useful, we propose that a second very fundamental question relating as much to testing as to modeling must also be answered independently of the first. <p> The higher the likelihood that non-target defects occur, the more meaningful is the measure of test quality. The Inductive Fault Analysis research has indicated that these likelihoods seem to be increasing for certain classes of defects [SHEN85], <ref> [FERG88] </ref>. More importantly, the lower the acceptable defect level, the more critical it becomes to account for non-target defects, even if their occurrences are infrequent. 4 Fault Set Selectability The definition of the ATPG model permits more detailed study of how test sets for individual faults interact with one another.

The particular instances of bridging faults we have selected are the two line, non-feedback variety. Two-line faults are commonly used with the assumption that bridging faults of more than two lines are highly unlikely. We also desire our results to be as compatible with the literature as possible.

This is significant because these proportions of non-target defects are guaranteed to be detected by test sets which cover the corresponding target faults.

Reference-contexts: The limiting factor is not the speed at which the computations occur, but rather the memory requirements of the function representations. Recent developments have revealed many improvements in the implementation of function manipulation engines [MADR88], [BRAC90], [MINA90], <ref> [ROSS90] </ref>, [KIMU90]. The most promising of these appears to be that of Ross. This work introduces a new form of function representation that enables rapid calculations of vast amounts of functional information. <p> At that point, all remaining information is declared unknown. The implementation of an OPDD calculation system has demonstrated that often the majority of the functional information can be extracted from a circuit using modest memory resources <ref> [ROSS90] </ref>. Clearly, these techniques could be applied to the test quality evaluation problem. The unknown minterms would then cause the exact miss probabilities to become miss probability intervals.

Reference-contexts: For large circuits, defect levels today are typically on the order of 200 DPM. However, the value of defect level considered acceptable is declining rapidly. For example, the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) has set forth the ambitious goal of 1 DPM in circuits of 10 7 devices <ref> [SRC85] </ref>. This goal requires extremely high performance methods of testing as well as good measures of test quality. A defective circuit will pass the manufacturing test if the following two events both occur for at least one irredundant defect. 1. The defect is present in the circuit. 2.

Reference-contexts: These constant and increasingly frequent changes have brought into question the wisdom of adhering to the stuck-at fault model without further evaluation of its expected performance [WADS78], [GALI80], [NICK80], [BEH82], <ref> [SHEN85] </ref>, [FERG88], [LEVI90]. <p> Analysis <ref> [SHEN85] </ref>, [FERG88]. While all of this work is important and useful, we propose that a second very fundamental question relating as much to testing as to modeling must also be answered independently of the first. <p> The higher the likelihood that non-target defects occur, the more meaningful is the measure of test quality. The Inductive Fault Analysis research has indicated that these likelihoods seem to be increasing for certain classes of defects <ref> [SHEN85] </ref>, [FERG88]. <p> Bridging faults at this time seem to be the second most dominant fault model studied in the literature, single stuck-at faults being the first. This is largely because empirical research has indicated that many physical failure mechanisms manifest themselves as bridges [GALI80], <ref> [SHEN85] </ref>. The particular instances of bridging faults we have selected are the two line, non-feedback variety. Two-line faults are commonly used with the assumption that bridging faults of more than two lines are highly unlikely. We also desire our results to be as compatible with the literature as possible.

Reference-contexts: If we can now find values for p i , we can compute DL by using Equation (3). In Williams' and Brown's famous derivation of the defect level equation, they assume the p i has a uniform and equiprobable distribution <ref> [WILL81] </ref>. So p i is a constant, p. The yield, Y , of integrated circuits is the proportion of ICs produced which are not defective.
