Abstract: Function decomposition is a method that decomposes a dataset to an equivalent hierarchy of less complex datasets. In this article we show that function decomposition can contribute to feature transformation as a method for (1) discovery of a hierarchy of new features and (2) construction of features to be added to the original dataset. A particular advantage of function decomposition is its capability to identify appropriate subsets of existing features and discover functions that map each subset to a new feature. These functions are induced from examples and are not predefined in any way.
