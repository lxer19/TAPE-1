Reference-contexts: In both of these two papers, the authors evaluate the increase of the computation time of their algorithms when one allows weights belonging to some fixed interval [0; a] instead of 0 1 weights. Weight problems are also considered in a recent paper of Crescenti, Silvestri and Trevisan <ref> [CST96] </ref>. His main result is that for weighted problems satisfying a certain "niceness" property (these problems 2 include MAX-CUT) the approximability threshold for the unbounded version and that of a polynomially bounded version are equal. The plan of this paper is as follows.

Reference-contexts: The fact that condition (i) implies that the family F is dense can be established easily by adapting the proof of the law of large numbers in order to get an effective bound on the sample size. Actually, we will adapt a proof of Feller (see <ref> [Fe] </ref>) that he uses to show the convergence of the means of sums of independent r.v.'s to a not necessary constant specified function. The speed of convergence is governed by the function o .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Significant results concerning Polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS's) for "dense" instances of several N P-hard problems such as MAX-CUT, MAX-k-SAT, BISECTION, DENSE-k-SUBGRAPH, and others have been obtained recently in Arora, Karger and Karpinski [AKK94], Vernandez de la Vega <ref> [FV96] </ref>, Frieze and Kannan [AK97], Arora, Frieze and Kaplan [AFK95]. Still more recently, dense instances of approximation problems have been investigated from the point of view of the query complexity in Goldreich, Goldwasser and Ron [GGR96], Frieze and Kannan [AK97]. <p> Most algorithms in [AKK94] and those in <ref> [FV96] </ref> are based on the idea of exhaustive sampling: i) pick a small random set of vertices, ii) guess where they go in the optimum solution and, iii) use their placement to determine the placement of everything else. <p> Then, MAX-BISECTION and MAX-CUT both have PTAS when restricted to the instances corresponding to F . PROOF We give first the proof for MAX-BISECTION and then state briefly the required additions needed for MAX-CUT. The sampling property which makes the algorithm in <ref> [FV96] </ref>, see also [AKK94], work in the 0 1 case (altogether for MAX-BISECTION and MAX-CUT) is the following. Assume that F is a family of unweighted instances with density ff, say, and let fi satisfy ff=4 fi 1=2. <p> PROOF The proof which is technical and lengthy is omitted in this extended abstract. It can be found in Appendix 1. 2. We are now well prepared to prove the following lemma from which the approximability of MAX-BISECTION and MAX-CUT on dense weighted instances can easily be deduced (see <ref> [FV96] </ref>). Lemma (Sampling lemma) Let us assign to the edges of B (X; Y ) K n;n , the complete equilibrated bipartite graph on 2n vertices, weights whose empirical distribution F has mean 1 and belongs to some dense set F . <p> As mentioned before, the Sampling Lemma settles the case of MAX-BISECTION. This lemma gives in fact a PTAS for dense weighted MAX-CUT restricted to cuts with sides fin; (1 fi)n where fi is any fixed number in ]0; 1=2] and this fact was used in <ref> [FV96] </ref> to deduce a PTAS for MAX-CUT in the 0 1 case since then a strictly positive lower bound for the values of fi which to be considered can be obtained, depending only on the (usual) density and the required accuracy.

We know by <ref> [AK97] </ref> that all these problems are approximable in the dense unweighted case. Acknowledgement.

Reference-contexts: The natural instances of optimization problems (see the definitions given in <ref> [GJ79] </ref> involve weights while the results mentioned above deal mainly with the 0,1 case. We want to examine how these results can be extended to the weighted case.

(MAX-BISECTION is also called MAX-50/50-CUT or MAX-EQUI-CUT.) Our results extend easily to to other MAX-SNP problems such as Max-2SAT or Maximum Acyclic Subgraph. We note that weight problems have been briefly considered in <ref> [GGR96] </ref> and [AK97].

Reference-contexts: Now, when the distributions of the weights comes from a non-dense family F , the 13 density d achieves arbitrarily small values when F ranges over F . Thus, bearing in mind that MAX-BISECTION is MAX-SNP hard on 0 1 instances (see Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [PY91] </ref>), we should be done at this point apart from the apparently innocuous fact that, for each involved d, we are not required to solve MAX-BISECTION on all possible instances of density d, but only for a set of sizes which may be quite thin.
