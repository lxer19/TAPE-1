Reference-contexts: Scenario: Organize a Visit We illustrate the system architecture and the interactions of the information gathering agents in the visitor hosting scenario. A different variation of the hosting visitor task has also been explored by Kautz and his colleagues at Bell Labs <ref> (Kautz, Selman, & Coen 1994) </ref>. A visitor hosting agent should have the following capabilities: * It should automate information retrievals in terms of finding personnel information of potential meeting attendees. It should be able to access various on-line public databases and information resources at the disposal of the visit organizer.
