Abstract: Shape-based registration is a process for estimating the transformation between two shape representations of an object. It is used in many image-guided surgical systems to establish a transformation between pre and intra-operative coordinate systems. This paper describes several tools which are useful for improving the accuracy resulting from shape-based registration: constraint analysis, constraint synthesis, and online accuracy estimation. Constraint analysis provides a scalar measure of sensitivity which is well correlated with registration accuracy. This measure can be used as a criterion function by constraint synthesis, an optimization process which generates configurations of registration data which maximize expected accuracy. Online accuracy estimation uses a conventional root-mean-squared error measure coupled with constraint analysis to estimate an upper bound on true registration error. This paper demonstrates that registration ac-curacy can be significantly improved via application of these methods. Keywords: geometric constraint analysis, geometric constraint synthesis, online accuracy estimation, shaped-based registration, intra-operative registration.

Reference-contexts: Genetic algorithms (GAs) are biologically motivated adaptive systems based upon principles of natural selection and genetic recombination which attempt to avoid local minima. A simplified model of the GA called Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) was recently introduced <ref> [1] </ref>. For the purposes of this paper, PBIL can be thought of as a black-box with the following inputs: the set of allowable vertices, V; the number of points in the configuration set, P; a function which computes NAI (P) based upon the surface Model; and a stopping criterion.

Reference-contexts: There are many approaches to registration for image-guided surgery and an excellent review can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. A class of registration methods referred to as shape-based methods uses representations of object shape to estimate the required transformation. Representations are constructed using data collected in the two coordinate systems (i.e., pre and intra-operative).

Reference-contexts: This result is similar to one presented in the con-text of industrial inspection <ref> [6] </ref>. From (7) it can be seen that the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, represents the direction of maximum constraint.

Reference-contexts: As demonstrated below, sets of discrete points, P, which have well-conditioned scatter matrices, , are preferable to sets which have ill-conditioned scatter matrices for achieving accurate registration. In this work, the noise amplification in-dex (NAI) <ref> [7] </ref> is used as a measure of matrix conditioning and is defined as (8) This quantity is the product of the inverse condition number and the square root of the minimum eigenvalue, and provides an upper bound on the amplification of residual errors (e.g., discrete point Data measurement noise, and errors <p> as (8) This quantity is the product of the inverse condition number and the square root of the minimum eigenvalue, and provides an upper bound on the amplification of residual errors (e.g., discrete point Data measurement noise, and errors in the Model) to the esti-mated parameters (e.g., registration transformation parameters) <ref> [7] </ref>. Scale and Coordinate System Dependences In constraint analysis, there is an implicit weighting factor related to object size which determines the relative importance of rotational versus translational errors.

Reference-contexts: Details of shape-based registration methods can be found in [2][3][5], and descriptions of the methods used in this work appear in <ref> [8] </ref>. Due to fundamental similarities among shape-based registration solution methods, the techniques proposed in this paper are independent of the particu-lar registration solution method used. Solving the registration problem results in an estimate, T est , of the true (and usually unknown) registration transformation, T true . <p> The gradient of D with respect to is a 6-vector, (5) where is the unit normal to the surface at the point <ref> [8] </ref>. This result can be extended to consider the effect of perturbing a collection of points with respect to the surface: (6) The scalar quantity is a first order approximation of the least-squared error of (1). <p> A solution to this problem is to pre-normalize the Model so that the average radius as measured about the origin is unity. This has the effect of weighting rotational and translational components equally, on average. A complete discussion of the scale dependence problem can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. Constraint analysis has a dependence upon the location of the origin of the Model coordinate system arising from the term on the right hand side of (5). <p> For a given Model, it can be shown that maximal sensitivity of constraint analysis is achieved when the constraint analysis coordinate system origin is located at the centroid of the Model <ref> [8] </ref>. 2.2 Constraint Synthesis The goal of constraint synthesis is to automatically generate Data sets which maximize the NAI for a given Model and a fixed number of points. <p> A search algorithm for solving constraint synthesis which combines hillclimbing and a non-deterministic optimization method is described below. A complete description of constraint synthesis so-lution methods can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. Hybrid PBIL / Hillclimbing Search Algorithm In next ascent hillclimbing (NAH), M vertices are chosen from the set of possible vertices, V, and placed into the selected set P. Let NAI (P) represent the value of the NAI computed from (5) - (8) using the points in P. <p> Certain Data configurations are more stable than others (i.e., there is N 5000 M 50, less NAI variation as the points in P are perturbed about the DCP positions). Attempts to incorporate stability criteria into the constraint synthesis process have resulted in exponential complexity <ref> [8] </ref>. Nevertheless, improved stability can be achieved via two methods: navigational guidance during Data collection and high curvature filtering. During the data acquisition process, it is possible to use the current registration transformation estimate to provide navigational guidance to the human Data collector. <p> After low curvature points are collected and collection uncertainty is reduced, points in higher curvature regions can be collected. To implement this, several DCPs are synthesized, some with points in regions of low curvature and others in regions of higher curvature <ref> [8] </ref>. The resulting DCPs can then be used to guide the collection process. 3 Results This section demonstrates significant improvement in registration accuracy due to the proposed methods. <p> Fig. 7 shows a plot of MCE versus RMS error (definition in the figure). It is shown in <ref> [8] </ref> that the slope of the line which relates worst case MCE to RMS error is independent of sensor noise, the number of Data points, and Data collection uncertainty, assuming that the effective NAI value is slightly greater than zero.

Reference-contexts: Online accuracy estimation provides an upper bound on true registration accuracy based upon a conventional root-mean-squared error. The proposed methods have been investigated in-vitro on cadaveric specimens and via simulation studies and are currently being incorporated into a clinical image-guided or-thopaedic surgical application <ref> [9] </ref>. The current paper describes the methods, reports encouraging results, and suggests approaches for incorporating the methods into clinically viable registration systems. 2 Methods This paper focuses on a special case of shape-based registration: surface-based registration with discrete point data.

Reference-contexts: Registration estimates a transformation which aligns one shape representation with the other in a manner which minimizes a measure of the dis-tance between them. Several factors affect shape-based registration accuracy, including: errors in the shape representations due to sensor noise or shape reconstruction errors <ref> [11] </ref>; the quantity of registration data; and the locations on the registration object from which the data are collected [10]. This paper addresses the problem of improving shape-based registration * This work was supported in part by a National Challenge grant from the NSF (IRI-9422734). <p> For these experiments, estimation of T true is a challenging engineering problem which our group has solved using a highly accurate fiducial-based registration method <ref> [11] </ref>. Using a filtered version of the femur Model, DCPs of 6 and 50 points were synthesized, each a total of 5 times. The corresponding Data points were collected on the actual femur using a digitizing probe. Each synthesized configuration was independently collected 5 times.
