Abstract: It has been recognized that the Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) scheme is one of the most promising ways to exploit the enormous bandwidth in a single mode optical fiber. In this paper, we focus on using fixed wavelength transmitters and fixed wavelength receivers (which are considered to be more economically and technically feasible) to construct Wavelength and Time Division Multiplexed (WTDM) networks based on passive star couplers. We present some general principles to construct such networks based on regular graphs. In particular, we discuss how to apply the principles to the following well-known regular graphs: perfect shuffle, generalized perfect shu*e and hypercube. The proposed algorithm supports a wider range of design alternatives than most of the previously proposed schemes. We also study the performance impact of different design parameters and conclude with several optimal design strategies. Theoretical bounds for performance metrics subject to different environments are also presented.

Reference-contexts: How can this generally be done in WTDM networks? Several approaches, which have been proposed, arrange connection graphs in certain regular patterns. By doing so, routing scheme and wavelength assignment are simplified and performance analysis becomes tractable. For instance, the (p, k)- Shu*eNet proposed in <ref> [6] </ref> uses one transmitter and one receiver in each station to realize a re-circulating multistage perfect shu*e connection graph, where p and k are the nodal degree and the number of stages of the graph, respectively. <p> Figure 5 shows the connectivity between transmitters and receivers in bipartite graphs. In this case, W max = 4, ff min = 4. 17 4.4 Flexibility and Embedding Efficiency The proposed construction scheme offers a greater degree of design flexibility than those previously proposed in <ref> [6, 11] </ref>. Consider the scheme proposed in Shu*eNet [6] where edges are partitioned into N m sets according to a specific pattern and each set requires T R wavelength. The same approach can also be applied to the (generalized) perfect shu*e. Then we have W = NT R m . <p> In this case, W max = 4, ff min = 4. 17 4.4 Flexibility and Embedding Efficiency The proposed construction scheme offers a greater degree of design flexibility than those previously proposed in [6, 11]. Consider the scheme proposed in Shu*eNet <ref> [6] </ref> where edges are partitioned into N m sets according to a specific pattern and each set requires T R wavelength. The same approach can also be applied to the (generalized) perfect shu*e. Then we have W = NT R m . <p> The same approach can also be applied to the (generalized) perfect shu*e. Then we have W = NT R m . However, using the proposed scheme, W = NT R Cm . Essentially the scheme proposed in Shu*eNet <ref> [6] </ref> can be treated as a special case of the proposed scheme with C = 1. By adjusting the factor C, we can exploit other alternatives such as graphs with different m's but the same W or with different W 's but the same m.

Reference-contexts: The protocol is to divide a wavelength into several subchannels either by means of a time-division multiplexing (TDM) technique which allows several transmitters to share the same wavelength along the time domain <ref> [7, 8] </ref> or by means of a subcarrier multiplexing technique where each transmitter uses a specific subcarrier frequency within a wavelength to transmit [9, 10]. In this paper, we focus on the one employing the TDM protocol. <p> However, no formal description on wavelength assignment was given. How the design parameters (e.g., the topology of the connection graphs, the signal propagation delay, T and R) affect performance (e.g., throughput and the average packet delay) was not fully discussed.

Reference-contexts: However, the results of all the aforementioned works are limited to the case of (T = R = 1) and are hard to be extend to the case of (T; R &gt; 1). <ref> [11] </ref> proposed a scheme to construct hypercube networks using multiple star couplers. The scheme can be easily adopted into an environment with a single passive star by replacing each star coupler with a wavelength. <p> Figure 5 shows the connectivity between transmitters and receivers in bipartite graphs. In this case, W max = 4, ff min = 4. 17 4.4 Flexibility and Embedding Efficiency The proposed construction scheme offers a greater degree of design flexibility than those previously proposed in <ref> [6, 11] </ref>. Consider the scheme proposed in Shu*eNet [6] where edges are partitioned into N m sets according to a specific pattern and each set requires T R wavelength. The same approach can also be applied to the (generalized) perfect shu*e. Then we have W = NT R m . <p> By adjusting the factor C, we can exploit other alternatives such as graphs with different m's but the same W or with different W 's but the same m. Next consider the case of the hypercube. Related work has been done by Dowd <ref> [11] </ref>, where one passive star coupler is designated for interconnecting all the nodes with addresses differing in a specific digit. In total there are Nn m passive star couplers necessary. Each node has n transmitters and n receivers which may or may not be tunable. <p> On the other hand, the proposed scheme does not require T and R equal to n and has a much more flexible formula for W . Thus more alternatives can be offered. In fact, it is easy to verify that the Dowd's <ref> [11] </ref> scheme is a special case of the proposed scheme with T = R = n and m &gt; 2. Regarding the edge utilization, j, for the (generalized) perfect shu*e j equals 1 C and is independent of T and R.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown <ref> [12] </ref> that diameter of a generalized shu*e-exchange network equals dlog m N e, and shortest path routing can also be performed in O (log m N). As before, outgoing edges (incoming edges) are partitioned into T t-sections (R r-sections) with a transmitter (receiver) responsible for each t-section (r-section).
