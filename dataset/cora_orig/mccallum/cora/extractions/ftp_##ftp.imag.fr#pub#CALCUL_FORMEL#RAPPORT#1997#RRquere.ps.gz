Pubnum: LIP6  
Abstract: In this article, we present a new method to compute minimal bases for the kernel of a polynomial matrix. This method uses the computation of Pade approx-imants for the special case where one does not look after an approximation but an exact value. For a polynomial matrix of order m and degree d, its cost is about O(m 4 d 2 ) which may be better of the cost of a previous method by Beleen and Van Dooren [4].

Reference-contexts: are formal series like in problem of Pade approximants, but a polynomial matrix, we know that it exists an approximation order N such that a base for the solution of (1) describe the solutions of minimal degrees of M (z)p (z) = 0: Moreover, recents methods, from Beckermann and Labahn <ref> [1] </ref> and Van Barel and Bultheel [9], to compute vector Pade approximant, give the solution in the form of special bases which look like minimal bases. Using these methods specialized to our case, we find a cost about O (m 4 d 2 ) arithmetic operations. <p> In the section 2 of this paper we give the definition and some properties of a minimal base. The section 3 is devoted to the description of the vector Hermite-Pade problem and to its solutions given by <ref> [8, 9, 1] </ref>.

Section 5 give a simplified description of the algorithm of [1] specialized to our case. We give a specialization of the cost for this algorithm in section 6. 2 Minimal bases In this section we recall the definition and some properties of a minimal base. <p> Property 1 The column of a (p; m) polynomial matrix B (z) describe a minimal base iff rank (B (z)) = m and the matrix B (z) is column reduced. 3 Pade approximants The vector Hermite-Pade problem is described in <ref> [1] </ref> as Problem 1 Let m, p, and N be integers, m, p 2. Let F 1 (z), F 2 (z), ..., F m (z) be in K p [[z]], and let n= (n 1 ; :::; n m ) be a multiin-dex. <p> The solution to this problem is given into the form of s-reduced base [9] or oe-base, oe = N , <ref> [1] </ref> for the K p [z] submodule defined by the equation (2). In [7] it is shown that the two notions (s-reduced base and oe-base) are equivalent in the case of vector Hermite-Pade problem. <p> In [7] it is shown that the two notions (s-reduced base and oe-base) are equivalent in the case of vector Hermite-Pade problem. Although the components of such a base do not satisfy the degree conditions, they allow to describe all the solutions of the vector Hermite-Pade problem <ref> [9, 1] </ref>. We will describe now the notion of s-reduced base, then it will be obvious that it is a general ization of the notion of minimal base. <p> In <ref> [9, 1] </ref>, the solution to the vector Hermite-Pade problem of order N is given by a s-reduced base of the submodule S N defined by the equation (2). The components of such a base do not verify the problem because they do not verify the degree conditions. <p> The components of such a base do not verify the problem because they do not verify the degree conditions. Nevertheless, they allow to parametrize all solutions of the problem <ref> [9, 1] </ref>, this property is a consequence of the next theorem. <p> We have l X (deg (b i + (d 1)) md 1 thus, if we assume that l &gt; 0, that is ker (F (z)) 6= ;, i=1 (m 1)d Using the algorithms given by <ref> [9, 1] </ref> to compute solutions of the vector Hermite-Pade problem for a (p; m) polynomial matrix F (z) of degree d, for an order md + 1, it is possible to obtain a minimal base for ker (F (z)). <p> In the next section, we present a specialization of an algorithm by <ref> [1] </ref>. 5 Algorithm The algorithm described here is a matriciel version of the algorithm given by [1] to compute oe-base for a matrix F (z) of formal series. As we have said before, in our context, oe-base is the same notion as s-reduced base. <p> In the next section, we present a specialization of an algorithm by <ref> [1] </ref>. 5 Algorithm The algorithm described here is a matriciel version of the algorithm given by [1] to compute oe-base for a matrix F (z) of formal series. As we have said before, in our context, oe-base is the same notion as s-reduced base. Moreover 4 we specify this algorithm to our particular case of computation of minimal base. <p> According to theorems 2 and 3, we know that if N md + 1, the base P (N) (z) contains a minimal base for ker (F (z)). The cost given in <ref> [1] </ref> does not consider the particularity of the problem when s = (0; :::; 0) and F (z) is a polynomial matrix. So we will give a specialization of this cost in our case in the next section. On the other hand, in [1], the authors use a kind of linearization <p> The cost given in <ref> [1] </ref> does not consider the particularity of the problem when s = (0; :::; 0) and F (z) is a polynomial matrix. So we will give a specialization of this cost in our case in the next section. On the other hand, in [1], the authors use a kind of linearization of the problem (and then of the algorithm), and present a fast algorithm based on recursivness and FFT fast polynomial multiplications. <p> For a given r, the column p of P (i1) is called the pivot. When a column is a pivot, it is multiplied by z and its degree increase, then (at the step i) a column p of P (i1) may be the pivot for one r 2 <ref> [1; p] </ref> only. Moreover, when a column of P (i1) is a pivot, it will not take place anymore in the operation called "elimination" in the algorithm (during the step i). <p> Moreover, to compute the cost of this new method, we do not take all the advantages of the results from <ref> [1] </ref> about Pade approximants computation. So we hope that our theoretical cost can decrease.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A minimal base for a submodule M of K p [z] is a base which components have minimal degrees <ref> [5] </ref>. The computation of a minimal base for the kernel of a polynomial matrix M (z) may be useful to establish the singular part of a matrix pencil (when M (z) is a matrix pencil) [6], or to find some special form for polynomial matrix like column reduced form [7]. <p> Minimal bases for a submodule M are not uniquely defined, but all of them have the same set of degrees fdeg (b i ); 1 i mg. These degrees are sometime called the Forney dynamical indices <ref> [5] </ref>. We will often describe a base B = (b 1 (z); :::; b m (z)) using the matrice B (z) = b 1 (z) ::: b m (z) Definition 2 Given a (n; m) polynomial matrix P (z).
