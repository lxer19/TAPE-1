Abstract: Cai and Selman [CS96] defined a modification and extension of Levin's notion of average polynomial time to arbitrary time-bounds and proved that if L is P-bi-immune, then for every polynomial-time computable distribution , the distributional problem (L; ) is not polynomial on the -average. We prove the following consequences of the hypothesis that the p-measure of NP is not 0: 1. There is a language L that is not P-bi-immune and for every polynomial-time computable distribution , the distributional problem (L; ) is not

Reference-contexts: Proof. The hypothesis implies existence of a P-bi-immune set B 0 in NP. Since every P-printable set belongs to P, no infinite subset of B 0 is P-printable. Thus, by a result that Allender and Rubinstein <ref> [AR88] </ref> attribute to D. Russo, there exists a set B 2 P with the same property. 2 Proof. The proof of Theorem 3 proceeds as follows: Let A be any set that is DTIME (2 n 3 )-complex. We define L = A [ B.

Reference-contexts: According to the definition of Ben David et al. L is 2 n on the -average for every polynomial-time computable distribution . To avoid this, Cai and Selman <ref> [CS96] </ref> formulated a definition of T on the average that requires, for every n, that the expectation over the set A n = fx j jxj ng, with respect to the conditional distribution over A n , be less than or equal to 1. <p> The motivation and effect of this requirement is to remove dependency on any finite set of inputs. As a consequence of their definition, Cai and Selman <ref> [CS96] </ref> prove a hierarchy theorem for arbitrary average-case time-bounds that is as tight as the Hartmanis-Stearns [HS65] hierarchy theorem for worst-case deterministic time. Consider for a moment the fundamental question of what it means for a language L to be difficult to recognize. <p> Let us say that a language is distributionally-hard to recognize if for every polynomial-time computable distribution , the distributional problem (L; ) 62 AVP; i.e., for every , no Turing machine that accepts L has a running-time that is polynomial on the -average. Cai and Selman <ref> [CS96] </ref> proved, as a consequence of their hierarchy theorem, that every P-bi-immune language is distributionally-hard to recognize. Here we prove, assuming that the p-measure of NP is not 0, that there exist distributionally-hard to recognize languages that are not P-bi-immune. <p> For any time-constructible function T that is monotonically increasing, and hence invertible, Cai and Selman <ref> [CS96] </ref> define T on the -average as follows 1 : Let be a distribution on fl , and let W n = (fx : jxj ng). <p> Define AVP = S k1 AVTIME (n k ). Clearly, AVP Average-P. A distribution is reasonable if there exists s &gt; 0 such that W n = n s . We will require the following results of Cai and Selman <ref> [CS96] </ref> and Gurevich [Gur91]. Theorem 1 1. If is a reasonable distribution, then (L; ) belongs to Average-P (Levin's definition) if and only if (L; ) belongs to AVP (Cai and Selman's definition). 2. <p> Mayordomo [May94] proved that the p-measure of the class of P-bi-immune sets is 1, and therefore, if the p-measure of NP is not 0, then NP contains a P-bi-immune 7 set. Cai and Selman <ref> [CS96] </ref> proved, for all P-bi-immune sets L and for all polynomial--time computable distributions , that (L; ) 62 AVP. <p> Remember that all distributions throughout are computable in polynomial time. 1. The set has p-measure 1. Proof. Every P-bi-immune set belongs to this set <ref> [CS96] </ref>, and the p-measure of the P-bi-immune sets is 1 [May94]. 2 2. The set S 2 = fL j for all reasonable ; (L; ) =2 AV P g has p-measure 1, because every P-bi-immune set belongs to S 2 . 3.

According to the definition of Ben David et al. L is 2 n on the -average for every polynomial-time computable distribution .

If is computable in polynomial time, then the density function 0 is computable in polynomial time. (The converse is false unless P = NP <ref> [Gur91] </ref>.) Also, we explicitly exclude from consideration distributions for which 0 (x) = 0 for all but a finite number of strings x. Consideration of such distributions would allow every problem to be an essentially finite problem. <p> Define AVP = S k1 AVTIME (n k ). Clearly, AVP Average-P.

Reference-contexts: Lutz has hypothesized that neither the p-measure nor the p 2 -measure of NP is 0, and from these strong hypotheses he and others have derived several consequences that do not seem to follow from weaker hypotheses <ref> [May94, LM94] </ref>. The p-measure of P is 0, and we expect that NP is quantitatively different from P. Thus, results of the form "If A, then the p i -measure of NP is 0" provide evidence that A is false.

The set has p-measure 1. Proof. Every P-bi-immune set belongs to this set [CS96], and the p-measure of the P-bi-immune sets is 1 <ref> [May94] </ref>. 2 2.

From results of Mayordomo <ref> [May94] </ref>, we know that if the p 2 -measure of NP is not 0, then there is a set A in NP that is DTIME (2 n 3 )-bi-immune. The same hypothesis implies that the p-measure of NP is not 0, from which Lemma 2 still applies.

Reference-contexts: Thus, if NP does not have p-measure 0, then there is a language L such that for every polynomial-time computable distribution , the distributional problem (L; ) belongs to DistNP but does not belong to AVP. (Independently, Schuler and Yamakami <ref> [SY95] </ref> obtained a similar result.) Before turning to our main results, first we will use resource-bounded measure to make a series of simple observations that pinpoint some of the issues that we have been raising.
