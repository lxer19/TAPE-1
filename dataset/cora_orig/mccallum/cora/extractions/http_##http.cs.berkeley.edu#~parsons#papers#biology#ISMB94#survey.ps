Abstract: Some of the geometric problems of interest to molecular biologists have macroscopic analogues in the field of robotics. Two examples of such analogies are those between protein docking and model-based perception, and between ring closure and inverse kinematics. Molecular dynamics simulation, too, has much in common with the study of robot dynamics. In this paper we give a brief survey of recent work on these and related problems.

Reference-contexts: This latter problem has been well studied, and efficient and numerically stable solutions are available (e.g. in the package LAPACK, described in <ref> (Anderson et al. 1992) </ref>). The running times reported on some of the same test cases used in (Wampler & Morgan 1991) are 11 milliseconds on average (the slowest was 25 milliseconds).

Reference-contexts: He developed closed-form solutions for certain special geometries, such as when any three consecutive joint axes intersect in a common point. (Partly because this condition simplifies the analysis of the system so much, many common industrial robots are designed to be in this class; see e.g. <ref> (Craig 1989) </ref>.) Pieper also formulates the general 6R problem with a single polynomial in one variable. Solving this polynomial by numerical methods is not possible in practice, since its degree is around 64,000.

Reference-contexts: The methods developed for the latter problem (Manocha & Canny 1992) may well find useful application to the former. Other analogies are not hard to envision; for example, the "distance geometry" problem <ref> (Crippen & Havel 1988) </ref>, which arises in the context of interpreting NMR data, bears a certain resemblance to the forward kinematics problem for parallel manipulators such as the Stewart platform (Murray, Li, & Sastry 1994).

Reference-contexts: Ultimately, any approach which attempts to examine all geometrically possible conformations must fail for larger molecules. The number of such conformations has been estimated at (1:7) n for a polypeptide backbone, where n is the number of degrees of freedom, or (1:4) n if only compact conformations are considered <ref> (Dill 1985) </ref>. One simple approach which abandons the goal of examining all possible conformations is the "build-up" procedure (Gibson & Scheraga 1987). In this approach, systematic search is applied to short segments of the molecule, and the molecule is built up by combining only the lowest-energy conformations of these segments.

Reference-contexts: Two examples of structure prediction problems are the protein folding and ring closure problems. The long-term goal of protein folding is to predict native protein structures using only knowledge of the amino acid sequence. This ambitious goal has sparked much attention and research (see overview in <ref> (Dill 1993) </ref>); the best algorithms, however, still run too slowly on large proteins by factors of at least 10 6 for computing a complete and accurate folding.

Reference-contexts: Solving this polynomial by numerical methods is not possible in practice, since its degree is around 64,000. Subsequently, a non-constructive proof of an upper bound of 32 on the number of possible solutions was given in (Roth, Rastegar, & Scheinman 1974), and <ref> (Duffy & Crane 1980) </ref> gives a 32 nd degree polynomial in the tangent of one of the half-angles, which a numerical method could in principle use to solve for the joint angles. A different constructive approach was reported in (Tsai & Morgan 1985). <p> There the problem is cast as a system of eight second-degree polynomials in eight variables, and a ho-motopy method (also called a polynomial continuation method) is used to solve this system. (Primrose 1986) later showed that 16 of the solutions to the 32 nd degree polynomial of <ref> (Duffy & Crane 1980) </ref> must have non-zero imaginary parts, proving an upper bound of 16 on the number of real solutions. Subsequently a 16 th degree "input-output" polynomial was derived in (Raghavan & Roth 1989).

Reference-contexts: Also, proteins in nature have a remarkable ability to fold relatively quickly to their unique thermodynamically minimal conformations; recent evidence suggests that many of the important secondary structural elements of proteins form within the first few milliseconds during folding <ref> (Dyson & Wright 1993) </ref>. This "existence proof" of a fast algorithm strongly suggests that exhaustive search is overkill. Some protein folding methods attempt to imitate the success of nature directly. One such approach relies on searching a database of known molecular conformations for similar protein fragments.

Reference-contexts: That they were both published in the same year suggests that the authors might have found an opportunity to share ideas very useful. The interpretation tree idea has been applied to many different variations on the theme of object recognition and localization in robotics (for a discussion, see <ref> (Faugeras 1993) </ref>). Another successful paradigm is called geometric hashing (Lamdan & Wolfson 1988). The idea is to invert the natural "imaging" mapping from the set of possible interpretations of the data to the set of sensor readings. The inversion is made possible by a hash table data structure.

Reference-contexts: The case of kinematic chains with 6 degrees of freedom is important in robotics, since this is the minimum number necessary for the robot to span a full-rank subset of position-orientation space (SE (3)). Indeed, the general 6R case was once dubbed the "Mount Everest" of inverse kinematic problems <ref> (Freudenstein 1973) </ref>! Although kinematic chains with 7 degrees of freedom have been considered (Waldron & Reidy 1986), the complexity of controlling such robots makes them impractical, and hence higher-dimensional inverse kinematics has not received as much attention.

Reference-contexts: Finding a maximal matching reduces to searching for maximal cliques in this graph. Although clique-finding is known to be an NP-hard problem <ref> (Garey & Johnson 1979) </ref>, the authors argue that their approach is efficient in practice due to the geometric nature of the constraints imposed by the distances.

Reference-contexts: It has been recommended that searches for low-energy conformations run initially using a model with as few parameters as possible, and then continue if necessary in a larger search space as a means of refinement <ref> (Go & Scheraga 1970) </ref>. A good survey of conformational search techniques is (Howard & Kollman 1988). The easiest exhaustive searching technique to describe is called grid search. <p> Because these are considered fixed quantities, the molecule is parametrized by its dihedral angles. The seminal paper in this area is <ref> (Go & Scheraga 1970) </ref>. Its authors were interested in finding valid conformations of a single-loop molecule with n of its dihedral angles considered free (any others are considered parts of a rigid chain). They prove that such a molecule has n 6 degrees of freedom. <p> The history of work on the 6R inverse kinematics problem is about as recent as that of the ring closure problem. Whereas the attention of molecular biologists turned toward higher-dimensional problems and hence away from the algebraic approach initiated by <ref> (Go & Scheraga 1970) </ref>, robotics researchers pursued algebraic techniques to a quite satisfactory solution. The next two paragraphs sketch the history of this effort. The earliest published work on 6R inverse kinematics is that reported by Donald Pieper in his Ph.D. thesis (Pieper 1968). <p> In contrast, in molecular biology there is no such intrinsic reason to stop at 6 degrees of freedom. On the contrary, the ability to compute closed-ring conformations for larger rings would be very useful. One obvious approach to this is to apply the original proceedure of <ref> (Go & Scheraga 1970) </ref>, but using the fast inverse kinematics procedure of (Manocha & Canny 1992) to close the loop.

Reference-contexts: A promising alternative approach is that of <ref> (Jain, Vaidehi, & Rodriguez 1993) </ref>, which parametrizes the molecule with generalized internal variables (e.g. dihedral angles), thus allowing bond lengths and angles to be constrained directly. The algorithm works not only for chain molecules, but for more general tree-topology molecules as well. <p> Conclusions In this paper, we have discussed similarities between various problems in molecular biology and robotics. In two of these areas, namely geometric matching and dynamics simulation, interdisciplinary research efforts are already yielding promising results for structural biology (Norel et al. 1994), <ref> (Jain, Vaidehi, & Rodriguez 1993) </ref>. We have also discussed the highly analogous situation between the problems of molecular ring closure and the inverse kinematics of serial manipulators. The methods developed for the latter problem (Manocha & Canny 1992) may well find useful application to the former.

Reference-contexts: When X-ray crystallographic data is available, this approximation can be justified by comparing the experimental structures of bound complexes with those of their free components <ref> (Janin & Chothia 1990) </ref>; most known associating proteins (but not all) are observed to behave as rigid bodies.

Reference-contexts: the "ridges" on the surface of the ligand and another set which fill the "grooves" on the receptor surface. (That is, ligand spheres lie on the inside of the ligand, while the receptor's spheres lie on its outside.) Proteins have also been modelled with sets of cubes for docking purposes <ref> (Jiang & Kim 1991) </ref>. Applying direct search methods in the six-dimensional conformational space SE (3) is usually considered computationally infeasible. <p> Whenever at least 4 matches are made, an orientation is uniquely defined and the match is retained as a candidate for energy evaluation (assuming it passes a handedness test and some other simple geometric filters). The last algorithm we consider is the "soft docking" procedure of <ref> (Jiang & Kim 1991) </ref>. They do a form of exhaustive search in the six-dimensional conforma-tional space. The set SO (3) of rotations is discretized, and for each discrete rotation a set of translations which cause the cube sets representing the molecules to come into contact is computed. <p> Extensive tests on real data of these last two algorithms described have been reported in their respective papers ((Kuntz et al. 1982) and (Shoichet & Kuntz 1991) for DOCK, <ref> (Jiang & Kim 1991) </ref> for soft docking). For the purposes of evaluation, these tests were performed on pairs of molecules for which high-resolution X-ray crystallography data is available for the docked complexes, such as trypsin with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor.

Reference-contexts: Various different types of features have been used in the matching process. In <ref> (Kuhl, Crippen, & Friesen 1984) </ref>, the features of the ligand are the atoms on its surface, considered as point masses, while the receptor features are "site points", which may be thought of as the centers of pockets in the molecular surface of the receptor into which ligand atoms may be placed. <p> Applying direct search methods in the six-dimensional conformational space SE (3) is usually considered computationally infeasible. Instead, most of the docking algorithms reviewed here employ a combinatorial approach, based on pairwise matchings between individual features from the two molecules. <ref> (Kuhl, Crippen, & Friesen 1984) </ref> defines the docking problem as that of finding a relative configuration which maximizes the number of pairwise contacts made, where a ligand atom and a receptor site point are considered to be in contact in a given configuration if the distance between them is less than <p> is a way of accounting for errors in sensing or modeling. (Similar constraints can be derived for other feature types; angle constraints involving triples of matchings are also possible.) Note that the graph G of the distance constraints between matchings is exactly the complement of the docking graph defined in <ref> (Kuhl, Crippen, & Friesen 1984) </ref>; therefore, a maximal independent set of vertices in G corresponds to a maximal clique in the docking graph, and hence to an interpretation with the maximum possible number of matches. <p> At a leaf of the three-level tree, the remaining m 3 data points can be checked by computing and applying the two possible transformations. This is, in fact, exactly the same as the O (m 3 n 3 min (m; n)) brute-force algorithm for protein docking mentioned above <ref> (Kuhl, Crippen, & Friesen 1984) </ref>! The second docking algorithm from that paper corresponds here to finding maximal interpretations, i.e. deepest leaves in the full interpretation tree. The degree of similarity in the work described in these two papers is striking.

Reference-contexts: Although clique-finding is known to be an NP-hard problem (Garey & Johnson 1979), the authors argue that their approach is efficient in practice due to the geometric nature of the constraints imposed by the distances. The DOCK algorithm described in <ref> (Kuntz et al. 1982) </ref> also tries to maximize the number of features matched, although it does not guarantee the global maximum. The algorithm is as follows: first, systematically pair each ligand sphere with each receptor sphere.

Reference-contexts: The goal is to determine whether the two can associate, and if so, to predict the geometric structure of their combined complex (Cher-fils & Janin 1993). A good solution to this problem would have important applications in the field of rational drug design <ref> (Kuntz 1992) </ref>, (Navia & Murcko 1992). Protein docking in full generality is a very complex problem, because each molecule may have many thousands of internal degrees of freedom.

Reference-contexts: For example, with a dihedral-angle parametrization of a chain molecule, a grid search simply varies systematically each dihedral angle by some fixed increment, and examines each conformation thereby obtained.

Reference-contexts: Recently, a much more efficient algorithm was presented in <ref> (Manocha & Canny 1992) </ref>. They start with a system of 14 equations presented in (Raghavan & Roth 1989), and simplify it through a series of symbolic precomputations. <p> On the contrary, the ability to compute closed-ring conformations for larger rings would be very useful.

Reference-contexts: However, this may not be such a bad thing. Folded proteins are very compact structures, with mainly hydrophilic side chains on the exterior and clusters of hydrophobic ones inside <ref> (McCammon & Harvey 1987) </ref>.

(Higher-frequency motions, such as bond stretching, should properly be simulated by quantum dynamics; this topic is beyond the scope of this paper.) An excellent introduction to both the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of molecular dynamics is <ref> (McCammon & Harvey 1987) </ref>. Because biological applications of dynamics simulations generally involve minimization of an energy function, potential functions are often used in deriving the force terms of the equations of motion. The most common type of potential function used in molecular dynamics studies is the "molecular mechanics" type.

Reference-contexts: A method for the general case is not developed, and the question of the number of possible solutions of the six equations is not addressed, except in noting that there may be multiple solutions.

Protein docking in full generality is a very complex problem, because each molecule may have many thousands of internal degrees of freedom.

Reference-contexts: It is also a natural candidate for application to matching problems in molecular biology, as first suggested in (Nussi-nov & Wolfson 1991). That paper describes a geometric hashing algorithm for detecting structural motifs in proteins. The same approach has also yielded interesting results for the docking problem <ref> (Norel et al. 1994) </ref>; a straightforward extension to the technique also solves a generalization of the docking problem, in which the ligand may have up to 3 internal rotational degrees of freedom, centered on a designated "hinge" atom of the ligand (Sandak, Nussinov, & Wolfson 1994). <p> Conclusions In this paper, we have discussed similarities between various problems in molecular biology and robotics. In two of these areas, namely geometric matching and dynamics simulation, interdisciplinary research efforts are already yielding promising results for structural biology <ref> (Norel et al. 1994) </ref>, (Jain, Vaidehi, & Rodriguez 1993). We have also discussed the highly analogous situation between the problems of molecular ring closure and the inverse kinematics of serial manipulators. The methods developed for the latter problem (Manocha & Canny 1992) may well find useful application to the former.

Reference-contexts: Yet under a certain reasonable "space-filling" assumption about the atoms, the number of immediate neighbors within any fixed radius of an atom is constant (with respect to the total number of atoms). Because of this, a data structure from computational geometry called the "fat" space partition <ref> (Overmars 1992) </ref> could potentially be employed to reduce the update time to linear.

Reference-contexts: A different constructive approach was reported in (Tsai & Morgan 1985).

Reference-contexts: This algorithm is based on a body of previous work by the same authors on the dynamics of robotic systems; see e.g. <ref> (Rodriguez, Jain, & Kreutz-Delgado 1992) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Solving this polynomial by numerical methods is not possible in practice, since its degree is around 64,000. Subsequently, a non-constructive proof of an upper bound of 32 on the number of possible solutions was given in <ref> (Roth, Rastegar, & Scheinman 1974) </ref>, and (Duffy & Crane 1980) gives a 32 nd degree polynomial in the tangent of one of the half-angles, which a numerical method could in principle use to solve for the joint angles. A different constructive approach was reported in (Tsai & Morgan 1985).

Reference-contexts: Protein docking in full generality is a very complex problem, because each molecule may have many thousands of internal degrees of freedom. To overcome this, researchers usually simplify the problem by treating the molecules as rigid bodies, thereby reducing the dimension of the search space to 6 <ref> (Shoichet & Kuntz 1991) </ref>. When X-ray crystallographic data is available, this approximation can be justified by comparing the experimental structures of bound complexes with those of their free components (Janin & Chothia 1990); most known associating proteins (but not all) are observed to behave as rigid bodies. <p> Our concern in this paper is the first problem, although the second is also far from solved; current theoretical models of energy evaluation are sufficiently inaccurate that they cannot in general distinguish between known complexes and geometrically reasonable "false positives" <ref> (Shoichet & Kuntz 1991) </ref>. Various different types of features have been used in the matching process. <p> The set of site points constitutes a negative image of the active regions of the receptor surface. Recently, (Lin et al. 1994) proposed a representation which supplements such point information with surface normals for better discrimination. In another approach ((Kuntz et al. 1982), <ref> (Shoichet & Kuntz 1991) </ref>), the features used are spheres. <p> Extensive tests on real data of these last two algorithms described have been reported in their respective papers ((Kuntz et al. 1982) and <ref> (Shoichet & Kuntz 1991) </ref> for DOCK, (Jiang & Kim 1991) for soft docking). For the purposes of evaluation, these tests were performed on pairs of molecules for which high-resolution X-ray crystallography data is available for the docked complexes, such as trypsin with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor.

Reference-contexts: For reasons of efficiency it is necessary to avoid computing terms for all of these. Since at large distances the nonbonded contributions to total energy asymptotically approach zero, it is customary to truncate beyond a certain distance. <ref> (Tasaki, McDonald, & Brady 1993) </ref> discusses ways to do this truncation gracefully, as well as the tradeoff between the cutoff distance and the accuracy of the simulation.

Reference-contexts: The matching problem for sequences (i.e. strings over an alphabet of 20 symbols) is quite straightforward and yields easily to dynamic programming methods (see <ref> (Taylor & Orengo 1989) </ref> and references therein). However, in a sense this solves the wrong problem, since there are examples of pairs of structurally similar proteins which have very different sequences.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the general 6R case was once dubbed the "Mount Everest" of inverse kinematic problems (Freudenstein 1973)! Although kinematic chains with 7 degrees of freedom have been considered <ref> (Waldron & Reidy 1986) </ref>, the complexity of controlling such robots makes them impractical, and hence higher-dimensional inverse kinematics has not received as much attention. In contrast, in molecular biology there is no such intrinsic reason to stop at 6 degrees of freedom.

Reference-contexts: The general technique of geometric hashing has found numerous applications in robotics, and often yields efficient and robust algorithms (see for example <ref> (Wallack, Canny, & Manocha 1993) </ref>). It is also a natural candidate for application to matching problems in molecular biology, as first suggested in (Nussi-nov & Wolfson 1991).

Reference-contexts: Subsequently a 16 th degree "input-output" polynomial was derived in (Raghavan & Roth 1989). Examples of general 6R manipulators and end-effector poses which have 16 distinct real solutions are known (Manseur & Doty 1989); in this sense, 16 is a tight upper bound. <ref> (Wampler & Morgan 1991) </ref> uses this bound to develop a polynomial continuation method which tracks exactly 16 paths which are guaranteed to converge to all 16 solutions; they report success on an extensive suite of test problems, with most running times around 6 to 8 seconds on an IBM 370 (the <p> This latter problem has been well studied, and efficient and numerically stable solutions are available (e.g. in the package LAPACK, described in (Anderson et al. 1992)). The running times reported on some of the same test cases used in <ref> (Wampler & Morgan 1991) </ref> are 11 milliseconds on average (the slowest was 25 milliseconds). In most cases, ordinary double floating-point arithmetic was sufficient to compute the answers to a very high degree of accuracy, making less efficient variable-precision arithmetic unnecessary.

Reference-contexts: Since classical sequence alignment methods need at least 25|30% sequence identity to detect homology, a recent trend is towards "sequence-structure" alignment ideas, in which a sequence and a structure are compared directly by using potential energy functions informed by a library of known protein structures; see <ref> (Wodak & Rooman 1993) </ref> for a review. Such approaches effectively restrict the search of conforma-tional space to certain subsets which contain known motifs; the challenge is to obtain subsets small enough to be tractably searched, and large enough to contain the right answer.
