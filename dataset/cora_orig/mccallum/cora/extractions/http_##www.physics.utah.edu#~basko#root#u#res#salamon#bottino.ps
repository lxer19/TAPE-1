Abstract: We analyze the data of low-energy cosmic-ray p spectrum, recently published by the BESS Collaboration, in terms of newly calculated fluxes for secondary antiprotons and for a possible contribution of an exotic signal due to neutralino annihilation in the galactic halo. We single out the relevant su-persymmetric configurations and discuss their explorability with experiments of direct search for particle dark matter and at accelerators. We discuss how future measurements with the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) on the Shuttle flight may disentangle the possible neutralino-induced contribution from the secondary one.

Reference-contexts: Solar modulation of the antiproton flux has been improved by analyzing the most complete set of data over the solar cycles [42] and the data on the proton spectrum of Refs. [19,20]. We have found that the most statistically relevant data on cosmic-ray antiprotons at low-energy <ref> [1] </ref> leave some room for a possible signal from neutralino annihilation in the galactic halo. We have discussed how the relevant supersymmetric configurations may be explored with direct experiments for particle dark matter search and at accelerators. <p> The experimental points are the BESS95 data <ref> [1] </ref>. The curves are the median (solid line), minimal (dotted line) and maximal (dashed line) secondary fluxes calculated in this paper, solar-modulated at the time of the BESS95 measurement. <p> Solid line is the IS spectrum; dashed (dotted) line is the solar-modulated spectrum at minima (maxima). Fig. 10 TOA antiproton fluxes versus the antiproton kinetic energy. The BESS95 data <ref> [1] </ref> are shown by crosses. The dashed line denotes the median secondary flux, the dotted one denotes the primary flux due to neutralino annihilation in the halo for a neutralino configuration with m = 62 GeV, P = 0:98 and h 2 = 0:11.

Reference: [13] <institution> A possible interpretation of BESS95 data in terms of neutralino annihilation is also suggested in Ref. </institution> <month> [1]. </month> <title> However the theoretical models used in that analysis (taken from Ref. [9]) differ from ours both for primary and secondary fluxes. In particular, the su-persymmetric model employed there is a minimal N =1 supergravity model, at variance with the one used in the present paper (MSSM at the electroweak scale). Furthermore, a large enhancement effect in the primary flux (induced by clumpiness in the halo) is introduced in that analysis. </title>

Reference: [45] <editor> Since the BESS95 data have asymmetric error bars, </editor> <title> we define a generalized 2 as: 2 = i ( th (T i ) exp i ) 2 i ) 2 ( th (T i ) exp i ) + exp i ) 2 i ) 2 ( exp i th (T i )) ; where + i ( i ) is the positive (negative) uncertainty in the i-th energy bin and is the Heaviside step function. In the case of symmetric uncertainties ( + i = i i ) this formula gives the standard definition of 2 </title> . 
Reference-contexts: This is indeed quantitatively confirmed by a 2 -evaluation, which shows that our median curve for secondaries fits the BESS95 data with a low reduced 2 value: ( 2 ) red = 0.83 (for 5 d.o.f.) <ref> [45] </ref>. However, it is interesting to explore which would be the chances for a signal, due to relic neutralino annihilations, of showing up in the low-energy window (T p &lt; ~ 1 GeV).

Reference-contexts: By combining all present experimental data <ref> [48] </ref>, we obtain the (90 % C.L.) upper bound displayed in Fig. 15 by the open solid curve (the total local dark matter density is normalized here and in the rest of this paper to the value l = 0:4 GeV cm 3 ). <p> It is most remarkable that a sizeable fraction of the configurations are accessible to investigation by direct detection, since the sensitivity in this kind of experiments is expected to be significantly improved in the near future <ref> [48] </ref>. The dashed line in Fig. 15 shows the discovery potential in case of an improvement by a factor of 10 in current sensitivities, what is within reach in a short time.

The scatter plot displays the values of ~ nucleon scalar for the configurations of set M (part (a) of Fig. 15) and of set N (part (b)). <p> This property would obviously be dramatically reinforced, should the indication about a possible annual modulation effect be confirmed by new data. In fact, it is very intriguing that many configurations of set M are indeed in the region singled out by the experiment of Ref. <ref> [50] </ref>. Finally, we notice that some configurations are actually excluded by the direct-search upper bound. This put emphasis on the potentiality of direct detection measurements in providing information on dark matter searches of different nature. <p> The open curve denotes the (90 % C.L.) upper bound obtained from experimental data of Ref.

Reference-contexts: SEARCH AT ACCELERATORS Let us turn now to the question of whether configurations of sets M and N might be explored at accelerators. LEP at s = 192 GeV may explore the configurations with a neutralino mass up to ' 50 GeV <ref> [52] </ref>. Then, from Fig. 12 we see that LEP will be able to investigate only marginally the configurations of set M and N in the gaugino sector. Experimental investigation of larger masses requires future upgrading of the Tevatron or LHC. <p> The representative points of the set cover almost completely the Higgs physical region. Part of these supersymmetric configurations (the ones on the left side of the solid curves) will be explored by LEP at p p s = 200 GeV, with a luminosity of 200 pb 1 per experiment <ref> [52] </ref>. IX. CONCLUSIONS We have presented a new analysis of the cosmic-ray antiprotons flux, expected on the basis of secondary p's, generated by interactions of cosmic-ray primaries with the interstellar medium, and of a possible exotic primary source of p's, originated by neutralino-neutralino annihilations in the Galactic halo. <p> The other lines display the LEP reach at luminosity L = 200 pb 1 and various energies <ref> [52] </ref>: (A) discovery potential at p s = 192 GeV; (B) discovery potential at p s = 200 GeV; (C) exclusion at p Fig. 18 Expected distribution of measurements with the AMS Shuttle flight according 21 to two different hypothesis: a) dominance of the secondary contribution (lower sequence of crosses), b)

Reference-contexts: Experimental investigation of larger masses requires future upgrading of the Tevatron or LHC. For instance, TeV33 could, under favorable hypothesis, explore a range up to m ' 125 GeV <ref> [53] </ref>. In this case, all the higgsino configurations can be explored, as well as a large portion of the gaugino sector.

Reference-contexts: The neutralino-induced p flux has been evaluated in a MSSM at the electroweak scale, which incorporates all current accelerator constraints. Use of supergravity-inspired unification conditions at large energy scale has been avoided in order not to arbitrarily constrain the neutralino phenomenology <ref> [54] </ref>. Solar modulation of the antiproton flux has been improved by analyzing the most complete set of data over the solar cycles [42] and the data on the proton spectrum of Refs. [19,20].
