Abstract: Tech. Report OSU-CISRC-1/96-TR04, Comp. & Info. Sci., Ohio State, 1996 1 Abstract This paper describes the spatial aggregation language and its applications. Spatial aggregation is a framework for organizing computations around image-like, analogue representations of physical processes in data interpretation and control tasks; it transforms a numerical input field to successively higher-level descriptions by applying a small, identical set of operators to each layer given a metric, neighborhood relation and equivalence relation. The spatial aggregation language provides two abstract data types (ADTs) | neighborhood graph and field | and a set of interface operators for constructing the transformations of the field. The language consists of a library of component implementations from which a user can mix-and-match and specialize for a particular application. The modular design of the ADTs supports language extensions and user control over tradeoffs such as efficiency vs. generality. We illustrate the use of the language with several examples ranging from region growing in image analysis to trajectory grouping in dynamics interpretation. Programs for these different task domains can be written in a modular, concise fashion in the spatial aggregation language. The language allows users to isolate and express important computational ideas while hiding low-level details.

Reference-contexts: Spatial aggregation transforms the input field to successively higher-level descriptions by applying a small, identical set of operators to each layer of the spatial aggregates. The spatial aggregation framework grows out of a class of problem solvers, KAM [14], MAPS [17] and HIPAIR <ref> [7] </ref>, that derive their power primarily from perceptual operators on analogue representations, and only secondarily from search and analytical methods.

HIPAIR is a program for this task <ref> [7] </ref>. A mechanism is often described in a configuration space where each dimension represents an independent degree of freedom. The configuration space consists of blocked space (impossible configurations) and free space (possible configurations).

Reference-contexts: It can also apply to a wide variety of other task domains such as image analysis and geographic information databases applications.

Mahoney <ref> [8] </ref> developed a library of elementary image analysis operations in the style of Ullman's visual routines. An interesting open problem is to re-implement the Ullman's set of visual routines in the spatial aggregation language. 4.4 Other applications Auditory scene analysis attempts to differentiate concurrent acoustic signals generated by distinct sources.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Effective reasoning about a physical system requires an appropriate mapping from the system characteristics to abstractions that match the requirements of the task at hand. Spatial aggregation organizes computations around image-like, analogue representations of physical processes in data interpretation and control tasks <ref> [16] </ref>. In Qualitative Physics, three ontological abstractions are widely used: device, process, and constraint.

Reference-contexts: We use a region-growing example from image analysis to illustrate the basic components of the language and how a simple program can be written for the task. A region is an area in an image whose pixels share a common property <ref> [18] </ref>. The program takes as input a field | an image mapping pixel coordinates to brightness values | and produces a list of disjoint regions of pixels with similar brightness values. For 2 For example, we might define a Euclidean or Manhattan metric on a set of points.
