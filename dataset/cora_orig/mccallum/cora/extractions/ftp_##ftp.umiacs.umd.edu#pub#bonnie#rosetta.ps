Abstract: This book describes the theoretical underpinnings and results of Rosetta, a machine translation (MT) project that started at Philips Research Laboratory in the early 1980's; the book focuses on research carried out between 1985 and 1992. While the project was a collective enterprise among a large number of people (as the pen name indicates), the principal authors were Lisette Appelo, Theo Janssen, Franciska de Jong, and Jan Lands-bergen. The book provides a coherent distillation of dozens of publications; in particular, the work described therein has served as the basis of at least two doctoral dissertations (Janssen 1986; Appelo 1993), as well as numerous technical reports, conference papers, and journal articles. In addition to providing a novel framework for examining issues in MT, the book covers several topics that are tied together within a compositional, inter-lingual approach based on Montague grammar. Thus, it serves as a valuable resource for researchers in MT and computational linguistics; with some work it could also serve as a course textbook. 1 The main thesis of the book is that MT can be a good carrier for linguistic and computational research; thus, the emphasis is on modeling linguistic knowledge involved in the translation of natural languages (English, Dutch, and Spanish). The two main principles threaded throughout the book are:

Reference-contexts: A wide range of translation problems, and their corresponding solutions, are discussed in great detail. Chapters 12 and 13 present an approach to the divergence problem that is contrasted with that of a number of MT researchers, in particular, work on categorial, promotional, and demotional divergences <ref> (Dorr 1993) </ref>, structural mismatches (Estival, Ballim, Russell, and Warwick 1990), category changes and head switching (Lindop and Tsujii 1991; Kaplan and Wedekind 1993), embedding differences (Sadler and Thompson 1991; Kaplan, Netter, Wedekind, and Zaenen 1989), and complex lexical mismatches (Thurmair 1990). <p> It would make a great deal of sense to encode such information in the lexicon (i.e., associate a lexical marker with the word itself as in <ref> (Dorr 1993) </ref>). With such an encoding, it would not be the case that every Dutch adverbial (e.g., gisteren or `yesterday') triggers a grammar interrupt; only certain adverbials would act as triggers, namely those associated with a lexical marker (e.g., toevallig ). <p> However, choosing an interlingua is undeniably a slippery endeavor (see, e.g., <ref> (Dorr and Voss 1993) </ref>) and so I am more than willing to leave this issue aside for the purposes of this review. 5 See (Dorr 1993) for linguistic justification of this representation. 6 On page 249, the authors mention that the label "categorial divergence" covers both the promotional and demotional cases <p> However, choosing an interlingua is undeniably a slippery endeavor (see, e.g., (Dorr and Voss 1993)) and so I am more than willing to leave this issue aside for the purposes of this review. 5 See <ref> (Dorr 1993) </ref> for linguistic justification of this representation. 6 On page 249, the authors mention that the label "categorial divergence" covers both the promotional and demotional cases in (Dorr 1993); no explanation is given for this move, but I would suspect it is because of this rigidity. 5 Computational Linguistics Volume <p> Voss 1993)) and so I am more than willing to leave this issue aside for the purposes of this review. 5 See <ref> (Dorr 1993) </ref> for linguistic justification of this representation. 6 On page 249, the authors mention that the label "categorial divergence" covers both the promotional and demotional cases in (Dorr 1993); no explanation is given for this move, but I would suspect it is because of this rigidity. 5 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 4 means that the two would never be translation equivalents.

Reference-contexts: The omission of these details makes it difficult to evaluate the system, especially since so many of Rosetta's characteristics (e.g., the isomorphism requirement) depart radically from those of fully running and well-tested systems (e.g., the LOGOS system <ref> (Gdaniec 1994) </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Thus, the same effect could be achieved by a simple transfer mapping between analogous meaning-preserving rules in the SL and TL. Indeed, this point has been brought up previously <ref> (Hutchins and Somers 1992, page 294) </ref>, where the primary criticism is that the SL and TL grammars are so tightly attuned that the approach might even be considered direct MT.

Reference-contexts: designers (myself included) are forced to select a canonical form that parallels one language or the other in the case of head-swapping phenomena. 4 In 4 My preference would be to argue for the choice of interlingua on linguistic grounds (e.g., tests that predict lexical-semantic behavior such as those in <ref> (Levin 1993) </ref>, especially in a project like Rosetta, 4 the example above, the representation that is chosen corresponds logically to the canon-ical form `by-chance (Mary,come).' Thus, the English syntactic structure parallels the canonical form: the verb construct corresponding to `by-chance' (happen to) takes as its argument the clause corresponding to `(Mary,come)'
