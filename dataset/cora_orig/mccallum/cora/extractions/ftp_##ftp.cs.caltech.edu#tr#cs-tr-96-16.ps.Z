Abstract: This paper presents a series of tests that have been conducted to validate the collision models of the HawkDSMC implementation. These tests cover the hard sphere (HS), variable hard sphere (VHS), and variable soft sphere (VSS) collision models, and the Larsen-Borgnakke energy exchange model, for non-reacting gas mixtures. The results show that Hawkobtains the correct results in all cases under consideration.

Reference-contexts: The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method (See, for example, <ref> [Bird94] </ref>.) is a widely used numerical approach for solving rarefied gas dynamics problems in the transitional regime. It simulates individual particles as they move through space and collide with solid objects and other particles.

Reference-contexts: Results for Hawkand SMILE are shown in Figures 13 and 14. 20 7 The Larsen-Borgnakke Energy Exchange Model The Larsen-Borgnakke model of energy exchange is used to describe internal energy modes for rotation and vibration <ref> [Borgnakke75] </ref>. Relative translational and internal post-collision energies of colliding particles are assumed to be distributed according to equilibrium distribution function.

Reference-contexts: For the purposes of validation, it has been useful to compare the results obtained with Hawkto those obtained with another DSMC implementation, SMILE. SMILE is a Computational tool for solving problems of rarefied gas aerodynamics <ref> [Ivanov92] </ref>, created at the Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (Novosibirsk, Russia). It is based on the majorant principle of construction and substantiation of numerical schemes for the DSMC method.

Reference-contexts: It is based on the majorant principle of construction and substantiation of numerical schemes for the DSMC method. The coupling of cell and free cell schemes <ref> [Ivanov94] </ref> provides the required spatial resolution throughout the whole flow field, including regions with strong gradients. The preprocessing subsystem of this tool is used for defining the geometric model of a space vehicle and for specifying boundary and initial conditions.

Reference-contexts: The two main components of any DSMC implementation are therefore the transport and collision algorithms. Particle transport is conceptually straightforward, and is discussed in detail in <ref> [Rieffel95] </ref>. Both the power and computational cost of the DSMC method are due to the collision process, and are therefore the subject of this paper. <p> The main goal of this work is to validate the collision models that have been implemented in Hawk, a DSMC application designed for the simulation of plasma reactors. General characteristics of Hawk, including methods for computing macroscopic parameters, grid issues, and the parallel implementation, are discussed in <ref> [Rieffel95] </ref>. The main purpose of this paper is to present the collision models that are implemented in Hawk, and to demonstrate their validation. For the purposes of validation, it has been useful to compare the results obtained with Hawkto those obtained with another DSMC implementation, SMILE. <p> IPL model is equivalent to the hard sphere model for, T = d 2 ; b = d cos (=2); where d is the molecular diameter. 8 4 The Hard Sphere Collision Model Earlier versions of this implementation have been validated by comparison with published results [Zhong95] for heat-transfer problems <ref> [Rieffel95] </ref>.
