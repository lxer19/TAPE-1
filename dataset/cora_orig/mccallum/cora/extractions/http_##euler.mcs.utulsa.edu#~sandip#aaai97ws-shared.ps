Abstract: Evolving Cooperative Groups: Preliminary Results Abstract Multi-agent systems require coordination of sources with distinct expertise to perform complex tasks effectively. In this paper, we use co-evolutionary approach using genetic algorithms to evolve multiple individuals who can effectively cooperate to solve a common problem. We concurrently run a GA for each individual in the group. In this paper, we experiment with a room painting domain which requires cooperation of two agents. We have used two mechanisms for evaluating an individual in one population: (a) pair it randomly with members from the other population, (b) pair it with members of the other population in a shared memory containing the best pairs found so far. Both the approaches are successful in generating optimal behavior patterns. However, our preliminary results exhibit a slight edge for the shared memory approach.

Reference-contexts: Later we use a shared memory to store the n best couples found so far. Simultaneous evolution approachs have been successfully used in competitive environments. In Rosin [3] it was successfully applied in developing efficient strategies for simple two players games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Nim and Go.

For cooperative agents environment SAMUEL successfully develops strategies using evaluation of individuals from one of the populations against random members of the set of previous champions from another population. <p> Another approach to evaluating individuals would be to pair it with one or more good individuals from the other population. Others have suggested using a random collection of the best individual from the other population over all generations for this purpose <ref> [1] </ref>. A variation of this approach would be to select a collection of best partners from the other generation. <p> This can be achieved with shared memory approach to the problem. In a competitive setting, the evaluation of an individual should be some kind of average over its evaluation when pitted against each of the members from the other population <ref> [1, 3] </ref>, as we want to evolve individuals that are robust. In the cooperative setting we assigned the highest evaluation from all pairings with an individual to be the evaluation of that individual. This is because we are interested in finding a pair who performs the best.
