Abstract: In this paper, a form of decision-feedback sequence estimation (DFSE) is proposed for unwhitened inter-symbol interference (ISI) channels. DFSE which is a reduced-complexity alternative to maximum likelihood sequence estimation, performs very well on whitened (minimum-phase) ISI channels. However, it may not be feasible to compute the whitening filter for many time-varying channels like the multiuser asynchronous direct-sequence CDMA channel. On such channels, it is desirable to use the Ungerboeck formulation which operates directly on discrete-time unwhitened statistic obtained from conventional matched filtering. Unfortunately, decision-feedback sequence estimation for unwhitened channels is interference limited because the decision statistic depends on both past and future inputs. Specifically, the decision rule that chooses the path with the best accumulated metric leading to a reduced state, fails to account for interference from the future inputs not included in the reduced state. We propose a modified decision rule to be integrated into the Ungerboeck form of sequence estimation which is not sensitive to channel phase. It can be implemented as a single stage or a multistage scheme depending on the amount of dispersion present in the channel. Simulation results indicate that the algorithm used on unwhitened channels with low to moderate dispersion, provides similar performance/complexity tradeoffs as the DFSE used on the corresponding whitened minimum-phase channels. The algorithm is especially attractive for multiuser asynchronous DS-CDMA channels with long spreading codes.

Reference-contexts: An example is the multiuser asynchronous direct-sequence CDMA channel where the spreading of users' transmit pulses with long non-orthogonal spreading codes gives rise to rapidly time-varying ISI over the composite data sequence. Clearly, Ungerboeck's form is better suited for such channels as noise whitening is expensive <ref> [5] </ref>. However, a reduced-state Ungerboeck variant (which we call UDFSE 2 ) similar to the DFSE does not work as well. The problem arises from the nature of the unwhitened statistic which depends on both past and future input symbols.

Reference-contexts: As a result, the decisions obtained in UDFSE are interference-limited even in the absence of feedback errors. The M-algorithm <ref> [7] </ref>, used on unwhitened statistic, suffers from the same problem as paths are selected based on accumulated metrics which do not reflect all relevant interference components. In the case of UDFSE, where the reduced state is pre-determined, the interfering anti-causal components are known.
