Abstract: The SARTOR project has as one of its goals the development of an environment for the development of correct real-time systems. Modechart is a specification language for real-time systems developed as part of this project. Verify4 is an implementation of a verifier for certain classes of properties of systems specified using modechart. This paper describes the program verify4 and addresses implementation issues surrounding three of the key algorithms used in the program.
