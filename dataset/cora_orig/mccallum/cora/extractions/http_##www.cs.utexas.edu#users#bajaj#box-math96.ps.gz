Abstract: Interrogative visualization refers to the process of interactive computer graphics display and accurate quantitative querying of physical data. Quantitative querying includes search for metric, combinatorial and topological information. To support this paradigm, we build uniform, compact, co-registered representations (spline models) of multiple physical data fields over the same domain. Dense, unstructured volumetric scalar fields are approximated by C 1 -continuous trivariate polynomial spline functions of low degree. Additionally, these spline functions are also used to model scattered scalar fields sampled over a manifold surface in the volume. Using both implicit polynomial spline surfaces and trivariate polynomial spline functions allows for model representations of both manifold and associated scalar fields over the same spatial decomposition. Quantitative querying is made efficient by utilizing various search structures over the modeled field data.

Reference-contexts: One common approach to the modeling of scattered data in any dimension is based on triangulating the data points, simplifying the triangulation to reduce the size of the model, and then constructing a suitable interpolant on each triangle (or higher-dimensional simplex) of the reduced model, additionally approximating the original data <ref> [1, 29, 30] </ref>. The initial triangulation and post simplification can become quite expensive. <p> All proofs of the lemmas and theorems can be found in [2]. 2 Modeling of volumetric data There is a large body of literature on modeling of volumetric data. Reviews of prior work in the field can be found in <ref> [1, 5, 21, 30, 31] </ref>. We first describe how to use tensor-product polynomial splines to model dense, scattered volumetric data. For the sake of simplicity, we describe our method for the reconstruction of a single, scalar field. <p> The problem of interpolating or approximating data defined over a given manifold in R 3 is commonly referred to as modeling 3D scattered manifold data or the function-on-surface problem [30].

Reference-contexts: Here, I provide a brief review of some piecewise polynomial approximation algorithms used for the construction of spline models of both scattered volumetric and manifold <ref> [2, 3, 7] </ref>. I give some details of tensor-product Bernstein-Bezier (BB) polynomial constructions used both as implicit surface splines, as well as trivariate polynomial function splines, and defined over a single spatial octree decomposition [2]. Tensor-product B-splines or Box-splines could also be used [16]. <p> I give some details of tensor-product Bernstein-Bezier (BB) polynomial constructions used both as implicit surface splines, as well as trivariate polynomial function splines, and defined over a single spatial octree decomposition <ref> [2] </ref>. Tensor-product B-splines or Box-splines could also be used [16]. Scattered data, as opposed to data associated with the nodes of a regular grid, pose challenging visualization problems. Standard techniques for direct volume visualization, isosurface extraction etc. rely on the existence of a grid of known topology [37]. <p> Additionally, I review the modeling of manifolds and associated scalar field data using both implicit tensor product BB polynomial spline surfaces and trivariate tensor product BB polynomial spline functions over the same spatial octree decomposition <ref> [2] </ref>. The main goals achieved by such an adaptive modeling technique are: (i) compact adaptive representation of domains and associated physical fields and (ii) easy visualization, and interactive querying of physical fields. <p> Details on the mathematics involved are given in Section 4. Several examples and results are shown and discussed in Section 5. All proofs of the lemmas and theorems can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. 2 Modeling of volumetric data There is a large body of literature on modeling of volumetric data. Reviews of prior work in the field can be found in [1, 5, 21, 30, 31]. We first describe how to use tensor-product polynomial splines to model dense, scattered volumetric data. <p> This Section shows a way of constructing tri-cubic and tri-quadratic interpolants over a box, given the above derivative jet at all its eight vertices, so that the composite function is C 1 continuous. All proofs of the lemmas and theorems stated in this Section can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. The following Lemma tells us how to compute the coefficients around a vertex from the derivative jet there.

Such trivariate polynomial spline approximation schemes for scattered volumetric and manifold scalar field data, built over 3D incremental Delaunay triangulations are reported in <ref> [7, 3] </ref>. Here I report on a similar scheme for volumetric data using tensor-product BB polynomial splines over octree decompositions of a cuboid enclosing the data. <p> Several papers focus on building a piecewise-linear surface [12, 13, 18, 25, 36]. Other methods use parametric or functional surface patches for either local or global interpolation [9, 22, 24, 27, 32, 34]. A few papers (see <ref> [3, 14, 15, 23, 28, 35] </ref>) use implicit surface patches. In this paper, we use an implicitly defined tensor-product polynomial spline surface to approximate the unknown surface M. <p> Then ffi (q) = 0 will recover the surface M. When only discrete data on a surface is available, an approximate signed-distance can be defined in some appropriate way (see e.g. <ref> [3, 25, 28] </ref>). Given the signed-distance function, one can approximate it with a piecewise polynomial function S (x; y; z) (in a suitable domain containing P ), and then extract the zero-contour of S. <p> While this approach gives very convincing results, and allows for smooth objects with sharp features to be correctly reconstructed, the computational time required by the optimization and smoothing steps can be significant. Bajaj et al. <ref> [3] </ref> propose the use of ff-shapes [17] to build a piecewise-linear approximation of the surface being reconstructed. The ff-shape is a sub-complex of the Delaunay triangulation of the set of points P .

Reference-contexts: Different from the volumetric data modeling case, an important issue here is guaranteeing that the resulting patches are smooth and single-sheeted. For this, a theorem similar to Theorems 3.2 and 3.3 in <ref> [4] </ref> for a tetrahedron can be established for a tensor-product scheme: Theorem 3.1 Let P ijk = P "D ijk .

Availability of a compact model for multiple, co-registered scalar and vector fields (and for the geometry of the manifold) allows accurate quantitative queries of combinatorial, metric and topological properties of the fields. The C 1 spline model additionally supports computation of smooth navigation paths in the field data.

Since S is a piecewise C 1 continuous surface and each piece is C 1 , hence fl &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: In- cremental regular decompositions, such as octrees, provide a natural search structure as well as a hierarchy of approximating spline models. Hierarchical spline representations provide interrogative visualization at multiple approximation levels [20]. Seed cell pre-computations coupled with interval search trees provide fast multiple query times, such as for isocontouring <ref> [8] </ref>. Isocontouring and local normal projection methods with color plots can be used to display fields over a manifold.

When only discrete data on a surface is available, an approximate signed-distance can be defined in some appropriate way (see e.g. <ref> [3, 25, 28] </ref>). Given the signed-distance function, one can approximate it with a piecewise polynomial function S (x; y; z) (in a suitable domain containing P ), and then extract the zero-contour of S. <p> This sign is associated to the distance values computed for each vertex. This dense-sampling assumption can be too restrictive in some practical cases. Hoppe et al. <ref> [25] </ref> use a more global approach to correctly orient the approximated manifold. First, for each data point p i , they compute a best fit plane, and the associated normal ^n i , based on best-fit of k neighbor points (the k-neighborhood of p i ). <p> In our implementation we have used both the normal propagation approach <ref> [25] </ref> and the weighted ff-shapes [17]. We then use the adaptive algorithm described in Section 2 to approximate the signed-distance function, whose value is known at data points (where it is obviously zero) and can be computed (approximately) at any other point.

Reference-contexts: An algorithm similar to marching cubes is then used to construct a piecewise-linear approximation of the zero contour of ffi. In two subsequent steps, described in <ref> [24, 26] </ref>, the constructed mesh is optimized (i.e., the number of triangles is reduced while the distance of the mesh from the data points is kept small) and then a smooth surface is built on it.

Reference-contexts: Several papers focus on building a piecewise-linear surface [12, 13, 18, 25, 36]. Other methods use parametric or functional surface patches for either local or global interpolation <ref> [9, 22, 24, 27, 32, 34] </ref>. A few papers (see [3, 14, 15, 23, 28, 35]) use implicit surface patches. In this paper, we use an implicitly defined tensor-product polynomial spline surface to approximate the unknown surface M.

In this paper, we use an implicitly defined tensor-product polynomial spline surface to approximate the unknown surface M. <p> Then ffi (q) = 0 will recover the surface M. When only discrete data on a surface is available, an approximate signed-distance can be defined in some appropriate way (see e.g. <ref> [3, 25, 28] </ref>). Given the signed-distance function, one can approximate it with a piecewise polynomial function S (x; y; z) (in a suitable domain containing P ), and then extract the zero-contour of S. <p> Using the signed-distance function to reconstruct a surface from scattered data points has been considered by several authors. Moore and Warren <ref> [28] </ref> use a tetrahedral decomposition of the space, and reconstruct the surface by implicit barycentric Bernstein-Bezier patches. For each tetrahedron, they compute the associated surface patch by least-squares fitting of the data points and samples of a "local" signed-distance function.

Reference-contexts: One common approach to the modeling of scattered data in any dimension is based on triangulating the data points, simplifying the triangulation to reduce the size of the model, and then constructing a suitable interpolant on each triangle (or higher-dimensional simplex) of the reduced model, additionally approximating the original data <ref> [1, 29, 30] </ref>. The initial triangulation and post simplification can become quite expensive.

Reference-contexts: If e &gt; * then subdivide D ijk into eight sub-boxes. Mark the sub-boxes and their vertices as new. Then return to step 2. End Algorithm Notice that the adaptive refinement of the subdivision can be represented as an octree search structure (see e.g. <ref> [33] </ref>). In the following we refer to the level of a box with the following meaning: boxes at level 1 are those belonging to the coarser subdivision. Boxes at level i + 1 have been obtained subdividing a box at a level i into eight sub-boxes.

Reference-contexts: Tensor-product B-splines or Box-splines could also be used [16]. Scattered data, as opposed to data associated with the nodes of a regular grid, pose challenging visualization problems. Standard techniques for direct volume visualization, isosurface extraction etc. rely on the existence of a grid of known topology <ref> [37] </ref>.
