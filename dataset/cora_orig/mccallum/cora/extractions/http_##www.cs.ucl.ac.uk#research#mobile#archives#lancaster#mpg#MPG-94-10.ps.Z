Reference-contexts: The data rates of commercially available wireless LAN systems vary from 2Mbps (NCR's WaveLAN [Tuch,91]) to 15Mbps (Motorola's Altair <ref> [Buchholz,91] </ref>, [Freeburg,91]). The power consumption and amount of space used by these LANs makes them, at moment, unsuitable to fit into a portable computer. 2.3.3 Wide Area Radio Wide area radio at present is almost entirely conducted via cellular radio.

The MINT project <ref> [Hager,93] </ref> is aiming for an infrared directional link, over 5m, of 10Mbps, though 1-10Mbps is more typical. 2.3.2 Local Area Radio Local area radio is intended to connect computers in a limited environment, ie across an office or a factory.

Reference-contexts: These gigabit and terabit networks, such as the Stockholm Gigabit Network (SGN) <ref> [Karlsson,92] </ref>, offer the potential of diverse multi-service multimedia applications, but the issues and problems concerning lower speed networks are still relevant and must not be ignored. 2.2 MidRange Networks The networks, now classed as medium speed, are probably the most common and widely available.

Reference-contexts: Whilst considering the QoS delivered to the users it is worth investigating the users will to pay for what they receive, particularly in a consumer service environment. <ref> [Parris,92] </ref> conducts a study of pricing policies on integrated networks. For example, a user in a business conference may settle for grey scale if he is only looking at someone's head and it would cost him three times as much to see the colour of the persons eyes.

Reference-contexts: A method that has been proposed for controlling QoS at various layers is Filtering <ref> [Pasquale,92] </ref>. Although they can be applied to point-to-point connections, filters offer greatest benefits over traditional error and flow control mechanisms when applied to multicast transmission protocols. <p> Unreliable multicasts involve a more relaxed view to error and flow control. There is still a notion of group membership, but error control can be implemented using forward error correction, redundancy and coding to enable error localisation and concealment <ref> [Pasquale,92] </ref>. Flow control can be performed in a number of ways such as receiver initiated resource reservation [Zhang,93], network admission control and the filtering of streams at congested key points. Very little provision appears to be made for event ordering in such a system. <p> The source does not care whether a sink receives the data correctly or whether it receives it at all as it does not know who it is sending to. It is entirely up to to the receiver whether to receive the stream or ignore it. <ref> [Pasquale,92] </ref> makes the analogy with users tuning into to a channel on a cable TV broadcast. His dissemination approach to multicasting is basically a receiver oriented broadcast.

Reference-contexts: Some of the advantages in the use of filters can also be considered as disadvantages. <ref> [Pasquale,93] </ref> details that there is a trade off between bandwidth and processing performed in a network. In the previous examples the passing on of compression/decompression to the switches will inevitably slow the switches down possibly causing congestion at the switches.

Survey of Networking Technologies In order to understand the problems entailed in the transfer of multimedia data across a heterogeneous networking environment, it could be useful to survey a number of various networks <ref> [Steenmeijer,90] </ref>. Not only do the networks involved vary greatly but also the end systems, sources and sinks.

Reference-contexts: Again, comparing the two extremes of picture quality we have 49,152x5 which gives 245,760 bits/sec (approx. 30Kbytes/sec) and 9,437,184x25 equalling 235,929,600 bits/sec (approx 30Mbytes/sec). Compression factor - These figures for bandwidth requirements are not the absolute end; modern compression/decompression schemes (JPEG <ref> [Wallace,91] </ref>, MPEG [Le Gall,91] and Intel's DVI) can perform compressions of 1% of the original, unfortunately the higher compression factors require considerable number crunching and cannot be performed in real-time. Although decompression from DVI can be done in real-time by a 386/486 processor with minimal hardware support.

Reference-contexts: Supporting Quality of Service in multimedia communications via the use of filters 15 A network of non-propagating filters is also possible; the Experimental Infrastructure at Lancaster University, see Fig 5., proposes the use of a filter server based around a Multimedia Enhancement Network Device (MEND) <ref> [Yeadon,93] </ref>. The server and surrounding heterogeneous networks will provide a platform to test the use of filters, and resolve the question of whether to propagate or not. Also the experimental MEND network will implement device level filter processing.

Reference-contexts: The main two are Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) and Token Ring. Audio voice transfer across such networks has been possible for a time now <ref> [Zellweg,88] </ref>, recent advances in compression technology has allowed networks originally only intended for data transfer to be used for higher quality audio and video transfer. 2.2.1 Ethernet Ethernet is the best known implementation of CSMA/CD. It is standardised by the IEEE 802.3.
