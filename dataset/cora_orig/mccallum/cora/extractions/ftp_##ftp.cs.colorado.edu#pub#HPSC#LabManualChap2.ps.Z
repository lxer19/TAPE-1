Abstract: A large amount of data is produced with high performance scientific computing. The term, visualization for scientific computing, shortened to scientific visualization, was coined in 1986 and refers to the science or methodology of quickly and effectively displaying scientific data. The goal of scientific visualization is to enhance scientific productivity by utilizing human visual perception and computer graphics techniques. Hence computer graphics has become an important part of scientific computing. A large number of software packages now exist to aid the scientist in developing graphical representations of his data. These packages include MATLAB by MathWorks, Inc., IDL by Research Systems, Inc., and AVS by Advanced Visual Systems, Inc. This chapter serves as an introduction to some of these ideas; it is not meant to be a complete coverage of the subject. The examples and exercises are designed to acquaint you with some of the techniques and the problems involved in computer graphics. The current version of MATLAB is able to handle colors and shadings and images and is used in these exercises. You
