Title: On Contention Resolution Protocols and Associated Probabilistic Phenomena

Abstract: Consider an on-line scheduling problem in which a set of abstract processes are competing for the use of a number of resources. Further assume that it is either prohibitively expensive or impossible for any two of the processes to directly communicate with one another. If several processes simultaneously attempt to allocate a particular resource (as may be expected to occur, since the processes cannot easily coordinate their allocations), then none succeed. In such a framework, it is a challenge to design efficient contention resolution protocols. Two recently-proposed approaches to the problem of PRAM emulation give rise to scheduling problems of the above kind. In one approach, the resources (in this case, the shared memory cells) are duplicated and distributed randomly. We analyze a simple and efficient deterministic algorithm for accessing some subset of the duplicated resources. In the other approach, we analyze how quickly we can access the given (nonduplicated) resource using a simple randomized strategy. We obtain precise bounds on the performance of both strategies. We anticipate that our results will find other applications.

Reference-contexts: Valiant's S*PRAM model [24] corresponds to the 1-arbitrary crossbar model. Assuming a complete interconnection between processors and memory modules, the c-collision (resp., c-arbitrary) DMM models of <ref> [9] </ref> corresponds to the c-collision (resp., c-arbitrary) crossbar model. We now return to the question of efficiently emulating an EREW PRAM on a c-collision crossbar. More specifically, assume that we wish to emulate a k-processor EREW PRAM on an n-processor c-collision crossbar, where k is some multiple of n. <p> If k = n and c = O (1), we can conclude that any scheme based on a single hash function requires (lg n= lg lg n) time to emulate one step of the EREW PRAM. On the other hand, Dietzfelbinger and Meyer auf der Heide <ref> [9] </ref> have recently shown that a bound of O (lg lg n) time per EREW PRAM step is attainable for the same settings of k and c. <p> An overview of our results in this area is given in Section 1.2. 1.1 Redundancy-Based Protocols In this section we give a brief overview of our emulation results related to protocols employing multiple hash functions. As mentioned earlier, Dietzfelbinger and Meyer auf der Heide <ref> [9] </ref> have presented a protocol using three hash functions that emulates an n-processor EREW PRAM in O (lg lg n) time on an n-processor c-collision crossbar. <p> crossbar access 2 out of the 3 copies corresponding to memory location x. (A similar protocol was presented in [17]; the idea that accessing 2 out of 3 copies is sufficient for the purposes of such an emulation was first used by Upfal and Wigderson [23].) The analysis presented in <ref> [9] </ref> requires some slack in the constants; in particular, they require c 3, and are only able to analyze the protocol when it is used to emulate "n processors at a time, where " is a sufficiently small positive constant. (Thus, the overall running time of the protocol is increased by <p> particular, they require c 3, and are only able to analyze the protocol when it is used to emulate "n processors at a time, where " is a sufficiently small positive constant. (Thus, the overall running time of the protocol is increased by a factor of 1=".) The protocol of <ref> [9] </ref> is easily generalized to the case where b hash functions are used, and each processor of the c-collision crossbar is required to access a out of b copies of a particular memory location, a &lt; b. <p> Interestingly, this is not the case; rather, as discussed in Section 2.5, our reduction yields a faster "a out of b" protocol than is obtained via the natural generalization of <ref> [9] </ref> for virtually all possible values of a and b. The main idea underlying the aforementioned results may be explained as follows. <p> In <ref> [9, 21] </ref>, this problem is attacked by studying certain structures related to the sequence of distributions. <p> simple sequence of ` rounds can be repeated until each processor has had one successful access: In the jth round, if processor i has not successfully accessed any copy of x i , then processor i accesses h j (x i ). (This is analogous to Access Schedule 2 of <ref> [9] </ref>, defined for the 2 out of 3 problem.) On a c-collision crossbar, processor j succeeds on its access if and only if there are at most c 1 other processors accessing the same memory module. Each round is executed in a synchronous fashion. <p> In the following discussion, we refer to this protocol as the generic protocol. For given a and b, the analysis of the generic protocol can be done using the approach of Subsection 2.3, but involves more complicated calculations and recurrences. In <ref> [9] </ref>, the authors use a different analysis of this protocol for the 2 out of 3 case and show an O (log log n) upper bound when the collision factor is greater than 3.

Valiant's S*PRAM model [24] corresponds to the 1-arbitrary crossbar model. Assuming a complete interconnection between processors and memory modules, the c-collision (resp., c-arbitrary) DMM models of [9] corresponds to the c-collision (resp., c-arbitrary) crossbar model. <p> We are particularly interested in a natural randomized h-relation routing algorithm proposed by Gereb-Graus and Tsantilas <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> The resulting running time is fi (h + lg n lg h). (Remark: the running time is stated as fi (h + lg n lg lg n) in <ref> [10] </ref>, since they only considered the case h log n.) Thus, the algorithm leads to a work-optimal EREW PRAM emulation only for h = (lg n lg lg n). <p> Our lower bound relies on a combinatorial argument for extracting "thick" hypergraphs and another combinatorial argument showing the existence of contention-generating "near transversals". Much faster protocols can be obtained for the Control Tower problem using randomization. For instance, the randomized protocol in Gereb-Graus and Tsantilas <ref> [10] </ref> solves the Control Tower problem in O (h + log h log n) steps, wvhp. <p> Direct algorithms have the advantage of simplicity and low overhead. While non-direct algorithms may have better asymptotic behavior, it is likely that this improved asymptotic behavior is only achieved at the expense of large constant factors. The previously mentioned h-relation routing algorithm of Gereb-Graus and Tsantilas <ref> [10] </ref> is a direct algorithm, and direct h-relation routing algorithms have also been studied in [11, 12]. <p> If the number of messages left to transmit were known to all stations at every step, then the Control Tower problem could be solved in fi (h + log n) steps wvhp. If not, Gereb-Graus and Tsantilas <ref> [10] </ref> showed that the Control Tower problem could be solved in O (h + log h log n) time wvhp, but it was not known whether the extra log h factor could be eliminated. <p> The randomized lower bound for the Control Tower and the h-relation routing problems in Section 3 matches the upper bound of <ref> [10] </ref> up to a constant factor. In the deterministic case, however, there is factor of minflog h; log log ng (resp., minflog h; log log ng log h) separating the best known upper and lower bounds for the Control Tower problem (resp., h-relation routing problem).

To achieve success wvhp requires fi (log n) steps, however. Still, this turns out to be the best strategy possible, as shown by Goldberg, Jerrum, Leighton, and Rao <ref> [12] </ref>. Generalizing to h &gt; 2, we can easily verify that if there are k messages left to transmit (k h), then by having each station transmit with probability 1=k, we maximize the probability of obtaining a successful transmission. <p> Then by Lemma 3.2, we can find a group of p n vertices which cover exactly the same set of edges. Then we simply select h vertices from this group. (This case is also shown in Goldberg, Jerrum, Leighton, Rao <ref> [12] </ref>.)

Reference-contexts: uniformly at random from F k m;n , then Pr [h (x i ) = y i for 0 i &lt; j] = 1=n j : p m;n can be constructed as in [17] using the families H n d ;n and H 1 m;n d defined in [6] and <ref> [22] </ref> respectively. (Here d is an appropriate constant.) A hash function h chosen uniformly at random from 22 F k m;n is defined as r ffi s, where r and s are chosen uniformly at random from H n d ;n and H 1 m;n d respectively. <p> Both r and s can be evaluated in constant time <ref> [22, 6] </ref>, and hence so can be h. In order to analyze the 1 out of ` protocol, we restrict our attention to the at most n memory requests of the processors.

Reference-contexts: processor i of the c-collision crossbar access 2 out of the 3 copies corresponding to memory location x. (A similar protocol was presented in [17]; the idea that accessing 2 out of 3 copies is sufficient for the purposes of such an emulation was first used by Upfal and Wigderson <ref> [23] </ref>.) The analysis presented in [9] requires some slack in the constants; in particular, they require c 3, and are only able to analyze the protocol when it is used to emulate "n processors at a time, where " is a sufficiently small positive constant. (Thus, the overall running time of

Reference-contexts: Valiant's S*PRAM model <ref> [24] </ref> corresponds to the 1-arbitrary crossbar model. Assuming a complete interconnection between processors and memory modules, the c-collision (resp., c-arbitrary) DMM models of [9] corresponds to the c-collision (resp., c-arbitrary) crossbar model. We now return to the question of efficiently emulating an EREW PRAM on a c-collision crossbar. <p> The previously mentioned h-relation routing algorithm of Gereb-Graus and Tsantilas [10] is a direct algorithm, and direct h-relation routing algorithms have also been studied in [11, 12]. We refer the reader to these previous papers for further details. (For previous work on non-direct h-relation routing on the OCPC, see <ref> [5, 11, 12, 24] </ref>; for recent work that also incorporates redundancy-based techniques, see [13].) There is a close correspondence between results for the Control Tower problem and results for direct h-relation routing on a 1-collision crossbar.

Reference-contexts: That is what we analyze in this section. Our lower bound will make use of a result of Yao <ref> [25] </ref>, which states that any lower bound for deterministic algorithms on random inputs implies the same lower bound for randomized algorithms on worst case inputs. <p> If A succeeds in T (n; h) steps with probability at least 1 n 3=4 , then for some constant " &gt; 0, T (n; h) " log h log n. Proof: With " = 10 5 , this Corollary follows from Theorem 15 and Yao <ref> [25, Theorem 1] </ref> Corollary 15.2 Let h 2, and let A be a randomized algorithm for direct routing of an h-relation on a 1-collision crossbar with n processors. <p> Also, for all h 2, if n &lt; 2 100 or h n 1=3 , h 10 6 log h log n, so the claimed bound on T (n; h) is trivial. In the case of n 2 100 and h &lt; n 1=3 , by Yao <ref> [25, Theorem 1] </ref>, we only need to show that the lower bound holds for the expected time of any deterministic algorithm over some input distribution. We choose an input distribution as follows.
