Abstract: The new technologies of computer systems and artificial intelligence enable new directions in art. One new direction is the creation of highly interactive works based on computation. We describe several interactive artworks and show that there are strong similarities that transcend categories such as drama, music, and dance. Examining interactive art as a general approach, we identify one important dimension of variability having to do with the degree to which the art is focused on the process of interaction as opposed to generating a final product. The model that results from our analysis suggests future directions and forms of interactive art. We speculate what some of these new forms might be like.

Reference-contexts: Armed with a unifying model for interactive art, we will look at some other examples and suggest some new approaches to interactive visual arts and interactive dance. 2. Interactive Drama: The Woggles in Edge of Intention Our first example is Edge of Intention, a preliminary step toward interactive drama <ref> (Bates et al. 1992) </ref>. Edge of Intention is a virtual world that contains three autonomous animated creatures, called Woggles (see Figure 1). Each Woggle has goals, emotions, and personality, and expresses these through movement and facial expression.

Reference-contexts: Previous efforts to use technology in the service of dance include design and notation systems for choreography such as LifeForms (Schiphorst 1993) or Motigraphicon (Ungvary, Waters, and Rajka 1992). Others have investigated the use of computers to create dance or to suggest movements <ref> (Brightman 1989) </ref>. Notation systems are certainly interactive, but the interaction is between the choreographer and the design system. Furthermore, there is no ability to generate choreography from within the system.

Reference-contexts: Players are found in the traditional performing arts. Here their role is expert interpretation of the authors (or composers, choreographers, or playwrights) work. Player Author Interactive Drama System Audience 4 3. Interactive Music: Nitely News Nitely News <ref> (Dannenberg 1994) </ref> is a work for a live performer interacting with a computer music and animation system. (See Figure 5.) The object of the interactivity is to combine elements of improvisation and formal composition in live performance.

Reference-contexts: The solution in Edge of Intention is to use a computer system to carry out the goals of the author. <ref> (Loyall and Bates 1993) </ref> Rather than authoring a specific dramatic interaction, the author creates an interactive system capable of generating any number of dramatic interactions in response to input from the player.

Reference-contexts: In recent years, ACM SIGGRAPH (Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Graphics and Interactive Techniques) has paid increasing attention to interactive systems including interactive art. The Machine Culture exhibit at the 1993 SIGGRAPH conference <ref> (Penny 1993) </ref> is an excellent example. Interactive art is an important development that is enabled by computer technology. By analyzing examples of interactive art, we can achieve a better understanding of existing and future works.

Reference-contexts: Of course, systems have varying degrees of sophistication, so there is no sharp boundary between interactive and noninteractive art. The models also rule out artistic but noninteractive systems. For example, the Aaron program of Harold Cohen is a famous image-making system based on artificial intelligence techniques <ref> (Roads 1979, McCorduck 1991) </ref>. This system is outside the scope of our models because there is no significant interaction component. The system does act as an agent of the artist, but the purpose is not to allow real-time interaction with a player.

Reference-contexts: The system is very effective in evoking dance-like whole-body movements. Mandala (Warme 1994) is a low-cost commercial system apparently based on this work. Rokebys Very Nervous System and The Desert Dreams a Mirage Silicon Meets Carbon, 1992 <ref> (Rokeby 1993) </ref> use cameras as motion sensors. Movement affects music or sounds and images which are generated in real time. The Very Nervous System is especially effective with dance movements.

Reference-contexts: There are intermediate points as well. Consider the interactive art installation of Karl Sims <ref> (Sims 1993) </ref> at the Pompidou Center. A computer generates a set of images, each of which is displayed on a video monitor. Each monitor is on a pedestal and there is a pressure sensitive pad on the floor in front of each monitor.
