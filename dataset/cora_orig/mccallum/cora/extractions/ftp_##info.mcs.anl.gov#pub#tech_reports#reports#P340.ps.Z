Abstract: This article addresses the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model for high-temperature super-conductivity in thin films (two-dimensional periodic domains). A new gauge is defined to reduce the coupling between the equations for the nonzero components of the vector potential. The GL equations are written in a novel form by means of continuous link variables; this form is symmetric and has particular advantages for numerical analysis. The continuous GL model is approximated by a discrete model, which is shown to be second-order accurate. Two methods are used for the numerical solution of the discrete model|a modified Newton's method, in combination with a sweeping algorithm for the solution of the linear system, and a time-like integration method based on gradient flow. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the discrete GL model leads to asymmetric solutions in the plane; symmetry is recovered only in the limit as the mesh size goes to zero. The results of computational experiments to find the upper critical field and establish an empirical power law for vortex interactions are given.

Reference-contexts: The parameter is the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, which is the ratio of the London penetration depth (the length scale for variations of B) and the coherence length. As was first demonstrated analytically by Abrikosov <ref> [2] </ref>, superconducting materials with &gt; 1= 2 can sustain a spatially regular pattern of vortices, which are generated much like in fluid dynamics by the circular motion of superelectrons around normal cores. <p> In this article, we are concerned with thin-film superconductors in a uniform applied magnetic field normal to the plane of the film. This configuration gives rise to a two-dimensional problem on a periodic domain. The problem has been discussed by many authors, beginning with Abrikosov <ref> [2] </ref>. We mention in particular two recent articles by Du et al. [3] and [4], who discuss several mathematical aspects of the GL model and its numerical approximation by means of finite elements.

Reference-contexts: The GL model in two-dimensional periodic domains has been the subject of several numerical investigations, most recently by means of optimization techniques; for example, see Doria et al. <ref> [5] </ref>, Wang and Hu [6], and Garner et al. [7]. 1.2 Summary of the Results In this article we present at least six new results. * We show that a discrete GL model leads to asymmetric solutions in the plane. <p> For example, one finds the choice = 1, C 1 = 0, and C 2 = 1 2 (fi=ff)BL 2 in [8]; = 0, C 1 = 0, and C 2 = 0 in [4] and [9]; the choice (2.6), with fi = 0, is the same as in <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> Normally, we take fl = 0, so A x is constant along the lower egde of . 6 Remark. Doria et al. <ref> [5] </ref> erroneously claimed that the gauge can be chosen so that A x is identically zero. The error was pointed out by Wang and Hu [6]. <p> Having found the solution ( ; A x ; A y ), we compute the kinetic and field energy according to (4.2) and (4.3). Then the applied magnetic field H follows from (4.1). Doria et al. used this procedure to compute the lower critical field H c1 in <ref> [5] </ref>. Here we demonstrate that the same procedure can be used to compute the upper critical field H c2 . In Figure 7, we present the result of such an experiment. The data are for a two-vortex cell, with ff = p 3 and fi = 1.

Reference-contexts: The coefficient matrix is sparse, so the solution can be accomplished by means of special sparse-matrix techniques of numerical linear algebra. This approach has been applied with success, for example by Jones and Plassmann <ref> [11] </ref>. We have applied an alternative approach, based on the sweeping algorithm described in [12]. The method is similar to the shooting method for the numerical solution of two-point boundary value problems for second-order differential equations.

The method is similar to the shooting method for the numerical solution of two-point boundary value problems for second-order differential equations. <p> One difficulty with the sweeping algorithm is that ! and can grow quite rapidly; the algorithm thus becomes prone to rounding errors. Furthermore, the rectifying matrix R becomes more ill-conditioned as N x gets large. We have used two modifications to overcome these difficulties; cf. <ref> [12] </ref>. A multistage sweeping algorithm divides the columns into several smaller sweeping ranges. A rectifying matrix is computed for each range; the global rectifying matrix is then constructed either explicitly or implicitly from these local rectifying matrices. The algorithm is still a direct method for inverting the stencil.

Reference-contexts: Although t is introduced purely for numerical reasons, the system of equations (3.41) may reflect, at least qualitatively, the time evolution of a super-conducting medium near T c from a given initial state; see, for example, <ref> [13] </ref>. 17 So far, all solution techniques for the time-dependent system use the method of relax-ation, albeit the simple forward Euler method for parabolic equations. The difficulty is the severe limitation on the time step, t &lt; h x h y =4, needed to ensure convergence.

Reference-contexts: This transition occurs at the upper critical field H c2 . Computationally, one can simulate this physical experiment by decreasing the size of the unit cell, while keeping the number of vortices per unit cell fixed. The procedure is based on the discrete virial theorem of Doria et al. <ref> [14] </ref>; in our system of units, the virial theorem is 2 BH = 1 2 (G kin + 2G field ); virial (4:1) where G kin and G field are the kinetic and field energy per unit area, G kin = jj j@ x (U fl y )j 2 dxdy; Ekin
