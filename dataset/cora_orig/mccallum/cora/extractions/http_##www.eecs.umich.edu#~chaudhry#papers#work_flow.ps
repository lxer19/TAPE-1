Abstract: While the area of process automation in semiconductor manufacturing has many issues in common with process automation and enactment in business processes, the nature of the semiconductor manufacturing process introduces a number of challenging new issues. Among these issues is the need to not only automate the process but also to continuously control and optimize it. Furthermore the semantics of success/failure for a semiconductor manufacturing process are quite different from the typical binary success/failure of business processes. In this paper, the issues in process automation in semiconductor manufacturing are presented, and compared and contrasted with the issues in traditional workow technology. We then describe a system, based on an active database management system, that we have developed for process automation in semiconductor manufacturing. We also discuss the approach of this system towards addressing the different issues in the automation of semiconductor manufacturing processes.

Reference-contexts: The CIM system may be conceptually divided into the following three layers <ref> [BCD94] </ref> (see Figure 1): The Corporate Layer serves as an interface between the manufacturing facility and (the workow system of) the business process. Decisions about the quantity and type of wafers to be fabricated are communicated to the facility using this layer.

Reference-contexts: The multi-step control rules thus may be imprecise. To provide this capability, we are currently focussing our attention on the issues of modeling and handling imprecise data and rules in active object-oriented databases. Note that for this research effort, we are building upon our previous research, described in <ref> [CMR94] </ref>, carried out to incorporate imprecision in the relational control database used by equipment controllers in the process layer (Figure 1). 4 Conclusions In this paper we have described the AC, a software controller that has been developed to automate as well as control semiconductor manufacturing processes.

Reference-contexts: over statistical parameters and the definition of imprecise control rules. 3 Solution for Process Automation and Control: The Active Controller The AC Architecture: To provide a framework for monitoring and control of a semiconductor manufacturing process over multiple processing steps, we have developed a software controller, the Active Controller (AC) <ref> [CMR95] </ref>. This controller is built utilizing active database technology. Multi-step control is facilitated through the use of Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules of the database.

Reference-contexts: A process in general can be composed of a hierarchy of sub-processes (or steps) along with different types of dependencies between these sub-processes. The workow system then provides capabilities to model and specify, as well as to implement and automate the process <ref> [KrS95] </ref>. A semiconductor manufacturing enterprise when considered at the level of the business process is, of course, very similar to other business processes.
