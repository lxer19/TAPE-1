Abstract: Numerical relations in logics are known to characterize, via the finite models of their sentences, polynomial advice nonuniform complexity classes. These are known to coincide with reduction classes of tally sets. Our contributions here are: 1/ a refinement of that characterization that individualizes the reduction class of each tally set, and 2/ characterizing logarithmic advice classes via numerical constants, both in the (rather easy) case of C/log and in the more complex case of Full-C/log; this proof requires to extend to classes below P the technical characterizations known for the class Full-P/log.

The expressive power of logics with numerical constants seems not to have been studied, although it is an easy exercise: each constant provides log n bits of information in a finite universe of size n.

Reference-contexts: Nonuniform complexity classes have many characterizations in various, sometimes surprising terms, and thus become of interest in several approaches to computational complexity. See <ref> [BDG95] </ref> and the references there. (They are defined in the preliminaries below.) In particular, [M90] proves that classes with polynomially long advice words are captured by the same logics that capture the corresponding uniform class, when they are extended by arbitrary numerical relations.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, Immerman extends first-order logic by transitive closure and deterministic transitive closure to capture NL and L respectively; that is FO (TC)[] captures NL and FO (dTC)[] captures L. We assume that all our logics can express the linear ordering and the BIT predicate, as in <ref> [BIS90] </ref>, either due to their own expressive power or by having them built-in as default numerical relations. We also assume closure under standard existential quantification and the usual connectives. 4. Logical characterizations of logarithmic advice classes Logical characterizations of some polynomial advice classes are presented by Molzan in [M90].

Reference-contexts: Complexity-theoretic studies of these classes can be found in [BS92], [HM94], [BH97], and [BBH97], and a more global perspective is given in Hermo's PhD dissertation <ref> [H96] </ref>. For example, as polynomial size circuits correspond to P/poly (polynomial time with polynomial advice), likewise circuits with easy (Turing) descriptions correspond to P/log, and if these circuits can be combined via regular expression operators then Full-P/log is obtained (see [HM94], [BBH97]). <p> For some examples, NP/log, P/log, NL/log and L/log are captured by 1 1 [c], FO (LFP)[c], FO (TC)[c] and FO (dTC)[c] respectively. 5. Logical characterizations of Full logarithmic advice classes We turn now to consider full logarithmic advice classes. In <ref> [H96] </ref> it was proved that every language in Full-P/log has a prefixed advice function; that is, an advice function f : IN ! fl such that, for each n, f (n) is a prefix of f (n + 1). <p> These prefixed advice words will be selected as proposed in [BH97] (see <ref> [H96] </ref> for an analysis in depth of several variants of this construction, together with many consequences). <p> Then Pref-C= log = Full-C= log. This generalizes the analogous fact shown for P in [BH97] and <ref> [H96] </ref>. The proof consists simply in using the advice encoding described in the proof of Lemma 5.6; the capturability by a logic is needed to extract the needed advice word. 6.

Reference-contexts: Some cases are also described in [S94], [GL84], <ref> [I87] </ref>, [HMPST93] using classes defined by nonuniform circuits. The classes corresponding to logarithmic advice have been studied to a much lesser extent. <p> We say that a logic captures a class if they subsume each other. Many usual complexity classes are logically characterized in this sense. Namely, Fagin ([F74]) proved that the existential fragment of second-order logic captures NP; that is, 1 1 captures NP. Later, independently, Immerman <ref> [I87] </ref> and Vardi [Vardi82] proved that P was captured by the extension of first-order logic by a least-fixed point operator and an ordering on the universe; that is FO (LFP)[] captures P.

Reference-contexts: For C in fNP; P; NL; Lg, C (;) is abreviated C. By a nice complexity class we mean a reasonable complexity class (such as NP, P, NL, L, P/poly, P/log,... for some examples). Moreover, a nice complexity class has to be closed under first-order projection reductions <ref> [IL95] </ref>. Let F be a class of advice functions (functions from IN to fl ) and let C be a class of languages.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Many complexity classes are captured by appropriate logics. Here we focus on nonuniform complexity classes <ref> [KL80] </ref> originally introduced for dealing with computational models in which a different device is used for each input length; boolean circuits are an example of such a model. Nonuniform complexity classes have many characterizations in various, sometimes surprising terms, and thus become of interest in several approaches to computational complexity.

Reference-contexts: The classes corresponding to logarithmic advice have been studied to a much lesser extent. They come in two flavors: in the most general case, each advice word can be used only at a specific length, whereas in the most restrictive case (termed "strong" in <ref> [K87] </ref>, where they were introduced, and "Full" in more recent works) each advice word is also good for all smaller lengths. Complexity-theoretic studies of these classes can be found in [BS92], [HM94], [BH97], and [BBH97], and a more global perspective is given in Hermo's PhD dissertation [H96].

Logical characterizations of logarithmic advice classes Logical characterizations of some polynomial advice classes are presented by Molzan in <ref> [M90] </ref>. Namely, P/poly, L/poly and NL/poly are captured by FO (LFP)[R], FO (TC)[R] and FO (dTC)[R] respectively. These results are inmediately generalizable to give a logical characterization of C/poly provided a logical characterization of C is known.
