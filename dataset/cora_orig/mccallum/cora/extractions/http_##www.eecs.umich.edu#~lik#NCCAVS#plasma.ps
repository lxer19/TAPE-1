Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION The lack of feedback control and in-situ sensors in etch and other process equipment has been identified as one of the major problems facing the semiconductor industry <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. It is generally accepted that the main etch parameters which need to be controlled for reduction of process drift are the etch rate (or etch depth), anisotropy, selectivity, and uniformity across a wafer, typically from center to edge.

Reference-contexts: In previous papers our group [3-6] and others [7-9] have discussed the use of sensor-based real-time feedback control (RTC) as a method to reduce the process variations and increase the robustness of reactive-ion etch (RIE) processes. Real-time feedback control depends critically on non-invasive sensors for process parameters <ref> [3, 7-9] </ref>. We are conducting our etch sensor and control experiments in an Applied Materials 8300 Hexode Reactive Ion Etcher, a multi-wafer, low-pressure etch tool, without a load lock. We are using a CF 4 /O 2 chemistry for etching of polycrystalline silicon, with approximately 5% Ar for actinometry. <p> Therefore, our control strategy is to measure the internal plasma parameters and stabilize them through feedback adjustment of process parameters. In our previous work <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, we have attempted to control fluorine concentration and ion energy to 1 achieve a more constant etch rate. An actinometry system was used to estimate fluorine concentra-tions, and the DC bias (V bias ) measured at the matching network 1 was used as an indicator for ion energy. <p> Using actinometry, we estimate the fluorine concentration as [F ] act = K I F I Ar P , where P is the pressure 2 and K is a proportionality con stant <ref> [3] </ref>. We are continuing efforts to improve this model to account for Ar dilution effects [15]. <p> We have shown that we get accurate and fast measurements from this sensor system on unpatterned wafers. Both the open loop and closed loop etch rates versus time are lower in magnitude and show qualitatively different time responses than in our previous work <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. We have observed, in particular, that the behavior of I Ar is much less constant in our present machine state than in our previously reported experiments.

Reference-contexts: We are using a CF 4 /O 2 chemistry for etching of polycrystalline silicon, with approximately 5% Ar for actinometry. We chose CF 4 because it is the best understood chemistry for silicon etching. Even so, a number of factors have been strongly correlated with the etch rate <ref> [5, 9-12] </ref> . Among these, the fluorine concentration influences the chemical contribution to the silicon etch, whereas the formation of polymers inhibits the etching. Ion bombardment both removes the polymers by sputtering and enhances the surface reaction rate by reduction of surface binding energy. <p> EXPERIMENTAL DEMONSTRATION Using techniques from multi-variable control theory, we have designed feedback controllers to simultaneously control [F ] act , V bias , and pressure by making real-time adjustments of throttle valve position, power, and %O 2 flow.

Reference-contexts: While our emphasis is on the use of sensor systems for multi-variable RTC, we wish to point out that the sensor systems described in this paper can also be used with other methods of control, e.g. run-to-run control <ref> [13] </ref>, endpoint detection, etch characterization, or etch process diagnostics. ACTINOMETRY SENSOR SYSTEM The concentration of a chemical specie in a plasma is proportional to the intensity of the optical emission of that specie.

Reference-contexts: The validity of this method for fluorine concentration measurement in CF 4 /O 2 plasmas with Ar as the actinometer has been demonstrated <ref> [14] </ref>. 1 The DC bias is acquired from an RF Services 8300RL impedance matching network, which has (among other features) an RF choke to block 13.56MHz and a 1.3 kHz low-pass filter. 2 Furthermore, for process control applications actinometry has the advantages of reducing the ef-fects of window transmission changes and

Reference-contexts: Using actinometry, we estimate the fluorine concentration as [F ] act = K I F I Ar P , where P is the pressure 2 and K is a proportionality con stant [3]. We are continuing efforts to improve this model to account for Ar dilution effects <ref> [15] </ref>. Light from the plasma glow is modulated to 1 kHz using a mechanical chopper and is passed via UV-grade bifurcated quartz fibers, through 475 nm cutoff order-sorting filters into a pair of SPEX 500M 1 2 meter monochromators with 1200 g/mm, 750 nm blaze gratings. <p> One possible reason our etch rate for CL1 is not as constant over time as we would expect may be the limitations of these estimators. Such issues are currently under investigation both here and at other institutions <ref> [15, 21-24] </ref>. Another possible source of variation are changes in the polymer deposition rate, a factor we hope to be able to monitor in the near future.

Reference-contexts: REFLECTOMETRY SENSOR SYSTEM We have constructed a real-time film thickness monitor using normal incidence spectral reflec-tometry (Figure 2). This technique allows measurement of transparent and semi-transparent thin films without optical order ambiguities and with minimal chamber modification. Thickness calculations are performed based on a rigorous thin-film optical model <ref> [16] </ref>, using nonlinear regression. In this work we are etching unpatterned polysilicon/silicon dioxide/silicon test wafers. We model the polysilicon, which has significant surface roughness as deposited, as a bulk layer and a surface roughness layer [17]. We fit those layers' refractive indices using the Bruggeman effective medium approximation (BEMA)[18].

A Computer Boards TM timer board provides a clock with 1 s accuracy that is used to calculate etch rates from our thickness calculations; more will be said about etch rate calculation in the next section.

Reference-contexts: Thus, when determining the optimal integration time, the 8 reduction of noise must be weighed against the thickness variation during the measurement. The data presented in Figure 4 are obtained by quadratic smoothing <ref> [20] </ref> over a 31-second window. Even with this smoothing, oscillations are present in the etch rate estimates. These seem to be due to small variations in the calculated polysilicon surface roughness (of the order of a few A), which we believe are caused by limitations in our model.

Reference-contexts: To improve the fluorine concentration estimator, we have added an Extrel mass spectrometer to our RIE to monitor the argon concentration to account for the dilution of the argon due to dissociation of the process gases after the plasma ignites, which will lead to a more accurate measurement <ref> [25] </ref>. We currently do not have methods to monitor either the polymer formation or wafer temperature, among other plasma parameters that affect the etch rate.
