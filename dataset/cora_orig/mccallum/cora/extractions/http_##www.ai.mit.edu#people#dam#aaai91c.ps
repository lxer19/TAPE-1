Abstract: This paper appeared in AAAI-91. A postscript electronic source for this paper can be found in ftp.ai.mit.edu:/pub/dam/aaai91c.ps. A bibtex reference can be found in ftp.ai.mit.edu:/pub/dam/dam.bib. Abstract This paper presents a simple, sound, complete, and systematic algorithm for domain independent STRIPS planning. Simplicity is achieved by starting with a ground procedure and then applying a general, and independently verifiable, lifting transformation. Previous planners have been designed directly as lifted procedures. Our ground procedure is a ground version of Tate's NONLIN procedure. In Tate's procedure one is not required to determine whether a prerequisite of a step in an unfinished plan is guaranteed to hold in all linearizations. This allows Tate's procedure to avoid the use of Chapman's modal truth criterion. System-aticity is the property that the same plan, or partial plan, is never examined more than once. Systematic-ity is achieved through a simple modification of Tate's procedure.

Reference-contexts: The earliest planners were based on resolution theorem proving and inherited their lifted nature from the lifting lemma of resolution ( Fikes and Nilsson 1971 ) <ref> ( Robinson 1965 ) </ref> . In addition to being lifted, most modern planners are "nonlinear" | they maintain a partial order on plan steps rather than a total order. <p> This implies that, unlike the procedure given here, the search would still not be a systematic search of operation sequences. Lifting Lifting was invented by J. A. Robinson in conjunction with the development of resolution theorem proving <ref> ( Robinson 1965 ) </ref> . Lifting is now a standard technique in the construction of new theorem proving and term rewriting algorithms.
