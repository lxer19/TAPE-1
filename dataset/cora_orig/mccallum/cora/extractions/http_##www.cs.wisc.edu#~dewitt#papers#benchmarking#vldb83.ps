Reference-contexts: More specifically we have measured and compared the performance of the database machine DIRECT <ref> [DEWI79, BORA82] </ref>, the Britton-Lee IDM/500 database machine with and without a database accelerator (DAC) [IDM500, EPST80, UBEL81], the "commercial" and "university" versions of the INGRES database system [STON76, STON80], and the ORACLE database system. <p> version on a VAX 11/750 running the VMS operating system) the 3 ORACLE database management system on a VAX 11/750 running 4.2 Berkeley Unix, the IDM 500 connected to a PDP 11/70 host, and a DIRECT prototype in which the same VAX 11/750 is used as the host and back-end-controller <ref> [BORA82] </ref>. Detailed descriptions of the design and implementation stages for the research projects that led to the current versions of INGRES and DIRECT can be found in several published papers referenced throughout this section. <p> The Database Machine DIRECT DIRECT [DEWI79] is a multiprocessor database machine, that was designed and implemented at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The initial design was proposed in 1977. A complete description of the architecture and the software structure for the current implementation of DIRECT can be found in <ref> [BORA82] </ref>. The basic idea that motivated the DIRECT project was that a multiprocessor back-end machine for INGRES (or any relational database system) could dramatically enhance performance.

Reference-contexts: For example, several years of experience with the INGRES database management system has led to the development of a commercial version of this system hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 1 Especially in the face of limited I/O bandwidth. See <ref> [BORA83] </ref> for a discussion of the impact of trends in mass storage technology on the future of highly parallel database machines. 2 As of April 1983, approximately two hundred IDM 500 and IDM 200 database machines had been shipped. 2 on several general purpose computers. <p> These results reinforce the conclusions made in <ref> [BORA83] </ref>, that one needs only 2-3 conventional processors (and not hundreds of processors or custom VLSI components) to process selection queries at the rate of conventional disk drives. Table 1 provides another interesting result about the cost of coordinating processors working in parallel.

It seemed that both successful research efforts and advances in hardware technology would lead to the widespread use of commercial database machines. <p> It is important to realize, however, that the degree of this bias is highly dependent on the query type, the availability of suitable indices, and whether the performance of the IDM is CPU limited or I/O limited. 2.4. The Database Machine DIRECT DIRECT <ref> [DEWI79] </ref> is a multiprocessor database machine, that was designed and implemented at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The initial design was proposed in 1977. A complete description of the architecture and the software structure for the current implementation of DIRECT can be found in [BORA82]. <p> the inner relation is converted to a hashed organization before the join is initiated (2) Commercial INGRES uses primarily sort-merge join techniques. (3) The IDM 500, with and without the DAC, and ORACLE use a simple nested loops join (O (n 2 )) algorithm. (4) DIRECT uses a parallel version <ref> [DEWI79] </ref> of the simple nested loops join algorithm. Third, we were interested in how the different systems took advantage of secondary indices on joining attributes, when these were available. Finally, we wanted to see how the database accelerator impacted join times.

Reference-contexts: Our results also provide some insight into to the extent to which a "conventional" operating system "gets in the way of" a database management system <ref> [STON81] </ref> as the IDM 500 without a database accelerator really represents the performance of a database management system running on a conventional processor (a ZILOG Z8000) WITHOUT a general purpose operating system getting in the way. <p> University INGRES does no buffer management of its own relying instead on the Unix operating system to buffer database pages. As discussed in <ref> [STON81] </ref>, buffer management strategies that are good at managing virtual memory pages are frequently very poor at choosing the "right" page to eject in a database environment.

It uses a standard 16-bit microprocessor chip (Zilog Z8000). The processor runs a special-purpose operating system, that schedules disk accesses intelligently.
