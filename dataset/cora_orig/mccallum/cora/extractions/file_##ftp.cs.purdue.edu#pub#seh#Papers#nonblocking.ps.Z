Abstract: Edge reductions model the ability of speeding up communication between processors in a network. In this paper we consider performing edge reductions in a tree network so that the diameter of the tree is minimized. The diameter is directly related to the time needed to broadcast a message. In particular, for non-blocking message communication ignoring start-up costs, the diameter corresponds to the broadcasting time. For an n-vertex tree T and a quantity B, we present an O(n) time algorithm to determine edge reductions such that the resulting tree has diameter at most B and the cost of the reduction is a minimum (over all reductions resulting in a diameter of at most B). fl Research supported in part by DARPA under contract DABT63-92-C-0022ONR.

Reference-contexts: Our work thus determines where to locate the faster communication links in order to reduce the broadcasting time. Edge reductions in longest path computations with applications in circuit layout and project management have been studied in [4]. Edge reductions for blocking communication models are considered in <ref> [3] </ref>. Let T = (V; E) be an undirected, weighted, n-vertex tree representing a broadcasting network. The weight of edge (i; j), w (i; j), represents the time needed for sending a message from vertex i to vertex j.

We point out that the algorithm determines the reductions as done in the problem of finding edge reduction minimizing the longest path length in trees described in <ref> [4] </ref>. However, the arguments as to why the approach is correct are different for the two problems.
