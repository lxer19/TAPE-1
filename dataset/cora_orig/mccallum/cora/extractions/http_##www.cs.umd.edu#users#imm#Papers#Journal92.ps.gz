Abstract: We examine two approaches to adaptive routing protocols for wide-area store-and-forward networks, namely, distance-vector and link-state. Distance-vector algorithms have less storage requirements than link-state algorithms. The ARPANET started with a distance-vector algorithm (Distributed Bellman-Ford), but because of long-lived loops, changed to a link-state algorithm (SPF). We evaluate, using a recently developed network simulator, MaRS, the transient and steady-state performance of SPF and two newly proposed distance-vector algorithms (ExBF and MS). Overall, SPF and ExBF have comparable performance and MS is worse. fl This work is supported in part by RomeLabs and DARPA under contract F30602-90-C-0010 to UMIACS at the University of Maryland, and by National Science Foundation Grant No. NCR 89-04590.

Reference-contexts: Given the current understanding of next-hop routing algorithms, we feel that simulations are probably the only way to develop further insight into their performance. We use a recently developed simulator called MaRS (Maryland Routing Simulator) <ref> [2] </ref>. We consider three algorithms: SPF; Merlin-Segall, henceforth called MS; and Extended Bellman-Ford, henceforth called ExBF. We consider the NSFNET-T1-backbone network with T1 hardware as well as a high-speed hardware, with varying uniform and hotspot-with-background workloads, and varying failure patterns. <p> The scheduling of events can be done using random number generators, a trace file, or both. MaRS is implemented in C on a UNIX environment. It has an optional graphical (X Window System) interface. It is available publicly in the Internet by anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.umd.edu <ref> [2] </ref>. A network configuration consists of a physical network, a routing algorithm, and a workload. These are described in the following paragraphs. The physical network consists of nodes and links.

Reference-contexts: However it is well known that the straight-forward distributed implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm can have long-lived loops giving rise to large dissemination times, i.e. of the order of distances <ref> [3] </ref>. The ARPANET initially used this Distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm. Because of its long dissemination time, it was replaced in 1979 by a link state algorithm referred to as SPF (Shortest Path First) [24]. At that time, the link cost function was link delay. <p> For example, reference [10] considers a queueing system with two identical independent exponential servers and determines an optimal way to route incoming packets to one of the two servers based on their "instantaneous" queue sizes. Imposing more assumptions results in more tractable flow models <ref> [3, 11] </ref>. Here, each link is modeled by a capacity and propagation time, and the message traffic on the link is modeled by a continuous-valued flow, representing the average rate of the message traffic. The routing problem is then formulated as an optimization problem. <p> Typically, the solution procedure is iterative. Flow models have been used to study both link-state algorithms [4] and distance-vector algorithms [14]. A serious limitation of flow models is the assumption that flows are static (or quasi-static) <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 Overview of Routing Algorithms This section describes the routing algorithms examined in our simulations. All of them use next-hop routing. At a node, the next-hop for a destination can be nil (e.g. because the destination is not reachable from the node). <p> If this causes a change in a minimum distance, it sends the new minimum distance to its neighbors; if as a result a minimum distance of a neighbor changes, it repeats the process. The above distance-vector algorithm is the classical Distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm <ref> [3, 12] </ref>. It is well known that this algorithm, in addition to short-lived next-hop loops, can have long-lived loops of duration proportional to link cost changes [29]. The new distance-vector algorithms have mechanisms to avoid long-lived loops. MS is a distance-vector algorithm which avoids both short-lived and long-lived loops.

Reference-contexts: Experience showed that this leads to unstable oscillations, and in 1987 it was replaced by a more slowly changing hop-normalized-delay function, which uses exponential averaging, movement limit, etc [21]. Since 1979, many new kinds of distance-vector algorithms have been proposed <ref> [25, 30, 19, 6, 15, 29] </ref> which achieve significantly reduced dissemination times by using node coordination mechanisms. The Merlin-Segall algorithm [25, 30] has a worst-case dissemination time of O (H 2 ) hop count, where H is the length of a maximum length shortest path between any two nodes. <p> The worst-case dissemination time is O (H ) for the Jaffe-Mosse algorithm [19] and the DUAL algorithm by Garcia-Luna-Aceves [15], and is O (N ) for the Extended Bellman-Ford algorithm by Cheng et al. <ref> [6] </ref>. However, in terms of real time they may have successively smaller dissemination times because they impose successively weaker coordination constraints.

Reference-contexts: SPF) [24] and its new link cost function (i.e. hop-normalized-delay function) [21]. The tests showed that the new algorithm and link cost function give better performance than the old ARPANET algorithm (i.e. Distributed Bellman-Ford) and the old delay function. Regarding simulation approaches, reference <ref> [7] </ref> concluded that an adaptive strategy is needed in a skewed workload environment. For SPF, it investigated the effects of the link cost function parameters and demonstrated optimal settings. In [35], the original and new ARPANET algorithms (i.e. <p> Such packets are temporarily buffered in a "produce window". 6 Simulation Parameters In this section, we describe the range of parameters exercised in our simulations. Assumptions and parameters were predetermined either consistently with those made in the literature, e.g. [24] [21] [16] <ref> [7] </ref>, or from statistics provided by Merit/NSFNET Information Services, or by simulations with MaRS. <p> The explanation we have is the following: in general we have observed that SPF recovers faster in response to step changes in the workload and link failure/repair. We think that this leads to oscillations in routes 10 which degrade performance under uniform workload <ref> [7] </ref>, while under skewed workload, these route changes would cause the use of under-utilized links. (A.2) Transient measures versus varying step changes in uniform workload. In response to a step change, SPF recovers faster than ExBF which recovers faster than MS.

Reference-contexts: SPF is a link-state algorithm where (1) each node calculates and broadcasts the costs of its outgoing links periodically or whenever a failure/repair occurs, and (2) Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm <ref> [8] </ref> is applied to the view of the network topology to determine next-hops. Distance-Vector Algorithms In the distance-vector approach, for each destination d, every node i maintains a set of distances fD i (j)g where j ranges over the neighbors of i.

Reference-contexts: For each destination, MS guarantees that the next-hops on the nodes that can reach the destination form a 6 tree rooted at the destination. MS attains loop-free paths by coordinating the next-hop updates for each destination as a diffusion computation <ref> [9] </ref> which is started by the destination. When a failure/repair occurs, a request message is sent to each destination. Periodically or upon receiving a request message, the destination starts a new diffusion computation. (The diffusion computation is as follows.

Reference-contexts: The obvious analytical approach is to use a queueing network model where routing is based on delayed state information. Unfortunately, this is usually intractable.

Reference-contexts: The dissemination time is small and proportional to D where D is the network diameter in hops. The distance-vector approach, which is based on the Bellman-Ford algorithm <ref> [12] </ref>, is more subtle: each node maintains for each destination a set of distances, one for each of its neighbors. 1 Oscillations are caused by the delayed feedback between route changes and link cost changes. For example, suppose the network has two similar paths between a source and a destination. <p> If this causes a change in a minimum distance, it sends the new minimum distance to its neighbors; if as a result a minimum distance of a neighbor changes, it repeats the process. The above distance-vector algorithm is the classical Distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm <ref> [3, 12] </ref>. It is well known that this algorithm, in addition to short-lived next-hop loops, can have long-lived loops of duration proportional to link cost changes [29]. The new distance-vector algorithms have mechanisms to avoid long-lived loops. MS is a distance-vector algorithm which avoids both short-lived and long-lived loops.

In this paper, we use the hop-normalized-delay function of the ARPANET <ref> [21] </ref>. Here the transmitting node monitors the average packet delay (queueing and transmission) and average packet transmission time for the link during the last update period. From these, assuming an M=M=1 model, it calculates the utilization, which it uses as the raw cost. <p> MaRS currently provides three routing algorithms, SPF, MS, ExBF (described in section 3), and four types of link cost functions based on hop count, utilization, delay, and hop-normalized-delay. The link cost function used in this paper is the hop-normalized-delay function of the ARPANET <ref> [24, 21] </ref> (described in section 4). The workload is defined in terms of connections. Each connection is associated with a source node and a sink node. The source produces packets destined for the sink.

Reference-contexts: In every scenario examining steady-state performance, the number of packets in the network is upper bounded because each connection can have at most one send window's worth of packets in the network. Therefore, as the workload increases, the network behaves more as a closed queueing 13 network <ref> [22] </ref>. That is, the data load and throughput first increase linearly, and then level off as the system becomes saturated. The delay increases very slowly at first, and then very rapidly after the saturation point. <p> The poorer the performance, the longer the duration, resulting in more connections being active simultaneously. Thus, the number of connections varies with time, and the system behavior is similar to that of an open queueing network <ref> [22] </ref>. Our conclusions in [31] agree with those in this paper. The only difference is that the dynamic workload results in higher delay and earlier saturation, as expected.

Reference-contexts: Reference [37] compared SPF, Distributed Bellman 4 Ford and DUAL algorithms with respect to measures such as number of paths with loops after a node/link change. However, it has no workload and assumes unit link delays and zero processing time at the nodes. Reference <ref> [26] </ref> compared SPF, Gallager's algorithm [13], and the CODEX algorithm [17, 18]. It was shown that SPF with the old delay link cost function performs poorly compared to the other two algorithms in terms of packet delay under moderate to heavy traffic conditions.

Reference-contexts: It was observed that a shorter link-cost update period should be used for higher data workload. In [36], an extension to SPF was proposed where alternate paths are used in case of congestion and failures. It was concluded that the proposed algorithm gives higher throughput than SPF. In <ref> [27] </ref>, multi-path extensions to SPF were shown to perform better. Here, each node finds the min hop and min plus 1 hop paths for every destination, estimates their delays and chooses between them accordingly.

It is well known that this algorithm, in addition to short-lived next-hop loops, can have long-lived loops of duration proportional to link cost changes <ref> [29] </ref>. The new distance-vector algorithms have mechanisms to avoid long-lived loops. MS is a distance-vector algorithm which avoids both short-lived and long-lived loops. For each destination, MS guarantees that the next-hops on the nodes that can reach the destination form a 6 tree rooted at the destination.

Reference-contexts: This implies that short-lived loops do not degrade performance. And the diffusion computation mechanism used by MS causes MS to adapt too slowly. (These conclusions held even in the high-speed network we studied.) The simulations in this paper typically considered a constant number of unending connections. Elsewhere <ref> [31] </ref>, we considered a more dynamic workload, where each source initiates a succession of finite file transfer connections to its sink. The duration of a connection, i.e. the time to deliver the data packets of a file, depends on the routing protocol performance. <p> The poorer the performance, the longer the duration, resulting in more connections being active simultaneously. Thus, the number of connections varies with time, and the system behavior is similar to that of an open queueing network [22]. Our conclusions in <ref> [31] </ref> agree with those in this paper. The only difference is that the dynamic workload results in higher delay and earlier saturation, as expected.
