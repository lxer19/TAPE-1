Reference-contexts: While it is effective, there are applications that cannot tolerate loss of data (e.g., medical data, the video signals collected from space by NASA <ref> [Doz92] </ref>). As an alternative, one may use a lossless compression technique (e.g., Huffman, Lempel Ziv, etc.). While a good estimate for reduction in size with these techniques is anywhere from a factor of 2 to 15, with lossy techniques it ranges from a factor of 10 to 500 [Fox91].

Reference-contexts: Each subobject X i represents a contiguous portion of X . When X is materialized from the tertiary storage device, its subobjects are assigned to the clusters in a round-robin manner, starting with an available cluster. In a cluster, a subobject is declustered <ref> [RE78, LKB87, GD90] </ref> into M pieces (termed fragments), with each fragment assigned to a different disk drive in the cluster. <p> Section 4 presents simulation results that compare staggered striping with an earlier technique termed virtual data replication.

Reference-contexts: The fragments of a subobject (say X 1 ) are constructed using a round-robin assignment of its blocks to each disk drive (see Figure 1), allowing the system to overlap the display of X 1 with its retrieval from the disk drives (multi-input pipelining <ref> [GRAQ91, GR93] </ref>). This minimizes the amount of memory required for buffering the data. However, in practice, some memory is needed per disk drive to eliminate hiccups that may arise due to disk seeks incurred when the system switches from one cluster to another (described further in Section 3). <p> There are several proposals which led to the work reported in this paper. In [GRAQ91] and <ref> [GR93] </ref>, the concept of declustering was extended to a parallel multimedia system based on the shared-nothing architecture [Sto86]. In [GS93], an architecture was defined with a tertiary storage device and described virtual data replication as a mechanism to support multiple users.

Reference-contexts: Already, these systems play a major role in educational applications, entertainment technology, and library information systems. A challenging task when implementing these systems is to support a continuous retrieval of an object at the bandwidth required by its media type <ref> [MWS93, SAD + 93, GRAQ91] </ref>. This is challenging because certain media types, in particular video, require very high bandwidths. <p> The fragments of a subobject (say X 1 ) are constructed using a round-robin assignment of its blocks to each disk drive (see Figure 1), allowing the system to overlap the display of X 1 with its retrieval from the disk drives (multi-input pipelining <ref> [GRAQ91, GR93] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: This simple striping technique is already a significant improvement over the virtual replication technique of <ref> [GS93] </ref>. As described in detail later, simple striping provides for more flexible allocation of disk bandwidth and more efficient use of disk storage capacity. <p> There are several proposals which led to the work reported in this paper. In [GRAQ91] and [GR93], the concept of declustering was extended to a parallel multimedia system based on the shared-nothing architecture [Sto86]. In <ref> [GS93] </ref>, an architecture was defined with a tertiary storage device and described virtual data replication as a mechanism to support multiple users. <p> In this section we compare simple striping (special case of staggered striping, implemented by setting k=M X ) with an earlier introduced technique termed virtual data replication <ref> [GS93] </ref> (described in Section 2). We start by describing the simulation model employed for both strategies and their parameters. Next, we summarize the performance results obtained. <p> We assumed a closed system where once a display 5 At the time of this writing, 4 gigabyte disk drives are commercially available (e.g., Acropolis Systems Inc.) at a cost of $0.82/megabyte of storage. 6 It was configured with the Minimum Response Time (MRT) state transition diagram <ref> [GS93] </ref>. 19 Disk Parameters Storage Capacity 4.54 gigabyte Number of Cylinders 3000 Storage Capacity of a Cylinder 1.512 megabyte Average Latency Time 8.33 msec Maximum Latency Time 16.83 msec B Disk 20 mbps Minimum Seek Time 4 msec Maximum Seek Time 35 msec Average Seek Time 15 msec Database Parameters Number

Reference-contexts: Future demands for even high bandwidth are expected. These bandwidth requirements have to be compared with the typical 20 mbps bandwidth of a magnetic disk drive 2 , which is not expected to increase significantly in the near future <ref> [PGK88] </ref>. A standard technique to support a continuous display of multimedia objects is to sacrifice the quality of data using a lossy compression technique (results in some loss of data). <p> Section 3 presents both simple and staggered striping techniques.

Reference-contexts: In summary, as one increases the size of a fragment, the display latency time increases (undesirable) while the effective disk bandwidth increases (desirable). To illustrate, a typical 1.2 gigabyte disk drive <ref> [Sab90] </ref> consists of 1635 cylinders, each with a capacity of 756000 bytes. Its peak transfer rate is 24.19 mbps. Its minimum, average, and maximum disk seek times are 4, 15, and 35 milliseconds respectively. Its average and maximum disk latency times are 8.33 and 16.83 milliseconds respectively.
