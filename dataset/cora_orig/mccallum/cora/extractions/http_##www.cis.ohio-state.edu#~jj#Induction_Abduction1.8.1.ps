Abstract: This paper describes abduction as inference to the best explanation and argues that smart inductive generalizations are a special case of abductions. Along the way it argues that some good explanations are not proofs and some proofs are not explanations, concluding that explanations are not deductive proofs in any particularly interesting sense. An attractive alternative is that explanations are assignments of causal responsibility. Smart inductive generalizations can then be seen to be abductions wherein the frequency in a statistical sample is best explained by a frequency in a parent population along with the method of drawing the sample. To postpone entanglements with the abundant confusions surrounding various uses of the term abduction, for which Peirce himself seems largely to be responsible, and to proceed as directly as possible to engage the basic logical and computational issues, let us begin by examining a pattern of inference I will call inference to the best explanation and abbreviate as IBE (IBEs for the plural).
