Reference-contexts: Let (L 1 ; : : : ; L r ) be arbitrary graphs. Let R = R fl (L 1 ; : : : ; L r ) be the largest integer satisfying the following condition (see Burr, Erd-os, Lovasz, <ref> [1] </ref>): for arbitrary large h, K R (h; : : : ; h) can be coloured in r colours without getting an L in the -th colour. Theorem 4*. Let L 1 ; : : : ; L r be arbitrary graphs.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that the Ramsey number R (k; 3) &gt; ck 2 = log 2 k (see Spencer [19], and also <ref> [2] </ref>, [3].). This implies that there exist graphs G m on m vertices, containing no K 3 , with ff (G m ) = O ( p And, obviously, this implies Claim 3.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, Corollary 1 implies Theorem 1. Remark. The Kneser graph KN (3m1; m) (as it easily follows from the Erdos-Ko-Rado Theorem <ref> [5] </ref>) satisfies property (fl). 2. OTHER PRODUCT CONSTRUCTIONS OF (K 3 ; K 3 )-CO-CRITICAL GRAPHS Often we shall have graphs satisfying instead of (fl) above the following much stronger condition. Condition (flfl).

Reference-contexts: 2 ); as n ! 1: Proof of Theorem 4*. (a) The lower bound of Theorem 4* is trivial again: by definition, T n;R fl can be r-coloured without monochromatic L in its -th colour. (b) To prove the upper bound of Theorem 4*, we shall use the Erd-os-Stone theorem <ref> [6] </ref>, according to which, for every and" &gt; 0 there exists an n 0 such that for n &gt; n 0 a graph G n not containing K t+1 (-; : : : ; -) has at most 1 2 + "n 2 edges.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 2 enables us to get many co-critical graphs. Notice that Claim 1 is now already proved by the foregoing. The first question that arises is this: which graphs can replace C 5 in Claim 1. One of them is the famous Kneser graph <ref> [10] </ref>. Definition 3. The Kneser graph KN (m; k) is a graph the vertices of which are the m k-tuples of an m-element set and two of these k-tuples are joined if they are disjoint. (The Petersen graph is also a Kneser graph, namely, KN (5; 2).) Corollary 1.

Reference-contexts: Take any graph G n described by Claim 3. Then G n G n is (K 3 ; K 3 )- co-critical. Construction 2. (Margulis-Lubotzky-Phillips-Sarnak [14], <ref> [11] </ref>) The non-bipartite Lu-botzky-Philips-Sarnak graphs have the property that their girth is large. (Besides, they satisfy (flfl).) They are not K 3 -saturated, but we can add edges to them until they become K 3 -saturated. <p> Take two such graphs, their product is (K 3 ; K 3 )-co-critical by Theorem 2. Remark. As to the independence number of the above graph, one can be more specific: taking the parameters in the LPS graph in <ref> [11] </ref> to be q p 3 we get a graph X n with ff (X n ) O (n 5=6 ). At this point it is worthwhile to emphasize what we have implicitly already observed, that each of the above constructions contains a C 5 C 5 .
