Title: LOWER BOUNDS ON UNIVERSAL TRAVERSAL SEQUENCES FOR CYCLES AND OTHER LOW DEGREE GRAPHS  
Author: MARTIN TOMPA 
Keyword: Key words. Universal traversal sequence, reflecting sequence, circumnavigation sequence, cycle, lower bound, graph traversal, time-space tradeoff  
Abstract: Universal traversal sequences for cycles require length (n 1:29 ), improving the previous bound of (n log n). For d 3, universal traversal sequences for d-regular graphs require length (d 0:71 n 2:29 ). For constant d, the best previous bound was (n 2 log n).

Reference-contexts: 1. Reflecting and Universal Traversal Sequences. Universal traversal sequences were introduced by Cook (see Aleliunas et al. <ref> [2] </ref>) as a particularly simple method for traversing graphs. Universal traversal sequences are defined as follows. For 2 d &lt; n, let G (d; n) be the set of all connected, d-regular, n-vertex, edge labeled, undirected graphs G = (V; E). For this definition, edges are labeled as follows.

Reference-contexts: U (d; n) denotes the length of a shortest universal traversal sequence for G (d; n). To avoid trivialities, define U (d; n) = U (d; n + 1) in case G (d; n) is empty, which occurs exactly when both d and n are odd (see <ref> [5, Proposition 1] </ref>). Good bounds on U (d; n) translate into good bounds on the time required by certain simple undirected graph traversal algorithms running in very limited space. <p> In particular, determining good lower bounds on U (d; n) is a prerequisite to proving time-space tradeoffs for traversing undirected graphs. (See Borodin, Ruzzo, and Tompa <ref> [5] </ref> for more detailed discussion.) Proving such lower bounds is the emphasis of this paper. The current best upper and lower bounds on U (d; n) are summarized in Table 1. (See Borodin, Ruzzo, and Tompa [5] for more background.) Prior to the current work, the best lower bound for d <p> prerequisite to proving time-space tradeoffs for traversing undirected graphs. (See Borodin, Ruzzo, and Tompa <ref> [5] </ref> for more detailed discussion.) Proving such lower bounds is the emphasis of this paper. The current best upper and lower bounds on U (d; n) are summarized in Table 1. (See Borodin, Ruzzo, and Tompa [5] for more background.) Prior to the current work, the best lower bound for d = 2 was U (2; n) = (n log n); due to Bar-Noy et al. [4]. <p> [6] U (d; n) = (n 1:29 ) d = 2 This paper U (d; n) = (d 0:71 n 2:29 ) 3 d &lt; n log 6 1:5 This paper U (d; n) = (d 2 n 2 ) n log 6 1:5 d n=3 2 Borodin et al. <ref> [5] </ref> U (d; n) = (n 2 ) n=3 2 &lt; d Alon et al.

[3] due to Borodin, Ruzzo, and Tompa [5]. <p> The key to relating reflecting sequences to universal traversal sequences of degree d 3 lies in the notion of "circumnavigation sequences", introduced by Borodin, Ruzzo, and Tompa <ref> [5] </ref>. For any labeled cycle C 2 G (2; n), a string over f0; 1g can be interpreted as a traversal sequence. <p> C (t; n) denotes the length of a shortest t-circumnavigation sequence for G (2; n). The next theorem, due to Borodin, Ruzzo, and Tompa <ref> [5] </ref>, relates universal traversal sequences of higher degree graphs to circumnavigations of cycles. Theorem 1.2 ([5, Section 4.1]). Let d 3 be an integer, and n be a multiple of 8 (d 1). <p> Although U (d; n) is not known to be monotone in n, it is true that U (d; n) U (d; n 0 ) (Borodin, Ruzzo, and Tompa <ref> [5, Section 3] </ref>).
