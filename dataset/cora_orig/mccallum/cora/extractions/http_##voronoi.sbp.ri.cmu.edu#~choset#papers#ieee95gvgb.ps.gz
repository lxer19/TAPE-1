Abstract: This paper prescribes an incremental procedure to construct the Generalized Voronoi Graph (GVG) and the Hierarchical Generalized Voronoi Graph (HGVG) detailed in the companion paper [4]. The procedure requires only local distance sensor measurements, and therefore the method can be used as a basis for sensor based planning algorithms.

Reference-contexts: In this case, it is necessary to build a link to the disconnected component that surrounds the goal. The linking strategy is a special case of the strategy one would use to link GVG cycles to other Second Order GVG edges <ref> [3] </ref>. 5 Constructing the Second Order GVG The second (and higher) order GVG can be incrementally constructed in a highly analogous fashion.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In <ref> [4] </ref> we introduced a set of 1-dimensional curves which we termed the Generalized Voronoi Graph (GVG), and its extension, the Hierarchical Generalized Voronoi Graph (HGVG). These curves are retract-like, in that they have the useful properties of accessibility and departability. <p> Furthermore, under conditions stated in the companion paper, the HGVG is connected, and thus can form the basis for a complete motion planning scheme. We assume that the reader is familiar with the definitions and results in the companion paper <ref> [4] </ref>. In this paper, we develop methods to incrementally construct the GVG and HGVG. It is worth noting that the incremental construction procedure can be used to construct the retract-like network when full geometry of the world is available. <p> This procedure requires only local sensor distance measurement data, and is therefore practically implementable, as demonstrated by our experiments. Hence, the Generalized Voronoi Graph and Hierarchical Generalized Voronoi Graph introduced in <ref> [4] </ref> appear to be useful means for implementing sensor based motion planning algorithms. We also believe that with small modifications, some of the numerical methods introduced in this paper can also be useful for "sensorizing" other (e.g., the OPP method) robot motion planners.

Reference-contexts: However, gradient ascent can be a computationally expensive procedure because of its slow convergence. Also, the constant step direction leads to undesirable roadmap artifacts [2]. Our approach borrows some basic ideas and techniques from numerical continuation methods <ref> [5] </ref>. Continuation methods are used to trace the roots of the expression G (y; ) = 0 as the parameter is varied. The incremental construction of a GVG edge can be implemented as as follows. Let x be a point on the GVG. <p> Hence, if G is surjective, then the implicit function theorem implies that the roots of G (y; ) locally define a Generalized Voronoi Edge as is varied. By numerically tracing the roots of this function, we can locally construct an edge. While there are a number of such techniques <ref> [5] </ref>, we use an adaptation of a common predictor-corrector scheme. Assume that the robot is located at a point x on the GVG. The robot takes a "small" step, , in the z 1 -direction (i.e., the tangent to the local GVG edge).

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, they do not provide a rigorous way to construct the freeway segments from sensor data. In contrast, this paper formulates a methodical construction of the roadmap segments from sensor data. One incremental approach which creates Voronoi Diagram-like structures can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>, but it is restricted to the planar case. The GVG's and HGVG's properties of accessibility, de partability and connectivity translate to incremental accessibility, incremental departability, and traceability, respectively, in the incremental construction of the GVG.

Reference-contexts: However, the construction of "bridge curves," which guarantee the roadmap's connectivity, requires the identification of "interesting critical points." Complete prior knowledge of the world's geometry is needed to identify the critical points. This is a major limitation of their algorithm for sensor based implementation. Rimon and Canny <ref> [7] </ref> have recently suggested a way to "sensorize" the OPP algorithm. They introduce the notion of a "critical point sensor," though the implementation of such a sensor is not well detailed.

Reference-contexts: We briefly review other relevant work in sensor based or incremental planning schemes. Many sensor based schemes have been developed, mostly for the planar case (see <ref> [8] </ref> for a review of planar sensor based planning). However, very little analysis of the numerical properties of these schemes has been done. This paper presents a more thorough analysis of the numerical properties of our algorithm than is typical in the sensor based planning literature.
