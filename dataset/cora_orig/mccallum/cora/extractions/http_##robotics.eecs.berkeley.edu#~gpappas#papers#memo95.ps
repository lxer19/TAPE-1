Reference-contexts: Proof: See Munkres <ref> [1] </ref> page 220. 2 Example: Let V = R n with the standard basis e 1 ; : : : ; e n and let 1 ; : : : ; n be the dual basis. <p> Proof: See Munkres <ref> [1] </ref> page 220. 2 Because of their multilinear structure, two tensors are equal if they agree on any set of basis elements. Theorem 3 Let a 1 ; : : : ; a n be a basis for V . <p> Proof: See Munkres <ref> [1] </ref> page 221. 2 Theorem 3 allows us to construct a basis for the space L k (V ). Theorem 4 Let a 1 ; : : : ; a n be a basis for V . <p> Distributivity (f + g) h = f h + g h 4. Given a basis a 1 ; : : : ; a n for V , the basis tensors satisfy I = i 1 i 2 ; : : : ; i k Proof: See Munkres <ref> [1] </ref> page 224. 2 We can also define the tensor product of two subspaces U; W V fl as U W := spanfx 2 L 2 (V ) j x = u w; u 2 U; w 2 W g: Therefore, from Theorem 4 we can conclude that V fl V <p> The space S k can be constructed from the elementary permutations. Theorem 7 Every permutation 2 S k can be written as the composition of elementary permutations. Proof: See Munkres <ref> [1] </ref> page 227. 2 Definition 7 Let 2 S k . Consider the set of all pairs of integers i; j from the set f1; : : : ; kg for which i &lt; j and (i) &gt; (j). Each such pair is called an inversion in . <p> If p 6= q, and if t is the permutation that exchanges p and q and leaves all other integers fixed, then sgn (t ) = 1 Proof: See Munkres <ref> [1] </ref> page 228. 2 2.3.2 Alternating Tensors We are now ready to define alternating tensors. Definition 8 Let f be an arbitrary k-tensor on V . <p> Proof: See Munkres <ref> [1] </ref> page 231. 2 Theorem 10 Let a 1 ; : : : ; a n be a basis for V . Let I = (i 1 ; : : : ; i k ) 2 f1; 2; : : : ; ng k ascending k-tuple. <p> The tensors I also satisfy the formula I = 2S k 13 Proof: In Munkres <ref> [1] </ref> pages 232-33. The tensors I are called elementary alternating k-tensors on V corresponding to the basis a 1 ; : : : ; a n for V . <p> Then 1. T fl is linear. 2. T fl (f g) = T fl f T fl g. 3. If S : W ! X is linear, then (S ffi T ) fl f = T fl (S fl f ). 21 Proof: See Munkres <ref> [1] </ref> page 225. 2 The following theorem ensures us that the pull back of an alternating tensor is alternating. Theorem 21 Let T : V ! W be a linear transformation. <p> Theorem 21 Let T : V ! W be a linear transformation. If f is an alternating tensor on W then T fl f is an alternating tensor on V , and T fl (f ^ g) = T fl f ^ T fl g Proof: See Munkres <ref> [1] </ref> page 234. 2 2.5 Contravariant Tensors Up to this point, all the tensors which we have worked with have been defined as multilinear functions over the vector space V . <p> We first review some basic facts from differential geometry. The reader may wish to consult numerous books on the subject such as <ref> [6, 7, 1] </ref>. 3.1 Differentiable Manifolds A manifold is simply a space which locally looks like R n . Definition 23 A manifold M of dimension n is a metric space 3 which is locally homeomorphic to R n . <p> Proof: See Munkres <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 This may be generalized to R n , with vector fields isomorphic to 1-forms and (n-1) forms and scalar fields isomorphic to 0-forms and n-forms. <p> This theorem, however, is a substantial topic in its own right and the reader is referred to treatments by Munkres <ref> [1] </ref> or Spivak [2]. 3.6 Closed and Exact Forms The d-operator may be used to define two classes of forms of particular interest. Definition 29 A k-form ! 2 k (M ) is said to be closed if d! 0. <p> u 1 ; : : : ; u s in some neighborhood U with 2r + s + 1 = dimM such that ff = dz + 2 i=1 and therefore dz = 2 i=1 Given any two points p; q 2 U we must find integral curves c : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! U with c (0) = p and c (1) = q. Without loss of generality we can assume z (p) = x i (p) = y i (p) = u i (p) = 0.

Reference-contexts: Skew-commutativity 1 , g ^ f = (1) kl Proof: Properties (2), (3) and (4) follow directly from the definitions of the alternating operator and the tensor product. Associativity, property (1), requires a few more manipulations (see Spivak <ref> [2] </ref> pages 80-81). 2 Example: Let f (x) 2 fl 1 (V fl ) and g (y; z) 2 fl 2 (V fl ). <p> This theorem, however, is a substantial topic in its own right and the reader is referred to treatments by Munkres [1] or Spivak <ref> [2] </ref>. 3.6 Closed and Exact Forms The d-operator may be used to define two classes of forms of particular interest. Definition 29 A k-form ! 2 k (M ) is said to be closed if d! 0. <p> The submanifold N is called the integral manifold of the distribution . The following theorem, provides us with a condition under which a distribution is integrable. Theorem 31 (Frobenius Theorem for distributions) A distribution (x) is integrable if and only if it is involutive. Proof: See Spivak <ref> [2] </ref> pages 2. In a construction similar to the one described above, one may assign to each point of the manifold a number of 1-forms. The span of these 1-forms will be, at each point, a subspace of the cotangent space T fl p M .

Reference-contexts: Then we have 1. Bilinearity (av + bw):g = a (v:g) + b (w:g) 2. v:(f ^ r) = (v:f ) + (1) m f ^ (v:g) Proof: See Yang <ref> [3] </ref> page 12. 2 The next result illustrates a useful property of the interior product. Theorem 18 Let a 1 ; : : : ; a n be a basis for V .

We will denote this set as I 2 .

Reference-contexts: Let r be the smallest integer such that () r+1 ^ ! 1 ^ : : : ^ ! s = 0 Then the retracting space C (I ) is of dimension 2r + s. 29 Proof: See <ref> [5] </ref> pages 11-12. 2 3 Differential Geometry and Forms The multilinear algebra presented in the previous section can be applied to the tangent space of a differentiable manifold. We first review some basic facts from differential geometry. <p> Then in a neighborhood of x there exist functions h i with 1 i s such that I = fff 1 ; : : : ; ff s g = fdh 1 ; : : : ; dh s g Proof: See <ref> [5] </ref> pages 27-29. 2 For more general exterior differential systems we have the following integrability results. Theorem 35 If the Cauchy characteristic distribution of I has constant dimension r in a neighborhood, then it is integrable. Proof: See [5] page 31. 2 Theorem 36 Let I be a differential ideal whose <p> fdh 1 ; : : : ; dh s g Proof: See <ref> [5] </ref> pages 27-29. 2 For more general exterior differential systems we have the following integrability results. Theorem 35 If the Cauchy characteristic distribution of I has constant dimension r in a neighborhood, then it is integrable. Proof: See [5] page 31. 2 Theorem 36 Let I be a differential ideal whose retracting space has a constant dimension n r. <p> There is a neighborhood in which there are coordinates y 1 ; : : : ; y n such that I has a set of generators which are forms in y 1 ; : : : ; y nr . Proof: See <ref> [5] </ref> page 31-33. 2 4.4 Derived flags If the algebraic ideal generated by a Pfaffian system does not satisfy the Frobenius conditions, then it is not a differential ideal. However, there may be a piece of the algebraic ideal which is also a differential ideal.

Definition 23 A manifold M of dimension n is a metric space 3 which is locally homeomorphic to R n . <p> Then T p M is an n-dimensional vector space and if (U; x) is a local chart around p then the tangent vectors @ @ form a basis for T p M .
