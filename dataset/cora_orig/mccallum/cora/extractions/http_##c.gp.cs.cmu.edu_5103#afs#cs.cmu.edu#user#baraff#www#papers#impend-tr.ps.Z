Reference-contexts: The first two formulations characterize not only the direction of the initial acceleration, but the magnitude as well. The first formulation for the acceleration of rigid bodies with contact constraints has appeared several times in the literature <ref> [5, 6, 9, 4, 1] </ref>. This formulation expresses the acceleration of each body as a function of the net force and torque acting on each body.

Reference-contexts: We will assume that the motion constraints can be expressed by a finite number of constraint inequalities in the form of equation (7) or (8), all of which must be satisfied. (Palmer [11] and Baraff <ref> [2] </ref> contain further discussion on this issue.) That is, we consider systems whose motion constraints are expressed in terms of m contact points between the bodies.

Reference-contexts: If the matrix JM 1 J T is positive definite then is unique. Otherwise JM 1 J T is positive semidefinite (since M and thus M 1 is positive definite), and a solution exists for although it may not be unique. However, Cottle <ref> [3] </ref> has shown that if 1 and 2 are solutions to equation (20) then JM 1 J T 1 = JM 1 J T 2 (21) which implies JM 1 J T ( 1 2 ) = 0: (22) Multiplying both sides of this equation by ( 1 2 ) T

Reference-contexts: The contact forces can be expressed in terms of the solution to a convex quadratic programming problem. Solving convex quadratic programs is a polynomial-time problem <ref> [7] </ref>. The second formulation is an application of Gauss' principle of least constraint to the collection of rigid bodies. Gauss' principle expresses the acceleration of systems with holonomic motion constraints as the solution to a minimization problem.

Reference-contexts: Since Z is a quadratic function of a, and M is positive definite, problem (39) is a convex quadratic programming problem with a unique solution a. The first-order optimality conditions, or KKT conditions <ref> [10] </ref>, for a constrained optimization problem are both necessary and sufficient when applied to a convex quadratic programming problem.
