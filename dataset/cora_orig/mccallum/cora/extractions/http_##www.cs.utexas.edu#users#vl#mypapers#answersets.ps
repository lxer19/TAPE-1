Abstract: Languages of declarative logic programming differ from other modal nonmonotonic formalisms by lack of syntactic uniformity. For instance, negation as failure can be used in the body of a rule, but not in the head; in disjunctive programs, disjunction is used in the head of a rule, but not in the body; in extended programs, negation as failure can be used on top of classical negation, but not the other way around. We argue that this lack of uniformity should not be viewed as a distinguishing feature of logic programming in general. As a starting point, we take a translation from the language of disjunctive programs with negation as failure and classical negation into MBNF|the logic of minimal belief and negation as failure. A class of theories based on this logic is defined, theories with protected literals, which is syntactically uniform and contains the translations of all programs. We show that theories with protected literals have a semantics similar to the answer set semantics used in logic programming, and investigate the expressiveness of these theories.

Reference-contexts: Much work has been done on alternative query evaluation methods, such as the "magic set" method of <ref> [ Bancilhon et al., 1986 ] </ref> , which may produce an answer when Pro-log would not terminate. The development of better query evaluation procedures in logic programming is similar to the development of more powerful theorem provers for other kinds of nonmonotonic formalisms.

Reference-contexts: At this stage, we restrict our attention to the propositional case. The semantics of rules (3) is defined in <ref> [ Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1991 ] </ref> in terms of "answer sets." An answer set of a program is a set of literals. <p> The theories fnot p Bpg, f:not pg and fnot Tg have no answer sets; the only answer set of fnot Fg is fTg. For a theory corresponding to a set of disjunctive rules (3), this definition is essentially equivalent to the one given in <ref> [ Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1991 ] </ref> ; the only difference is that an answer set as defined here includes T, and, if it is inconsistent, also F. <p> Theorem 4. If the axioms of a PL-theory contain no positive occurrences of not , then it cannot have two answer sets of which one is a proper subset of the other. This is a generalization of Lemma 1 from <ref> [ Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1991 ] </ref> . It is similar to the minimality of extensions property in default logic ( [ Reiter, 1980 ] , Theorem 2.4). Corollary. <p> Corollary. If the axioms of a PL-theory T contain no positive occurrences of not , and Lit is an answer set of T , then T has no other answer sets. This is a generalization of Proposition 1 from <ref> [ Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1991 ] </ref> . It is similar to Corollary 2.3 from [ Reiter, 1980 ] . Using Theorem 4, we can show that a PL-theory may have a combination of answer sets that would be impossible without positive occurrences of not in the axioms.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, general logic programs can be viewed as a special case of autoepistemic theories <ref> [ Gelfond, 1987 ] </ref> . These ideas have a profound significance for the theory of knowledge representation. They show that representing knowledge in declarative logic programming is very similar to representing knowledge in default logic or in modal nonmonotonic logics.
