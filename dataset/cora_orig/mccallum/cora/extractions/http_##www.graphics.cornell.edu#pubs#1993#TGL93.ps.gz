Abstract: We introduce a new approach for the computation of view-independent solutions to the diffuse global illumination problem in polyhedral environments. The approach combines ideas from hierarchical radiosity and discontinuity meshing to yield solutions that are accurate both numerically and visually. First, we describe a modified hierarchical radiosity algorithm that uses a discontinuity-driven subdivision strategy to achieve better numerical accuracy and faster convergence. Second, we present a new algorithm based on discontinuity meshing that uses the hierarchical solution to reconstruct an object-space approximation to the radiance function that is visually accurate. Our results show significant improvements over both hierarchical radiosity and discontinuity meshing algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Radiosity systems are seldom user-friendly and require massive user intervention: typically, a time consuming trial-and-error process is required to produce an image that looks right. Baum et al. <ref> [1] </ref> and Haines [12] provide good discussions of the various pitfalls of radiosity. In this paper we present a new radiosity method, which comes closer to satisfying our goals. The new method combines two recently developed approaches: hierarchical radiosity [14] and discontinuity meshing [15, 18]. <p> This leads to solutions which are both numerically and visually more accurate. Another advantage is that higher order elements can be used much more effectively in conjunction with discontinuity meshes [16]. Several algorithms have been described that use the idea of discontinuity meshing to various extents <ref> [1, 3, 6, 15] </ref>. Recently, a progressive radiosity DM algorithm was described by the authors [18]. The meshing in this algorithm is automatic. Using analytical visibility and form factor computations followed by quadratic interpolation it has produced radiosity solutions of impressive visual accuracy. <p> The Delaunay triangulation (DT) of a point set maximizes the minimum angle over all possible triangulations of that set and has a number of other desirable properties [2]. These properties are important because they result in well-shaped elements that yield more accurate approximations and reduce visual artifacts during display <ref> [1] </ref>. CDT takes as input a point set and a set of edges connecting some of the points, and creates a triangulation of the points that is constrained to include all the input edges. CDT preserves the properties of DT over all the constrained triangulations.

An alternative easy-to-implement algorithm is described in the excellent survey by Bern and Eppstein <ref> [2] </ref>. For each input polygon we provide the CDT routine with all of its boundary edges and discontinuity segments. The corners of all the leaf nodes in the corresponding hierarchy are given as well.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the local pass essentially performs an additional light gathering operation over the environment. However, instead of gathering to the nodes in the hierarchy, we gather to the elements of the discontinuity mesh.

Reference-contexts: When a discontinuity curve crosses a mesh element, the approximation to the radiance function over that element becomes less accurate. The resulting errors usually correspond to the most visually distracting artifacts in radiosity images. The traditional radiosity approach uses adaptive subdivision <ref> [8] </ref> to reduce these errors, however there are several problems with this approach. First, the user must specify an initial mesh that is sufficiently dense, or features will be lost.

Except for D 0 edges, these values are shared between adjacent faces (our CDT algorithm constructs a topological data structure suitable for such information sharing <ref> [11] </ref>.) The six values are then interpolated by a quadratic bivariate polynomial. This scheme yields a C 0 piecewise quadratic interpolant to the radiance on each polygon.

Hierarchical radiosity (HR) <ref> [14] </ref> overcomes these problems by decomposing the matrix of interactions into O (n) blocks, for a given accuracy. These blocks correspond to interactions of roughly equal magnitude, and the same computational effort is required for computing each block. HR operates by constructing a hierarchical subdivision of each input surface. <p> This creates a starting point for the global pass, which proceeds to refine these links as needed. We test visibility between two polygons using a combination of shaft-culling [13] and the ray-tracing algorithm that Hanrahan et al. <ref> [14] </ref> used. The discontinuity location stage computes the location of all the D 0 discontinuities, since these are typically responsible for the most severe errors (both numerically and visually.) In most environments the direct illumination by primary light sources is responsible for the most perceptible illumination details.

Now our goal is to convert this solution into a form more suited for producing visually accurate images. To that end, we need to locally refine the radiance approximation on each polygon. Our experience with discontinuity meshing <ref> [18] </ref> has shown that reproducing the discontinuities in the radiance function, while maintaining a smooth approximation elsewhere is key to achieving visual accuracy, especially when multiple views of the same solution are to be rendered. Therefore, we construct a discontinuity mesh containing the precomputed primary discontinuities for each polygon. <p> This scheme yields a C 0 piecewise quadratic interpolant to the radiance on each polygon. This interpolant was found to provide approximations that look smoother and are less prone to Mach bands than the traditional piecewise linear interpolation <ref> [18] </ref>. Salesin et al.

To obtain a radiance value at a point x we use the information available to us from the hierarchical solution. <p> The next logical step is to recompute both the form factor and the visibility of each source as seen from x.

As a result, the error bound shrinks further: E rs (x) r F xs V xs B s B s (4) However, the computation becomes more expensive. Method D. To reduce the cost, we can recompute the visibility for links to primary light sources only. <p> Furthermore, the total computation time was almost twice as long for the HR solution. We attempted to perform a similar comparison with our progres sive DM algorithm <ref> [18] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Recently, a progressive radiosity DM algorithm was described by the authors [18]. The meshing in this algorithm is automatic. Using analytical visibility and form factor computations followed by quadratic interpolation it has produced radiosity solutions of impressive visual accuracy. This algorithm was also shown to be numerically accurate <ref> [24] </ref>. However, this method is too expensive for computing converged solutions of complex environment and only offers limited user control in trading off speed for accuracy. <p> However, the resulting discontinuities always lie within penumbra regions, and never define the outer boundaries of a shadow. For these reasons, we excluded EEE events from our current implementation. We described the discontinuity location algorithm in a previous paper [18]. Tampieri <ref> [24] </ref> provides a more detailed description of this algorithm. Heckbert [15] and Teller [25] describe alternative algorithms for locating discontinuities.

Tampieri [24] provides a more detailed description of this algorithm. Heckbert [15] and Teller <ref> [25] </ref> describe alternative algorithms for locating discontinuities. Teller's algorithm is the only one capable of handling EEE events. 5 THE GLOBAL PASS In order to understand how the accuracy of HR can be improved, we must examine its sources of error.

Reference-contexts: All timings are for execution on an HP 9000/720 workstation. Teller and Hanrahan <ref> [26] </ref>. We need to be able to compute tight bounds on the visibility between two partially occluded polygons. This would improve the efficiency of the global pass by eliminating unnecessary subdivision in penumbral areas. Choice of sources.

Reference-contexts: As a result of the properties of the CDT, most of the triangles are well shaped unless the hierarchy is very coarse. The radiance across each triangle is approximated using a standard quadratic element commonly used in finite element methods <ref> [27] </ref>. Six radiance values are computed for each element: three at the vertices, and three at the edge midpoints.
