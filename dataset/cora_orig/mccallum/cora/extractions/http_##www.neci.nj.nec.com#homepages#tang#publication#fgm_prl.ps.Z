Abstract: To examine the properties of the frustrated XY model at an incommensurate field we have examined a sequence of magnetic filling factors f which approach the irrational value of one minus the golden mean. At all f studied, the system undergoes a finite-temperature weak first-order transition involving the freezing out of Ising-like domain walls. As one approaches incommensurability, the low temperature phase of the system changes from the staircase states found by Halsey [8] to a striped phase consisting of a superlattice of parallel shift (Pott's-like) domain walls. Our results suggest that the glassy effects previously reported for this model are an artifact of the boundary conditions and dynamics that were used. The irrationality of a parameter f , characterizing the frustration of a physical system can have a profound and often very surprising effect. In the frustrated XY model, the interplay of two length scales the mean separation of vortices induced by the frustration f and the period of the underlying lattice gives rise to a wide variety of interesting physical phenomena [1]. Halsey has proposed [2], based on numerical evidence, that in the limit 5)=2 this model displays a glass transition to a superconducting frozen disordered vortex state. If this were true, it would make the frustrated X Y model at f fl a structural glass, a glassy system which possess no intrinsic random disorder, something of great current interest. Experiments on superconducting arrays [3], an experimental realization of this model, find evidence for a finite temperature transition for this irrational f fl . However, recent simulations by Granato [4] showed results consistent with a glass transition at zero temperature, and those by Kim and Lee [5] showed dynamics resembling that of a supercooled liquid near the transition temperature found by Halsey. Naively, one might have expected this system to behave in a similar manner to the commensurate-incommensurate (C-I) behavior seen in the discrete sine-Gordan model [6]. While this is the case for the frustrated XY model in a 1D ladder geometry [7], global screening currents are required in order to maintain a vortex density different from the frustration f . Since in 2D this costs an energy logarithmic in the size of the system, fixed density of vortices equal to f is always observed, destroying the devil's staircase structure of the phase diagram (in the density-f plane). Since previous studies of C-I transitions have been done under conditions of fixed chemical potential (varying density) rather than fixed density, it is unknown what effect this additional global constraint will have. To study the system near incommensurability we examine a sequence of states, f = 3=8, 5=13, 8=21, 13=34, 21=55, 34=89 which approaches the quadratic irrational value of f fl = (3 p 5)=2. We examine ground state properties and low energy excitations using a numerical constrained optimization to minimize the energy. We correlate these states to those found with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of systems with soft boundary conditions. When we relax the constraint of fixed periodicity, allowing the system to find it's own natural period, we find that the system undergoes a finite temperature (not approaching zero) phase transition to an ordered state. As one goes down this sequence towards f fl we find that at f = 5=13 the ground state changes from a staircase state [8,9] to a striped phase, similar to those found in commensurate-incommensurate transitions. We therefore conclude that the "glassy" behavior seen by previous workers is an artifact of energy barriers in their particular dynamics and boundary conditions. The Hamiltonian of the frustrated XY model is It is, in general, quite hard to study a system near incommensurability. For numerical work this is due to the large system sizes required; for f = p=q a system of at least q fi q, and possibly much larger [10], is required, and by definition q ! 1 for incommensurate f . The ground states of the Hamiltonian (1) will be among the solutions of an irrational f fl = (3
