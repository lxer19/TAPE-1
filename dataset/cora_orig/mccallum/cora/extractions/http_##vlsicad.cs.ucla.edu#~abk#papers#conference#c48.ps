Abstract: There has been increased research interest in systems composed of multiple autonomous mobile robots exhibiting collective behavior. Groups of mobile robots are constructed, with an aim to studying such issues as group architecture, resource conflict, origin of cooperation, learning, and geometric problems. As yet, few applications of collective robotics have been reported, and supporting theory is still in its formative stages. In this paper, we give a critical survey of existing works and discuss open problems in this field, emphasizing the various theoretical issues that arise in the study of cooperative robotics. We describe the intellectual heritages that have guided early research, as well as possible additions to the set of existing motivations.

Grossman [Gro88] classifies instances of the traffic control problem into three types: (i) restricted roads, (ii) multiple possible roads with robots selecting autonomously between them, and (iii) multiple possible roads with centralized traffic control.

Reference-contexts: In foraging, a group of robots must pick up objects scattered in the environment; this is evocative of toxic waste cleanup, harvesting, search and rescue, etc. The foraging task is one of the canonical testbeds for cooperative robotics <ref> [Ste90, Ark92, GD92, LB92, DF93, AH93, Mat94a, BHD94] </ref>. 5 A wide variety of techniques have been proposed, ranging from simple stigmergy 6 [BHD94] to more complex algorithms in which robots form chains along which objects are passed to the goal [DF93]. <p> Currently, the dominant paradigm is the decentralized approach. 11 The behavior of decentralized systems is often described using such terms as emergence and self organization. 12 It is widely claimed that decentralized architectures (e.g., <ref> [BHD94, Ark92, Ste94, Mat94a] </ref>) have several inherent advantages over centralized architectures, including fault tolerance, natural exploitation of parallelism, reliability, and scalability. 2.1.2 Differentiation We define a group of robots to be homogeneous if the capabilities of the individual robots are identical, and heterogeneous otherwise. <p> Interaction via environment The simplest, most limited type of interaction occurs when the environment itself is the communication medium (in effect, a shared memory), and there is no explicit communication or interaction between agents. Systems that depend on this form of interaction include <ref> [GD92, BHD94, Ark92, Ste90, TK93, Tun94, SSH94] </ref>. Interaction via sensing Corresponding to arms-length relationships in organization theory [Hew93], this refers to local interactions that occur between agents as a result of agents sensing one another, but without explicit communication.

Reference-contexts: In the late 1980's, the robotics research community became very active in cooperative robotics, beginning with projects such as ACTRESS [AMI89], CE-BOT [FN87], GOFER [CCL + 90], SWARM <ref> [Ben88] </ref> and the work at Brussels [Ste90]. <p> Related to the Formation problem is the pattern generation problem in Cellular Robotic Systems. A Cellular Robotic System (CRS) is a multiple-robot system which can encode information as patterns of its own structural units <ref> [Ben88] </ref>. Typically, one- or two-dimensional grids constitute the workspace, and sensing of neighboring cells is the only input. Within these constraints, a set of rules is devised and applied to all agents; a standard result is to show in simulation that convergence to some spatial pattern is guaranteed. <p> A more general, biological 42 metaphor that is often used in cooperative robotics is the concept of a self-organizing sys tem [NP77, Yat87]. 43 Representative work that is based on this concept includes [WB88, Ste90, HB91, HB92, BH92]. Self-organization in multi-cellular biological systems has been an inspiration for <ref> [Ben88, EZ88, HW88, GDMO92] </ref>. Hierarchical organization of biological multi-cellular organisms (i.e., from cellular to tissue to organism level) has been used as a guiding metaphor for cellular robotics in the CE-BOT project [FN87]. <p> Distributed Systems A multiple-robot system is in fact a special case of a distributed computing system. Thus, the field of distributed systems is a natural source of ideas and solutions. <ref> [Ben88] </ref> describes cellular robotics as belonging to the general field of distributed computing.

Reference-contexts: Coordination and interactions of multiple intelligent agents have been actively studied in the field of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) since the early 1970's <ref> [BG88] </ref>, but the DAI field concerned itself mainly with problems involving software agents. In the late 1980's, the robotics research community became very active in cooperative robotics, beginning with projects such as ACTRESS [AMI89], CE-BOT [FN87], GOFER [CCL + 90], SWARM [Ben88] and the work at Brussels [Ste90]. <p> Unlike eusocial behavior, cooperative behavior is not motivated by innate behavior, but by an intentional desire to cooperate in order to maximize individual utility. Inspired by economics and game-theoretic approaches, <ref> [GGR86, RG85, BG88, RZ94] </ref> and others have studied the emergence of cooperation in selfish rational agents in the field of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI). 2.4 Learning Finding the correct values for control parameters that lead to a desired cooperative behavior can be a difficult, time-consuming task for a human designer. <p> Distributed Artificial Intelligence The field of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) concerns itself with the study of distributed systems of intelligent agents. As such, this field is highly relevant to cooperative robotics. Bond and Gasser <ref> [BG88] </ref> define DAI as the subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with con-currency in AI computations, at many levels.

Reference-contexts: Webster's dictionary [MW63] defines cooperate as to associate with another or others for mutual, often economic, benefit. Explicit definitions of cooperation in the robotics literature, while surprisingly sparse, include: (a) joint collaborative behavior that is directed toward some goal in which there is a common interest or reward <ref> [BG91] </ref>; (b) a form of interaction, usually based on communication [Mat94a]; and (c) [joining] together for doing something that creates a progressive result such as increasing performance or saving time [PY90] These definitions show the wide range of possible motivating perspectives.

The robots are able to sense neighboringcells and communicate with other robots via a signboard mechanism. Protocols are presented for creating different patterns (see also [EZ88]). <p> Works based on this insect-colony analogy include <ref> [Mat94a, BHD94, SB93, DA93, JB94] </ref>. The pattern generation of CRS's can also be considered as bottom-up (see Section 2.5), since each robot is designed as a very simple agent which follows a set of prespecified rules.

Reference-contexts: Due to the difficulties encountered when working with real robots (such as those outlined above), much of collective robotics has been studied exclusively in simulation. Some researchers have argued (cf. <ref> [Bro91] </ref>) that by ignoring most of the difficulties associated with perception and actuation, simulations ignore the most difficult problems of robotics.

Reference-contexts: Thus, robots are often restricted to prescribed paths or roads, with rules (much like traffic laws in the human world) and communications used to avoid collision and deadlock [CCL + 90, AHE + 91].

McFarland [McF94] distinguishes between two significantly different types of group behaviors that are found in 21 Analysis in <ref> [Gro88] </ref> shows that restricted roads are highly suboptimal, and that the autonomous road choice coupled with a greedy policy for escaping blocked situations is far more effective. 22 In [KNT92], robots follow preplanned paths and use rules for collision avoidance.

DPS involves three possibly overlapping phases: (i) problem decomposition (task allocation), (ii) subproblem solution, and (iii) solution synthesis. 39 The ACTOR formalism <ref> [Hew77] </ref> is a significant computational model, developed in DAI, which maps naturally to parallel computation. 40 One important assumption in DPS is that the agents are predisposed to cooperate.

Reference-contexts: Explicit definitions of cooperation in the robotics literature, while surprisingly sparse, include: (a) joint collaborative behavior that is directed toward some goal in which there is a common interest or reward [BG91]; (b) a form of interaction, usually based on communication <ref> [Mat94a] </ref>; and (c) [joining] together for doing something that creates a progressive result such as increasing performance or saving time [PY90] These definitions show the wide range of possible motivating perspectives. <p> This early research was done primarily in simulation; 4 thus, several more recent works (cf. [KZ92, Mat92, Par92]) are significant for their emphasis on the actual physical implementation of cooperative robotic systems. 1 This is a characterizationof the definitionitself; the leadingmotivationin <ref> [Mat94a] </ref> was actually the social nature of intelligence and its manifestation in group behaviors. 2 In this work, we do not discuss the competitive subclass of collective behavior, which includes pursuit-evasion [Rey94, MC94] and one-on-one competitive games [AUN + 94]. <p> In foraging, a group of robots must pick up objects scattered in the environment; this is evocative of toxic waste cleanup, harvesting, search and rescue, etc. The foraging task is one of the canonical testbeds for cooperative robotics <ref> [Ste90, Ark92, GD92, LB92, DF93, AH93, Mat94a, BHD94] </ref>. 5 A wide variety of techniques have been proposed, ranging from simple stigmergy 6 [BHD94] to more complex algorithms in which robots form chains along which objects are passed to the goal [DF93]. <p> that are likely to be very important to cooperative robotics are beyond the scope of this paper. 8 Note that certain basic robot interactions are not task-performing interactions per se, but are rather basic primitives upon which task-performinginteractions can be built (e.g., following ([Con87, DJR94] and many others) or flocking <ref> [Rey87, Mat94a] </ref>). It might be argued that these interactions entail control and coordination tasks rather than cooperation tasks, but our treatment does not make such a distinction. 9 We do not discuss instances where cooperation has been explicitly engineered into the robots' behavior since this is the default approach. <p> Currently, the dominant paradigm is the decentralized approach. 11 The behavior of decentralized systems is often described using such terms as emergence and self organization. 12 It is widely claimed that decentralized architectures (e.g., <ref> [BHD94, Ark92, Ste94, Mat94a] </ref>) have several inherent advantages over centralized architectures, including fault tolerance, natural exploitation of parallelism, reliability, and scalability. 2.1.2 Differentiation We define a group of robots to be homogeneous if the capabilities of the individual robots are identical, and heterogeneous otherwise. <p> The ALLIANCE/L-ALLIANCE architecture has been implemented both on real robots and in simulation, and has been successfully demonstrated for tasks including box-pushing, puck-gathering, marching in formation, and simulations of hazardous waste cleanup and janitorial service. Behavior-Based Cooperative Behavior Mataric <ref> [Mat94a] </ref> proposes a behavior-based architecture for the synthesis of collective behaviors such as flocking, foraging, and docking based on the direct and temporal composition of primitive basic behaviors (safe-wandering, following, aggregation, dispersion, homing). A method for automatically constructing composite behaviors based on reinforcement learning is also proposed. <p> Recently, [McF94, Ste94] have laid the initial groundwork to address the problem of emergent cooperation in an ecological system inhabited by actual mobile robots. In this ecosystem, individual robots are selfish, utility-driven agents that must cooperate in order to survive (i.e., maintain some minimal energy level). 24 <ref> [Mat94a, Mat94b] </ref> proposea reformulationof the reinforcementlearningparadigm using higher levels of abstraction (conditions, behaviors, and heterogeneous reward functions and progress estimators instead of states, actions, and reinforcement) to enable robots to learn a composite foraging behavior. [Par94] uses standard reinforcement algorithms to improve the performance of cooperating agents in the L-ALLIANCE architecture <p> An approach taken by some researchers is to use simulations as prototypes for larger-scale studies, and small numbers of real robots as a proof-of-concept demonstration <ref> [Mat94a, Par94] </ref>. <p> Grounded it is still unclear whether it will be feasible to realistically model sophisticated agents in more complex environments, or whether the effort will outweigh the benefits. 35 [Par94], which presents a formalization of motivational behavior in the ALLIANCE architecture, is a notable exception. 36 <ref> [Mat94a] </ref> has suggested parameters such as agent density for estimating interference in a multi-robot system. <p> However, achieving strict criteria of rationality and deliberativeness can often be prohibitively expensive in current robotic systems. Thus, it has been argued that DAI, while suited for unsituated, knowledge-based systems, will not succeed in the domain of cooperative robotics <ref> [Par94, Mat94a] </ref>. 41 Biology Biological analogies and influences abound in the field of cooperative robotics. The majority of existing work in the field has cited biological systems as inspiration or justification. <p> Works based on this insect-colony analogy include <ref> [Mat94a, BHD94, SB93, DA93, JB94] </ref>. The pattern generation of CRS's can also be considered as bottom-up (see Section 2.5), since each robot is designed as a very simple agent which follows a set of prespecified rules.

This cooperative behavior is nec essary for the survival of the individuals in the colonies. 23 On the other hand, <ref> [McF94] </ref> defines cooperative behavior as the social behavior observed in higher animals (vertebrates); cooperation is the result of interactions between selfish agents. Unlike eusocial behavior, cooperative behavior is not motivated by innate behavior, but by an intentional desire to cooperate in order to maximize individual utility. <p> However, we note path planning separately because of its intrinsic geometric flavor as well as its historical importance in the literature. 23 [WD92] studies the evolution of herding behavior in prey agents in a simulated ecology, where there is no a priori drive for cooperation. Recently, <ref> [McF94, Ste94] </ref> have laid the initial groundwork to address the problem of emergent cooperation in an ecological system inhabited by actual mobile robots. <p> On the other hand, some researchers, citing the necessity of working in the real world domain, have chosen to eschew simulations altogether and implement their theories directly on actual robots <ref> [BHD94, McF94, Ste94] </ref>. 34 31 In [WB88], a CRS is characterized as an arbitrary number of robots in a one- or two-dimensionalgrid.

Other works in the box-pushing/object genre manipulation include [WNM94, MHB94, SB93, JB94]. * Foraging. <p> (e.g., to social insect behavior), game-theoretic justifications for cooperation, and concepts of emergence. 10 One important mechanism in generating cooperation,namely, task decomposition and allocation, is not considered a research axis since (i) very few works in cooperative robotics have centered on task decomposition and allocation (with the notable exception of <ref> [Par94] </ref>), (ii) cooperative robot tasks (foraging, box-pushing) in the literature are simple enough that decomposition and allocation are not required in the solution, and (iii) the use of decomposition and allocation depends almost entirely on the group architectures (e.g. whether it is centralized or decentralized). the ability to model other agents. <p> 19 Communications requirements have been studied extensively with respect to the CEBOT architecture, and various methods have been proposed that seek to reduce communication requirements by making individual cells more intelligent (e.g., enabling them to model the behavior of other cells). 20 ALLIANCE/L-ALLIANCE The ALLIANCE architecture was developed by Parker <ref> [Par94] </ref> in order to study cooperation in a heterogeneous, small-to-medium-sized team of largely independent, loosely coupled robots. Robots are assumed able to, with some probability, sense the effects of their own actions and the actions of other agents through perception and explicit broadcast communications. <p> Individual robots are based on a behavior-based controller with an extension for activating behavior sets that accomplish certain tasks. These sets are activated by motivational behaviors whose activations are in turn determined by the robots' awareness of their teammates. L-ALLIANCE <ref> [Par94] </ref> is an extension to the architecture that uses reinforcement learning to adjust the parameters controlling behavior set activation. <p> agents that must cooperate in order to survive (i.e., maintain some minimal energy level). 24 [Mat94a, Mat94b] proposea reformulationof the reinforcementlearningparadigm using higher levels of abstraction (conditions, behaviors, and heterogeneous reward functions and progress estimators instead of states, actions, and reinforcement) to enable robots to learn a composite foraging behavior. <ref> [Par94] </ref> uses standard reinforcement algorithms to improve the performance of cooperating agents in the L-ALLIANCE architecture by having the agents learn how to better estimate the performance of other agents. [SSH94] uses reinforcement learning in a two-robot box-pushing system, and [YS92] applies reinforcement learning to learn a simple, artificial robot language. <p> Solving these problems is quite interesting in terms of distributed algorithms [SS90], balancing between global and local knowledge <ref> [Par94] </ref>, 28 and intrinsic information requirements for a given task. Solutions to Formation and Marching are also useful primitives for larger tasks, e.g., moving a large object by a group of robots [SB93] 29 or distributed sensing [WB88]. <p> An approach taken by some researchers is to use simulations as prototypes for larger-scale studies, and small numbers of real robots as a proof-of-concept demonstration <ref> [Mat94a, Par94] </ref>. <p> Grounded it is still unclear whether it will be feasible to realistically model sophisticated agents in more complex environments, or whether the effort will outweigh the benefits. 35 <ref> [Par94] </ref>, which presents a formalization of motivational behavior in the ALLIANCE architecture, is a notable exception. 36 [Mat94a] has suggested parameters such as agent density for estimating interference in a multi-robot system. <p> However, achieving strict criteria of rationality and deliberativeness can often be prohibitively expensive in current robotic systems. Thus, it has been argued that DAI, while suited for unsituated, knowledge-based systems, will not succeed in the domain of cooperative robotics <ref> [Par94, Mat94a] </ref>. 41 Biology Biological analogies and influences abound in the field of cooperative robotics. The majority of existing work in the field has cited biological systems as inspiration or justification.

Reference-contexts: approaches are superior to centralized approaches, we have not seen any thorough, published experimental comparisons between the major competing paradigms on a particular task. 38 A typical example is moving to formation, which has been solved optimally in the computational geometry literature (it is the geometric matching under isometry problem <ref> [PH92] </ref>), but which is difficult in the distributed context due to issues like synchronization, fault-tolerance, leader election, etc.

Reference-contexts: include: (a) joint collaborative behavior that is directed toward some goal in which there is a common interest or reward [BG91]; (b) a form of interaction, usually based on communication [Mat94a]; and (c) [joining] together for doing something that creates a progressive result such as increasing performance or saving time <ref> [PY90] </ref> These definitions show the wide range of possible motivating perspectives. <p> When individual robots possess unique roads from one point to another, no conflict is possible; when there is global knowledge and centralized control, it is easy to prevent conflict.

Reference-contexts: that are likely to be very important to cooperative robotics are beyond the scope of this paper. 8 Note that certain basic robot interactions are not task-performing interactions per se, but are rather basic primitives upon which task-performinginteractions can be built (e.g., following ([Con87, DJR94] and many others) or flocking <ref> [Rey87, Mat94a] </ref>). It might be argued that these interactions entail control and coordination tasks rather than cooperation tasks, but our treatment does not make such a distinction. 9 We do not discuss instances where cooperation has been explicitly engineered into the robots' behavior since this is the default approach.

Reference-contexts: In the late 1980's, the robotics research community became very active in cooperative robotics, beginning with projects such as ACTRESS [AMI89], CE-BOT [FN87], GOFER [CCL + 90], SWARM [Ben88] and the work at Brussels <ref> [Ste90] </ref>. <p> In foraging, a group of robots must pick up objects scattered in the environment; this is evocative of toxic waste cleanup, harvesting, search and rescue, etc. The foraging task is one of the canonical testbeds for cooperative robotics <ref> [Ste90, Ark92, GD92, LB92, DF93, AH93, Mat94a, BHD94] </ref>. 5 A wide variety of techniques have been proposed, ranging from simple stigmergy 6 [BHD94] to more complex algorithms in which robots form chains along which objects are passed to the goal [DF93]. <p> Interaction via environment The simplest, most limited type of interaction occurs when the environment itself is the communication medium (in effect, a shared memory), and there is no explicit communication or interaction between agents.

Self-organization in multi-cellular biological systems has been an inspiration for [Ben88, EZ88, HW88, GDMO92].

Reference-contexts: Currently, the dominant paradigm is the decentralized approach. 11 The behavior of decentralized systems is often described using such terms as emergence and self organization. 12 It is widely claimed that decentralized architectures (e.g., <ref> [BHD94, Ark92, Ste94, Mat94a] </ref>) have several inherent advantages over centralized architectures, including fault tolerance, natural exploitation of parallelism, reliability, and scalability. 2.1.2 Differentiation We define a group of robots to be homogeneous if the capabilities of the individual robots are identical, and heterogeneous otherwise. <p> However, we note path planning separately because of its intrinsic geometric flavor as well as its historical importance in the literature. 23 [WD92] studies the evolution of herding behavior in prey agents in a simulated ecology, where there is no a priori drive for cooperation. Recently, <ref> [McF94, Ste94] </ref> have laid the initial groundwork to address the problem of emergent cooperation in an ecological system inhabited by actual mobile robots. <p> On the other hand, some researchers, citing the necessity of working in the real world domain, have chosen to eschew simulations altogether and implement their theories directly on actual robots <ref> [BHD94, McF94, Ste94] </ref>. 34 31 In [WB88], a CRS is characterized as an arbitrary number of robots in a one- or two-dimensionalgrid. The robots are able to sense neighboringcells and communicate with other robots via a signboard mechanism. Protocols are presented for creating different patterns (see also [EZ88]).

The Formation problem seems very difficult, e.g., no published work has yet given a distributed circle-forming algorithm that guarantees the robots will actually end up in a circle. 30 We observe that the circle-forming problem, while quite simple, reveals several pitfalls in formulating distributed geometric tasks. <p> On the other hand, some researchers, citing the necessity of working in the real world domain, have chosen to eschew simulations altogether and implement their theories directly on actual robots [BHD94, McF94, Ste94]. 34 31 In <ref> [WB88] </ref>, a CRS is characterized as an arbitrary number of robots in a one- or two-dimensionalgrid. The robots are able to sense neighboringcells and communicate with other robots via a signboard mechanism.

However, we note path planning separately because of its intrinsic geometric flavor as well as its historical importance in the literature. 23 <ref> [WD92] </ref> studies the evolution of herding behavior in prey agents in a simulated ecology, where there is no a priori drive for cooperation. Recently, [McF94, Ste94] have laid the initial groundwork to address the problem of emergent cooperation in an ecological system inhabited by actual mobile robots. <p> Other relevant works in multiagent reinforcement learning (done in simulation, as opposed to the works abovewhich were implemented on actual robots) include [Whi91, Tan93, Lit94]. 25 <ref> [WD92] </ref> uses a genetic algorithm [Gol89] to evolve neural network controllers for simulated prey creatures that learn a herding behavior to help avoid predators.
