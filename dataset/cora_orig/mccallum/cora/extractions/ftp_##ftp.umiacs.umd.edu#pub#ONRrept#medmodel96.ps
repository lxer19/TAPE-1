Reference-contexts: are able to handle full first-order logical theories, or more, may behave unpredictably when given logical statements from a variety of sources with differing purposes. 3 Resolution The main resolution at the Maryland meeting was to recommend the relational subset of OQL, the query language proposed by the ODMG committee, <ref> [Cattell96] </ref>, as the core language. This sublanguage has a simple syntax close to that of SQL and implements the desired "core semantics" that of the relational algebra.

Reference-contexts: discussed: * Exchange format for the data. * Communication protocol, including session con trol. 2.3 Alternative Approaches Since the primary reason for wanting a core language is to facilitate the exchange of data, the immediate question is why not adopt one of the many existing standard data formats, e.g., ASN.1 <ref> [ISO1987] </ref>, that have been developed for precisely this purpose. A simple request language would be needed to specify requests for data in this format. <p> Thus, some convention about the representation of these standard types needs to be adopted, for example, a standard data format of <ref> [ISO1987] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: At a minimum, such descriptions should be human-understandable, but it is interesting to speculate that the description could be made machine-understandable, to be used for example, by the query-optimizer/translator of another component. We observed at the workshop that OLE-DB, the "tabular" database interface extensions to OLE COM <ref> [Microsoft1994, Microsoft1996] </ref>, appears to be heading in this direction. 2 Discussion The Maryland workshop focussed on several issues and options.
