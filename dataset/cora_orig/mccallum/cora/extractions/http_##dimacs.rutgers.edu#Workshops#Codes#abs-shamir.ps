Abstract: A strongly sequential lossless compression scheme with fixed per-letter computational complexity is presented for memoryless sources with abruptly changing statistics. It achieves redundancy of O (log N=N) when the transitions in the statistics are

Each state is assigned a weight for x n , which is updated recursively, and Q (x n ) is the sum of the weights at time n. A good choice of state transition weights can achieve the PSMS lower bound.
