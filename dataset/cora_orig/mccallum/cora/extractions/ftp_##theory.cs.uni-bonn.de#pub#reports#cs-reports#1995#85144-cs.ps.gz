Abstract: We extend the lower bounds on the depth of algebraic decision trees to the case of randomized algebraic decision trees (with two-sided error) for languages being finite unions of hyperplanes and the intersections of halfspaces. As an application, among other things, we derive, for the first time, (n 2 ) randomized lower bound for the knapsack problem (which was previously only known for deterministic algebraic decision trees). x Dept. of Computer Science, University of Bonn, 53117 Bonn.

Reference-contexts: Several algebraic and topological methods which were introduced in proving lower bounds for deterministic algebraic decision trees (cf. [SY82], <ref> [B83] </ref>, [BLY92], [GKV95], [Y94]), with the exception of [BKL93], and [GK93], were not yielding lower bounds for the case of randomized decision trees. <p> instead of " 1 ; : : : ; " n where " (0) `+1 is "considerably smaller" than " (0) But then one should specify, what does it mean "considerably smaller", and it is more convenient to use infinitesimals. 3 Randomized Computation Trees: Local Case Recall (see, e. g., <ref> [B83] </ref>) that a (deterministic) computation tree (CT) contains the nodes of two types: the computation nodes and the branching query ones. At the computation node one can compute a new polynomial by either addition or multiplication of two previously (on the path of the tree) computed polynomials. <p> E (+) (0) Remark For d-degree randomized decision tree one can get the lower bound 1 2d n following the proof of the theorem 1 and replacing the reference to lemma 1 by the remark after lemma 1. 4 Randomized Decision Trees: Global Case and Applications Recall (see e. g. <ref> [B83] </ref>) that to every node of a d-decision tree (d - DT) a testing polynomial of degree at most d is assigned. Similar as in the section 1 one defines a randomized d-decision tree (d - RDT), see e. g. [M85a].

Our paper provides the first lower bounds on the depth of randomized algebraic decision trees in the case of the languages being finite unions of hyperplanes as well as intersections of halfspaces. <p> We say that T tests a (semialgebraic) set S ae IR n if T gives the correct answer for any point (x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) 2 IR n with the probability &gt; 2 3 (cf. <ref> [M85a] </ref>). <p> Similar as in the section 1 one defines a randomized d-decision tree (d - RDT), see e. g. <ref> [M85a] </ref>. Let H 1 ; : : : ; H m ae IR n be hyperplanes. We consider recognizing by d - RDT of one of two following sets; either the complement to the arrangement S = IR n n S 1im H i (cf.

[GKV95]), although the main result could be extended to more general sets constructed by means of the hyperplanes. <p> This shows that the results of this section ascertained for RDT can not be directly extended to RCT. Under a k-face L k of S (cf <ref> [M85a] </ref>) we mean k-dimensional plane of the form "H i for a certain subset I ae f1; : : : ; mg.

As a consequence we get (n 2 ) lower bound for the depth of d - RDT, recognizing the knapsack (cf. <ref> [M85a] </ref>), when d = const. Similarly, for the distinctness problem f (x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) : x i 6= x j ; i 6= jg 2 IR n we get (n log n) lower bound (cf.
