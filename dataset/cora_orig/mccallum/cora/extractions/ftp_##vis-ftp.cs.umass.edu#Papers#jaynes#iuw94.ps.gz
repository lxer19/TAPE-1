Reference-contexts: The low level features that are originally extracted are used to form collated features. 3.1 Straight Lines Straight lines are extracted using two different methods. The primary, bottom-up method for extracting low level straight line features is the Boldt algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>. This algorithm hierarchically groups edgels into progressively longer line segments based on proximity and collinearity constraints. Figure 2 shows the Boldt lines extracted from a typical aerial urban scene. Boldt lines are assigned a certainty measure that is calculated during their extraction. <p> Boldt lines are assigned a certainty measure that is calculated during their extraction. The line certainty depends primarily on the contrast of the edge and on the least-squares residual error of the line fit to the grouped edges. For a detailed description of Boldt line certainty, see <ref> [1] </ref>. Another line detection scheme is used for top-down grouping verification. These local lines are extracted when possible groupings between features are being considered. This approach focuses the power of perceptual grouping to a predictive task and avoids reliance on single, globally extracted features.

Reference-contexts: CDA-8922572 cessful system will discover rooftops that can be used for further image understanding tasks. 2 Task Driven Organization The power of perceptual organization for the extraction of structure in natural scenes is well know. <ref> [?, 4, 6] </ref> In our approach, low level features are perceptually grouped to form collated features which are then used to hypothesize the final groupings. However, besides this bottom-up approach, each level of the hierarchy may search for features in a task driven, top-down manner.

Reference-contexts: The relative orientation of the city grid with respect to the camera completely determines how these four cardinal corner types will appear in the image. Currently, we compute this orientation from the given camera pose; however the city-grid orientation can also be computed more generally using vanishing point analysis <ref> [5] </ref>. Once this orientation information is known, the perspective transformation mapping 3D orthogonal corners into 2D image corners can be determined, and ideal corner masks can be generated to accurately extract these important low level corner features. Four different corner masks are generated.

Reference-contexts: Masks of this small size do well in localizing corners and in detecting non-obvious corners (see section 6), however they are sensitive to noise. The performance of template-based corner detection in grey level images with respect to detection, localization, and stability is discussed in <ref> [7] </ref>. In our system, we allow a large number of false positives when detecting corners and rely on the higher level grouping processes to discard incorrect low level features. Once constructed, each mask is convolved with the image and the correlation value at each pixel in the image stored.
