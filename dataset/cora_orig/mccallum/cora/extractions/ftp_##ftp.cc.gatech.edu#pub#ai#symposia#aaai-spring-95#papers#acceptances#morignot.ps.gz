Abstract: request ("Could you give 5 copies of such paper to that other person?") that will make the agent replan to produce a longer plan. In the middle of an action, the physiological motivation will exceed its threashold again, in which case the agent will generate a one-action plan to go to the closest electrical outlet and spontaneously recharge its batteries. As a result the behavior of the agent will be changed because of its own physiology. With its batteries recharged, the agent can then switch back to its original plan and successfully give the book and the copies. Since the agent follows its own motivations, it is always doing the right thingfrom its point of view. But there is no a priori guarantee that a particular motivational profile for a particular environment will produce good performances in others environments. To make this evaluation, we need first to define extrinsic criteria, i.e. a function from the environment only that will define the performances of the agent. We have briefly presented a framework for active agents, that integrates both the goal achievement desire of traditional A.I. and the survival instinct of new A.I. This framework is based on motivations as (1) a control mechanism for internal and external goal selection and (2) a generative mechanism for internal goal generation (usually resulting in one-action plans). We have then presented an architecture and an implementation of the framework, that enables the agent designer to preset the motivational profile of the agent, or the agent itself to change its own motivations on the fly (if it is able to recognize certains features of its environment). Our first experiments prove the feasability of this approach. Our ongoing research involves defining the performances criteria of the agent in each kind of environment, and proving the quality of each motivation profile by statistically proving the optimality of the behavior of the agent in each one of them.
