Reference-contexts: Here we consider a solid as a three-dimensional, connected and closed subset of Euclidean space. The coupling of solids constitutes a kinematic chain | rigid bodies related by means of mechanical constraints. This coupling takes place pairwise, and hence, it is given the name kinematic pair <ref> [1] </ref>. A kinematic pair thus produces a constrained relative motion of one body with respect to the other such that the specified contact remains. <p> The degree of freedom (D.O.F.) of a kinematic chain is defined as the necessary and sufficient number of variables that define uniquely the position and orientation of all the links of the chain <ref> [1] </ref>. The problem of determining the number of D.O.F. of motion for mechanism which are constituted only of rigid bodies is represented as the whole set of rigid body positions, i.e. a nonempty subset of the group of displacements.

Reference-contexts: Fortunately, such groups have been carefully studied (see <ref> [11, 24, 25] </ref>). A Frieze is a pattern which is invariant under all multiples of just one translation. The associated symmetry groups (the set of all isometries which map the pattern onto itself [24]) are commonly called frieze groups.

Reference-contexts: The complete symmetry group of a cylinder (finite or infinite), for example, cannot be handled using this method. 2.4 Intersecting Groups in a Geometric Manner Due to the fact that symbolic algebra is typically a costy computation on computers, an alternate though limited approach was proposed in <ref> [22] </ref> to deal with group intersections. An invariant S of a group G is defined to be a subset of R 3 such that for all g 2 G; g (S) = S. An invariant so defined is not unique for a group G. <p> An invariant so defined is not unique for a group G. For example, all the infinite cylinders with the same central axis but different radius are invariants of the same symmetry group. As stated in <ref> [22] </ref>, we can use a unique set of characteristic invariants as a way of characterizing some important subgroups of the Euclidean Group. <p> This makes it possible to start with two symmetry groups, compute their characteristic invariants, combine these invariants, and then recover the intersection of the original groups from the combined invariants. Only a set of seven non-trivial groups treated in <ref> [22] </ref> and they are continuous groups only. Because of the arbitrariness in the choice of invariants, it led to difficulties in extending that work beyond a limited class of groups 5 3 TR subgroups and their Characteristic Invariants It is possible to define a similarity metric between two isometries. <p> Subgroups of E + that consist entirely of isolated points in 4 Regular form means a group expressed as products of subgroups whose intersection is the identity group. 5 Nevertheless, in this article, we inherited the term characteristic invariants from <ref> [22] </ref> though they are defined differently. - 6 - Table 2: Tale 1 in Herve's 77 article: Conjugation classes of the subgroups of E + Dimension Notation Element Geometric element Associated D.O.F. description definition kinematic pair 0 E the identity rigid pair transformation 1 T D straight translations D is the

Reference-contexts: Isometries are distance preserving mappings in R 3 . Let us now consider all isometries that are linear. It has been proved <ref> [23] </ref> that all the linear isometries O are length preserving, i.e. for all x 2 R 3 ; kO (x)k = kxk. Furthermore, all linear, length preserving mappings are orthogonal and form a group. This is how the following group gets its name. <p> This is how the following group gets its name. Definition 3.14 O (3) is defined to be the real orthogonal group in three-space that contains all the linear isometries in R 3 .

Here I 3 is the 3 fi 3 identity matrix, and for all O 2 O (3); det (O) = 1. O (3) is the symmetry group of S 0 .

Reference-contexts: A set of figures similar to Figure 13 can be given for the Freize groups as well <ref> [26] </ref>. All the possible rotations can be represented explicitly in a primitive cell and then translated all over the space/plane/line.

Reference-contexts: The current implemented version has asymptotic time complexity O (n 2 ) + O (logM ) where n is the number of poles, and O (logM ) is the order of magnitude for computing the greatest common divisor for numbers a; b with M = M ax (a; b) <ref> [28] </ref>. The only case where n can be arbitrarily large is when both groups are dihedral groups.
