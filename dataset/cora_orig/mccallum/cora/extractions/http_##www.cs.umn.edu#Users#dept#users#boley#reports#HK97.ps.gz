Abstract: We show that an arbitrary Hankel matrix of a finite rank admits a Vandermonde decomposition: H = V T DV , where V is a confluent Vandermonde matrix and D is a block diagonal matrix. This result was first derived by Vandevoorde; our contribution here is a presentation that uses only linear algebra, specifically, the Jordan canonical form. We discuss the choices for computing this decomposition in only O(n 2 ) operations, and we illustrate how to employ the decomposition as a fast way to analyze a noisy signal.

Reference-contexts: This symmetric variant has similar costs. Once the tridiagonal matrix has been generated, the task is to find its eigen-values. There are two variants of the QR-type algorithm that can be applied here. One is the complex symmetric QR algorithm proposed in <ref> [4] </ref>, for which the matrix T must be symmetrized. Even when T is real, if the signs of the corresponding superdiagonal and subdiagonal entries of T are opposite, then the symmetrized matrix will be complex.

Reference-contexts: We conclude in Section 4 with an example illustrating to use the method to analyze a noisy signal. 2 Derivation via Jordan Canonical Form Assume that the matrix H of (1) has rank r. By a theorem of Gantmacher <ref> [5, vol. 2, p. 207] </ref>, the signal satisfies a recurrence relation of length r: h k = a r1 h k1 + a r2 h k2 + + a 0 h kr ; (3) which generates the entire signal once the r initial values fh 1 ; h 2 ; : <p> This is because the columns of any e P are Jordan chains, and there are only limited kinds of transformations to the Jordan chains that will yield the same Jordan form <ref> [5, vol. 1, p. 172] </ref>. Note that Q is block diagonal with blocks conforming to the Jordan blocks. For the purposes of computation, or for fixing ideas, it is often convenient to choose a specific P .

Reference-contexts: How can we recover the principal modes that generate the signal? A popular method by Kung <ref> [8] </ref> based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) is known to be an effective method for this purpose, but it suffers from the need to carry out both an SVD and a matrix eigensolution, each costing O (n 3 ) operations.

Reference-contexts: For step 1, we could solve for the coefficients in the recurrence (3) by simply plugging the values for h i (i = 1; : : : ; 2n 1), yielding a special set of n equations in n unknowns originally proposed by Prony <ref> [10] </ref> and popularized by Yule [14] and Walker [12]. Then we must find all the roots of the polynomial p (). Vandevoorde [11] proposed an alternative for step 1.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we consider the general case where the j 's are multiple. The factorization must be generalized so that the matrix D becomes block diagonal and the matrix V takes on a confluent Vandermonde structure. The theory was first developed in Vandevoorde's Ph.D. thesis <ref> [11] </ref>. The next section is devoted to a derivation of this generalized Vandermonde decomposition based entirely on concepts from linear algebra. In Section 3 we sketch how the decomposition can be computed quickly, viz., using O (n 2 ) operations and O (n) space. <p> Many of the individual pieces to the algorithms are off-the-shelf methods; some are quite experimental and some have received very little attention in the literature. The methods we present are based on the use of the Lanczos algorithm or its derivatives. Most details can be found in <ref> [11] </ref>. We begin with an outline of the basic steps: 1. Compute the "modes" generating the Hankel matrix, viz., the roots of the polynomial p () of (4). 2. <p> Then we must find all the roots of the polynomial p (). Vandevoorde <ref> [11] </ref> proposed an alternative for step 1. We use a variant of a nonsymmetric Lanczos process to generate a tridiagonal matrix T whose eigen-values match those of C. Then we compute the eigenvalues of T . <p> The nonsymmetric Lanczos process in <ref> [11] </ref> is equivalent to a procedure that bi-orthogonalizes the Krylov sequence we just mentioned against another sequence (called the "left" Krylov sequence). <p> We remark that one can still distinguish the two close peaks in this DFT corresponding to the two very close original modes. We should emphasize that the choice of criteria requires further study. Indeed, a more sophisticated selection criterion is presented in <ref> [11] </ref>. Fig. 1.

Reference-contexts: The resulting QR algorithm is a direct analog of the ordinary Hermitian QR method, but it uses complex orthogonal rotations and complex symmetric matrices instead of unitary rotations and Her-mitian matrices, respectively. Another option is to use the LR algorithm <ref> [13] </ref>, which is based on the LU factorization without pivoting to preserve the tridi-agonal structure. The LR algorithm can break down, but if a random shift is applied when zero pivot occurs during the LU factorization, the process can still exhibit very rapid convergence. <p> The LR algorithm can break down, but if a random shift is applied when zero pivot occurs during the LU factorization, the process can still exhibit very rapid convergence. If T is real, an implicit double-shift LR algorithm can in principle be carried out in real arithmetic <ref> [13] </ref>. Both algorithms require linear time for each iteration in a manner very similar to the Hermitian analog, and the number of iterations is generally O (n) in a manner very similar to the QR algorithm usually employed.
