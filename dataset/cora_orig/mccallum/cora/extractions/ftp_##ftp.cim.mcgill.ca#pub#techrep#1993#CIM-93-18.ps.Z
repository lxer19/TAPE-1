This electrophysiological evidence correlates well with psychophysical evidence which shows a rise in visual acuity with rising illumination levels [39][41]. Horizontal cell receptive fields are generated in our model by further diffusing the cone outputs. The 16 5.

Reference-contexts: Using a foveated sampling scheme for data reduction not only reduces the computations required at the retinal or sensor level, but has even greater savings for all further visual processing. We use a technique for data reduction based on Wilson's model [48] and recently implemented by Bolduc <ref> [4] </ref> using a small network of DSPs. Figure 2 shows schematically how the input image is transformed by the log-polar transformation used by the computer retina. is broken down into foveal and peripheral regions using nonuniform sampling.

Reference-contexts: The gain or sensitivity of the cone photoreceptor is modified by two main factors: visual photopig-ment bleaching y and the multiplicative network feedback from horizontal cells. Equation (7) may be used to model the effects of both these mechanisms <ref> [7] </ref>. When considering the steady-state effects of pigment bleaching alone, I a is assumed to be the steady-state intensity impinging on the cone. Pigment bleaching is very localized and pigment bleached from one cone does not appear to significantly affect the sensitivity of neighbouring cones [8][28][43]. <p> A much faster mechanism which modifies the cone sensitivity to match the local spatial ambient intensity almost instantaneously is mediated through horizontal cell feedback to the cones [11]. Chang <ref> [7] </ref> shows that if the horizontal cell feedback signal is used to compute an effective local spatial ambient intensity I S , then equation (7) may be used to model the effects of this adaptation mechanism as well.

Reference-contexts: of interplexiform cell feedback on horizontal cell RF sizes [42], will be discussed in more detail in the section on adaptation. * Two major classes of ganglion cells (P-cells and M-cells) account for 90% of the retinal output and represent the two distinct channels of information emanating from the retina <ref> [13] </ref>. P-cells are more numerous (80% of all ganglion cells), have smaller receptive fields and respond to higher spatial frequencies than M-cells. M-cells have larger receptive fields, higher contrast gain, and are more responsive to temporal stimulation [20].

Reference-contexts: Experiments with the model are presented in an accompanying report [35] 2. Implementation Overview The computer retina model presented here is in part based on the spatiotemporal Centre-Surround operators (CS) presented by Fleet <ref> [14] </ref> and Richter [26]. The CS operator is essentially a spatiotem-poral difference-of-Gaussians operator which describes some of the receptive field (RF) properties of ganglion cells but ignores the nonlinear transduction and adaptation which occur at earlier stages 4 2. <p> Our familiar simple exponential lowpass temporal filter K (t; t ) (equation (3)) is used once again to model this characteristic with t midget = 15 ms. The computations at the midget bipolar cell level in the computer retina are implemented as in Fleet <ref> [14] </ref>, Richter [26], and Curlander [9] (equation (17)) with the addition of a saturation function (equation (18)). <p> This delay appears to occur at the diffuse bipolar cell terminal and not at the horizontal cell output. The value used for t delay is chosen to be 3 ms or 0:2 t horz as suggested by Richter [26] and Fleet <ref> [14] </ref>. <p> Rather than simply subsampling the input image in the periphery, the log-polar mapping function implements RF's which average an increasing number of pixel values with increasing eccentricity. y The actual number of inputs from horizontal cells to diffuse bipolars is still unknown [5][11][28]. 21 Fleet <ref> [14] </ref> shows that the centre-surround (CS) model may be used to model operators with a range of spatiotemporal sensitivities with only a change in some parameters. <p> Features of the peripheral processing such as the increase of receptive field sizes with eccentricity are accounted for by the log-polar mapping and made transparent to the computations required in the model. The model is an extension of the spatiotemporal centre-surround operators presented by Fleet <ref> [14] </ref> and Richter [26]. The extensions include modelling the nonlinear transduction and adaptation at the photoreceptor level, and adaptation of receptive fields of various cells with varying illumination levels.

Reference-contexts: This operation serves to strip the 'dc' background intensity information from the visual signal and allows the bipolar cell to be sensitive to local variations in contrast <ref> [16] </ref>. * The retina adapts the size of its receptive fields as a function of illumination level in an effort to maintain a good balance between high visual acuity and contrast detectability [1][38][47][52]. fl Local in the above context means a small neighbourhood or area around a given photoreceptor. y The <p> For illumination intensities above 1000 trolands (td), visual acuity quickly reaches a plateau. At these illuminations, the Gaussian-weighted ganglion cell RF centres have sizes as small as 10 m (4 cone spacings) which corresponds to a Gaussian width parameter of cone = 1.5 cone spacings <ref> [16] </ref>. We assume that cone which controls the cone coupling (and is a measure of the cone RF size) is approximately inversely related to equation (11) used to fit the human acuity data and has a minimum value of cone = 1.5.

Reference-contexts: Diffusion in both the cone and horizontal cell layers is equivalent to repeated convolution of the input signal with Gaussians of width cone and horz and the overall effective horizontal cell Gaussian width surround is given by the following simple relation <ref> [17] </ref>: surround 2 = cone 2 + horz 2 (15) The widths of the centre and surround portions of the difference-of-Gaussians RF field formed at the bipolar and ganglion cell level are cone and surround respectively.

Reference-contexts: The main emphasis of the model presented here is to demonstrate how different adaptation mechanisms play a role in extending the operating range of the primate retina. 2.1 Nonuniform Sampling and Log-Polar Mappings The advantages of using a foveated sensor array are argued by Kronauer <ref> [19] </ref>. Such an approach offers a tremendous reduction in the data that must be processed by all subsequent levels of the system while still retaining a small high-resolution sampled fovea.

Reference-contexts: P-cells are more numerous (80% of all ganglion cells), have smaller receptive fields and respond to higher spatial frequencies than M-cells. M-cells have larger receptive fields, higher contrast gain, and are more responsive to temporal stimulation <ref> [20] </ref>. In summary, the biological retina is more than just a simple video camera. It not only converts optical information to electrical signals but performs considerable processing on the visual signal itself before transmitting it to higher levels. <p> Even though the cone system codes chromatic as well as achromatic information, many visual tasks can be accomplished with pure intensity information. It has also been theorized that, although chromatic and achromatic information are carried in the same pathway, the two signals may be processed separately at higher levels <ref> [20] </ref>. * In the biological retina, ganglion cells come in two varieties, on-centre and off-centre, to code positive and negative contrast signals, respectively. Unlike the biological retina, the computer can represent positive and negative signals equally well in the same output.

Reference-contexts: to model certain aspects of the retinal function <ref> [21] </ref>[23][30][40]. In addition, several computer models have been developed [3][7][15][37][49]. Each implementation accounts for certain specific aspects of the retinal function and most incorporate nonlinear or logarithmic transduction at the photoreceptor level but not local adaptation. To date, Mahowald's Adaptive Silicon Retina [21] is the only device with locally adaptive photoreceptors. Lateral inhibition or a differencing operation, at either the receptor or a subsequent level, is another common feature found in most of these models [14][21][23][40].

Reference-contexts: The local nature of information processing in the retina makes working in the log-polar domain advantageous and greatly simplifies the implementation of the computer retina. For example, in the biological retina, the diameters of ganglion cell RF's are known to scale approximately linearly with eccentricity <ref> [28] </ref>. In the log-polar domain, operator sizes are automatically scaled linearly with eccentricity [29][48]. 2.2 Diffusion, Gaussian Convolution, and Receptive Fields The summation of inputs within the circular receptive fields (RF) of most cells is assumed to be a Gaussian-weighted average of the inputs. <p> The primate horizontal cells which are of concern here are the type HI cells. These horizontal cells are believed to be achromatic and receive inputs from many cones within their receptive fields <ref> [28] </ref>. The sizes of their dendritic fields scale up linearly with eccentricity [13][28]. In addition, passive conduction of signals through gap junctions between neighbouring horizontal cells greatly extends the size of their receptive fields (RF) in comparison to their dendritic spreads [24][1]. <p> The next two sections describe the computations performed in the midget and diffuse bipolar cell layers. 5. Midget Bipolar Cell Output bipolar cells receive centre input from a single cone in the fovea and surround input from one or more horizontal cells <ref> [28] </ref>. In the fovea, for both the on and the off pathways, there is a 1:1 ratio of the number of midget bipolar cells to cones. <p> The properties of the diffuse bipolar cell relevant to the current model are listed below: * Each diffuse bipolar cell in the fovea receives centre input from at least 7-9 cones <ref> [28] </ref>. This number grows rapidly in the periphery as the ganglion cell density drops off faster with increasing eccentricity than does the cone density fl . Thus, diffuse bipolar cells have receptive field centres about 3 times larger than the midget bipolar cells at all eccentricities. <p> resolution in the M-cell pathway compared to the high acuity P-cell pathway. * According to Rodieck, there is a 1:1 ratio of the number of diffuse bipolar cells to cones, and thus there is a great deal of overlap between the centre portions of the diffuse bipolar cell receptive fields <ref> [28] </ref>. However, at the ganglion cell layer, the ratio of M-type ganglion cells to diffuse bipolars is only about 1:8. <p> IPX cells primarily receive a spatio-temporal contrast signal from the outputs of several bipolar cells in their receptive fields. Foveal IPX dendritic fields are approximately 100-200m in diameter (4-8 cone spacings) <ref> [28] </ref>. Their outputs feed back to horizontal cells where they modify the gap junction conductivity and multiplicatively alter the diffusivity. Umino's data show that flickering light leads to increased IPX output and up to a 30% reduction in the horizontal cell gap junction conductivity [42]. <p> This value is chosen to be consistent with the anatomical data from Rodieck <ref> [28] </ref>. It is, however, quite possible that IPX receptive fields could be much larger than their dendritic field size.

Reference-contexts: Foveated sampling may also be mimicked by uniform-sampling CCD cameras using log-polar transformations on the input image before further processing is performed <ref> [29] </ref>[48][51][4]. The motivation for such mappings is based on the close fit of the log-polar mappings of the visual field into V1 of the cortex [29]. Using a foveated sampling scheme for data reduction not only reduces the computations required at the retinal or sensor level, but has even greater savings for all further visual processing.

In general, these retinal model implementations, whether in software or silicon, limit themselves to mimicking logarithmic transduction and lateral inhibition but ignore other aspects of retinal processing, such as adaptation of receptive field (RF) sizes with illumination level or local spatio-temporal contrast. <p> Such an approach offers a tremendous reduction in the data that must be processed by all subsequent levels of the system while still retaining a small high-resolution sampled fovea. Although one group has developed a VLSI foveated sensor, the number of photosensitive elements in this sensor is rather small <ref> [30] </ref>. Foveated sampling may also be mimicked by uniform-sampling CCD cameras using log-polar transformations on the input image before further processing is performed [29][48][51][4]. The motivation for such mappings is based on the close fit of the log-polar mappings of the visual field into V1 of the cortex [29].

Reference-contexts: We use the simplest approach here. The weighted horizontal cell signal is simply subtracted from the cone output. The strength of this feedback path was chosen experimentally to be k hc = 0:15 as it gave close agreement with the responses of monkey cones for flash experiments <ref> [32] </ref> and gecko photoreceptors [11]. Values smaller than this produce negligible effect on the cone output while 14 4.

Reference-contexts: For each layer of "cells" in the computer retina, the computations performed at that layer are described, as well as the assumptions and simplifications made in the model. Experiments with the model are presented in an accompanying report <ref> [35] </ref> 2. Implementation Overview The computer retina model presented here is in part based on the spatiotemporal Centre-Surround operators (CS) presented by Fleet [14] and Richter [26]. <p> This report has provided a model of the processing of achromatic cone information in the primate retina. The model may hopefully serve as the basis for the design of new locally-adaptive machine vision sensors. In an accompanying report <ref> [35] </ref>, the behaviour of the model will be examined in response to a variety of stimuli and compared to published data on biological retinas. 28 10.

Reference-contexts: Figure (b) shows in block form the computations performed at the diffuse bipolar cell layer. M X cells which make up the bulk (80%) of the M-cells, are linear in their summation of signals, and appear to receive relatively little amacrine cell input <ref> [36] </ref>. This situation is very much like that for midget bipolars and midget ganglion (P-type) cells whose outputs were assumed to be very similar. Thus, for simplicity, it is assumed in this model that diffuse bipolar cell outputs and M X cell outputs are also similar. <p> Furthermore, M-cells typically have faster axon conduction velocities <ref> [36] </ref>. The time constants in the cone and horizontal cell layers (t cone ,t horz ) are fixed. The larger latency of the horizontal cell layer compared to the cone layer leads to much of the temporal sensitivity of bipolar cells in general. <p> the temporal sensitivity of diffuse bipolar / M-cells may be accounted for by this small delay in the surround input. * M-type ganglion cells react to contrast with a much higher gain than P-type ganglion cells and have a threshold to saturation range of only 1 log unit of contrast <ref> [36] </ref>. It is assumed here that this feature is exhibited at the diffuse bipolar cell level. <p> The basic properties of 80% of the M-type ganglion cells are similar to the outputs of diffuse bipolar cells. These cells are much like cat X-cells and thus they behave similarly to P-cells in their linear summation of signals <ref> [36] </ref>. Amacrine cell input does not seem to have a major impact on the output of these cells. It is only the remaining 20% of the M-type ganglion cells (M Y ) that likely receive considerable input from amacrine cells.

Reference-contexts: We use similar values in our model. 3.3 Cone Coupling Anatomical evidence of gap junctions between cones indicates that cones may be coupled (to neigh-bouring cones) both within the fovea and in the periphery <ref> [41] </ref>. Psychophysical data show that the acuity of the visual system improves with increasing illumination levels and reaches a plateau only at moderately bright illumination levels (I 10 4 trolands) [47][39]. <p> This ratio is maintained as a base level in our model. Biological evidence suggests that the RF size of horizontal cells is modulated by modifying the conductivity of gap junctions between horizontal cells <ref> [41] </ref>. Like the cones, the need for modulating horizontal cell receptive field sizes can be validated by signal processing arguments [38][52] and supported by psychophysical data showing improved visual acuity with rising illumination levels [39][47].

Reference-contexts: This mechanism sharpens spatial edges in the retinal output and improves sensitivity to temporal changes in the visual input. This hypothesis, which is supported by data on the effects of interplexiform cell feedback on horizontal cell RF sizes <ref> [42] </ref>, will be discussed in more detail in the section on adaptation. * Two major classes of ganglion cells (P-cells and M-cells) account for 90% of the retinal output and represent the two distinct channels of information emanating from the retina [13]. <p> The conductivity of gap junctions between horizontal cells (and hence horz [r; t]) may be modified in at least two ways. Dopamine released by interplexiform (IPX) cells (and perhaps amacrine cells) feeds back to the horizontal cell layer and modifies the conductivity of horizontal cell gap junctions <ref> [42] </ref>. In addition, there is a yet unknown mechanism triggered by the local background illumination level which alters the horizontal cell gap junction conductivity without any change in dopamine levels released by IPX cells [1]. <p> Their outputs feed back to horizontal cells where they modify the gap junction conductivity and multiplicatively alter the diffusivity. Umino's data show that flickering light leads to increased IPX output and up to a 30% reduction in the horizontal cell gap junction conductivity <ref> [42] </ref>. His results also show that changes in the background illumination level have no effect on the IPX cell outputs. <p> To be consistent with Umino's data, IPX feedback is assumed to be able to alter the horizontal cell receptive field size by up to 30% <ref> [42] </ref>. This hypothesis is supported by Umino's data on increased IPX output in response to flickering light stimuli (high temporal contrast) [42]. <p> To be consistent with Umino's data, IPX feedback is assumed to be able to alter the horizontal cell receptive field size by up to 30% <ref> [42] </ref>. This hypothesis is supported by Umino's data on increased IPX output in response to flickering light stimuli (high temporal contrast) [42]. Since the bipolar cell output is unaffected by global changes in illumination level (due to the "dc" subtraction mechanism), it is not surprising that IPX cell outputs are also unaffected for this condition.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the scope of the model has been limited as follows: * Only the cone system is modeled. Over much of the retina's response range, the cone and rod systems function fairly independently <ref> [43] </ref>. The cone system, with its high resolution fovea, is responsible for our high acuity daylight vision and is thus more appropriate for modeling when considering a potential silicon implementation. * Only achromatic intensity information is considered.

Reference-contexts: Using a foveated sampling scheme for data reduction not only reduces the computations required at the retinal or sensor level, but has even greater savings for all further visual processing. We use a technique for data reduction based on Wilson's model <ref> [48] </ref> and recently implemented by Bolduc [4] using a small network of DSPs. Figure 2 shows schematically how the input image is transformed by the log-polar transformation used by the computer retina. is broken down into foveal and peripheral regions using nonuniform sampling. <p> Outside the fovea is a peripheral region that consists of radially concentric rings whose diameters scale exponentially with eccentricity (r). The number of sampling regions per ring are fixed while the dimensions of the sampling regions grow linearly with eccentricity (r). This is equivalent to a log-polar transformation <ref> [48] </ref>. The peripheral data are represented in the log-polar domain while the foveal data are represented in the linear-Cartesian domain. To simplify the computations, both the foveal and peripheral data structures are extended so that they slightly overlap each other. <p> DIFFUSION, GAUSSIAN CONVOLUTION, AND RECEPTIVE FIELDS 7 Cartesian domain image approximate the number of cones sampling the retinal image. Also, the number of pixels in the two transformed images (fovea and periphery) match the number of P-type ganglion cells <ref> [48] </ref>. The foveal region is represented in the original Cartesian coordinates and is an area of uniform sampling, where for every pixel in the input image, there is one output pixel. <p> The number of sampling regions along each ring is constant, while the dimensions of the sampling regions grow linearly with eccentricity. These aspects of the log-polar mapping model the variations in size and spacing of receptive fields of most retinal cells with increasing eccentricity <ref> [48] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION with Permission of MIT Press. 3 At dim photopic illumination levels, the input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is relatively low; the retina compensates for this by averaging information over larger receptive fields to improve absolute contrast detectability at the expense of slightly poorer visual acuity <ref> [52] </ref>. <p> The exceptions to this are a rod system model by Yellott <ref> [52] </ref> and a model for an adaptive gain-control camera by Zeevi [53].
