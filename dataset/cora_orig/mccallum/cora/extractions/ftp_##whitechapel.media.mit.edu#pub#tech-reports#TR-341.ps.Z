Abstract: MIT Media Laboratory, Perceptual Computing Technical Report #341 Abstract The implications of this fact are important for bringing 3-D computer vision systems out of the laboratory and into practical use. Cumbersome calibration objects and all but the simplest image processing are not required. The accuracy of calibration that can be achieved has no theoretical limit since an arbitrarily large amount of data can be collected. Also, our calibration procedure addresses problems that are difficult or impossible for traditional calibration techniques, including wide-baseline stereo. We present a solution technique for self-calibration from one tracked point and verify its viability on synthetic and real stereo rigs.

Reference-contexts: Because of this, it is often reported, as in a later calibration work [ 2 ] , that estimation based on epipolar constraints can be unreliable in the presence of significant measurement noise.

We use slightly different priors and we iterate, since the relative orientation can be large, but otherwise use the SfM estimator "off-the-shelf". <p> ; t Z fi R ; R b ; fi R ; fi L ; ff L1 ; ; ff LN ) (4) where N is the number of points collected.

The authors touched on the topic of temporal integration of stereo correspondences as they described an extended Kalman filter for recursively computing the self-calibration from point correspondences on a moving stereo rig.
