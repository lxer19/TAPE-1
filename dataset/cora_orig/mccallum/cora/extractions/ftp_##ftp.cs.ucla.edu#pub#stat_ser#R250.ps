Title: An Axiomatic Characterization of Causal Counterfactuals

Abstract: This paper studies the causal interpretation of counterfactual sentences using a modifiable structural equation model. It is shown that two properties of counterfactuals, namely, composition and effectiveness, are sound and complete relative to this interpretation, when recursive (i.e., feedback-less) models are considered. Composition and effectiveness also hold in Lewis's closest-world semantics, which implies that for recursive models the causal interpretation imposes no restrictions beyond those embodied in Lewis's framework. A third property, called reversibility, holds in nonrecursive causal models but not in Lewis's closest-world semantics, which implies that Lewis's axioms do not capture some properties of systems with feedback. Causal inferences based on counterfactual analysis are exemplified and compared to those based on graphical models.

Reference-contexts: Naturally, such definitions attract criticism from strict empiricists, who regard unobservables as metaphysical or definitional [Richard, 1980; Engle et al., 1983; Holland, 1988], and from counterfactual analysts, who regard the use of equations as an unwarranted commitment to a particular functional form <ref> [Angrist et al., 1996] </ref>. The analyses of this paper shed new light on this controversy by explicating the operational meaning of the "so-called disturbance terms" [Richard, 1980] and by clarifying the relationships among error-based, counterfactual, and graphical definitions. These three modes of description form a simple hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: Section 6 concludes with remarks on the role of counter-factual calculus vis a vis structural equations and graphs. 2 Causal Models 2.1 Definitions A causal model is a mathematical object that provides an interpretation (and effective computation) of every causal query about the domain. Following <ref> [Pearl, 1995a] </ref>, we adopt here a construct named modifiable structural equations, that generalizes most causal models used in engineering, biology, and economics. <p> The advantages of using hypothetical external interventions to convey the notion of "local change" are emphasized in <ref> [Pearl, 1995a, p. 706] </ref>. 4 Definition 5 (counterfactual) Let Y be a variable in V , and let X a subset of V . <p> In <ref> [Pearl, 1995a] </ref> this problem was solved by a graphical method, using a set of axioms which, when certain conditions hold in the graph, transform expressions of the form P (yjz; do (x)) into other expressions of this type, so as to eliminate the do () operator. <p> To this end, 9 For an excellent historical account of this debate, see [Spirtes et al., 1993, pp. 291-302]. 16 we first need to translate the assumptions embodied in the graphical model into the lan-guage of counterfactuals. In <ref> [Pearl, 1995a, p. 704] </ref> it is shown that the translation can be accomplished systematically, using two simple rules: Rule 1 Exclusion restrictions. <p> Substituting gives us X P (zjx) x 0 The right hand side of Eq. (36) can be computed from P (x; y; z) and coincides with the "front-door" formula derived in <ref> [Pearl, 1995a] </ref>. In general, a counterfactual quantity such as P (Y x = y) that can be reduced to expressions involving probabilities of observed variables is called identifiable [Fisher, 1966; Pearl, 1997b]. <p> This definition paraphrases the "back-door criterion" <ref> [Pearl, 1995a] </ref> in the special case of no covariates. The incorporation of observed covariates is straightforward in all three definitions. 21 definitional, as suggested by Hendry (1995, p. 62) and Holland (1988, p. 460).

Reference-contexts: From a broader perspective, however, the error terms can be viewed as (summaries of) a highly structured background knowledge, whose empirical basis may well lie outside the boundaries of specific study at hand [Pearl, 1998a]. A three-level hierarchy similarly characterizes the notion of instrumental variables <ref> [Bow-den and Turkington, 1984; Pearl, 1995b] </ref>. The traditional definition qualifies a variable Z as instrument (relative the pair (X; Y )) if (i) Z is independent of all terms in the equation for Y (excluding X and variables affected by X) and (ii) Z is not independent of X.

Reference-contexts: In general, a counterfactual quantity such as P (Y x = y) that can be reduced to expressions involving probabilities of observed variables is called identifiable <ref> [Fisher, 1966; Pearl, 1997b] </ref>. Our completeness result implies that any identifiable counterfactual quantity can be reduced to the correct expression by repeated application of composition and effectiveness. 6 Conclusions and Discussion The completeness of composition and effectiveness in recursive causal models has two major implications.

Reference-contexts: The statistics of these variations are observable when pa Y is held fixed. From a broader perspective, however, the error terms can be viewed as (summaries of) a highly structured background knowledge, whose empirical basis may well lie outside the boundaries of specific study at hand <ref> [Pearl, 1998a] </ref>. A three-level hierarchy similarly characterizes the notion of instrumental variables [Bow-den and Turkington, 1984; Pearl, 1995b].

Reference-contexts: The substantive knowledge available at the modeling phase cannot support such assumptions unless they are stable, that is, insensitive to the values of the parameters involved <ref> [Pearl, 1998b] </ref>. The implications of graphical models, which rest solely on the interconnections among mechanisms, satisfy this stability requirement and can therefore be ascertained from generic substantive knowledge, before data are collected.

Reference-contexts: Naturally, such definitions attract criticism from strict empiricists, who regard unobservables as metaphysical or definitional <ref> [Richard, 1980; Engle et al., 1983; Holland, 1988] </ref>, and from counterfactual analysts, who regard the use of equations as an unwarranted commitment to a particular functional form [Angrist et al., 1996]. <p> The analyses of this paper shed new light on this controversy by explicating the operational meaning of the "so-called disturbance terms" <ref> [Richard, 1980] </ref> and by clarifying the relationships among error-based, counterfactual, and graphical definitions. These three modes of description form a simple hierarchy. Since graph separation implies independence, 20 but independence does not imply graph separation [Pearl, 1988], definitions based on graph separation should imply those based on error-term independence.

Reference-contexts: For example, among their most commonly employed rules is the implication (called consistency <ref> [Robins, 1987] </ref>): X = x =) Y (x; u) = Y (u) (1) which states that the potential response of patient u to a hypothetical treatment x, Y (x; u), must coincide with the patient's observed response, Y (u), whenever the actual treatment X happened to be x.

Reference-contexts: on Y is identical to the conditional probability of Y given X, namely, if P (Y x = y) = P (yjx) (37) or, equivalently, P (Y = yjdo (x)) = P (yjx) (38) which, in turns, is equivalent to the independence condition Y x k X, named "ignorability" in <ref> [Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983] </ref>. This definition is pragmatic, in that it highlights the reasons economists should be concerned with exogeneity by explicating the policy-analytic benefits of discovering that a variable is exogenous.

Reference-contexts: Respondents had no problem answering question 2, one person was able to solve question 1, and none managed to answer question 3. Pearl (1997a) suggests an explanation. 6 Consistency and composition are informally used in economics [Manski, 1990] and statistics within the potential-response framework <ref> [Rubin, 1974] </ref>. To the best of our knowledge, Robins (1987) was the first to state consistency formally and to use it to derive other properties of counterfactuals. <p> This establishes, in essence, the formal equivalence of structural equation modeling, popular in economics and the social sciences [Goldberger, 1992], and the potential-response framework, as used in statistics <ref> [Rubin, 1974; Holland, 1986; Robins, 1986] </ref>. 10 In nonrecur-sive models, however, this is not necessarily the case.

In [Pearl, 1995a, p. 704] it is shown that the translation can be accomplished systematically, using two simple rules: Rule 1 Exclusion restrictions.
