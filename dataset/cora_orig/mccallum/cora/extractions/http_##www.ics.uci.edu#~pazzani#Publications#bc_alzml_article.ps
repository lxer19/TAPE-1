Reference-contexts: Artificial intelligence approaches to medicine started with knowledge-based systems, constructed from knowledge provided by human experts, not data. Beginning with the expert systems of the seventies (MYCIN [Shortliffe, 1976], PUFF <ref> [Aikins et al., 1982] </ref>), followed by Bayesian systems of the late eighties and early nineties (ACORN [Wyatt, 1989], PATHFINDER [Heckerman et al., 1992]), these knowledge-based systems generated much enthusiasm. But there are very few such actual systems in routine clinical use.

Reference-contexts: But there are very few such actual systems in routine clinical use. Another approach starting in the mid eighties sought to make use of real data and a domain model for knowledge acquisition and rule learning [Cestnik et al., 1987],[Michalski et al., 1986], [Lavrac and Mozetc, 1992]. KARDIO <ref> [Bratko et al., 1989] </ref> is an expert system for evaluation of electrocardiograms based on this approach. With increasing availability of electronic medical records, machine learning has the potential to become a valuable adjunct to clinical decision-making. There has been some recent effort in this direction [Ohmann et al., 1995].
