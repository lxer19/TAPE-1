Reference-contexts: In other words, any binary sequence of length k can be calculated by this computer M if it is given an appropriate program at most k +1 bits in length. The proof is as follows.

It seems plausible that a sequence of 0's and 1's is patternless if there is no better way to calculate it than just by writing it all out at once from a table giving the whole sequence.
