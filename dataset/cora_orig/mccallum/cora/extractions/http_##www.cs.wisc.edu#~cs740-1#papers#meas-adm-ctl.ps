Title: A Measurement-based Admission Control Algorithm for Integrated Services Packet Networks (Extended Version)  
Author: Sugih Jamin, Peter B. Danzig, Scott J. Shenker, and Lixia Zhang 
Abstract: Many designs for integrated services networks offer a bounded delay packet delivery service to support real-time applications. To provide bounded delay service, networks must use admission control to regulate their load. Previous work on admission control mainly focused on algorithms that compute the worst case theoretical queueing delay to guarantee an absolute delay bound for all packets. In this paper we describe a measurement-based admission control algorithm for predictive service, which allows occasional delay violations. We have tested our algorithm through simulations on a wide variety of network topologies and driven with various source models, including some that exhibit long-range dependence, both in themselves and in their aggregation. Our simulation results suggest that measurement-based approach combined with the relaxed service commitment of predictive service enables us to achieve a high level of network utilization while still reliably meeting delay bound.

Reference-contexts: The traditional real-time service provides a hard or absolute bound on the delay of every packet; in <ref> [FV90, CSZ92] </ref>, this service model is called guaranteed service. Admission control algorithms for guaranteed service use the a priori characterizations of sources to calculate the worst-case behavior of all the existing flows in addition to the incoming one. <p> Many real-time applications, such as vat, nv, and vic, have recently been developed for packet-switched networks. These applications adapt to actual packet delays and are thus rather tolerant of occasional delay bound violations; they do not need an absolutely reliable bound. For these tolerant applications, references <ref> [CSZ92, SCZ93] </ref> proposed predictive service, which offers a fairly, but not absolutely, reliable bound on packet delivery times. The ability to occasionally incur delay violations gives admission control a great deal more flexibility, and is the chief advantage of predictive service. <p> The ability to occasionally incur delay violations gives admission control a great deal more flexibility, and is the chief advantage of predictive service. The measurement based admission control approach advocated in <ref> [CSZ92, JSZC92] </ref> uses the a priori source characterizations only for incoming flows (and those very recently admitted); it uses measurements to characterize those flows that have been in place for a reasonable duration. Therefore, network utilization does not suffer significantly if the traffic descriptions are not tight. <p> Second, reliably ensuring that the failure rate never exceeds a particular level leads to the same worst-case calculations that predictive ser 1 We refer the interested readers to [Jam95] for a more comprehensive overview and bibliography of admission control algorithms. vice was designed to avoid. Instead, the CSZ approach <ref> [CSZ92] </ref> proposes that the level of reliability be a contractual matter between a network provider and its customersnot something specified on a per-flow basis. <p> The second aspect is the measurement process itself, which we will describe in Section 3. In this section we present the analytical underpinnings of our admission control criteria. Sources requesting service must characterize the worst-case behavior of their flow. In <ref> [CSZ92] </ref> this characterization is done with a token bucket filter. A token bucket filter for a flow has two parameters: its token generation rate, r, and the depth of its bucket, b. <p> It is conceivable that future real-time applications will have a module that can, over time, learn a suitable r and b to bound their traffic. We have studied the behavior of our admission control algorithm mostly under the CSZ scheduling discipline <ref> [CSZ92] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Cruz, in [Cru91], derived a tight bound for the worst-case delay, D j , of priority queue level j. Our derivation follows Parekh's <ref> [Par92] </ref>, which is a simpler, but looser, bound for D fl j that assumes small packet sizes, i.e. the transmission time of each packet is sufficiently small (as compared to other delays) and hence can be ignored. <p> This assumption of small packet sizes further allows us to ignore delays caused by the lack of preemption. Further, we assume that the aggregate rate, aggregated over all traffic classes, is within the link capacity ( P Theorem 1 Parekh <ref> [Par92] </ref>: The worst-case class j delay, with FIFO discipline within the class and assuming infinite peak rates for the sources, is D fl P j i=1 r i for each class j. <p> the one-time delay burst that accrues if the aggregate bucket of all classes 1 through j flows are simultaneously dumped into the switch and all classes 1 through j 1 sources continue to send at their reserved rates. 3 For a proof of Theorem 1, we refer interested readers to <ref> [Par92] </ref>, Theorem 2.4 or [Jam95], Theorem 1. We now use Eq. 1 as the base equation to model the effect of admitting a new flow ff on existing predictive traffic. <p> In contrast, lower priority predictive traffic sees both the rates and buckets of higher priority predictive flows. A higher priority predictive flow not only squeezes the pipe available to lower priority traffic, but also preempts it. 2.2 Worst-case Delay: Guaranteed Service In reference <ref> [Par92] </ref>, the author proves that in a network with arbitrary topology, the WFQ scheduling discipline provides guaranteed delay bounds that depend only on flows' reserved rates and bucket depths. Under WFQ, each guaranteed flow is isolated from the others. <p> Thus for the POO2 model, the traffic seen on the wire may not be Pareto-ON/OFF. When a flow with token bucket parameters (r; b) requests guaranteed service, the maximal queueing delay (ignoring terms proportional to a single packet time) is given by b=r <ref> [Par92] </ref>. Column 10 of the table, labeled D fl , lists the guaranteed delay bound for each source given its assigned token bucket filter. Column 11, labeled D j , lists the predictive delay bound assigned to each source. We simulate only two classes of predictive service.

Reference-contexts: Recent studies ([LTWW94, DMRW94, PF94, KM94, GW94, BSTW95]) have shown that network traffic often exhibits long-range dependence (LRD), with the implications that congested periods can be quite long and a slight increase in number of active connections can result in large increase in packet loss rate <ref> [PF94] </ref>. Reference [PF94] further called attention to the possibly damaging effect long-range dependent traffic might have on measurement-based admission control algorithms. To investigate this and other LRD related questions, we augmented our simulation study with two LRD source models.

The duration of for LRD sources, however, are taken from a lognormal distribution, following [Bol94, DMRW94]. The interarrival times of all flows are exponentially distributed <ref> [PF94] </ref>. 4.3 Parameter Choices We chose six instantiations of the above three source models, as summarized in Table 2.

Reference-contexts: Many real-time applications, such as vat, nv, and vic, have recently been developed for packet-switched networks. These applications adapt to actual packet delays and are thus rather tolerant of occasional delay bound violations; they do not need an absolutely reliable bound. For these tolerant applications, references <ref> [CSZ92, SCZ93] </ref> proposed predictive service, which offers a fairly, but not absolutely, reliable bound on packet delivery times. The ability to occasionally incur delay violations gives admission control a great deal more flexibility, and is the chief advantage of predictive service.

Reference-contexts: In this approach, each flow is allotted an effective bandwidth that is larger than its average rate but less than its peak rate. In most cases the equivalent bandwidth is computed based on a statistical model <ref> [Hui88, SS91] </ref> Sugih Jamin was supported in part by the Uniforum Research Award and by the Office of Naval Research Laboratory under contract N00173-94-P-1205. <p> This approach is clearly not applicable to a large and heterogeneous application base, and is very different from our approach to admission control that is based on ongoing measurements. In references <ref> [SS91, AS94] </ref> the authors use measurement to learn the parameters of certain assumed traffic distributions. The authors of [DJM96, Flo96] use measurement of existing traffic in their calculation of equivalent bandwidth, providing load, but not delay, bound. In references [Hir91, CLG95], a neural network is used for dynamic bandwidth allocation.

Reference-contexts: In references [Hir91, CLG95], a neural network is used for dynamic bandwidth allocation. In [LCH95], the authors use pre-computed low frequency of flows to renegotiate bandwidth allocation.

Reference-contexts: Pareto shape parameter less than 1 gives data with infinite mean; shape parameter less than 2 results in data with infinite variance. The Pareto location parameter is mean fl (shape 1)=shape. Each Pareto-ON/OFF source by itself does not generate LRD series. However, the aggregation of them does <ref> [WTSW95] </ref>. LRD: Fractional ARIMA. We use each number generated by the fractional autoregressive integrated moving average (fARIMA) process ([HR89]) as the number of fixed-size packets to be sent back to back in each ON period. Interarrivals of ON periods are of fixed length. <p> Recall that in this paper we use fixed packet size and each of our token is worth 1 Kbits of data, which is also our packet size. The shape parameter of the Pareto distributed ON time (fi) of the Pareto-ON/OFF sources are selected following the observations in <ref> [WTSW95] </ref>. According to the same reference, the shape parameter of the Pareto distributed OFF time (fl) stays mostly below 1.5; in this paper we use fl of 1.1 for all POO sources.

Reference-contexts: Network utilization under this model is usually acceptable when flows are smooth; when flows are bursty, however, guaranteed service inevitably results in low utilization <ref> [ZF94] </ref>. Higher network utilization can be achieved by weakening the reliability of the delay bound. For instance, the probabilistic service described in [ZK94] does not provide for the worst-case scenario, instead it guarantees a bound on the rate of lost/late packets based on statistical characterization of traffic.
