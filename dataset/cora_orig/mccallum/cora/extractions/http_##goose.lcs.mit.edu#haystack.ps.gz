Title: Haystack: A Personal, Intelligent, Indexing System

Abstract: This paper is a technical discussion of the work done on Project Haystack. Haystack provides the software mechanisms necessary for a user to index information on their personal computer (or workspace). The intent of this system was to provide a means for a user to easily and intelligently access information stored on their local system as well as remote servers. Through Haystack a user can also annotate archived data with their own descriptions and comments. Haystack is currently in its first semipublic release for Unix workstations. The work done on Haystack was the result of the effort of a number of people at the LCS and AI labs. This paper describes the work done on Haystack as a whole, as well as my personal involvement in the project.

Reference-contexts: Below is a sampling of projects are currently in the works or are proposed for the near future. Lore: Lore is a database produced by the University of Stanford to store semi-structured data <ref> [QU94] </ref>, which is effectively the type of information we maintain in Haystack. It has come to our attention that keeping DFs in files is not necessarily the optimal answer. We would rather take the information stored in the DF and keep it within Lore.

Reference-contexts: The IR Interface: hs_call_ir_system Haystack is not an IR system. Rather we assume that there is some underlying IR system that is interfaceable by some method (either an API, or Unix I/O pipes). For the purpose of a first release we chose to use Managing Gigabytes, (MG) <ref> [WIT94] </ref>. Although we are not completely satisfied with the speed of (MG), it was publicly accessible and more importantly, it was (mostly) functional. 12 The IR interface, hs_call_ir_system is a library of primitive functions that form an abstraction layer for access to the IR system.
