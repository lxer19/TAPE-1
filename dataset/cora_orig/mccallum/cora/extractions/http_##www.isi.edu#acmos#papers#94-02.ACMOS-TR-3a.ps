Abstract: We describe a CMOS signal driver that, while meeting the same speed constraints, dissipates considerably less power than the commonly thought to be unavoidable. We give a design procedure that, given the available charging time, yields a driver with minimum dissipation. We also describe an experimental circuit that confirms the predictions. The driver should be especially useful for off-chip drivers for high-speed microprocessors.

Reference-contexts: Recently, the techniques of adiabatic switching have been added to the methods for dissipation reduction. The theoretical limit for adiabatic switching says that the dissipation is asymptotically proportional to the inverse of the charging time <ref> [1] </ref>. In contrast, when conventional techniques are used to charge and discharge a capacitance, the energy dissipated per charge-discharge cycle is independent of the time spent. Different techniques for adiabatic charging come more or less close to the theoretical limit. Circuits using inductors have been presented [1][3][4], in which the dissipation <p> Since clock periods in conventional CMOS are typically tens of nanoseconds, one can design logic that uses charging times orders of magnitude larger than , and thus dissipates orders of magnitude less energy per switching event. Logic schemes using the adiabatic charging effect include hot-clock nMOS <ref> [1] </ref>, adiabatic switching [2], and charge recovery logic [3].

Reference-contexts: Different techniques for adiabatic charging come more or less close to the theoretical limit. Circuits using inductors have been presented [1][3]<ref> [4] </ref>, in which the dissipation decreases as the square root of the inverse of the charging time when the time is increased [4]. At the cost of increased complexity, the asymptotic behavior of these circuits can be pushed closer to the ideal case [4]. However, the inductor approaches rely on precise timing of switches to realize the dissipation gains. <p> Circuits using inductors have been presented [1][3]<ref> [4] </ref>, in which the dissipation decreases as the square root of the inverse of the charging time when the time is increased [4]. At the cost of increased complexity, the asymptotic behavior of these circuits can be pushed closer to the ideal case [4]. However, the inductor approaches rely on precise timing of switches to realize the dissipation gains. Secondly, stray capacitances at the switches introduce parasitic oscillation modes that decrease the efficiency, and can cause destructive junction breakdowns unless care is taken in the circuit design. <p> Appendix B contains a somewhat lengthy derivation of the optimal value for one of the design parameters. 2 Adiabatic switching Adiabatic switching allows the designer to trade off the energy dissipation per switching event for the switching speed, without decreasing the voltage levels in the circuit <ref> [4] </ref>. The signal energy corresponding to a bit of information, determined by the node capacitance and the voltage swing, is thus maintained. The energy dissipation decrease compared to conventional charging is achieved by keeping the voltage across a conducting switch low throughout the charging of a node capacitance. <p> The overhead of creating a time-varying power signal using an inductance-based supply has been assumed to be negligible or avoidable [1][3], but has since been analyzed and measured for a simple circuit <ref> [4] </ref>, and shown to lead to a total energy savings which only decreases as the inverse of the square-root of the charging time , rather than as the inverse of . 3 Stepwise charging (SWC) 3.1 SWC principles Another way to charge a capacitance through a resistance while keeping the resistive <p> The optimum is decreased compared to the case without a series resistance, and the minimum energy dissipation is increased. 4 Experimental chip To verify the design method described in this report, we have designed, fabricated, and tested a stepwise driver to be used with an Adiabatic Line Driver Chip (ALDC) <ref> [4] </ref>. The ALDC is a driver for a printed circuit board bus, such as a memory address bus. The chip comprises eight differential drivers, each consisting of two transmission gates and two clamp devices. A schematic of one driver is shown in Figure 4. <p> A schematic of one driver is shown in Figure 4. The ALDC requires a companion circuit, an Adiabatic Power Supply (APS), that ramps an adiabatic supply voltage up and down. The original APS was an inductor-based design <ref> [4] </ref>. We will describe a new APS circuit based on stepwise charging. The configuration was chosen to facilitate a direct comparison with the original APS. <p> According to Equation (14), a 10 stage driver would give a dissipation improvement of 6.75 times, as compared to 4.95 times possible with the current configuration and 6.3 times reached by the inductor circuit reported previously <ref> [4] </ref>. The overhead for several individual drivers would be small, since multiple drivers working in synchrony can share control circuitry and tank capacitors.

Reference-contexts: Decreasing the on-resistance of device by increasing the width means increasing the gate capacitance: (9) is a quality measure of switch . It is similar to the transit time used by Mead and Conway to characterize the speed of an MOS technology <ref> [5] </ref>. However, it varies with the channel voltage and hence with , since the bulk-to-channel and gate-to-channel voltages are different for different tank voltages. Figure 3 illustrates the typical channel-voltage dependence for N-channel and P-channel devices.

Reference-contexts: The I/O frame is commonly responsible for a large part of the total power dissipation of a processor chip, up to 50% for the ATT 92010 (Hobbit) chip <ref> [6] </ref>, so improvements in this area are most welcome. Moreover, the desire to use low-cost, low-speed memory chips with high-performance processors has already caused the emergence of chips with decreased I/O clock rate [7].

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the desire to use low-cost, low-speed memory chips with high-performance processors has already caused the emergence of chips with decreased I/O clock rate <ref> [7] </ref>. For these processors, the introduction of power-saving stepwise pin drivers would have little or no performance impact, the only cost being the pins needed for the tank capacitors and the silicon area of the drivers.

Reference-contexts: If the tank capacitances were implemented in such a way, no pins would be wasted in connecting to them. More realistically, interconnection technologies already exist to connect thousands of signal pins to a single die <ref> [9] </ref>; using a few dozens of pins for these purposes would not be very significant in a pin budget of that magnitude. 6 Acknowledgments The research described in this report was supported by the Advanced Research Projects Agency under contract number DABT63-92-C-0052.
