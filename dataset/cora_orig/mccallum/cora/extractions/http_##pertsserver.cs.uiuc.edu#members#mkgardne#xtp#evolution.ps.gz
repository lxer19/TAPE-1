Title: The Evolution of XTP

Abstract: The design of XTP has been a 3 year process so far with roots traceable to work in the 1970's and 80's. There have been roughly ten distinct revisions of the protocol. Since Revision 3.4 in June 1989 there has been an effort to stabilize the design. This has been accomplished. The most recent versions Revision 3.4 and 3.5 were about 14 months apart whereas earlier versions were 3 to 6 months apart. Fortunately the net effect of the change from Revision 3.4 to 3.5 was to remove mechanism from the design. There have been at least nine distinct software implementations of the protocol. Experience with these implementations has been fed back into the protocol specification. We believe that the functionality in the present design, Revision 3.5 plus Addendum 1a, is strengthened by the number of alternative mechanisms that have been tried and rejected. XTP history and evolution will be reviewed in this paper with a focus on some of the protocol mechanisms that have changed over time.

Reference-contexts: By designing them into the unicast procedure we avoid having to add redundant functions to the base protocol for supporting multicast. Acknowledgements The architecture has been influenced by many other designs including Delta-T, VMTP, Datakit protocols, Netblt, Blast protocols, ATM, IP/TCP, GAM-T-103 <ref> [1] </ref>, the Cam-bridge Ring, and XNS. More people have contributed to the evolution of XTP than can be named here.

Reference-contexts: The real idea was to apply the principles of RISC cpu design to protocol and protocol-VLSI design: minimalist functionality == high clock rate. The initial meeting with ANSI led to publication of several white papers <ref> [3] </ref> and the adoption of a new name, Protocol Engine . We think of these papers as XTP Revision 1 which was basically a trailer protocol.

Reference-contexts: By the 1980's the balance changed so that most of the papers presented some aspect of networking in the context of operating systems. The papers presented in the first workshop in a series dedicated to protocol research <ref> [9] </ref> reference much of the work of the 1980's and suggest that the 1990's may be a time of significant progress in this area. Contemporary protocol research is influenced by developments in other technical fields.

This book also describes the Promela language and Spin software that have been used to formally model parts of XTP. During this same period several researchers at Bell Laboratories were practicing the art of rendering software algorithms into special-purpose hardware.
