Abstract: Manipulation tasks with actuator arrays fabricated in MEMS (micro electro mechanical system) technology can be modeled by the theory of programmable force fields, which describes the forces generated by the actuators as planar vector fields. Given a task (e.g., unique positioning of a part) and a part geometry, we develop algorithms that automatically generate the corresponding manipulation plans as a sequence of force fields. Programmable force fields are employed as an abstraction barrier between applications requiring array micromanipulation and their implementation with MEMS devices. The theory also provides upper and lower bounds (i.e., complexity, completeness, and impossibility results) for manipulation tasks and force fields. We derive a classification of vector fields, resulting in design criteria by which efficient manipulation strategies and effective actuator arrays may be developed. This theory is applicable to a wide variety of actuator arrays. When a part is placed on the array, the programmed vector field induces a force and moment upon it. Over time, the part may come to rest in a dynamic equilibrium state. By chaining together sequences of vector fields, the equilibrium states of a part in the field may be cascaded to obtain a desired final state. The resulting strategies work from any initial configuration (pose) of the part, require no sensing, and exhibit efficient planning algorithms. Massively-parallel, distributed manipulation tasks were performed with micro actuator arrays. Two different types of MEMS arrays were built using (1) single-crystal silicon electrostatic actuators, and (2) combined thermobimorph-electrostatic polyimide micro cilia. Force vector fields were implemented by fine-grained SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) control of individual actuators that perform cyclic, gait-like motions. We report on manipulation experiments in which the tasks of parts-translation, -rotation, -orientation and -centering were demonstrated using small integrated circuit (IC) dice. The results of the experiments are consistent with the behavior as predicted by the theory of programmable force fields.

We have proposed a combined radial + "gravitational" field R + ffiG which might have the UFO property [5]. Such a field could be obtained from a tilted MEMS array that implements a radial field.

Reference-contexts: This paper reports on progress towards computational MEMS, by taking on the challenge of design and control of massively-parallel micro actuator arrays. Our goal is to implement task-level, sensorless manipulation strategies with arrays of microfabricated actuators. The theory of programmable vector fields 1 <ref> [5] </ref> arguably represents the first systematic attack on massively-parallel, distributed manipulation based on geometric and physical reasoning. Applications such as parts-feeding can be formulated in terms of the force vector fields required. <p> Hence, such fields have been proposed for manipulation tasks in which we desire to cascade equilibria in order to uniquely pose or orient a part (for details see [7] and <ref> [5] </ref>). The theory of programmable vector fields permits calculation of stable equilibria for macroscopic parts in potential fields 2 (see Figure 15). <p> These programmable fields were implemented by moving the individual actuators in a cyclic, gait-like fashion. Motion 2 While this question has been well-studied for a point mass in a field, the issue is more subtle when lifted to a body with finite area, due to the moment covector. See <ref> [5] </ref> for details. 3 actuator is 180fi240 m 2 in size. Detail from a 1 in 2 array with more than 11,000 actuators.

(10 m spacing) with aluminum electrode underneath. <p> Definition 1 <ref> [5] </ref> Given a straight line l, a squeeze field f is a two-dimensional force vector field in which, at each point, a unit force points perpendicularly towards l (on l the force is zero). <p> P is in orienta-tional equilibrium if the moments acting on P are balanced. Total equilibrium is simultaneous translational and orientational equilibrium. 12 squeeze line will rotate indefinitely. Moreover, it has no stable equilibrium in this field. Claim 3 <ref> [5] </ref> Every squeeze field f (see Definition 1) has potential, of the form U (z) = Z f ds, where ff is an arbitrary path to z from a fixed reference point. <p> If d z denotes the perpendicular distance of z from the squeeze line, then U (d z ) = jd z j. Claim 4 <ref> [5] </ref> Let P be a connected polygonal part with finite contact area and n vertices. Then in any squeeze field, P has E = O (kn 2 ) orientation equilibria, where k is the maximum number of edges that a bisector of P can cross. <p> If the respective centers of gravity lie on a line perpendicular to the squeeze line, then the part is in equilibrium. For polygonal parts there exist analytical methods to compute the equilibria exactly (see <ref> [5] </ref> for a detailed algorithm and a derivation of the O (kn 2 ) bound). Claim 5 [5] Let P be a polygon whose interior is connected. There exists a sensorless alignment strategy consisting of a sequence of squeeze fields that uniquely orients P up to symmetries. <p> For polygonal parts there exist analytical methods to compute the equilibria exactly (see <ref> [5] </ref> for a detailed algorithm and a derivation of the O (kn 2 ) bound). Claim 5 [5] Let P be a polygon whose interior is connected. There exists a sensorless alignment strategy consisting of a sequence of squeeze fields that uniquely orients P up to symmetries. <p> The output of this algorithm is a sequence of squeeze directions. When the corresponding squeeze fields are applied to the part P , the set of possible orientations is successively reduced until a unique orientation (up to symmetry) is reached. For details see <ref> [5] </ref> and [12]. 2 Task: Orienting and Aligning Parts If a part is placed in a squeeze field, it will translate and rotate until a stable equilibrium is reached (Claim 4). Parts may exhibit several equilibria, hence after one squeeze the part orientation may be ambiguous. <p> This part alignment experiment has also been performed with similar results for several other small pieces of glass and silicon of a few mm length and several mg of mass. 13 4.2 Skewed Squeeze Fields Definition 6 <ref> [5] </ref> A skewed field f S is a vector field given by f S (x; y) = sign (x)(1; *), where 0 6= * 2 R. Claim 7 [5] No skewed squeeze field has a potential. <p> pieces of glass and silicon of a few mm length and several mg of mass. 13 4.2 Skewed Squeeze Fields Definition 6 <ref> [5] </ref> A skewed field f S is a vector field given by f S (x; y) = sign (x)(1; *), where 0 6= * 2 R. Claim 7 [5] No skewed squeeze field has a potential. In a skewed squeeze field, it is easy to find a circular path along which the work integral is non-zero (e.g., along a circle with center on the squeeze line). Claim 8 [5] A skewed field induces no stable equilibrium on a disk-shaped <p> Claim 7 <ref> [5] </ref> No skewed squeeze field has a potential. In a skewed squeeze field, it is easy to find a circular path along which the work integral is non-zero (e.g., along a circle with center on the squeeze line). Claim 8 [5] A skewed field induces no stable equilibrium on a disk-shaped part (for all * 6= 0). Force equilibrium is only possible if the center of the disk coincides with the squeeze line. In this position the disk experiences a non-zero moment if * 6= 0. <p> In this position the disk experiences a non-zero moment if * 6= 0. Claim 9 A diagonally skewed field (* = 1) induces no stable equilibrium on a square-shaped part. For a proof see <ref> [5] </ref>. Task: Rotating Parts According to Claims 8 and 9, certain parts will rotate indefinitely in skewed squeeze fields (Figure 16). <p> During the experiments of approximately 10 min, several full rotations of the part were performed. 4.3 Radial Fields Definition 10 A radial field f is a two-dimensional force vector field such that f (z) = z=jzj if z 6= 0, and f (0) = 0. Claim 11 <ref> [5] </ref> A radial field has a potential, U (z) = jzj. Claim 12 [5] Given a polygonal part P in a radial field f , there exists a unique pivot point v of P such that P is in equilibrium if and only if v coincides with the center of the <p> Claim 11 <ref> [5] </ref> A radial field has a potential, U (z) = jzj. Claim 12 [5] Given a polygonal part P in a radial field f , there exists a unique pivot point v of P such that P is in equilibrium if and only if v coincides with the center of the radial field. Claim 13 [5] Let P be a polygonal part with n <p> Claim 12 <ref> [5] </ref> Given a polygonal part P in a radial field f , there exists a unique pivot point v of P such that P is in equilibrium if and only if v coincides with the center of the radial field. Claim 13 [5] Let P be a polygonal part with n vertices, and let k be the maximum number of edges that a bisector of P can cross. <p> There are at most E = O (kn) stable equilibria in a field of the form R + ffiS if S is a squeeze field, and ffi is sufficiently small and positive. Proofs of the previous claims, and a numerical algorithm to compute the pivot point is given in <ref> [5] </ref>. Note that Claim 13 results in strategies for unique part posing in O (E 2 ) = O (k 2 n 2 ) steps. Task: Centering Parts Radial fields can be used to center a part. <p> More complex tasks such as centering or unique orienting require increasingly complex fields. However, planning complexity is e.g. higher for sequences of squeeze fields, and lower for the more complex combined radial + squeeze fields (for a thorough discussion of these fields see <ref> [5] </ref>). This illustrates a tradeoff between mechanical complexity (the dexterity and controllability of actuator arrray elements) and computational complexity (the algorithmic difficulty of synthesizing a strategy). <p> In a stable equilibrium, the part's major principal axis of inertia lines up with the squeeze line to minimize the second moment of inertia [3]. We have proposed a combined radial + "gravitational" field R + ffiG which might have the UFO property <ref> [5] </ref>. Such a field could be obtained from a tilted MEMS array that implements a radial field. Extensive simulations show that for every part we have tried, one unique total equilibrium is always obtained. We are working toward a rigorous proof of this experimental observation.

Reference-contexts: We define the squeeze function as this mapping from original orientation to equilibrium orientation. Hence, from Claim 4 it follows that the image of the squeeze function is a set of E discrete values. Given such a squeeze function, Goldberg has presented an algorithm for sensorless manipulation of polygons <ref> [12] </ref> that constructs an orienting strategy with O (E) steps in O (E 2 ) time. The output of this algorithm is a sequence of squeeze directions. <p> The output of this algorithm is a sequence of squeeze directions. When the corresponding squeeze fields are applied to the part P , the set of possible orientations is successively reduced until a unique orientation (up to symmetry) is reached.

Parts may exhibit several equilibria, hence after one squeeze the part orientation may be ambiguous.

Reference-contexts: describe two different types of actuator arrays: single-crystal silicon (SCS) electrostatic actuators, and combined thermobimorph and electrostatic organic micro cilia. 2.1 Single-Crystal Silicon Electrostatic Actuators The M-Chip (Manipulation Chip, see Figure 3) is fabricated using a Scream (Single-Crystal Silicon Reactive Etching and Metallization) process developed in the Cornell Nanofabrication Facility <ref> [22, 20] </ref>. The Scream process is low-temperature, and does not interfere with traditional VLSI [19]. Hence it opens the door to building monolithic microelectromechanical systems with integrated microactuators and control circuitry on the same wafer. The design is based on microfabricated torsional resonators [16, 15].

Reference-contexts: Each cilium is 430 m long and bends up to 120 m out of the plane. at the Center for Integrated Systems, Stanford University) was designed to be compatible with CMOS or BiCMOS circuits which could be pre-fabricated on a silicon substrate <ref> [21] </ref>. Actuator Cilia. Each cilium consists of two layers of polyimide with different thermal expansion coefficients. The cilium also contains a Titanium-Tungsten (Ti:W) resistive heater loop for thermal actuation, Aluminum electrodes for electrostatic (low-power) hold-down, and a silicon nitride encapsulation/stiffening layer (Figure 8). <p> Each cilium consists of two layers of polyimide with different thermal expansion coefficients.

For a detailed description of the fabrication process see <ref> [21] </ref>. Vertical and horizontal displacements of the cilia tips are a function of the thermal mismatch in the actuator layers. For room temperature, these values can be calculated as ffi v 120 m and ffi h 20 m [21]. Inspection under the scanning electron microscope (SEM) has verified these calculations. <p> For a detailed description of the fabrication process see <ref> [21] </ref>.

The lifting capacity of an actuator can be estimated as the force required to deflect the actuator's tip to the substrate.

Reference-contexts: In Section 4 we present several force vector fields that possess the feeding property. Some of these fields are more powerful part feeders, as they allow the choice of a specific output configuration q. Our work on programmable vector fields is related to nonprehensile manipulation <ref> [8, 23, 9] </ref>: in both cases, parts are manipulated without form or force closure.
