Abstract: This paper presents the results of the development of an autonomous mobile robot, designed according to some new concepts established in this field during the last decade. These principles can be found in other work based on the constructivist approach, artificial life, subsumption architecture and other bottom-up methodologies. These ideas have been applied to the complete robot design, spanning from the shape of the robot to the sensors, from the electronics to the software control structure. By this way we have developed what we call an "Application Specific Mobile Robot" (ASMR). The target application is a domestic autonomous vacuum cleaner. Despite the actual limitations of the final robot, this work shows how this methodology can bring many interesting results.

Reference-contexts: In the last decade, new approaches have tried to bring "artificial intelligence" (AI) and the computer science community back to the real world to get better results in the field of autonomous mobile robotics <ref> [Brooks, 1990] </ref>. This field needs smart systems that are well adapted to their environment through their shapes, sensors, actuators and behaviors. The embodiment [Brooks and Lynn, 1993] of the system is important and brings a new and complex dimension to the problem of artificial intelligence.

Reference-contexts: The creation of a map is a well-studied subject in mobile robotics. Many interesting methods are described by <ref> [Holenstein, 1992] </ref> and [Knieriemen, 1991]. The major problem of creating a map is to keep it coherent. Primarily, it must contain all obstacles, the exact position is secondary. It is more important that the relative positions of the obstacles are right.

Reference-contexts: In case of a lack of memory or a much 11 bigger surface, it is possible to reduce the amount of memory by combining areas of surfaces without obstacles. A common method is called "Quadtree" <ref> [Hoppen, 1992] </ref>. 3.3.2 List representation To facilitate some of the implemented algorithms, the robot also creates a list for each class of obstacles. In our implementation, the robot uses four lists, each containing specific attributes.

Reference-contexts: This procedure is much simpler and faster than to memorize a complex obstacle with a polygonal representation. In addition, the bitmap approach also permits some interesting algorithms for the navigation <ref> [Jarvis, 1993] </ref> and especially the cleaning of the open surface (section 4). The implemented map uses pixels of 2 cm by 2 cm. Using 8 values for a pixel requires only about 245 kilobytes of memory for a surface of 100 m 2 .

Reference-contexts: In addition to its mechanical structure, this robot has the advantage of a modular structure that is easy to modify and extend. Moreover, the CPU and the BIOS of this robot are compatible with the "Khepera" miniature mobile robot <ref> [Mondada et al., 1994] </ref>, used by more than 100 universities and for which a lot of software has been written. The Koala has a square shape and measures about 30 cm by 30 cm. With its dimensions, the Koala fits the application of an autonomous vacuum cleaner.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the robot has no initial map of the environment as it would be too expensive to program a map for each customer. Also the possibility that the customer himself programs the map must be excluded. 2 "Application Specific Mobile Robot" (ASMR) 2.1 Basic principles Despite a demanding market <ref> [Pellerin, 1995] </ref>, only few cleaning robots have been developed until now [Schofield, 1995] and many companies went out of business trying to develop new products for this domain [T.

Reference-contexts: Domestic environments are mostly unstructured and often very complex, much more than the industrial environment where some cleaning robots are already being used <ref> [Schofield, 1995] </ref>. Moreover, this application sets some important constrains for the size, the self-sufficiency, the efficiency and the autonomy of the robot. To get a satisfying cleaning job, we define that the robot has to cover at least 90% of the open surface. <p> Also the possibility that the customer himself programs the map must be excluded. 2 "Application Specific Mobile Robot" (ASMR) 2.1 Basic principles Despite a demanding market [Pellerin, 1995], only few cleaning robots have been developed until now <ref> [Schofield, 1995] </ref> and many companies went out of business trying to develop new products for this domain [T. Gomi, personal communication 1995]. A new approach must be followed to design an autonomous vacuum cleaner working in an unknown and unstructured environment.

Reference-contexts: Many companies and research institutions have tried to develop such a robot, with only few results. The human operator can not be replaced easily by "artificial intelligence" <ref> [Schraft et al., 1994, Schofield and Grunke, 1994] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: As Steels explains very well <ref> [Steels, 1995] </ref>, autonomy is not simply composed by a set of smart rules, but is the ability to create its own rules. To move around, finding a path or doing a job like cleaning seems very simple for us and for many animals.

Reference-contexts: In addition, tactile sensors are low cost, easy to implement and especially very reliable. Especially this last point, the reliability, is a big advantage in unstructured and unknown environments <ref> [Yamamoto, 1993] </ref>[Rucci and Dario, 1994]. We designed a low cost tactile sensor system consisting of plug pins and a metal plate in the shape of a comb (figure 6). The plate is fixed vertically around the cleaning head.
