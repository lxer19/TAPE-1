Title: Meta-Rule-Guided Mining of Association Rules in Relational Databases  
Author: Yongjian Fu Jiawei Han 
Address: Canada  
Affiliation: School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University,  
Abstract: A meta-rule-guided data mining approach is proposed and studied which applies meta-rules as a guidance at finding multiple-level association rules in large relational databases. A meta-rule is a rule template in the form of "P 1 ^ ^ P m ! Q 1 ^ ^Q n ", in which some of the predicates (and/or their variables) in the antecedent and/or consequent of the meta-rule could be instantiated. The rule template is used to describe what forms of rules are expected to be found from the database, and such a rule template is used as a guidance or constraint in the data mining process. Note that the predicate variables in a meta-rule can be instantiated against a database schema, whereas the variables or some high-level constants inside a predicate can be bound to multiple (but more specific) levels of concepts in the corresponding conceptual hierarchies. The concrete rules at different concept levels are discovered by a progressive deepening data mining technique similar to that developed in our study of mining multiple-level association rules. Two algorithms are developed along this line and a performance study is conducted to compare their relative efficiencies. Our experimental and performance studies demonstrate that the method is powerful and efficient in data mining from large databases.

Reference-contexts: In this study, we assume that multiple levels of concepts are organized in the form of concept hierarchies which are provided in the system for mining rules at multiple concept levels, however, the concept hierarchies can also be dynamically adjusted and/or automatically generated for flexible data mining <ref> [5] </ref>. To confine our study, we assume the rules to be discovered are conjunctive rules, i.e., a set of conjuncts in both the rule head and body. Moreover, the predicate variable in the meta-rules can only be instantiated against database schema (attributes).

Reference-contexts: Based on our observation, the scope of metaquery-directed mining could be substantially extended if the discovery of rules at multiple concept levels is explored <ref> [6] </ref>. Moreover, since a metaquery and its instantiated rules are in the form of association rules, the performance could be substantially enhanced if the database-oriented association rule mining algorithms [2] are adopted in the data mining process. <p> For efficient mining of multiple-level single-variable association rules, two techniques: a large-predicate growing technique and a p-predicate testing technique, are proposed and examined in the next two subsections. 3.1 A large-predicate growing technique Following our previous study on mining multiple-level association rules <ref> [6] </ref>, a large-predicate growing technique is proposed as follows. First, the set of relevant data is collected into an initial data relation by executing an SQL query specified by the data mining query. <p> set tables L [l; p] if the confidence of the rule is no less than minconf [l], the specified confidence threshold at this level. 2 3.2 A direct p-predicate testing technique The previous algorithm is a natural extension of the method developed in the study of mining multiple-level association rules <ref> [6] </ref>. A major difference of the requirements in meta-rule guided mining from that in the mining of general multiple-level association rules is that p, the number of large predicates in the rules to be generated, is predefined by the given meta-rule. <p> Thus the transaction-based data mining algorithms developed in previous studies <ref> [2, 6] </ref> can be applied in the efficient processing of association relationships. However, the previously developed transaction-based association rule mining algorithms still need to be modified to accommodate more complicated queries. 6 Conclusions We studied the meta-rule guided mining of multiple-level association rules in large relational databases.

Reference-contexts: The first problem, the lack of focus on the set of data to be studied, can be handled by introducing a data mining interface which specifies the set of data relevant to a particular mining task. For example, the DBMiner (previously DBLearn) system developed in our previous study <ref> [7] </ref> uses an SQL-like interface to specify the task-relevant set of data for a data mining query. Thus, in order to find the general characteristics of computer science graduate students in Canada, a where-clause is used to retrieve only those students of interest. <p> There are many ways to specify the kinds of knowledge or the forms of rules to be discovered. For example, one may specify the types of knowledge to be discovered, such as characteristic rules, classification rules, association rules, and so on <ref> [7] </ref>, or specify the number of disjuncts in a generalized rule, i.e., the expected (or maximum) number of distinct values of each generalized attribute or the number of tuples in the generalized relation [4]. <p> For effective data mining, a particular user is usually interested in only a subset of the data stored in a large database. An SQL-like data mining query <ref> [7] </ref> submitted to a data mining system should be first transformed into two portions: a data collection portion and a knowledge discovery portion. The former is essentially an SQL-query which will be executed against the database to collect the interested set of data.
