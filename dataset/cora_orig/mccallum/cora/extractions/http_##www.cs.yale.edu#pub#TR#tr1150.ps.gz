Reference-contexts: As indicated earlier, the search data can be considered a total area effect. Similar results have been reported in visual search tasks using a sequence of scaled ellipses (Tries-man and Gelade, 1980), as well as in apparent motion <ref> (Anstis, 1978) </ref>. The visual search paradigm confounds such area effects with the effects of where shocks form; i.e., with the 20 for Experiment I (left) and Experiment II (right). 21 which the target and distractors are interchanged (right). analysis of their spatial positions.

Reference-contexts: Given the tremendous variation across different stimulus sets, how can the body of performance data be compared? Existing volumetric theories for basic level recognition, e.g. those based on geons <ref> (Biederman, 1987) </ref>, are applicable to some of these images but not others, while feature-based approaches achieve generality only by using local structure that is restricted to a specific image class (following normalization).

Reference-contexts: Medial axis style representations of shape have been popular for several decades as a candidate description, in part because they carry both qualitative as well as quantitative information. Blum placed an emphasis on the former type of information early on in his classic work on axis-morphologies <ref> (Blum, 1973) </ref>, where he attempted to interpret 25 on the data averaged over the two observers in (Burbeck et al., 1996) (dashed lines).

Reference-contexts: Such a model is consistent with psychophysical data obtained for certain classes of unfamiliar objects <ref> (Bulthoff et al., 1995) </ref>, but its extension to more complex domains is non-trivial.

Reference-contexts: Underlying its formulation is the hypothesis that the scale at which the human visual system integrates local boundary information towards the formation of more global object representations is proportional to object width. Psychophysical examinations of Weber's Law for separation discrimination support this proposal <ref> (Burbeck and Hadden, 1993) </ref>. Arguing that the same mechanism explains the attenuation of edge modulation effects with width, Burbeck et al. have recently described a set of psychophysical experiments where subjects were required to bisect elongated stimuli with wiggly sides (Burbeck et al., 1996).

Reference-contexts: We expect that such geometric properties are dominant only when the qualitative shock structure is preserved, as is the case along the bends-protrusions axis where there is a uniform addition of mass. Observe that these shapes closely resemble wiggles <ref> (Burbeck et al., 1996) </ref>. For thin objects placed close to the bends node the central axis is seen to wiggle, for thicker objects placed close to the protrusions node the central axis is perceived to be straight. <p> In Section 2 we use a visual search paradigm to test the first hypothesis, which is related to "when"-dominated perceptual effects. In Section 3 we review the psychophysical experiments of <ref> (Burbeck et al., 1996) </ref>, in which subjects were required to bisect wiggle like stimuli. We demonstrate that the results are consistent with our second hypothesis, which is related to "where"-dominated effects. <p> What is required is a task that is normalized with respect to area, and this is precisely the case for one class of experiments conducted by Burbeck and Pizer <ref> (Burbeck et al., 1996) </ref>. Although their motivation was quite different from ours theoretically, it is pleasing that the elongated stimuli with sinusoidal edge modulation they used (wiggles) closely resemble members of the bends-protrusions sequence in Figure 14. <p> Observe that these shapes appear to be not only uniformly thickened but also increasingly straightened versions of one another. In the following Section we review the experiments of <ref> (Burbeck et al., 1996) </ref>, and provide evidence in favor of our second hypothesis that the perceived straightening is related to the loci of high-order shocks. 3 The Effects of "Where" Shocks Form Pizer etal. (Morse et al., 1994; Burbeck and Pizer, 1995; Burbeck et al., 1996) have developed an alternative approach <p> Arguing that the same mechanism explains the attenuation of edge modulation effects with width, Burbeck et al. have recently described a set of psychophysical experiments where subjects were required to bisect elongated stimuli with wiggly sides <ref> (Burbeck et al., 1996) </ref>. These stimuli closely resemble shapes from the bends-protrusions sequence in Figure 14. <p> Burbeck and Pizer quantified this effect of edge modulation on the perceived center by varying the horizontal position of the probe dot and subjecting the data to probit analysis. The center of the object was inferred as the 50% point on the best-fitting probit function 3 , 2 See <ref> (Burbeck et al., 1996) </ref> for further details. 3 The location at which a subject is statistically equally likely to judge the probe dot to be to the left or 23 a. b. c. d. in (Burbeck et al., 1996), computed using the algorithm in (Siddiqi and Kimia, 1996). a) 0.75 degree <p> was inferred as the 50% point on the best-fitting probit function 3 , 2 See <ref> (Burbeck et al., 1996) </ref> for further details. 3 The location at which a subject is statistically equally likely to judge the probe dot to be to the left or 23 a. b. c. d. in (Burbeck et al., 1996), computed using the algorithm in (Siddiqi and Kimia, 1996). a) 0.75 degree width, 0.25 cycles/degree edge modulation; b) 0.75 degree object, 2.0 cycles/degree edge modulation; c) 1.5 degree object, 0.25 cycles/degree edge modulation; d) 1.5 degree object, 2.0 cycles/degree edge modulation. and the bisection threshold was defined <p> Thus in the following section we compare computational results obtained from shock-based descriptions with observer data from <ref> (Burbeck et al., 1996) </ref>. 3.2 Analysis and Discussion We computed shock-based representations for all 24 wiggles using the algorithm in (Siddiqi and Kimia, 1996). Results for selected stimuli are shown in Figure 25, with the geometry to the right of the object's center. 24 labeled (all other shocks are first-order). <p> Note that the fourth-order shocks are in alignment with the sinusoidal peaks. of the high-order shocks explained in Figure 26. As evidence in support of our hypothesis, consider the computed central modulations overlaid as solid lines on the original observer data taken from <ref> (Burbeck et al., 1996) </ref>, in Figure 27. The predicted central modulations are clearly consistent with an "average" observer's data. <p> This property is also reflected in the "bisection-threshold" or variance of the perceived centers in <ref> (Burbeck et al., 1996) </ref>. Underlying this notion is the concept that the scale at which boundaries should interact to form more global object models is proportional to the spatial extent across which they communicate. 4 General Discussion The problem of shape representation is an extremely subtle one. <p> Blum placed an emphasis on the former type of information early on in his classic work on axis-morphologies (Blum, 1973), where he attempted to interpret 25 on the data averaged over the two observers in <ref> (Burbeck et al., 1996) </ref> (dashed lines). The central modulations are expressed as a percentage of the edge modulation amplitude and are plotted against edge modulation frequency for amplitudes of 20% of the object width (left) and 40% of the object width (right).

Reference-contexts: The curve C, evolving according to equation (1), is then obtained as the zero level set of . A convenient choice for is the signed distance function to the shape, which can be computed efficiently <ref> (Danielsson, 1980) </ref>. The real-valued embedding surface also provides high resolution information for detecting and localizing shocks. In particular, the four shock types can be classified using differential properties of (see Figure 29).

Reference-contexts: For example, in the abstraction hierarchy "furniture, chair, arm-chair", the classifications chair and arm-chair are at basic and subordinate levels, respectively. However, to date no complete theory exists for obtaining such volumetric descriptions from retinal images (except in highly constrained domains) and many computational issues remain to be addressed <ref> (Dickinson et al., 1997) </ref>. Just laying out the mathematical form of such a theory is a significant challenge.

Reference-contexts: We first describe the experiments and then provide a discussion of the results. 2.1 Methods Our experimental procedure closely follows that introduced in <ref> (Elder and Zucker, 1993) </ref>, with only slight modifications. Visual search displays were created on a 60 Hz color SUN monitor, driven by a SPARC 10 computer. Subjects sat in a dimly lit room, 2 meters from the screen. <p> This modification avoids a systematic bias that the traditional method suffers from, and typically gives lower error rates <ref> (Elder and Zucker, 1993) </ref>. 2.2 Subjects Three subjects participated in each of the main experiments in this study (all male). There was sufficient consistency in results so that only one subject was used for the control experiments. Each subject participated voluntarily and reported normal or corrected vision.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, it is possible that both types of representations co-exist, but for orthogonal purposes, i.e., for recognition tasks at different levels of abstraction.

However, total area was preserved only in Experiment II, since mass was added to create the sequences in Figures 9 and 13.

Reference-contexts: When such a deformation alters the topological shock structure sufficiently, new perceptual categories can arise. To order the possibilities, we arrange the earlier sequences along the sides of a shape triangle <ref> (Kimia, 1990) </ref>. Informally, the idea is that the interpretation of each shape lies on a continuum between distinct categories represented by the parts, protrusions and bends nodes, Figure 7. For example, along the parts-bends axis the percept changes from that of 9 to the "parts", "protrusions" and "bends" nodes (Kimia, 1990). <p> triangle <ref> (Kimia, 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The constant ff 0 controls the regularizing effects of curvature . When ff is large, the equation becomes a geometric heat equation which smooths the curve. In this paper we focus on the case where ff = 0, for which the equation is hyperbolic and shocks <ref> (Lax, 1971) </ref>, or entropy-satisfying singularities, 28 can form. The locus of points through which the shocks migrate is related to Blum's grassfire transformation (Brockett and Maragos, 1992; Kimia et al., 1995), although significantly more information is available via a "coloring" of these positions.

Reference-contexts: Most importantly, we know from the theory that, for such simple shapes, the shocks in Figure 2 are the only possible types. In analogy to Leyton's process grammar for shape <ref> (Leyton, 1988) </ref>, the composition of a more complex shape from these shock types is characterized by a small number of rewrite rules (Siddiqi et al., 1998).

Reference-contexts: A typical computational account of this process provides a description of each stored view as a vector of image features; the vector of observed image features is then compared with the nearest stored views using a regularization network <ref> (Poggio and Edelman, 1990) </ref>. Such a model is consistent with psychophysical data obtained for certain classes of unfamiliar objects (Bulthoff et al., 1995), but its extension to more complex domains is non-trivial.

Reference-contexts: It also structures the organization of knowledge about objects in our world into abstraction hierarchies, as is required for efficient computational access to memory. As observed by Rosch <ref> (Rosch, 1978) </ref>: ...the world consists of a virtually infinite number of discriminably different stimuli. Since no organism can cope with infinite diversity, one of the most basic functions of all organisms is the cutting up of the environment into classifica tions by which nonidentical stimuli can be treated as equivalent...

Reference-contexts: We have provided several examples to support the 26 argument that generic recognition is mediated by the topology of the skeletal branches, while subordinate level differences are based primarily on their geometry (Section 1). However, topological information is known to be sensitive to boundary noise <ref> (Serra, 1982) </ref>, a property at odds with requirements for generic recognition. To complicate matters, variations on the skeleton theme, such as the core model (Morse et al., 1994; Burbeck and Pizer, 1995; Burbeck et al., 1996) introduce new issues of scale.

Reference-contexts: Note the structural description of the shape as two parts connected at a neck, with each part described by three protrusions merging onto a seed. Adapted from <ref> (Siddiqi and Kimia, 1996) </ref>. contour of an object (Kimia et al., 1995). Four types of shocks arise, each of which has a direct perceptual correlate, as illustrated in Figure 2. <p> These were computed using the algorithm developed in <ref> (Siddiqi and Kimia, 1996) </ref>. 2-shocks occur at (local) minima in object width, 3-shocks at regions of constant width and 4-shocks at (local) maxima in width, as indicated by the inscribed discs, see Appendix A. <p> probit function 3 , 2 See (Burbeck et al., 1996) for further details. 3 The location at which a subject is statistically equally likely to judge the probe dot to be to the left or 23 a. b. c. d. in (Burbeck et al., 1996), computed using the algorithm in <ref> (Siddiqi and Kimia, 1996) </ref>. a) 0.75 degree width, 0.25 cycles/degree edge modulation; b) 0.75 degree object, 2.0 cycles/degree edge modulation; c) 1.5 degree object, 0.25 cycles/degree edge modulation; d) 1.5 degree object, 2.0 cycles/degree edge modulation. and the bisection threshold was defined as the variance of this function. <p> Thus in the following section we compare computational results obtained from shock-based descriptions with observer data from (Burbeck et al., 1996). 3.2 Analysis and Discussion We computed shock-based representations for all 24 wiggles using the algorithm in <ref> (Siddiqi and Kimia, 1996) </ref>. Results for selected stimuli are shown in Figure 25, with the geometry to the right of the object's center. 24 labeled (all other shocks are first-order). Note that the fourth-order shocks are in alignment with the sinusoidal peaks. of the high-order shocks explained in Figure 26. <p> The real-valued embedding surface also provides high resolution information for detecting and localizing shocks. In particular, the four shock types can be classified using differential properties of (see Figure 29). These ideas have been developed to provide an algorithm for shock detection <ref> (Siddiqi and Kimia, 1996) </ref>, which was used to compute the shock-based descriptions in Figures 3, 4 and 25. An abstraction into a graph of shock groups provides a structural description for shape matching using graph theory (Siddiqi et al., 1998; Pelillo et al., 1998), see Figure 5. <p> Bottom Left: A set of third-order shocks forms along the central axis of the worm shape, where 1 2 = jrj = 0. Bottom Right: A fourth-order shock forms in the center of the circle shape, where 1 2 &gt; 0 and jrj = 0. Adapted from <ref> (Siddiqi and Kimia, 1996) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In analogy to Leyton's process grammar for shape (Leyton, 1988), the composition of a more complex shape from these shock types is characterized by a small number of rewrite rules <ref> (Siddiqi et al., 1998) </ref>. The stimuli provide a class of parametrically ordered shapes which can be used for psychophysical studies: the parts-protrusions and bends-protrusions sequences were created by adding material to each side; the parts-bends sequence was created by shearing the left boundary with respect to the right one.

Reference-contexts: This is consistent with findings that, in the human visual system, the degree of generalization to novel views when three-dimensional objects undergo deformations is primarily dependent on the amount of deformation in the image-plane <ref> (Sklar et al., 1993) </ref>. We focus on this necessary part of the description, and begin by considering 2D shapes, and deformations of their boundaries.

Reference-contexts: Note that the method differs from traditional approaches, in which only half of the displays actually contain a target, and one of two mouse buttons is pressed depending upon whether the subject perceives the target to be present or absent <ref> (Triesman and Gelade, 1980) </ref>. This modification avoids a systematic bias that the traditional method suffers from, and typically gives lower error rates (Elder and Zucker, 1993). 2.2 Subjects Three subjects participated in each of the main experiments in this study (all male).
