Reference-contexts: This problem is an extension or combination of problems that have been considered in several contexts. Classical pursuit-evasion games express differential motion models for two opponents, and conditions of capture or optimal strategies are sought <ref> [1] </ref>. For example, in the classical Homicidal Chauffeur game, conditions of inevitable collision can be expressed in terms of the non-holonomic turning-radius constraints of the pursuer and evader. Although interesting decision problems arise through the differential motion models, geometric free-space constraints are traditionally not considered in classical pursuit-evasion games.

Reference-contexts: Several interesting results have been obtained for pursuit-evasion in a graph, in which the pursuers and evader can move from vertex to vertex until eventually a pursuer and evader lie in the same vertex <ref> [2, 4] </ref>. However, the visibility polygon along with motions in a free space add geometric information that must be utilized, and also leads to connections with the static art gallery problems [3].

Reference-contexts: However, the visibility polygon along with motions in a free space add geometric information that must be utilized, and also leads to connections with the static art gallery problems <ref> [3] </ref>. In the limiting case, art gallery results serve as a loose upper bound on the number of pursuers by allowing a covering of the free space by static guards, guaranteeing that any evader will be immediately visible.

However, the visibility polygon along with motions in a free space add geometric information that must be utilized, and also leads to connections with the static art gallery problems [3]. <p> Figure 2 shows a simply-connected free space that requires an extra pursuer for each level in a tree of corridors. This example is inspired from a related graph-searching problem for which Parsons <ref> [4] </ref> gives a necessary and sufficient condition for determining when n + 1 pursuers are needed, given that the graph contains three subgraphs that each require n pursuers.

Reference-contexts: One interesting task is to formulate bounds on H over certain classes of free spaces. We have presently determined tight bounds for the case of a simply-connected free space, and are currently investigating the multiply-connected case. In <ref> [5] </ref> a class of simple polygons is identified for which a single pursuer suffices. For a simply-connected free space F , at worst H (F ) = O (lg n), in which n is the complexity of the environment.
