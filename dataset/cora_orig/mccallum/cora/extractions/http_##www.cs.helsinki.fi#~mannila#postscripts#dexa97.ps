Abstract: We introduce a methodology for knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) where one first discovers large collections of patterns at once, and then performs interactively retrieves subsets of the collection of patterns. The proposed methodology suits such KDD formalisms as association and episode rules, where large collections of potentially interesting rules can be found efficiently. We present methods that support interactive exploration of large collections of rules. With these methods the user can flexibly specify the focus of interest, and also iteratively refine it. We have implemented our methodology in the Tasa system which discovers patterns in telecommunication alarm databases. In this paper, we give concrete examples of how to use frequent patterns in the construction of alarm correlation expert systems.

Reference-contexts: In the correlation patterns, delays are handled with a special wait function. Episode and association rules can be applied in this system in a rather straightforward way. The episode rule IF link alarm &lt; link failure THEN high fault rate WITH <ref> [5] </ref> [60] conf (0.70) freq (700/1000) discovered by Tasa can be coded in the system as fol lows: if "alarm type = link alarm" then start time; wait until "alarm type = link failure" or "time = 5 sec"; if "alarm type = link failure" then display warning "high fault rate

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that sometimes considerable amounts of rules remain, even when the user has found the desired focus with the described methods. Automatic pruning, sorting, and structuring methods should at this point be available for invocation by the user, especially for removal of redundancy; see, e.g., <ref> [15] </ref> for rule covers, statistical methods, and clustering. 5 Application Experience Tasa has been in prototype use in four telecommunication companies since the beginning of 1995, and experiences are encouraging.
