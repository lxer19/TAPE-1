Title: Experiences with EGRET: An Exploratory Group Work Environment

Abstract: Exploratory collaboration occurs in domains where the structure and process of group work evolves as an intrinsic part of the collaborative activity. Traditional database and hypertext structural models do not provide explicit support for collaborative exploration. EGRET is an implemented environment for the development of domainspecific collaborative systems that defines a novel data and a process model along with services for exploratory collaboration. To accomplish this, EGRET departs from traditional notions of the relationship between schema and instance structure. In EGRET, schema structure is viewed as a representation of the current state of consensus among collaborators, from which instance structure is allowed to depart in a controlled fashion. To provide such exploratory services in a responsive interactive environment, EGRET implements specialized architectural mechanisms. This paper presents the concepts and implications of exploratory collaboration, followed by the design and implementation of EGRET. The paper concludes with our results to date, which demonstrate that EGRET succeeds in providing useful services for exploratory collaboration, through interesting technical and cultural issues remain to be addressed before exploratory collaboration can become commonplace in CSCW systems. This paper is a revised and extended version of Supporting Exploratory CSCW with the EGRET Framework, which appeared in the Proceedings of the 1992 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, Toronto, Canada. This paper also contains excerpts from "An Architectural Perspective on Egret", from the Proceedings of the 1992 CSCW Tools and Technologies Workshop, Toronto, CA.

Reference-contexts: Support for collaboration in traditional databases and hypertext systems typically involves traditional concurrency control, transaction management, and versioning facilities. EGRET simply "passes on" these facilities from its underlying database server mechanism to the user. The contexts mechanism <ref> (Delisle, 1987) </ref> for providing logical workspaces comes close to our concerns, yet these workspaces do not allow structural exploration of the form supported in EGRET. There has been some work on extensible CSCW systems, for example (Mackay, 1990; Shepherd, 1990).

Reference-contexts: The paper ends with a summary of conclusions and our future directions. 2 EXPLORATORY COLLABORATION In <ref> (Giddings, 1984) </ref>, exploratory domains are characterized as experimental and embedded. Experimental means that the appropriate structure and process for problem solving in the domain cannot be well determined except through experimentation with a variety of techniques.

Reference-contexts: There has been some work on extensible CSCW systems, for example (Mackay, 1990; Shepherd, 1990). However, these systems do not attempt explicit data and process model support for representational exploration and change: in an important sense, the extensibility occurs outside of the system. The Object Lens system <ref> (Lee, 1990) </ref> allows different sites build first class, yet inconsistent schema-level structures. To support communication between sites, mappings must be defined that transform instances of one structure at one site into their analogous form at other sites.

Reference-contexts: Like exploratory activities in general at this point in time, EGRET will not scale well to hundreds of workers manipulating millions of artifacts, despite our architectural innovations. 6 RESULTS The first version of EGRET was implemented in the Fall of 1991 using Unix, X windows, Epoch <ref> (Love, 1992) </ref>, and the HyperBase database server (Wiil, 1990). Much of the user interface-level features of EGRET, such as multiple fonts, colors, and windows; read-only regions; multiuser support via clientserver processing across ethernet; locking; and so forth were provided by this palette of platforms.

Reference-contexts: During the past year, we designed and implemented a system called DSB (Ram, 1993) that automatically extracts and documents the objectoriented structure of EGRET (and its other domainspecific applications discussed below) from the source code itself. Future research plans include re-implementing the Designbase to interface to DSB directly. CLARE <ref> (Wan, 1993) </ref> is a system designed to support collaborative learning. It supports a theory of collaborative learning involving specific phases (summarization, argumentation, evaluation, integration), during which specific EGRET node types (evidence, claim, theory, etc.) are created and manipulated.
