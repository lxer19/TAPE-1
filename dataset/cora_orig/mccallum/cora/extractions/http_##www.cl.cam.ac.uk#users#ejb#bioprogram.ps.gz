Title: Language Acquisition: the Bioprogram Hypothesis and the Baldwin Effect

Abstract: An extended account of grammatical acquisition is developed within a parameter-setting framework applied to Generalized Categorial Grammar (GCG). GCG is embedded in a default inheritance hierarchy yielding a natural partial ordering (reflecting generality) of parameters which is used to determine setting order. Several resulting learning procedures are effective on a grammar/language set expressing major typological distinctions based on constituent order. In an evolutionary simulation, language agents quasi-randomly instantiating such learning procedures are selected for on the basis of language learning success. Given specified conditions during the evolution of the human language faculty, the simulation predicts learners with a higher proportion of default (unmarked) initial parameter settings will be selected, lending some support to Bickerton's Bioprogram Hypothesis as a general case of the Baldwin Effect. 1

Reference-contexts: The Bioprogram Hypothesis is generally considered controversial even by those linguists who accept that language acquisition is partially guided by an innate language faculty or language acquisition device <ref> (e.g. Aitchison, 1996) </ref>. However, in this paper I argue that, once innateness is accepted, genetic assimilation makes some language bioprogram the most likely outcome of the evolutionary development of the language acquisition device.

Reference-contexts: A parameter is updated on parse failure and, if this results in a parse, the new setting is retained. The algorithm is summarized in Figure 12. Working memory grows through childhood <ref> (e.g. Baddeley, 1992) </ref>, and such restrictions may assist learning by ensuring that trigger sentences gradually increase in complexity through the acquisition period (e.g. Elman, 1991) by forcing the learner to ignore more complex potential triggers that occur early in the learning process.

Reference-contexts: From the perspective of the parameters framework, the Bioprogram Hypothesis claims that children are endowed genetically with a UG which, by default, 3 specifies the stereotypical core creole grammar, with right-branching syntax and subject-verb-object order, as in Saramaccan <ref> (Bickerton, 1984) </ref>. Others working within the parameters framework have proposed default-valued or unmarked parameters (e.g. Lightfoot, 1991), but the Bioprogram Hypothesis can be interpreted as towards one end of a continuum of proposals ranging from all parameters initially unset to all set to default values.

Reference-contexts: GCG as presented is inadequate as an account of UG or of any individual grammar. In particular, the definition of atomic categories needs extending to deal with featural variation <ref> (e.g. Bouma and van Noord, 1994) </ref>, and the rule schemata, especially composition and weak permutation, must be restricted in various parametric ways so that overgeneration is prevented for specific languages (e.g. Morrill, 1994).

Reference-contexts: I try to address these criticisms by proposing a modified parameter setting procedure which can learn more complex grammars than those investigated by Gibson and Clark (1994) and which is more directed and therefore less psychologically implausible than the Markovian `memoryless' procedures of the type investigated by Gibson and Clark <ref> (Brent, 1996) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: SOVv2 is slightly lower on the WML ranking than SOV (largely because the freer constituent ordering options of Japanese relative to German are not modelled effectively in "Japanese" and "German" <ref> (see Hawkins, 1994) </ref>). Figure 24 shows the languages which emerge during one run with memory limitations enabled. SOVv2 comes to dominate the population after 5 interaction cycles.
