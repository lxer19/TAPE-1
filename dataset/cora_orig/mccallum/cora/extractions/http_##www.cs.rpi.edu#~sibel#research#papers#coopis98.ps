Reference-contexts: Such a method was developed for boolean queries in [9]. In this paper, we propose a generic and customizable mechanism for arbitrary attributes, modifiers and con-nectives. The query transformation methods can be integrated into mediated systems like the Hermes system <ref> [4] </ref> by adding an information pooling capability that expands predefined resource queries to its possible (relaxed) rewritings at query execution time.

Reference-contexts: In this approach, information sources are queried using the attributes of the objects being retrieved from them. This approach has been used with great success in retrieving structured and semi-structured objects using various query rewriting methods <ref> [5, 6, 19, 22] </ref>. However, multimedia objects are usually queried using combinations of pre-defined functions that are not based on a particular schema. In an alternate approach, information sources are queried using pre defined queries, i.e. functions, that map certain search parameters to sets of objects.

Reference-contexts: Confluence is a necessary condition of Church-Rosser systems. It is not possible to obtain a linear membership algorithm without confluence. It is shown by Book and Otto <ref> [7] </ref> that confluence is decidable for any finite string-rewriting system whose reduction relation is noetherian. (A reduction relation ! R on fl is noetherian if there is no infinite sequence x 0 ; x 1 ; : : : 2 fl such that for all i 0; x i ! R <p> The problem of determining whether a finite string-rewriting system is noetherian or not is undecidable in general. However, it has been shown <ref> [7] </ref> that the following two statements are equivalent: (a) the reduction relation ! R is noetherian; (b) there exists a well-founded partial ordering OE on fl such that r OE l holds for each rule l ! R r. <p> The simplest such function is the string length function, i.e. w (x) &lt; w (y) if x contains strictly less number of symbols then y. Given a noetherian finite string-rewriting system R, there exists an algorithm to decide whether R is confluent <ref> [7] </ref>. 4 Variations on a Theme of Query Weight In this section, we will concentrate on the weight function and discuss how different query transformation methods can be captured in this framework using different weight functions.

Reference-contexts: Such complex domains were first described by Lu, Nerode and Subrahmanian [14] for accessing heterogeneous information sources, and has since been adopted for many different applications, especially for multimedia <ref> [8, 15] </ref>. We finish this section with a function that is used to order structured queries among themselves.

Combining these steps would provide a more directed query reduction mechanism. Many query relaxation methods described in the literature <ref> [8, 10, 15] </ref> use some sort of a partial ordering of attribute values or atoms. These notions of relaxation can be captured easily in our framework. The need to integrate search interfaces was addressed in [13].

Reference-contexts: The desired approach is to map the complete query to the relevant information source. Another possibility is to relax the query to A if the and not connective is not supported by a source. Such a method was developed for boolean queries in <ref> [9] </ref>. In this paper, we propose a generic and customizable mechanism for arbitrary attributes, modifiers and con-nectives. <p> The integration of our matching capabilities with such a structured attribute based query language would provide a powerful hybrid for querying the web. Sound and complete methods for describing query capabilities of and mapping between boolean query engines are discussed in <ref> [9] </ref>. This work is the closest to our method in that it handles both relaxations and structured queries for information retrieval queries. Our work is different from this in two respects.

Reference-contexts: Query rewriting using view definitions have been an active area of research. Many algorithms have been developed in the literature. The most interesting of those were first developed by Qian [21] and later extended by Duschka and Gene-sereth <ref> [12] </ref>. The rewrite rules that contain skolem functions are very similar in effect to the rewrite rules used in our system. We are currently working on extending our results to the problem of query rewriting using such rules in the presence of constraints.

These notions of relaxation can be captured easily in our framework. The need to integrate search interfaces was addressed in <ref> [13] </ref>. As it is pointed out in this paper, most meta search engines tend to support the least common denominator of the capabilities of underlying search engines. An SQL based query language for querying the web was proposed in [16].

Reference-contexts: However, in our case, the answer set of a query is the solu-tion of a complex constraint with respect to a given underlying constraint domain. Such complex domains were first described by Lu, Nerode and Subrahmanian <ref> [14] </ref> for accessing heterogeneous information sources, and has since been adopted for many different applications, especially for multimedia [8, 15].

Reference-contexts: Such conventions may be enforced by the context-free grammar of the flexible interface language. We now define Church-Rosser string rewriting systems. A Church-Rosser system is a semi-Thue string rewriting system, due to R. McNaughton, P. Narendran, and F. Otto <ref> [17] </ref>. Let be a finite alphabet, and let fl denote the set of all strings over . Let w be a weight function w : fl ! NI that maps the strings from fl to natural numbers. A string rewriting system induces binary relations on fl .

They fall between the set of deterministic context-free languages (DCFL) that are rec ognized by deterministic pushdown automata, and context-sensitive languages (CSL) that are recognized by linear bounded automata, i.e. DCFL ae CRL ae CSL.
