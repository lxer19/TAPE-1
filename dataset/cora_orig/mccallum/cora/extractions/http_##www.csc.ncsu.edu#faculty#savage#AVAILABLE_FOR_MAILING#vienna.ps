Abstract: Let F(n) be a family of partitions of n and let F(n; d) denote the set of partitions in F(n) with Durfee square of size d. We define the Durfee polynomial of F(n) to be the polynomial P F;n = P jF(n; d)jy d , where 0 d b p nc: This paper describes ongoing efforts to compute statistics associated with the Durfee polynomial for various families F. We give empirical evidence which leads to the conjecture that for several families F, including unrestricted partitions and partitions into distinct parts, all roots of the Durfee polynomial are real (and negative). It would follow then that for these families the sequence of coefficients fjF(n; d)jg is log-concave and unimodal and, by a result of Darroch, that the mean and the mode of the sequence differ by less than 1. The mean and the mode are, respectively, the average size and the most likely size of the Durfee square of a partition in F(n). Experimentally we have observed that for several families F(n) the mean and mode grow as cn 1=2 , for an appropriate constant c = c F . An empirical method from asymptotic analysis yields analytical expressions for the constants c F which agree numerically with the observed values.

These properties have been studied for many combinatorial sequences <ref> [15, 2] </ref> and in particular for the sequences ff (n; k)g for fixed n, where f (n; k) is the number of partitions of n in F (n) and k is the size of a chosen parameter.

Reference-contexts: Further terms are needed to determine the function f (u), (here we need only g (u)). See <ref> [3] </ref> for a detailed example. When all terms on the right of (2.1) are expanded similarly, substitution of (4.1) into (2.1) yields, after division by common factors, 1 = Q (e v ) + e g 0 with Q (w), R (w) given in (4.2).

Reference-contexts: It is well-known that if all roots of the polynomial P a d x d ; 0 d N are real (and hence negative), then fa d g is strictly log-concave in d and therefore unimodal with a peak or a plateau of two points. (See <ref> [4, 13] </ref>, for example). What is perhaps less well-known is that this condition on the roots guarantees that the mode and the mean of fa d g differ by at most 1 [6, 1].

Reference-contexts: Because the recursion for the numbers on row n involves numbers appearing on rows a constant times d earlier, we see no way to use the often successful technique of <ref> [9] </ref> to prove the Durfee polynomials have all their roots negative. We tested the Durfee polynomials of all the families (1) - (9) and, except for the family Z (first complex root when n = 75), found that all roots are real and negative for n 1000.

Reference-contexts: See also <ref> [10] </ref>. 5 Conclusion All of the partition families (1) - (9) of Section 2 appear to have in common that the sequences fF (n; d)g are strictly log-concave, that jmeanfF (n; d)gmodefF (n; d)gj &lt; 1 and, further, for (1) - (8), that the Durfee polynomial has all roots real.

Reference-contexts: Also, the difference between the mean and the mode is unbounded <ref> [11] </ref>. If d (n; k) is the number of partitions of n with exactly k distinct parts, the polynomial P d (n; k)y k , 0 k bnc, does not, in general, have all roots real and the sequences fd (n; k)g seem to be log-concave. <p> Also, the difference between the mean and the mode is less than one <ref> [11] </ref>. However for these sequences derived from partitions, combinatorial techniques seem difficult to apply. In fact, Szekeres' analytic proof [16] is the only proof that fp (n; k)g and fd (n; k)g are unimodal for n sufficiently large. No combinatorial proof of this unimodality exists.

Because of similar difficulties, we have only been able to show that our results on log-concavity hold only for n sufficiently large.
