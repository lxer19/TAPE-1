Abstract: Many questions have arisen about the identities and parentage of Przewalski's horses in the Askania Nova breeding group. Due to the importance of this group in contributing genetic variation to this endangered species, it is desired to resolve the pedigree confusions. Genetic data are available to address this question. The problem provides a framework for the development of practical algorithms for estimating genealogies, using the likelihood of parental relationship as the criterion for assigning offspring, and using Bayesian methods to update information on parental genetic characteristics in the light of the offspring assigned. Software to implement these methods has also been developed, and is described. The details of the results with regard to the Askania Nova Przewalski's horses are described, and some suggestions are made as to possible animal identities. These may prove useful both in continuing efforts to resolve these pedigree uncertainties, and also in defining the limits that such resolution is possible.

Reference-contexts: This seems justified given the evidence from genetic typing in both domestic and Przewalski's horses. <ref> (Bowling and Ryder, 1987) </ref>. It is not clear how linkage between loci would affect results, but the effect is unlikely to be major unless the loci were tightly linked.

Reference-contexts: assignment to update information on unobserved parents and children we were able to build a pedigree that gave some insight into both the relationships and the genotypes of unobserved animals. 2.2 Joint probabilities and Peeling Peeling allows the computation of an exact probability of data observed on an assumed pedigree <ref> (Cannings et al 1978) </ref>. It becomes infeasible for pedigrees like the Askania Nova pedigrees due to the loops and presence of many unobserved individuals. Our method does not compute an exact likelihood and does not maximize the likelihood across the entire pedigree.

Reference-contexts: The old Askania line became extinct at Askania Nova in the 1950s, although descendants of the original Askania founders (#1, #5, and #52) exist elsewhere <ref> (Geyer et al. 1989) </ref>. The New Askania line starts with the founder #231, her mate #146 (a Munich line stallion), and the two Old Prague line mares #283 and #396.

Reference-contexts: The species has been managed in captivity for 90 years, with only one additional wild-born founder entering the pedigree in 1948. There have been no confirmed sightings of wild Przewalski's horses since 1966 <ref> (Ryder and Wedemeyer, 1982) </ref>. The captive population now numbers almost 1000, worldwide, and descends entirely from 13 individuals, including the more recent founder. The studbook of the entire species has been maintained (Volf, 1961 et seq.).

Reference-contexts: Our method does not compute an exact likelihood and does not maximize the likelihood across the entire pedigree. It is subject to the errors associated with local optimization procedures. We used the peeling program in pedpack <ref> (Thomas, 1987) </ref> to verify that the current method did not produce extremely erroneous results due to ignoring the dependencies in the pedigree beyond parent offspring and joint distributions of parents.
