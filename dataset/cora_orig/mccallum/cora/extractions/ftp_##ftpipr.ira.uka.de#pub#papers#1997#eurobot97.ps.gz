Reference-contexts: SPIKE is moved by electric motors with spindle drive, instead of hydraulic cylinders like the original. The accuracy of SPIKE is within 10 m. SPIKE has a maximum stroke length of 150 mm and is controlled by a micro processor. <ref> [Egn94] </ref> developed a new form of the basic kinematics for the platform. <p> The direct kinematics are presented in <ref> [Egn94] </ref> and should not lead to further discussions in this paper.

Reference-contexts: MORTIMER is based on a two wheel kinematic which is explained in detail in [JLC92]. The weight of the robot lies on four passive wheels. The two motor driven wheels provide a certain number of impulses N R and N L during a time interval I. In accordance with <ref> [JB96] </ref>: c m = D n =nC e (1) where D n is the diameter of the wheel, n is the transmission ratio of the gear system between motor and wheel and C e is the number of impulses per turn. c m is the measurement for the distance per impulse. <p> With all these information the acceleration vector can be calculated and given to the Stewart platform. 2.2 VIPER VIPER disposes of a new, omnidirectional driving concept which was firstly developed by "Maschinen-baubetrieb Gronau". This driving concept is based on a combination of a differential and a synchro drive <ref> [JB96] </ref>, while the calculations of the kinematics are presented in [Sch96]. VIPER has a rectangular shape with a size of 650mm by 900mm. Additionally, a round shape is added to the robot's front.

Reference-contexts: VIPER has a maximum velocity of v max = 0:7 m s and a maximum acceleration of a max = 0:4 m s . Therefore, both vehicles have approximately the same ac celation characteristics but in different directions. ferential 3 The Stewart-Platform In figure 4 the Stewart-Platform <ref> [Ste65] </ref> SPIKE 3 is shown. It was built up as a model of a hydraulic simulation platform in scale 1:4 compared to the original [Wil97]. SPIKE is moved by electric motors with spindle drive, instead of hydraulic cylinders like the original. The accuracy of SPIKE is within 10 m.
