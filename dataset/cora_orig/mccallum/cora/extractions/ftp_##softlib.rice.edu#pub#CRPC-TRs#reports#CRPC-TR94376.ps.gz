Abstract: We consider an extended mixed finite element formulation for groundwater flow and transport problems with either a tensor hydraulic conductivity or a tensor dispersion. While the aquifer domain can be geometrically general, in our formulation the computational domain is rectangular. The approximating spaces for the mixed method are defined on a smooth curvilinear grid, obtained by a global mapping of the rectangular, computational grid. The original problem is mapped to the computational domain, giving a similar problem with a modified tensor coefficient. Special quadrature rules are introduced to transform the mixed method into a simple cell-centered finite difference method with a 9 point stencil in 2-D and 19 point stencil in 3-D. The resulting scheme is locally mass conservative. In the case of flow, linear Galerkin procedures give first order accurate velocities, while our method is second order accurate. Both computational and theoretical results are given.

TRANSPORT BY THE CHARACTERISTICS-MIXED METHOD The characteristics-mixed method of Arbogast and Wheeler <ref> [1] </ref>, [2] is a method for approximating the transport problem (1.2)-(1.3).

The characteristics-mixed method <ref> [1] </ref>, [2] is used for transport. The code is designed to run on a massively parallel, distributed memory computer. We present first a 2-D example on a circular domain with a single well at the center injecting a tracer solute.

Reference-contexts: Our numerical scheme is based on mixed finite element methods, because they conserve mass locally and give a good approximation of the flux variable. However, mixed methods can be difficult to implement directly. By using special quadrature rules for evaluating the integrals, Russell and Wheeler <ref> [6] </ref> showed that the standard cell-centered finite difference method was equivalent to the lowest order, RT 0 mixed method [5]. Thus, the RT 0 mixed method can be easily implemented as a five or seven point finite difference method.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the RT 0 mixed method can be easily implemented as a five or seven point finite difference method. Weiser and Wheeler <ref> [8] </ref> obtained superconvergence results for this scheme; that is, if h is the maximum grid spacing, both the pressure and velocity are approximated to order h 2 . A Galerkin method will approximate the velocity only to order h.
