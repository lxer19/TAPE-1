Abstract: This paper describes a reservation protocol to provide real-time services to mobile users in an Integrated Services Packet Network. Mobility of hosts has significant impact on the quality of service provided to a real-time application. The currently proposed network system architecture and mechanisms to provide real-time services to fixed hosts are inadequate to accommodate the mobile hosts which can frequently change their point of attachments to the fixed network. Mobile hosts may experience wide variations of quality of service due to mobility. To obtain mobility independent service guarantees, a mobile host needs to make advance resource reservations at multiple locations it may possibly visit during the lifetime of the connection. The currently proposed reservation protocol in the Internet, RSVP, is not adequate to make such reservations for mobile hosts. In this paper, we describe a new reservation protocol, MRSVP, for supporting Integrated Services in a network with mobile hosts.

Reference-contexts: A fixed sender uses the destination address DST of the flow F as the destination IP address in all Path messages. However, if DST is a unicast destination address, the receiver anchor node of a mobile receiver will deliver the Path messages using RSVP tunnelling mechanism <ref> [17] </ref> to the receiver and each of its remote proxy agents when necessary. For a mobile sender, its sender anchor node acts as a fixed sender for the flow F 2 . <p> Augmenting Integrated Services modules at the routers : The functionality of active and passive reservations can be implemented as part of the integrated services module. The 21 information of active and passive reservations are carried by the RSVP messages, but they are opaque to RSVP. 3. RSVP tunnel <ref> [17] </ref>: When a mobile host is not in its home subnet, Mobile-IP uses tunnels to deliver packets to the mobile host. In MRSVP, messages are tunnelled using RSVP tunnels which allow resource reservation at the routers within the tunnel. We have presented two designs of MRSVP.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the mobile users may have to adapt to these changes as they move with their flows active. In some extreme cases, some connections to the mobile users may have to be dropped if the minimum QoS requirements of all users cannot be satisfied <ref> [22, 18] </ref>.

In such a case, resource reservations for a mobile host must be established along the route determined by Mobile-IP.

Reference-contexts: These protocols cannot be used by a mobile host to acquire a care-of address remotely in a foreign subnet where it is not currently present. Hence, a mobile host needs to use a mechanism such as Service Location Protocol <ref> [29] </ref> to acquire care-of addresses remotely. The details of this mechanism is out of the scope of this paper. In the following, we describe an alternative protocol for dynamically acquiring foreign agent care-of-address in a foreign subnet where the mobile host is not currently located.

Reference-contexts: The set of senders to whom a particular reservation request should be forwarded for different reservation styles is described by the FILTER SPEC and SCOPE objects in a Resv message. The formats and contents of TSPEC, RSPEC and SENDER TSPEC are determined by the integrated services modules <ref> [30] </ref> and are generally opaque to RSVP. The Resv message traverses the reverse path of data flow from the sender to the receiver and is forwarded hop by hop. If at any router along this path, the reservation is rejected, the router sends a ResvErr message to the receiver. <p> Thus the reservation state contains a pair (Re, Te) where Re contains the effective RSPEC for active and passive reservations and Te contains the effective TSPEC of the active and passive reservation. The rule for merging FLOWSPECs are defined by the Integrated Services specification <ref> [30] </ref>. The steps in computing these effective values are: 1. Compute the effective FLOWSPEC of the active reservation by merging the FLOWSPECs of active reservation from different next hops. Similarly compute the effective FLOWSPEC of the passive reservation by merging the FLOWSPECs of passive reservation obtained from different next hops.
