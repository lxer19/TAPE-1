Abstract: Opinion is still divided over the role that internal world models can play in autonomous behaviour. Researchers who dispute the necessity of such models often have a restricted view of how they are constituted and may associate the whole enterprise of modelling with the dubious practices of GOFAI. However, this paper pursues Roitblat's approach [1] in developing a more general and less assumption-laden interpretation of what `representationalism' means. It presents a no-strings theory of representation which shows why we should expect autonomous agents to use internal models and what these models will look like.

Reference-contexts: If experience at one time is to affect behaviour at another, then the organism must have some means of representing that experience. Some change in the organism must depend on the experience, which can influence later behaviour. Such changes are representations. <ref> [1] </ref> The present theory adds a new twist to this.

Reference-contexts: Some follow Brooks' hard-line position arguing that explicit representations and models of the world are unnecessary and `get in the way' [2,3]. Others feel that such models have a role to play but fear that their use inevitably leads back to GOFAI computationalism <ref> [4] </ref>. This paper presents a different approach to the debate. It provides a `no-strings' theory of representation based on a simple efficiency argument. It shows why we should expect that autonomous agents will use internal representations 1 and it shows what these representations will probably look like.

Reference-contexts: Nor does it refer to GAs, embodiment, stochastic resonance or any other currently popular (or unpopular) approach. It is thus paradigm-neutral. 2 Neo-representationalism The theory, which I call neo-representationalism, is based on an efficiency argument involving the concept of behavioural triggers. (A related argument is presented in <ref> [5] </ref>.) Imagine that we have an agent with a range of behaviours, one of which is called B. Let us call the set of internal phenomena which initiate this be-haviour B's internal trigger.

Reference-contexts: and that the external trigger for fleeing is `ambush', the 2 Some authors insist that a symbol which is used by an agent for representational purposes cannot be a part of the agent, i.e., that the agent cannot use a part of itself as if it were an external object <ref> [6] </ref>. However, this view seems rather suspect. Humans, for example, regularly treat parts of themselves as pseudo-external objects, e.g., when they `use' their hands to carefully position their feet, or to comb their hair. 3 external trigger for freezing is `tank' while the external trigger for attacking is `infantry'.
