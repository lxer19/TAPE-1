Abstract: We built a system that allows musical performers (and listeners) who wish to play together to organize into multiple session groups. The users interact in real time over the network, and may dynamically join or leave a session group. The players contribute to the session by playing on their MIDI controllers, using General MIDI protocol. We assume a totally asynchronous environment in which failures of both end systems and communication links are possible. TransMIDI was implemented using the Transis group communication system for fault tolerance and coordination. Transis is a transport layer that supports efficient and reliable multicast and membership services. The advanced Transis group services allow for different forms of cooperation among performers, so that many different kinds of musical ensembles can be easily established. Moreover, TransMIDI provides its users with means for exploring novel ways of musical interaction.

Reference-contexts: One of our current efforts, is the gearing of the Transis system towards new emerging network technologies such as ATM. We intend to run our system over classical UDP/IP with LAN emulation over ATM (LANE) [ATM95]. We have also developed the congress group resolution protocol <ref> [ABDL96] </ref>, which we intend to exploit as a basis for a membership service over ATM networks. 4 TransMIDI Architecture The TransMIDI system (depicted in Figure 1) enables musical performers and listeners to organize into multiple session groups.

Reference-contexts: Our system utilizes the Transis group communication system. The Transis system supports reliable multi-cast services with various ordering options, as well as the multicast group abstraction. These services have been proven to be very useful for networking multimedia applications <ref> [CHKD96, ACDK97] </ref>. The large amount of data associated with audio and video files, raises considerable problems for developing real-time multimedia applications over the network. One solution is the improvement of the hardware performance and software efficiency. Another solution is to devise new compact media representations and compression schemes.

Reference-contexts: Despite all this, MIDI does have its limitations, particularly concerning the definition of new tuning systems and the dynamic control of continuous data. Additionally, it cannot dynamically control audio parameters.
