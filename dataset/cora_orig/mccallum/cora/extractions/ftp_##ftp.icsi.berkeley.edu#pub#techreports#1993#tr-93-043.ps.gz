Abstract: This paper studies tail bounds on supercritical branching processes with finite distributions of offspring. Given a finite supercritical branching process fZ n g 1 0 , we derive upper bounds, decaying exponentially fast as c increases, on the right-tail probability Pr[Z n &gt; cE(Z n )]. We obtain a similar upper bound on the left-tail probability Pr[Z n &lt; E(Z n ) c ] under the assumption that each individual generates at least two offspring. As an application, we observe that the evaluation of an AND/OR tree by a canonical algorithm in certain probabilistic models can be viewed as a two

Reference-contexts: The random variable Z n is thus the number of offspring in the nth generation of this process. For convenience, we may also use Z n to refer to the set of offspring in the nth generation. For an introduction to the theory of branching processes, see [5], <ref> [2] </ref>. The branching factor of a branching process is = E (Z 1 ) = P 1 j=0 jp j , which is the expected number of offspring of a single element. <p> A positive regular multitype branching process is supercritical if &gt; 1. The following theorem characterizes the asymptotic growth of a supercritical multitype branching process (for a proof, see [5, pp. 37-38,44] or <ref> [2, pp. 185,192] </ref>). Theorem 4 Let fZ n g be a multitype branching process with k types that is positive regular and supercritical. Let &gt; 1 be its branching factor.

For a positive regular multitype branching process, we call the dominant eigenvalue of its mean matrix M the branching factor of the process.
