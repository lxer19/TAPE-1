Title: A Study of Internet Round-trip Delay  
Author: Anurag Acharya Joel Saltz 
Address: College Park 20742  
Affiliation: UMIACS and Department of Computer Science University of Maryland,  
Abstract: We present the results of a study of Internet round-trip delay. The links chosen include links to frequently accessed commercial hosts as well as well-known academic and foreign hosts. Each link was studied for a 48-hour period. We attempt to answer the following questions: (1) how rapidly and in what manner does the delay change in this study, we focus on medium-grain (seconds/minutes) and coarse-grain time-scales (tens of minutes/hours); (2) what does the frequency distribution of delay look like and how rapidly does it change; (3) what is a good metric to characterize the delay for the purpose of adaptation. Our conclusions are: (a) there is large temporal and spatial variation in round-trip time (RTT); (b) RTT distribution is usually unimodal and asymmetric and has a long tail on the right hand side; (c) RTT observations in most time periods are tightly clustered around the mode; (d) the mode is a good characteristic value for RTT distributions; (e) RTT distributions change slowly; (f) persistent changes in RTT occur slowly, sharp changes are undone very shortly; (g) jitter in RTT observations is small and (h) inherent RTT occurs frequently.

Reference-contexts: Third, we wanted to measure RTT to individual hosts and not host groups. This is relevant since several busy web servers (for example, NCSA) use a single host name for a group of servers and use round-robin DNS <ref> [2] </ref> in an attempt to balance load between them (see [9] for application of this technique for the NCSA web server). Fourth, we wanted the sites to be spread out in a geographical sense. We made the selections in the following way.

Reference-contexts: The average skew measures across all links are: (a) 0.22, (b) 0.16, (c) 0.19, (d) 0.23, (e) 0.20 and (f) 0.19. slowly. This suggests that while efforts to predict future RTT based on previous observations may not have produced the desired results <ref> [8] </ref>, efforts to predict the future distribution of RTT based on the distribution of previous observations may have a greater likelihood of success. 9 Spikes in RTT observations are isolated As noted in previous sections, RTT distributions at all time-scales are skewed and possess a long tail on the right hand
