Abstract: a) Given an expression for the average probability of error for user 1 when we use the receiver that was optimal in part (a) of that question. (This is called the maximal-ratio combiner.) b) Consider a receiver which first obtains a LLSE estimate of X from the received signals at the antennas and then decides 1 if the estimate is positive and 1 otherwise. (This is called the LLSE receiver.) Derive the LLSE receiver, and give an expression for the probability of error. (doesn't have to be in closed form, only good enough for numerical computation.) p magnitude of the received power P of user 2 depending on how far it is from the antennas. Also, let the Gaussian noise power at each antenna be 2 = 10 12 . Compute numerically (using MATLAB or your favorite tool) and plot the probabilities of errors of the two receivers for a wide range of P to get a feel of the ranges for which their performance differs and for which they are similar. d) A multi-user receiver is said to be near-far resistant if the performance does not get arbitrarily bad as the power of the the other users increases. From your numerical results above, would you say that the maximal-ratio combiner is near-far resistant? How about the LLSE receiver? Can you give any intuition to support your observations? (It would be nice but not necessary to give an analytical justification.) 3. Let X be a scalar rv with known distribution that is symmetrical about zero. Define g k = E(X k ). Let Y = X 3 . Express your answers in terms of the g k 's. a) What is the MMSE of X given Y ? b) What is the LLSE of X given Y ? c) Suppose we are given two more observations Z 1 = X + W and Z 2 = X 2W , where W ~ N(0; 1) and independent of X and Y . What is the LLSE of X given Y; Z 1 ; Z 2 ? d) Suppose now that V = X 2 . What is the MMSE of X given V? c) Suppose there are 3 antennas, (h 1 ; h 2 ; h 3 ) = 10 5 (1; 2; 3) and g 1 = g 2 = g 3 =
