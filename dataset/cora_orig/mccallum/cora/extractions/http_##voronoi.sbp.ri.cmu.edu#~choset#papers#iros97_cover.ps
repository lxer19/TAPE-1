Title: Coverage Path Planning: The Boustrophedon Cellular Decomposition  
Author: Howie Choset Philippe Pignon 
Abstract: Coverage path planning is the determination of a path that a robot must take in order to pass over each point in an environment. Applications include vacuuming, floor scrubbing, and inspection. The boustrophedon cellular decomposition is a new type of exact cellular decomposition approach that was developed to provide a solution to the floor coverage algorithm. Each cell in the boustrophedon is covered with a back and forth motion. Once each cell is covered, then the entire environment is covered. Experiments on a mobile robot validate this approach.

Bountrophedon Path. 2 Prior Work Previous works in floor coverage include applications such as vacuum cleaning <ref> [2] </ref> and floor cleaning. In these approaches, the robot must explicitly be programmed and the algorithms rely on landmarks deployed in the environment. Modern agricultural operations represent a significant opportunity for coverage applications.

Reference-contexts: This can be viewed as part of the cost in the tradeoff in guaranteeing the robot covers the entire environment. Although the approach in this paper appears to be new, a similar approach with cooperating robots was mentioned in [4]. Another related floor coverage approach is described in <ref> [3] </ref>. In this work, a set of templates are used to cover only a monotone region. This Fig. 4. Trapezoidal Decomposition Fig. 5.

Reference-contexts: If each cell can be covered by the robot, then the floor coverage problem reduces to the traveling salesman problem, for which a solution (which may be sub-optimal) always exists. A useful cellular decomposition technique is the trapezoidal decomposition <ref> [5] </ref> (also known as the slab method [8]) in which the robot's free space is decomposed into trapezoidal regions. This approach assumes that a vertical line, termed a slice, sweeps left to right through a bounded environment which is populated with polygonal obstacles.

Reference-contexts: In these approaches, the robot must explicitly be programmed and the algorithms rely on landmarks deployed in the environment. Modern agricultural operations represent a significant opportunity for coverage applications. The Demeter project <ref> [7] </ref> is used to harvest large fields; in this approach the robot uses vision to guide it path along side the previous cut crop line. The approach to floor coverage used in this paper is an adaptation an already existing provably complete motion planning scheme, termed cellular decomposition. <p> The implementation worked, but had some Fig. 12. Two cells have been covered. Fig. 13. Coverage almost complete. Fig. 14. Complete coverage. problems with dead reckoning. In particular, not all lines were perfectly parallel. This approach can benefit from the vision based techniques used in the Demeter project <ref> [7] </ref>. 7 Conclusion and Future Work This paper describes a new type of floor coverage algorithm that is complete. That is, the robot, in theory, is guaranteed to follow a path such that every point in the environment is passed over by the robot.

A monotone polygon with respect to a line l is one whose boundary intersects all lines parallel to l once or twice <ref> [8] </ref>. Starting form the left, boustrophedon motion is easily planned in a monotone polygon by moving inside the polygon up and down parallel to the line l and at the end of each lengthwise motion, taking a step to the right.

Reference-contexts: This approach also considers "real world" issues such as the non-holonomic constraints of the robot's wheels. The floor coverage algorithm described in <ref> [9] </ref> is well suited to unstructured environments.
