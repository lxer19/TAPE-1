Reference-contexts: However, even the value of 2 is not known. See [4, 5] for some recent progress on this problem. In another direction Abbasi and Sengupta <ref> [1] </ref> consider the following algorithmic question: Given x find a y which minimizes S (x; y). They show that one can find such a y in time O (n log n). <p> k = n 2 : Here we use the fact that if k = 2 log C n + a and a 1 then = C a 1 2 . 4 Conclusion and Open Problems Our initial study of E [S (x; y)] was motivated the algorithmic question considered in <ref> [1] </ref>: Given x find a y which minimized S (x; y). The first approach was to solve the problem approximately. If we pick y at random we hope that S (x; y) would not be too large.

Reference-contexts: is negative the event in consideration is equivalent to x [i; k] = y [i; k] and again the probability of this event is C k+i . - 7 - 3 The Concentration Result The second moment method is widely use to prove concentration results for various problems in combinatorics <ref> [2] </ref>. Here we use the same method to obtain our concentration result.

Reference-contexts: We let S (x; y) denote the largest k such that x and y have a k-matching. The purpose of this note is to study S (x; y) when x and y are randomly chosen with uniform distribution over n . Chvatal and Sankoff <ref> [3] </ref> in a seminal paper consider the function L (x; y) the length of the longest common substring in x; y.

Reference-contexts: In molecular biology parlance a common substring of length k in x and y is called a k-homology between x and y. Homology is an important measure of similarity between two DNA <ref> [7] </ref>. We let S (x; y) denote the largest k such that x and y have a k-matching. The purpose of this note is to study S (x; y) when x and y are randomly chosen with uniform distribution over n .

Reference-contexts: We only refer to consecutive substrings of a string, hence we drop "consecutive" as no confusion arises. It is known that S (x; y) is around 2 log C n almost always; more precisely the following result can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. Theorem 1.1 Let be an alphabet with C letters.
