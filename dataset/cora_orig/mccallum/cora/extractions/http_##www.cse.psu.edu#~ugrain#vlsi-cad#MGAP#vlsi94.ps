Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION The discrete cosine transform (DCT) plays an important role in speech and image processing. In particular two-dimensional DCT s have been an industry standard in image data compression because its performance is nearly optimal. Since its first introduction <ref> [1] </ref> a number of fast computation algorithms and techniques have been introduced. They can be divided into three categories. The first is based on the direct factorization of the DCT matrix [4][7], which results in an irregular architecture and complicated routing. <p> The one-dimensional DCT for a data sequence -x (n), 0 n N-1- is defined as (Eq. 2) The above equation is slightly dif ferent from the original DCT def inition <ref> [1] </ref>. However, since the dif ference is the only constant factor , it is suf ficient to consider the above equation as the DCT for the simplicity. The one-dimensional DHT for a data sequence -y (n), 0 n N-1- is defined as [2] where .

Reference-contexts: The second is based on a rotation of the output of Discrete Fourier T ransform (DFT) or Discrete Hartley Transform (DHT) [3][8][9]. The last category of DCT algorithms is based on the direct multiplication of the DCT matrix and signal vector <ref> [12] </ref> by using distributed arithmetic which requires lar ge local memories for lookup tables. Most of these algorithms were implemented using specialized VLSI chips. In this paper we present an ef ficient, systolic 2-D DCT algorithm on a 2-D mesh of fine-grained processors. <p> Fig. 7 Block Diagram of the MGAP Board p p 4.2 Mapping 2-D DCTs onto the MGAP To implement the DCT on the MGAP, first we have to decide the number of digits per word. Based on previous experiments <ref> [12] </ref>, we chose 18 bits per word and the 18 bit word processor consists of a 3x3 subarray of base 4 digit processors; i.e., p=9. Besides the advantage of fast arithmetic, a number of 2-D DCTs can be processed in unison on the MGAP.
