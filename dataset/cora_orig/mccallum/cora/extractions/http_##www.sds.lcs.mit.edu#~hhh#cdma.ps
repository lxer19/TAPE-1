Title: Wavelength Division vs. Code Division Access Methods for Optical Networks  
Author: Henry Houh 
Date: May 13, 1993  
Abstract: This paper examines two methods of multiple access for optical networks: code-division and wavelength division. Two approaches are given for analyzing code-division systems, and an overview of a proposal for a WDM network will be summarized. Since the maturity of the technologies necessary for such systems differ, the usefulness of a direct comparison between CDMA and WDM is limited; instead, this paper seeks to identify the important elements of each of these access methods, and to evaluate CDMA and WDM in terms of those elements. Both these access methods will be analyzed in terms of their practicality in an optical network.

Reference-contexts: In a CDMA network access method proposed by Azizoglu et al <ref> [1] </ref>, Optical Orthogonal Codes (OOC) are used to access the network and to provide a minimum amount of inter symbol interference. If each transmitter uses a distinct code, then interference between users can be kept to a minimum. <p> An OOC code set is one in which a = c = 1. Azizoglu <ref> [1] </ref> first analyzes the theoretical bound on error rate for OOC codes [5], then introduces a variant to OOCs ( a = c = 2) which allows many more users access. The theoretical bound for error rates using this code set is also determined. <p> In <ref> [1] </ref>, it is stated that a = 2 code can allow 41,500 users with an F of 1000.

Reference-contexts: If each transmitter uses a distinct code, then interference between users can be kept to a minimum. Azizoglu proposes an alternate code set based on OOCs, and calculates the theoretical limit on the error rates of systems employing these code sets. Brady et al <ref> [2] </ref> proposes a prime code CDMA access method, but more importantly, derives bounds on the probability of error for the system from a semiclassi 2 cal standpoint, incorporating the quantum nature of light with a statistical interpretation of the photon detection process. 2.2 Architectural issues of optical net works A single <p> From [5] the constraint on the maximum number of users for a = 2 code is: M K (K 1)(K 2) Table 1 shows the size of various code sets for codes with similar parameters. 4.3.2 Optical detection using a photomulti plier model.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, two methods are examined for using multiple access methods for building a high-speed optical network. 1.1 Access methods to be examined The first access method to be examined is Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM). This is the approach used by a wideband optical consortium led by Bell-core <ref> [3] </ref>, as well as other such consortia. A summary of the Bellcore optical network proposal will be given. The second method to be examined is Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) methods. These are systems which allow sharing based on special encoding for each user or communications channel. <p> The latest enabling development is the erbium-doped fiber amplifier, which can amplify optical signals over a range of wavelengths. This enables all-optical amplification systems rather than electrical detection and regeneration. 2.1 Proposed access methods The WDM Optical Network proposed by Brackett et al <ref> [3] </ref> utilizes separate wavelengths to access the network, and special wavelength switchers to route signals between portions of the network. <p> A WDM system in a broadcast star network is similar to the CB radio. One common wavelength channel can be used negotiate for direct connections on other wavelengths. 3.1 Architecture of Bellcore proposal The Optical Network Consortium led by Bellcore <ref> [3] </ref> approaches high capacity optical networks by the use of WDM technology, as shown in Figure 2. While it is possible to fit hundreds or even thousands of distinct channels into a fiber, Brackett et al propose just to use eight wavelengths throughout the entire network.

Reference-contexts: While using one very large wavelength router is probably not the correct solution to this problem, it is no simple matter to devise a topology that is. Consider the case of a one-wavelength n-input n-output wavelength router. This is similar to standard packet switches, and a Benes configuration <ref> [4] </ref> of AOTFs can be used. In this case, order nlog 2 (n) AOTFs are required. This is only possible because the AOTFs are tunable independently for all frequencies. Separate switching planes for all the different wavelengths can all be superimposed onto the single plane of AOTFs.

Reference-contexts: The noise gets "spread" while the original signal rises out of the noise. Other transmitting users also contribute to the background noise. Given that a code can be designed that minimizes overlaps between codes <ref> [5] </ref>, an analysis can be done of error rates for the overall system of many users. <p> An OOC code set is one in which a = c = 1. Azizoglu [1] first analyzes the theoretical bound on error rate for OOC codes <ref> [5] </ref>, then introduces a variant to OOCs ( a = c = 2) which allows many more users access. The theoretical bound for error rates using this code set is also determined. In an OOC, it is given that cross correlations between all codes can be only over one chip. <p> Instead, the code set considered is one which has higher limits on the cross- and off-peak auto-correlation values. By increasing these parameters in the design of the codes, the code space grows dramatically for the same weight using the same number of chips. From <ref> [5] </ref> the constraint on the maximum number of users for a = 2 code is: M K (K 1)(K 2) Table 1 shows the size of various code sets for codes with similar parameters. 4.3.2 Optical detection using a photomulti plier model.

Reference-contexts: No physical fiber need have more than m connections; nodes which cannot obtain a direct routed connection to another node can use an intermediate node to relay the data. 3 Filter Brackett proposes "Shu*eNet" <ref> [8] </ref> as an example of how this can be accomplished.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [9] </ref>, one such code set, an "Optical Orthogonal Code (OOC)," is defined. By knowing the method in which the signal was orignally coded, the orignal signal can be easily recovered.

Reference-contexts: This is necessary because current bulk AOTFs consume too much acoustical power to switch more than one frequency simultaneously. Laboratory prototypes of the separate elements of the AOTF exist and have been demonstrated to perform their functions <ref> [11] </ref>. All the elements, however, have not yet been integrated onto one substrate. This is one of the principal research goals of the Bellcore consortia. Using existing integrated laser array technology [13], an array with four integrated lasers with equally spaced at 4 nm wavelengths will be used.

Reference-contexts: Without the ability to rapidly change codes, though, the connections between users in a network essentially remain static. 4.4.3 Other coding options One potential option for code access in the literature appears to be the use of a phase grating to do both the encoding and decoding. In <ref> [12] </ref>, a high-bandwidth optical pulse is separated into spectral components for which a spatial phase filter is used to give some phase variation over these spectral components. When the components are reassembled, the pulse is spread out.
