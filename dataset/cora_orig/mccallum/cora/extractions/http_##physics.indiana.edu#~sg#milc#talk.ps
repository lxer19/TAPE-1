Title: RECENT PROGRESS ON LATTICE QCD WITH MIMD PARALLEL COMPUTERS 1 The MILC Collaboration 2  
Abstract: We describe recent progress in numerical computations of the properties of strongly interacting elementary particles. On the 512 node Intel Paragon at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, we are calculating the parameter "f B ," which is needed in order to extract weak interaction properties of the B meson. We are also studying the "deconfining" phase transtion, the thermodynamics of the quark-gluon plasma, and the low energy hadronic spectrum. Figure 1: Convergence of the "effective mass" of the lattice B meson propagator in the hopping expansion. The x axis is time, the y axis is iteration number. The y-independence at the top of the figure indicates convergence of the algorithm; the x-independence, that a pure B meson has been extracted. (24 3 fi 80 lattice, fi = 6:3)

Reference-contexts: An even more daunting I/O problem was posed by the larger size (1.27 Gbytes) of the quark propagators. The only solution was to make use of the "hopping parameter" computation of the heavy quark propagator advocated by Henty and Kenway <ref> [1] </ref>. One first computes the light quark propagator, and then uses an iterative scheme to compute the heavy quark propagator. At each order in the latter computation, "mesons" propagators are formed and stored.
