Abstract: Statistical operations are often facilitated by other operations. We can facilitate modeling operations by testing their input for irregularities and removing problems wherever possible. A planning representation is well-suited to this task. We describe the representation used in Igor, a system for exploratory data analysis, and its integration with two modeling systems, Pearl's IC and Cohen's FBD. We show that introducing outliers into the inputs of the algorithms can influence their performance. We demonstrate that a planning representation offers a flexible way of integrating outlier detection and removal into the modeling process, taking account of specific characteristics of the modeling operations involved.

Reference-contexts: In general, we apply transformations to the input of an operation to ensure that it corresponds to the requirements of the operation and to improve the quality of its results. Igor is a knowledge-based system designed for exploratory statistical analysis of complex systems and environments <ref> [1] </ref>. Igor uses a script-based planning representation to guide application of statistical operations. In Igor models of data are built incrementally and opportunistically, relying on information acquired during the exploration and modeling process. In this paper we describe a limited integration of exploration and modeling in Igor. <p> This discussion should not be taken as criticism of the modeling algorithms; these considerations lie outside their domain. It is rather recognition of the limits of their applicability. By integrating data exploration with modeling operations we extend these limits. 3 Igor Elsewhere <ref> [1] </ref> we draw an analogy between the process of EDA and planning. Briefly: * Exploratory strategies are plans consisting of sequences of statistical operations; these oper ations are actions that transform data relationships. * As in planning, primitive exploratory operations can be combined in different ways for different effects.

Reference-contexts: Retrying an operation is analogous to retrying an action as a part of plan failure recovery. Selecting a different, more promising strategy corresponds to replanning. Igor uses a script-based planning representation, based on the RESUN signal interpretation system <ref> [2] </ref>, to guide application of statistical operations. In Igor, sequences of simple operations are combined for complex effect.

(A full discussion of v ii is beyond the scope of this paper, but see <ref> [4] </ref>.) We use v ii to identify high leverage cases, those most likely to bias the predictors of a variable in a model. Rather than running the test on the entire dataset before running FBD, as we did with IC, we can take advantage of FBD's incremental construction.

Reference-contexts: While we have mechanisms in place, focusing heuristics, to decide among potentially applicable actions, we have only begun to examine the knowledge required to make the correct decisions. There are larger issues we will address in further work, in particular the notion of statistical strategies <ref> [6] </ref> in exploration. We hope to incorporate more complex interactions into the exploration and modeling process. Domain specific knowledge plays a strong role in the work of real statisticians; our work has left issues in representation so far unaddressed.

Reference-contexts: Such leverage is indicated by outliers in the standardized residuals. The normal test counts an element (x; y) as an outlier in the relationship (X; Y ) if its standardized residual falls outside [2:7; +2:7]. The fourth-spread test <ref> [7] </ref> (similar to a quantile test) counts an an element (x; y) as an outlier if its residual falls more than 3=2d F below or above the fourth spread boundaries, where d F measures the spread itself. These tests give similar results for our data.

Reference-contexts: The purpose of this work is not to describe well-known statistical techniques, but rather to show how their application can be managed in the planning representation, and how control interleaves exploration and modeling. Lansky has noted that planning meshes well with iterative modeling because both processes are essentially constructive <ref> [9] </ref>. Igor's planning representation lets us tailor the combination of transformation operations with modeling operations in a way that takes advantage of the characteristics of the operations. One issue we have not addressed is the selection of facilitation operations for particular modeling operations. Outlier detection/removal is just a single example.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we describe a limited integration of exploration and modeling in Igor. We focus on a specific exploration operation, the detection of outliers in linear relationships, and two modeling algorithms, Pearl's IC <ref> [11] </ref> and Cohen's FBD [3]. We demonstrate that a planning representation offers a promising way of integrating exploration into the modeling process. <p> the range of exploration and modeling operations performed, it shows that the combination can be profitable: modeling operations can provide context for exploratory actions; exploration can test assumptions made by the modeling algorithm. 2 Motivation A central element of some well-known causal modeling algorithms is the notion of conditional independence <ref> [11] </ref>. If X, Y , and Z are disjoint sets of variables, then X and Y are said to be conditionally independent given Z, iff I (X; Z; Y ) iff P (x; yjz) = P (xjz)P (yjz). <p> Two models are said to be identical if they have the same links (edges without regard to direction) and the same uncoupled head-to-head nodes (converging arrows emanating from non-adjacent nodes, such as a ! c b.) A much more complete description is given in <ref> [11] </ref>. In our evaluation we evaluated the effects of perturbation on a model M by means of * links in M and the nominal model, * uncoupled head-to-head nodes in M and the nominal model, and * edges denoted genuine in M and the nominal model.
