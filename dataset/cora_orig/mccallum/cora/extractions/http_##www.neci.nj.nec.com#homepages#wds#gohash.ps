Abstract: We describe a simple integer-valued "hash" function h(x), where x is a binary word of some fixed length. This hash function has the prop erties that These properties of our hash functions emerge from simple number theoretic arguments. Modifications of the same idea work for ternary words and binary words of constant weight. We mention two applications of this hash function in computer programming: to playing the Oriental game of Go, and to a new heuristic method of finding good local optima for intractible combinatorial optimization problems. As an application of these properties in mathematics, we obtain new error correcting codes to radix B, with minimal distance 3. We find a lower bound on the number of codewords which implies, subject to a certain number-theoretic conjecture, that these codes include an infinite number of new record-cardinality distance-3 codes. Regardless of the fate of that conjecture, our construction certainly leads to thousands of particular new record ternary codes.

Reference-contexts: This bound (EQ 4) is in fact tight if 2 r n 4, as was shown by Best and Brouwer <ref> [1] </ref>. For the values of n (powers of 2) for which the present bound (EQ 2) equals the bound (EQ 4), in fact (EQ 4) can be improved by use of the "uju + v" construction [?], so our result does not yield any records at all.

Similarly one gets 7-local collisionlessness in the constant weight binary case with if g is a generator and the numbers g i mod p, i = 0 : : : n1, form an "S 3 -set."

Reference-contexts: This problem is known to be NP-complete <ref> [4] </ref>. One will observe that in this example, the legal words are not all n-bit words, but in fact are the n-bit words of constant weight m, which is a situation which often arises and which we will later address.

Reference-contexts: O (1) words of storage will typically need to be allocated to "remember" each new word we visit, if efficent hashing schemes (a subject which will not be addressed in this paper) are used. This algorithm is related to another idea called "TABU search" <ref> [5] </ref>. The TABU algorithm maintains a "TABU list" of the most recent T transitions one has made. T is some small number such as 9.

Reference-contexts: The hash functions we discuss are not new, but their local collisionlessness properties have not been observed in the hash function literature. Some ideas similar to this property have been used before in the combinatorics literature [8] <ref> [6] </ref>. Specifically, we recommend the following linear modular function: Regard the binary (or ternary) word as a number N in base B (B = 2 or 3 in the binary and ternary cases). <p> Graham and Sloane <ref> [6] </ref> had observed that the function P n1 i=0 id i mod n was a suitable hash function in this case.

Reference-contexts: This result is not new, since a bound which is always as strong, and usually stronger, namely A (n; 3) 2 nr ; (4) where r is the least integer with 2 r &gt; n, arises from considering the shortened binary Hamming codes <ref> [7] </ref>. This bound (EQ 4) is in fact tight if 2 r n 4, as was shown by Best and Brouwer [1]. <p> Finally, we should mention the competing Gilbert bound <ref> [7] </ref> A B (n; 3) B n ; (8) where is the least integer such that B (B 1)(n 1) + 1; (9) which is of course weaker than the bound from shortened Hamming codes, but has the advantage that it works for all B 2, prime power or not.
