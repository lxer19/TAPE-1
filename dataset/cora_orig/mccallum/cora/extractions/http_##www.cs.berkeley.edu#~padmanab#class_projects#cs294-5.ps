Title: Flow Control in ATM Networks  
Author: Venkata Padmanabhan Alok Mittal 
Date: December 9, 1994  
Abstract: Broadband packet switching networks, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks, are one of the most promising means to cater to different communication needs of a variety of users in a unified manner. While services requiring a Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees, such as video, would reserve resources, the more traditional applications, called Available Bit Rate (ABR) services, would depend on flow control for good performance. The high bandwidth offered by ATM networks as well as the notion of virtual circuits motivates design of new flow control strategies. Credit-based flow control and rate-based flow control are the two schemes receiving considerable attention in recent months. We use simulations to study the behavior of the two schemes under different situations in order to arrive at a comparative measurement. Then, we analyze the relative merits and weaknesses of each scheme and finally we discuss which of the schemes would be more suitable for ATM networks.

Reference-contexts: We initially planned to use the tcplib library <ref> [1] </ref> to generate source traffic. This library provides routines for modeling traffic of applications such as ftp, telnet etc. However, tcplib is limited in several ways. First, the ftp routines neither model the duration between successive data transfers nor the duration between two independent sessions.

Reference-contexts: Upon receiving a credit cell with credit value C for a VC, the sender increments its credit balance by C. For more details of the implementation using credit update protocol, refer to <ref> [5] </ref>. Note that we have simulated the fixed credit allocation algorithm. 3.2 Rate-Based Flow Control Rate-based flow control achieves flow control by dynamically adjusting the maximum rate at which the sender can send data. The initial rate is set to some predetermined value.

Reference-contexts: Every time the sender forwards a data cell, it decrements its credit balance by one. Thus there is no cell loss in this scheme. The scheme operates at a link-by-link level to decrease the feedback time. We simulate the N 23 scheme for credit-based flow control <ref> [6] </ref>. There is N 2 + N 3 cells of buffer space per VC at the receiver. Initial credit at the sender is N 2 + N 3.
