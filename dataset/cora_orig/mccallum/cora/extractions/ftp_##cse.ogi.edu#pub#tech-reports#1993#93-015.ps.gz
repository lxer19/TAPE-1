Reference-contexts: The strength of evidence required for assuming mutuality of a belief varies according to the conversants' requirements for certainty in the particular context of the conversation <ref> (Clark & Marshall, 1981) </ref>. What strength of evidence is required by a speaker with multiple hearers? What evidence of understanding do hearers provide when they are not the direct addressees of an utterance? The answer to these questions depends on the degree of involvement of the conversants in the conversation.

Reference-contexts: Acceptance Phase: B accepts utterance u by giving evidence e that she believes she understands what A means by u. She does so on the assumption that once A registers evidence e, he will also believe that B understands. <ref> (Clark & Schaefer, 1989, p. 261) </ref> 3 Characterization of a contribution depends on understanding both the preceding and following discourse. This is because the researcher should conclude that a presentation was accepted only after the hearer displays a sufficient amount of evidence that the contribution was understood. <p> Section 3 we extend the dyadic contribution model to account for these effects and show the extended model's representation of excerpts of multiparty discourse from the Watergate corpus. 2 Grounding When conversants collaborate to ground their conversation, they rely on evidence of understanding presented in the acceptance phase of contributions <ref> (Clark & Schaefer, 1989) </ref>. The strength of evidence required for assuming mutuality of a belief varies according to the conversants' requirements for certainty in the particular context of the conversation (Clark & Marshall, 1981).

Reference-contexts: For example in the conversation of March 22, 1973 (New York Times, 1974, 194-221), former Attorney General John Mitchell contributes only sporadically even though he is physically present throughout the interaction. In a previous study of multiparty discourse, we simulated agentsincluding overhearersin the domain of air traffic control <ref> (Novick & Ward, 1993) </ref>. We found it necessary to include such overhearer agents in our conversational models in order to account for pilots' responses to dia 4 logue that wasn't explicitly directed toward them.
