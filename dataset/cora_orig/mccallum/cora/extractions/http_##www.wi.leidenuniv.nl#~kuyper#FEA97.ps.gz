Reference-contexts: Secondly the amount of newly added data is growing rapidly, and processing this data also requires ever more advanced methods. The field of research concerned with this issue is called Information Filtering. There are two different ways in which Information Filtering can be employed <ref> [1] </ref>. One is to process new data for storage in an Information Retrieval system, the other is to provide all users with a personal information delivery system specially tailored to their personal information needs.

Reference-contexts: Note that the distance depends on the weight vector. This learning of cluster centers is similar to the learning of centers in Kohonen networks [5] in case of a fixed number of vectors, and is similar to learning in ART networks <ref> [2] </ref> for a variable number of vectors. 4 Results of Experiments The success of the AIF system depends on two assumptions. First, that the articles retrieved from a specific newsgroup should show greater similarity to each other than to articles from the other newsgroups.

Reference-contexts: We propose an AIF system for this task based on the novel combination of weighted trigram analysis, incremental clustering, and evolutionary computation. A trigram is a combination of three symbols. Trigram analysis <ref> [3] </ref> consists of determining the frequency distribution of all trigrams in a textual document. An enhancement to trigram analysis is the assignment of weights to all the trigrams indicating their relative importance for discriminating between documents on different topics.

Smeulders and R.Jain, editors, </editor> <title> Image Databases and Multi-media search: </title> <booktitle> Proceedings first International Workshop, </booktitle> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: In the future we might extend this with more prototype vectors per cluster. It is interesting to see that trigram analysis is not restricted to text: also images and digital audio can be considered. For example, in image analysis trigrams of values of neighboring pixels can be used <ref> [4] </ref>. Hence, a major advantage of our method is that it generalizes to multi-media documents. We plan also to investigate this further.

Reference-contexts: An incremental clustering algorithm is applied to weighted trigram representations of the documents creating a classification of the documents. An incremental clustering algorithm is required because AIF is a dynamic process. In incremental clustering the number of clusters is not determined in advance, and can change over time <ref> [6] </ref>. Also the prototype vectors corresponding to the clusters can move over time. To find the right weights for the trigram analysis, we designed an evolutionary algorithm.
