Abstract: In time-frequency analysis, we extend functions of one variable to functions of two variables. The functions of two variables provide information about the signal that is not easily discernible from the functions of one variable. In this paper, we investigate a method for creating quartic functions of three variables and also a quartic function of all four variables. These quartic functions provide a meaningful representation of the signal that goes beyond the well known quadratic functions. The quartic functions are applied to the design of signal-adaptive kernels for Cohen's class and shown to provide improvements over previous methods.
