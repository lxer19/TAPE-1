Title: Cabata A hybrid CBR system  
Author: Mario Lenz 
Date: January 13, 1995  
Address: Berlin  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Humboldt-University  
Abstract: This paper presents Cabata, a hybrid case-based reasoning system that has been developed at the Department of Computer Science, Humboldt-University, Berlin. The most characteristic feature of the system is the combination of model-based and case-based reasoning within a hybrid architecture.

Reference-contexts: However, for all algorithms a concept description is required. Thus these algorithms are hardly applicable for weak-theory domains. Barletta and Mark <ref> [8] </ref> suggest Explanation Based Indexing as a method to use domain-specific knowledge for an efficient memory management. This could be of use in future work on Cabata. However, it has to be extended to be more flexible and context-sensitive.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, it might be desirable to extract weaker regularities | heuristics |, too. This is somewhat difficult when using the generalization based methods. The idea is, not to learn production rules or decision trees, but to derive determination rules as described in <ref> [9] </ref>: How certain attribute values influence other attributes of the case or, possibly, the diagnosis. An example of such a determination rule has already been shown in section 3: If somebody wants to go on a bathing holiday he'll have to go to the sea.
