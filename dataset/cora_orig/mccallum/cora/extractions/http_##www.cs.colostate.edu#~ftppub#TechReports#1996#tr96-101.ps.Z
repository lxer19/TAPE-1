Reference-contexts: Some of these faults may not affect the logical behavior, but may affect the parametric or dynamic behavior. Chips with such defects may pass the functional tests but malfunction over time, causing reliability hazards <ref> [3] </ref>. Many of these faults cause elevated quiescent power fl This work was supported partly by a BMDO funded project monitored by ONR. 2 supply current (I DDQ ). <p> An analysis of the effectiveness of I DDQ testing has shown that I DDQ testing is necessary to detect a significant fraction of the defects of a SRAM <ref> [3] </ref>. In SRAMs, most of the I DDQ testable faults are activated during the write/read cycles [3],[4],[5],[6]. A write cycle forces most nodes to certain voltage levels, thus activating different faults. However, some faults may only be sensetized during the read cycle. <p> I DDQ testing can also be effective in detecting SRAMs defects that escape traditional voltage monitoring techniques. In <ref> [3] </ref>, an analysis of the effectiveness of the I DDQ testing has been done using SRAM of 8k X 8-bit words manufactured by philips, using Inductive Fault Analysis technique. The results show that a high fault coverage is achieved when I DDQ testing is performed in combination with functional testing.

Reference-contexts: In [8], a testable SRAM structure was proposed for observing the internal switching behavior of the memory cells. The proposed structure provides a very high coverage of disturb-type pattern sensitivity using a simple algorithm of complexity of 5n (n= number of memory cells). In <ref> [4] </ref>, the detailed fault model of the 6-transistor memory cell was investigated for possible transistor level faults. It was shown that intra-cell defects can cause inter-cell faults in the memory array, such as coupling faults. Such faults were shown to cause elevated I DDQ when activated.

Reference-contexts: Such faults include coupling faults and neighborhood pattern sensitive faults. In the proposed scheme, I DDQ testing is enhanced by allowing for parallel activation of words. This will allow many nodes to be activated simultaneously resulting in activation of I DDQ testable faults <ref> [5] </ref>. In this paper, we propose a testable scheme for off-line testing that enhances the I DDQ testability for CMOS SRAMs. The proposed scheme partitions the memory array into two identical partitions each with its own operational ground node. <p> In [4], the detailed fault model of the 6-transistor memory cell was investigated for possible transistor level faults. It was shown that intra-cell defects can cause inter-cell faults in the memory array, such as coupling faults. Such faults were shown to cause elevated I DDQ when activated. In <ref> [5] </ref> a testable design for memory array was shown to enhance I DDQ testing by allowing parallel access to the whole memory cells during the write cycle. The above work clearly establishes the promise of I DDQ testing for SRAMs.

Reference-contexts: The results show I DDQ testing is effective in detecting soft defects such as nMOS and pMOS floating gate faults. However, conventional voltage testing failed to detect all defective cells with a floating pMOS transistors. The idea of I DDQ testing is expanded for fault localization in <ref> [6] </ref>. In [8], a testable SRAM structure was proposed for observing the internal switching behavior of the memory cells. The proposed structure provides a very high coverage of disturb-type pattern sensitivity using a simple algorithm of complexity of 5n (n= number of memory cells).

In <ref> [7] </ref>, experimental results were reported on deploying current testing to detect defects that cause data retention problems. A current-mirrored differential sense amplifier was used to compare the current response to that of a reference current. A word addressable 16K SRAM with built-in defects was considered.

Reference-contexts: Since b t n, the testing process is speeded-up by a factor of b/n. However the accuracy of testing depends also on the performance and sensitivity of the comparator BICS used for current monitoring. It should be noted that the differential BICS reported in <ref> [9] </ref> can be used in this scheme. With this BICS circuit, for each write/read operations, testing is performed in two phases instead of one phase as suggested in this paper. 7 Conclusions This paper presented a scheme for I DDQ testable SRAM.
