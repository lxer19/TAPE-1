Also thanks to the Usenet users that have found many bugs and inaccuracies since the fi-release of X Y -pic to Usenet. Finally thanks to Donald E.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction This manual explains the features of X Y -pic that are related to diagram typesetting. It assumes that you have some experience in using T E X for typesetting mathematics, e.g., as described in "The Joy of T E X" [6], "The T E Xbook" <ref> [2] </ref>, or, in a pinch, "L A T E X| A Document Preparation System" [4]. x2 introduces the basics of diagram construction. Common diagram construction features are treated in the following two sections: x3 explains the various arrow Typeset by A M S-T E X 1 2 KRISTOFFER H. <p> Also thanks to the Usenet users that have found many bugs and inaccuracies since the fi-release of X Y -pic to Usenet. Finally thanks to Donald E. Knuth for providing the wonderful T E X typesetting system <ref> [2] </ref> and its typeface design complement METAFONT [3], and to Michael D. Spi-vak and the American Mathematical Society for their conceptually coherent and well documented format for mathematical typesetting, A M S-T E X [6]!

Reference-contexts: Extensions This section explains some ways you may extend the diagram features of X Y -pic: x5.1 You may define your own morphism types. x5.2 The spacing between entries and arrows can be changed. x5.3 The style used for entries may be changed. The technical documentation <ref> [5] </ref> explains more possibilities, e.g., how more arrow tip types may be added. 14 KRISTOFFER H. ROSE 5.1. Defining your own morphism types.

It is often desirable to have several arrows between two objects. This can be done by sliding either or both arrows sideways by giving the distance as an optional T E X dimension (cf. <ref> [6, p.150] </ref>) enclosed in &lt;&gt;s: it specifies how far `sideways' the morphism should be moved (approximately), e.g., $$"diagram A "drto&lt;1ex&gt;^a_"bot "" & B "ulto&lt;1ex&gt;^b "rto&lt;1ex&gt;^c & C "lto&lt;1ex&gt;^d_"bot "enddiagram$$ will typeset A a @ @ @ __@ @ @ c // ? oo A positive distance will slide the arrow in <p> Finally thanks to Donald E.
