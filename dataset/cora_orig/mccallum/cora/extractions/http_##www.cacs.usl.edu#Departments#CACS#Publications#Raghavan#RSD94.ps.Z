Abstract: The problem of enhancing a database management system(DBMS) to support mining applications is twofold. First DBMSs of today have limited functionality for supporting mining applications. Second scaling traditional knowledge discovery techniques for large data sets is not straight forward. Our goal is to propose a system architecture for future DBMSs that incorporate interactive modules for database mining. The novelty of our approach is to study how the concept-based retrieval, relevance feedback, and information dissemination techniques used in intelligent information retrieval systems(IIRSs) relate to each other and to apply the result of this study to the database mining problem. Specifically we emphasize the ways to reuse the knowledge obtained from previous queries.
