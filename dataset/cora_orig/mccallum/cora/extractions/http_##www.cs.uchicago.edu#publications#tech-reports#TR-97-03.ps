Abstract: The firing synchronization problem was introduced by J. Myhill in 1957. The problem concerns a one-dimensional array of finite automata. The length of the array of automata is denoted by n. All automata are identical except for the ones on the end, one of which is the initiator for the synchronization. The goal is to define the set of states and transition rules for the automata so that all machines enter a special fire state for the first time and simultaneously at some time t(n). The generalized firing synchronization problem was introduced in 1968 by F. R. Moore and G. G. Langdon [5]. This problem differs from the original firing synchronization problem in that the initiator of the synchronization can be located anywhere in the array. The generalized problem requires time 2n k 2, where n is the number of automata in the array and k is the distance from the initiator to the nearest end of the array. H. Szwerinski [6], using ideas similar to Moore and Langdon's, produced a ten-state, minimal-time, symmetric solution. We improve on that automaton to produce the first known nine-state, time-optimal, symmetric solution.

Reference-contexts: We are currently working on a correctness proof for both the 8-state and 9-state automata. Another open problem is to determine the number of states required to solve both the original and generalized firing synchronization problems. R. Balzer <ref> [1] </ref> showed that no 4-state automaton could solve the original firing synchronization problem. Mazoyer [3] gave a 6-state solution to the original 13 problem. It remains open whether 5 or 6 states are required.

Reference-contexts: Several open problems remain. The first is a formal proof of correctness that the 9-state automaton solves the firing synchronization problem. Few researchers in this area have provided correctness proofs for their automata. Indeed, J. Mazoyer's <ref> [3] </ref> proof of correctness for his 6-state solution to the original problem is the only one. Producing such proofs is vital and yet quite challenging due to the complexity of the automata involved. We are currently working on a correctness proof for both the 8-state and 9-state automata. <p> Another open problem is to determine the number of states required to solve both the original and generalized firing synchronization problems. R. Balzer [1] showed that no 4-state automaton could solve the original firing synchronization problem. Mazoyer <ref> [3] </ref> gave a 6-state solution to the original 13 problem. It remains open whether 5 or 6 states are required.

Reference-contexts: We improve on that automaton to produce the first known nine-state, time-optimal, symmetric solution. 1 1 The firing synchronization problem The firing synchronization problem was introduced by J. Myhill in 1957, and the first published reference to the subject is due to E. F. Moore in 1962 <ref> [4] </ref>. The problem concerns a one-dimensional array of finite automata. The length of the array of automata is denoted by n. All automata are identical, except the ones on either end of the array. One of the end automata is the initiator and the other is a special end machine.

We improve on that automaton to produce the first known nine-state, time-optimal, symmetric solution. 1 1 The firing synchronization problem The firing synchronization problem was introduced by J. <p> They also gave a 17-state minimal-time solution. V. I. Varshavsky, V. B. Marakkovsky and V. A. Peschansky [7] improved this result in 1970, producing a 10-state time-optimal automaton. Further work was done in 1982 by H. Szwerinski <ref> [6] </ref>. Szwerinski considered symmetric solutions. A symmetric automaton is one which has a symmetric transition function, that is, whenever a transition XY Z ! W is defined, the transition ZY X ! W must also be defined. Szwerinski gave a 10-state, minimal-time, symmetric solution to the generalized problem. <p> The simulation ends when all automata become initiators and then fire. The basic idea of this 10-state solution is summarized in this section. (See Szwerinski's paper <ref> [6] </ref> for a more detailed description of the 10-state automaton.) Consider first what happens when the initiator is located at either end. This is simply the original problem and is handled by the underlying 8-state automaton.
