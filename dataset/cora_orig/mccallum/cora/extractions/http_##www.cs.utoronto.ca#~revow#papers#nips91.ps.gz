Abstract: Hand-printed digits can be modeled as splines that are governed by about 8 control points. For each known digit, the control points have preferred "home" locations, and deformations of the digit are generated by moving the control points away from their home locations. Images of digits can be produced by placing Gaussian ink generators uniformly along the spline. Real images can be recognized by finding the digit model most likely to have generated the data. For each digit model we use an elastic matching algorithm to minimize an energy function that includes both the deformation energy of the digit model and the log probability that the model would generate the inked pixels in the image. The model with the lowest total energy wins. If a uniform noise process is included in the model of image generation, some of the inked pixels can be rejected as noise as a digit model is fitting a poorly segmented image. The digit models learn by modifying the home locations of the control points.

Reference-contexts: With a spline model it is easy to model these topological variants by small changes in the relative vertical locations of the central two control points (see figure 2). This advantage of spline models is pointed out by <ref> (Edelman, Ullman and Flash, 1990) </ref> who use a different kind of spline that they fit to character data by directly locating candidate knot points in the image. Spline models also make it easy to increase the number of Gaussian beads as their variance is decreased.

Reference-contexts: Fortunately, derivatives are simple at an energy minimum because small changes in the configuration make no change in the energy (to first order). Thus the inner loop settling leads to simple derivatives for the outer loop learning, as in the Boltzmann machine <ref> (Hinton, 1989) </ref>. 6 Results on the hand-filtered dataset We are trying out the scheme out on a relatively simple task we have a model of a two and a model of a three, and we want the two model to win on "two" images, and the three model to win on
