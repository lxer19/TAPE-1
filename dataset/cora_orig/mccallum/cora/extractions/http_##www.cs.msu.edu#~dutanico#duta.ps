Abstract: This study presents a learning approach for the face detection problem. The problem can be stated as follows: given an arbitrary black and white, still image, find the location and size of every human face it contains. Numerous applications of automatic face detection have attracted considerable interest in this problem [8, 7, 1, 5, 3, 4], but no present face detection system is completely satisfactory from the point of view of detection rate, false alarm rate and detection time. We describe an inductive learning-based detection method that produces a maximally specific hypothesis consistent with the training data. Three different sets of features were considered for defining the concept of a human face. The performance achieved is as follows: 85% detection rate, a false alarm rate of 0:04% of the number of windows analyzed and 1 minute detection time for a 320 fi 240 image on a Sun Ultrasparc 1.

The general structure of a learning-based face detection system is depicted in Figure 1. Several windows are placed at different positions and scales in the test image and a set of raw features are computed from each window and fed into a classifier. <p> The main difference among these systems is the classification method; both parametric (Markovian models - <ref> [4, 1] </ref>), non-parametric (neural networks - [7]) and a mixture of the two (Gaussian clusters in a feature space reduced by PCA - [8]) have been used. 2.

Reference-contexts: The resulting instance space of 5-bit 8 fi 6 images has 32 48 elements of which a very small fraction actually represent faces. The second and third set of features came from texture analysis. According to Gagalowicz <ref> [2] </ref>, grey-tone textures are well modeled by the histogram of the image together with a set of second-order spatial averages (c ) for jj 9 ffi of solid angle, where (see Fig. 1 (b)): c = K i=1 var (X i ) fi var (X i+ ) * i is a

Defining the human face concept In order to have a well defined concept to learn, one should first specify the instance (raw feature) space from which the concept examples are drawn. <p> To compute the correlation coefficients c , we considered 40 translations with norms up to 18 pixels (instead of norms of less than 12 pixels which correspond to 9 ffi of solid angle) in order to obtain a better discrimination power. 3. Learning algorithm Sung and Poggio <ref> [8] </ref> proposed the hypothesis according to which the face domain can be approximated by the union of a small number of ellipsoids in the instance space. <p> A hierarchical clustering of the training patterns in each feature set was performed using Ward's method. Ward's hierarchical clustering algorithm seems to be superior to the K-means algorithm (used by Sung and Poggio <ref> [8] </ref>) which produces clusters that are too dependent on the positions of the initial cluster centers.
