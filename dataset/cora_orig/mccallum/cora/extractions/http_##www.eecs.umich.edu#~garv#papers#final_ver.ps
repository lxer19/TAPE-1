Abstract: The errors present in electrical measurements at frequencies and impedances relevant to plasma processing in the semiconductor industry are studied. A theoretical bound on calculated delivered power error as a function of measured electrical values is derived. The derivation shows that for constant measurement error, power error is a linear function of load impedance expressed in terms of voltage standing wave ratio. This bound is supported by experimental data taken with both a directional coupler and a voltage- and current- based probe. Linear and nonlinear model based sensing methods are implemented which reduce power error by a factor of five over a standard calibration. Published results are cited which indicate that the voltage standing wave ratio of typical plasma processing and experimental regimes is high enough to cause small measurement errors to result in large calculated power errors.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In semiconductor manufacturing applications, RF powered plasma processes are typically driven at 13:56MHz . It has been well known since the early days of plasma processing that the power delivered to the plasma is a dominant factor affecting processing. More recent published data <ref> [14] </ref> indicates that anywhere between 10% and 90% of the input power is dissipated outside the plasma discharge. Such a finding motivates using the delivered power and not the generator power as the control input in plasma processing, as done by [5, 6]. <p> It has long been known that the plasma acts as a nonlinear load, to some degree rectifying the input frequency and resulting in a DC offset and harmonics of the fundamental frequency. Recently, Klick <ref> [14] </ref> has proposed a model for interpreting these higher harmonics as additional indicators of the plasma's physical state. It is likely that whatever challenge exists in measuring the plasma electrical state at 13:56MHz is exacerbated at higher harmonics of this frequency.
