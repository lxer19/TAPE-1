Title: Dennett and Searle on Consciousness: Relevance for Robot Construction  
Author: Mark C. Torrance for Professors Brooks and Stein

Affiliation: Embodiment and Cognition Massachusetts Institute of Technology  
Abstract: This paper contrasts Searle's theory of consciousness with Dennett's. It draws from material in Searle's book "The Rediscovery of the Mind" [ Searle, 1992 ] and his article Minds, Brains, and Programs [ Searle, 1980 ] , and Dennett's book "Consciousness Explained." [ Dennett, 1991 ] The paper focuses on issues that are relevant to the design of intelligent robot systems such as Cog. In particular, it discusses whether the question "Is this artifact conscious?" is even important to ask in the context of research on intelligent robot systems. Finding that it is, we examine Searle's arguments that suggest it is impossible to build a conscious robot, and some of Dennett's responses to these.

Reference-contexts: really "get at" consciousness by building robots. 5 Is it possible? Is it possible for people to build a conscious robot? In this section we consider Searle's arguments that it is not possible, and Dennett's responses to these. 5.1 Searle's arguments 5.1.1 The Chinese Room In Minds, Brains, and Programs <ref> [ Searle, 1980 ] </ref> , Searle presents an example of an information processing system based on what he calls strong AI , and argues that in no sense can the system really be said to understand the information it is processing, or have other appropriate mental states, despite its behavior. <p> I suppose it's a case of "I just know it when I see it." This claim that we know the consciousness of others when we see them borders on religious. In response to the "other minds reply" in <ref> [ Searle, 1980 ] </ref> , Searle offers the following: In "cognitive sciences" one presupposes the reality and knowa bility of the mental in the same way that in physical sciences one has to presuppose the reality and knowability of physical objects.
