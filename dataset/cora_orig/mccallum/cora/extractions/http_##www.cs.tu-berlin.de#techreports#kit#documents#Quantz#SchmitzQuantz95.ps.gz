Title: Speech-Event Types in Automatic Dialogue Interpreting

Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate that for an adequate translation of an utterance spoken in a dialogue its speech-event type has to be determined. We introduce an approach that automatically assigns speech-event types to utterances on the basis of both micro- and macro-structural information. Technically, this assignment is realized by modeling preference rules as weighted defaults in the Description Logic system FLEX. The speech-event type of an utterance is determined by qualitatively minimizing the exceptions to these defaults. The results described here have been developed within the VERBMO-BIL project, a project concerned with face-to-face dialogue interpreting funded by the German Ministry of Research and Technology. We present the rather positive results of a first evaluation of this implementation showing the accuracy of speech-event-type assignment.

In using some kind of illocutionary acts in a system the main problem is the automatic classification of utterances with respect to these il-locutionary acts. According to both Austin and Searle this classification is a matter of convention.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the fundamental prerequisites in the design of a Machine Translation (MT) system consists in the determination of the objective of translation, i.e. the translation target <ref> [5] </ref>. Roughly speaking, the translation target specifies those aspects of the source-language expression which are considered to be relevant and therefore are to be rendered by the target-language expression.

According to Austin we have to investigate the conventions that allow an utterance to express a certain speech-event type. These conventions are effective on two complementary levels.

Reference-contexts: Part of these feature values are provided by the syntactic component, namely those concerning keywords, the sentence type and the voice of the verb, others are semantic information. The semantics in the VERBMOBIL project is based on Discourse Representation Theory <ref> [7] </ref>. Thus semantic information is represented in discourse representation structures (DRS's). Each DRS consists of a list of conditions that express predicate-argument-structures. In the process of the semantic evaluation 11 This translation is rather literal.

Reference-contexts: These conventions are encoded in terms of pref 9 erence rules. Note that the approach described in the following is thus based on the strategy of preferential interpretation.

The basic idea is to homogeneously model preference rules, which take into account information from various sources, e.g. syntax, semantics, world knowledge. The respective degree of relevance of these rules is captured by the notion of weighted defaults.

Reference-contexts: like greeting, saying good-bye and introducing oneself, confirming the appointment and thanking the dialogue partner for the conversation, that exclusively occur in the opening or closing phases of the dialogue. 8 A detailed description of the set of speech-event types that are currently implemented in our system is given in <ref> [13] </ref>. 5 4 The Purpose of Speech-Event Types As we stated above, speech-event types represent information that is highly useful in the analysis of dialogues. This will be illustrated by several examples arising from the task of dialogue interpreting.
