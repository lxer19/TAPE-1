Reference-contexts: Denoting the homogeneous coordinates of a vector x = [x; y; ] T by ~ x, i.e., ~ x = <ref> [x; y; ; 1] </ref> T , we have s ~ m = P ~ M. <p> It can be shown that the fundamental matrix F is related to the essential matrix E = t fi R [29, 23] by 2 EA 1 It is thus clear that if the cameras are calibrated, the problem becomes the one of motion and structure from motion <ref> [29, 53, 39, 13, 1, 56, 24] </ref>. 4 Finding Candidate Matches by Correlation Before recovering the epipolar geometry, we must establish a few correspondences between images. To this end, a corner detector is first applied to each image to extract high curvature points.

Reference-contexts: They can be broadly divided into two groups: The first group consists in first extracting edges as a chain code, and then searching for points having maxima curvature <ref> [10, 2, 37] </ref> or performing a polygonal approximation on the chains and then searching for the line segment intersections [21]. The second group works directly on a grey-level image.

Reference-contexts: Haralick et al. [18] applied M-estimators to solve the pose problem from point correspondences. Thompson et al. [51] applied the LMedS estimator to detect moving objects using point correspondences between orthographic views. Other recent works on the application of robust techniques to motion segmentation include <ref> [52, 42, 3] </ref>. Regarding the robust recovery of the epipolar geometry, our work is closely related to that of Olsen [43] and that of Shapiro and Brady [49].

Reference-contexts: Over the years numerous algorithms for image matching have been proposed. They can roughly be classified into two categories: 1. Template matching. In this category, the algorithms attempt to correlate the grey levels of image patches in the views being considered, assuming that they present some similarity <ref> [4, 15, 16, 7, 14] </ref>. The underlying assumption appears to be a valid one for relatively textured areas and for image pairs with small difference; however it may be wrong at occlusion boundaries and within featureless regions. 2. Feature matching.

Reference-contexts: These methods are fast because only a small subset of the image pixels are used, but may fail if the chosen primitives cannot be reliably detected in the images. The following list of references is by no means exhaustive: <ref> [54, 50, 5, 6, 45, 35, 22, 55] </ref> The approach we propose in this paper aims at exploiting the only geometric constraint, i.e., the epipolar constraint, to establish robustly correspondences between two perspective images of a single scene.
