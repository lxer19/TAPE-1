Reference-contexts: It had significant design limitations, but later, improved packages would have to use different, less mnemonic names. Some Perl gurus therefore found it necessary to post special notices directing users away from the original "CGI" package to an improved module <ref> [Chr96] </ref>. Eventually an improved module was able to reclaim the "CGI" name, but only because Perl had changed its namespace organizing conventions, allowing old names to be reused in the new namespace organization.

Reference-contexts: On the server side, we saw how the implementation of the fetch method on the URL type was used as a server-side gateway to retrieve information from various types of Web servers. The TOM architecture also acts as a mediator to bring components together. In previous work <ref> [GAO95] </ref>, Garlan, Allen, and I showed that a common obstacle to software reuse and interoperability is architectural mismatch, where heterogeneous components fail to work together. Common causes of this mismatch, we found, were conflicting assumptions about how components should operate and communicate, and what sort of data they should share.

Reference-contexts: I first compare TOM with MIME, still the most popular convention for describing structured data on the Internet as of early 1998. While there are currently fewer TOM types than there are MIME formats (157 MIME "types" were registered as of late August 1997 <ref> [Int97] </ref>), about 20 of the more commonly used MIME formats have counterparts registered with TOM type brokers, and 105 106 CHAPTER 8.

Reference-contexts: Fully mutable objects would also restrict the flexibility of the type graph. For instance, it would be significantly more difficult to establish subtype relations, since subtypes would have to preserve not only the static properties of their supertypes, but also their history properties. (Liskov and Wing <ref> [LW94] </ref> discuss this problem in more detail.) The potential to take advantage of supertype interfaces for unfamiliar types, or to guarantee the preservation of information in conversions with intersubstitutable types, would be significantly lessened in such a system, TOM's treatment of objects as immutable values, then, makes it possible for type

Reference-contexts: Users can scroll through each of these displays as they see fit. Frames even allow diverse data sources to be displayed together without the cooperation of the original sources. For example, the "McSpotlight" Web site <ref> [McS98] </ref> uses frames to display the McDonald's web site side by side with criticism of the restaurant's on-line marketing. Netscape's frame design, however, also has several problems. First, frames are incompatible with older Web browsers that were designed for displaying only one HTML document at a time.

Reference-contexts: For example, RealAudio data is a stream designed to arrive at a client's machine in time for it to be output to a speaker as it arrives. The content of the data stream self-adjusts dynamically to accommodate the speed at which the client receives and processes data <ref> [Pro97] </ref>. Such dynamic, temporally-based data delivery is not supported by TOM, and in fact requires a special protocol to satisfy the demanding requirements of real-time audio streaming over the Internet. TOM can, however, still represent the non-real-time aspects of this information.

Reference-contexts: Common causes of this mismatch, we found, were conflicting assumptions about how components should operate and communicate, and what sort of data they should share. Shaw lists several common ad-hoc practices that programmers have developed to make components work together in the presence of such mismatches <ref> [Sha95] </ref>. The nine specific strategies, shown in Figure 8.3, cover a wide range, including publishing abstractions of components, adding converters, and maintaining parallel versions of components. TOM and its applications support all of Shaw's techniques that do not require expensive re-engineering of the components.

Reference-contexts: problem go away, in practice the most common formats can be identified relatively quickly, by doing the checks for the most common formats, and the checks that can be done in the shortest time, before making other checks. (More sophisticated optimizations of format identification are described by Schwarz et al <ref> [SS94] </ref>.) TOM's infrastructure also allows client programs to control carefully how thorough format checking should be.

Reference-contexts: A good example of this use is the Universal Library's Book Object <ref> [Thi96] </ref>, which supports several navigation and presentation controls for on-line books. In the Book Object, a central frame displays a book page, and surrounding frames show tables of contents, and allow users to turn the page, jump to a particular book section, or change the way the pages are displayed.

Reference-contexts: If this occurs, types 2 This philosophy is shared by other programming systems as well. For instance, the writers of the Perl manual note that "[i]n Perl culture... you're expected to stay out of someone's home because you weren't invited in, not because there are bars on the windows." <ref> [WCS96] </ref> 8.1. EXPRESSIVENESS 113 may behave in unexpected or erroneous ways. The design of TOM, however, makes some of these errors unlikely, and limits their effect when errors do occur. For instance, in Chapter 6, I showed how subtype relations can only be declared by the owner of the subtype.
