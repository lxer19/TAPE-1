Abstract: The paper describes recent progress in research on database system support for executing multimedia presentations. It proposes the general concept of Reactive Playout Management to adjust multimedia presentations. This adjustment can be required due to performance fluctuations as in the absence of end-to-end quality of service guarantees, cost constraints specified by the user, and other reasons. A concrete concept to realize Performance-Based Reactive Playout Management in distributed Multimedia Database Systems is proposed. This covers the identification of respective components in distributed database system architectures along with corresponding algorithms.

Reference-contexts: A prominent approach for executing multimedia presentations in distributed environments in the absence of end-to-end QoS guarantees is the use of buffer-level playout combined with a proper prefetching scheme for the multimedia data, e.g. <ref> [7, 3, 1] </ref>. We have reflected this in our proposal for PB-RPM by assuming a model (referred to as a presentation quality-based control model) which organizes the cooperation of the following processes according to a producer/consumer concept (Figure 1). <p> As part of our further joint research work, we will especially investigate how we can exploit this model of presentation quality for the purpose of PB-RPM in dis tributed MM-DBS. The notion of presentation quality is also considered in <ref> [1] </ref> in which the quality is dependent on the re sponse time of the presentation and the quality of the objects. Adaptive techniques for distributed multimedia presen tations have been studied by several other groups. Little and Ghafoor proposed an adaptive scheduling mechanism [6]. <p> Practical results of the usage of adaptive techniques for multimedia presentation executions have been reported, e.g., in [5] and [2]. More elaborate ideas based on [2] are presented in [4]. Also in <ref> [1] </ref>, work on the adaptive execu tion of multimedia presentations is described. In particular, it proposes Presentation and Retrieval Schedules. In com parison to our approach, we do not have explicit retrieval schedules.

Alternatively, presentation quality can also be defined from the viewpoint of the presentation authors. <p> Related Work Several efforts not specifically addressing MM-DBS are related to the presented work.

Reference-contexts: We identify concrete components and describe how they must work together to achieve PB-RPM. This proposal is an ex-tention of our general concept of Playout Management in distributed MM-DBS <ref> [12] </ref> that we have realized within the context of IPSI's AMOS system.

The development of AMOS is driven by experiences gathered by several concrete multimedia applications, e.g. [16, 15]. <p> This proposal is an ex-tention of our general concept of Playout Management in distributed MM-DBS [12] that we have realized within the context of IPSI's AMOS system.

Section 2 introduces PB-RPM independent of a concrete type of system. <p> The current presentation quality that the prefetch process supports is denoted by Q b . The current buffer level is denoted by B. An asynchronously running playout process handles the playout of the multimedia data <ref> [12] </ref> such that the executing presentation provides a current playout presentation quality denoted by Q p . In essence, this process manages the output devices according to Q p and user interactions. <p> Minimization of PB-RPM-overhead. The performance overhead imposed by the adaptive presentation service should be minimal. 4. Realization of PB-RPM in a Distributed MM-DBS For distributed MM-DBS, we introduced a novel service called playout management service <ref> [12, 15] </ref>. This service is targeted at executing arbitrarily composed multimedia presentations stored in a database. Taking this service as a basis, in the following, we present a concept to achieve PB-RPM in a MM-DBS. <p> For example, one alternative is that the PSM negotiates with the central database system environment for starting the presentation with a lowered performance demand. Multimedia Playout Manager (MPM). The MPM is responsible for the playout of the multimedia presentation to the user according to a requested presentation quality <ref> [12] </ref>. For example, when 100% presentation quality is requested (see Section 2.1) then the playout is precisely done as defined in the spatio-temporal definition. Otherwise, the play-out is done with deviations from the specification. Feasibility Predictor (FP). The FP tracks the best-effort delivery of the data to the presentation site.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 presents an approach for realizing PB-RPM in a distributed MM-DBS by a respective adaptive presentation service. Related work is discussed in section 5 and section 6 concludes the paper. 2. PB-RPM: Performance-Based Reactive Playout Management In general, RPM <ref> [13, 15, 14] </ref> is targeted at the adaptation of executing multimedia presentations. PB-RPM is one variant of RPM which strives at handling performance fluctuations by adaptations. With performance, we mean the performance to make the data available at the presentation sites, called data delivery performance. <p> Instead, they should potentially tackle several media presentations at the same time. This is advantageous since for many presentations, e.g., it is superior to have a necessary adaptation uniformly distributed over all component media presentations instead of only adapting one of them. In <ref> [13, 14] </ref>, we have proposed so-called adaptation schedules to achieve complex adaptations. Such adaptation schedules consist of a sequence of adaptation actions. Using the above definition of author-centered quality, an adaptation schedule that decreases presentation quality is called a d-adaptation schedule. <p> Local PB-RPM manages multimedia presentations from the viewpoint of a particular presentation instance. Thus, it deals with one such particular instance executing at a particular site. It determines and conducts a concrete adaptation of the given multimedia presentation, e.g., by generating and executing an adaptation schedule <ref> [13, 14] </ref>. This adaptation must lead to a change in the presentation's data demand as expected by global PB-RPM. With respect to a distributed architecture, global PB-RPM is performed at the central database environment. <p> This is anticipated when the actual buffer level B is lower than the safety level S and at the same time the throughput of the data delivery T has been too low for a certain period of time <ref> [13] </ref>. Given an anticipated Continuation Infeasibility, the FP issues the parameterized message CI (quantif infeas, cur pres qual) to the central database environment's PDA. 2 This frequency is dynamically changing and depends on the test results. <p> Demand Increase Feasibility is anticipated when an improvement of the current quality Q p below 100% is feasible. This is anticipated when B is beyond S and at the same time T has not been too low for a certain period of time <ref> [13] </ref>. Given an anticipated Demand Increase Feasibility, the FP issues the parameterized message DIF (quantif feas, cur pres qual) to the central database environment's PDA. The message parameters quantif infeas and quantif feas deliver the quantified infeasibility and quantified feasibility, respectively. Both are derived by heuristic approximation methods. <p> More elaborate ideas based on [2] are presented in [4]. Also in [1], work on the adaptive execu tion of multimedia presentations is described. In particular, it proposes Presentation and Retrieval Schedules. In com parison to our approach, we do not have explicit retrieval schedules. However, as described in <ref> [13] </ref>, our reactive con trol mechanism manipulates nominal buffer loading param eters according to the needs of the presentation specification. This manipulation is driven by an imaginary retrieval sched-ule. In the future, we might extend our approach by explicit retrieval schedules. Analogously, we also only have imaginary presentation schedules.

The optimization method proposed in <ref> [14] </ref> is one promissing approach which can be exploited in the context of the AM. Based on this approach, the AM generates and performs optimized adaptation schedules which adjust the operation of the MPM to a new presentation quality. <p> This manipulation is driven by an imaginary retrieval sched-ule. In the future, we might extend our approach by explicit retrieval schedules. Analogously, we also only have imaginary presentation schedules. Since, our work is more focusing on developing an optimization method for adapting a set of executing multimedia presentations <ref> [14] </ref>, we introduced the notion of adaptation schedule which can be seen as a highly complementory to the other schedule types of the above mentioned work. 6.
