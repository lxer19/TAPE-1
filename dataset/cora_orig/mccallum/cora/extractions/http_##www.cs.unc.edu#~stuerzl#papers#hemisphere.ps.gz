Abstract: Recent approaches to realistic image synthesis have split the rendering process into two passes. The first pass calculates an approximate global illumination solution, the second generates an image of high quality from a given view point using the illumination solution obtained in the first pass. This paper discusses a new method for projecting polygons onto the hemisphere which is the central operation performed for each pixel during the local pass. The method calculates an exact hemispherical projection of all polygons considering occlusion. The chosen representation of the projected polygons facilitates the fast and accurate computation of formfactors with regard to the projection center.

Reference-contexts: This allows to accurately compute the irradiance for surface points using the results of a global illumination solution. The hemisphere projection facilitates the calculation of the irradiance jacobian <ref> [Ar94] </ref>. All necessary quantities can be computed from the obtained projection onto the hemisphere. Using the irra-diance jacobian it should be possible to interpolate irradiance values in areas of the image where the irradiance varies slowly (see e.g. [WH92]).
