Title: FUNFITS: data analysis and statistical tools for estimating functions  
Author: Douglas Nychka, Barbara Bailey and Stephen Ellner Perry Haaland and Michael O'Connell 
Affiliation: North Carolina State University  Becton Dickinson Research Center  
Abstract: A module of functions has been created to simplify and extend the fitting of curves and surfaces to data. Some important applications include estimates of the mean value of a measured response over some space of interest, response surface methods for designed experiments and the modeling of nonlinear dynamic systems. The core methods that are implemented in FUNFITS include prediction, plot and summary functions that help the user interpret results and visualize the estimate. FUNFITS is written mainly in the S programming language with some support from FORTRAN subroutines. All source is available and easy to modify. fl Contact Address: Department of Statistics Box 8203, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695-8203.

Based on a first order Taylor series, these quantities measure the effect of a small perturbation on the state of the system a specific number of time steps into the future.

Reference-contexts: Under the assumption that f is a realization of a spatial process, p can be identified as the "spatial trend" or "drift" and h is modeled as a mean zero Gaussian process <ref> (Cressie 1991) </ref>. Spline and spatial process models are sensitive to the dimension of x because they attempt to represent all possible interactions among the different variables. <p> Letting K ij = k (x i ; x j ) the covariance matrix assumed for Y is K + 2 W 1 and under the assumption that and 2 are known one can estimate f (x) as the best linear, unbiased estimate for f based on Y <ref> (Cressie 1991, Welch et al. 1992) </ref>. Recall that the basic model assumes that the measurement errors are uncorrelated with the i th observation having a variance given by 2 =W i .

Reference-contexts: This operation assumes that on a standard scale the function has approximately the same smoothness in each dimension. Other scaling options are also supported. Although a more intensive approach is to estimate a separate smoothing scale for each variable by GCV <ref> (Gu 1991) </ref>, this extension has not been implemented in FUNFITS because of the additional computational burden. 5 Actually, the computations do not require that these be polynomial functions. 22 The roughness penalty matrix for thin plate splines reduces to the simple form: k;j = k (x fl j x fl and <p> In the case when M = one can avoid the first decomposition using the thin-plate spline algorithms of Bates et al. (1987) as implemented in the FUNFITS function tpsreg. In fact, even the second decomposition can avoided by working with tridiagonal systems <ref> (Gu 1991) </ref>. In either case, one must work with a complete set of basis functions and so even with this efficiency the computation of a thin plate spline is practically limited to several hundred observations (not counting replications).

Reference-contexts: One efficient strategy for representing f is as the sum of a low order polynomial and a smooth function: f (x) = p (x) + h (x) In the case of thin plate splines <ref> (Wahba 1990, Silverman and Green 1994) </ref> the degree of p implies a specific roughness penalty on h based on integrated squared (partial) derivatives.
