Abstract: Mayor is a real-time player of the popular simulation game SimCity. Since SimCity is a complex, dynamic world, players must make do with a partial understanding of how the world works. Mayor contends with an incomplete world model by using a case-based planner which repairs plans on expectation failures, and with experience can improve its case library. SimCity players must also be able to quickly prioritize many tasks, which range from short to long-term. Mayor uses utility estimates based on historical observation of the success of past tasks. This paper describes these approaches, and provides an overview of the Mayor architecture.
