Abstract: State of the art, real-time, rate-adaptive, multimedia applications adjust their transmission rate to match the available network capacity. Unfortunately, this source-based rate-adaptation performs poorly in a heterogeneous multicast environment because there is no single target rate the conflicting bandwidth requirements of all receivers cannot be simultaneously satisfied with one transmission rate. If the burden of rate-adaption is moved from the source to the receivers, heterogeneity is accommodated. One approach to receiver-driven adaptation is to combine a layered source coding algorithm with a layered transmission system. By selectively forwarding subsets of layers at constrained network links, each user receives the best quality signal that the network can deliver. We and others have proposed that selective-forwarding be carried out using multiple IP-Multicast groups where each receiver specifies its level of subscription by joining a subset of the groups. In this paper, we extend the multiple group framework with a rate-adaptation protocol called Receiver-driven Layered Multicast, or RLM. Under RLM, multicast receivers adapt to both the static heterogeneity of link bandwidths as well as dynamic variations in network capacity (i.e., congestion). We describe the RLM protocol and evaluate its performance with a preliminary simulation study that characterizes user-perceived quality by assessing loss rates over multiple time scales. For the configurations we simulated, RLM results in good throughput with transient short-term loss rates on the order of a few percent and long-term loss rates on the order of one percent. Finally, we discuss our implementation of a software-based Internet video codec and its integration with RLM. Copyright c fl 1995 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.

Reference-contexts: In this open-loop approach, the sender broadcasts at some fixed rate without regard to changing network conditions. A better approach is to adjust the transmission rate to match the available capacity in the network, i.e., to react to congestion. Pioneering research in rate-adaptive video <ref> [1, 19, 23] </ref> has shown that this is feasible, but unfortunately, in the context of multicast, the notion of network capacity is ill defined. A control scheme that adjusts the rate of a single stream at the source simply cannot meet the conflicting requirements of a set of heterogeneous receivers. <p> A controller uses this information to adjust the output rate of the source coder, allowing the source to react to queue buildup before packet loss occurs. These source-based rate-adaptation schemes are poorly matched to multicast environments. QMTP [34] and the IVS congestion control scheme <ref> [1] </ref> adapt by soliciting feedback from the receivers in a scalable fashion, but these schemes do not cope well with bandwidth heterogeneity. Either low-capacity regions of the distribution are overwhelmed or high-capacity regions are underutilized.

Receivers drop down to the 160x120 resolution when they detect high packet loss rates. Concurrent with our work, Hoffman and Speer have built a similar system based on the layered multicast architecture [20].

Reference-contexts: Our goal is to design, build, and evaluate all of the components that contribute to a scalable video transmission system, ensuring that the pieces of the design interact well with each other. To this end, our system is based on Clark and Tennenhouse's Application Level Framing (ALF) protocol architecture <ref> [5] </ref>. While ALF says that an application's semantics should be reflected in the design of its network protocol, we further believe that the network's semantics should also be reflected in the application design.

Reference-contexts: Ns is an event-driven packet-level simulator controlled and configured via Tcl [27]. Shortest-path routes are computed for the input topology and multicast packets are routed via reverse-path forwarding. A flooding algorithm similar to Dense-mode Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) <ref> [7] </ref> handles forwarding and pruning of multicast flows. Hierarchical sources are modeled as a set of constant-bit rate (CBR) streams with fixed packet sizes.

Reference-contexts: The simplest solution to this problem is to distribute a uniform representation of the signal to all interested receivers using IP Multicast <ref> [8] </ref>. Unfortunately, this is suboptimal low-capacity regions of the network suffer congestion while high-capacity regions are underutilized. The problems posed by heterogeneity are not just theoretical, they impact our daily use of Internet remote-conferencing. For example, each week for the past year, U.C.

Reference-contexts: Berkeley has broadcast a seminar over their campus network and onto the Internet. As depicted in Figure 1, a video application is run on a seminar host that sources a single-rate signal at 128 kb/s, the nominal rate for video over the Internet Multicast Backbone, or MBone <ref> [11] </ref>. However, a number of users on the local campus network have high bandwidth connectivity and would prefer to receive higher-rate, higher-quality video. At the other bandwidth extreme, many users have ISDN access and would like to participate from home, but a 128 kb/s video stream overwhelms an ISDN line.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, to allow receivers to correlate join-experiments with resulting congestion periods, the network must instantiate a new flow expediently. In the case of IP Multicast, the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) <ref> [12] </ref> carries out both of these operations on reasonable time scales. When a receiver joins a new group, the host immediately informs the next-hop router, which in turn, immediately propagates a graft message up the multicast distribution tree in order to instantiate the new group.

Reference-contexts: In this case, RLM adaptation is not necessary. On the other hand, if the granularity of resource management were not as fine-grained, then RLM adaptation within an integrated services environment might still make sense. For example, Class Based Queuing (CBQ) <ref> [16] </ref> could be used to provide an adaptive-rate video traffic class with some specified bandwidth. Then within this CBQ class, video sessions could contend for the aggregate class bandwidth using RLM. This approach has the desirable side effect that RLM is shielded from interactions with other protocols.

The RLM framework could be combined with the Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) protocol <ref> [17] </ref> in the LBNL whiteboard, wb, to optimize the latency of rate-controlled transmissions. Because SRM uses a token-bucket rate-controller, it has the same limitations that single-layer video has in heterogeneous environments.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this simple model fails to capture the burstiness of real video streams <ref> [18] </ref>. Because convergence in RLM relies on matching the layered rates to available capacity, smooth sources are well-behaved and this traffic model is overly optimistic. On the other hand, a bursty source can be smoothed out by applying rate-control through adaptive quantization at the cost of variable quality.

They proposed an end-to-end design that uses explicit feedback from the receiver to throttle the video transmission rate at the source.

Reference-contexts: RLM alone does not provide fairness. In general it is not possible to achieve a fair allocation of bandwidth without some additional machinery in the network, even if all the end-nodes cooperate <ref> [22] </ref>. But, if machinery for fairness is added to the network, RLM should work effectively in concert with it. Similar circumstance surrounds the design of TCP. TCP congestion control works well in isolation but in aggregation can be unfair [13].

Reference-contexts: We can avoid these problems by scaling down the individual join-experiment rates in proportion to the overall group size. In other words, we can fix the aggregate join-experiment rate independent of session size much as RTCP scales back its control message rate in proportion to the group size <ref> [28] </ref>. However, reducing the experiment rate in this manner decreases the learning rate. For large groups, the algorithm will take too long to converge. Our solution is shared learning: Before a receiver conducts a join-experiment, it notifies the entire group by mul-ticasting a message identifying the experimental layer. <p> To scale to large session sizes, T max J is dynamically adjusted in proportion to the number of receivers. The number of receivers is in turn dynamically estimated through the exchange of session-wide control messages (e.g., as in RTCP <ref> [28] </ref>). Thus the aggregate join-experiment rate is fixed, independent of the session size, and packet loss induced by join-experiments does not increase with session size. The join-timer undergoes relaxation in steady-state. <p> We are currently implementing RLM and our layered codec in the UCB/LBNL video conferencing tool vic [25]. Vic's network transport is based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) <ref> [28] </ref>, an application level protocol for multimedia transport standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force. Although RTP has proven to be a solid foundation for interoperable real-time audio/video applications, it was designed without any explicit notion of a layered signal representation. <p> Using this property, we can partition the bit-rate arbitrarily among layers and vary this allocation dynamically, from frame to frame or slowly over time. As an optimization, we can use scalable, low-rate feedback from the receivers (e.g., as provided by RTCP <ref> [28] </ref>) to tailor the rate allocation to the environment. For example, if the entire session is connected at high-rate, but one user is connected at ISDN rate, we could produce a two-layer stream rather than a higher-complexity multi-layer stream.

Reference-contexts: In all of our simulations, the link bandwidths are 1.5 Mb/s, the traffic sources are modeled as a six-layer CBR stream at rates 32 fi 2 m kb/s; m = 0 : : : 5, and the start-time of each receiver is randomly chosen uniformly on the interval <ref> [30; 120] </ref> seconds. The protocol constants from Table 1 have the following values: ff = 2, fi = 2=3, k 1 = 1, k 2 = 2, g 1 = 0:25, g 2 = 0:25, T min J = 600 sec. <p> Tcl runs the adaptation algorithm and manipulates IP Multicast group membership via downcalls back to C++. 7 Related Work The idea that the rate of an information source can be adjusted by degrading reconstruction quality was born in rate-distortion theory first developed by Shannon <ref> [30] </ref>. The rate-distortion framework forms the bedrock of traditional video codec design, where codec parameters (i.e., compression quality) are dynamically adjusted to match the transmission rate of a CBR communications channel.

Reference-contexts: Although RTP has proven to be a solid foundation for interoperable real-time audio/video applications, it was designed without any explicit notion of a layered signal representation. In joint work, we have extended RTP for layered stream delivery <ref> [31] </ref> and are currently implementing our proposed changes in vic. Since the RLM protocol processing is not in the fast path, run-time performance is not critical. In fact, our prototype is implemented almost entirely in the interpreted language Tcl [27].

Reference-contexts: A control scheme that adjusts the rate of a single stream at the source simply cannot meet the conflicting requirements of a set of heterogeneous receivers. An alternative approach is to combine a layered compression algorithm with a layered transmission scheme <ref> [29, 32] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: While much of the previous work leaves this as an implementation detail, a novel mechanism based on IP Multicast was suggested by Deering [6] and elaborated on and/or independently reported in <ref> [4, 9, 20, 26, 33] </ref>. In this approach, the different layers of the hierarchical signal are striped across multiple multicast groups and receivers adapt to congestion by adding and dropping layers (i.e., joining and leaving multicast groups). <p> The authors do not discuss adaptation algorithms or report any implementation results. Deering first suggested that the IP Multicast be used as a layered transmission system where layers are individually mapped onto multicast groups [6]. Both Chaddha and Gupta [4] and Bolot and Turletti <ref> [33] </ref> describe this architecture but do not present an adaptation algorithm or implementation. Brown et al. have implemented a multi-resolution extension to the CU-SeeMe video conferencing system where IP Multicast receivers can subscribe to either a 160x120 or a 320x240 stream by joining either one or two multicast groups [2].

Reference-contexts: A controller uses this information to adjust the output rate of the source coder, allowing the source to react to queue buildup before packet loss occurs. These source-based rate-adaptation schemes are poorly matched to multicast environments. QMTP <ref> [34] </ref> and the IVS congestion control scheme [1] adapt by soliciting feedback from the receivers in a scalable fashion, but these schemes do not cope well with bandwidth heterogeneity. Either low-capacity regions of the distribution are overwhelmed or high-capacity regions are underutilized.

Reference-contexts: They use multiple frame rates of JPEG video to generate a temporal hierarchy and employ two techniques for adaptation. Their first technique is a negotiation algorithm run by each receiver that obtains the highest available quality of service explicitly from the network (e.g., using RSVP <ref> [35] </ref>).
