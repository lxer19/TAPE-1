Reference-contexts: Proof. Recall that if M 1 ; : : : ; M t are distinct positive numbers then any t fi t subdeterminant of the r fi t matrix (M j s ) 1st; 1jr is non-singular (c.f., <ref> [5] </ref>). Since the black box gives output based on an irreducible representation of f , we see that any zero of the denominator of such a representation is zero of the denominator of a (t 1 ; t 2 )-sparse representation of f .
