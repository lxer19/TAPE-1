Abstract: Natural kinds, such as the concepts toy block or photosynthesis, are ubiquitous in human reasoning yet lack definitional (i.e., individually necessary and jointly sufficient) properties as membership conditions. We want to represent a wide variety of assertions about these natural concepts with precision and logical consistency. Furthermore, we want to be able to verify that the meaning of each concept does not conflict with the constraints implied by its constituents. Classification-based approaches to these tasks have relied on definitional properties in order to deduce subsumption and thus detect inconsistency. These approaches are inapplicable for building representations of natural concepts. Our solution to these problems is twofold. First, we build KBs by iterative refinement; i.e., the KB is constructed through a sequence of editing operations. Second, we define practical, yet formal, properties of concept satisfiability and inheritance that each operator is guaranteed to preserve. When the user builds representations of concepts using the operators, guard procedures ensure that existing concepts are used in a manner consistent with their meaning. We also discuss the computational complexity of guarding consistency, and the characteristics of the system that we believe make these computations practical in an interactive setting.

Reference-contexts: The weakness is that since our system does not automatically classify concepts into subsumption hierarchies, it cannot discover all inconsistencies in the KB. The strength is that it need not perform the intractable computations that can result from this feature. (See Appendix A of <ref> (Borgida & Patel-Schneider 1994) </ref> for an example of such intractability.) These computations can still be performed in the background, without requiring potentially large delays in response time to the user. <p> Approaches based on description logic can be divided into those that emphasize completeness and those that emphasize expressiveness. The basic core of the widely-used CLASSIC system emphasizes completeness and tractability of inference <ref> (Borgida & Patel-Schneider 1994) </ref>. However, the expressiveness of such languages is limited to a subset of first-order logic for which logical entailment can always be computed in polynomial time. For examples of useful knowledge that cannot be expressed under this restriction, see (Doyle & Patil 1991).

Reference-contexts: Some work in the field of description logics 3 The instances seafood (s 1 ), person (p 1 ), eaten-by (s 1 , p 1 ) satisfy the seafood definition because there is no way to deduce vegetarian (p 1 ) or meat-eater (p 1 ). <ref> (Brachman & Schmolze 1985) </ref> has addressed both practical and theoretical issues. Approaches based on description logic can be divided into those that emphasize completeness and those that emphasize expressiveness. The basic core of the widely-used CLASSIC system emphasizes completeness and tractability of inference (Borgida & Patel-Schneider 1994).

Reference-contexts: However, the expressiveness of such languages is limited to a subset of first-order logic for which logical entailment can always be computed in polynomial time. For examples of useful knowledge that cannot be expressed under this restriction, see <ref> (Doyle & Patil 1991) </ref>. Systems have combined the expressiveness of description logics and Horn clause rules (Levy & Rousset. 1996), but the focus of this work is on trading expressive power for completeness rather than trading completeness for limited consistency guarantees.

Reference-contexts: Much work in knowledge acquisition assumes a task model, and uses the model to test the contents of the knowledge base for undesirable conditions. For example, the EXPECT system <ref> (Gil & Melz 1996) </ref> ensures that the knowledge base contains the structures needed by the problem solving methods declared to the system.

Reference-contexts: In the field of expert systems, analysis or verification of OPS-style production rule bases with various practical goals has been investigated, for example in <ref> (Ginsberg & Williamson 1993) </ref>. However, inference in these systems is defined procedurally rather than in terms of first-order predicate calculus semantics. Other work on detecting inconsistencies includes verification of propositional (Ginsberg 1988), or extended propositional (Rousset 1988), knowledge bases. 7.

Reference-contexts: By contrast, the LOOM representation system emphasizes expressiveness at the expense of completeness <ref> (MacGregor 1991) </ref>. This system includes a plethora of descriptive forms and supports numerous inference methods, including several approaches to classification. In addition to representing facts, LOOM supports specification of procedural reasoning methods and production rules.

Reference-contexts: For these reasons we believe that the complexity will be generally independent of the number of concepts defined in the KB. 6. Related Work Our view of knowledge representation shares many characteristics with Conceptual Graphs <ref> (Sowa 1984) </ref>. The use of canonical forms in that work enforces syntactic constraints on how concepts can be built. However, since our main thrust is supporting iterative refinement of knowledge, we avoid using lambda-calculus interfaces to concept definitions.
