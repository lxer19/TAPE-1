Abstract: Summary. This paper contains two fast algorithms for inversion of Chebyshev-Vander-monde matrices of the first and second kind. They are based on special representations of the Bezoutians of Chebyshev polynomials of both kinds. The paper also contains the results of numerical experiments which show that the algorithms proposed here are not only much faster, but also more stable than other algorithms available. It is also efficient to use the above two algorithms for solving Chebyshev-Vandermode systems of equations with preprocessing.

Reference-contexts: The concept of polynomial Vandermonde matrix is a generalization of the ordinary Vandermonde matrix, where P i () = i . For ordinary Vandermonde matrices the number of fast algorithms is available for solving linear systems ( Bjorck and Pereyra <ref> (1970) </ref>, Tang and Golub (1981); Gohberg, Kailath, Koltracht and Lancaster (1987)) and for inversion ( Traub (1966), Heinig and Rost (1984), Gohberg and Koltracht (1991).

In this case algorithm G-O produces approximately the same error as Gauss (and slightly lower than NH and R-O), while it works significantly faster. In other examples considered algorithm Gauss failed.
