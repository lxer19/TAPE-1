Reference-contexts: Since 2SAT can be solved in linear time [1,6], we obtain the following result. Theorem 3 Algorithm 1 solves the reconstruction problem for hv-convex poly-ominoes in time O (mn min (m 2 ; n 2 )). 4 An implementation (see <ref> [5] </ref>) of Algorithm 1 can be made more efficient by reducing the number of choices for k; l. First, restrict k to multiples of c 1 , and l to multiples of c n .

Reference-contexts: Given a finite number of such measurements, we wish to reconstruct T or, if unique reconstruction is not possible, to compute any object consistent with these projections. Gardner et al. <ref> [7] </ref> proved that deciding if there is an object consistent with given measurements is NP-complete, even for three non-parallel projections in the 2D grid. In this paper we address the case of orthogonal (horizontal and vertical) projections of a 2D grid.
