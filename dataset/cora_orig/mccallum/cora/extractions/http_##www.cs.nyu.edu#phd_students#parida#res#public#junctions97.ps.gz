Title: Junctions: Detection, Classification and Reconstruction  
Author: Laxmi Parida, Davi Geiger, Robert Hummel, 
Note: To appear in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI).  
Abstract: Junctions are important features for image analysis and form a critical aspect of image understanding tasks such as object recognition. We present a unified approach to detecting (location of the center of the junction), classifying (by the number of wedges lines, corners, 3-junctions such as T or Y junctions, or 4-junctions such as X-junctions) and reconstructing junctions (in terms of radius size, the angles of each wedge and the intensity in each of the wedges) in images. Our main contribution is a modeling of the junction which is complex enough to handle all these issues and yet simple enough to admit an effective dynamic programming solution. Broadly, we use a template deformation framework along with a gradient criterium to detect radial partitions of the template. We use the minimum description length principle to obtain the optimal number of partitions that best describes the junction. Kona [27] is an implementation of this model. We (quantitatively) demonstrate the stability and robustness of the detector by analyzing its behavior in the presence of noise, using synthetic/controlled apparatus. We also present a qualitative study of its behavior on real images.

Reference-contexts: Such points, for example, coincide with the images of trihedral vertices of an object. These are critical features for recognition as suggested by [6, 7, 33]. They are also critical features for motion as suggested by Walach experiments [34] and by Movshon and Adelson <ref> [1] </ref>. A study of the role of junctions in stereo is presented in Malik [21].

Reference-contexts: A study of the role of junctions in stereo is presented in Malik [21]. There have been basically two different views/approaches for detecting junctions: edge detection followed by grouping of edges to form junctions <ref> [25, 24, 4, 2, 13] </ref>, and, treating a junction as a template matching phenomenon [8, 12, 15]. In the former, it is assumed that the presence (or absence) of a junction is determined by "grouping" the intensity gradients near a hypothesized junction.

To test the stability/robustness of the detector we have experimentally analyzed its behavior for the location and junction parameters against noise. We used a synthetic/controlled apparatus for a quantitative study.

In a Wallach type of experiment, junctions occur due to the intersection of lines, and, junctions move due to the movement of the lines. The results of the experiments in [34] seem to suggest that junctions are detected although there is a small gap (R 0 ) between the lines. Estimating the location: We do the following to select the best location in an image region 2 .

Reference-contexts: The radius of the disk addresses the "scale" issue, and the location of the center is a kind of "interest operator" [11] that determines the position where the feature is located in a region, possibly pre-defined. Another corner-detector <ref> [35] </ref> performs a similar role of detecting locations that have a corner. This uses a predetermined window/mask on each pixel and compares the intensity of every pixel with that of the center of the mask to determine whether there is a corner at the location.
