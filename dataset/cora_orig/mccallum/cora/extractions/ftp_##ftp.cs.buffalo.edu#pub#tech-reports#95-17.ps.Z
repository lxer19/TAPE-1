Title: Efficient algorithms for a scheduling problem and its applications to illicit drug market crackdowns  
Author: Pu Cai Jin-yi Cai Ashish V. Naik 
Keyword: key words: job scheduling problem, drug market crackdown scheduling problem, duality, polynomial time algorithm, quasipolynomial time approximation algorithm.  
Abstract: We give polynomial time algorithms for a job scheduling problem. By duality we transform a special case of the drug market crackdown scheduling problem to the above job scheduling problem and thus derive polynomial time algorithms to the second problem. Finally, using the algorithm for the special case, we develop a quasipolynomial time approximation algorithm for the general case of the drug market crackdown scheduling problem with monomial cost functions.

Reference-contexts: We then show that the schedule yielded by this algorithm is good enough to approximate within a factor of 1 + * of the optimal. Let r = dlog (p (n)) 1e, and a = p (n) 2 r+1 . (Observe that a 1.) We first divide the interval <ref> [1; p (n)] </ref> into r + 1 many half-open intervals [a; 3a]; (3a; 7a]; ; ((2 r 1)a; p (n)]. Next, we subdivide each of the intervals ((2 s 1)a; (2 s+1 1)a] into 1=* 0 -many subintervals of equal size. <p> For all i, let w 0 i denote the maintenance level of market i in I 0 . We claim that for all i, w i &lt; w 0 i +2* 0 w 0 i . To see this, recall our subdivision of the interval <ref> [1; p (n)] </ref>. For all s, the length of the s th interval is a 2 s and the smallest value in the s th interval is a (2 s 1). Furthermore, each subinterval in the s th interval is of length a * 0 2 s . <p> Given * &gt; 0 and an instance I of the Crackdown Scheduling problem with n drug markets f1; 2; : : :; ng, let p (n) be a polynomial such that the maintenance level of every market is less than p (n).

Next, partition each small interval into 1 * 0 -many equal sized intervals, where * <p> Partition the interval [1; p (n)] into log (p (n)) many smaller intervals <ref> [1; 3] </ref>; (3; 7]; (7; 15]; : : :(2 dlog (p (n))e1 1; p (n)] (hence the s th interval is of length 2 s .)

Reference-contexts: In recent years U.S. drug control policy has given increasing attention to local drug enforcement. A currently favored local enforcement strategy|crackdowns, increases police activity in an area to increase the threat of apprehension. Most cities, however, have more than one street corner drug market. In this case, theoretical models <ref> [4, 2] </ref> and practical experience [6] have indicated that a successful crackdown operation on a drug market needs to be followed by a maintenance phase to prevent the drug market from "springing back." The resource requirement for the maintenance phase is typically much less than that of the initial crackdown phase. <p> The NP-hardness of the problem assumes that the response function of each market is an arbitrary monotonically increasing function. Lack of reliable data [11] makes estimation of the exact nature of the response function very difficult. However, practical evidence <ref> [2, 7] </ref> indicates that most real response functions are convex functions, and in fact a simple monomial of the form f i (x) = m i x fi + c i , with appropriate m i ; c i ; fi, provides a good approximation to a convex response function.

Reference-contexts: Taking these factors into consideration, Naik et al. <ref> [10] </ref> developed an analytical framework for specifying the sequence in which crackdowns should be initiated on several drug markets in a city to minimize the total cost. They formulated the above problem as the Crackdown Scheduling problem, which can be described as follows. <p> Let (i) denote the ith market scheduled for crackdown, the cost of the schedule , denoted by C (), is given by the following expression C () = j=1 P j1 We want to find a schedule of crackdowns such that C () is minimized. Naik et al. <ref> [10] </ref> showed that the crackdown scheduling problem is NP-complete. They also showed that some strongly restricted versions of this problem can be solved in polynomial time. The NP-hardness of the problem assumes that the response function of each market is an arbitrary monotonically increasing function.
