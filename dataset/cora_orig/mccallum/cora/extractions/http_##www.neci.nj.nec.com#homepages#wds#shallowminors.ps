Abstract: In this paper we introduce the notion of the limited-depth minor exclusion and show that graphs that exclude small limited-depth minors have relatively small separators. In particular, we prove that for any graph that excludes K h as a depth l minor, we can find a separator of size O(lh 2 log n + n=l). This, in turn, implies that any graph that excludes K h as a minor has an O(h n log n)-sized separator, improving the result of Alon, Seymour, and Thomas for the case where We show that the d-dimensional simplicial graphs with constant aspect ratio, defined by Miller and Thurston, exclude K h minors of depth L for h = Our proof of separator existence is constructive and gives an algorithm to find the t-cut-covers decomposition, introduced by Kaklamanis, Krizanc, and Rao, in graphs that exclude small depth minors. This has two interesting implications. First, combination of our t-cut-cover algorithm with the results of Kaklamanis et al., gives a way to implement many finite element computations in three or more dimensions on a hy-percubic parallel computer with asymptotically maximal speedup. Second, by combining the t-cut-cover algorithm with the techniques developed by Leiserson, Rao and Toledo, gives an algorithm to asymptotically improve the external memory traffic used by any out h

In this paper we modify the approach of [2] to yield a number of results. <p> The main new concept in this paper is the notion of a "limited depth" minor. A minor H in a graph 1 According to a private communication from N.Alon, the authors of <ref> [2] </ref> recently observed that by applying some of the results in the Graph Minors papers one can show the existence of a separator of size h p n + c (h), for some (extremely fast growing) function c (h) that depends only on h. <p> G has depth l if each node in H corresponds to a connected component in G having diameter l. 2 We describe an algorithm based on the approach of <ref> [2] </ref> that given a graph G either outputs an O (lh 2 log n + n=l)- size separator or outputs a K h -minor of G with depth l. The algorithm is fast and simple. The importance of this new concept can be illustrated by the following simple example. <p> Consider a graph that is a square of a bounded-degree planar graph. The theory of graph minors is of little use for such graphs, since they can have K h as a minor for h = ( n). The Alon et al. bound <ref> [2] </ref> in this case would be O (n 5=4 ), which is meaningless since any graph has a linear-size separator. On the other hand, such graphs do not contain limited depth minors of depth O fl (n 1=4 ) and size O fl (n 1=4 ). <p> Our results then imply that they have O fl (n 3=4 ) separators. 3 Actually these graphs have O ( p n) sized separators; we are merely using this as an example in which our results improve on those of <ref> [2] </ref> and in which minors are less useful than limited depth minors. An important class of graphs that exclude large shallow-depth minors are constant-dimension simplicial graphs with constant aspect ratio defined by Miller and Thurston [19]. These graphs come from d-dimensional finite element computations. <p> An appropriate choice of the depth l yields the following result, which is an improvement of the bound in <ref> [2] </ref> for h = ( log n). <p> We refer the reader to <ref> [7, 18, 2] </ref> for numerous separator-related applications. The first application is developed in [12], where they show that n-node graphs that have appropriate cut-covers can be emulated in n-node hypercubes with constant slowdown or in n-node butterflies with O (log fl n) slowdown.
