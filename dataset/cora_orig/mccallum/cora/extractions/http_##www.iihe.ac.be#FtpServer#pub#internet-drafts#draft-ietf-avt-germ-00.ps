Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction When RTP <ref> [1] </ref> is used for end-to-end communication, each RTP data stream in a session should be send separately to a different UDP port. This allows heterogeneous treatment of the streams by the network.

Reference-contexts: This allows heterogeneous treatment of the streams by the network. For example, in a multimedia conference, we may be willing to pay to make an RSVP <ref> [2] </ref> reservation for the audio, but unable to reserve sufficient bandwidth for the video. Thus in the general case, we argue that multiplexing multiple RTP streams together should be avoided. However, there are circumstances when this general rule may not make a great deal of sense.

Reference-contexts: However, there are circumstances when this general rule may not make a great deal of sense. If a stream is very low bandwidth, but needs low latency, the overhead of RTP packetisation may be too large. On slow modem links this can be overcome by using IP/UDP/RTP header compression <ref> [3] </ref>, but this is a hop-by-hop compression scheme, and so is unsuitable for congested high-speed backbone links. MPEG 4 is an example of a codec that produces multiple elementary streams that comprise a single video stream. Many of these elementary streams are very low bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: Instead a network-aware multiplexing layer is required that can combine multiple elementary stream data units into a single RTP packet in a way that does not reduce resilience to packet loss <ref> [4] </ref>. Another example is that of IP telephony gateways. In such a gateway, incoming PSTN calls are pack-etised over RTP and transmitted to a remote gateway, where they are turned back into PSTN calls again. Between any pair of gateways there may be many simultaneous telephone calls.
