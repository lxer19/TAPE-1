Abstract: This paper presents the extension package developed by the author at the Faculty of Sciences and Technology of the New University of Lisbon, designed for experimentation with Coarse-Grained Distributed Genetic Algorithms (DGA). The package was implemented as an extension to the Basic Sugal system, developed by Andrew Hunter at the University of Sunderland, U.K., which is primarily intended to be used in the research of Sequential or Serial Genetic Algorithms (SGA).

Reference-contexts: master pro cess at specific time steps are: * fitness statistics of the global population: minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation of the fitnesses of all individuals in all the demes; * performance statistics of the global population: online and o*ine performance values, as de fined by the author in <ref> [1] </ref>. 4 Future Work The next step is to develop an interactive graphical front-end to PSugal (as the Interactive Sugal in [3]), in order to allow for a more user-friendly control of the parameter settings.

Reference-contexts: All control parameters may be modified, except for the global parallel parameters. PSugal is written in ANSI C, and uses the PVM programming interface for implementing the migration operator. It was tested on Linux and Dec Alpha's OSF, and is available by anonymous ftp from ftp://gaia.di.fct.unl.pt/pub/src/linux/ga/sugal. <ref> [2] </ref>. 3.2 Statistical Output PSugal does not have its own print facilities. Statistics can be output to files and imported into any application that understands TAB-separated columnar data. PSugal presents various statistics.

Reference-contexts: The configuration files contain settings for most known GA control parameters. This paper will only refer to the parameters which control the parallel behavior of PSugal. All other parameters are described in the SUGAL User Manual <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.1 Control parameters The parallel behavior of PSugal is controlled by (see * global parameters number of demes: each deme is numbered sequentially starting at 0; topology: each deme mantains two arrays: one with the numbers of the demes to which to send emigrants, and another with the numbers of <p> Statistics can be output to files and imported into any application that understands TAB-separated columnar data. PSugal presents various statistics. Besides the local statistics generated by the Basic Sugal running on and concerning each deme <ref> [3] </ref>, that may be output to files identified by the deme number -, PSugal may generate global statistics, which were gathered by a master process from each of the deme processes. <p> by each Sugal running on the demes, after a generation or an epoch, are: * fitness statistics of the population: minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation of the (unnormalised) fitnesses in the deme's subpop ulation; * diversity statistics of the population: its mean ing varies according to the datatype (see <ref> [3] </ref>). * performance statistics of the population: online and o*ine performance values, as defined by De Jong in [4]; * fitness statistics of the immigrant waiting list: is equivalent to the population fitness statistics, but applied to the individuals in the im migrant waiting list; * diversity statistics of the immigrant <p> of the fitnesses of all individuals in all the demes; * performance statistics of the global population: online and o*ine performance values, as de fined by the author in [1]. 4 Future Work The next step is to develop an interactive graphical front-end to PSugal (as the Interactive Sugal in <ref> [3] </ref>), in order to allow for a more user-friendly control of the parameter settings. Furthermore, the experience gained during the implementation of this interface, will allow us to study the integration of a dynamic control system.
