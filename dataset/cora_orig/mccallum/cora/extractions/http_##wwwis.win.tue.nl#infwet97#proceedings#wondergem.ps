Abstract: This article proposes an electronic commerce paradigm for agent-based Information Discovery (ID). ID is the synthesis of Information Retrieval and Information Filtering, thus coping with dynamics from both fields. Agent technology, having a number of valuable properties to attack problems with dynamics, is used in ID, resulting in a paradigm with three types of agents: user, broker, and source agents. Cooperation, which is the keyword for the agents to fullfil ID tasks, is seen as negotiation, thus obtaining a very general and flexible way to describe agents' interaction. The possibilities for ID agents to negotiate are investigated. In addition, remarks stemming from the ID background are made about other issues concerning negotiation such as protocols, strategies, and coordination.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction to Agent-Based Information Discovery Information Discovery (ID) (see [WBHW97b]) is the synthesis of Information Retrieval (IR) and Information Filtering (IF). For a comparison of IR and IF see <ref> [BC92] </ref>. In ID, we consider a population of users having dynamic information needs. These information needs are to be satisfied with information out of dynamic information sources. To facilitate this process, information brokers act as intermediaries between users and sources.

Reference-contexts: In a non-negotiating way, MetaSearch 3 and MetaCrawler 4 are examples of the lat ter. 3. Source agents can cooperate if the information they carry is complementary or related, for instance. This can result in a struc ture not unlike a hyperindex (see e.g. <ref> [Bru93] </ref>). Team formation is initiated by an agent incapable of achieving its goal or not making enough profit on its own. The agent has to search for agents with similar goals, so as to form a common goal which is supported by all the members of the team.

Reference-contexts: Additional research is needed for further investigation, but also for implementing and testing the ideas. On a theoretical basis, a classification of ID system can be made according to the types of negotiation they support. In this way, an ID system can said to be embedded (see <ref> [Hui96] </ref>) in another if the second system supports at least all the negotiation forms of the first.

Reference-contexts: The costs of information can be defined in terms of access-costs, transportation costs, complexity costs, etc. In addition, broker agents will also charge their clients. By negotiating, the agents in the ID paradigm form a dynamic economic market. For another multi-agent ID application see <ref> [Mar97] </ref>. The goal of this article is to show how electronic commerce can serve as the basis of an Information Discovery paradigm when negotiating agents are used. Section 2 investigates the possibilities for negotiation amongst agents in the ID paradigm.

Reference-contexts: The type of messages sent during communication should carry all the information needed in the protocol used. The Contract Net Protocol, for instance, is not viable since it cannot cope properly with open environments (dynamics of multiple negotiations in ID) and bounded rationality (see <ref> [SL95] </ref>). An extension by Sandholm and Lesser supplies abstract payment and commitment functions. These will properly have to be filled in for the ID context. Payment can be defined in terms of complexity, efficiency, accuracy, etc.

Reference-contexts: To facilitate this process, information brokers act as intermediaries between users and sources. Brokers compare the wishes of users with the available information in the sources. that it is not possible for users to communicate directly with the information sources. Since agent technology (see e.g. <ref> [WJ95] </ref>) fits well in the ID paradigm (especially communication, intelligence, and proactiveness), the entities of the paradigm are seen as agents: user agents, broker agents, and source agents, respectively.
