Abstract: Let S(n) be a collection of subsets of f1; :::; ng. In this paper we study numerical obstructions to the existence of orderings of S(n) for which the cardinalities of successive subsets satisfy congruence conditions. Gray code orders provide an example of such orderings. We say that an ordering of S(n) is a Gray code order if successive subsets differ by the adjunction or deletion of a single element of f1; : : : ; ng. The cardinalities of successive subsets in a Gray code order must alternate in parity. It follows that if d(S(n)) is the difference between the number of elements of S(n) having even (resp. odd) cardinality, then jd(S(n))j 1 is a lower bound for the cardinality of the complement of any subset of S(n) which can be listed in Gray code order. For g 2, the collection B(n; g) of g-block free subsets of f1; : : : ; ng is defined to be the set of all subsets S of f1; : : : ; ng such that ja bj g if a; b 2 S and a 6= b. We will construct a Gray code order for B(n; 2). In contrast, for g &gt; 2 we find the precise (positive) exponential growth rate of d(B(n; g)) with n as n ! 1. This implies B(n; g) is far from being listable in Gray code order if n is large. Analogous results for other kinds of orderings of subsets of B(n; g) are proved using generalizations of d(B(n; g)) . However, we will show that for all g, one can order B(n; g) so that successive elements differ by the adjunction and/or deletion of an integer from f1; : : : ; ng. We show that, over an A-letter alphabet, the words of length n which contain no block of k consecutive letters cannot, in general, be listed so that successive words differ by a single letter. However, if k &gt; 2 and A &gt; 2 or if k = 2 and A &gt; 3, such a listing is always possible.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 7.3 then follows from Lemma 8.5.2. To produce a lower bound of the form (8.13), we will use the following result of Fel'dman <ref> [2] </ref> about linear forms in logarithms of algebraic numbers. (Stronger results about linear forms in logarithms are available, but to keep the statement of Theorem 7.2 simple we will leave it to the reader to consider the resulting refinements.) 16 TED CHINBURG, CARLA D.

Reference-contexts: For instance when n = 3 we have the list S = ff;g; f1g; f1; 2g; f2g; f2; 3g; f1; 2; 3g; f1; 3g; f3gg which is an example of the family of codes that was originally found by Frank Gray <ref> [4] </ref>. One recognizes at once that we are simply asking if a certain graph has a Hamil-ton path or not, a notoriously difficult problem in graph theory.

Reference-contexts: This can be applied to obtain a generating function for the number of k-blockfree n-letter words over A by choosing the set of patterns to be fa k ja 2 Ag, from which we must then compute the parity difference to get the result of Section 10. In <ref> [7] </ref>, Squire studies the existence of Gray codes for n-letter words over A which do not contain a given string. For the case of k-blockfree words, Squire's results do not apply since we are dealing with a set of several forbidden strings. <p> For the case of k-blockfree words, Squire's results do not apply since we are dealing with a set of several forbidden strings. However, the special structure of these strings allows us to construct a simple Gray code. It is interesting to note that there are cases where, according to <ref> [7] </ref>, Gray codes do not exist if the forbidden string is a k for some a 2 A, k &gt; 1, but, according to our results, do exist when the set of forbidden strings is fa k ja 2 Ag.
