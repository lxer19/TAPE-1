Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EA) combine different approaches for solving complex problems based on principles, models, and mechanisms of natural evolution. Typical representatives of such algorithms are Genetic Algorithms(GA) and Evolution Strategies (ES), which are closely related in principle but show different emphasis on the representational and operational level. The basic ideas and concepts for GAs and ESs dates back to the early sixties. Central concepts of these approaches include the replication, recombination, mutation, selection, isolation-migration, and diffusion of individuals within or between populations or subpopulations, respectively. These algorithms do not take into account the development of an individual or organism from the gene level to the mature phenotype level. This development is a multistage decision process influenced by the environment and by interspecific as well as intraspecific competition and cooperation such that usually no inferences can be drawn from phenotype to genotype. The goal of this paper is to introduce a fuzzy representation and fuzzy operations to model the developmental process based on fuzzy decisions. Some first conclusions with respect to optimization will be stated.

Reference-contexts: This process is mainly based on information proliferation and mixing which determines to a certain extend the physical realization corresponding to the information. The basic laws of natural evolution and genetics were discovered by the fundamental work of Charles Darwin <ref> [1] </ref> and Gregor Mendel [6]. The work of Darwin led to highly controversial philosophical discussions whereas the work of Mendel was unknown until the beginnings of the 20th century.

Therefore, we want to recall only the basic notions concerning the genetic representation and the genetic operators. Common to both approaches are the following algorithmic steps which reflect the origin from an evolution point of view.

This was the basis to use models gleaned from natural evolution to adaption, especially optimization, problems. The first ideas and experiments originate from the early sixties.

As we will see later non of these approaches take an individual development into account. <p> The selection is done proportional to the fitness values. It should be emphasized, that the algorithm is principally based on binary decisions because of the binary representation of the genotype. 2.2 Evolution Strategies The multi-membered Evolution Strategy <ref> [8] </ref> can be also described in a fairly simple way: Let us assume that the genotype of an individual g i , i = 1; :::; , of a population P , g i 2 P , is encoded by an array of floating-point values, e.g. g i = 6:43 3:43
