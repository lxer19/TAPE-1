Abstract: For ideal projectile motion, which starts and ends at the same height, maximum range is achieved when the firing angle is 45 o . If air resistance is taken into account, the optimal angle is somewhat less than 45 o and this is often considered obvious. We show here that it is not obvious by considering drag forces with different dependence on projectile speed. In some cases maximum range is achieved for launch angles greater than 45 o . Simple physical arguments are given which help explain results that were found by computing trajectories and ranges. If mechanics is food for thought, then projectile motion provides much of the starch at the beginning of introductory physics courses. One of the more interesting results served is the relationship of the range (horizontal distance traveled) of a projectile and the angle of inclination at its launch. For a fixed initial speed, and for negligible air resistance, the range is a function of that is symmetric about 45 o . The range for 30 o , for example, is the same as the range for 60 o . The optimal angle|i.e., the angle for maximum range|is 45 o . A more difficult question is what is the range if air resistance is taken into account[1]. It is semi-common knowledge that maximum range, when the resistance of still air is taken into account, occurs for angles less than 45 o [2]. But is this answer obvious? An informal survey of our colleagues revealed that the immediate reaction is "yes, it's obvious." This seems to be related to the fact that a lower trajectory reduces the time and distance of flight, therefore minimizing the time and distance over which the drag force due to the air is acting. This point, in fact, is explicitly made in one of the texts[3]. Another introductory textbook[4] clearly treats the issue as obvious, since the question is assigned to the students at the end of the chapter on two-dimensional motion. At this point in the text, Newton's
