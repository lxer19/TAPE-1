Reference-contexts: The TAXI chips can also drive fiber optics; the selection of coax cable was made solely due to cost consideration. Under development is a newer version of the NICs that is based on Cypress HOTLink chips <ref> [1] </ref> and is using fiber optics at rates around 200Mbps. Both the TAXI and the HOTLink chips encode 3/4/5 bits of data to 4/5/6 transmitted bits to make communication more immune to noise.

Reference-contexts: The auxiliary connection, on the other hand, is not buffered, requiring the connected units to receive data at the network speed or provide its own buffering. The NICs are physically connected to one another via differential coax cables that are driven by AMD TAXI chips <ref> [2] </ref> at data rate of 100Mbps. The TAXI chips can also drive fiber optics; the selection of coax cable was made solely due to cost consideration.

Reference-contexts: Miniswitch cards are PC-based. Several application cards, including multimedia cards, cell generator cards, network analyzer cards and others, that can be connected to the NIC were implemented. In the following we describe the various components of the network. The ring is built using buffer insertion ring (BIR) architecture <ref> [3, 7] </ref> with cell removal by the destination [6]. Such a ring does not use tokens for its transmission scheduling and allows spatial reuse, i.e., it can support simultaneous transmissions over different segments of the network. <p> As a result, the total ring throughput can be significantly higher than the capacity of a single link (which limits other ring architectures) . The principle of the BIR operation is as follows <ref> [3] </ref>. On the receiving side of each link, there is an insertion buffer (IB), which can store one ATM cell. A node may start a cell transmission at any time if its IB is empty and if there is no ring traffic on its incoming link.

Reference-contexts: Since ring traffic has priority, it is clear that without an additional access control mechanism heavily loaded nodes can prevent other nodes from accessing the ring a situation known as "starvation". To prevent this problem, mechanisms that guarantee fair access to all nodes have been proposed for BIRs <ref> [5, 6, 4] </ref>. Some of these mechanisms are used in TechLAN together with a bandwidth reservation scheme as required by ATM standards.

Reference-contexts: The interconnection device (miniswitch) is a PC card that can connect three rings as well as its local host. It is built using a shared bus architecture with output buffering <ref> [8] </ref>. This architecture was selected due to its simplicity and because interconnecting a larger number of rings is not anticipated. In addition, the miniswitch supports multicast transmission which is important for multimedia conferencing applications.
