Abstract: FPGAs have been proposed as high-performance alternatives to DSP processors. This paper quantitatively compares FPGA performance against DSP processors and ASICs using actual applications and existing CAD tools and devices. Performance measures were based on actual multiplier performance with FPGAs, DSP processors and ASICs. This study demonstrates that FPGAs can provide an order of magnitude better performance than DSP processors and can in many cases approach or exceed ASIC levels of performance.

Reference-contexts: The CLAy31 bit-serial entries refer to results extrapolated from a signed bit-serial FIR filter design on the CLAy architecture proposed by design engineer Raymond Andraka <ref> [1] </ref>. The CLAy31 parallel entry is for the estimated performance of an 8-bit signed parallel version of the filter on the CLAy31 FPGA. The LD LMU08 and LD LMU18 entries refer to the use of custom multiplier chips from Logic Devices in conjunction with an FPGA to implement the filter.

Reference-contexts: The FPGA has also recently generated interest for use in implementing digital signal processing systems due to its ability to implement custom hardware solutions while still maintaining flexibility through device reprogramming <ref> [2] </ref>. Using the FPGA it is hoped that a significant performance improvement can be obtained over the DSP processor without sacrificing system flexibility.

Reference-contexts: The partial product produced by the high-order nibble of the input word is shifted by 4 bits to the left (a weighting factor of 16) and added to the partial product produced by the lower-order nibble of the input word to produce the 16 bit output <ref> [3] </ref>. Implementing the 8x8 multiplier on a Xilinx FPGA requires a total of 384 bits of storage along with a 12 bit adder. This results in a minimum of 12 CLBs for the data storage and approximately 12 CLBs for the adder for a total of 24 CLBs.

Reference-contexts: The table entry labeled TMS320C5X refers to the popular 16-bit fixed point C5X DSP processors manufactured by Texas Instruments. The benchmark listed is for a C5X with a 35 ns cycle time and a 57 MHz external clock rate <ref> [4] </ref>. The data throughput rate is less than the inverse of the computation time (1.0 s) due to the overhead of executing instructions to set up the filter operation and moving data on and off chip.

The bit-serial multipliers have listed both their clock rate (bit-rate) and their effective multiplication rate (clock rate/2N). 2.3 Multiplier table contents The majority of the multipliers in this study used common architectures such as the Baugh-Wooley two's complement parallel-array multiplier <ref> [5] </ref> and pipelined versions of the bit-serial multiplier [6] shown in Figure 1. In addition, several custom parallel multipliers were built that take advantage of the special features available on the Altera and Xilinx FPGAs.

These are intended to represent near the absolute maximum possible multiplier performance that can be achieved with these current FPGAs.
