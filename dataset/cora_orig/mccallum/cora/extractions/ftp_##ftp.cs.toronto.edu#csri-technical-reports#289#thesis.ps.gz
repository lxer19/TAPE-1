Reference-contexts: It is sufficient for the driver to have a plan that will uniquely identify the referent when it becomes observable even though the driver may not know of the place before getting there <ref> (Appelt, 1985a) </ref>. But how can the system construct referring plans that a driver believes are adequate? By using a simple hard-coded user-model, Davis's system can determine what the user believes is salient. <p> Furthermore, a mutually known object is an object of which the speaker and hearer mutually know some properties <ref> (Appelt, 1985a, p. 1) </ref>. 17 However, a speaker will commonly refer to objects that the hearer has no knowledge of. This type of reference occurs when a speaker wishes the hearer to be able to identify the referent at some later time. <p> Instead of planning a description with respect to the speaker and hearer's mutual knowledge, he tries to plan a description that is useful for the hearer to plan an identification action. <ref> (Appelt, 1985a, p. 2) </ref> This type of reference occurs often in direction-giving dialogues, since Davis says "this description should be so clear that the driver cannot only recognize the place when it comes, but can also be confident in advance that she will be able to recognize the place" (Davis, 1989,

Reference-contexts: Searle considers referring to be a propositional act because it is always part of an illocutionary act. We discuss this view below in section 2.2.2. A further level of abstraction views utterances as surface speech acts <ref> (Appelt, 1985b) </ref>. Surface speech acts are used to realize illocutionary acts and correspond directly to the syntactic structure of an utterance.

Reference-contexts: For example, the instruction Turn left at the third block past the stoplight uttered to a hearer who has no knowledge of the location, carries the speaker's intention that the hearer identify (and be able to identify) the location at the appropriate time <ref> (Appelt, 1985c) </ref>. Appelt says that the speaker's implicit intention that the hearer identify the referent may require the hearer to form and execute a complex plan to make the identification. <p> of agreement, can all be added to make the model more comprehensive. 47 Chapter 4 Referring to Paths and Places 4.1 Introduction From our previous discussion we have seen that the research to date into referring expressions has not dealt with what Appelt calls nonshared concept activation with identification intention <ref> (Appelt, 1985c) </ref>. A speaker uses this action when he wants to refer to an object for which the speaker and hearer do not have mutual (or shared) knowledge with the underlying intention of having the hearer be able to eventually identify the object. <p> This formulation is not always possible|if a person on a bus asks what stop should I get off at, the response one stop before I do is not very useful <ref> (Appelt, 1985c, p. 202) </ref>|so the speaker must endeavour to use an appropriate description. For the second condition to hold, the hearer must believe that the identification plan is good enough to uniquely identify the referent when it becomes visible.

Reference-contexts: These include: the shifting of the focus of attention, reasoning using the rules, constructing and inferring plans, and the acceptance process. This mutual knowledge can be considered part of the social contract that a participant is accountable to upon entering a conversation <ref> (Boden and Zimmerman, 1991) </ref>. 6.2 The Collaborative State To model collaborative discourse, we need a way to account for how discourse goals arise, and how these goals are achieved.

Reference-contexts: But other types of structure are sometimes observed (see Clark and Schaefer (1989)), such as the the consideration of contributions top down instead of bottom up. In Chu's plan evaluator <ref> (Chu, 1993) </ref>, the actions are examined in a top-down fashion so that the most general action that is inappropriate is addressed first. This ordering seems implausible because, if a general contribution is found unacceptable, the cause is probably an unacceptable sub-contribution.

Reference-contexts: This collaborative behaviour can be attributed to several 28 sources, including time pressure (one doesn't want to spend all day giving directions), and the giver's ignorance of the recipient's knowledge (why guess, when one can assume) <ref> (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986) </ref> 1 . Second, in comparison to the work in automated driving directions, in which directions are given dynamically and no complex driver intervention is allowed, directions given in conversation tend to be less specific. <p> We propose that the old proverb of quality over quantity applies here because people usually try to minimize the length of their referring expressions (Reiter, 1990; Reiter and Dale, 1992; Heeman and Hirst, 1992), or because they are forced to make short expressions because of time pressure <ref> (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986) </ref>. To evaluate the adequacy of a referring expression plan, we associate a numeric confidence value with the plan. Even though this value is numeric, it can be interpreted as ranging from low confidence to high confidence. <p> We first look at research into referring expressions, and, second, at research into collaboration. Referring Expressions Heeman and Hirst's model (Heeman and Hirst, 1992) and Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs's model <ref> (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986) </ref> highly influenced our model of reference. The main difference is the type of referring action and its underlying intentions, which results in a different method of evaluating referring expressions and a different method of refashioning them.

Reference-contexts: Functions are provided for adding, testing, and retracting beliefs. Belief revision is not possible. Internally, a belief is encoded as abel (N,Prop) that represents the Nth alternating belief between the system and the user <ref> (Cohen and Levesque, 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: action. (Appelt, 1985a, p. 2) This type of reference occurs often in direction-giving dialogues, since Davis says "this description should be so clear that the driver cannot only recognize the place when it comes, but can also be confident in advance that she will be able to recognize the place" <ref> (Davis, 1989, p. 72) </ref>. <p> Not only are the descriptions of locations important but they are kept relatively short by containing only the most salient features of the location <ref> (Davis, 1989) </ref>. We consider describing a route to be our domain task, even though the conventional view is that a domain task (for a task-oriented dialogue) should not be involved directly with communicative action (Litman and Allen, 1987; Grosz and Sidner, 1990; Lambert and Carberry, 1991; Heeman, 1993).

Reference-contexts: Contextual factors may include the point-of-view, familiarity, and current goals (i.e., to find a location, or to give directions) of a person. Salience can also be influenced by identifiability, visibility, prominence, and even functional importance <ref> (Devlin, 1976) </ref>. Sequences (of elements) are an important, possibly basic, sub-structure in a cognitive map that are especially useful for navigation because they facilitate recognition and mem 13 orization of a route. The majority of elements found in these sequences are paths and nodes, but landmarks are also prevalent.

Reference-contexts: We choose not to use the metric information directly in making descriptions, because people usually find the descriptions inadequate or unclear (Riesbeck, 1980). Topological information is one source of descriptiveness in directions, the where part, but we also need attributive information. Attributive information describes the what part <ref> (Downs and Stea, 1973) </ref>. Kuipers does not consider the attributes of paths and places, which may include landmarks, street signs, street lights, etc. (see Davis (1989)). Attributive information is represented by a set of propositions that an agent believes are true of a path or place.

Reference-contexts: The contribution model accounts for the overall structure of a discourse, but only informally explains the reasons an agent has for using a particular device at a particular time. In other words, they model the linguistic structure but not the intentional structure <ref> (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) </ref>. The content of a contribution is left for another theory to explain. For example, in dialogue (2.1), B's utterance of Duveen? indicates that she has found A's reference to the boy inadequate, and initiates a clarification subdialogue. <p> For the hearer, each entity is new, so she updates her belief about the objects in the current context, or focus of attention <ref> (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) </ref>. 8 We create a new object name for each entity referred to, and add these to the hearer's current context set. The hearer doesn't have any beliefs about the properties of the new objects yet, just the belief that they exist. <p> Since our referring action is made in many different situations over the course of a direction-giving dialogue, we have overlayed the world with a simple model of attention <ref> (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) </ref> that specifies which objects from the world are currently being attended to. 58 To recapitulate the planning process, we describe the use of these three values. The candidate set enables the plan constructor to disambiguate the referent from the other objects in the current situation. <p> In the previous three chapters we discussed how route descriptions, referring expressions for places and paths on the route, and judgements and elaborations of referring expressions are generated and understood within our plan-based model. These processes are similar to what Grosz and Sidner <ref> (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) </ref> call the linguistic structure of a discourse. That is, they account for the actual utterances in a conversation, but not how they are connected.

Reference-contexts: The system is implemented in Prolog. The three central modules are the plan construction module, the plan inference module, and the belief module. We will describe each in turn, paraphrasing from <ref> (Heeman, 1991, pp. 86-92) </ref>. Plan Construction The input to the plan constructor is an effect that the speaker wishes to achieve. The constructor then starts with a set of action schemas that satisfy the intended effect.

Reference-contexts: Understanding Referring Expressions Moving on to the opposite task, the understanding of referring expressions, the obvious approach is to treat the task as constraint satisfaction. The category descriptor gives an initial candidate set, and each component of the expression gives a constraint that serves to reduce the candidate set <ref> (Heeman and Hirst, 1992) </ref>. Ideally this process would leave us with a unique candidate that is the referent. <p> The speaker attempts to achieve this goal by realizing the description as a series of utterances that correspond to surface speech acts that are primitive actions in the plan hierarchy. Our route description action schemas are modelled very closely on Heeman and Hirst's refer action schemas <ref> (Heeman and Hirst, 1992) </ref>. Plan decomposition is used to map the top-level action, through intermediate actions, into surface speech actions. The following is a list of the action schemas that we define along with their decompositions. <p> The assumption is plausible because it leads to a different type of referring action that has a different underlying intention. Appelt's referring action is an attempt to formalize this action, and is distinct from his shared concept activation and Heeman's referring action <ref> (Heeman and Hirst, 1992) </ref>. It is used when the speaker intends to refer to an object that he believes is not known by the hearer. Consider a plan for a referring expression. <p> For a refashioning, this also is reasonable, for if he doesn't find the resulting referring expression adequate, he can still accept it and then proceed to refashion it. <ref> (Heeman and Hirst, 1992, p. 19) </ref> The ramification of this decision is that these moves need not be explicitly accepted and, therefore, can be automatically mutually accepted. <p> We first look at research into referring expressions, and, second, at research into collaboration. Referring Expressions Heeman and Hirst's model <ref> (Heeman and Hirst, 1992) </ref> and Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs's model (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986) highly influenced our model of reference. The main difference is the type of referring action and its underlying intentions, which results in a different method of evaluating referring expressions and a different method of refashioning them.

Reference-contexts: For example, a sequence of turns embedded between or within a contribution to a conversation is a side sequence <ref> (Jefferson, 1972) </ref>. augments the skeletal plan, and the second realizes the augmented plan as language by forming predicates and choosing utterance type. Thus, the text planner deals with both domain-level knowledge, and language-level knowledge. <p> The contribution begun by A, is finally accepted when B gives her answer, but the acceptance phase is a sequence that consists of two other simple contributions that coincide with the turns. This clarification subdialogue is a type of side sequence <ref> (Jefferson, 1972) </ref>, and Clark and Schaefer found them to be pervasive in the corpora. While the authors are not explicitly concerned with collaboration, their model can be the basis for a model of collaborative behaviour.

Reference-contexts: The majority of elements found in these sequences are paths and nodes, but landmarks are also prevalent. Strong elements are more likely to be used when describing spatial information linguistically. Therefore, strong paths, nodes, and landmarks are more likely to be used when giving directions. Kuipers's TOUR model <ref> (Kuipers, 1978) </ref> is a model of commonsense knowledge of a large-scale urban environment. He is concerned with the everyday activities of learning (i.e., the assimilation of new observations into the cognitive map) and problem solving (i.e., the extraction of answers to particular questions of the cognitive map). <p> A route could be considered as a series of paths and places (Frisch et al., 1990; Cole et al., 1991), but we consider it to be a sequence of actions <ref> (Kuipers, 1978) </ref> because a route represents action in the environment. A route description is an alternating sequence of the two possible actions that are taken as one traverses the street network. The two actions are to go to a place, and to make a turn.

The route description is to be remembered and executed at a later date. The direction recipient cannot execute the directions as she hears them.

Reference-contexts: Salience plays a key role in selecting landmarks for describing a location <ref> (Pattabhiraman and Cercone, 1990) </ref>. One can think of many ways to compute the salient properties of a given situation.

Reference-contexts: The collaborative state coordinates the agents' activities by sanctioning the adoption of goals to clarify (expressing judgement, and refashioning) the current plan, and by sanctioning the acceptance of plans that do so. Heeman and Hirst view plans as mental objects as opposed to data structures <ref> (Pollack, 1990) </ref>, which allows an agent to have beliefs and intentions about them. Thus, an agent has a belief about the current plan's validity (whether or not it is mutually believed that the plan refers to a unique referent), and has the intention to make this belief mutually believed.

Reference-contexts: They determine membership in categories such as local area person, stranger to the area, or visitor <ref> (Psathas, 1991, p. 202) </ref>. 11 the direction giver. 2 Participants take conversational turns in which the direction giver describes the next operation in the sequence and then waits for a display of acceptance or understanding by the recipient. <p> How do people do this? In their route descriptions, the descriptions of locations where changes of direction are made are more important than the descriptions of the actions one performs at those locations <ref> (Psathas, 1991) </ref>. Not only are the descriptions of locations important but they are kept relatively short by containing only the most salient features of the location (Davis, 1989). <p> It would be possible to define more s-goto actions, which would take additional parameters (from information in the direction schema). For example, if an additional entity for the path of travel is given, one could utter the following, taken from Psathas's corpus <ref> (Psathas, 1991, p. 196) </ref>: 5 The numeric value of an angle can be converted to a descriptive phrase such as right or sharp right (Davis, 1989; Cole et al., 1991; McDermott, 1980). 39 Stay on 2A until ya get to Lowell Street.

Reference-contexts: Heeman, unlike Appelt and Searle, treats generation as part of the planning process|it is not a primitive action. In other respects, the algorithm is similar to Appelt's, but also draws from Reiter's earlier research on avoiding conversational implicature in generating referring expressions <ref> (Reiter, 1990) </ref>. Understanding Referring Expressions Moving on to the opposite task, the understanding of referring expressions, the obvious approach is to treat the task as constraint satisfaction.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, the same acceptance cycle can be applied in both models, and the discourse actions are very similar. Reiter and Dale's theory <ref> (Reiter and Dale, 1992) </ref> of generating referring expressions involves an algorithm that uniquely specifies a referent while choosing the most preferred attributes of the referent.

Reference-contexts: This framework is a plan-based model of route descriptions, and we begin by discussing interactive direction-giving. Interactive direction-giving presents us with some interesting phenomena to account for. First, in comparison to written directions <ref> (Riesbeck, 1980) </ref>, which tend to be very complete by covering all possible contingencies (including detailed descriptions and error-correction information), conversation allows the directions to be less complete. <p> These requirements are presented in the next three sections, along with examples. The final section of the chapter is a discussion of some meta-issues of the model. 3.2 Representation of Spatial Knowledge Direction-giving in a conversational context requires that the participants employ some spatial reasoning <ref> (Riesbeck, 1980) </ref>. Therefore, in order to give or understand directions, we 30 need an adequate representation of spatial knowledge. We adopt Kuipers's (1978) repre-sentation of the cognitive map, but we use only the features relevant to direction-giving: the topological structure and the route structure. <p> Kuipers's model uses metric information and topological information. We choose not to use the metric information directly in making descriptions, because people usually find the descriptions inadequate or unclear <ref> (Riesbeck, 1980) </ref>. Topological information is one source of descriptiveness in directions, the where part, but we also need attributive information. Attributive information describes the what part (Downs and Stea, 1973).

Reference-contexts: H must decide what type of evidence to present, and generally, the more complicated S's presentation, or the more demanding the current purpose, the stronger the evidence needed. Clark and Schaefer rely on several corpora, including the London-Lund corpus <ref> (Svartvik and Quirk, 1980) </ref>, to determine empirically which types of evidence are expected for which presentations. The acceptance process is inherently recursive, since giving evidence is itself a presentation that needs to be accepted (by presenting further evidence).
