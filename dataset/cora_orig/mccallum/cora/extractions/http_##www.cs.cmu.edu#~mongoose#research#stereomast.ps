Title: Optimal Stereo Mast Configuration for Mobile Robots  
Author: Wesley H. Huang Eric P. Krotkov 
Affiliation: Robotics Institute Carnegie Mellon University  
Abstract: Planning the placement of stereo cameras on a mobile robot is often a balancing act between the quality of stereo data, the reliability of stereo matching, and ensuring that the cameras see enough of the robot's environment for navigation. In this paper, we present a nonlinear programming formulation to determine the optimal parameters for two stereo pairs of cameras and a camera mast for a mobile robot. We have applied this method to the design of a stereo camera mast for Nomad, a prototype rover currently under construction at Carnegie Mellon University, and present the results of designing that mast.

Reference-contexts: The objective function measures the robustness of the viewpoint (i.e. how easily it satisfies the constraints). Some early work in planning camera placement for inspection or light placement for photometric stereo include Cowan and Kovesi <ref> [1] </ref> and Sakane [7]. A survey of camera placement planning appears in Tarabanis et al. [9].

Reference-contexts: This results in a very different set of constraints to guide camera placement. Camera parameters and placement are optimized using a nonlinear program. The constraints presented in this paper are based on work by Krotkov and Hebert <ref> [2] </ref>. 3 Problem Statement We assume that we are given a mobile robot and that the stereo mast will consist of a vertical strut with a horizontal crosspiece upon which the cameras will be mounted. The location of the stereo mast is given; see figure 1.

Reference-contexts: However, hardware constraints strongly discouraged the use of three stereo pairs. The physical parameters and other parameters for Nomad are given in table 1. We tried several different values for the lookahead distance. 6.2 The Nonlinear Program Solver We used GINO <ref> [3] </ref>, a nonlinear programming package, to solve the nonlinear program. GINO uses a version of the generalized reduced gradient algorithm for nonlinear optimization.

The MVP system plans single camera views of static scenes by creating a nonlinear program. The constraints ensure that desired features in a scene are visible, will have sufficient resolution, are all in focus, and are within the field of view of the camera.
