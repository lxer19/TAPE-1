Abstract: Bringsjord's What Robots Can and Can't Be (1992, 1994) reviews many of the arguments and thought experiments current in the foundational literature with the aim of refuting functionalism and thereby the possibility of building persons out of computers. Some of these arguments might work, but only if the functionalism under assault is sufficiently distant from biological functionalism.

Reference-contexts: But it is worth noting that there is less here than meets the eye: for however ineffable the qualitative flavor of experience, this interpretation of the argument in no way supports 5 9. Ned Block's arbitrary realization argument <ref> (Block, 1980) </ref> is perhaps more per-suasive that functionalism is in trouble; at least Bringsjord believes so.

Reference-contexts: No such theory will allow her to pre-experience anything, because no theory supports the pre-experiencing of anything. 6 instantiate a Turing machine in the same way that silicon chips can <ref> (as Pollock, 1989, has noted) </ref>: no matter what forces you bring to bear upon the people to carry out their instructions, they may simply decide not to do so|they may go on a sit-down strike, for example.

Reference-contexts: In order to refute PBP, Bringsjord aims at refuting AI functionalism. Interpreted strictly, it appears that Putnam (1975) has already refuted it <ref> (while also being one of its originators, Putnam 1967) </ref>, since mental states apparently have wide content; for example, such mental states as the belief that water is refreshing refer to things in the world and their truth conditions cannot be exhausted by any accounting in terms of neurostates alone.

Reference-contexts: lever can be defined in functional terms? They obviously do not constitute levers no matter how the snowmen, etc. may be shaped and arranged; but interpreting the claim that the lever is a functional concept as carrying a commitment to arbitrary realizations is what is fundamentally absurd in this story <ref> (for a serious account of functionality, see Wright, 1976) </ref>. 11. In an exactly parallel way we can point out that the Chinese population cannot dualism over physicalism.
