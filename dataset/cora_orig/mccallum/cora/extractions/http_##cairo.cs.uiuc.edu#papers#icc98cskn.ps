Title: On Finding Multi-constrained Paths  
Author: Shigang Chen Klara Nahrstedt 
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  
Abstract: New emerging distributed multimedia applications provide guaranteed end-to-end quality of service (QoS) and have stringent constraints on delay, delay-jitter, cost, etc. The task of QoS routing is to find a route in the network which has sufficient resources to satisfy the constraints. The delay-cost-constrained routing problem is NP-complete. We propose a heuristic algorithm for this problem. The idea is to first reduce the NP-complete problem to a simpler one which can be solved in polynomial time, and then solve the new problem by either an extended Dijkstra's algorithm or an extended Bellman-Ford algorithm. We prove the correctness of our algorithm by showing that a solution for the simpler problem must also be a solution for the original problem. The performance of the algorithm is studied by both theoretical analysis and simulation.

Reference-contexts: A more detailed analysis of the relation between x and the heuristic condition can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. In practice, how large should x be? This question will be discussed in Section 2.4 though experiments. <p> We have studied the heuristic algorithm for MCP with two weight functions and two constraints so far. However, the heuristic algorithm together with EDSP and EBF can be easily generalized for more than two constraints. The generalized algorithms can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 (x + 1)E iterations are the combination result of the outer while loop and the inner for loop. The while loop iterates on u and k, and the for loop iterates on v. 2.3 Multi-Constrained Routing Multi-Constrained routing is an important application of MCP. <p> More detailed explanation and comparison between the Jaffe's algorithms and our heuristic algorithm can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. 4 Conclusion Any multi-constrained routing problem which involves two additive weight functions such as delay and cost is NP-complete. We formalized it as an MCP problem (Definition 1) and proposed a heuristic algorithm with a polynomial time complexity.

Reference-contexts: When Q = ;, the algorithm completes. A more detailed presentation of the original Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford algorithms, which our algorithms are based on, can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. The time complexity of ESDP is (x 2 V 2 ). The maximum size of Q is (x + 1)V . Hence, line 15 can be done within O (xV ).

Reference-contexts: The multi-constrained routing problem is difficult because different constraints can conflict with one another. In particular, the delay-cost-constrained routing, i.e., finding a route between two nodes in the network with both end-to-end delay and end-to-end cost bounds, can be formalized as a multi-constrained path problem (MCP), which is NP-complete <ref> [5, 13] </ref>. We propose a heuristic algorithm for the MCP problem with a polynomial time complexity. <p> An algorithm similar to EBF, in its distributed implementation, has been proposed by Jaffe <ref> [5] </ref>. We will discuss the difference between our algorithm and the Jaffe's algorithm in Section 3. <p> All the above algorithms can not solve MCP whose weight functions are assumed to be additive and independent. The work closest to ours was done by Jaffe <ref> [5] </ref>. Jaffe proposed a distributed algorithm solving MCP with a time complexity of O (V 5 b log V b), 5 where b is the largest weight of all edges in the network. <p> The complexity is pseudo-polynomial because the run time is polynomial in b, the largest number in the input. See [4] for the definition of the pseudo-polynomial time complexity. Heuristic algorithms are also proposed in <ref> [5] </ref> to approximate the MCP problem. Instead of finding a multi-constrained path, the algorithms find a path with minimized w 1 (p) + d w 2 (p). 6 However, minimizing w 1 (p) + d w 2 (p) may not always lead to a solution of MCP. <p> The algorithm first reduces the problem MCP (G, s, t, 5 The Jaffe's algorithm finds a solution for every pair of nodes in the network whereas our heuristic algorithm does that for a single pair. 6 The paper <ref> [5] </ref> used different terminologies and notations from ours. w 1 (p) + d w 2 (p) was written as L (p) + d W (p), where L and W correspond to w 1 and w 2 , respectively. w 1 , w 2 , c 1 , c 2 ) to
