Abstract: Location management is one of the most important issues in mobile computing. Location management consists of location updates, searches and search-updates. An update occurs when a mobile host changes location. A search occurs when a host wants to communicate with a mobile host whose location is unknown to the requesting host. A search-update occurs after a successful search, when the location information corresponding to the searched host is updated at some hosts. Various strategies can be designed for search, update and search-update. Static location management uses one fixed combination of search, update and search-update strategies. Simulations were carried out to evaluate the performance of different static location management strategies for various call-mobility patterns. It was noticed that performing search-updates significantly reduced the search costs without significantly increasing the cost of updates (upon moves and searches). In order to obtain good performance using static location management, the system designer should a priori have a fair idea of the call-mobility pattern of the users. Having this information, the system designer can select the combination which performs best for the given call-mobility pattern. The host behavior (call frequency, mobility) is not always available to the system designer. Thus, there is a need for adaptive location management. In this paper we present a scheme for adaptive location management. The basic assumption behind adaptive location management is that the past history of the system will reflect the behavior in the future. The adaptive scheme dynamically estimates the future host behavior with the help of the past call-mobility patterns. Results indicate that the adaptive scheme performs better than the static scheme for a wide range of call-mobility patterns. fl Preliminary version appears in the Proceedings of Third IEEE Conference on Parallel and Distributed Information Systems, September, 1994.

Reference-contexts: As shown in There are two distinct sets of entities, namely mobile hosts and fixed hosts. A host that can move while retaining its network connection is called a mobile host (mh) <ref> [1] </ref>. The static network comprises of the fixed hosts and the communication links between them. Some of the fixed hosts, called mobile support stations (MSS) 1 are augmented with a wireless interface, and, they provide a gateway for communication between the wireless network and the static network. <p> This region is referred to as a mobile support station's cell. The geographical area covered by a cell is a function of the medium used for wireless communication. Currently, the average size of a cell is of the order of 1-2 miles in diameter <ref> [1] </ref>. In future, the cells are expected to be very small (less than 10 meters in diameter) covering the interior of a building [4]. A mobile host communicates with one mobile support station (MSS) at any given time.

Reference-contexts: Ioannidis et. al. proposed IP-based protocols for providing continuous networks access for mobile computers using caching and forwarding technique [9]. However, these protocols were primarily proposed for a campus environment with mobile computers. The idea of location management with home location servers has been earlier proposed in the literature <ref> [2, 11, 12] </ref>. Caching techniques have been proposed for Personal Communication Services (PCS) [12]. Here, an auxiliary strategy called per-user caching is proposed to locate users who move from place to place while using PCS. This strategy augments the basic location strategy which uses home location servers (H LS). <p> This strategy augments the basic location strategy which uses home location servers (H LS). Badrinath et. al. examined strategies that reduce search costs and control the volume of location updates by employing user profiles <ref> [2] </ref>. Their architecture consists of a hierarchy of location servers which are connected to each other and to the base stations (or mobile support stations) by a static network. Each user is assumed to be registered under one of the location servers called the home location server (H LS).

Reference-contexts: Fowler proposed the use of forwarding pointers to keep track of these objects. As explained later, our paper borrows the idea of manipulating forwarding pointers upon a successful search. Awerbuch et. al. proposed a theoretical model for online tracking of mobile hosts <ref> [3] </ref>. The architecture is assumed to be a hierarchy of "m-regional matching directories". Each node u in the data-structure maintains sets read (u) and write (u).

Reference-contexts: Currently, the average size of a cell is of the order of 1-2 miles in diameter [1]. In future, the cells are expected to be very small (less than 10 meters in diameter) covering the interior of a building <ref> [4] </ref>. A mobile host communicates with one mobile support station (MSS) at any given time. MSS is responsible for forwarding data between the mobile host (mh) and the static network. Due to mobility, mh may cross the boundary between two cells while being active. <p> Due to mobility, mh may cross the boundary between two cells while being active. Thus, the task of forwarding data between the static network and the mobile host must be transferred to the new cell's mobile support station. This process, known as handoff, is transparent to the mobile user <ref> [4] </ref>. 1 Mobile support stations are sometimes called base stations. 4 Static Location Management A location management strategy will be a combination of a search strategy, an update strategy, and a search-update strategy. Figure 2 illustrates the space of location management strategies discussed in this paper.

Reference-contexts: typical personal communications network, it was determined that the memory required at the first level (the parents of the leaf level nodes) location servers for P I equal to 1 hour, was about 340 Kbytes when no search updates were used, and, about 840 Kbytes when jump updates were used <ref> [5] </ref>. Let the current time be curr time. If f p time 6= N U LL, and curr time f p time P I , then the entry for the host is purged from the M SS 4 . <p> Other cost metrics are also possible. For instance, in our further work we use total cost (sum of search cost, update cost and search-update cost) per move as a cost metric <ref> [5] </ref>. 5.3 Results Simulations were performed to analyze the performance of the various location management strategies. Results were obtained for the two type of environments, Type (i) and (ii). The values of C and M were both varied from 1 to 15 units of time. <p> Although, forwarding pointers reduces network load during updates, they may increase search cost due to long chain lengths. We propose heuristics to limit the number of forwarding pointers traversed during a search. We build analytical models to compare the performance of the proposed approach with the IS-41 scheme <ref> [5] </ref>. Apart from location management, we are also working on developing routing protocols in ad-hoc wireless local area networks [6], and recovery protocols for mobile wireless networks [7].

Reference-contexts: Section 6 presents the adaptive location management scheme and conclusions and further work are presented in Section 7. 2 Review of Related Literature Numerous location strategies have been proposed in the recent years. One of the earlier works which dealt with object tracking was done in 1986 by Fowler <ref> [15] </ref>. Fowler deals with techniques to efficiently use forwarding addresses for finding decentralized objects. The environment is an object-oriented computer system, where the objects are allowed to move between processes. If a process wants to perform an operation on an object, it has to first locate it. <p> Set search cell = f p dest. Go to step 1. Else Forward the query to the next higher level location server on the path to the root. Go to Step 2. 4.6 Search-Update Protocols The idea of manipulating forwarding pointers upon a successful search was earlier suggested in <ref> [15] </ref>. It was used to track objects in a decentralized object oriented computer system. Location management becomes more efficient if the location updates also take place after a successful search. For example, suppose there is a host h that frequently calls h 0 . <p> Suppose the location information of h2 is available only at the location servers f6,3,1g. Using the search protocol described previously, the search path will be 8 ! 4 ! 2 ! 1 ! 12 (as shown in Figure 6). During a jump update <ref> [15] </ref> following the search, the location information at 8 is updated. Thus, 8 jumps from wherever it is in the forwarding path to having the current location information (as shown in Figure 6). The update cost is 1. <p> In Figure 4, let host h1 call host h2. Suppose the location information of h2 is available only at the location servers f6,3,1g. As shown in Figure 6, the search path will be 8 ! 4 ! 2 ! 1 ! 12. During a path compression update <ref> [15] </ref> following the search, location updates take place at location servers f4,2,1g, and M SS 8. Thus, all the nodes in the search path have the current location information (as shown in Figure 6).

Reference-contexts: This scheme was mainly aimed for local networks such as in building premises. Wu et. al. dealt with the idea of caching location data at the Internet Access Point (I AP ) <ref> [16] </ref>. Here, the I AP will maintain location data of some of the hosts. This becomes useful when optimal routing decisions are to be taken.

The "physical" addresses of a mobile host might change, but its home address remains the same, irrespective of the host's location <ref> [17, 18] </ref>. Each LS maintains an address mapping table that maps the home address to the physical address of the mobile hosts residing in the subtree beneath it. Thus, the problem of location management basically focuses on the management of the address mapping table.
