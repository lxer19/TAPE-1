Abstract: Let T 2 be the graph obtained from the Petersen graph by first deleting a vertex and then contracting an edge incident to a vertex of degree two. We give a simple characterization of the graphs that contain no minor isomorphic to T 2 . This characterization is used to show that if every planar r-graph is r-edge colourable, then every r-graph with no minor isomorphic to T 2 is r-edge colourable.

Reference-contexts: Conjecture 1.6 Every T 3 -free graph is d 0 (G)e-edge colourable. We mention that Conjectures 1.5 and 1.6 also deal with the structure of the matching polyhedron of the corresponding graphs.

Reference-contexts: Sometimes 0 (G) is called the fractional chromatic index of G. It follows from the work of Edmonds <ref> [2] </ref> that 0 (G) = r when G is an r-graph and so Theorem 1.1 would imply that for r-regular graphs, fractional r-edge colourability implies that G is r-edge colourable. <p> Conjecture 1.6 Every T 3 -free graph is d 0 (G)e-edge colourable.

Reference-contexts: The smallest example of a graph not being d 0 (G)e-edge colourable is the Petersen graph minus a vertex, denoted by T 3 . This can also be 2 described as K 3;3 with the edges of a perfect matching subdivided once. It was shown in <ref> [4] </ref>, that every T 3 -free graph G with 0 (G) = 3 is 3-edge colourable if Conjecture 1.4 holds (and that any T 3 3-graph is 3-edge colourable). <p> It turns out that degree three replications can be used in this way for the edge-colouring problems on r-graphs (see Theorem 4.1). Such a decomposition for T 3 -free 3-graphs is simple and is given in <ref> [4] </ref>. For general graphs, however, finding such colouring-preserving operations seems to be a difficult problem; it was only recently shown, for example, how to reduce edge-colouring problems (i.e., with a view to resolving Conjecture 1.5) along vertex 2-cuts [6]. We close with few remarks about minors and notation.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, write G = [F; I; M ], where F has as few vertices as possible. We shall show that F is a planar graph. Suppose this is not true. Then by Kuratowski's Theorem <ref> [5] </ref>, F contains a subdi-vsion of a graph H which is isomorphic to K 5 or K 3;3 . Suppose first that H ~ = K 5 . Since each v 2 V (H) has degree four in H, v 62 I.

Reference-contexts: So let y 2 V (G)n (V (H) [ M ). G is 3-connected and thus, by the fan lemma (a well-known corollary of Menger's Theorem <ref> [7] </ref>), there are internally disjoint paths P yy i , 1 i 3, from y to distinct vertices of V (H). It can be seen that each P yy i may be chosen so as to not contain any pair of mate vertices.

Reference-contexts: Then Conjecture 1.1 is Tait's [12] equivalent formulation of the four colour problem and Conjecture 1.2 is Tutte's [14] generalization of the same problem. Now to obtain Conjectures 1.1 and 1.2 in their general form we need only introduce the following conjecture of Seymour <ref> [9] </ref>: when r 4, every r-graph G has a matching M such that G M is an (r 1)-graph. This together with Conjecture 1.2 would imply the following conjecture attributed by Goddyn to Lovasz. Conjecture 1.3 The perfect matchings of a P 10 -free graph form a Hilbert basis.

Reference-contexts: There is a more general (than 1.1) conjecture of Seymour <ref> [10] </ref> that also contains the four colour problem as a special case.

Reference-contexts: This conjecture appears to require substantially more than the veracity of the four colour conjecture. It was only recently shown, for instance, that the result holds for series-parallel graphs (see <ref> [11] </ref>). The smallest example of a graph not being d 0 (G)e-edge colourable is the Petersen graph minus a vertex, denoted by T 3 . This can also be 2 described as K 3;3 with the edges of a perfect matching subdivided once.

Reference-contexts: Conjecture 1.2 Every r-graph with no Petersen graph (see Figure 1) as a minor is r-edge colourable. Historically, Conjectures 1.1 and 1.2 date back to the famous four colour problem. Consider the special case when r = 3. Then Conjecture 1.1 is Tait's <ref> [12] </ref> equivalent formulation of the four colour problem and Conjecture 1.2 is Tutte's [14] generalization of the same problem.

Reference-contexts: Thus we may assume that G has no such cut. It suffices now to show that that G has a matching M such that G M is an (r 1)-graph. By Tutte's Theorem <ref> [13] </ref>, G has a perfect matching M . We claim that G M is an (r 1)-graph.
