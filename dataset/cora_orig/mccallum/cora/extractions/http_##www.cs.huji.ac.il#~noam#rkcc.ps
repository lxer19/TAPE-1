Abstract: This paper concerns the open problem of Lovasz and Saks regarding the relationship between the communication complexity of a boolean function and the rank of the associated matrix. We first give an example exhibiting the largest gap known. We then prove two related theorems.

Reference-contexts: A tempting conjecture (see [LS88]) is Conjecture 1 For every matrix M , c (M ) = (log rk (M )) O (1) Lovasz and Saks [LS89] also show that this conjecture is strongly related to a conjecture of van Nuffelen [Nu76] and Fajtlowicz <ref> [Fa87] </ref> regarding the connection between the chromatic number of a graph and the rank of its adjacency matrix. The best separation known so far gives an infinite family of matrices for which c (M ) log rk (M ) log log log rk (M) [RS93].

Reference-contexts: The construction is based on boolean functions with high "sensitivity" and low degree. Such a function was constructed in [NS92]. The lower bound for the communication complexity relies on the known lower bounds for randomized communication complexity of "disjointness" <ref> [KS87, Raz90] </ref>. Recently Kushilevitz [Ku94] has somewhat improved the construction of [NS92] and has thus reduced the value of ff to log 6 3 = 0:61:::. The main lemma of [NS92] shows however that this technique cannot reduce the value of ff to below 1=2.

If the sets intersect at exactly 1 point then they must reject. If the size of the intersection is greater than 1 then the players are allowed to either accept or reject. 1 Recently, <ref> [Ku94] </ref> has improved upon this construction by exhibiting a function E 0 on 6 variables which is fully sensitive at ~ 0 and with degree only 3.

Reference-contexts: As rank arguments are the main source of deterministic communication complexity lower bounds, and the rank function has many useful properties, it would make life nicer if the lower bound was rather tight. A tempting conjecture (see <ref> [LS88] </ref>) is Conjecture 1 For every matrix M , c (M ) = (log rk (M )) O (1) Lovasz and Saks [LS89] also show that this conjecture is strongly related to a conjecture of van Nuffelen [Nu76] and Fajtlowicz [Fa87] regarding the connection between the chromatic number of a graph

It is easy to check that E is fully sensitive at ~ 0.

The same is true for non-deterministic and for randomized protocols. Now notice that if f is fully sensitive at ~ 0 then any protocol for M f directly solves U DISJ.

Reference-contexts: Note that Theorem 3 implies Conjecture 3. Moreover, it supplies the first clue that low rank has something to do with low communication complexity, though in a very weak sense. The communication model we have in mind is distributional communication complexity, where the inputs are chosen at random <ref> [Y83] </ref>. For this model, low rank guarantees a cheap protocol with a nontrivial advantage over guessing the function value.
