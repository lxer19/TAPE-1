Abstract: This is an attempt to very briefly cover essential aspects of Quasi-Bayesian theory and its cousins, lower previsions, lower probability, lower envelopes Choquet capacities, etc. I concentrate on Quasi-Bayesian theory as exposed and axiomatized by Giron and Rios [5], as the others can be derived from it, or at least can be explained from it. Also, the framework proposed by Giron and Rios is very close in spirit to the Bayesian framework and therefore requires little effort from a Bayesian [2, 3, 10]. Quasi-Bayesian theory is a normative theory of decision making. So its purpose is to explain how an agent should make decisions. Making a decision is deciding which possible act to follow. It is normative because it only offers guidelines; it is not supposed to be a description of how real agents work. But it offers some sensible guidelines that have been discussed and used for ages. Some use the term utility for the reverse of loss; i.e., loss with a minus sign. I will loss as the basic concept, because most of the literature in Statistics and Electrical Engineering use it this way. But loss and utility are essentially the same thing.

Reference-contexts: Also, Quasi-Bayesians use a credal set to investigate how sensitive decisions are with respect to an extended range of models; that's mostly what is done in Robust Bayesian Statistics <ref> [1, 6] </ref>. Others simply point out that even if experts give sharp numbers, real agents are more faithfully represented by a theory that does not require that a single number be produced for every possible act, specially if a group of agents is to be considered [9].

Reference-contexts: But there are many other proposed theories, more or less related to Bayesian theory, that also use sets or intervals of probabilities to represent an agent's preferences or beliefs. Here are some you may have heard: Lower Probabilities <ref> [4] </ref>, Choquet Capacities, Monotone Capacities, 2-monotone Capacities, Infinitely monotone Capacities (belief functions), Lower Envelopes [6], Lower Expectations, Lower Previsions [11]. The last five names are essentially identical to "Convex Sets of Probabilities of Some Sort".

Reference-contexts: In Quasi-Bayesian theory you say: "I intend to bet in bananas at odds that go from 1:5 up to 3:5 (20% to 60%)". The convex set of probability distributions is called the credal set <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. It conveys the beliefs of the agent about the possible states of the world. So you see that the theory is strongly subjectivist, just like Bayesian theory.

Reference-contexts: Others simply point out that even if experts give sharp numbers, real agents are more faithfully represented by a theory that does not require that a single number be produced for every possible act, specially if a group of agents is to be considered <ref> [9] </ref>. And others take this argument to mean that, for an agent with finite computational resources, it may be advantageous to manipulate sets of distributions as a cruder (abstracted) model of a particular decision problem. As the name indicates, Quasi-Bayesian theory is closely related to Bayesian theory.

Reference-contexts: Note that Bayesian theory is the particular case of a credal set with a single element. Quasi-Bayesians point out that real experts are more likely to specify probability values in intervals: "Well, I guess the probability of rain is between 20% and 25%...", and so on <ref> [11] </ref>.
