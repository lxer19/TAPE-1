Abstract: Minimally invasive surgical techniques, in particular endoscopy and laparoscopy, have many advantages over traditional surgery, most notably rapid patient recovery. Limitations of current instrumentation, however, can make minimally invasive techniques awkward for the surgeon. In this paper, we present prototypes for improved endoscopic and laparoscopic instruments and human interfaces which will allow the surgeon greater dexterity and control.

Reference-contexts: Since suturing is one of the more difficult procedures to do laparo-scopically ([11], pp. 23-25; [15], p. 98), we used the thumb-two finger grasp a surgeon uses with a hand-held surgical needle (the thumb on one side and the index and middle fingers on the other; <ref> [1] </ref>, pp. 58-60) as one of our hand poses. We developed a simple calibration procedure to take sensor readings from four right-handed subjects' hands in nine standard poses. Each subject also underwent tests designed to assess the consistency and relevance of the calibration measurements.

Reference-contexts: We further envision a teleoperative surgical workstation which would combine the improved interface and tools for laparoscopy to enhance the surgeon's control of the operation. 2 Endoscopic Manipulators Discussion of endoscopic techniques can be found in Baillie <ref> [2] </ref>, Siegel [17], and Silverstein and Tytgat [18]. An endoscope is a flexible tube 70-180 cm long, typically 11 mm in diameter. Remote operations in the colon or in the esophagus are performed by inserting various tools through a 2.8 mm channel in the endoscope to the operative site.

Reference-contexts: For suturing, dissection, and related tasks, a device must also be able to generate a force of approximately 10 Newtons in any direction. A peak velocity of 20 cm/sec and a frequency response of at least 10-20 Hz would be desirable (see <ref> [3] </ref>). We have proceeded under the assumption that significant advances will call for new actuator technology, both to implement a given design, and to make it manufacturable. We thus directed our efforts toward integrated fabrication approaches reminiscent of the IC manufacturing process. <p> This system allows tactile features to be located with 100 accuracy. 4 Human Interface There are many issues to consider in designing a human interface for a teleoperative task; discussions can be found in Brooks <ref> [3] </ref>, Brooks and Bejczy [4], Burdea and Zhuang [5], Fischer, Daniel, and Siva [10], McAffee and Fiorini [13], and Sheridan [16]. For the endo-platform device, a simple, nondextrous master such as a joystick is sufficient for natural control. The laparoscopic manipulator, however, requires a more complex, dextrous human interface.

Reference-contexts: One potential application of this device, nonetheless, is in palpation of the lung for detection of tumors. Such an application would require some form of tactile feedback, for example, using a strain-sensor array on the end-effector surface (see <ref> [6] </ref>). In addition, this rubber manipulator could replace roticulator devices, which are used to route ligatures for retraction of the esophagus (pulling it up and away from the chest wall). Such tasks call for a small, flexible device which need not generate exceptional force. <p> We hope to implement tactile feedback using strain sensor arrays on the end-effector coupled to stimulator arrays worn on the surgeon's fingertips. A "teletaction" system has recently been demonstrated <ref> [6] </ref> and appropriate tactile sensors spanning the 1 mm to 3 cm size range are being developed in our laboratory. These devices have a resolution of 64 to 128 elements and employ capacitive sensing [9], [12].

Reference-contexts: A more detailed discussion of this experiment can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. For the stylized movements tested, the calibration values appear to be fairly consistent with the values recorded during movement for both the index finger and the wrist. The thumb traces were much more variable and did not correspond well with the thumb calibration values.

Reference-contexts: Other limitations of this design included the friction and backlash introduced by the joints, the friction due to routing tendons through the hand, and the kinematic problems inherent in tendon-driven serial links <ref> [8] </ref>, as well as potential manufacturing problems. In our final design, we chose to use hydraulic actuation, because this technology combines high force and stiff output in a small actuator.

Reference-contexts: Each finger was an elongated balloon, ribbed to allow expansion only on the dorsal surface and in a longitudinal direction (see Figure 2). Inflating the finger with air caused it to curl. This design was inspired by Suzumori's flexible micro-actuator <ref> [19] </ref>. The fingers were built up in layers of molded silicone rubber. The molds were machined in hard wax using a table-top CNC (computer numerically controlled) mill. With this technique, we could attain 50 accuracy and 500 feature size.

Reference-contexts: The three tendons are attached to pulleys on DC motors with optical position encoders. The endo-platform is capable of 90 degree bends. Currently, only open-loop control has been implemented. The kinematics and dynamics of the device and a simulation of a closed-loop controller are described in detail in <ref> [20] </ref>. We are using 0.1 mm Kevlar tendons since they have a higher tensile strength (37 Newtons) and are more durable than metal tendons. At the tensile strength of the Kevlar tendons, a 13 Newton force is produced at the tool tip with the tool at a 45 degree angle. <p> Here we have presented a design to provide fine motion at the tip of the endoscope; other designs for providing rotation about the tool axis (currently only transmitted passively down the tool, which is not torsionally stiff) and improving the ability to snare polyps can be found in <ref> [20] </ref>. Future work will focus on implementing closed-loop control, incorporating a user interface, and fine-tuning the design so that it can eventually be used in surgical experiments. 3 Laparoscopic Manipulators Discussion of laparoscopic techniques can be found in Graber, et al.
