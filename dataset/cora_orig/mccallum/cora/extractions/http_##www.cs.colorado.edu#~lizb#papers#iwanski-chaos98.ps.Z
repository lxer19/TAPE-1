Abstract: A recurrence plot is a visualization tool for analyzing experimental data. These plots often reveal correlations in the data that are not easily detected in the original time series. Existing recurrence plot analysis techniques, which are primarily application-oriented and completely quantitative, require that the time-series data first be embedded in a high-dimensional space, where the embedding dimension d E is dictated by the dimension d of the data set, with d E 2d + 1. One such set of recurrence plot analysis tools, Recurrence Quantification Analysis, is particularly useful in finding locations in the data where the underlying dynamics change. We have found that the same results can be obtained with no embedding. The work presented in this paper represents the beginning of an attempt to improve upon recurrence plot analysis in a way that incorporates and exploits their rich structural characteristics.

Reference-contexts: The process of constructing a correct embedding is the subject of a large body of literature and numerous heuristic algorithms and arguments; Abarbanel's recent text <ref> [1] </ref> gives a good summary of this extremely active field. The basic problem is 5 embedding dimensions 1-4, respectively, and all four plots have identical threshold corridors and time delay values.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction First introduced in a 1987 paper by Eckmann, Kamphorst, and Ruelle <ref> [3] </ref>, the recurrence plot (rp) is an analysis tool for experimental time-series data. An rp is a two-dimensional representation of a single trajectory. <p> Our study of recurrence plots has been motivated by the desire to give meaning to the fascinating structures that they exhibit. Previous work in this area is primarily 1 Point (9435,117) will be shaded similarly. As originally conceived, however, rps are not necessarily symmetric <ref> [3] </ref>. 2 Recall that the shading of the point (w; v) on this plot reflects the distance between sin w and sin v; if w v = =2, for example, that distance is large. 3 (b) a more-complicated signal from the Lorenz system and the corresponding recurrence plots. <p> The fifth and final RQA statistic is 1=line max , where line max is the longest line found during the computation of det. Eckmann et al. claim that line lengths on rps are directly related to the inverse of the largest positive Lyapunov exponent <ref> [3] </ref>. Short line max values are therefore indicative of chaotic behavior.

Reference-contexts: Webber and Zbilut [14], for instance, used recurrence plot analysis to discern between "quiet" and "active" breathing in laboratory rats, and Kaluzny and Tarnecki <ref> [4] </ref> used rps to study neuronal spike trains in cats. rps have been used in mathematical problems primarily to identify transition points in non-stationary data sets.

Reference-contexts: This percentage is precisely what is used to compute the correlation dimension of a data set | Kaplan and Glass <ref> [5] </ref>, for instance, define correlation dimension as the slope of the linear region in the S-shaped % recurrence vs. corridor width plot. RQA, however, stops short of extending the analysis beyond the simple calculation of the percentage of dark points on the plot.

Reference-contexts: In all four of the studies mentioned in the related work paragraph above, for example, the data were first embedded in R d E for some d E &gt; 1, using the familiar method of delay coordinates <ref> [8] </ref>. Contrary to current time-series analysis arcana, however, our evidence suggests that d E need only be equal to one if the data are to be analyzed with RQA. <p> E and t is critical to this type of phase-space reconstruction and must therefore be done wisely; only "correct" values of these two parameters yield embeddings that are guaranteed | by the Takens Theorem [12] and subsequent work by Packard, Crutchfield, Farmer and Shaw [7] and Sauer, Yorke and Casdagli <ref> [8] </ref> | to be topologically equivalent to the original (unobserved) phase-space dynamics.

Reference-contexts: This generally means that points are recurrent only if they are close in time. EN T = k=1 where N is the number of bins and P k is the percentage of all lines that fall into bin k. According to Shannon's information theory <ref> [9] </ref>, predictability decreases with increasing entropy, so one would expect low values of ent for trps of chaotic data sets, for example. The fourth RQA statistic, termed trend, measures how quickly a trp "pales" away from the main diagonal.

Reference-contexts: Trulla, Giuliani, Zbilut, and Webber <ref> [13] </ref>, for instance, analyzed the dynamics of the logistic equation, varying the driving parameter smoothly and leading the time series between chaotic and periodic regimes. They concluded that rp analysis compares favorably to classical statistical approaches as a means for analyzing chaotic data, particularly in its ability to detect bifurcations. <p> In this paper, we present a suite of numerical calculations on simulated and experimental data sets that explore this question. Specifically, we demonstrate that the Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) of <ref> [13] </ref> appears not to depend on the embedding dimension. Analytic justification of this result is a current focus of our effort and the topic of a forthcoming paper. This result suggests that recurrence plots are more powerful than was previously believed. <p> Our procedure, which uses corridor boundary values that isolate "interesting" structures in the utrp, is also somewhat unsatisfying, and we are working on developing a better formalization. In the meantime, it is an adequate preliminary approach; for instance, it allowed us to reproduce the results in <ref> [13] </ref>, even though that paper did not specify a threshold corridor. Moreover, our procedure allows us to isolate and examine interesting structures across the range of recurrence distances | unlike most existing trp approaches, which specify threshold corridors of the form [0; r]. <p> Trulla, Guiliani, Zbilut, and Webber <ref> [13] </ref> have devised a set of quantifying analyses, collectively called Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA), to address this problem. The remainder of this section covers the RQA procedure in detail. We view these techniques as the best-formulated and most-general approach to rp analysis that has been developed to date. <p> We then investigate how changes in embedding dimension affect the quantitative rp features, as captured by three of the five RQA statistics. Finally, we duplicate the analysis of <ref> [13] </ref> | wherein RQA was used to detect dynamical variations in a nonstationary time series derived from the logistic map | and we extend that analysis to the Lorenz system. <p> Trulla, Giuliani, Zbilut, and Webber <ref> [13] </ref>, for instance, used RQA to recognize bifurcations in the dynamics of the logistic equation. In this section, we duplicate these results without embedding the data 7 . <p> In order to show that RQA is an effective method for detecting bifurcations, Trulla, Giuliani, Zbilut, and Webber <ref> [13] </ref> applied their analyses to a somewhat different logistic map time series | one in which the transient behavior was not allowed to die out. They began with dynamic parameter ff = 2:8 and initial condition x 0 = 0:6. <p> There are some minor shape differences in the plots, but the bifurcation points are equally distinguishable in all four embeddings. This implies that the results and claims in <ref> [13] </ref> may not really require embedding the data. The logistic map is, of course, fundamentally one-dimensional, so one might naturally expect any data analysis results to be independent of d E 9 . <p> The results presented here support this hypothesis through diverse examples in several dynamical systems. In particular, we have demonstrated that the Recurrence Quantification Analysis of Trulla, Giuliani, Zbilut, and Webber <ref> [13] </ref>, a statistical, quantitative rp analysis method, does not require time-series embedding. That is, for the purpose of finding bifurcation points in data sets, d E = 1 is adequate for computation of the RQA statistics.
