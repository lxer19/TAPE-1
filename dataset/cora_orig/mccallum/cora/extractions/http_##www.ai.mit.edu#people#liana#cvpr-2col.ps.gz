Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of recognizing an object from a novel viewpoint, given a single "model" view of that object. As is common in model-based recognition, objects and images are represented as sets of feature points. We present an efficient algorithm for determining whether two sets of image points (in the plane) could be projections of a common object (a three-dimensional point set). The method relies on the fact that two sets of points in the plane are orthographic projections of the same three-dimensional point set exactly when they have a common projection onto a line. This is a form of the well-known epipolar constraint used in stereopsis. Our algorithm can be used to recognize an object by comparing a stored two-dimensional view of the object against an unknown view, without requiring the correspondence between points in the views to be known a priori. We provide some examples illustrating the approach.

Reference-contexts: Another class of approaches to recognition are based on matching views or images of objects, such approaches include subspace methods [12], the linear combinations approach [16], and the generalization of linear combinations to reprojection of novel views from two or more stored views <ref> [4, 14] </ref>. In these latter approaches, an object is represented by a set of two-dimensional views, and new views are generated from combinations of the stored views. In practice, the major limitation of such methods is the difficulty of accurately determining the correspondence between features in the different views. <p> In practice, the major limitation of such methods is the difficulty of accurately determining the correspondence between features in the different views.

Reference-contexts: In stereopsis it is assumed that the two views are of a common scene (or 3D point set) and the goal is to recover the geometry. The above lemma was shown in <ref> [7] </ref>. Lemma 1 provides a condition for P and Q to be projections of the same three-dimensional point set, which depends only on the relation between the two-dimensional sets P and Q and not on their relation to S. <p> There will always be matching subsets of at least size two, because there are always orientations 1 and 2 that make two points project to the same length segment (in general, four points are sufficient to ensure that there will be zero or one solutions for 1 and 2 <ref> [7] </ref>). We thus require the maximal sized subset to be at least four points in order to report a match (in practice, with sensory uncertainty it should be even larger).

Reference-contexts: and, when unequal, the difference seems to be small enough that our results are unaffected. (This is because the ranges at the fine levels of the grid are quite small, and thus the error is negligible.) Also, because it is easy to implement, we use the bipartite matcher described in <ref> [13] </ref>, which runs in O (min (m; n)e) time, where e is the number of edges in the graph, instead of time O ((m + n) 2:5 ).
