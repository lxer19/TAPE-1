Abstract: We show that the well-known Lyapunov sufficient condition for "input-to-state stability" is also necessary, settling positively an open question raised by several authors during the past few years. Additional characterizations of the ISS property, including one in terms of nonlinear stability margins, are also provided.

Reference-contexts: In the late 1980s, one of the coauthors introduced a particular precise definition of input/state stability, and established a few basic results; see for instance [4], [6], and [5]. These results then were applied in different areas, including observer design and new small-gain theorems; see for instance [7], [8], <ref> [1] </ref>, and [3].

This motivates checking the ISS property by investigating ISS-Lyapunov functions for the given system. <p> A particular case of the above setup is as follows. Fix any smooth function '. Then, for any d (t) 2 M D = the set of all measurable functions from IR to D = <ref> [1; 1] </ref> m , the function k (t; ~) = d (t)'(~) is an admissible feedback law. We view the system _x (t) = f (x (t); d (t)'(x (t))) = g (x (t); d (t)) (20) as a "system with disturbances d (t)".

Reference-contexts: In this work, we show that it is also necessary for a input/state stable system to admit an ISS-Lyapunov function. The proof is based on a reduction to a question about systems with disturbances and relies on a new Converse Lyapunov Theorem for such systems proved in <ref> [2] </ref>. In the process of proving the main result, a number of other natural characterizations became available, including one in terms of nonlinear stability margins. <p> Also, without loss of generality, one can assume that ff 3 2 K 1 (cf. <ref> [2] </ref>, Remark 4.1). Finally, observe that Equation (4) states that the derivative _ V along trajectories is negative definite for large enough x, given any control magnitude. <p> Note that Property 2 also implies that the system is forward complete, that is, T ~;u = 1 for all ~ 2 IR n and all u. By Proposition 5.1 in <ref> [2] </ref>, there is an L &gt; 0 such that jx (t; ~; u)j L for all 0 t T , all j~j s and all kuk r. <p> Sufficiency is clear. Now we show the necessity part. This is very similar to the proof of Lemma 3.1 in <ref> [2] </ref>, so only a sketch is given. Let fl be given as in Property 2 of the ISS definition. <p> t) decreases to 0 as t ! 1; and (3) ~ (s; t) (s; t) : It is an easy exercise to show that such a majorizing function ~ for (s; t) always exists; for details, we refer the reader to similar step in the proof of Proposition 2.5 in <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> This implies that for any such feedback, and for every solution x (t) of the corresponding system (5), it holds that d dt V (x (t)) ^ff 3 (V (x (t))) for almost all t. A simple comparison principle (see e.g. <ref> [2] </ref>) implies that there exists some KL-function ~ fi, which depends only on ^ff 3 and not on the particular k being used, such that V (x (t)) ~ fi ; 8t 0; for every solution x (t) of (5) and feedback bounded by , from which it follows that there <p> We conclude that system (20) is UGAS. Lemma 2.13 If system (1) is weakly robustly stable, then there exists an ISS-Lyapunov function for the system. 8 Proof. This is an easy consequence of the Converse Lyapunov Theorem for systems with bounded disturbances proved in <ref> [2] </ref>. The details are as follows. Assume that system (1) is weakly robustly stable. Then there exist a smooth function ' : IR n ! IR, such that '(~) (j~j) for some K 1 -function , for which the system (20) is UGAS, as defined earlier. <p> Assume that system (1) is weakly robustly stable. Then there exist a smooth function ' : IR n ! IR, such that '(~) (j~j) for some K 1 -function , for which the system (20) is UGAS, as defined earlier. It then follows from the Converse Lyapunov result in <ref> [2] </ref> that there exists a uniform smooth Lyapunov function V for the system (20), that is, a smooth V so that, for some positive definite K 1 -functions ff i , i = 1; 2; 3, it holds that ff 1 (j~j) V (~) ff 2 (j~j) 8~ 2 IR n

Reference-contexts: These notions are closely related to the topic of stability under perturbations (total stability), studied in the classical dynamical systems literature. In the late 1980s, one of the coauthors introduced a particular precise definition of input/state stability, and established a few basic results; see for instance <ref> [4] </ref>, [6], and [5]. These results then were applied in different areas, including observer design and new small-gain theorems; see for instance [7], [8], [1], and [3].

This motivates checking the ISS property by investigating ISS-Lyapunov functions for the given system. <p> The definition is intended as a nonlinear generalization of the bound jx (t)j j~j e fft + ckuk which holds for linear systems _x = Ax + Bu when the matrix A is asymptotically stable. Using this definition, it was proved in <ref> [4] </ref> and [6] that a system can be stabilized by a smooth feedback if and only if it is feedback equivalent to an ISS system. Thus the definition appears to be natural, and the further characterizations given later confirm this fact. <p> Also, without loss of generality, one can assume that ff 3 2 K 1 (cf. [2], Remark 4.1). Finally, observe that Equation (4) states that the derivative _ V along trajectories is negative definite for large enough x, given any control magnitude. In <ref> [4] </ref> as well as in the literature since the publication of that paper, the fact that a system is ISS has always been established by showing that there is an ISS-Lyapunov function. <p> is ISS if and only if there exist fi 2 KL and fl 2 K such that jx (t; ~; u)j max ffi (j~j ; t); fl (kuk)g 8~ 2 IR n ; 8u; 8t 0 : (8) The next lemma relates ISS to the "input/output stability" property introduced in <ref> [4] </ref>: Lemma 2.6 A system (1) is ISS if and only if there exist KL functions fi 0 ; fi 1 and a K-function fl such that, for any ~ 2 IR n and any input u, it holds that jx (t; ~; u)j fi 0 (j~j ; t) + fi <p> Since (j~j) '(~), (25) holds whenever jvj (j~j). Let (r) = 1 (r). Clearly is a function as required for Definition 2.2, and thus, V is an ISS-Lyapunov function for (1). The next lemma provides a Lyapunov-like criterion for input/state stability. It was introduced and proved in <ref> [4] </ref>. To make this work self-contained, we provide the statement together with its proof in this paper. Lemma 2.14 If system (1) admits an ISS-Lyapunov function, then it is ISS. Proof. Assume system (1) admits an ISS-Lyapunov function V .
