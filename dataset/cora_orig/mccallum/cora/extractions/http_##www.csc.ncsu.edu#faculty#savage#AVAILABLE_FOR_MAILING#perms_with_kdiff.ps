Abstract: Given (n; k) with n k 2 and k 6= 3, we show how to generate all permutations of n objects (each exactly once) so that successive permutations differ in exactly k positions, as do the first and last permutations. This solution generalizes known results for the specific cases where k = 2 and k = n. When k = 3, we show that it is possible to generate all even (odd) permutations of n objects so that successive permutations differ in exactly 3 positions.

Reference-contexts: The revolving door algorithm in [18] generates all k-sets so that successive sets differ in only one element. If we used this algorithm to generate 2-sets, neither property (1) nor (2) would be satisfied. Other algorithms ([6], <ref> [3] </ref>, [10]) can in some cases generate k-sets with the minimal change property, that is, so that successive sets differ in exactly one element and this element has either increased or decreased by 1.

Reference-contexts: In work to appear in his Ph.D. thesis, Chris Compton has shown that this graph is Hamiltonian <ref> [5] </ref>. In the case of the alternating group, with generating set the 3-cycles S = f (1 2 n), (1 3 n), : : : , (1 n 1 n) g, Gould and Roth have shown that the undirected Cayley graph is Hamiltonian [11].

Reference-contexts: More closely related to our listing is the strong minimal change (SMC) property <ref> [6] </ref>. That is, k-sets are generated so that if a k-set is represented as a sorted sequence, successive k-sets differ in only one position. <p> This is what property (1) requires: a listing of the n 2-sets of [n], with the SMC property, starting with 34 : : :n and ending at 1256 : : :n. We cannot apply directly the algorithm of <ref> [6] </ref> only because the algorithm of that paper starts with 12 : : : n 2 and ends with 34 : : :n. Note that although the sets f1, 2g and f1, 4g are adjacent in SMC order, their complements in f1; : : :; 4g are not.

Reference-contexts: Jackson's result is that every 2-connected, d-regular graph of at most 3d vertices is Hamiltonian. In the case k = n, the degree of each vertex in G [S] is the number of derangements of 1 : : : n, which is (see, e.g., <ref> [8] </ref>, pp. 9-10) 3 For n 3 this is at least n!(1 1=1! + 1=2! 1=3!) = n!=3: So, at least the vertex degree is large enough for Jackson's theorem to apply.

Reference-contexts: Proof. Construction of such a path depends on the parity of n. See Figure 5 for details. 2 There are many algorithms in the literature for generating the k-sets of an n-set. The revolving door algorithm in <ref> [18] </ref> generates all k-sets so that successive sets differ in only one element. If we used this algorithm to generate 2-sets, neither property (1) nor (2) would be satisfied. <p> See Figure 7. 8 Now, for the recursive construction, the list LI ST of permutations of 1 : : : n with k- differences is composed of two parts: LI ST = LI ST A; LI ST B (Following <ref> [18] </ref>, a comma is used to denote the concatenation of lists.) LI ST B will be obtained from LI ST A by swapping the first two positions in every permutation on LI ST A.

Reference-contexts: satisfying n k 2, is it possible to list all permutations so that successive permutations differ in exactly k positions? In this paper, we show by construction that the answer is yes, unless k = 3. (We have learned that Thomas Putnam, working independently, has recently solved the same problem <ref> [19] </ref>). When k = 3, two permutations which differ in exactly three positions, in fact, differ by a product of two 2-cycles, so that successive permutations must have the same parity.

Reference-contexts: Many practical problems require for their solution a sampling of random permutations or, worse, a search through all n! permutations. In order for such a search to be possible, even for moderate size n, permutation generation methods must be extremely efficient. A survey of efficient techniques is presented in <ref> [24] </ref>. <p> CCR8906500 1 elements. This was shown to be possible in several papers, including [26], [1], [2], and [9], which are described in <ref> [24] </ref>. In fact, it is possible even if the two elements exchanged are required to be in adjacent positions ([13], [25]). <p> Our motivation for studying this problem of permutation generation with k-differences is clearly not for efficient permutation generation, which would be better handled by techniques from <ref> [24] </ref>. Rather, we found the problem mathematically interesting, particularly in view of its combinatorial connections which are discussed below. Recently, permutation generation has been studied from a combinatorial perspective, due in part to its ties with some interesting graph theoretic problems.

In fact, it is possible even if the two elements exchanged are required to be in adjacent positions ([13], <ref> [25] </ref>). It is interesting to note that in the Wells-Boothroyd-Heap algorithms, the last permutation differs from the first permutation by a transposition only when n is odd, so the scheme is not "cyclic". <p> A question of interest, then, is whether or not G [S] has a Hamiltonian path or cycle. For example, by results cited above, G [S] is Hamiltonian when S allows only adjacent transpositions ([13], <ref> [25] </ref>) or when S allows only derangements and n 6= 3 ([7], [17]). As another example, it is shown in [15] that for a set S of transpositions (of specific positions), G [S] is Hamiltonian if the elements of S form a basis for the symmetric group.

Reference-contexts: In fact, G [S] is a Cayley graph and it is an open question whether even every (undirected) Cayley graph is Hamiltonian. No general results on Cayley graphs apply to show that the k-differences graph is Hamiltonian. A related problem due to Wilf <ref> [28] </ref> is whether G [S] is Hamiltonian when S allows only (1) a swap of the first two positions (i.e., 123 : : : n to 213 : : : n) or (2) a cyclic shift one position left or right of all positions (i.e., 123 : : : n to
