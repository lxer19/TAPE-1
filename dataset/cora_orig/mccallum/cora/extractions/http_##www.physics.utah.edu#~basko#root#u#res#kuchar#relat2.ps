Abstract: The Hamiltonian dynamics of spherically symmetric massive thin shells in the general relativity is considered. Two different constraint dynamical systems representing this dynamics have been described recently; the relation of these two systems is investigated. The symmetry groups of both systems are found. The systems are reduced to the presymplectic manifolds 1 and 2 , lest non-physical aspects like gauge fixings or embeddings in extended phase spaces hinder the argument. The following facts are shown. 1 is three- and 2 is five-dimensional; the description of the shell dynamics by 1 is incomplete so that some measurable properties of the shell cannot be predicted. 1 is locally equivalent to a subsystem of 2 and the corresponding local morphisms are not unique, due to the large symmetry group of 2 . The local equivalence explains why the same radial equation results from both systems; what is, however, the physical importance of just local, but not global equivalence of constraint dynamical systems remains unclear.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the gauge invariance is an issue, because a gauge fixation leads much more easily to gauge-dependent results in quantum gravity than, say, in the Yang-Mills field theory. This has to do with the so-called problem of time <ref> [1] </ref>, [2]. The term "semi-classical thinking" is to express uneasiness about the extensions to the gravidynamics of the naive assumption that every dynamics is a theory of motion of some objects in some spacetime (cf. `covariant quantization' [3], string theory [4], or `effective field theory' [5]).

This quantum theory lead to some unexpected results: 1. <p> The method, however, has several drawbacks. 1. The way from a dynamical equation to a Hamiltonian principle is non-unique and it is unclear how much the final quantum results depend on a particular 1 guess. Some kind of uniqueness has been shown in Ref. <ref> [9] </ref>, but this was still not completely reassuring, as we shall also see in the present paper. 2. <p> Finally, we shall find that the method of self-adjoint extension is incomplete in certain respect, and so there is some point to be said about the third problem, too. The plan of the paper is as follows. In Sec. 2, we shall briefly collect the results of Refs. <ref> [9] </ref> and [11] that will be needed so that the paper becomes self-contained. New is the systematic use of the Kruskal coordinates and more or less complete description of the symmetries that the systems admit. <p> Future research may show. 2 Description of the shell dynamics In this section, we briefly collect some results scattered in literature making so the paper self-contained. 2.1 The shell spacetime A thin-shell spacetime solution of Einstein equations will be described in this subsection following closely Ref. <ref> [9] </ref>. Consider two Kruskal spacetimes M 1 and M 2 with Schwarzschild masses E 1 and E 2 . Let 1 be a timelike hypersurface in M 1 and 2 be one in M 2 . <p> The spacetime around the shell already satisfies the Einstein equations; thus, the only non-trivial equation still to be satisfied is the jump condition, the so-called Israel equation [12]. It implies (for a derivation, see Ref. <ref> [9] </ref>) the following two equations for the embedding functions T * (s) and R (s) of the shell in M * , where * is a sign, * = 1 and s is the proper time along the radial generators of the surface. <p> We stress that the four possibilities are unambiguous (see Ref. <ref> [9] </ref>): for each (scattering) shell spacetime, only one of these is realized in both subspacetimes M simultaneously. 5 2.2 Inside-based approach In this subsection, we describe a relatively simple approach (cf. e.g. [7] and [9]) to the shell dynamics. <p> We stress that the four possibilities are unambiguous (see Ref. <ref> [9] </ref>): for each (scattering) shell spacetime, only one of these is realized in both subspacetimes M simultaneously. 5 2.2 Inside-based approach In this subsection, we describe a relatively simple approach (cf. e.g. [7] and [9]) to the shell dynamics. The first step of the approach is that only a subclass of the shell spacetimes is selected from all spherically symmetric shell spacetimes as described in the previous subsection, by fixing the value, E, say, of the Schwarzschild mass E in their internal subspacetimes. <p> Then the spacetime M 1 is a fixed, complete Kruskal spacetime and each shell spacetime defines a trajectory 1 in it. This trajectory satisfies Eq. (1) and (3) with * = 1. In Ref. <ref> [9] </ref> a proof is given that each such trajectory belongs to a unique shell spacetime; thas is, it determines the mass E + of the right subspacetime M + and the trajectory R + (t), T + (t) in it up to a constant shift of T + (t). <p> In this sense, the shell dynamics can be reduced to a dynamics of a particle-like object on a fixed two-dimensional spacetime M|the U -V -surface of the Kruskal spacetime M 1 . In Ref. <ref> [9] </ref>, the corresponding variational principle was shown to be uniquely determined (up to a coordinate-dependent factor in front of the super-Hamiltonian) if the super-Hamiltonian was required to be at most quadratic in momenta, and the value of the momentum conserved due to the time-shift symmetry was the negative of the Schwarzschild <p> the Schwarzschild time-shift Killing vector on M, F = g ab ~ a ~ b ; the potential W (x) is defined by W (R) := E 2R R (x) is the Schwarzschild radius function on M and M (R) is the mass function of the shell matter. 6 Ref. <ref> [9] </ref> contains a proof that the variation principle (4) implies the radial equation (1) and the time equation (3) with * = 1. The time equation (3) with * = +1 must be added by hand. <p> (P U _ U + P V _ V N C 1 ); (9) where C 1 = 2 (2E) 2 + 2 W (U P U V P V ) 2 7 Our definitions (5), (10) and (6) of C 1 and W differ from those given in Ref. <ref> [9] </ref> by the factor of F so that the super-Hamiltonian C 1 and the potential W are smooth everywhere.

The Hamiltonian formalism is reduced in Ref. [11] by spherical symmetry, using a transformation of canonical variables invented by Kuchar [13].
