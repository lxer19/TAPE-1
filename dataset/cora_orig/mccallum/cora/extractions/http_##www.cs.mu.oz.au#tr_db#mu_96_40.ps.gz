Reference-contexts: Most of these perform more general searches, rather than targeting a particular domain, such as papers. Also, most learn user interests or permit user feedback. For instance, LIRA <ref> [2] </ref> browses the Web for the user using an 5 URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator, which is an identifier of a Web page. 3 interest profile modified by user feedback on intermediate search results. The feedback is used to change the link selection heuristic, improving subsequent search results.

Reference-contexts: The dMARS CiFi uses dMARS V 1.6.11 <ref> [3] </ref>, which is an agent-oriented reasoning system capable of operating across a distributed network. This system provides a graphical user interface for developing multi-agent applications that can reason and make decisions in a changing world. Each agent in the application has a set of beliefs, goals and plans.

Reference-contexts: The feedback is used to change the link selection heuristic, improving subsequent search results. Fish-Search <ref> [4, 5] </ref>, traverses the Web looking for particular documents. The user specifies either keywords, a regular expression, or external filters that the contents of the document must match.

Reference-contexts: It remembers the user's interests based on the pages selected. Letizia [9] is an agent that infers user interests from browsing behaviour, and explores links using a best-first search with heuristics utilising the inferred user interests. Based on its exploration, Letizia can recommend links to follow. The LAW system <ref> [6] </ref> suggests links to the user as they browse the Web using a link and a page profile reflecting the user's interests. The profiles are also used in off-line searches to find interesting pages for the user.

Reference-contexts: BibAgent asks the user for traversal suggestions, and remembers useful search paths for future use. In contrast to BibAgent, CiFi navigates over Web pages finding citations without user intervention. CiFi also retrieves bibliographic files returned by AltaVista. 2.2 Internet Fish Internet Fish <ref> [8] </ref> is a class of information discovery tools with persistent be-haviour. The tools run continuously and can remember queries over time. Internet Fish like CiFi is based on a knowledge intensive approach.

Reference-contexts: Both systems employ a conceptual graph of Web pages and heuristic knowledge of likely locations of citations. The rule-based agent uses Prolog and an interface to the Web called LogicWeb <ref> [11, 10] </ref> to represent heuristics for guiding Web searching. This agent extends the work described in [12]. The multi-agent system constructs several agents on the basis of the conceptual graph, and allows these agents to search different types of pages in parallel using an event-driven approach. <p> For instance, a query to Ahoy may return the email addresses of several people with the same name. Implementation. CiFi is implemented in Prolog 10 , extended with abstractions to conveniently access the contents of Web pages. LogicWeb <ref> [11, 10] </ref> provides the abstraction by treating Web pages as logic program modules. This treatment of pages allows the pages' contents to be retrieved as Prolog facts.

Reference-contexts: Both systems employ a conceptual graph of Web pages and heuristic knowledge of likely locations of citations. The rule-based agent uses Prolog and an interface to the Web called LogicWeb [11, 10] to represent heuristics for guiding Web searching. This agent extends the work described in <ref> [12] </ref>. The multi-agent system constructs several agents on the basis of the conceptual graph, and allows these agents to search different types of pages in parallel using an event-driven approach. This system is built using dMARS, an agent-oriented reasoning system capable of operating across a distributed network. <p> The cue words for a page type are matched with the labels and 7 URLs of the links on a page to determine which links point to pages of that type. Examples of cue words used are detailed in <ref> [12] </ref>. The queries to search engines are constructed using the user's input and knowledge about the location and the format of the query string. <p> For instance, the information about links on a page are stored as facts in a module, enabling the link information to be examined using Prolog backtracking search. Prolog backtracking search mapped well to the required search behaviour as discussed in <ref> [12] </ref>. Also, it is convenient to express search heuristics and control rules in Prolog, and to make changes such as adding or removing rules. Prolog provides a more readable syntax for rules than imperative languages. <p> C is used to implement a fast string matching algorithm. Results. CiFi has been used to find a wide range of publications but little systematic testing has been done due to the rapid changing of applicable Web resources. The earlier version described in <ref> [12] </ref> successfully found citations in twenty out of thirty citation searches carried out.

Reference-contexts: We classify these agents into three categories: (1) agents for paper search, (2) Internet Fish, and (3) browsing agents. 2.1 Agents for Paper Search A tool called WebFind for automatically searching for scientific papers was introduced in <ref> [13] </ref>. The main idea of WebFind is to use external (non-Web) information sources to help retrieve information from the Web.

Reference-contexts: The profiles are also used in off-line searches to find interesting pages for the user. The profiles are created by machine learning techniques using training examples based on user feedback or the user's browsing behaviour. Almathaea <ref> [14] </ref> is a multi-agent information discovery and filtering system, based on artificial life ideas, such as evolution and natural selection. The system consists of cooperating information discovery and filtering agents.

Reference-contexts: In contrast to WebFind, CiFi looks for a citation to the paper which may, or may not, have a link to the actual paper. Also, CiFi uses a mixture of Web-based search engines and on-line databases, without depending on external information sources. BibAgent <ref> [15] </ref> semi-autonomously navigates over ftp directories (using the Alex file-system that integrates ftp directories) looking for a specified article. BibAgent examines readme files to aid its navigation, prioritises the directories to follow, and can retrieve the actual paper, or a completed bibliographic reference from bibliographic files (e.g.,.bib files).

Reference-contexts: The ordering of the top edges corresponds to an ordering of the search strategies. Subgraphs rooted at the top sites are followed depth-first. The graph guides the search from one page type to another. For instance, using the English-like notation in <ref> [16] </ref>, the following rule specifies the actions on an author's home page: WHEN ON author_home page SEARCH FOR 1. citation 2. link to X, WHERE author_home leads_to X.
