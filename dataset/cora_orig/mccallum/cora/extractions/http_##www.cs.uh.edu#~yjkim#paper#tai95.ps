Abstract: The paper describes an inductive learning environment called DELVAUX for classification tasks that learns PROSPECTOR-style, Bayesian rules from sets of examples. A genetic algorithm approach is used for learning Bayesian rule-sets, in which a population consists of sets of rule-sets that generate offspring through the exchange of rules, permitting fitter rule-sets to produce offspring with a higher probability. To deal with the premature convergence problem, fuzzy similarity measures for Bayesian rule-sets are introduced and the genetic algorithm approach is modified, so that similar rule-sets produce offspring with a lower probability, relying on a sharing function approach. Empirical results are presented that evaluate the benefits of the sharing function approach in our learning environment.

Reference-contexts: Another possible but quite different approach is the sharing function approach <ref> [1] </ref>. The main idea of the sharing function approach is to decrease the fitness of the individual proportional to the sharing value so that solutions with a high value of sharing will undergo a more severe fitness reduction resulting in less selection in the breeding process.

Reference-contexts: However, the benefits of other diversity maintaining approaches such as niche preservation and marriage restrictions should be explored by future research. As a related work, we performed some experiments to see if it is beneficial to use multiple rule-sets in the decision making process relying on the voting approach <ref> [6] </ref>. Using multiple rule-sets in the decision making shows some quite impressive empirical results, improving the inductive learning performance significantly.

Reference-contexts: One possible approach is the use of marriage restrictions <ref> [7] </ref>. In this approach, breeding between similar rule-sets is restricted for example, two rule-sets whose similarity is below a threshold value are only allowed to produce an offspring, if the offspring's fitness is greater than the average fitness of its parents.
