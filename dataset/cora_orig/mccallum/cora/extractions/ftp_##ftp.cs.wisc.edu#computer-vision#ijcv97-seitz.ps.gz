Abstract: This paper presents a general framework for image-based analysis of 3D repeating motions that addresses two limitations in the state of the art. First, the assumption that a motion be perfectly even from one cycle to the next is relaxed. Real repeating motions tend not to be perfectly even, i.e., the length of a cycle varies through time because of physically important changes in the scene. A generalization of period is defined for repeating motions that makes this temporal variation explicit. This representation, called the period trace, is compact and purely temporal, describing the evolution of an object or scene without reference to spatial quantities such as position or velocity. Second, the requirement that the observer be stationary is removed. Observer motion complicates image analysis because an object that undergoes a 3D repeating motion will generally not produce a repeating sequence of images. Using principles of affine invariance, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for an image sequence to be the projection of a 3D repeating motion, accounting for changes in viewpoint and other camera parameters. Unlike previous work in visual invariance, however, our approach is applicable to objects and scenes whose motion is highly non-rigid. Experiments on real image sequences demonstrate how the approach may be used to detect several types of purely temporal motion features, relating to motion trends and irregularities. Applications to athletic and medical motion analysis are discussed.

In many applications, however, we are interested in the temporal evolution of an object or a scene and not its instantaneous shape.

Reference-contexts: Since then, motion-based recognition has become an active area of study within computer vision. These efforts include identification of pedestrians (Hogg, 1983; Rohr, 1993), MLD-based motion recognition <ref> (Goddard, 1989) </ref>, hand gesture recognition (Darrell and Pentland, 1993; Davis and Shah, 1994), interpretation of facial expressions (Yacoob and Davis, 1994; Essa and Pentland, 1994), and temporal textures (Polana and Nelson, 1992). <p> Motion Classes Most existing representations of motion describe how a set of intrinsic parameters of a specific object model change over time.

Reference-contexts: In particular, a view-invariant match function is presented in Section 5. In addition to incorporating forms of invariance, match functions also provide a natural way of incorporating different methods for comparing images. This framework incorporates existing metrics such as frame difference, optical flow, Hausdorff distance <ref> (Huttenlocher et al., 1993) </ref>, and recent rigidity tests (Seitz and Dyer, 1994a; Soatto and Perona, 1994; McReynolds and Lowe, 1995).

Reference-contexts: However, this strategy is designed for near-periodic sequences; highly irregular cyclic sequences may require a more sophisticated initialization procedure, perhaps incorporating user interaction, as in <ref> (Kass et al., 1988) </ref>. 6.3.

Reference-contexts: Detection of irregularity information has applications in athletic and medical motion analysis. By analyzing the variance of the period in several cycles of a runner's gait or a swimmer's stroke, anomalies can be located providing feedback on specific areas which may need improvement <ref> (Perry, 1990) </ref>. Medical imagery can be analyzed using the same techniques, for instance to detect unevenness in a heart's beating motion.

Reference-contexts: However, it is still necessary to evaluate the significance of a solution in order to discriminate between a cyclic and a non-cyclic motion. For this purpose we use a statistical measure based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test <ref> (Press et al., 1988) </ref> . The quality of a computed period trace can be assessed by considering the problem within the context of sampling theory. <p> For an image sequence, = fI 1 ; : : : ; I k g, M is approximated by M 0 = fd (I s ; I t ) j 1 s &lt; t kg. For details on how to calculate the K-S statistic, consult <ref> (Press et al., 1988) </ref>. The P-value of a candidate period trace is evaluated by applying the K-S test to S and M 0 .

(9) can be expressed as M = ~ M + M 0 where ~ M = U ~ V and M 0 = U 0 V. ~ M is the optimal (in an RMS sense) rank-3 approximation of M <ref> (Stewart, 1973) </ref>. Hence, M 0 is the minimal perturbation of M that produces a match. Therefore, dist A () = kM 0 k rms . The latter term is just k 0 k rms since U and V are orthogonal, and the result follows.
