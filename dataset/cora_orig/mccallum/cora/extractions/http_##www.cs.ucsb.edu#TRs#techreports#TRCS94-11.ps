Reference-contexts: CMS provides such a framework. In its current version, the actual implementation of the system support for modeling schemas is embedded in a special subsystem called GOOSE <ref> [AE93, AE94] </ref>. Its main role is to track the data interdependencies and to provide persistent data structures that represent the computational aspects of modeling schemas. Existing systems generally provide the functionality to perform computational steps separately. <p> All primitive CML commands are stored in predefined structures that are accessible to the con-figurator. Depending upon the specifications provided in tier 1, and the underlying DBMS, the configurator generates a syntactically correct query. 7.5 Modeling Support Finally, the modeling support is implemented using GOOSE <ref> [AE93, AE94] </ref>. GOOSE is organized in two levels: the object and the process levels. The organization of the architecture reflects this conceptual division, the process base provides support for persistent projects, the object base provides support for persistent objects.

Reference-contexts: For the abstract R-structure, we have: CREATE ABSTRACT R-STRUCTURE DEM WHERE SUPER R-STRUCTURES - Rectangular_Grid_Maps - R-DOMAIN r-domain (DEM) TRANSFORMATIONS transformations (DEM) RELATIONS relations (DEM) INSTANCES instances (DEM) Abstract R-structures provide "external" specifications of concrete R-structures similar in spirit to abstract data types <ref> [BDMN73] </ref>. An abstract R-structure may be instantiated by more than one concrete R-structure. For a concrete R-structure, we have: CREATE CONCRETE R-STRUCTURE DEM.peg WHERE R-DOMAIN = r-domain (DEM.peg) TRANSFORMATIONS transformations (DEM.peg) RELATIONS relations (DEM.peg) INSTANCES instances (DEM.peg) (where peg represents point elevation grid).

Reference-contexts: This performs the task of processing CML queries, managing the storage of data and its access over a distributed network of data sites. The current implementation of CMS uses POSTGRES as its data manager and Prospero <ref> [Neu92] </ref> as its (distributed) file manager. The integration of the Prospero file system with CML and POSTGRES allows POSTGRES to access virtual database object files "locally", although the files may reside physically on remote machines and be accessed using ftp or other methods.

Reference-contexts: In relation to standard R-structures, we note that there are, for example, various data transfer standards that may serve as a basis for specific concrete R-structures. An excellent example is the recently adopted Federal Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) <ref> [SDT92] </ref> that provides logical specifications and data structures for an important subset of spatial data types. 4.1 R-structures for the Hydrological Application In Figure 4, we illustrate a small fragment of a collection of (abstract) R-structures that may be employed representing the hydrologic flow problem.

Reference-contexts: Using objects to manipulate and refer to data has the advantage that both the interpretation of the data and the data itself can be accessed from a common reference. In most systems, the meaning of the dataset is exogenous and not found in the dataset itself <ref> [Tob79] </ref> which forces the user to resort to external sources to find such information. Similarly, a process is a data structure that stores information about a particular computation. In particular, a process consists of a set of inputs, a computation and a set of outputs.
