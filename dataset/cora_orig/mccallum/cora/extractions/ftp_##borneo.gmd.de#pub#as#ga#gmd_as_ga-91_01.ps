Abstract: The parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) uses two major modifications compared to the genetic algorithm. Firstly, selection for mating is distributed. Individuals live in a 2-D world. Selection of a mate is done by each individual independently in its neighborhood. Secondly, each individual may improve its fitness during its lifetime by e.g. local hill-climbing. The PGA is totally asynchronous, running with maximal efficiency on MIMD parallel computers. The search strategy of the PGA is based on a small number of active and intelligent individuals, whereas a GA uses a large population of passive individuals. We will investigate the PGA with deceptive problems and the traveling salesman problem. We outline why and when the PGA is succesful. Abstractly, a PGA is a parallel search with information exchange between the individuals. If we represent the optimization problem as a fitness landscape in a certain configuration space, we see, that a PGA tries to jump from two local minima to a third, still better local minima, by using the crossover operator. This jump is (probabilistically) successful, if the fitness landscape has a certain correlation. We show the correlation for the traveling salesman problem by a configuration space analysis. The PGA explores implicitly the above correlation.

Reference-contexts: A new configuration is accepted if it is better than the old one. This strategy can be seen as a simple evolutionary algorithm in the space of all local optima. Multistart hill-climbing has been also investigated by Ackley <ref> [Ack87] </ref>. Unfortunately he called it iterated hill-climbing. But our notion is in accordance to the notion in mathematical optimization. We will analyse these two strategies with two hill-climbing strategies next ascent nahc and steepest ascent sahc.

Reference-contexts: The results are shown in table 3. The problem instances starting with GRO can be found in [GH88]. GRO532 is the Padberg-Rinaldi problem mentioned above. The reference point is given by simulated annealing SA according to the cooling schedule of Aarts et al. <ref> [AK89] </ref>. The results demonstrate the advantage of the MPX crossing-over. The genetic versions Gen2Opt and GenLK of 2-Opt and Lin-Kernighan, respectively, perform clearly better than their multistart companions, despite the penalty of the convergence constraint. Moreover, GenLK is superior to the other algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The subpopulations are configured as a binary n-cube. A similar approach is done by Pettey et al. [PS89]. In the implementation of Cohoon et al. <ref> [CHMR87] </ref> it is assumed that each subpopulation is connected to each other. The algorithm from Manderick et al. [MS89] has been derived from our PGA.

Reference-contexts: For mathematical convenience it is asssumed that the position of a parent at the time it gives birth relative to that of its offspring when the latter reproduces is normally distributed. Felsenstein <ref> [Fel75] </ref> has shown that in many cases the above models lead to unrealistic clumping of individuals and concluded, that they are biologically irrelevant. There have been many attempts to investigate spatial population structures by computer simulations, but they did not have a major influence.

Reference-contexts: The issue raised by Wright and Fisher is still not settled. Because of the difficulty of solving the problem by mathematical analysis, population genetics has unfortunately lost interest in the problem. A good survey of the different population models can be found in Felsenstein <ref> [Fel76] </ref>. The PGA implements Wright's model. The two phases of Wright's theory can actually be observed. But the second phase performs differently. The biggest changes of the population occur at the time after migration between the subpopulations.

Reference-contexts: Then the second phase sets in. This subgroup now has a higher fitness than other subgroups and will tend to displace them until eventually the whole population has the new, favorable gene combination. Then the whole process starts again. Fisher <ref> [Fis58] </ref>, in contrast, argued that no such theory is needed. In a highly multidimensional fitness surface, the peaks are not very high and are connected by fairly high ridges, always shifting because of environmental changes.

Reference-contexts: The PGA is very robust with respect to the mutation rate. We always use as mutation rate just the inverse of the length of the chromosome. In contrast the computation of a reasonable mutation rate for iterated hill-climbing needs information about the problem. Goldberg <ref> [GDK90] </ref> suggested two extensions of the deceptive problems. One extension is to vary the size of the subfunctions, the other to vary the scale. A varying scale does not affect iterated hill-climbing because of the hard selection used.

Reference-contexts: In the latter case they used a pair of improvement operators, the dynamical k-swap and the additional 4-swap as described in [LK73]. The results are shown in table 3. The problem instances starting with GRO can be found in <ref> [GH88] </ref>. GRO532 is the Padberg-Rinaldi problem mentioned above.

Reference-contexts: The search strategy of a genetic algorithm and the PGA especially can be explained much more easily. The introduction of schemata only creates artificial confusion. The search strategy is mainly driven by the crossover operator. It can best be described as a scatter search <ref> [Glo77] </ref>, where new points are sampled between probabilistically chosen parent points. Because of the selection operator, the points get closer and closer. The closer the parent points are to each other, the smaller is the sampling area for new points.

Reference-contexts: In biological terms, evolutionary algorithms model natural evolution by asexual reproduction with mutation and selection. Search algorithms which model sexual reproduction are called genetic algorithms. They were invented by Holland [Hol75]. Recent surveys can be found in <ref> [Gol89a] </ref> and [Sch89]. Genetic Algorithm STEP0: Define a genetic representation of the problem STEP1: Create an initial population P (0) = x 0 1 ; ::x 0 STEP2: Compute the average fitness F = P N i F (x i )=N . <p> We now turn to the analysis of crossing-over. 5 The schema theorem revisited Many researchers in the genetic algorithm community refer to the schema theorem to explain the search strategy of genetic algorithms. For this reason it is also called the "Fundamental Theorem of Genetic Algorithms" <ref> [Gol89a] </ref>. The usual interpretation of the fundamental theorem claims that a genetic algorithm with binary representation makes an optimal allocation of the sample points given the information at hand. We believe that it is not worthwhile to discuss all the diffuse interpretations in detail.

Reference-contexts: The importance of a spatial population structure on evolution is discussed in section 4. The next four sections show the influence of hill-climbing and crossing-over on the PGA. Analytical and numerical results are presented for deceptive problems proposed by Goldberg <ref> [Gol89b] </ref>. The more difficult TSP is discussed in sections 9 and 10. <p> We will use the same deceptive problem in the next section to explain the search strategy of the PGA in simple terms. The theory of deceptive problems has been developed by Goldberg et al. <ref> [Gol89b] </ref>. <p> We also make a short comparison with other simulations of deceptive problems. In our PGA simulations we used a very small population size ( 16 or 32) in order to reduce the amount of computation. Goldberg <ref> [Gol89b] </ref> investigated the deceptive problems E10 and U10 with a standard GA of population size 2000. He reported 40000 function evaluations for the simple GA and 40600 for his messy genetic algorithm mGA, both for the function E10.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we try to explain the search strategy of the PGA in discrete optimization problems. Numerical results for the traveling salesman problem TSP, the quadratic assignment problem and the graph partitioning problem can be found in <ref> [GS89] </ref>, [Muh89] and [vLM91]. In all these applications we have used the same algorithm with only slight modifications. We have taken the largest published problem instances known to us. The PGA found solutions, which are comparable or even better than any other solution found by other heuristics.

Reference-contexts: OPT 2 (TSP) Given are n cities. The task of the salesman is to visit all cities once so that the overall tourlength is minimal. This problem has been investigated in [MGSK88] ,[GS89] and <ref> [GS91] </ref> with the PGA. The genetic representation is straightforward. The gene at locus i of the chromosome codes the edge (or link) which leaves city i. With this coding, the genes are not independent from each other. <p> The second measure is to compare the quality of the solutions after a fixed amount of time. A detailed study of the performance of the PGA based on the first measure has been done in <ref> [GS91] </ref>. <p> Moreover, GenLK is superior to the other algorithms. This shows the advantage of using a sophisticated local search method in the PGA. The absolute quality of the above solutions is worse than the solutions we obtained with the PGA <ref> [GS91] </ref>. This can be explained by the experimental setup, which required a convergence within the time limit given by simulated annealing.
