Abstract: Emotions were proven to lead an important role in human intelligence. Intelligent agents research produced many emotional agents. Research on human psychology had long considered the notion of an emotion (e.g., happy) to be a matter of degree; however, most existing research on emotional intelligent agents treat emotions as a black-and-white matter. We are proposing a model called FLAME - Fuzzy Logic Adaptive Model of Emotions. FLAME was modeled to produce emotions and to simulate the emotional intelligence process. FLAME was built using fuzzy rules to explore the capability of fuzzy logic in modeling the emotional process. Fuzzy logic helped us in capturing the fuzzy and complex nature of emotions. Throughout this paper we will try to point out the advantages of using fuzzy modeling over conventional models to simulate a better illusion of reality.

Reference-contexts: Pain was modeled by R. Schumacher and M. Velden [18] and again by S. Tayrers book [24]. Some hormones sent by the brain sometimes inhibit pain; this idea was adopted by Bolles and Fanselow, who tried to understand the relation between fear and pain <ref> [3] </ref>. Inspired by these psychological models and the growing interest in AI, many models that simulate the human mind have been proposed. A description of models of emotions from early 1960s until the 1980s was presented by R. Pfeifer [12]. <p> After firing the rules and getting a mixture of emotions, we will filter the emotion mixture to get an emotional state. The mixture is filtered using some inhibition factors such as the ones employed by Bolles and Fanslow <ref> [3] </ref>. The emotional state will then pass through a fuzzy mapping phase to determine a behavior. Fuzzy logic is used once again to determine a behavior given a set of emotions. The behavior depends on the emotions of the agent and the situation or the event that occurred.

Reference-contexts: A. Demasio presented some neurological evidence to prove that emotions do in fact play an active and important role in the human decision-making process <ref> [4] </ref>. The interaction between the emotional process and the cognitive process may explain why humans excel at making decisions based on incomplete information - acting on our gut-feelings. Following this major breakthrough, many terms emerged, including emotional intelligence, social intelligence, IQ-based social intelligence, and EQ-based social intelligence.

Reference-contexts: This requires self-awareness, self-control and self-perception. Moreover, this also requires understanding of other peoples emotions. Thus, EQ-social intelligence was defined as the use of emotional intelligence to develop a more profound communication pattern between a group of people <ref> [5] </ref>. Using fuzzy modeling proved to produce a more representative picture of the emotional process, and thus it might produce better believable agents. <p> Thus, it is not surprising to see many papers/books proposing models of emotions and behaviors. Among the neurological models, LeDoux published his book, The Emotional Brain, to explore the emotional process in the brain [7]. More recently, D. Goleman explained the idea of emotional intelligence and its importance in <ref> [5] </ref>. While in the psychology field, D. Price and J. Barrell developed a mathematical model that described emotions in terms of desires and expectations [13]. Pain was modeled by R. Schumacher and M. Velden [18] and again by S. Tayrers book [24].

Reference-contexts: An attempt was made by S. Sugano and T. Ogata [23] to simulate the human mind through an electrically wired robot. A prototype of the decision-making process was developed by Inoue <ref> [6] </ref>, they used neural networks to simulate behavior. The topic of emotion was regarded as a very challenging topic, since it was hard to fully understand how we feel and why we do feel that way.

Reference-contexts: By the 1990s, the Japanese researchers were interested in a system that can communicate with humans. Emotions were regarded as one of the most important factors in communication. Thus, by 1994, an effort was made by Masuyma to formulate the human emotions into a set of rules <ref> [9] </ref>. An attempt was made by S. Sugano and T. Ogata [23] to simulate the human mind through an electrically wired robot. A prototype of the decision-making process was developed by Inoue [6], they used neural networks to simulate behavior.

Reference-contexts: Today, new evidence has answered the question that Minsky had posed. Minsky, writing on the human mind, said, the question is not whether intelligent machines can have any emotions, but whether machines can be intelligent without any emotions <ref> [10] </ref>. A. Demasio presented some neurological evidence to prove that emotions do in fact play an active and important role in the human decision-making process [4].

Reference-contexts: Searching for a better solution, researchers on agents technology began working on emotions. J. Bates is building a believable agent (OZ project) [1, 2, 14] using the model described in The Structure of Emotions by Ortony, Clore and Collins <ref> [11] </ref>. The MIT lab is also producing an emotional multi-agent project [26]. The model only describes basic emotions and innate reactions; however, it presents a good starting point for building computer simulations of emotion. <p> The desirability of the event was measured as a true or false concept. The model triggered emotions according to the desirability factor. They used Ortony et al.s model <ref> [11] </ref> to formulate the rules for the triggering process. Emotions were triggered with different intensities. Intensities are degrees, say a number between 1 and 10, that depicts the strength of an emotion. The intensity degree is then used to map the resulting emotions to a behavior. <p> Mamdanis model uses sup-min to get the matching degrees for the n rules. After calculating the desirability of an event, we employ a variation of Orontys model <ref> [11] </ref> to define the emotion triggered by the situation and the event. For example to get the intensity of joy, we employ the following rule: Joy = the occurrence of a desirable event.
