Title: Using a Text Planner to Model the Behavior of Human Tutors in an ITS

Abstract: C IRCSIM Tutor v. 3 is a natural-language based intelligent tutoring system (ITS) for cardiac physiology currently under development. In this paper we describe how the C IRCSIM Tutor text planner uses a small set of primitives to generate a large and varied set of dialogues which respond to the students concerns and display detailed knowledge of the subject matter. We start by describing our main conceptual data structure, the dialogue schema, and the data structure used to implement it, the dialogue schema section. We explain how the semantic forms which constitute the dialogue schemata are transformed into lower-level primitives which can be realized as text for the student. We illustrate how a single dialogue schema can be used to generate major discourse phenomena of interest to tutoring researchers, such as hint, explanation, and interactive explanation. Finally, we demonstrate how the planner interpolates responses to the student into the conversation without losing coherence.

Reference-contexts: In this section we give brief illustrations of the two most common types of update: adding a verbal response before continuing with the plan, and changing the plan. 4.1. Verbal responses to the students utterance In the typical dialogue pattern, predicted by the Conversation Analysis school <ref> (Sinclair & Coulthard, 1975) </ref> and observed in our transcripts, every turn has the following basic structure: Turn: Response to students previous statement Acknowledgment of students statement (optional) Content-oriented reply (optional) New material (optional) Question or request for the student Although human tutors dont need to, the mechanized tutor always ends a
