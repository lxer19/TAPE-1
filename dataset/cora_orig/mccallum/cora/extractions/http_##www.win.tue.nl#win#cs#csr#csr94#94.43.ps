Abstract: Dijkstra and Scholten have formulated a theorem stating that all disjunctivity properties of a predicate transformer are preserved by the construction of least prefix points. An alternative proof of their theorem is presented based on two fundamental fixed point theorems, the abstraction theorem and the fusion theorem, and the fact that suprema in a lattice are defined by a Galois connection. The abstraction theorem seems to be new; the fusion theorem is known but its importance does not seem to be fully recognised. The main point of the paper is to discuss the process of drawing inspiration from lattice theory to formulate theorems in category theory (first advocated by Lambek in 1968). We advance the view that, in order to contribute to the development of programming methodology, category theory may be profitably regarded as "constructive" lattice theory in which the added value lies in establishing that the constructions are "coherent". This paper was specially prepared for presentation at the meeting of IFIP Working Group 2.3 (Programming Methodology), June 1994. Knowledge of (elementary) lattice theory is assumed. Knowledge of category theory is not.

Reference-contexts: But their simplicity belies the breadth of their applicability and thus their importance. Several examples of the use of -fusion in the context of a study of mathematical induction are presented in [2]; many more examples are included in Voerman's forthcoming thesis [19]. Applications of -abstraction are considered in <ref> [5] </ref>. We are not aware of any publication where the corresponding theorems in category theory are stated. Particular instances of the categorical "beautiful theorem" are known to us but we are also not aware of any publication in which the theorem is stated at the same level of generality. <p> Particular instances of the categorical "beautiful theorem" are known to us but we are also not aware of any publication in which the theorem is stated at the same level of generality. In fact, in the current paper we omit most proofs. Full proofs are included in <ref> [5] </ref> but the diligent reader should be able to fill in all proofs for themself provided careful note is taken of the order in which lemmas are presented. In the current paper we also make several severe assumptions in order to focus the presentation. In particular, we assume 3 (co)completeness. <p> This is not necessary but is done in order to avoid encumbering the statement of each lemma and theorem with details of which least fixed points (initial algebras) are assumed to exist and which can be inferred to exist. These simplifying assumptions are not made in the companion paper <ref> [5] </ref> , the theorems there being stated in full generality. In the next section we review properties of Galois connections and then recall how suprema in a complete lattice are defined via such a connection. <p> There is, however, much more to (24) than just the construction of witnesses. If one unfolds all the definitions involved in its formulation then one discovers that it encapsulates a very great deal of detail. Accordingly, its proof requires quite some effort. Our own proof <ref> [5] </ref>, including the proof of (23) as lemma, extends to three pages of detailed calculations. <p> This emphasises the more fundamental nature of the abstraction and fusion theorems. The abstraction and fusion theorems are not the only theorems that are needed to construct a rich (constructive) calculus of initial algebras. Elsewhere <ref> [5] </ref> we have generalised the following three fixed point rules to category theory.

The theorem is about the preservation of properties of suprema when constructing least prefix points. (There is of course a dual theorem concerning infima and greatest postfix points.) In order to formulate the theorem precisely we need to introduce a few definitions.

Reference-contexts: to verify that the pair (K [ ; K) forms an adjunction between the categories Alg:G and Alg:H , with the lower and upper adjungates defined in the same way as those of the adjunction (F [ ; F ). (This theorem has been independently observed by Hermida and Jacobs <ref> [10] </ref>.) An immediate corollary is that if Alg:G has an initial object muG then K [ :muG is an initial object of Alg:H (since in general lower adjoints map initial objects to initial objects).

The conventional notation for the application of F * to natural transformation j is F j , and of * F is jF in line with the convention that composition of functors is denoted by their juxtaposition |see for example <ref> [13] </ref>| . We shall, however, write F * j and j * F , respectively, thus keeping the composition operator visible. <p> There is a large number of equivalent definitions of an adjunction.

The corresponding limit theorem in category theory is, however. <p> The conclusion is that K 2 (A B) A , i.e. K is a functor from the category A to the functor category A B . 5 The name "diagonal functor" is that used by Mac Lane <ref> [14, p67] </ref>.

Confusingly, on p. 62 Mac Lane also uses the name "diagonal functor" and the symbol 4 for the functor that doubles its argument (the justification presumably being that the former generalises the latter). <p> As mentioned earlier, this is theorem 1 on p.111 of <ref> [14] </ref>.
