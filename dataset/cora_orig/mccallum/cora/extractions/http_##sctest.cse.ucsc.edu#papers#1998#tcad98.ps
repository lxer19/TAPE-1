Title: Diagnosing Realistic Bridging Faults with Single Stuck-at Information  
Author: David B. Lavo Student Member, IEEE Brian Chess Member, IEEE Tracy Larrabee Senior Member, IEEE F. Joel Ferguson Member, IEEE 
Abstract: Successful failure analysis requires accurate fault diagnosis. This paper presents a method for diagnosing bridging faults that improves on previous methods. The new method uses single stuck-at fault signatures, produces accurate and precise diagnoses, and takes into account imperfect fault modeling; it accomplishes this by introducing the concepts of match restriction, match requirement, and match ranking.

Reference-contexts: A description of the behavior and assumptions about the nature of a logic fault is referred to as a fault model <ref> [1] </ref>. As with testing, diagnosis traditionally involves the choice of a fault model; the most popular fault model for both testing and diagnosis is the single stuck-at fault model, in which a node in the circuit is assumed to be unable to change its logic value. <p> The traditional method of fault diagnosis, referred to as cause-effect analysis by Abramovici et al. <ref> [1] </ref>, has been described by Aitken [7] as test-based fault localization: identification of a defect location by comparing failures observed on a tester with those predicted by fault simulation.

Reference-contexts: These simplifying assumptions, however, enabled an approach to diagnosing bridging faults using relatively simple stuck-at information, a desirable feature considering the expense of realistic fault models. 3.1 MMA theory The MMA diagnostic theory, described below, followed from some relatively simple observations about bridging fault behavior under the voting model <ref> [2] </ref>. If Vector v detects a bridging fault in a CMOS circuit, the two bridged nodes necessarily have opposite fault-free logic values when v is applied. The driving transistor networks of these two nodes will each attempt to assert competing logic values on the bridge.

Reference-contexts: Because gate input logic thresholds are not identical, different downstream gates can interpret the voltage as different logic values: this phenomenon is known as the Byzantine Generals Problem [29] for bridging faults <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. Figure 2 shows a simple example of voltage interpretation in the presence of variable logic thresholds. This behavior has important implications for diagnosis: the propagation conditions for the error induced by a bridging fault are not necessarily the same as those caused by a stuck-at fault.

Reference-contexts: The traditional method of fault diagnosis, referred to as cause-effect analysis by Abramovici et al. [1], has been described by Aitken <ref> [7] </ref> as test-based fault localization: identification of a defect location by comparing failures observed on a tester with those predicted by fault simulation. A fault simulator describes the behavior of a circuit in the presence of a fault, usually in the form of a fault signature. <p> The example systems described above characterize the general trend of stuck-at model diagnosis, from simple to complex matching algorithms. It has become evident that many failures in CMOS circuits do not behave exactly like single stuck-at faults <ref> [7] </ref>. The inclusion of increasingly more-complicated algorithms is the necessary result of the reliance of these systems on the overly-simple single stuck-at fault model. 2.3 Bridging fault diagnosis Several approaches have been taken towards incorporating the bridging fault model into traditional test-based fault localization. <p> In addition, actual bridging fault behavior often diverges from simulated behavior, requiring validation and refinement of the models <ref> [7] </ref>. The continued search for a method of diagnosing bridging faults using inexpensive stuck-at signatures is driven by the cost and complexity of realistic fault models; this paper presents such an approach, yielding similar results to the realistic fault model approach, but at a much lower cost.

This approach is truly cause-effect analysis using the bridging fault-model: the fault candidates are the same faults targeted for diagnosis. The results presented by the authors indicate both excellent accuracy and precision: there are very few misleading diagnoses, and the resulting diagnoses are very small (less than 10 candidates).

Reference-contexts: In addition, tests on a circuit are limited to examining logic values at the circuit outputs. The proposed technique is demonstrated with simulated bridging faults on the ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits <ref> [10] </ref>. The results given indicate the success of the technique; diagnoses are of very high quality, both accurate and precise, and are often ideal: the correct identification of a single pair of shorted circuit nodes. <p> Section 4.2 shows that the size of the average diagnosis using the MMA technique on the ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits <ref> [10] </ref>, for these experiments, is at least 33 matches (for the C880) and can reach over 200 matches (for the C7552). <p> Section 4.2 shows that up to 10% of the diagnostic trials resulted in incorrect diagnoses because of the Byzantine Generals Problem. 4 Experimental considerations Before reporting on the quality of the original MMA technique as applied to the ISCAS-85 circuits <ref> [10] </ref>, this section describes the creation of composite signatures, and the selection of faulty circuits to be considered in diagnosis experiments. It also describes the acquisition of faulty circuit behaviors, the creation of the initial stuck-at signatures, and an important distinction in the interpretation of the MMA theorem.

A proposed solution to this problem is the concept of current signatures <ref> [11, 21, 22, 43] </ref>, which considers differential current levels between tests, rather than absolute values, to infer about the presence and identity of circuit defects. 2.4 Other approaches Several approaches to fault diagnosis are not neatly categorized by the combination of fault model and algorithm specification used above.

A test set for which many faults have identical signatures has poor diagnostic resolution, as the likelihood of a precise diagnosis is small. Conversely, if a test set produces a unique signature for each fault, it is considered to have ideal diagnostic resolution.

Reference-contexts: The matching algorithm was simple subset matching; this technique is described in detail in Section 3. A more conventional application of stuck-at signatures, paired with a sophisticated matching algorithm, was presented by Chakravarty and Gong <ref> [13] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A related Teradyne system [37] introduced the processing of possible-detects, or outputs in stuck-at signatures that have unknown logic values, into the matching process. A system that uses a more sophisticated algorithm of parameterized matching has been presented by De and Gunda <ref> [18] </ref>; in this system, the user can specify the relative importance of misprediction and non-prediction. A quantitative ranking is assigned to each stuck-at fault, from which some indication can be made about the existence of multiple stuck-at faults or possibly some unmodeled (non-stuck-at) faults. <p> The observed output errors that are correctly predicted by the candidate are represented as set I (the intersection), the output errors that are predicted by the candidate but not observed are set M (the mispredictions|this is also known as the number of nodetects <ref> [18] </ref>), and the output errors that are observed but not predicted by the candidate are N (the nonpredictions). The original MMA technique had a single, simple criterion for inclusion in a diagnosis motivated by the design of composite signatures. <p> Given that the composite signature candidates are now ranked, it is a simple matter to relax the strict criteria for inclusion in a diagnosis, resulting in a policy that will recover diagnoses that would otherwise fail. A standard technique used by many diagnostic algorithms <ref> [36, 18] </ref> is to first select an acceptable diagnosis size, d, and then construct a diagnosis of the d highest-ranked candidates.

The concepts of fault and fault model are separate from that of a defect, which usually refers to the physical mechanism, such as an electrical short or open, that produces the incorrect behavior of the circuit.

Reference-contexts: Many simple approaches, such as the Teradyne-based [37] system demonstrated in Section 6, merely compared stuck-at signatures to the observed behavior, and implicated the (single) nodes that most closely matched. A novel approach was presented by Millman, McCluskey, and Acken <ref> [33] </ref>, in which pseudo-signatures for bridging faults were constructed from stuck-at signatures for the bridged nodes. The matching algorithm was simple subset matching; this technique is described in detail in Section 3. <p> great deal of flexibility in targeting faults, its computational cost and diagnostic precision are matters of concern. 3 The MMA algorithm This paper investigates and improves a bridging fault diagnosis technique using the single stuck-at fault model that was proposed by Millman, McCluskey, and Acken (henceforth called the MMA technique) <ref> [33] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the actual defect mechanism was interpreted strictly as a single stuck-at circuit node; other defect types could necessarily not be precisely diagnosed. Many early systems of VLSI diagnosis, such as Western Electric Company's DORA [34] and an early approach of Teradyne, Inc. <ref> [36] </ref>, attempted to incorporate the concept of test-based fault localization with the previous-generation method of diagnosis, called guided-probe analysis. Guided-probe analysis employed a physical voltage probe and feedback from an analysis algorithm to intelligently select accessible circuit nodes for evaluation. <p> Given that the composite signature candidates are now ranked, it is a simple matter to relax the strict criteria for inclusion in a diagnosis, resulting in a policy that will recover diagnoses that would otherwise fail. A standard technique used by many diagnostic algorithms <ref> [36, 18] </ref> is to first select an acceptable diagnosis size, d, and then construct a diagnosis of the d highest-ranked candidates.

Reference-contexts: These have commonly become known as misprediction and non-prediction penalties, respectively. A related Teradyne system <ref> [37] </ref> introduced the processing of possible-detects, or outputs in stuck-at signatures that have unknown logic values, into the matching process. <p> The first steps retained the legacy of stuck-at signatures, using these readily-available fault descriptions to approximate or identify bridging fault behavior. Many simple approaches, such as the Teradyne-based <ref> [37] </ref> system demonstrated in Section 6, merely compared stuck-at signatures to the observed behavior, and implicated the (single) nodes that most closely matched. A novel approach was presented by Millman, McCluskey, and Acken [33], in which pseudo-signatures for bridging faults were constructed from stuck-at signatures for the bridged nodes. <p> No Sim and Sim indicate that match restriction was applied without and with logic simulation, respectively. 23 6 Comparison to another approach In order to compare the improved results to standard diagnosis methods, this section presents an experiment modeled after the Teradyne fault diagnosis system <ref> [37] </ref>. The fault ordering method penalizes candidate stuck-at faults for each predicted failure that did not actually occur and for each failure that occurs without being predicted by the candidate. This procedure produces a ranked list of stuck-at faults.

Reference-contexts: Previous attempts to measure the diagnostic quality of a given test set have usually involved calculations of the number of indistinguishable (bit-wise equivalent) fault signatures <ref> [12, 27, 38, 39] </ref>. A test set for which many faults have identical signatures has poor diagnostic resolution, as the likelihood of a precise diagnosis is small. Conversely, if a test set produces a unique signature for each fault, it is considered to have ideal diagnostic resolution.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, identifying a fault as the cause of a defect has much to do with the relative likelihood of certain defects occurring in the actual 2 circuit. Inductive Fault Analysis <ref> [40] </ref> uses the circuit layout to determine the relative probabilities of individual physical faults in the fabricated circuit.

Reference-contexts: There is also a question of the effectiveness of I DDQ testing and diagnosis given the current trend of generally increasing, and increasingly noisy, background current levels. A proposed solution to this problem is the concept of current signatures <ref> [11, 21, 22, 43] </ref>, which considers differential current levels between tests, rather than absolute values, to infer about the presence and identity of circuit defects. 2.4 Other approaches Several approaches to fault diagnosis are not neatly categorized by the combination of fault model and algorithm specification used above.

Reference-contexts: Both attempt to identify all fault-free lines, and so can implicitly diagnose multiple faults and various fault types, although the resulting diagnoses are often pessimistic and imprecise. Waicukauski and Lindbloom present a technique that incorporates elements of both test-based fault localization and effect-cause analysis <ref> [44] </ref>. The technique relies on a great deal of information: in addition to propagation and sensitization path information, it requires knowledge of internal-node logic values to eliminate candidate nodes. Stuck-at fault simulation is performed, but only for a reduced set of fault candidates.
