Abstract: Typical home comfort systems utilize only rudimentary forms of energy management and conservation. The most sophisticated technology in common use today is an automatic setback thermostat. Tremendous potential remains for improving the efficiency of electric and gas usage. However, home residents who are ignorant of the physics of energy utilization cannot design environmental control strategies, but neither can energy management experts who are ignorant of the behavior patterns of the inhabitants. Adaptive control seems the only alternative. We have begun building an adaptive control system that can infer appropriate rules of operation for home comfort systems based on the lifestyle of the inhabitants and energy conservation goals. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of neural networks for intelligent control. We are constructing a prototype control system in an actual residence using neural network reinforcement learning and prediction techniques. The residence is equipped with sensors to provide information about environmental conditions (e.g., temperatures, ambient lighting level, sound and motion in each room) and actuators to control the gas furnace, electric space heaters, gas hot water heater, lighting, motorized blinds, ceiling fans, and dampers in the heating ducts. This paper presents an overview of the project as it now stands.

Reference-contexts: We have implemented this module for the great room zone (see Figure 1), which has seven independently controlled banks of lights and four light sensor readings <ref> (Dodier, Lukianow, Ries, & Mozer, 1994) </ref>. Each bank of lights can be set to one of 16 possible intensity levels.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, even rudimentary forms of regulation, such as operating a set back thermostat (which allows different temperature settings depending on the time of day), are inordinately difficult for people <ref> (Gregorek, 1991) </ref>. Inhabitants cannot be expected to design efficient control strategies given their ignorance of technology and the physics of energy utilization, but neither can energy management experts who are ignorant of the dynamic behavior patterns of individuals.

Reference-contexts: We have incomplete models of the environment and controlled devices. The environment, including the behavior of the inhabitants, is nonstationary and stochastic. Controlled devices are nonlinear. Multiple interacting devices must be controlled simultaneously. Under such circumstances, traditional techniques from control theory and artificial intelligence have great difficulty <ref> (Dean & Wellman, 1991) </ref>. The basic system architecture of ache is presented in Figure 3. This architecture is replicated for each control domain|lighting, air heating, water heating, and ventilation.

Reference-contexts: If the inhabitants or their preferences change over time, only the setpoint generator need relearn. Both the setpoint generator and device regulator are built as a combination of lookup tables and neural networks, and are trained with Q learning <ref> (Watkins & Dayan, 1992) </ref>, a reinforcement learning technique. 5 Current Implementation Status We are currently implementing various components of ache. We started with the predictors, and are now moving on to control tasks. We summarize several of the current projects here. * Occupancy Predictor.
