Reference-contexts: Some background on these complexity classes can be found in, e.g., [3]. The above-mentioned algorithm uses randomization and non-determinism in this order only. This means that an even stronger statement is true: Hilbert's Nullstellensatz is in AM, the "Arthur-Merlin" class <ref> [2] </ref> (by definition of AM). This result is almost as good as possible since AM is considered to be "just above" NP (see for instance the sequence of inclusions in the abstract). <p> Another question is whether HN 2 coAM. This is quite unlikely since by the NP-hardness of HN, coNP would then be included in AM. It is known <ref> [5, 2] </ref> that coNP AM implies the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy to its second level ( 2 = 2 = AM). There is a more direct proof that HN 2 AM.

This opens up applications in, e.g., geometric theorem proving and robot motion planning <ref> [6] </ref>. Note also that if the f i 's can have arbitrary complex coefficients, HN is the canonical NP-complete problem in the Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation [4].

Reference-contexts: Here c is a universal constant, deg (Q i ) &lt; n 1 n 2 and N (R) c:N 2d . In fact R depends only on P 1 and P 2 . See <ref> [7, 15] </ref> for proofs of this result. We need a generalization to several polynomials. This is tedious but straightforward.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we use a sparse representation. This means that we do not charge for monomials with a coefficient equal to 0. Sometimes the opposite choice is made (see e.g. <ref> [9, 11] </ref>). With that dense representation, the decision algorithms mentioned above are downsized from PSPACE to LOGSPACE. For univariate systems, there is an equally important representational issue, namely, whether exponents are coded in unary or binary.

Reference-contexts: However, it turns out that the one-sided and two-sided versions of AM are identical ([23], Theorem 2). One can ask whether there is a similar algorithm which always gives the correct answer for unsatisfiable systems, i.e., in the terminology of <ref> [10] </ref>, whether HN has a perfectly sound Arthur-Martin proof system (in the same terminology, the algorithm of Theorem 2 is a perfectly complete Arthur-Martin proof system). This is possible if and only if HN 2 NP since perfectly sound Arthur-Martin proof systems exist only for languages in NP [10]. <p> terminology of <ref> [10] </ref>, whether HN has a perfectly sound Arthur-Martin proof system (in the same terminology, the algorithm of Theorem 2 is a perfectly complete Arthur-Martin proof system).

Reference-contexts: It is shown in <ref> [12] </ref> that one can take D i = maxf3; dg n . This leads to a s O (1) d O (n 2 ) L bound on the size a. This bound was improved to d O (n) s (log s + L) in [13].

This bound was improved to d O (n) s (log s + L) in <ref> [13] </ref>. Theorem 5 follows easily (one could also use the simpler d O (n 2 ) bound).

Reference-contexts: The following bound is due to Adleman and Odlyzko ([1], proof of Lemma 3); see also [22]. 11 Theorem 9 jS (x)j = O (x 1=2 log (x n )): This result relies on GRH through an effective version of the Chebotarev density theorem <ref> [14] </ref> (in fact, only the effective prime ideal theorem is used). A bound on f (x) follows easily. Corollary 1 There exists an absolute constant c such that: f (x) n Proof. By Theorem 9, X 0 X 0 for some universal constant c.

Reference-contexts: The primitive element r is a root of R. So B is an irreducible factor of R. The stated bounds follow from Lemma 3. Indeed, steps 1 and 3 are very cheap compared to step 2. This follows from the bound on polynomial factors in <ref> [16] </ref>. 2 4 Solutions modulo p One can take care easily of unsatisfiable systems with the effective Hilbert Nullstellensatz.

Reference-contexts: This oracle decides, given an integer p, whether p is prime and S is satisfiable modulo p. The first task is feasible since the set of prime numbers is known to be in NP <ref> [17] </ref>, and for the second one we just have to guess a solution. 4 In fact, we do not need exact counting since there is a large gap between A and B.

Reference-contexts: An instance is positive if C outputs a non-zero value on input x. This problem occurs in the simulation of Random Access Machines on Turing machines <ref> [18] </ref>. It is well-known that ACVP is in BPP; however, this problem is not known to be in NP. It is not hard to see that ACVP is polynomial-time many-one reducible to HN.

Reference-contexts: n gives the desired result since in this case there are 2 n factors in (9). (Each factor d (N ) gives at least one distinct prime factor since d (N ) 2 by property 2.) 2 The motivation for this lemma came from a conjecture of Shub and Smale <ref> [19] </ref> on the length of computations for k!. The "naive" method for computing k! requires fi (k log k) operations (additions and multiplications; subtractions are also allowed).

Reference-contexts: Proof. As mentioned before, the second part of the claim follows from AM 2 . However, for the clarity of exposition, we will show first that HN 2 2 . Stockmeyer's result is based on a lemma of Sipser <ref> [20] </ref> on universal hashing: there exists a 2 predicate Hash (E; m) which has the following property. If a set E f0; 1g k has at most 2 m2 elements then Hash (E; m) is true; but if jEj m2 m , Hash (E; m) is false. <p> It follows from the analysis above that this randomized algorithm always gives a correct answer for satisfiable systems. On the other hand, Sipser's lemma <ref> [20] </ref> states that, if jEj 2 m2 and A 1 ; : : : ; A m are chosen at random, the probability of collision 5 is at most 1/2 ("collision" meaning that C (f 1 ; : : : ; f m ) is true).

Reference-contexts: Stockmeyer <ref> [21] </ref> has shown that approximate counting can be performed in the polynomial hierarchy (in 3 ), and this result relativizes to an arbitrary oracle. Hence HN is in the polynomial hierarchy. By taking a closer look at Stockmeyer's argument, one can prove the following result.

Reference-contexts: Let S (x) = P 0 px (1W (p)) where 0 denotes summation on those primes p which do not divide . The following bound is due to Adleman and Odlyzko ([1], proof of Lemma 3); see also <ref> [22] </ref>. 11 Theorem 9 jS (x)j = O (x 1=2 log (x n )): This result relies on GRH through an effective version of the Chebotarev density theorem [14] (in fact, only the effective prime ideal theorem is used). A bound on f (x) follows easily.
