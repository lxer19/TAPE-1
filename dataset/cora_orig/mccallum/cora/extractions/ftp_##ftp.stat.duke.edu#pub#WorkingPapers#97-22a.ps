Abstract: This report describes statistical research and development work on hospital quality monitor data sets from the nationwide VA hospital system. The project covers statistical analysis, exploration and modelling of data from several quality monitors, with the primary goals of: (a) understanding patterns of variability over time in hospital-level and monitor area specific quality monitor measures, and (b) understanding patterns of dependencies between sets of monitors. We present discussion of basic perspectives on data structure and preliminary data exploration for three monitors, followed by developments of several classes of formal models. We identify classes of hierarchical random effects time series models to be of relevance in mod-elling single or multiple monitor time series. We summarise basic model features and results of analyses of the three monitor data sets, in both single and multiple monitor frameworks, and present a variety of summary inferences in graphical displays. Our discussion includes summary conclusions related to the two key goals, discussions of questions of comparisons across hospitals, and some recommendations about further potential substantive and statistical investigations.

Reference-contexts: These authors have developed a variety of Bayesian hierarchical models for the observed outcomes, including regressions on the DRG predictor and hospital-specific parameters drawn from a hospital population prior <ref> (Burgess et al 1996, Christiansen and Morris 1997) </ref>. These are customised versions of standard random effects generalised linear models with Bayesian interpretations and motivations.

Reference-contexts: In cases where n i is large and p i is small, appeal to Poisson approximations to the binomial sampling model leads M&C to the class of PRIMM regression models in which z i is conditionally Poisson with mean n i <ref> (Christiansen and Morris 1997) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Our analyses are implemented in Fortran programs developed specifically for these models and this project and including both multiple and single monitor models. Reported analyses in the exploratory MODEL-1 framework were independently performed using the Bayesian software package BUGS <ref> (Spiegelhalter et al 1995) </ref> as well as our custom programs. Repeating analyses using different software provides opportunity to assess the relative accuracy of the numerical approximations to posterior distributions. Our reported summaries of analyses of the single monitor series have been so validated.
