Abstract: The algorithm described in this paper discovers one or more motifs in a collection of DNA or protein sequences by using the technique of expectation maximization to fit a two-component finite mixture model to the set of sequences. Multiple motifs are found by fitting a mixture model to the data, probabilistically erasing the occurrences of the motif thus found, and repeating the process to find successive motifs. The algorithm requires only a set of unaligned sequences and a number specifying the width of the motifs as input. It returns a model of each motif and a threshold which together can be used as a Bayes-optimal classifier for searching for occurrences of the motif in other databases. The algorithm estimates how many times each motif occurs in each sequence in the dataset and outputs an alignment of the occurrences of the motif. The algorithm is capable of discovering several different motifs with differing numbers of occurrences in a single dataset.

Reference-contexts: The MM algorithm has been implemented as an option to the MEME software for discovering multiple motifs in biopolymer sequences <ref> (Bailey & Elkan 1993) </ref>. MM can therefore be used to discover multiple motifs in a dataset. Briefly, this is done by repeatedly applying MM to the dataset and then probabilistically erasing all occurrences of the discovered motif. <p> The MM algorithm is implemented as an option to the MEME software for discovering multiple motifs in biopolymer sequences <ref> (Bailey & Elkan 1993) </ref>. The version of MEME which uses MM will be be referred to as MEME+. MEME+ searches for the best starting point for MM by trying values of (0) between p 1=(2W ) and values of (0) which are derived from subsequences in the dataset. <p> These starting positions agreed with the results of earlier sequence analysis work (Boguski et al. 1992), (Boguski, Murray, & Powers 1992). The three DNA datasets, crp, lexa and crplexa, are described in <ref> (Bailey & Elkan 1993) </ref> and were used to test MEME there. They contain DNA sequences from E. coli. The crp dataset contains known binding sites for CRP (Lawrence & Reilly 1990), and a few sites which have been identified by similarity to the known motif.

Reference-contexts: as an estimate of the prob ability that position j in sequence Y i is the start of an occurrence of the motif just discovered, e (1) estimate of the probability that the position is not contained in an occurrence of any motif found by the algorithm so far. (See <ref> (Bailey & Elkan 1994) </ref> for the details of MEME+ and the heuristics it uses.) The output of MEME+ includes a log-odds matrix spec and a threshold value t for each motif found. Together these form a Bayes-optimal classifier (Duda & Hart 1973) for the "zero-one" loss function.

Reference-contexts: IRI-9110813. Fitting the model to the dataset includes estimating the relative frequency of motif occurrences. This estimated frequency determines the threshold for a Bayes-optimal classifier that can be used to find occurrences of the motif in other databases. The motifs found by MM resemble profiles without gaps <ref> (Gribskov, Luthy, & Eisenberg 1990) </ref>. The MM algorithm is an extension of the expectation maximization technique for fitting finite mixture models developed by Aitkin & Rubin (1985).

Reference-contexts: One contains three known motifs, each of which occurs multiple times per sequence. And one contains two motifs, each of which occurs in only about half of the sequences. The protein datasets, lipocalin, hth, and farn, are described in <ref> (Lawrence et al. 1993) </ref> and were used to test the Gibbs sampling algorithm described there. We reiterate briefly here. The lipocalin proteins bind small, hydrophobic ligands for a wide range of biological purposes. The dataset contains the five most divergent lipocalins with known 3D structure.
