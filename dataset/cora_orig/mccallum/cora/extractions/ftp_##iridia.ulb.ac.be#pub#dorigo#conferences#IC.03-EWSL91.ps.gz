Abstract: This paper considers some issues related to the apportionment of credit problem in Genetic Based Machine Learning systems (GBML). A GBML system is composed of three major subsystems. The first one, the performance subsystem, is a parallel adaptive rule-based system where the knowledge base is a set of rules expressed in a low-level syntax. The second subsystem, called Genetic Algorithm (GA), is a procedure that searches in the rule space by means of genetic operators modelled according to natural genetic operators (e.g. reproduction, crossover, mutation). The third subsystem faces the apportionment of credit problem, i.e. how to evaluate the quality of existing rules. In this paper we propose an apportionment of credit algorithm, called Message-Based Bucket Brigade, in which messages instead of rules are evaluated. A rule quality is then a function of the value of the messages matching the rule conditions, of the rule conditions specificity and of the value of the message the rule tries to post. This approach gives a solution to the default hierarchy formation problem, i.e. the problem of creating set of rules in which default rules cover broad categories of system responses, while specific ones cover situations in which default rules are incorrect. A comparison with other approaches to default hierarchy formation is presented. The final section presents conclusions and suggests directions for further research.

Reference-contexts: of n positions; every position is called gene a gene can assume a value, called allelic value, belonging to an alphabet that is usually A=-0,1,*- (the reasons underlying this choice are to be found in the rule discovery algorithm used, namely the Genetic Algorithm; in fact it has been demonstrated <ref> (Holland,1975) </ref> that the lower the cardinality of the alphabet, the higher the efficiency of the algorithm in processing useful information contained in the structure of the chromosomes) Consider for example the following classifier * 1 * ; 0 1 1 fi 0 1 0 here the second condition is matched only

Reference-contexts: Default hierarchies have some nice properties. They can be used to build quasi-homomorphic 2 models of the environment which generally require far fewer rules than equivalent homomorphic ones <ref> (Riolo,1987) </ref>. Moreover their performance can be improved adding more exceptions and the whole system can learn gracefully, i.e. the performance of the system is not too strongly influenced by the insertion of new rules. An example of default hierarchy is given in figure 3.
