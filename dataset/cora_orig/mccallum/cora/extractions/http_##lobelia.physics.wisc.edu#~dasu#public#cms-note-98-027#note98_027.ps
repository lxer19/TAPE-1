Abstract: CMS level-1 calorimeter trigger simulation results are discussed. The simulation results are obtained using CMSIM version 111 program based on the GEANT simulation of the detector. These CMSIM results compare favorably to the results from our fast simulation program used in earlier studies. Both these results indicate that the rate requirements of the data acquisition system can be met with a reasonable safety factor of three while providing high efficiencies for high E T physics processes of interest to CMS.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The CMS <ref> [1] </ref> level-1 calorimeter trigger algorithms [2] and the conceptual design [3] are based on a fast simulation program [4, 5, 6, 7]. Some aspects of these results have been verified using detailed simulation [8]. <p> In order to provide a safety factor we require that the total calculated CMS trigger rate be limited to 30 kHz and the calorimeter portion of it to 15 kHz. For efficiency studies, we only select the physics processes amongst those considered in the CMS Technical Proposal <ref> [1] </ref> that place most stringent requirements on the trigger system, i.e., the lowest masses of interest to CMS and channels involving least number of trigger particles. When evaluating efficiencies, we do not include any effects of offline reconstruction inefficiencies or cuts. Therefore, these results are conservative.

We then explore the efficiencies of triggering on various high p T physics processes. The CMS data acquisition system is expected to handle 100 kHz input rate. <p> At low luminosity we prioritize the total and missing E T and jet+electron triggers over the jet triggers. These E T cutoffs were selected in an earlier FASTSIM based study <ref> [7] </ref>, with rates totalling 15 kHz. That run of the FASTSIM used different set of PYTHIA events and an older version of the electron/photon trigger algorithm. We do not retune the E T cutoffs to obtain the 15 kHz target rate.
