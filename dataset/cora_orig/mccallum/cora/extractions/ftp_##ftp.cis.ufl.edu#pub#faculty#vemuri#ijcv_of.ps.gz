Abstract: In this paper, we present two very efficient and accurate algorithms for computing optical flow. The first is a modified gradient-based regularization method, and the other is an SSD-based regularization method. For the gradient-based method, to amend the errors in the discrete image flow equation caused by numerical differentiation as well as temporal and spatial aliasing in the brightness function, we propose to selectively combine the image flow constraint and a contour-based flow constraint into the data constraint by using a reliability measure. Each data constraint is appropriately normalized to obtain an approximate minimum distance (of the data point to the linear flow equation) constraint instead of the conventional linear flow constraint. These modifications lead to robust and accurate optical flow estimation. We propose an incomplete Cholesky preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm to solve the resulting large and sparse linear system efficiently. Our SSD-based regularization method uses a normalized SSD measure (based on a similar reasoning as in the gradient-based scheme) as the data constraint in a regularization framework. The nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm in conjunction with an incomplete Cholesky preconditioning is developed to solve the resulting nonlinear minimization problem. Experimental results on synthetic and real image sequences for these two algorithms are given to demonstrate their performance in comparison with competing methods reported in literature.

Reference-contexts: In recent years, many techniques for the computation of optical flow have been proposed in literature. These can be classified into gradient-based, correlation-based, energy-based, and phase-based methods <ref> (Barron et al. 1994) </ref>. The gradient-based approach is dependent on the image flow constraint equation, which is derived from the brightness constancy assumption 2 Lai and Vemuri as well as the first-order Taylor series approximation (Horn and Schunck 1981). <p> Comparisons of our results with the previously reported results (Barron et al. 1994, Szeliski and Coughlan 1994, Weber and Malik 1995, Ju et al. 1996) are made to demonstrate the performance of our algorithms described in earlier sections. The angular error measure <ref> (Barron et al. 1994) </ref> between the computed optical flow and the true flow is adopted in the experiments as a basis for comparison with the previously reported results. <p> The under lying motion in this example is a bilinear expansion from the center of the image. The error in the computed optical flow after 50 iterations of the incomplete Cholesky preconditioned CG algorithm is presented in Table 5, along with results from other gradient-based methods in literature <ref> (Barron et al. 1994, Weber and Malik 1995) </ref>. Once again, our modified gradient-based regularization method produces 100% flow estimates and the result compares favorably to the best existing methods which produce dense as well as sparse flow estimates. The computed optical flow is shown in Fig. 5 (b). <p> et al. 4:64 ffi 3:48 ffi 100% Lucas & Kanade ( 2 1:0) 1:94 ffi 2:06 ffi 48:2% Weber & Malik 3:18 ffi 2:50 ffi 88:6% Lai & Vemuri (Gradient-based) 1:32 ffi 1:04 ffi 100% We also tested our modified gradient-based algorithm on the more complex Yosemite image se quence <ref> (Barron et al. 1994) </ref>. The result of our modified gradient-based method on this example is compared with other gradient-based methods reported in literature (Barron et al. 1994, Weber and Malik 1995, Ju et al. 1996) in Table 5. <p> We developed a fast numerical algorithm that is based on the incomplete Cholesky preconditioned conjugate gradient for solving the linear system associated with this modified gradient-based method. The flow estimates obtained using our method are more accurate than those obtained from other gradient-based techniques reported in literature <ref> (Barron et al. 1994) </ref>. Our SSD-based regularization method uses a normalized SSD measure as the data constraint in a regularization framework. The resulting energy function is neither quadratic nor convex. The nonlinear conjugate gradient in conjunction with an incomplete Cholesky preconditioning was developed to minimize this energy function.

Reference-contexts: However, the SSD-based regularization method requires more computational effort to minimize the energy function. The total energy function in equation 20 is a nonlinear function with a large number of variables. We use the nonlinear conjugate gradient method <ref> (Gill et al. 1981) </ref> with the incomplete Cholesky preconditioning to efficiently minimize this nonlinear energy function in equation 20. The nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm is very efficient in the unconstrained optimization of large-scale nonlinear functions (Gill et al. 1981). <p> We use the nonlinear conjugate gradient method <ref> (Gill et al. 1981) </ref> with the incomplete Cholesky preconditioning to efficiently minimize this nonlinear energy function in equation 20. The nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm is very efficient in the unconstrained optimization of large-scale nonlinear functions (Gill et al. 1981). Although this algorithm can only find the local minima, we can obtain very accurate solution when the initial solution is close to the true solution. For example, small displacement between consecutive frames can be easily found when we start the nonlinear CG from zero initial values. <p> With this preconditioning, the convergence of the nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm can be speeded up dramatically. 3.1. Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Algorithm The nonlinear conjugate gradient method for minimizing general nonlinear functions is outlined as follows <ref> (Gill et al. 1981) </ref>: 1. d 0 = r 0 = f 0 (u 0 ). 2. <p> The first is Fletcher-Reeves formula and the other is the Polak-Ribiere formula <ref> (Gill et al. 1981) </ref>. We adopt the latter since it usually converges much more quickly, although the nonlinear CG needs to restart when fi = 0.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, the values of S x;i and S y;i are set to zeros when the contour flow constraint is not used at the i-th location. To solve this linear system for optical flow es timation, we use the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm <ref> (Golub and Van Loan 1989) </ref> with an incomplete Cholesky preconditioner P (Meijerink and van der Vorst 1977, Elman 1986), given in the following. 1. Initialize u 0 ; compute r 0 = b Ku 0 ; k = 0. 2. <p> Thus, the solution to the auxiliary linear system Pz = r in the preconditioning step of the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm can be obtained via forward and backward substitutions very efficiently. Furthermore, we use the block version <ref> (Golub and Van Loan 1989) </ref> of the incomplete Cholesky factorization to take advantage of the 2 fi 2 block structure of the matrix K. <p> How ever, it is not known if this variant of Jacobi iteration can converge to the unique (true) solution. In addition, Jacobi iteration has been recognized to be less efficient than gradient-type algorithms for solving the linear system with an SPD matrix <ref> (Golub and Van Loan 1989) </ref>. Our incomplete Cholesky preconditioned CG is guaranteed to converge to the true solution for a linear system with an SPD matrix (Golub and Van Loan 1989), which is exactly the type of the linear system for the optical flow computation problem. <p> In addition, Jacobi iteration has been recognized to be less efficient than gradient-type algorithms for solving the linear system with an SPD matrix <ref> (Golub and Van Loan 1989) </ref>.

In addition, the proposed incomplete Cholesky preconditioner approximates the stiffness matrix by taking advantage of its special sparse structure as discussed in section 2.4.

Reference-contexts: To efficiently solve the resulting large and sparse linear system, we employ an incomplete Cholesky preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm, which exploits the special structure of the stiffness matrix for the optical flow problem. 2.1.

Reference-contexts: These can be classified into gradient-based, correlation-based, energy-based, and phase-based methods (Barron et al. 1994). The gradient-based approach is dependent on the image flow constraint equation, which is derived from the brightness constancy assumption 2 Lai and Vemuri as well as the first-order Taylor series approximation <ref> (Horn and Schunck 1981) </ref>. Using the image flow constraint equation alone is insufficient to compute the optical flow since each equation involves two different variables. Horn and Schunck (1981) introduced a first order smoothness measure to constraint the flow field and solve for the flow. <p> Note that the stiffness matrix K in the linear system to be solved is symmetric positive definite (SPD) due to the fact that the energy function to be minimized is quadratic and convex. In <ref> (Horn and Schunck 1981) </ref>, a variant of Jacobi iteration that is based on splitting the stiffness matrix K, a 2 fi 2 block matrix, into a diagonal block matrix and an off-diagonal block matrix was proposed to solve the linear system of the optical flow computation problem.

Reference-contexts: However, our proposed algorithms can be easily modified to deal with multiple motions by changing the L 2 norm in the smoothness constraint to the L 1 norm, which has been shown to allow for discontinuities in the estimated function <ref> (Kumar et al. 1996, Rudin et al. 1993) </ref>. The above mentioned image flow constraint is unreliable at the locations where the brightness function contains large nonlinear components. These locations usually occur in the neighborhood of discontinuities of the brightness function.

Reference-contexts: Since the smoothness constraint is invalid across the motion boundary, Nagel and Enkel-mann (1986) proposed the "oriented smoothness" measure to suppress the smoothness constraint in the direction orthogonal to the boundaries. However, the smoothness across motion boundaries problem can be resolved by using the regularization with discontinuities <ref> (Terzopoulos 1986) </ref>. The variation of an intensity function with time may be caused by geometric or photometric changes.
