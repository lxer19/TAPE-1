Title: Mid-Level Networks Potential Technical Services Status of  
Keyword: (OPstat), User Connectivity Problems (UCP) and Network Joint Management (NJM) working groups.  
Date: December 1991  
Note: Vikas Aggarwal Request for Comments: 1291 JvNCnet Computer Network  this Memo This FYI RFC provides information for the Internet community. It does not specify an Internet standard. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. A large portion of the ideas stem from discussions at the IETF Operational Statistics  
Abstract: This document proposes a set of technical services that each Internet mid-level network can offer within the mid-level network itself and and to its peer networks. The term "mid-level" is used as a generic term to represent all regional and similar networks, which, due to continuous evolutions and transitions, can no longer be termed `regional'. [MAN]. It discusses the pros and cons of offering these services, as well as areas in which mid-level networks can work together.

Reference-contexts: Network Information services (NIC) also make the network easier and more attractive to end users. Examples of these services are: * provide information resources security advisory messages list of library catalogs <ref> [GL91] </ref> geographical information servers password generators * resolve end user problems (user support) These services are NIC related and discussed in detail elsewhere [SSM91].

Reference-contexts: Proper location of secondary nameservers so that they are located on different physical networks can increase the reliability of this service to a large extent <ref> [MOC87a, MOC87b] </ref>. However, the nature of the service requires that the nameservers for the next highest level be available in order to resolve names outside of one's domain. Thus, for `foo.princeton.edu' to resolve `a.mid.net', the root nameservers which point to mid.net's nameservers have to be reachable.

Reference-contexts: It is proposed that at least one stratum-1 and two stratum-2 servers be located within a mid-level network (the selection of three servers is based on the NTP standards documentation <ref> [MIL89] </ref>). Note that the servers can be located at any of the directly connected sites in the network as long as they are publicly accessible. All sites connected to the mid-level network can then coordinate their system times with the servers within the mid-level network itself.

Reference-contexts: Recently however, a number of methods for resource discovery have been devel oped and are available on the Internet (`ftp-list' file compiled by John Granose-odin@pilot.njin.net, Archie at archie.cs.mcgill.ca and Prospero <ref> [NEU] </ref>). It is desirable that the mid-level networks be able to provide up-to-date pointers to the distribution hosts for available public software archives. Coordinating the distribution of a static list is difficult (though not impossible) and the use of automated resource discovery mechanisms such as Archie and Prospero is recommended.

Reference-contexts: Some attempt has been made at documenting such resources <ref> [NNS] </ref> and a mid-level network can be the initial point of contact for distribution of such information on a wide basis. The information can be disseminated in a more controlled and complete manner using this hierarchical approach if each mid-level network maintains up-to-date information about its directly connected sites.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, due to the size and nature of the network, the trend has been to decentralize as many network functions (such as domain name-service, whois, etc.) as possible. Efforts are being made in resource discovery <ref> [SHHH90] </ref> so that the work of researchers is not lost in the volumes of data that is available on the Internet. A side result of this growth has been the logical structure imposed in the Internet of networks classified by function. <p> Public shareware is a very valuable resource within the Internet and a considerable amount of effort is being put into developing applications to track all available resources in the public archives <ref> [SHHH90] </ref>. It would be difficult, if not impossible to create an up-to-date repository for every public domain package available on the Internet, simply because of the volume of software and the rate at which new software is being developed every day.
