Abstract: The unstart transient of a High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) mixed compression axisymmetric inlet at Mach 2 and 2 ffi angle of attack was investigated numerically by using a 3D time accurate Navier-Stokes solver. The Baldwin-Lomax algebraic turbulence model and an extrapolation uniform mass bleed boundary condition for the slot bleed were employed. It is observed that, when an angle of attack is imposed, the flow on the leeward side has a stronger compression than that at zero angle of attack. The strong compression reduces the Mach number upstream of the terminal shock and therefore makes the shock move upstream first on the leeward side. The initial shock motion starts with the bifurcation of the terminal shock. The lower part of the split shock is stable due to the centerbody bleed while the top part of the shock continues to travel upstream. When the terminal shock on the leeward side passes the bleed region, a separation is induced by the shock/boundary layer interac

Reference-contexts: These studies made contributions from different aspects to investigate the high speed inlet unstart transient at zero angle of attack. No numerical studies have been reported on high speed axisymmetric inlet unstart transient due to changes in the angle of attack. Zha et al. <ref> [10] </ref> accurately predicted the unstart angle of attack of a HSCT axisymmetric inlet with a 3D Navier-Stokes solver. Kawamura et al.[11] also simulated 3D axisymmetric HSCT inlet flow at angle of attack. However, the computations in these two studies were all for steady state flows. <p> The Reynolds-averaged 3D compressible time dependent Navier-Stokes equations were solved. The Baldwin-Lomax algebraic turbulence model was used to simulate turbulence. This turbulence model works well to predict the steady state results for the inlet flows <ref> [10] </ref>. We continue to use this model here for its efficiency and fairly good accuracy performance. Since the Roe scheme failed in 3D flow due to an anomalous solution [18], the Van Leer upwind scheme was used in our computation to evaluate the inviscid fluxes. <p> At the subsonic outflow, the constant back pressure boundary condition was used and all other variables were first order extrapolated. The bleed boundary condition was first order extrapolation for all the variables except for the normal velocity which was determined based on uniform bleed mass flowrate <ref> [10] </ref>. This boundary condition, similar to the BC type 5 suggested by Chyu et at. [19], was proven to be a reasonable approximation to the slot bleed used in the experiment [10]. 4.3 Mesh The mesh size of 201x81x31 in streamwise, circumferential and radial direction respectively was used for the present <p> extrapolation for all the variables except for the normal velocity which was determined based on uniform bleed mass flowrate <ref> [10] </ref>.

This mesh size was found to be necessary to 3 resolve the wall boundary layer and shock pro-file to obtain the accurate quantitative results for the steady state solutions <ref> [10] </ref>. Specifically, an axisymmetric grid refinement study was performed at zero angle of attack [10] using two different grids 201x81 and 401x161. The resultant flowfields were essentially identical (e.g., the back pressure for critical operation differed by only 0.17%). <p> This mesh size was found to be necessary to 3 resolve the wall boundary layer and shock pro-file to obtain the accurate quantitative results for the steady state solutions <ref> [10] </ref>.

We therefore adopted the mesh size of 201x81 on the streamwise planes for the time accurate computation in the present study. The circumferential mesh size of 31 is considered as sufficient <ref> [10] </ref>. Certainly, the time accurate computation with this mesh size was CPU intensive. <p> The detailed procedure to compute the steady state solution is given in <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> The absence of the support struts has little influence of the shock position under the experimental back pressure <ref> [10] </ref>, and therefore has little effect on the inlet unstart transient studied in this paper. Fig. 4 presents the transient Mach number contours on the leeward and windward plane from the initial solution at zero angle of attack to the inlet unstart at 2 ffi angle of attack. <p> The separation region then rapidly spreads cir-cumferentially and causes the entire inlet unstart as shown in Fig. 4 c. Fig. 4 c displays the shock system which is in the state just before it reaches the full unstart as shown in <ref> [10] </ref>. Fig. 4 c also indicates that the oblique shock from the leading edge of the centerbody is little influenced by the downstream shock motion due to the predominantly supersonic characteristics of the flow field in that portion. <p> It therefore needs to run very long time to achieve the steady state solution. Usually an uncertainty range needs to be accepted to avoid the lengthy computation <ref> [10] </ref>. Fig. 8 is the wall pressure distributions on the leeward and windward planes at time level 0:88t c . On most part of the forward centerbody from the leading edge to x=R c 1:4, the circumferential pressure gradient direction on the wall is from leeward side to windward side.

Reference-contexts: Kawamura et al.[11] also simulated 3D axisymmetric HSCT inlet flow at angle of attack. However, the computations in these two studies were all for steady state flows. Outside of the CFD work, it must be mentioned that Choby <ref> [12] </ref> was one of the earliest experimental investigators to study the mechanism of inlet unstart for a mixed compression axisymmetric inlet at angle of attack. He first observed the overcompression on the leeward side due to the angle of attack which caused the inlet un-start. <p> At this point before we further analyze the computational results, we list the experimental observations by Choby <ref> [12] </ref> in order to compare with the computation. The experimental Mach 4 number and angle of attack were 2.5 and 2:7 ffi , re-spectively. The experimental geometry was similar to our present one. <p> It means that the flow on the windward side is less compressed and the flow on the leeward side is more compressed (overcompression <ref> [12] </ref>) compared with the case at zero angle of attack. The geometric throat is located at X=R c =2.7836 and is downstream of the bleed region where the terminal shock stands. <p> However, the pressure gradient on the wall reverses the direction when it is close to the cowl leading edge (cowl leading edge is located at X=R c = 2.0) with the flow compressed more strongly on the leeward side. This is again the so called overcompression observed by Choby <ref> [12] </ref> in his experiment. Above phenomenon can also be seen from Fig. 9 which presents the pressure contours in circumferential direction at two streamwise locations at time level 0:88t c .

Reference-contexts: Understanding of the physical phenomena of the un-start transient for axisymmetric HSCT inlet is very important to guide the HSCT inlet design and control to obtain high efficiency and wide stability margin <ref> [13] </ref>. The tolerance of angle of attack is a more challenging issue in the design of an axisymmetric HSCT inlet compared to a rectangular inlet.

It indicates that the computed shock location and intensity agree well with the experiment under the experimental back pressure.

Reference-contexts: This phenomenon agrees with the conical flow field analysis <ref> [20] </ref>. From Fig. 4 b, it is seen that, with angle of attack, the terminal shock on the leeward side moves upstream first. The windward side shock moves downstream slightly and is in a more stable position. <p> On most part of the forward centerbody from the leading edge to x=R c 1:4, the circumferential pressure gradient direction on the wall is from leeward side to windward side. This also agrees with the conical flow at angle of attack <ref> [20] </ref>. However, the pressure gradient on the wall reverses the direction when it is close to the cowl leading edge (cowl leading edge is located at X=R c = 2.0) with the flow compressed more strongly on the leeward side.

Reference-contexts: The center-body bleed stabilizes the lower part of the shock, while the top part of the shock moves in the absence of cowl bleed. The lower part of the bifurcated shock is also likely induced by the bleed process itself. According to Shih et al. <ref> [21] </ref>, the bleed hole induces a so called " barrier shock" which is very similar to the lower part of the bifurcated shock. But the geometry and its scale in Shih's study were different. Their bleed hole had a thick non-dimensional wall and different diameter.
