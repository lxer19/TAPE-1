Reference-contexts: In recent years, several knowledge-based systems were introduced to support health care providers (mainly clinicians) with the monitoring of critical care patients and to assist them with diagnostic decisions and therapy planning <ref> [1] </ref>. These systems range from simple intelligent alarms to sophisticated systems for anesthesia monitoring or ventilator management ( e . g . , G U A R D I A N [ 2 ] , S I M O N [ 3 ] , NEOGANESH/GANESH [4], and VIE-VENT [5, 6]).

A different view of automated support of health care is the critiquing approach: the program critiques the physician's plan rather than recommending a complete one of its own [13].

Reference-contexts: Pregnant women who have never had diabetes before but who have a high blood glucose level (carbohydrate intolerance) during pregnancy are said to have GDM. GDM affects about 3 percent of all pregnant women, i.e., about 100,000 cases in the United States each year <ref> [7] </ref>. An appropriate controlled observation and treatment of GDM may reduce the risks for several adverse perinatal outcomes including excessive fetal growth, birth trauma, fetal death, neonatal morbidity, hypoglycemia, or hyperbiliru-binemia.

Reference-contexts: The "Sweet Success" California Diabetes and Pregnancy Program (CDAPP) One aim of our approach is to identify the needs and demands of patients who use the system. A cooperation with the leading members of the "Sweet Success" California Diabetes and Pregnancy Program (CDAPP) at Stanford University Medical Center <ref> [8] </ref> accomplished our aim. We participated in medical consulting meetings including patients and acquired the necessary knowledge to structure the knowledge base and the graphical user interface. We developed mockups of the Patient Advocates user interface. Discussing the mockups clarifies the Patient Advocate's input and output and its basic functionality.

Reference-contexts: We developed mockups of the Patient Advocates user interface. Discussing the mockups clarifies the Patient Advocate's input and output and its basic functionality. Additionally, the care protocols developed by the CDAPP and a protocol and intention-oriented language <ref> [9] </ref> provide the basis to proceed with our approach in the absence of functional dependencies. 3 A PROTOTYPE In the current phase of the Patient Advocate project we are working on a prototype to implement an intelligent assistant performing the monitoring and consultation regarding the patients' health conditions (issue (1) of <p> The straightforward expert system technology is too narrow [12]. The Patient Advocate is an intelligent assistant, which is able to cope with vague, illstruc-tured, and incomplete problem definitions. Currently, we are evaluating an intention-based temporal representation of a treatment protocols language <ref> [9] </ref> to overcome the drawbacks of vague problem definitions. The representation of treatment protocols captures their preferences (e.g., utility preferences), their intentions (e.g., overall action pattern), their conditions (e.g., filter condition, suspend condition), their effects, and the durative behaviors of actions (e.g., performing actions in parallel, cyclic actions).
