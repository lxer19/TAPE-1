Abstract: It is a common assumption in evolutionary theory that a parent will distribute its resources evenly between a set of equivalent offspring. However this paper presents a theoretical model in which uneven parental investment between a set of equivalent offspring can be a preferred evolutionary strategy to equal investment in the same set of offspring. This effect does not depend on different offspring having different survival probabilities. It is further shown that this same behavior could still arise when changes in the size of each clutch of offspring are taken into account.

Reference-contexts: The reasoning given in the original argument for even investment <ref> (Dawkins 1976) </ref> is to assume that as the relatedness of the parent to all the siblings is equal, then the investment must be equal. <p> To attempt a full mathematical analysis of this would be too far from the main objective of this paper, and so these considerations are not incorporated into the model. Also a fuller model would consider the value of investing in siblings and grandchildren rather than directly in children. Dawkins <ref> (Dawkins 1976) </ref> has suggested a generalized measure of "altruism investment" to take this into account. Development of that would take us down a long and interesting road, so again this is deferred to future work. 5 Summary and open problems.

Reference-contexts: For high clutch sizes investment will be spread too thinly. A discussion of other aspects of this, including some comments on real-world observations can be found in two excellent papers by Douglas Morris <ref> (Morris 1985, Morris 1987) </ref>. 4.3 Whole-lifetime analysis. The analysis above has concentrated on a single "breeding season".

Reference-contexts: How could uneven investment arise? It would be necessary for the parent to be able to individuate between the individual offspring who are to be treated in different ways. This could be by some direct ability to individuate the offspring, as is known to exist in a certain species <ref> (Pfenning and Sherman 1995) </ref> or it could be by a less direct method such as by offspring size. 7 4.5 The error in the original argument. <p> Is the always the best uneven strategy?? Is there a canonical "topology" to the distribution of investment regardless of the exact "geometric" shape of the investment-survival graph? This model assumes individual recognition abilities on behalf of the parent <ref> (Pfenning and Sherman 1995) </ref>. If this type of investment model did exist in a real-life species, then it would be interesting to investigate whether the parents individuate their offspring, or whether the offspring are compared in some other way.

Reference-contexts: parent (say the father) makes a minimal, fixed, investment of, say, just a small amount of time and energy in creation of sperm and copulation, and that the remainder of the childrens' upbringing is the responsibility of the other parent|this avoids the complicated issues of parent-offspring conflict as explored in <ref> (Trivers 1974) </ref>. After the end of this phase it is assumed that the parent makes no further investment in the child.
