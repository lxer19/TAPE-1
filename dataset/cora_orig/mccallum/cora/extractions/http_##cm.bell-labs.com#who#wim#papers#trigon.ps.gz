Title: Biorthogonal Smooth Local Trigonometric Bases  
Author: Bjorn Jawerth Wim Sweldens 
Note: AMS Subject classification. 42A10, 42A16  
Abstract: In this paper we discuss smooth local trigonometric bases. We present two generalizations of the orthogonal basis of Malvar and Coifman-Meyer: biorthogonal and equal parity bases. These allow natural representations of constant and, sometimes, linear components. We study and compare their approximation properties and applicability in data compression. This is illustrated with numerical examples. Keywords. local trigonometric basis, wavelet, biorthogonality, data compression

In [3], a connection between this basis and the Wilson basis of [9] was pointed out. Smooth local trigonometric bases were used successfully for image compression in <ref> [1, 2, 11] </ref>. The third disadvantage can be resolved by using an adaptive algorithm where the splitting locations are allowed to depend on the function. An algorithm was presented by R. Coifman and V. Wickerhauser in [8, 20]. An improvement was proposed in [10]. <p> Higher order Lipschitz regularity ( &gt; 1) can be defined in a straightforward way by using higher order differences of f . The Fourier transform of a function f 2 L 2 is defined as b f (!) = 1 3 Trigonometric bases Consider the interval I = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for simplicity. The basis functions of a Fourier series are given by e k (x) = exp (i2kx); and we know that the set fe k g is an orthonormal basis for L 2 ([0; 1]). <p> In order to achieve a resolution of the constant and still have an orthogonal basis, the cutoff function needs to be chosen as l ff = l ((x ff)=*), where l (x) = &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; 1 for x &lt; 1 p for x 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref> This cutoff function is continuous but not differentiable. Consequently, the folding operator introduces discontinuities in derivatives that ruin the approximation properties (i.e. ruin the decay given in (1)). What we need is a resolution of the constant with smoother cutoff functions. <p> We call such a folding operator an equal parity folding (EPF) operator. In Section 6 we proved that they are not invertible in L 2 , see Lemma 12. Nevertheless, they have been used successfully for image compression, see <ref> [1] </ref>. In this section, we study their behavior more carefully and try to understand why they sometimes are useful. <p> In other words, the approximation has some smoothness. We note that the idea to switch the two operators around was first suggested in <ref> [1] </ref>. This approach works well as long since the function is smooth at the folding point. This can be understood as follows. <p> The errors are measured with the ` 2 norm. We always use 20 the staggered discretization. The first example involves a function that has discontinuities at the folding points. We work on the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref> where we assume that the functions are extended periodically to the real line. Consider the function f = 2 fl [1=4;3=4) 1; which generates a square wave. We take 1=4 and 3=4 as folding points, each with * = 1=4. <p> It thus uses a (non smooth) local trigonometric basis. One of its disadvantages is that at high compression ratios, the compressed image reveals the splitting location: the so-called blocking effect. This is caused by the fact that the approximations are discontinuous. In <ref> [1, 2] </ref> smooth local trigonometric bases are used for image compression and it is shown that they outperform JPEG. In [11], a comparison between the biorthogonal and the EPF case is made.

Reference-contexts: The convergence will thus be slow and the approximation properties poor. 2. Since each interval is handled separately, the approximations are, in general, discontinuous. 3.

We say that a basis has a resolution of the constant if, on a finite domain, the constant is represented with a finite number of basis functions.

Reference-contexts: It immediately follows that using the smooth local trigonometric basis on these intervals in the frequency domain leads to wavelets with rapid decay in the spatial domain. In case the cutoff functions belong to C 1 , the wavelets have faster than polynomial decay. The Meyer wavelet <ref> [15] </ref> was constructed in this way, and its generalization was one of the motivations for the work of Coifman and Meyer. These wavelets have an infinite number of vanishing moments since their Fourier transform vanishes in a neighborhood of the origin.

Reference-contexts: The transform has to be chosen such that it reflects the correlation present in the image. Since images have both spatial and spectral correlation, the basis functions need to be local in space and frequency. A standard still image compression algorithm is JPEG <ref> [19] </ref>. The image here is divided into blocks of eight by eight pixels, after which the discrete cosine transform is used on each block. It thus uses a (non smooth) local trigonometric basis.

Reference-contexts: More precisely, if f 2 Lip (t ), then c k = O (jkj ); (1) see <ref> [21] </ref>. This property is fundamental. It tells us that if the function is smooth, the convergence will be rapid. By truncating the series we thus obtain accurate approximations.
