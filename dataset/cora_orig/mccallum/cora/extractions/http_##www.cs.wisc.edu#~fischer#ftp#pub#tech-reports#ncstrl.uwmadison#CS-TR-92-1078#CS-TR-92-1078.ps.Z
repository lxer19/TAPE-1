Title: Minimum-Perimeter Domain Decomposition  
Author: Jonathan Yackel Robert R. Meyer 
Abstract: For certain classes of problems defined over two-dimensional regions with grid structure, minimum-perimeter domain decomposition provides tools for partitioning the problem tasks among processors so as to minimize interprocessor communication. Minimizing interprocessor communication is shown to be equivalent to tiling the domain so as to minimize total tile perimeter, where each tile corresponds to the tasks assigned to some processor. The concepts of "slice-convexity" and "semi-perimeter" are introduced to characterize minimum-perimeter tiles. A tight lower bound on the perimeter of a tile as a function of its area is developed. We then show how to generate all possible minimum-perimeter tiles. Certain classes of domains are shown to be optimally tilable.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Many computations performed on parallel processors involve a collection of tasks which are related by a rectangular grid structure (i.e., as in figure 1, each task has at most four "neighbor" tasks). Examples include the problem of determining the characteristics of fluid flow <ref> [5] </ref>, solving obstacle problems using parallel successive overrelaxation [1], and edge detection in computer vision [6] . <p> to tiling is a method of constructing optimal tilings for large domains with complex shapes. 6 Non-uniform Grids D 1 D 2 Under certain assumptions, the tiling approaches discussed above can also be used to deal with non-uniform grids which are important in many applications (see e.g., Gropp and Keyes <ref> [5] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: 2, we show some perimeter-optimal partial squares constructed in this manner with areas ranging from one to sixteen. 6 In x3 of Ghandeharizadeh et al [3], we derived an alternate bound on S: S 2 A 1=2 : This bound is equivalent to S fl (A) (see Yackel and Meyer <ref> [7] </ref>). Table 1 constructed via theorem 4 contains minimum perimeter values for areas up to 56. 3.3 Lower Bound on C Corollary 5 X P fl (A p ) C . <p> So, using the concept of connectedness in the toroidal sense, the closest analogy to the preceding model is obtained by tiling toroidal domains with slice-convex minimum perimeter tiles. Tilings of this form provide optimal solutions to the above database application (see Yackel and Meyer <ref> [7] </ref>). Consider an N fi N toroidal domain, with equal areas assigned to N processors so that A p = N; (p = 1; 2; . . .; N ). Under these constraints it is always possible to tile the domain with minimum-perimeter tiles.
