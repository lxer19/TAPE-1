Abstract: Several authors have described how to construct a mul-tiresolution surface model by adding wavelet coefficients to a base model in arbitrary order. We present a method that allows one to remove detail from a wavelet description, which is important for interactive viewing of multiresolution models.

Reference-contexts: Meyers [3] and Lounsbery [2] showed how the detail contained in a wavelet coefficient can be added into a polygon and a polyhedral surface model, respectively. However, these authors did not present a method for incrementally removing detail to reduce the polygon count. Certain et. al. <ref> [1] </ref> have recently developed a multiresolution surface viewer that stores models at different resolutions and then adds detail starting from the most appropriate stored model. <p> For more detail, see <ref> [2, 1] </ref>. As in the curve case, the reference count of each wavelet vertex is increased. Removing detail is also more complicated for surfaces. Removing the geometry of the wavelet is analogous to the curve case, as is the maintenance of reference counts.

Reference-contexts: Whereas adding or removing detail is usually a discrete event that may cause visible popping, wavelet techniques allow detail to be added or removed in a continuous fashion.

Adding detail. Let's first review how detail is added into a polygon <ref> [3] </ref>. In Figure 1 we have a coarse representation of a piecewise linear polygon, and we are about to add a wavelet centered on the 17 th vertex. First we need to add to the polygon all the wavelet vertices that it does not already have (vertices 12, 14, 17).

Reference-contexts: Introduction. Wavelet analysis has been shown to be an effective method for automatically generating accurate models of geometric models at different levels of resolution <ref> [4] </ref>. An especially attractive feature of wavelet-based models is that the most accurate version of the model already contains all the coarser approximations, so memory is not wasted when storing several models of the same object at different resolutions.
