Title: Recognition Algorithms for the Loom Classifier

Abstract: Most of today's terminological representation systems implement hybrid reasoning architectures wherein a concept classifier is employed to reason about concept definitions, and a separate recog-nizer is invoked to compute instantiation relations between concepts and instances. Whereas most of the existing recognizer algorithms designed to maximally exploit the reasoning supplied by the concept classifier, Loom has experimented with recognition strategies that place less emphasis on the classifier, and rely more on the abilities of Loom's backward chaining query facility. This paper presents the results of experiments that test the performance of the Loom algorithms. These results suggest that, at least for some applications, the Loom approach to recognition is likely to outperform the classical approach. They also indicate that for some applications, much better performance can be achieved by eliminating the recognizer entirely, in favor of a purely backward chaining architecture. We conclude that no single recognition algorithm or strategy is best for all applications, and that an architecture that offers a choice of inference modes is likely to be more useful than one that offers only a single style of reasoning.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Loom (MacGregor and Burstein, 1991; MacGregor, 1991b) belongs to the family of terminological representation systems descended from the language KL-ONE <ref> (Brachman and Schmolze, 1985) </ref>. A characteristic feature of these systems is their ability to reason with definitional and descriptive knowledge.

Reference-contexts: This is discussed in section . Before looking at experiments that compare different recognition algorithms, we first present the results of an experiment performed using a single recognizer (in this case, the recognizer implemented for Loom version 1.4). Figure 1 shows results the using a Loom-based application called DRAMA <ref> (Harp et al., 1991) </ref>. DRAMA is a system that provides intelligent assistance to analysts of logistics databases. The portion of DRAMA that we used in our tests analyzes data for anomolies, such as inconsistencies and noteworthy changes, and logs and categorizes any data anomolies it encounters.

Reference-contexts: Why did we, as Loom implementors, make this change, given that generating new abstractions tends to slow things down? In a Loom-based parsing application <ref> (Kasper, 1989) </ref> we observed that unification operations over the same sets of descriptions were being performed repeatedly during step (ii) of the recognition cycle (see (MacGregor, 1991b) for a discussion of description unification). <p> Some Loom applications, notably, natural language parsing, explicitly depend on this kind of constraint propagation <ref> (Kasper, 1989) </ref>|these applications cannot profit from the accelerated mode. The DRAMA application provides an existence proof of a real application that can execute correctly (and more efficiently) using the weakened form of inference provided by Loom's backward chaining facility.

Reference-contexts: The abstract description of an instance has the potential to be much larger (take up more space) than the originally asserted facts about that instance. Some classical classifiers are turning to an incremental approach wherein successively more detailed partial abstractions of an instance are generated during a recognition cycle <ref> (Kindermann, 1991) </ref>. However, because of concerns with possible performance problems, the Loom choice is to implement a completely different recognition algorithm. We see two potential areas where performance of the classic A/C algorithm may deteriorate: (1a) Instances in a knowledge base are typically pairwise distinguishable.

Reference-contexts: The Loom strategy is to implement a specialized subsumption test that allows it to directly compare I against D, thus avoiding the necessity for generating an abstract description.

Reference-contexts: The kind of reasoning obtainable with a classifier has proved to be useful in a wide variety of applications (Patel-Schneider et al., 1990). A recognizer is a reasoner that complements the abilities of a classifier. Recognition (also called "realization" <ref> (Nebel, 1990) </ref>) refers to a process that computes instantiation relationships between instances and concepts in a knowledge base. An instantiation relationship holds between an instance and a concept if the instance satisfies (belongs to) that concept.
