Title: 3D Visibility made visibly simple: an introduction to the Visibility Skeleton  
Author: Fredo Durand, George Drettakis, Claude Puech iMAGIS/GRAVIR-IMAG 
Abstract: Many problems in computer graphics require accurate global visibility information, such as the view from a given point, the mutual visibility of two objects (e.g. lighting simulation), the limits of umbra and penumbra, etc. Previous approaches have used coarse approximations or have been complicated to implement, numerically unstable and very expensive both in storage and time. We present a new data-structure, the Visibility Skeleton, a multi-purpose tool which can answer many types of queries. It is easy to implement and has been tested with scenes of a few hundred polygons. We present the visual events which encode all visibility changes for polygonal scenes and sketch a construction algorithm as well as queries such as the computation of the part of a polygon visible from a vertex of the scene and the limits of umbra and penumbra between two polygons.
