Abstract: We describe here the conceptual design of Cicero, an application-independent human-computer interaction manager that performs runtime media coordination and allocation, so as to adapt dynamically to the presentation context; knows what it is presenting, so as to maintain coherent extended human-machine dialogues; and is plug-in compatible with host information resources such as briefing associate workstations, expert systems, databases, etc., as well as with multiple media such as natural language, graphics, etc. The system design calls for two linked reactive planners that coordinate the actions of the systems media and information sources. To enable presentational flexibility, the capabilities of each medium and the nature of the contents of each information source are semantically modeled as Virtual Devices abstract descriptions of device I/O capabilities and abstract information types respectively, in a single uniform knowledge representation framework. These models facilitate extensibility by supporting the specification of new interaction behaviors and the inclusion of new media and information sources.

Reference-contexts: What is required are two reactive planners similar to the planner embodied in the PENGI system <ref> [Agre & Chapman 87] </ref>, that contain numerous rules that fire when they match the context and produce result in the next incremental step of behavior, without overmuch concern for long-range planning. 3.3.2.

Reference-contexts: For our purposes, we have chosen to borrow and adapt a partial classification of a producers communicative goals from existing work on Speech Acts. More details are provided in <ref> [Arens et al. 93b] </ref>. Cicero : A Model-Based Multimedia Interaction Manager 10 3.2.4. <p> Consider first the operation of the bottom-up media allocation planner: at some point, its rules may call for it to arrange material from two separate portions of the discourse structure to be presented in a single display (for an example see <ref> [Arens et al. 93b] </ref>). In order to signal to the perceiver what is going on, however, the display must include a message, possibly a line of text, explaining that due to the basic similarity of the material two separate sets of information are shown in the same display. <p> Based on our experiments with prototype systems, Cicero should contain two linked reactive planners that perform runtime discourse construction and medium allocation planning, as outlined and tested in <ref> [Arens et al. 93b, Hovy & Arens 93] </ref>, as follows: 1. Content planning process (Planner 1): Operators construct the Discourse Structure from data elements and their interrelationships. Planning decisions are based upon: presenters communicative goal (s), characteristics of data available for presentation, perceivers knowledge, goals, interests, etc. 2. <p> To illustrate the working of the Presentation Planners and Information Integrator the central processing modules of Cicero we include a worked example from the domain of Swiss cheese sales as described in <ref> [Arens et al. 93b] </ref>. For the years 1988 and 1989, the database contains the following (numbers represent Kilotons of cheese sold in the region and year): Ident Region 1988 1989 A. East Europe 4.3 5.6 B. Switzerland 13.1 14.0 C. Outside Europe 5.3 5.5 D.

Reference-contexts: This platform includes two types of components: powerful interaction modules and an architecture that supports them. In early recognition of the need for a single framework to embed multiple components to form a functioning system, the ABE system was developed some time ago. ABE <ref> [Erman et al. 87] </ref> was a gallant attempt that fell short because it did not fully take into account the semantics of the intermodule and usersystem communication, just the syntax.

Reference-contexts: Work on automatic presentation is evolving along two distinct lines: systems dealing only with graphics (APT [Mackinley 86b], BOZ , SAGE), and systems dealing with a combination of natural language and line drawings (II , COMET <ref> [Feiner & McKeown 90] </ref>, WIP [Wahlster et al. 91]). Systems of the first type concentrate entirely (or primarily) on one medium of presentation, and hence do not develop generic models of media capabilities.

Cicero : A Model-Based Multimedia Interaction Manager 4 2. Architecture 2.1. <p> Automated text generators, when possessing a rich grammar and lexicon, typically require several producer-related aspects to specify their parameters fully. For example, the PAULINE generator <ref> [Hovy 88] </ref> produced numerous variations from the same underlying representation depending on its input parameters, which included the following presenter-oriented features: Producers goals with respect to perceiver: These goals all address some aspect of the perceivers mental knowledge or state, and include: affect perceivers knowledge: takes such values as teach, inform, <p> More details are provided in [Arens et al. 93b].

Reference-contexts: We demonstrated the possibility of doing this for the natural language medium alone in <ref> [Hovy & Arens 91] </ref>. Unfortunately, as the selection of media becomes larger and the information to be displayed more flexible, a more sophisticated approach is needed. The combinatorial possibilities inherent in such a diverse rule set or plan library make the appealing straightforward top-down planning approach of text planning infeasible.

Reference-contexts: The characteristics of various media must be represented in a class of models which we called Virtual Devices in a recent study <ref> [ISAT 91] </ref>. A Virtual Device is a model of a particular I/O functionality that may be realized by numerous different combinations of hardware and/or software. For example, the 2-dimensional pointing device (a Virtual Device) may be realized by the following concrete devices: the mouse, the touchscreen, and the light pen. <p> Systems of the first type concentrate entirely (or primarily) on one medium of presentation, and hence do not develop generic models of media capabilities. As discussed in <ref> [ISAT 91] </ref>, however, generic models (called there Virtual Devices) are necessary to ensure the plug-in compatibility of new media.

Reference-contexts: Although the automated parsing of discourse is a very difficult unsolved problem in general (see, for example, [Cohen et al. 90]), the domains typically addressed are structured enough to support high-level structures called scripts <ref> [Schank & Abelson 77] </ref>, which provide possible attachment points and legal dialogue moves for the users inputs. An analysis of typical user tasks in each domain must be performed to identify the appropriate scripts, which must then be coded into Cicero s semantic model of the application tasks. 4.

Reference-contexts: Associated taxonomies, of functions, techniques of use, human and task characteristics, etc., can also be formed. These Virtual Devices form the models used by Intelligent Agents and interface construction tools, somewhat along the lines described in <ref> [Szekely et al. 93] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Existing research provides considerable material with a bearing on the topic, including especially the work in Cognitive Psychology on issues of human perception which influence the appropriateness of media choices for presentation of certain types of data. A survey and discussion of these results is presented in <ref> [Vossers 91] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Therefore a second, distinct, planning process is needed; it constructs out of the initial discourse structure a separate, generally not isomorphic, Presentation Structure. As we have shown, the medium allocation planner has a more bottom-up nature. The sophisticated presentation planning system WIP <ref> [Wahlster et al. 91] </ref>, for example, contains both a top-down and a bottom-up phase, although it does not create a distinct presentation structure. In our formulation, the discourse structure simply provides the basic organization of the information to be presented. <p> Work on automatic presentation is evolving along two distinct lines: systems dealing only with graphics (APT [Mackinley 86b], BOZ , SAGE), and systems dealing with a combination of natural language and line drawings (II , COMET [Feiner & McKeown 90], WIP <ref> [Wahlster et al. 91] </ref>). Systems of the first type concentrate entirely (or primarily) on one medium of presentation, and hence do not develop generic models of media capabilities. As discussed in [ISAT 91], however, generic models (called there Virtual Devices) are necessary to ensure the plug-in compatibility of new media.
