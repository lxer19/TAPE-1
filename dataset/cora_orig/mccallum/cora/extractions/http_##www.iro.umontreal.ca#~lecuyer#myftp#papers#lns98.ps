Reference-contexts: Under H 0 , for n o k, the number of boxes where X i exceeds 2 is approximately Poisson with mean 2 = n (n 1)(n 2)=(6k 2 ) <ref> [AGG89] </ref>. Considering that the p-values of these three statistics are almost the 1.

Reference-contexts: This was proved by Good [Goo53]. The standard rule of thumb recommends to take n=k 5 for the chi-square approximation to be good. This is called the overlapping serial test or the overlapping t-tuple test (often with m instead of t in the notation) in the literature <ref> [Alt88, LW97, Mar85, Weg95] </ref>. In the sparse case, we believe that ~ X 2 converge to a normal with mean d t1 (d1) and variance 2d t1 (d1). No rigourous proof of this is currently available according to our knowledge but plenty of numerical experimentation supports it.

Reference-contexts: We now briefly explain this notion. For more details about its analysis and the relationship with the lattice structure in formal series, we refer the reader to <ref> [CLT93, L'E94, L'E96b, Tez95] </ref>. Partition the interval [0; 1] into 2 ` segments of equal length, where ` is a positive integer such that ` L. This determines a partition of the t-dimensional unit hypercube into 2 t` cubic boxes of volume 2 t` each. <p> For ME generators, both are equal to zero. Efficient methods for computing ` t for LFSR generators are explained in <ref> [CLT93, L'E96b, Tez95] </ref>. The ME-CF property appears so strong that some may wonder if ME-CF generators exist at all. It turns out there are plenty of them among the LFSR generators and they are relatively easy to find.

Reference-contexts: It is widely accepted that LFSR generators should have a characterictic polynomial of large degree (e.g., k &gt; 100 or so), whose coefficients behave somewhat like independent random bits (i.i.d. uniforms over the set f0; 1g) <ref> [Com91, Com95, MK96] </ref>. So, a rather simple figure of merit that first comes to mind for these generators is the number N 1 of coefficients a i that are equal to 1. This number should be not too far from k=2.

Reference-contexts: If ae is several orders of magnitude larger than qt, there is practically no difference between with and without replacement. For further discussion about this argument, see <ref> [Com95, L'E97b, L'E98a] </ref>. A slightly different requirement would be to ask for the set t to look like a typical set of i.i.d. U (0; 1) random points. <p> It is widely accepted that LFSR generators should have a characterictic polynomial of large degree (e.g., k &gt; 100 or so), whose coefficients behave somewhat like independent random bits (i.i.d. uniforms over the set f0; 1g) <ref> [Com91, Com95, MK96] </ref>. So, a rather simple figure of merit that first comes to mind for these generators is the number N 1 of coefficients a i that are equal to 1. This number should be not too far from k=2. <p> The tests simply go fishing. Any finite set of tests can miss certain particular defects. No amount of testing can guarantee that a generator is foolproof. In fact, any RNG has its own particular structure. As pointed out by Compagner <ref> [Com95] </ref>, the bad things happen when the structure of the simulation problem at hand interacts constructively with the structure of the RNG.

Reference-contexts: Absolute lower bounds on d t are available for general lattices having m k points in the hypercube [0; 1) t . Let d fl t (m k ) be such a lower bound (for further details, see [Knu81] for t 8 and <ref> [CS88, L'E98b, L'E97a] </ref> for more general t). The value of d t can be normalized to S t = t (m k ) ; which lies between 0 and 1.

Reference-contexts: The hypothesis H 0 can then be tested by measuring the goodness-of-fit between ^ F N and the uniform distribution. Standard goodness-of-fit tests such as those of Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS), Anderson-Darling (AD), Cramer-von Mises, Watson, etc., can be used for that purpose. We suggest <ref> [Dur73, Ste86a] </ref> as good references about these types of tests. 3.3 Collections of Empirical Tests A classical list of statistical tests for RNGs is given by Knuth [Knu81]. More recently, Marsaglia [Mar96] has made available a large battery of tests with specifically chosen parameters, under the name of DIEHARD. 1.

Reference-contexts: This type of nonlinear generator has been proposed by Eichenauer-Herrmann and is discussed in [Eic92, EHW97, Hel95, LW97]. 5.3 Compound Cubic Congruential Generators Our next collection contains a recent type of generator, the compound cubic congruential generators (CCCG), in the form proposed by Eichenauer-Herrmann <ref> [EH97] </ref>, with two components. These generators are defined as follows. Let m 1 and m 2 be two distinct primes, a 1 and a 2 two positive 1. <p> These values are not so easy to find, because simple maximum period conditions are not available, and because these values are rare. Fourteen pairs (m 1 ; a 1 ) that produce maximum period are given in <ref> [EH97] </ref>, for m 1 near 2 15 . Table 1.2 gives the pairs that we use to construct our collection of CCCGs. These pairs (m j ; a j ) all yield the maximal period m j , and they were found by brute force computations.

Reference-contexts: Among all such families that cover L t (and also t ), choose one for which the distance between the successive hyperplanes is the largest, and let d t be this distance. Computing this number d t is often called the spectral test <ref> [Fis96, Knu81] </ref>, for historical reasons. For a fixed cardinality of the set t , a smaller d t means that t is more uniformly spread over the unit hypercube, and this is what we want. <p> See, e.g., <ref> [AG85, Fis96] </ref>. The quantity d t turns out to be the most popular. 6 Pierre L'Ecuyer and Peter Hellekalek 2.4 Equidistribution for Regular Partitions in Cubic Boxes Among the alternatives to (1.1-1.2), there is a large class of generators based on arithmetic modulo 2. <p> This works for general m but for more concreteness let us assume henceforth that m = 2. This is the most popular case. This generator is called a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) or Tausworthe generator <ref> [Fis96, L'E94, Nie92, Tau65] </ref>. A commonly used and economic version is based on the recurrence x n = (x nr + x nk ) mod 2, whose characteristic polynomial is a trinomial. <p> All other members of this class are also special cases of (1.5). The test based on X 2 , with n=k &gt; 5 or so, is often called the serial test or t-tuple test <ref> [Fis96, Knu81] </ref>. The Collision test is analyzed by Knuth [Knu81], who gives an algorithm to calculate the exact distribution of C. <p> For the results that we just gave, the number of points is much less than the number of boxes. But in the classical application of the serial test <ref> [Knu81, Fis96] </ref>, the number of points is usually at least 5 to 10 times the number of boxes. This is the dense case. In Tables 1.6 and 1.7, we give the p-values for X 2 , for the good and bad LCGs, respectively, for k 0 = n=8.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the discrepancy is defined for all types of generators, not only for MRGs or LFSRs for instance. Recently, a new family of equidistribution measures has been introduced by Hellekalek <ref> [Hel97] </ref>, the weighted spectral test. Two realizations of this general concept are the classical diaphony (see [HN98]) and the dyadic dia-phony [HL97]. These two figures of merit allow the same kind of number-theoretic estimates as discrepancy, but are much easier to compute.

Note that this second assumption is important and often not satisfied in practice, because several commonly used test statistics have in fact a discrete distribution <ref> [Knu81] </ref>. But if this discrete distribution is well-approximated by a continuous one, the p 1;i will be approximately U (0; 1). The hypothesis H 0 can then be tested by measuring the goodness-of-fit between ^ F N and the uniform distribution. <p> We suggest [Dur73, Ste86a] as good references about these types of tests. 3.3 Collections of Empirical Tests A classical list of statistical tests for RNGs is given by Knuth <ref> [Knu81] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: See <ref> [LCS97, RS78, SB78] </ref> for details. The spacings between the first few successive jumps of Y n should be approximately i.i.d. exponentials with mean one, and this can be the basis of a test. <p> U (0; 1) under H 0 if n is large and M is relatively small. As a simple rule of thumb, it is reported in <ref> [LCS97] </ref> that the approximation is accurate for n 4M 2 . Values of M in the range from 10 to 100 are reasonable. Computing the M nearest pairs turns out to be faster for larger p and the supremum norm (p = 1) is a very good choice. <p> This is the M -nearest-pairs test (M -NP test) proposed by L'Ecuyer, Cordeau, and Simard <ref> [LCS97] </ref>. A simpler version of this test is proposed and studied by Ripley [Rip77, Rip87], using only M = 1. The null hypothesis is rejected when W fl n;1 is too close to either 0 or 1. The p-value is simply p 1 = W fl n;1 . <p> For the two-level NP test, it is typically much better to apply a spacings transformation or a power ratio transformation to the N values of p 1 before applying the AD test <ref> [LCS97] </ref>. The reason is that the values of p 1 often tend to cluster, and these two transformations change the small spacings into values that are very close to zero or very close to 1. <p> The empirical distribution of the transformed values then becomes a good prey for the AD test at the second level. See <ref> [LCS97] </ref> for more details. We give examples later on. 5 Collections of Small RNGs 5.1 Small Linear Congruential Generators Table 1.1 gives a list of LCGs with prime moduli m of different sizes and period ae = m 1. <p> And any LCG with period length 2 48 should fail the 32-NP test with n = 2 24 . These expectations are confirmed in <ref> [LCS97] </ref>, where some widely used LCGs have been submitted to several close-pairs tests. Similar experiments with the serial tests are reported in [LSW98, LW97].

Reference-contexts: The Collision test is analyzed by Knuth [Knu81], who gives an algorithm to calculate the exact distribution of C. Under the hypothesis H 0 , and under mild conditions on f (see <ref> [Hol72, LSW98, Mor75, RC88] </ref> for details), the following holds: If k is fixed and n ! 1, def Y E [Y ] + (k 1)oe C ) O 2 (k 1); (1.6) where oe 2 C = Var [Y ]=(2 (k 1)), ) means convergence in distribution, and O 2 (k <p> However, C and V do not satisfy the conditions for the dense case: In that case, V converges to 0 with probability one as n ! 1. General expressions for the exact mean E [Y ] and the exact variance Var [Y ] are given in <ref> [LSW98] </ref>. The expression for the variance involves O (n 2 ) terms, but in the sparse case, only a few of these terms are non-negligible, so one can easily obtain a very close numerical approximation. In other cases, asymptotic values are available. <p> In [MZ93], the authors claim that it is approximately normal with mean ke 0 and variance ke 0 (1 3e 0 ). This approximation is good when 0 is between 2 and 5 (approximately) but it quickly deteriorates when 0 moves away from this range <ref> [LSW98] </ref>. The interest of the overlapping tests comes from the fact that for a given sample size n, they require approximately t times less random numbers than their non-overlapping counterparts while being almost as effective 14 Pierre L'Ecuyer and Peter Hellekalek when testing most commonly used RNGs. <p> In fact, when E [C] is too small, the normal approximation gets bad not only for C, but for X 2 and H as well, as we shall see in a moment. More details about which distribution is most appropriate in which situation can be found in <ref> [LSW98] </ref>. The results are summarized in a series of tables that follow. In these tables, only the p-values less than 0.01 or larger than 0.99 are given. We call them the suspect p-values. The entries where the p-values are not suspect are left blank. <p> And any LCG with period length 2 48 should fail the 32-NP test with n = 2 24 . These expectations are confirmed in [LCS97], where some widely used LCGs have been submitted to several close-pairs tests. Similar experiments with the serial tests are reported in <ref> [LSW98, LW97] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is widely accepted that LFSR generators should have a characterictic polynomial of large degree (e.g., k &gt; 100 or so), whose coefficients behave somewhat like independent random bits (i.i.d. uniforms over the set f0; 1g) <ref> [Com91, Com95, MK96] </ref>. So, a rather simple figure of merit that first comes to mind for these generators is the number N 1 of coefficients a i that are equal to 1. This number should be not too far from k=2.

Nevertheless, these authors obtain large resolutions by choosing very large values of k (up to k = 19937 in [MN98]). A notion stronger than that of (t; `)-equidistribution can be defined as follows. <p> With the type of tempering that is used in [MK94, MN98], it has been proved that ME cannot be achieved.

Reference-contexts: This works for general m but for more concreteness let us assume henceforth that m = 2. This is the most popular case. This generator is called a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) or Tausworthe generator <ref> [Fis96, L'E94, Nie92, Tau65] </ref>. A commonly used and economic version is based on the recurrence x n = (x nr + x nk ) mod 2, whose characteristic polynomial is a trinomial. <p> called a (q; k; t)-net in base 2 if each rectangular box of the partition contains exactly 2 q points, for each partition that belongs to P q . (Using a different 8 Pierre L'Ecuyer and Peter Hellekalek notation than ours, this is usually called a (t; m; s)-net.) Niederreiter <ref> [Nie92] </ref> defines a figure of merit r (t) such that for all t &gt; bk=Lc, t is a (q; k; t)-net in base 2 with q = k r (t) . <p> If we restrict R to those boxes which have one corner at the origin, the corresponding quantity is the star discrepancy, denoted D fl (t) N . Other variants also exist, with different definitions of the family R. See <ref> [Nie92] </ref> for further discussion. In all cases, high uniformity means low discrepancy. To obtain a generator for which t is super-uniform, one would look for the smallest possible discrepancy, Unfortunately, no efficient algorithm is available for computing D (t) fl (t) N for large N and moderate t.

Reference-contexts: We now briefly explain this notion. For more details about its analysis and the relationship with the lattice structure in formal series, we refer the reader to <ref> [CLT93, L'E94, L'E96b, Tez95] </ref>. Partition the interval [0; 1] into 2 ` segments of equal length, where ` is a positive integer such that ` L. This determines a partition of the t-dimensional unit hypercube into 2 t` cubic boxes of volume 2 t` each. <p> For ME generators, both are equal to zero. Efficient methods for computing ` t for LFSR generators are explained in <ref> [CLT93, L'E96b, Tez95] </ref>. The ME-CF property appears so strong that some may wonder if ME-CF generators exist at all. It turns out there are plenty of them among the LFSR generators and they are relatively easy to find. <p> L'Ecuyer [L'E96b, L'E98c] gives several examples and concrete implementations, among certain classes of combined Tausworthe generators. The TGFSR generator, in its original version, has very large resolution gaps. This was discovered by Tezuka <ref> [Tez95] </ref> and by its creators Matsumoto and Kurita [MK94], who proposed a modification that adds some tempering to the output. The idea is to multiply the bit vector of the output by some well-chosen matrix of bits, at each step, in order to improve the equidistribution.

Reference-contexts: This was proved by Good [Goo53]. The standard rule of thumb recommends to take n=k 5 for the chi-square approximation to be good. This is called the overlapping serial test or the overlapping t-tuple test (often with m instead of t in the notation) in the literature <ref> [Alt88, LW97, Mar85, Weg95] </ref>. In the sparse case, we believe that ~ X 2 converge to a normal with mean d t1 (d1) and variance 2d t1 (d1). No rigourous proof of this is currently available according to our knowledge but plenty of numerical experimentation supports it.
