Abstract: The paper describes a principled approach to the problem of deriving database queries from logical forms produced by a general NL interface. Our method attempts to construct a database query and a set of plausible assumptions, such that the logical form is equivalent to the query given the assumptions. The domain information needed is provided as declarative meaning postulates, including "definitional equivalences". The technical basis for the approach is that a "definition" of the form Head ^ Conditions $ Body can be read pro-cedurally as "Expand Head to Body if it occurs in an environment where Conditions can be inferred". The "environment" is provided by the other conjuncts occurring together with Head in the original logical form, together with other meaning postulates and the contents of the database. The method has been implemented in CLARE, a language and reasoning system whose linguistic component is the SRI

The CLE produces semantic interpretations of sentences in a notation called Quasi Logical Form. For database interface applications, the semantic interpretations are converted into fairly conventional logical forms before query derivation takes place.

Reference-contexts: The approach we take here is closely related to that pioneered by Hobbs and his colleagues <ref> (Hobbs et al 88) </ref>. We include declarations asserting that certain goals may be assumed without proof during the process of justifying conditions; each such declaration associates an assumption cost with a goal of this kind, and proofs with low assumption cost are preferred.

Reference-contexts: So work_on1 (E,C,clare) can be expanded to DB_PROJECT_MEMBER (clare,C), giving the desired result. 5 Existential Quantification We have so far given little justification for the complications introduced by existential quantification on the left-hand sides of equivalences. These become important in connection with the so-called "Doctor on Board" problem <ref> (Perrault and Grosz, 1988) </ref>, which in our domain can be illustrated by a query like (S3), (S3) Does Mary have a car? This receives the LF exists ([C,E], and (car1 (C),have1 (E,mary,C)))) for which the intended database query will be exists ([S], DB_EMPLOYEE (mary,S,y)) if Mary is listed as an employee.

Reference-contexts: It is also fairly straight-forward to use the method to answer "meta-level" questions about the database's knowledge <ref> (cf. Rayner and Janson, 1987) </ref>. For example, Does the database know how many transactions were made in July? can be answered affirmatively (relative to assumptions) if the embedded question How many transactions were made in July? can be expanded to an equivalent database query.

Reference-contexts: In each of these, the formulas before the ) are the premises, and the formula after the conclusion. The inference rules can be justified within the framework of the sequent calculus <ref> (Robinson 1979) </ref>, though space limitations prevent us from doing so here. (2) is the base case: it gives sufficient conditions for using (1) to expand P 1 (the head of the definition) to P 0 (its body).

Reference-contexts: Instead, previous approaches to query derivation which attempt to justify equivalence between queries and semantic represenations have been limited (at least in implemented systems) to employing restricted forms of inference. Examples are the type inference used in PHLIQA (Bronnenberg et al 1980) and Stallard's `recursive terminological simplification' <ref> (Stallard 1986) </ref>. In this paper we will show how a more general deductive approach can be taken. This depends on coding the relationship between LF and database forms not as Horn-clauses but as "definitional equivalences", explicit if-and-only-if rules of a particular form.
