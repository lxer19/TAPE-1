Abstract: We study an approach to concurrent contractions, that is, to simultaneous contractions performed by multiple agents. Using ideas from the semantics of programming we adopt an interleaved approach to reason about concurrent contractions. Although many of the notions from the traditional Gardenfors approach transfer to this setting, our approach also forces us to depart from the Gardenfors framework in important ways. We present laws describing rational concurrent contractions, as well as a con struction that satisfies these laws.

Reference-contexts: T To understand this situation, it may help to observe that there is a clear analogy with some forms of concurrent computation. Specifically, the situation is reminiscent of the concurrent execution of several independent programs on a single processor (see e.g. <ref> [2] </ref>). In a popular formal model concurrency is represented by interleaving. This means that parallel processes are never executed at precisely the same instant, but take 6 turns in executing atomic transitions. When one of the participating processes executes an atomic transition, the others are inactive. <p> The different computation paths thus represent alternative possible `futures': at each moment, time may split into alternative courses and thus has a `branching' treelike structure. A semantic theory of computations provides a formal basis for describing or deducing properties of programs under all possible interleavings (see <ref> [2] </ref> for further details). A similar concern is found in concurrent database theory, where one studies mechanisms for controlling the execution of several transactions at the same time.

Reference-contexts: In the special case where all agents employ the same contraction function, there is a clear connection with the multiple contractions proposed by Fuhrmann and Hansson <ref> [3] </ref>, and with forms of iterated belief change that have recently been described by Lehmann and others (see [10]). Ideas related to concurrent contraction also appear in non-epistemic settings. For example, co-authoring and joint research are processes in which concurrent contractions occur frequently.

Reference-contexts: We start with some technical preliminaries. Our background language is simply propositional logic, equipped with a classical consequence operator Cn that satisfies all the usual properties (see <ref> [4] </ref>). A theory is a set of 3 formulas T that is closed under Cn; a belief base K is a set of formulas that needs not be a theory. <p> (logically closed) whenever T is (Closure) T T (Inclusion) If =2 T , then T = T (Vacuity) If 6` , then =2 T (Success) If 2 T , then T Cn ((T ) [ ) (Recovery) If ` $ then T = T (Extensionality) We refer the reader to <ref> [4, 5] </ref> for a discussion. The above laws constrain how contraction functions should operate on a single, fixed theory T .

Reference-contexts: We conclude the paper with comments and suggestions for further work in Section 8. 2 General Set-up There have been many proposals to alter or extend the basic Alchourron, Gardenfors, Makinson (AGM) framework of theory change (see <ref> [5] </ref> for an overview), but most of the literature in the AGM tradition focuses on a single agent changing a theory as she receives new information. <p> (logically closed) whenever T is (Closure) T T (Inclusion) If =2 T , then T = T (Vacuity) If 6` , then =2 T (Success) If 2 T , then T Cn ((T ) [ ) (Recovery) If ` $ then T = T (Extensionality) We refer the reader to <ref> [4, 5] </ref> for a discussion.

Reference-contexts: Hansson <ref> [6] </ref> gives a formal account of contraction functions able to deal with arbitrary theories. His approach is formulated in terms of belief bases K rather than theories T , and he moreover allows for contractions with sets of formulas rather than single formulas. <p> maximal subsets of T that fail to imply : T = T One-place selection functions are specific for a particular theory; if s is a one-place selection function for T , and T 6= T 0 , then s is not a one-place selection function for T 0 (see Hansson <ref> [6] </ref>). <p> For, in general, even singleton contractions are not commutative, that is: the identity (T 1 ) 2 = (T 2 ) 1 is not universally valid (see <ref> [6] </ref> for a plausible counterexample).

Reference-contexts: This paper is part of a larger project on concurrent theory change (see <ref> [7] </ref>). Its purpose is to demonstrate that concurrent theory change forms an interesting extension of the traditional Gardenfors style approach towards theory change, one that has many faces and that calls for new tools.

Reference-contexts: Recently a number of authors have abandoned this assumption, and considered forms of iterated theory change; see for example Lehmann [10] and Kfir-Dahav and Tennenholtz <ref> [8] </ref>. 13 * In our interleaved setting theory change operations have internal structure, and they are no longer fully characterized by their pre-conditions and postconditions. In contrast, the traditional AGM postulates have nothing to say about the internal mechanisms by which operations of theory change achieve their goals.

Reference-contexts: Here, one of the main interests lies in describing all possible executions of transactions and in identifying serializable transactions, that is: transactions that are equivalent in some sense to serial (consistency preserving) database transactions (see <ref> [9, Chapter 10] </ref> for an introductory overview). In our setting of multi-agent contractions, we take a similar interleaved approach. Concurrent contractions will be viewed as (collections of) sequences of `atomic' single agent contractions that don't overlap and that don't interfere.

Reference-contexts: longer appropriate in our setting: * In our interleaved setting theory change operations need not be functional; they are always defined but they need not have a unique outcome. (A similar deviation from the AGM assumptions in the context of single agent theory change is explored by Lindstrom and Rabinowitz <ref> [11] </ref>.) * In our interleaved setting theory change no longer is a one step operation. Although theory change typically occurs in dynamic environments in which agents may learn new information in a continuous process, the traditional AGM framework consistently avoids mentioning iterations of its operations.
