Reference-contexts: Although Postgres does not currently support user-defined indexing methods, it does provide an unusually wide choice of built-in methods. Of particular interest to us, Postgres provides an R-tree indexing method that organises spatial data for efficient retrieval <ref> (Guttman, 1984) </ref>. Two-dimensional regions are approximated by the smallest rectangle that contains them. This indexing method allows the system to quickly retrieve all regions that overlap a given system or are contained in it.

Reference-contexts: The case retriever is part of MetVUW Workbench, a system for intelligent retrieval and display of historical meteorological data <ref> (Jones and McGregor, 1993) </ref>. Each case is a slice of time (or a sequence of time slices) for which meteorological data is available.

Reference-contexts: This new generation of tools focuses on those tasks that computers do best, namely searching and processing vast quantities of data. As far as possible, they avoid the much harder task of automatic decision making. The rapid rise in popularity of case-based decision aids in 13 industry <ref> (Kolodner, 1991) </ref> is strong evidence for the success of this approach. Like the MetVUW case retriever, these decision aids employ a large memory of past cases and carefully designed domain-specific representations.
