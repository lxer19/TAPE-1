Abstract: Speech recognition systems perform poorly on speech degraded by even simple effects such as linear filtering and additive noise. One possible solution to this problem is to modify the probability density function (PDF) of clean speech to account for the effects of the degradation. However, even for the case of linear filtering and additive noise, it is extremely difficult to do this analytically. Previously attempted analytical solutions to the problem of noisy speech recognition have either used an overly-simplified mathematical description of the effects of noise on the statistics of speech, or they have relied on the availability of large environment-specific adaptation sets. Some of the previous methods required the use of adaptation data that consists of simultaneously-recorded or stereo recordings of clean and degraded speech. In this paper we introduce an approximation-based method to compute the effects of the environment on the parameters of the PDF of clean speech. In this work, we perform compensation by Vector Polynomial approximationS (VPS) for the effects of linear filtering and additive noise on the clean speech. We also estimate the parameters of the environment, namely the noise and the channel, by using piecewise-linear approximations of these effects. We evaluate the performance of this method (VPS) using the CMU SPHINX-II system and the 100-word alphanumeric CENSUS database. Performance is evaluated at several SNRs, with artificial white Gaussian noise added to the database. VPS provides improvements of up to 15 percent in relative recognition accuracy.

Reference-contexts: For example, in the case of linear filtering and additive noise, these parameters would be the log spectra of the noise and the impulse response of the channel. These parameters are usually not known, and need to be estimated during the compensation process.

Reference-contexts: In previous work <ref> [4] </ref>, it was shown that it is reasonable for Gaussian densities for clean speech to be assumed to transform into Gaussian densities for noisy speech. In the present work we use this assumption to estimate the environment parameters, namely , and .

Reference-contexts: Many of these environment compensation algorithms take advantage of the availability of stereo data, i.e. speech databases that are simultaneously recorded in high-quality and degraded environments (e.g. [1][2]). Other algorithms make use of large amounts of adaptation data from the degraded environment (e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>). Still other algorithms (e.g. [6]) use knowledge of noise statistics and extensive computation to adapt the HMMs of clean speech to a new environment. Unfortunately, artifices such as stereo data, a priori knowledge about the testing environment, and/or the computational resource requirements of such algorithms are frequently unavailable.

The algorithm can therefore be used to eliminate the requirement of samples of noise and separately-computed channel estimates for algorithms such as PMC <ref> [6] </ref>. The estimates for the mean and variance can be improved by using better approximations for the environment function and the Gaussian densities. 6.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, the CDCN algorithm has some limitations in that it does not model the effects of the environment on the variance of speech distributions, and the noise is estimated with only limited accuracy at low SNRs. In <ref> [7] </ref> we introduced a Vector Taylor Series (VTS) method, which approximated the environment function by a Taylor series truncated after two terms, resulting in a straight line approximation. <p> We compare statistics of these noisy data with results obtained using the VPS method, as well as results obtained from using a first order Taylor series approximation, as in <ref> [7] </ref>. be approximated extremely well by VPS. In this figure we show the mean of the simulated noisy input signal, as well as the mean computed using the polynomial approximation and the first-order vector Taylor series expansion (cf. [7]). <p> results obtained from using a first order Taylor series approximation, as in <ref> [7] </ref>. be approximated extremely well by VPS. In this figure we show the mean of the simulated noisy input signal, as well as the mean computed using the polynomial approximation and the first-order vector Taylor series expansion (cf. [7]). As we see, the Taylor series provides a reasonably good approximation, but the polynomial approximation outperforms it and cannot be distinguished from the actual mean itself. Similarly, in Figure 3 we present the VPS and first-order Taylor series approximations to the variance. <p> We used the SPHINX-II continuous speech recognition system. In Figure 4 we compare the effectiveness of the VPS algorithm to the effectiveness of other model-based compensation algorithms, CDCN [3] and VTS <ref> [7] </ref> (which do not require stereo data), and RATZ [8], our best empirical algorithm that compensates input speech feature vectors using stereo data. The VPS algorithm outperforms CDCN and RATZ at all SNRs, and it provides an improvement in relative recognition accuracy of up to 15 percent compared to VTS.
