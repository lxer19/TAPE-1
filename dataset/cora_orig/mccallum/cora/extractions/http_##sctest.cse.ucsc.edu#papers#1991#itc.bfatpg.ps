Title: Test Pattern Generation for Realistic Bridge Faults in CMOS ICs

Abstract: Two approaches have been used to balance the cost of generating effective tests for IC's and the need to increase the quality level of shipped IC's. The first approach favors using high-level fault models to reduce test generation costs, and the second approach favors the use of low-level, technology-specific fault models that lead to high test generation costs, but increased defect coverage in the tested circuits. In this paper we simulate complete single stuck-at test sets against a low-level model of bridge defects showing that an unacceptably high percentage of such defects are not detected by the complete stuck-at test sets. Next, we show how low-level bridge fault models can be incorporated into high-level test generation. Finally, we describe our system for generating effective tests for bridge faults and report on its performance.

Reference-contexts: That is, the resistive model of the transistors predict an output voltage always being between 2 and 3 Volts when the bridged nodes are being driven to different logic values. Possible solutions are to employ IDDQ testing <ref> [Ack83] </ref>, apply more accurate circuit simulation of faults, detect the bridge as a delay fault, or redesign the cells so that a discrepancy is guaranteed for at least one input combination for each cell.

Reference-contexts: Note that the transistor strength model used in the COSMOS fault simulator cannot model this fault correctly by assigning any combination of strengths to the eight transistors. Bridger uses the resistive model for conducting transistors that was suggested by Acken <ref> [Ack88] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In addition to providing the weighted fault list, this version of Carafe provides a gate level netlist for Nemesis and a list of fault types to Bridger. To evaluate Carafe's performance we ran it on the ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits collected by Brglez and Fujiwara <ref> [BF85] </ref>. The standard-cell layouts we used for the circuits were provided by MCNC. Carafe's performance on a Sparcsta-tion 1+ is shown in Table 1. 3.2 Bridger An example of how a simple wired-or or wired-and model does not accurately model a CMOS bridge is shown in Figure 3.

Reference-contexts: If the yield is 75%, the test set must detect 99.93% of the defects. Recent evidence shows that many defects are not detected by test sets that detect all single stuck-at faults, or complete SSF test sets, in some circuits <ref> [FS88, SM90, PRM90] </ref>. The studies reported by Fer-guson and Shen, and Storey and Maly consisted of defect simulations to determine which circuit-level defects were probable, followed by a fault simulation to find the defect coverage [FS88, SM90]. <p> The studies reported by Fer-guson and Shen, and Storey and Maly consisted of defect simulations to determine which circuit-level defects were probable, followed by a fault simulation to find the defect coverage <ref> [FS88, SM90] </ref>. The study by Pancholy, et al., involved fabricating easily diagnosable integrated circuits, testing them with a diagnostic test set, and applying a complete SSF test set to the faulty ICs. The complete SSF test set detected only 98.74% of the faulty blocks on the ICs. <p> Such a defect in the physical layer could be caused by a particle of dust on the metal mask or in the photoresist used to shape the metal layer. For a more complete description of the determination of realistic faults see <ref> [FS88] </ref>. Carafe finds which bridges are possible by considering the range of probable spot defect sizes for each layer being considered and finding all nodes that are within that distance or closer to each other in that layer.
