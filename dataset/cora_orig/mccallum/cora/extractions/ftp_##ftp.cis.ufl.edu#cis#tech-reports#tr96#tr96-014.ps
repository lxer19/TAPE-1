Title: Improved Decision Making through Simulation Based Planning

Affiliation: Computer and Information Science and Engineering Department University of Florida  
Abstract: Real-time military planning and decision making involves several different modeling techniques, including rule-based, operator-based and dynamic-model based approaches. While rule-based approaches are generally fast and are more appropriate for simple scenarios, simulation methods and dynamic models, indigenous to the simulation literature, are necessary to plan within environments involving large-scale uncertainty, multiple interacting elements and complex dynamics. Planning techniques must inter-operate to yield the best decisions, and we have found that simulation based planning serves as an architecture for detailed model levels for both real-time and offline decision making. We introduce Simulation Based Planning as a methodology for addressing the complexity involved in Air Force missions while employing an example of air interdiction.

Reference-contexts: There are two levels of the interdiction plan : the interdiction plan at the theatre level and at the tactical air force level <ref> [AFM 1-7 54] </ref>. A theatre interdiction plan establishes the general scheme of employment, and enumerates available forces by type and number. The plan also outlines logistical support, delineates force responsibility, establishes the general system of targets, prescribes the priority of target systems, and describes the anticipated results.

Reference-contexts: Our contribution in the area of planning is to develop a method that allows simulation to be used in real-time, where the simulation is embedded within the decision making system. Consider a simulation system that manages force engagements up to the battalion level. CASTFOREM <ref> [CASTFOREM 96] </ref> provides one such modeling capability [Wargames 96]. CASTFOREM is driven by decision trees and rules to guide what actions occur at any given time. For interactive graphical output on the state of units, JANUS [Janus 96] can be used.

Reference-contexts: To decide whether to accept a course of action, one can use a constructive model (a "wargame") to evaluate the alternatives. Related work by Czigler et al. <ref> [Czigler 94] </ref> demonstrates the usefulness of simulation as a decision tool. Our extension in SBP is one where we permit many levels of abstraction for a model, not just the aggregate abstraction level characterized by Lanchester equations and combat result tables.

Reference-contexts: Information on the implementation is included in Section 4, followed by conclusions in Section 5. 2 Air Interdiction A typical use of the application of force is air interdiction, where the purpose is to destroy, delay, or disrupt existing enemy surface forces while they are far from friendly surface forces <ref> [Drew 92] </ref>. The interdiction mission includes attacks against supplies and lines of communication.

Reference-contexts: An even higher level type of planning is possible by using heuristics in the form of operators and rules <ref> [Fikes 72] </ref>. Rules can use certainty factors or fuzzy sets. Our long-term goal is to explore this hierarchy of planning approaches, and our first step toward this goal is to provide high level planners with a technique we call Simulation Based Planning (SBP).

Reference-contexts: For rule-based approaches, this language can be "rules" or "predicate logic." For other approaches, there are many alternatives: equation sets, finite state automata, Petri nets, functional block models, queuing models. Often the model type is visual in structure <ref> [Fishwick 95] </ref>. The next step is to create a set of candidate plans. For rules, this set is often created through backward chaining. For more detailed model types, the set is created by creating an experimental design and performing simulation (i.e., a type of forward chaining). <p> For our purposes, we view all modeling approaches as being definable hierarchically, so that model types can include both rules and detailed queuing models, for instance, defined at different abstraction levels. These hierarchical model types are termed multimodels <ref> [Fishwick 95] </ref>. We will first discuss the application of simulation-based planning in Section 2: air interdiction. Then, we define the method of simulation-based planning, and finally we illustrate our prototype simulation application which serves as an aid to plan interdiction missions. <p> Mission planning will also involve maintaining a balance between fuel and munitions resources to determine the load to be carried. Considering these constraints, selecting the best routes can be a complex undertaking. 2.1 Simulation Based Planning (SBP) SBP refers to the use of computer simulation <ref> [Law 91, Fishwick 95] </ref> to aid in the decision making process.

Reference-contexts: CASTFOREM [CASTFOREM 96] provides one such modeling capability [Wargames 96]. CASTFOREM is driven by decision trees and rules to guide what actions occur at any given time. For interactive graphical output on the state of units, JANUS <ref> [Janus 96] </ref> can be used. Our goal to to allow a program such as CASTFOREM the ability to make decisions based, not on rules or decision tables, but on multiple simulations that are run within the overall simulation.

Since we treat uncertainty in the planning domain as random variates based on probability distributions, repeated simulations (i.e., replications) using sampled data are necessary in order to perform the proper analysis, which includes confidence intervals about the mean for each result.

Reference-contexts: Variance can be a measure of predictability or stability when the variance is small. Confidence intervals are useful because given a sample output distribution and a confidence level x, the interval states that, within x% confidence, the true mean lies within the stated interval <ref> [Lee 96] </ref>. 2.2 An Air Interdiction Scenario As one of the applications of SBP, we have chosen a typical air interdiction scenario, and developed its Simulation Based Planner (C++) and graphical user interface (Tk/Tcl) within our Multimodeling Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) initiative. <p> Additional implementation issues and their potential solutions can be found in <ref> [Lee 96] </ref>. The purpose of the multimodel is to create a heterogeneous collection of connected sub-models so that one can simulate different parts of the system at different abstraction levels.

Reference-contexts: Most difficulties arise here because methods of penetrating enemy defenses can vary according to the strength and sophistication of the hostile detection, reporting, command and control network, and how much intelligence is available on the nature of the defense capability <ref> [Spick 87] </ref>. Mission planning will also involve maintaining a balance between fuel and munitions resources to determine the load to be carried.
