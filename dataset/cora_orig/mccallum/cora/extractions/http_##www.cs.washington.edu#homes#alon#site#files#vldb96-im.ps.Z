Abstract: We witness a rapid increase in the number of structured information sources that are available online, especially on the World-Wide Web. These sources store interrelated data on topics such as product information, stock market information, entertainment, etc. We would like to use the data stored in these databases to answer complex queries that go beyond keyword searches. We describe the Information Manifold, an implemented system that provides uniform access to a heterogeneous collection of more than 100 information sources on the WWW. IM contains declarative descriptions of the contents and capabilities of the information sources. We describe algorithms that use the source descriptions to prune efficiently the set of information sources for a given query and practical algorithms to generate executable query plans. We also present experimental studies indicating that the architecture and algorithms used in the Information Manifold scale up well to sev eral hundred information sources.

Knoblock. </author> <title> Retrieving and integrating data from multiple information sources. </title> <journal> International Journal on Intelligent and Cooperative Information Systems, </journal> <year> 1994. </year>
Reference-contexts: For example, the Nomenclator system incorporates multiple CCSO, X.500 and relational name servers. Source descriptions are given as equality selections on a single relation, and queries can only reference one relation. The SIMS system <ref> [ACHK94] </ref> also describes information sources independently of the queries that are subsequently asked on them.

Reference-contexts: This time is to be contrasted with the greater time taken to execute a query plan, which typically involves going over a network. 6 Related Work Several systems (e.g., TSIMMIS [PGGMU95], HER-MES <ref> [ACPS96] </ref>, CARNOT [CHS91], DISCO [FRV95], Nomenclator [OM93]) for integrating multiple information sources are being built on the notion of a mediator. The key aspect distinguishing Information Manifold from the other systems is its generality, i.e., that it provides a source independent, query independent mediator.

Reference-contexts: Finding a semantically correct query plan amounts to finding a conjunctive query Q 0 that uses only the source relations and is contained in the given query Q. Therefore, our problem is closely related to the problem of answering queries using views <ref> [LMSS95, RSU95, YL87, CKPS95, SDJL96] </ref>, where the source relations play the role of the views. However, the problem of answering queries using views is known to be NP-complete in [LMSS95], even for conjunctive queries without built-in atoms.

Reference-contexts: SIMS does not consider capability descriptions of the sources. SIMS, as well as the Internet Softbot <ref> [EW94] </ref> use Artificial Intelligence planning techniques for determining the relevant information sources and creating a query plan. These approaches do not provide the guarantees of ours, that is that we find all and only the relevant sources.

Reference-contexts: Briefly, our implementation tries first to find unique identifiers for each constant (e.g., social security number of a person). When it cannot find such identifiers it uses heuristic correspondence functions as in the Remote-Exchange system <ref> [FHM94] </ref>. It should also be noted that the goal of Information Manifold is to provide only a query interface, and not update or transaction facilities.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm for finding semantically correct plans is described in detail in [LRO96]. In that paper we also describe methods for using run-time bindings to speed up query processing and for interleaving of planning and execution. A related line of work is on Web query languages. For example, W3QS <ref> [KS95] </ref> is a system for specifying high-level queries over unstructured information sources. This system enables the user to specify in the query patterns of nodes on the web and properties of such nodes.

Therefore, our problem is closely related to the problem of answering queries using views <ref> [LMSS95, RSU95, YL87, CKPS95, SDJL96] </ref>, where the source relations play the role of the views.

However, the problem of answering queries using views is known to be NP-complete in <ref> [LMSS95] </ref>, even for conjunctive queries without built-in atoms. The main source of complexity is the fact that there are an exponential number of candidate rewritings that need to be considered. This is especially significant in our context because that algorithm would be exponential in the number of information sources. <p> However, Algorithm CreateBuckets is extremely effective in pruning away irrelevant sources. The effectiveness of the pruning is measured in terms of the reduction in the number of candidate plans that are enumerated when creating semantically correct plans. If there were no pruning (as suggested by the nondeterministic algorithm in <ref> [LMSS95] </ref>), we would have to enumerate O (n jQj ) plans for query Q, where n is the total number of information sources and jQj is the number of sub-goals in Q. For example, with 100 sources, we would have to enumerate more than 1 million plans for Query 1.

Reference-contexts: In the first we generate semantically correct conjunctive plans, and in the second we try to order the conjuncts of the plan to ensure that they are executable. The first step of the algorithm is described in detail in a companion paper <ref> [LRO96] </ref>. Here we only describe the aspects of this step that are needed to understand the second step and the experimental results. A semantically correct plan guarantees that the answers produced will actually be answers to the query. <p> Conse quently, only a limited range of information sources could be incorporated. Practical algorithms and evaluation were also not discussed there. The algorithm for finding semantically correct plans is described in detail in <ref> [LRO96] </ref>. In that paper we also describe methods for using run-time bindings to speed up query processing and for interleaving of planning and execution. A related line of work is on Web query languages.

Reference-contexts: The capability records specify which inputs can be given to the source, the minimum and maximum number of inputs allowed, the possible outputs of the source and the selections the source can apply. Sources with capabilities to perform arbitrary relational operators (e.g., full fledged databases) are considered in <ref> [LRU96] </ref>. Formally, a capability record specifies which parameters can be given to the source. A parameter of a source relation R (X) is either a variable x 2 X or A (x) where A is an attribute name and x 2 X.

Reference: [Mor88] <author> K. A. Morris. </author> <title> An algorithm for ordering sub-goals in NAIL! In Proceedings ACM PODS, </title> <year> 1988. </year>
Reference-contexts: If there is an ordering of the subgoals of Q 0 that results in an executable plan, then procedure create-executable-plan will find it. The running time of the procedure is polynomial in the size of Q 0 . 2 Algorithm create-executable-plan is a generalization of an algorithm by Morris <ref> [Mor88] </ref> for ordering subgoals in the presence of binding constraints. The key difference is that our capability records encode a set of possible binding patterns for each subgoal, and we find an ordering that chooses one pattern from every such set.
