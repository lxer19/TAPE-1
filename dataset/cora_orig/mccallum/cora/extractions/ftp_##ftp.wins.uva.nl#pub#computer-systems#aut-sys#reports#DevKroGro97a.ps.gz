Reference-contexts: The method reported in <ref> [1] </ref> [7] uses a parametric model of the image motion to produce the image motion from the the optic flow constraint. The underlying assumption of the model is that the image motion is constant in a very small region S.

Reference-contexts: Introduction The estimation of image motion ^ v (x; t) from a sequence of images I (x; t) is a well addressed [8] problem in computer vision. The assumption of conservation of image intensity results in the well known optic flow constraint <ref> [2] </ref>: rI (x; t) v (x; t) + I t (x; t) = 0 (1) Since the optic flow constraint (1) gives only one equation to the image motion vector at every point, an additional equation is needed to estimate the two components of the image motion vector.

Reference-contexts: The aperture problem: if the spatial image derivatives are parallel or zero in a region in the image, the image motion cannot be estimated in this region. 1 3. The assumption of intensity conservation: The optic flow constraint is only valid for Lambertian reflectors and smooth surfaces <ref> [3] </ref>. If there is specular reflection and/or depth discontinuities in the viewed surface, the assumption of conservation of intensity is not valid. In this paper we will not invent another computation scheme for image motion, but detect the possible error sources as described above.

Reference-contexts: However, it is possible that the variance in one direction is much larger then the variance in the other direction, meaning that only one component of the image motion can be estimated accurately. This is the well known aperture problem <ref> [4] </ref>. Hence, we are 2 not that interested in the variance in the direc-tions of the axis but in the maximum variance in a direction.

Reference-contexts: The "Yosemite" sequence is a mixed realistic and synthetic image sequence generated partly by a rendering application. It is used here for comparison reasons to the literature. The "Otte" sequence <ref> [5] </ref> is a realistic sequence made with a calibrated camera and known environment, from which the motion field is calculated. the corresponding motion field. 7.2 Results In figures 4 and 5 we have shown the curve that results from measuring the density and the mean square error of the selected image

Reference-contexts: To qualify the measure of the disturbance we investigate the sensitivity of the image motion model to noise in the measurements. Propagation of errors shows that the noise of the estimated estimated image motion vector ^ v, denoted by its covariance matrix 2 v , equals <ref> [6] </ref>: 2 b (r b ^ v) (r b ^ v) T (5) where r b is the Jacobian 3 of ^ v in the direction of b.

Reference-contexts: We conclude that the proposed estimated variance of the image motion optimizes this trade-off. 2. Introduction The estimation of image motion ^ v (x; t) from a sequence of images I (x; t) is a well addressed <ref> [8] </ref> problem in computer vision. <p> D the literature (applied on the "Yosemite" sequence: the condition number, the trace and the minimum eigenvalue of A T A S 1 this measure fails because the condition number depends on the symmetry of the distribution, which can be the same for S 1 and S 3 . * <ref> [8] </ref> uses the sensitivity of the model min . However, the reasoning for this is not based on the sensitivity of the model but on re moving the estimated bias.
