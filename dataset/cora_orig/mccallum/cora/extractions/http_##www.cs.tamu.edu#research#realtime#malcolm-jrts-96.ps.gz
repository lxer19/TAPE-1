Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive study of the use of FDDI networks to support real-time communication in mission-critical systems. Due to the potentially catastrophic results of failure in such systems, it is important to avoid message loss whenever possible. We develop efficient tests to check whether message loss may occur, either due to missing deadlines or due to buffer overflow. These tests are extremely useful in the design and operation of mission-critical systems using FDDI networks. Two types of tests are developed: message parameter based tests, which use detailed system knowledge to determine whether loss may occur, and utilization based tests, which only require knowledge of the overall system load. In order to examine the system performance over a wide range of network loads, we also examine the probability that a randomly chosen message set will not suffer any loss. The work reported in this paper is compatible with the FDDI and SAFENET standards, and can be applied by engineers building real-time systems using these standards. fl The views and opinions expressed in this paper are those of the authors only, and do not reflect any official opinions or policies of either Hewlett-Packard (Canada) Ltd. or Texas A&M University.

Reference-contexts: The objective of this paper is to guarantee that no messages will be lost in mission-critical systems using the timed token Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol. The timed token protocol is used in the FDDI and SAFENET standards <ref> [3, 24] </ref>. FDDI is a 100 Mbit/s token ring protocol, and has proved a popular choice for backbone networks in mission-critical real-time systems. SAFENET was developed by the U.S. Navy's Next Generation Computer Resources Program (NGCR), which supports the development of standard computing components for mission-critical systems. <p> After a description of the protocol and its timing properties, we introduce the parameter selection methods defined in the standards. 3.1 Protocol Operation In the timed token protocol <ref> [3, 8] </ref>, access to the ring is controlled by a token that circulates among the nodes. The basic idea behind the timed token protocol is to control the token rotation time. A protocol parameter called the target token rotation time (TTRT) gives the expected token rotation time. <p> The FDDI and SAFENET standards contain methods for selecting TTRT and H i , and we now discuss these methods in detail. The value of TTRT is selected by using a bidding algorithm defined by the FDDI standard <ref> [3] </ref>. At network initialization time, every node proposes a "bid" for the value of TTRT that will be used. The bidding algorithm will select the smallest bid to be the value of TTRT used in the network. <p> The deadlines of all messages in the system will be met if the following constraints are satisfied: 1. The protocol constraint , given by (8), requires that the protocol operation be stable. Note that the satisfaction of the protocol constraint is mandated by the FDDI standard <ref> [3] </ref>. 2. The transmission time constraint requires that there be sufficient transmission time available for every message to meet its deadline. Consider the kth message in stream S i , denoted M k , to arrive during an arbitrary busy interval at node i.

To satisfy the deadline of a message in stream S i , it is necessary for node i to have at least one opportunity to send the message before its deadline expires.
