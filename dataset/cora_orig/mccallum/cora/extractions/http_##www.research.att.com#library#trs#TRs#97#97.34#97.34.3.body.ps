Reference-contexts: Since identification protocols were developed in close relation to interactive zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), Okamoto and Ohta [OO90] (and later Desmedt and Burmester <ref> [BD91] </ref> and Ihto et al [ISS91]) established the notion of divertibility as a language property, i.e., a language is called divertible if it can be recognized by a diverted interactive zero-knowledge proof system.

Reference-contexts: If for given (a; b), an attacker could distinguish valid from invalid diverted out-messages (a 0 ; b 0 ) with non-negligible probability, i.e., probability 1 P (k) for some polynomial P , then he had broken the simultaneous discrete log assumption <ref> [CEG88] </ref>. ut 5 Conclusions and Open Questions We have introduced the notion of perfect and computational protocol divertibil-ity, and have given a sufficient criterion for the former. All diverted protocols we have found in the literature (see Appendix 7.2) turned out to satisfy this criterion.

Reference-contexts: In this Section, we investigate two examples in more detail: (i) the diverted ZKP that Okamoto and Ohta used to prove their main theorem [OO90] and (ii) a blind modified El-Gamal Signature, which was presented by Horster, Michels and Petersen [HMP95] who built on ideas of Camenisch, Piveteau and Stadler <ref> [CPS95] </ref>. More examples, all satisfying the divertibility criterion, can be found in Appendix 7.2. Since all the following protocols are based on the intractability of computing discrete logarithms, the following definitions are useful.

Reference-contexts: impossibility result carries over to any class of protocols where either Alice or Bob has a "free choice" in her or his private input and there is a polynomial-time algorithm for the other to recognize which input component she or he used. 4.2 Key Exchange We propose diverted Diffie-Hellman key-exchange <ref> [DH76] </ref> in Figure 3. In general, the participants of a key exchange protocol may take private input, but they certainly do not take common input (it is the purpose of key exchange to establish this in the first place).

Reference-contexts: Both illustrate our claim that divertibility is an independent concept rather than a special topic of zero knowledge proof theory. 2 Definitions In order to deal with protocols of more than two parties, we generalize the notion of interactive Turing machine (ITM) by Goldwasser et al <ref> [GMR89] </ref>. Then we define connections of ITMs and finally give the definition of protocol divertibility. Definition 1 ((m; n)-Interactive Turing Machine). <p> The picking algorithm of C is pick , and the domains of C are defined as the cartesian products of the respective domains of A and B. 3 1 This is a generalization of the definition given by Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff <ref> [GMR89] </ref>. Obviously, the linear connection operator h*; *i is associative and we can there-fore omit brackets in the usual way: hA; B; Ci = hhA; Bi; Ci = hA; hB; Cii : All connections we consider in the following are linear and have a small constant number of rounds. <p> x B ; q] view ( ~ A) ~ A ; [y; x B ] B ); view ( ~ B) ~ B ) are equal (polynomially indistinguishable). 2 3 2 The notion of polynomial indistinguishability of families of random variables is de fined, e.g., by Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff <ref> [GMR89] </ref>. 3 Equality (polynomial indistinguishability) is required only for the views on complete runs of the diverted protocol, i.e., runs that the warden has not aborted, for example, because he has detected either ~ A or ~ B cheating.

Reference-contexts: In Section 4, we demonstrate (i) by applying the criterion to a diverted ZKP protocol that Okamoto and Ohta used for their important result [OO90] and to an interesting blind modified El-Gamal signature by Horster et al <ref> [HMP95] </ref>. In the literature, little proof of divertedness is given for each. In Section 5, we demonstrate (ii) by showing a perfectly diverted public key encryption protocol. In addition, we show a computationally diverted key exchange protocol. <p> In this Section, we investigate two examples in more detail: (i) the diverted ZKP that Okamoto and Ohta used to prove their main theorem [OO90] and (ii) a blind modified El-Gamal Signature, which was presented by Horster, Michels and Petersen <ref> [HMP95] </ref> who built on ideas of Camenisch, Piveteau and Stadler [CPS95].

Here, both the signer and the recipient have a private input, namely her private signing key x and his message m to be signed, respectively.

A language L is called divertible, if there exists a diverted zero knowledge proof system for proving membership in L. In contrast, we define divertibility as a 2-party protocol property.

We dare to omit the "(mod p)" and "(mod q)" whenever they are clear from the context. 3.1 Okamoto-Ohta ZKP In their seminal paper <ref> [OO90] </ref> (Theorem 1, p138), Okamoto and Ohta used a diverted zero knowledge proof protocol in order to prove that any commutative random self-reducible language has a diverted perfect zero knowledge proof. We reconsider their diverted protocol and show that it satisfies our divertibility criterion.
