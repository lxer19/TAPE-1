Abstract: Multimedia applications often require guaranteed quality of service and resource reservation, which has raised a number of challenging technical issues for routing. In this paper, we consider two new routing algorithms based on bandwidth and delay metrics. The implications of routing metrics on path computation are examined and the rationales behind the selection of bandwidth and delay metrics are discussed. Two new routing algorithms based on bandwidth and delay metrics are presented and some of their important properties are investigated.

Reference-contexts: A problem with two simple additive constraints called "shortest weight-constrained path" was listed in [2] as NP-complete although the proof has never been published. Jaffe <ref> [1] </ref> investigated this particular problem further and proposed two approximation algorithms that solve the problem in pseudopolynomial-time or polynomial-time if the lengths and weights have a small range of values.

Reference-contexts: However, it may not be feasible to have many parameters as metrics since the problem of finding a path subject to multiple constraints is inherently difficult. A problem with two simple additive constraints called "shortest weight-constrained path" was listed in <ref> [2] </ref> as NP-complete although the proof has never been published. Jaffe [1] investigated this particular problem further and proposed two approximation algorithms that solve the problem in pseudopolynomial-time or polynomial-time if the lengths and weights have a small range of values. <p> Proof: We first prove that the problem of DELAY AND COST, i.e. finding a path with total delay no more than D and total cost no more than C is NP-complete. DELAY AND COST is apparently in NP. Since PARTITION is a classic NP-complete problem <ref> [2] </ref>, we now show PARTITION DELAY AND COST to prove completeness.

Reference-contexts: In a centralized computation, the paths produced by the algorithms described above are loop-free widest paths. However, in a distributed computation, loops may be formed. Note that the loops we refer to here are not the temporary ones that only exist during the convergence period <ref> [3] </ref>. The loops are permanent, formed when there are multiple widest paths with equal width. In a centralized computation, loops avoided with a incremental hop-based scanning of the graph. <p> We proposed two new algorithms based on bandwidth and delay metrics. A major area for future research is the behavior of the algorithms during the convergence period. We will investigate if we can use the techniques proposed in <ref> [3] </ref> can be applied to speed up convergence and eliminate temporary loops may exist during the convergence period. 5.

Reference-contexts: The problem of routing is then to find a path in the network subject to the constraints on its width and length. 3. Bandwidth-Delay Routing Algorithms There are two basic types of routing architectures: source routing and hop-by-hop routing <ref> [4] </ref>. In source routing, a forwarding path is computed on-demand at the source and is specified in the packet header. In hop-by-hop routing, a forwarding path is pre-computed in a distributed fashion across the network.

Reference-contexts: To eliminate the looping problem, we use delay as the second criteria in the path selection. The path selected are the shortest path among the widest paths, i.e., shortest-widest path. The delay criteria also eliminates any loops in widest paths. Shortest-widest paths have the following loop-free property (see <ref> [5] </ref> for a complete proof). Theorem 3:Shortest-widest paths are always loop-free in a distributed computation. Note that Theorem 3 is also a property of the shortest-widest paths and is independent of the algorithm used for produced the path. Therefore, we can use shortest-widest paths for hop-by-hop routing.
