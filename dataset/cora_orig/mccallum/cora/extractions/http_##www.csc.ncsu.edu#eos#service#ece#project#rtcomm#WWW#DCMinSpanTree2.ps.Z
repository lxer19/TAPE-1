Abstract: We formulate the problem of constructing broadcast trees for real-time traffic with delay constraints in networks with asymmetric link loads as a delay-constrained minimum spanning tree (DCMST) problem in directed networks. Then, we prove that this problem is NP-complete, and we propose an efficient heuristic to solve the problem based on Prim's algorithm for the unconstrained minimum spanning tree problem. Simulation results under realistic networking conditions show that our heuristic's performance is close to optimal. Delay-constrained minimum Steiner tree heuristics can be used to solve the DCMST problem. Simulation results indicate that the fastest delay-constrained minimum Steiner tree heuristic, DMCT, is not as efficient as the heuristic we propose, while the most efficient delay-constrained minimum Steiner tree heuristic, BSMA, is much slower than our proposed heuristic and does not construct delay-constrained broadcast trees of lower cost.

The delay-constrained minimum Steiner tree problem is NP-complete <ref> [2] </ref>, and it remains NP-complete even after the delay constraint is removed [7]. We prove in this paper that the delay-constrained MST (DCMST) problem is also NP-complete. However, several polynomial time algorithms exist for the unconstrained MST problem [8, 9].

Note, however, that DMCT was designed for networks with symmetric link loads (undirected networks) only. We show that the heuristic we propose outperforms DMCT, not only in the case of directed networks, but also in the special case of undirected networks. <p> In phase 2, expensive tree links are removed and replaced with cheaper links without violating the imposed delay constraint, and without creating any routing loops. A detailed discussion of BDB is given in [11]. Kompella's DMCT algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> resembles phase 1 of BDB, but its approach to relax the delays is different from BDB's. However, DMCT does not have an equivalent to phase 2 of BDB.
