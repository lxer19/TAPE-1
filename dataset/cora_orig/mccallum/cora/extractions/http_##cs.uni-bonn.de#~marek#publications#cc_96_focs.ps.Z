Abstract: We introduce a new powerful method for proving lower bounds on randomized and deterministic analytic decision trees, and give direct applications of our results towards some concrete geometric problems. We design also randomized algebraic decision trees for recognizing the positive octant in R n or computing MAX in R n+1 in depth log 0(1) n. Both problems are known to have linear lower lower bounds for the depth of any deterministic analytic decision tree recognizing them. The main new (and unifying) proof idea of the paper is in the reduction technique of the signs of testing functions in a decision tree to the signs of their leading terms at the specially chosen points. This allows us to reduce the complexity of a decision tree to the complexity of a certain boolean circuit. y Dept. of Computer Science, University of Bonn, 53117 Bonn, and International Computer Science Institute, Berkeley.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The problem of obtaining complexity lower bounds on algebraic decision trees has a long history (a recent overview of the known methods can be found, e.g., in [GKV95]; see also [R72], [B83], [M85b], [MPR94], [Y92], [Y94], [GV96], <ref> [GKMS96] </ref>). However almost all known results (with the exception of [R72], [MPR94], and [GV96]) concern algebraic decision trees, i.e. decision trees with the gate functions being polynomials. <p> Notice that this is the first nontrivial lower bound for randomized analytic decision trees (for randomized algebraic decision trees the nonlinear lower bounds were proved in <ref> [GKMS96] </ref>). A method for obtaining nonlinear lower bounds on the depth of Pfaffian computation trees (which are the trees with the gates being Pfaffian functions and thus, lying 2 between the algebraic and analytic decision trees) for the problem of testing member-ship to a polyhedron, was developed in [GV96]. <p> This result is however independent from the present paper since relying on the methods introduced below, one could get only linear lower bounds on the depth. 2 Preliminaries Similarly as in <ref> [GKMS96] </ref>, for a given polynomial g 2 R [X 1 ; ; X n ], we define its leading term lm (g) as follows. <p> First we take the terms of g with the least degree in X n , then among them with the least degree in X n1 and so on, till X 1 . One can describe lm (g) by means of infinitesimals (cf., e.g., <ref> [GKMS96] </ref>). Namely for a real closed field F (see e.g. ([L65], [GV88]) we say that an element " transcendental over F is an infinitesimal (with respect to F ) if 0 &lt; " &lt; a for any element 0 &lt; a 2 F . <p> We denote by d-RDT or A-RDT, respectively, their randomized counterparts, called randomized decision trees, which are the sets fT ff g (see e.g. [MT82], [M85b], <ref> [GKMS96] </ref>), with T ff being a deterministic d-DT or A-DT, respectively, chosen with a probability p ff 0, P Observe that for a function a in n variables X 1 ; ; X n , being real analytic at the origin, one can literally extend the notion of the leading term <p> In this subsection we design an n-RDT testing membership to R n + for arbitrary input vectors. Thus, RDT (in particular n-RDT and A-RDT) could have much less depth than any DT solving the same problem, cf. corollary 1. On the other hand, in <ref> [GKMS96] </ref> it was proved the lower bound n 2d on the depth of d-RDT testing membership to R n + . This shows that there is a noncollapsing hierarchy on the computational power of d-RDTs with respect to d. <p> The interesting examples include Element Distinctness in algebraic computation tree model or for n-RDTs (cf. a randomized lower bound (n log n) <ref> [GKMS96] </ref> for n ffi -RDTs with sufficiently small ffi &gt; 0), Finite Union of Balls in R n , or algebraic version of 3SAT being the existentional problem of simultaneous positivity of cubic polynomials.

Reference-contexts: Notice, that the only known so far exponential lower bound on the size of decision trees was obtained in <ref> [GKY95] </ref> for testing the octant R n + under the assumption that the tree is ternary (i.e., branching according to the inequalities &lt;; = ; &gt;) rather than a usual binary one (which branches according to ; &gt;) and besides, the decision tree is algebraic, i.e. the gate functions are polynomials <p> But then one should specify, what does it mean "considerably smaller", and it is more convenient to use infinitesimals.

[TY94], <ref> [GKY95] </ref>), namely, whether x 1 = maxfx 1 ; ; x n g for an input vector (x 1 ; ; x n ). It suffices to apply T to the vector (x 1 x 2 ; ; x 1 x n ) 2 R n1 . <p> Besides, as a counterpart to Rabin's linear lower bound on the depth for testing membership to R n + (see subsection 3.1) an upper linear bound on the size is obvious. The point is that we deal usually with the binary decision trees (i.e. branching at or &gt;). In <ref> [GKY95] </ref> ternary decision 7 trees were studied (i.e. branching goes according to &lt;, =, &gt;) and an exponential lower bound on the size for testing membership to R n + was obtained for algebraic d-DT where d = const.

Reference-contexts: Since R n is a real closed field, due to Tarski's transfer principle <ref> [T51] </ref>, the sign sgn ((lm (a))(" 1 ; ; " n )) does not depend on, whether we regard (lm (a))(" 1 ; ; " n ) as an element of the real closure ^ R (" 1 ; ; " n ) or of its extension R n . 3 <p> Notice that the above argument was necessary since we deal with A-DTs. If we would consider d-DT rather than A-DT, we could immediately apply Tarski's transfer principle <ref> [T51] </ref> to ensure that d-DT runs correctly for any input point from (R n ) n . For the purpose of this paper the restriction on the input points E oe for A-DT suffices.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, we design another randomized tree of the same type computing maxfx 1 ; ; x n g with the depth 0 (log 5 n). This extends the result of <ref> [TY94] </ref> which was for the case of x 1 ; ; x n being pairwise distinct. <p> Corollary 1. ([R72]) Any A-DT testing membership to R n + has the depth at least n. 3.2 Randomized decision trees In <ref> [TY94] </ref> it was shown that testing membership to the octant R n + can be performed by a n-RDT with the depth (log n) 0 (1) under the assumption that all the coordinates of an input vector (x 1 ; ; x n ) 2 R n are nonzeros. <p> As an application of the described n-RDT one could design an n-RDT with a similar depth 0 (log 2 n log 1=ffi) and the probability greater than 1 ffi for the problem M AX = (cf. <ref> [TY94] </ref>, [GKY95]), namely, whether x 1 = maxfx 1 ; ; x n g for an input vector (x 1 ; ; x n ). It suffices to apply T to the vector (x 1 x 2 ; ; x 1 x n ) 2 R n1 . <p> It suffices to apply T to the vector (x 1 x 2 ; ; x 1 x n ) 2 R n1 . If one would like to solve the MAX problem (i.e. computing maxfx 1 ; ; x n g), then similarly as in <ref> [TY94] </ref> it is necessary to have a subroutine which increases a candidate for maxfx 1 ; ; x n g, in other words, which finds an element x j greater than x 1 (provided that such x j does exist). <p> The probability of the correct output is greater than 1 ffi. Finally, in <ref> [TY94] </ref> it is shown that the result of applying the procedure of finding a greater element among x 1 ; ; x n , successively 0 (log n) times, taking ffi = 0 (1=n) equals to maxfx 1 ; ; x n g with the probability close to 1.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The problem of obtaining complexity lower bounds on algebraic decision trees has a long history (a recent overview of the known methods can be found, e.g., in [GKV95]; see also [R72], [B83], [M85b], [MPR94], <ref> [Y92] </ref>, [Y94], [GV96], [GKMS96]).

As computational models we deal with the decision trees (DTs) (see e.g. [R72], [MPR94], <ref> [Y94] </ref>, [GKV95], [GKY95]).
