Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a virtual memory management technique for multicomputers called memory servers. The memory server model extends the memory hierarchy of multicomputers by introducing a remote memory server layer. Memory servers are mul-ticomputer nodes whose memory is used for fast backing storage and logically lie between the local physical memory and disks. The paper presents the model, describes how the model supports sequential programs, message-passing programs and shared virtual memory systems, discusses several design issues, and shows preliminary results of a prototype implementation on an Intel iPSC/860.
