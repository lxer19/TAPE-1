But Lifschitz' formalism permits a kind of incoherence, in the "policy" of varying, which results in nasty unsatisfiability even in very simple, "well-founded" theories. Our approach does not.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Note to Reader: Due to constraints of space, as well as considerations of focus, many details about our new "DAP circumscription" formalism (e.g., its precise definition) do not appear in this paper, but are to be found instead in <ref> [ Grosof, 1993 ] </ref> . That paper thus acts as a companion to this paper. An important common-sense capability is to learn by "taking advice", or "being told", as proposed, for example, by [ McCarthy, 1968 ] and discussed, for example, in [ Dietterich, 1982 ] . <p> In <ref> [ Grosof, 1993 ] </ref> , we discuss these conditions that ensure consistency. 1 of correctness. For example, I believe the New York Times newspaper to be a more reliable source than the Village Voice newspaper, which in turn I beleve to be more reliable than the National Enquirer newspaper. <p> E.g., promotions and demotions may change relative authority. E.g., the progressing history of predictive accuracy may change relative reliability. For simplicity's sake, in the example below, we consider, however, only monotonic inferences about precedence. In <ref> [ Grosof, 1993 ] </ref> , we detail a second example that indeed has non-monotonic inferences about precedence. Consider the following true story. Bold type in the remainder of this section indicates the most essential parts of the reasoning in the story. <p> Next, we sketch it briefly. In <ref> [ Grosof, 1993 ] </ref> , we describe Defeasible Axiomatized Policy (DAP) circumscrip 3 tion in technical and intuitive detail. <p> Represent this default schema via an abnormality predicate. 4. Represent a source as an index or index tuple for the default schema. 5. Represent precedence explicitly, so that one can reason about it, e.g., to infer it from reliability and authority information. In <ref> [ Grosof, 1993 ] </ref> , we detail another example where precedence is defeasible, and formalize it in DAP circumscription in the above manner. The capabilities of DAP circumscription to represent "pointwise" detail about precedence, also discussed in [ Grosof, 1993 ] , are useful, as well. (By "pointwise", we mean in <p> In <ref> [ Grosof, 1993 ] </ref> , we detail another example where precedence is defeasible, and formalize it in DAP circumscription in the above manner. The capabilities of DAP circumscription to represent "pointwise" detail about precedence, also discussed in [ Grosof, 1993 ] , are useful, as well. (By "pointwise", we mean in the sense introduced by Lifschitz [ 1987 ] [ 1988 ] .) 6 Discussion, Related Work, and Future Work The problem we address in this paper has not received much previous attention in the AI literature, especially <p> model-preference logics (e.g., [ Shoham, 1988 ] [ Brown and Shoham, 1989 ] [ Boddy et al., 1989 ] [ Selman and Kautz, 1989 ] ), and on preferential logics (e.g., [ Kraus et al., 1990 ] [ Lehmann, 1989 ] ) See [ Grosof, 1992 ] (section 8.3) and <ref> [ Grosof, 1993 ] </ref> for more detailed review of Lifschitz' approach and comparison of our approach to his. Besides Lifschitz', other previous non-monotonic logical formalisms cannot represent precedence explicitly, e.g., to infer it; or cannot represent it at all. [ Grosof, 1993 ] elaborates on this contrast. <p> 1989 ] ) See [ Grosof, 1992 ] (section 8.3) and <ref> [ Grosof, 1993 ] </ref> for more detailed review of Lifschitz' approach and comparison of our approach to his. Besides Lifschitz', other previous non-monotonic logical formalisms cannot represent precedence explicitly, e.g., to infer it; or cannot represent it at all. [ Grosof, 1993 ] elaborates on this contrast. <p> Consider: where does the information about the probabilities and utilities come from? We would argue that, typically, such information is itself defeasible and arises itself from a multiplicity of sources. Another important direction for future work is to explore how to mechanize DAP circumscription. In <ref> [ Grosof, 1993 ] </ref> , we discuss this more.

Reference-contexts: because our approach, unlike Lifschitz', is a special case of single general circumscription [ Lifschitz, 1984 ] , it is easier to apply results available from the body of work on model-preference logics (e.g., [ Shoham, 1988 ] [ Brown and Shoham, 1989 ] [ Boddy et al., 1989 ] <ref> [ Selman and Kautz, 1989 ] </ref> ), and on preferential logics (e.g., [ Kraus et al., 1990 ] [ Lehmann, 1989 ] ) See [ Grosof, 1992 ] (section 8.3) and [ Grosof, 1993 ] for more detailed review of Lifschitz' approach and comparison of our approach to his.

Reference-contexts: Our approach does not.
