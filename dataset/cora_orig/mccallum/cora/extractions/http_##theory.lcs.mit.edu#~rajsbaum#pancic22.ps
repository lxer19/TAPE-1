Abstract: Let T be a hamiltonian tournament with n vertices and fl a hamiltonian cycle of T . In this paper we start the study of the following question: What is the maximum intersection with fl of a cycle of length k? This number is denoted f(n; k). We prove that for k in the range, 3 k n+4 2 , f(n; k) k 3, and that the result is best possible; in fact, a characterization of the values of n, k, for which f(n; k) = k 3 is presented. In a forthcoming paper we study f(n; k) for the case of cycles of length k &gt; n+4
