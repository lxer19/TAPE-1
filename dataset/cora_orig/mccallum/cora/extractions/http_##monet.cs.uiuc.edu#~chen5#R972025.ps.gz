Title: VGAnet: A Real-Time Transport Protocol Suite for 100VG-Any  
Author: LAN Hung-Shiun Alex Chen, Klara Nahrstedt 
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  
Abstract: Transport protocols currently in use do not have any explicit support for the compressed video/audio traffic over the new high-speed network, 100VG-Any LAN. They do not solve the unbounded jitters for a continuous stream and skew between two synchronized streams problems introduced by the underlying LAN. They also do not provide any QoS guarantees to the applications. The VGAnet Suite provides the services and mechanisms for delivering the continuous-media streams with the bandwidth guarantee, jitter control, and skew control on top of the 100VG-Any LAN and can coexist with the popular Internet Suite which needs no modification at all.

Reference-contexts: We discuss three existing network protocol stacks which provide some 4 of the functions and services for delivery of end-to-end QoS guarantees. ST-II is a connection-oriented internetwork protocol which has been proposed to handle the requirements of real-time clients <ref> [3] </ref>. The protocol utilizes the FlowSpec to specify the application's QoS requirement. At each host/router, the FlowSpec is used by the local resource manager to handle resources appropriately so that such requirements are met. However, ST-II just assumes the existence of the local resource manager, but does not define it.

Reference-contexts: In our VGAnet Suite, the local resource manager is well defined and implemented to provide QoS enforcement, traffic shaping, policing, jitter control as well as skew control. RSVP has been designed as a protocol for exchanging reservation messages <ref> [4] </ref>. It provides receiver-initiated soft reservations of bandwidth to accommodate heterogeneity among receivers as well as dynamic membership changes, but plays no other role in providing network services. The Tenet Real-Time Protocol Suite is a set of network protocols providing real-time guarantees in heterogeneous packet-switching internetworks [5].
