Abstract: An efficient retrieval of a relatively small number of relevant cases from a huge case base is a crucial subtask of Case-Based Reasoning. In this article, we present Case Retrieval Nets (CRNs), a memory model that has recently been developed for this task. The main idea is to apply a spreading activation process to a net-like case memory in order to retrieve cases being similar to a posed query case. We summarize the basic ideas of CRNs, suggest some useful extensions, and present some initial experimental results which suggest that CRNs can successfully handle case bases larger than considered usually in the CBR community.

Reference-contexts: 67,557 43 symbolic Ratio of shared attributes Letter 20,000 17 numeric except class Ratio of shared attributes The Travel Agency case base has been included in this report for two reasons: Firstly, it has been used for comparative analyses in a number of previous articles describing other retrieval techniques (e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>). Secondly, the employed similarity metric is more knowledge intensive than for the other data sets.

Reference-contexts: Besides the theoretical investigations, we already performed a number of empirical tests with CRNs. The complete documentation of the results can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. Before we go into the details about CRNs, we would like to outline what we consider as requirements for a case retrieval technique. Basically, there are three conditions to be met: efficiency, completeness, and flexibility (cf. also [3, 17]): Efficiency concerns the effort required to access relevant cases. <p> Case based systems with attribute vectors often use a similarity measure which is computed as the weighted sum of attribute similarities (composite similarities). These can easily be implemented by special BCRNs ([10]). As experiments show (cf. Section 5 and <ref> [7] </ref>), the implementation of case retrieval using CRNs is efficient. <p> Consequently, we will only show here the results obtained for one dataset, namely for the Connect-4 domain. Differences between the datasets will only be mentioned briefly in the text. For a more detailed discussion of these results cf. <ref> [7, 10] </ref>. data describing the Connect-4 domain. As expected, the time varied significantly depending on the specifity of the query.

Reference-contexts: As an alternative technique especially suitable for the design of decision support systems ([4, 8]), we developed the concept of Case Retrieval Nets (CRNs) as a memory structure supporting efficient but nevertheless flexible case retrieval. In contrast to ABS (an earlier model using spreading activation, cf. <ref> [9] </ref>), CRNs are more generally applicable and do rest on a sound formal framework which allows for the investigation of properties. Besides the theoretical investigations, we already performed a number of empirical tests with CRNs. The complete documentation of the results can be found in [7].

Reference-contexts: Due to the limited space, however, these extensions will only be described informally | formal descriptions can be found in <ref> [10] </ref>. 4.1 Improving retrieval: Lazy Spreading Activation A first improvement of BCRNs concerns the spreading activation scheme as proposed on page 4: Instead of propagating activation to the case nodes only after all IE nodes have been activated, a kind of any-time algorithm, called Lazy Spreading Activation, can be employed. <p> Consequently, we will only show here the results obtained for one dataset, namely for the Connect-4 domain. Differences between the datasets will only be mentioned briefly in the text. For a more detailed discussion of these results cf. <ref> [7, 10] </ref>. data describing the Connect-4 domain. As expected, the time varied significantly depending on the specifity of the query.

Reference-contexts: Thus the propagation of activation to less similar IEs may be aborted if sufficiently similar cases have been accessed. A sound formalism (which in particular guarantees completeness and correctness) can be found in <ref> [11] </ref>. The advantage of Lazy Spreading Activation concerns such IE nodes e which are connected by similarity to many other IE nodes e 0 (but with different degrees of similarity (e; e 0 )).

Reference-contexts: This has led to a number of sophisticated techniques for this subtask, as for example indexing techniques ([13]); kd-trees ([17, 18]); the heuristic "Fish-and-Sink" approach ([14]); the Crash memory model ([3]); and Knowledge-directed Spreading Activation (KDSA, <ref> [19] </ref>). As an alternative technique especially suitable for the design of decision support systems ([4, 8]), we developed the concept of Case Retrieval Nets (CRNs) as a memory structure supporting efficient but nevertheless flexible case retrieval.
