Abstract: Adjerid et al. [2] and Yu [19, 20] show that a posteriori estimates of spatial discretiza-tion errors of piecewise bi-p polynomial finite element solutions of elliptic and parabolic problems on meshes of square elements may be obtained from jumps in solution gradients at element vertices when p is odd and from local elliptic or parabolic problems when p is even. We show that these simple error estimates are asymptotically correct for other finite element spaces. The key requirement is that the trial space contain all monomial terms of degree p + 1 except for x p+1 2 in a Cartesian (x 1 ; x 2 ) frame. Computational results show that the error estimates are accurate, robust, and

Reference-contexts: To begin, let e (x; t) = u (x; t) U (x; t)(3.1) denote the discretization error of the semi-discrete problem (2.3); denote a univariate operator of degree p 1 that interpolates functions in H 1 0 <ref> [1; 1] </ref> at the Lobatto points of degree p + 1; and p+1 () = p+1 p+1 :(3.2) Thus, p+1 () vanishes at the Lobatto points and 0 p+1 () is proportional to the Legendre polynomial P p () of degree p, with ( ) 0 denoting ordinary differentiation. <p> approximation of the test function v is selected as V j (x) = p+1;j (x)ffi ( (j mod 2)+1 (x)); j = 1; 2; x 2 i ;(3.10a) where ffi () = oe () = 0 and j (x), j = 1; 2, is a bilinear mapping of i to <ref> [1; 1] </ref> fi [1; 1]. <p> test function v is selected as V j (x) = p+1;j (x)ffi ( (j mod 2)+1 (x)); j = 1; 2; x 2 i ;(3.10a) where ffi () = oe () = 0 and j (x), j = 1; 2, is a bilinear mapping of i to <ref> [1; 1] </ref> fi [1; 1]. <p> We also solve this problem on a chevron-patterned mesh obtained by mapping the vertices i 1;j = n k + 3n 1 if k 2 <ref> [1; n 1] </ref> ; j; k = 0; 1; :::; n = N ; of [0; 1] fi [0; 1] (cf. Fig. 3.) onto corresponding vertices in by a bilinear transformation and forming quadrilateral elements. <p> We also solve this problem on a chevron-patterned mesh obtained by mapping the vertices i 1;j = n k + 3n 1 if k 2 [1; n 1] ; j; k = 0; 1; :::; n = N ; of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1] (cf. Fig. 3.) onto corresponding vertices in by a bilinear transformation and forming quadrilateral elements. We solve problems with p = 1; 2; 3; 4 and N = 100, 225, 400, 625 using bi-p approximations. Errors and global effectivity indices are displayed in Table 4. <p> We also solve this problem on a chevron-patterned mesh obtained by mapping the vertices i 1;j = n k + 3n 1 if k 2 [1; n 1] ; j; k = 0; 1; :::; n = N ; of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1] (cf.

Errors and global effectivity indices are displayed in Table 4. <p> A similar degradation of performance was observed by Babuska and Yu [9] with first- and second-order approximations in the presence of singularities. Example 4. Consider the convection-diffusion problem u t u + u x 1 + u x 2 = f (x; t); x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1]; t &gt; 0;(5.7a) with f (x; t) and the initial and Dirichlet boundary conditions specified so that the exact solution is u (x 1 ; x 2 ; t) = 2 [1 tanh (10x 1 + 2x 2 10t 2)]:(5.7b) We solve this problem on 0 <p> A similar degradation of performance was observed by Babuska and Yu [9] with first- and second-order approximations in the presence of singularities. Example 4. Consider the convection-diffusion problem u t u + u x 1 + u x 2 = f (x; t); x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1]; t &gt; 0;(5.7a) with f (x; t) and the initial and Dirichlet boundary conditions specified so that the exact solution is u (x 1 ; x 2 ; t) = 2 [1 tanh (10x 1 + 2x 2 10t 2)]:(5.7b) We solve this problem on 0 &lt; t 0:5 <p> Several theoretical extensions of the error estimation procedures described herein are necessary. For example, the performance of the error estimates in the presence of singularities and singular perturbations needs investigation. The latter situation involves small diffusivities <ref> [1] </ref> whereas these error estimates rely on diffusion dominance. At the very least, error estimates become less robust near singularities and in the presence of singular perturbations. A theory is needed for nonlinear problems and vector systems. Likewise, convergence analyses are needed on meshes of arbitrary triangular and quadrilateral elements.

Reference-contexts: Yu [19, 20] proved that error estimates computed in this manner are asymptotically exact; hence, they converge to zero under mesh refinement at the same rate and with the same constant as the actual finite element error. Adjerid et al. <ref> [2, 3] </ref> established similar results for the finite element method-of-lines solution of one- and two-dimensional parabolic problems. Both odd- and even-order error estimation procedures are computationally sim ple. The odd-order estimates only require jumps in solution gradients at the four element vertices and neither element nor edge residuals are needed. <p> Piecewise tensor-product spaces are not as efficient as serendipity [21] or hierarchical [12, 17] approximations which have fewer degrees of freedom for the same order of accuracy. Herein, we show that the error estimates of Babuska and Yu [9, 19, 20] or Adjerid et al. <ref> [2, 3] </ref> converge to the actual error for a wider class of finite element spaces. The important consideration is that a solution space of order p contain all monomial terms x 1 p+1k x k 2 of degree p + 1 except x 1 p+1 and x 2 p+1 . <p> Establishing asymptotic correctness of the error estimates for elliptic and parabolic problems using these new finite element spaces follows the earlier arguments used for bi-p polynomial spaces. Because these proofs are lengthy and involved, we have not duplicated the arguments but, rather, refer to the earlier analyses <ref> [2, 3, 9, 19, 20] </ref>. Although the odd and even error estimation procedures apply to many finite element spaces, we show how to modify standard hierarchical spaces [17] by the addition of certain interior ("bubble") modes (x4). <p> Error estimation procedure. The analyses of Yu [19, 20] and Adjerid et al. <ref> [2] </ref> on square elements suggest how to construct error estimates on quadrilateral elements and we develop such estimates for odd- and even-degree approximations in x3.1 and x3.2, respectively. <p> When the mesh is rectangular and Q p is a tensor product of one-dimensional polynomials through degree p, the error estimates (3.5, 6) reduce to a case similar to the one considered by Adjerid et al. <ref> [2] </ref> and Yu [20] and, hence, they may be proven to be asymptotically correct as indicated by the following theorem.

The theory has only been developed for linear elliptic and parabolic problems on rectangular-element meshes; however, several examples (x5) reveal that the error estimates work more generally. <p> With sufficient smoothness, the convergence rate of finite element solutions is determined by the highest degree polynomial that can be interpolated exactly. Thus, piecewise bi-p polynomial approximations contain many higher-order terms that do not increase the convergence rate. Different bases of order p, such as serendipity [21] or hierarchical <ref> [12, 17] </ref> approximations, typically lead to (i) better conditioned stiffness matrices, (ii) reduced computational complexity, and (iii) simpler implementations. Unfortunately, the error estimation procedures (3.6, 8, 11-14) are not asymptotically correct when used with these spaces. <p> Proof. Again, the proof closely parallels those of Adjerid et al. [2, 3] and Yu [19, 20].

Reference-contexts: They are used to appraise the accuracy of computed solutions and to control adaptive enrichment through h, p, and/or r-refinement. Successful techniques for estimating spatial discretization errors of finite element solutions of elliptic and parabolic problems are often based on residual correction with p-refinement <ref> [18] </ref>. Using this strategy, an error estimate is obtained in a space of piecewise polynomials having higher degree than used for the original solution by solving a finite element Galerkin problem with solution residuals as loading. <p> The error estimation problem may be localized to the element level to avoid a global assembly and solution; hence, reducing computational cost. Localization typically involves estimating solution gradients at element boundaries <ref> [4, 10, 18] </ref> and the neglect of errors at certain points, lines, or surfaces [3, 9, 19, 20].

Reference-contexts: The even-order elliptic and parabolic estimates are local to the element.
