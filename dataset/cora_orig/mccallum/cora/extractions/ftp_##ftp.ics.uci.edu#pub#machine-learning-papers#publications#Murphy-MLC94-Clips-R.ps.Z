Abstract: We describe CLIPS-R, a theory revision system for the revision of CLIPS rule-bases. CLIPS-R differs from previous theory revision systems in that it operates on forward chaining production systems. Revision of production system rule-bases is important because production systems can perform a variety of tasks such as monitoring and design in addition to classification tasks that have been addressed by previous research. We show that CLIPS-R can take advantage of a variety of user specified constraints on the correct processing of instances, such as ordering constraints on the displaying of information, and the contents of the final fact list. In addition, we show that CLIPS-R can operate as well as existing systems when the only constraint on processing an instance is the correct classification of the instance.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this progress has not yet been put into common practice. An important reason for the absence of technology transition is that only a restricted form of knowledge bases have been addressed. In particular, only the revision of logical knowledge bases that perform classification tasks with backward chaining rules <ref> (Clancey, 1984) </ref> has been explored. However, nearly all deployed knowledge-based systems make use of forward-chaining production rules with side effects. For example, two of the knowledge-based systems reported on at the 1993 Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence use CLIPS, a production system developed at NASA's Johnson Space Center.

Reference-contexts: With three mutations, the error before learning was 28.0% and after learning it was 7.2%. 5 Related Work Most of the previous work with production systems concerned cognitive modeling, e.g. PSG (Newell & McDer-mott, 1975), OPS <ref> (Forgy & McDermott, 1976) </ref> and PRISM (Langley & Neches, 1981). Some, including PRISM, have dealt with learning and revision of knowledge-bases. Most of the models explored using these systems have been very different from the CLIPS production system model. For example, some systems had multiple working memories, e.g.

Reference-contexts: In order to achieve this, it runs the current rule-base on each instance and maintains a trace of rule firings. The sequences of rule firings are used to form a trie structure <ref> (Fredkin, 1960) </ref>. The trie structure is a compact representation of all of the rule traces that groups together those instances that share an initial sequence of rule firings. Each leaf stores the set of instances with the same sequence of rule firings.

Reference-contexts: For example, some systems had multiple working memories, e.g. ACTE (Anderson, 1976), other systems associated strengths with production rules that, when combined with the conflict resolution strategy, make the firing of strong rules more likely. Previous work on learning included generalization and discrimination (specialization) of rules, e.g. PRISM <ref> (Langley, 1987) </ref>, and composition of rules, e.g. Lewis (1978).

Reference-contexts: For one mutation, the average rule-base error was 11.2% before learning and 0.7% after learning. With three mutations, the error before learning was 28.0% and after learning it was 7.2%. 5 Related Work Most of the previous work with production systems concerned cognitive modeling, e.g. PSG <ref> (Newell & McDer-mott, 1975) </ref>, OPS (Forgy & McDermott, 1976) and PRISM (Langley & Neches, 1981).

Reference-contexts: The rule with the lowest error when added to the rule-base is added. Initial rules are generated in the following manner. The LHS of the rule is formed by taking the least general generalization <ref> (Plotkin, 1970) </ref> of the initial fact-lists for a pair of instances that have similar final fact-list constraint violations. If the common constraint violation corresponds to a positive constraint (e.g. a missing condition in the final fact-list) the RHS of the rule contains a single assert of the missing condition.
