Title: Intervalizing colored graphs is NP-complete for caterpillars with hair length 2  
Author: C. Alvarez J. Diaz M. Serna 
Date: March 20, 1998  
Abstract: The problem of Intervalizing Colored Graphs has received a lot of attention due to their use as a model for DNA physical mapping with ambiguous data. If k is the number of colors, the problem is known to be NP-Complete for general graphs for k 4 and has polynomial time algorithms for k = 2 and k = 3. In this paper we prove that the problem is NP-Complete for caterpillars with hairs of length at most 2. In the positive side we give polynomial time algorithms for the problem in the cases, caterpillars with hairs of length at most 1 and any number of colors and caterpillars with hairs of length at most 2 and a constant number of colors. It is the first time a problem has been shown NP-complete for the particular case of caterpillars of hairs of length at most 2.

Reference-contexts: Up to now, the bandwidth minimization problem was the example of problem known to be NP-complete for caterpillars with hairs of length at most 3 [Mon86]. The problem can be solved in O (n log n) time for caterpillars of length at most 2 <ref> [APSZ81] </ref>. We will show that Intervalizing colored graphs is NP-complete for caterpillars with hairs of length at most 2 and that the problem can be solved in NC for caterpillars with hairs of length at most 1 (independently of the number of colors).

Reference-contexts: Later it was shown that the problem is NP-Complete for the case of 4 or more colors, while if we only have 2 and 3 colors the problem is solvable in linear and quadratic time respectively <ref> [BdF95] </ref>. A different approach to study the problem is to fix the number of colors and look at the complexity of the problem considering the degree of vertices. <p> We also give a polynomial time algorithm for caterpillars with hairs of length at most 2 and constant number of colors. Notice that our caterpillars do not fall in the class of graphs considered by Bodlaender and de Fluiter <ref> [BdF95] </ref>. In this last work, the authors obtain hardness results for the case of 4 colors, they construct graphs with pathwidth 2, but not trees. The caterpillars with hairs of length at most 2 are trees with pathwidth 2.

Reference-contexts: The caterpillars with hairs of length at most 2 are trees with pathwidth 2. To obtain the result, we exploit the relationship between the ICG problem and a layout problem, the Colored Vertex Separation. Both problems were shown identical in <ref> [Din96] </ref>. The non-colored version of the vertex separation problem is an NP-Complete problem with several applications in Computer Science (VLSI design, compiler construction, etc.) and it has been well studied [Len81, EST79, KP86, Kin92]. In section 2 we introduce the basic definitions and the formal statement for the problems. <p> It is known that for a given parameter k 2 N, the CVS problem is identical to the ICG problem <ref> [Din96] </ref>. Therefore all the P and NP-Completeness results described above for the ICG also apply to the CVS problem.

Furthermore it can be solved in polynomial time for trees, using the algorithm described in <ref> [EST79] </ref> to find a layout with optimal vertex separation. Notice that these results allow us to simplify the definition of colored vertex separation in the sense that we just need to decide about the existence of a colored layout.

Then use the algorithm given in <ref> [KS96] </ref> to decide in polynomial time whether G 0 has a colored layout (see figure 19). By lemmas 14 and 15 if G 0 has a colored layout, so does the initial caterpillar G.

Reference-contexts: A caterpillar has hairs of length at most l if all the simple chains attached to the body have length at most l. Up to now, the bandwidth minimization problem was the example of problem known to be NP-complete for caterpillars with hairs of length at most 3 <ref> [Mon86] </ref>. The problem can be solved in O (n log n) time for caterpillars of length at most 2 [APSZ81]. <p> The above solution can be used to produce a solution of the ICG problem with the same complexity bounds. 4 3 The reduction We will show that the colored vertex separation problem is NP-complete for caterpillars with hairs of length two. The proof follows the schema given in <ref> [Mon86] </ref>. We give a reduction from the Multiprocessor Scheduling problem.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Interval graphs have become very fashionable because of their use as a model for cloning of DNA (see Section 5.2 in <ref> [SM97] </ref>). Recall that in an interval graph one can assign to each vertex in the graph an interval of the real line, in such a way that two vertices are adjacent if and only if their intervals have nonempty intersection [Gol80].
