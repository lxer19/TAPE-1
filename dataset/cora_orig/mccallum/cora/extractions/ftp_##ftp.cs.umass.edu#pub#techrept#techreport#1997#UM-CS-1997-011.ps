Abstract: Design-to-Criteria scheduling is the process of custom building a schedule to meet dynamic client goal criteria, using a task model that describes alternate ways to achieve tasks and subtasks. Formerly, Design-to-Criteria scheduling relied on simple expected value characterizations of method outcomes. The recent addition of uncertainty to the task model and its ubiquitous application in Design-to-Criteria scheduling has greatly improved four aspects of the scheduling process: modeling of tasks and task interactions, evaluation of schedules and schedule approximations, focusing of scheduling activities on more certain schedules when uncertainty reduction is important to the client, and construction of schedules that have more certainty and perhaps employ multiple ways to achieve a particular task to improve certainty. We describe the uncertainty representation and how it improves task models and the scheduling process, and provide empirical examples of uncertainty reduction in action. fl This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. IRI-9523419, the Department of the Navy, Office of the Chief of Naval Research, under Grant No. N00014-95-1-1198, and via a subcontract from Boeing Helicopter which is being supported by DARPA under the RaDEO program (contract number 70NANB6H0074).

Reference-contexts: Design-to-Criteria [3, 6] scheduling is the process of custom tailoring a way to achieve a high-level task via actions described in a TMS <ref> [2] </ref> model of the task, to fit a particular client's quality, cost, and duration criteria or needs. Recently the TMS task modeling framework was extended to model uncertainty about the quality, cost, and duration characteristics of tasks using discrete probability distributions.

Reference-contexts: We discuss the use of uncertainty in the scheduling process in detail in Section 2 and demonstrate the power of uncertainty to produce better schedules in 2 Section 3.

Reference-contexts: In our work, uncertainty is a first class concept that both appears in the statistical descriptions of the available methods and is propagated and related as schedules and schedule approximations are generated. Unlike most work in anytime algorithms that focuses on the propagation of uncertainty <ref> [7] </ref>, we can also include uncertainty and uncertainty reduction in the goal criteria and focus work on reducing uncertainty when important to the client. This ability stems from our task model's representation of alternative ways to perform various tasks.
