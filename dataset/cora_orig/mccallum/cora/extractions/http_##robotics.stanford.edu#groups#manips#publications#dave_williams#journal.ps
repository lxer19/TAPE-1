Title: WILLIAMS AND KHATIB: CHARACTERIZATION AND CONTROL OF COOPERATING MANIPULATORS 1  
Keyword: Internal Forces, Cooperative Manipulation, Control.  
Abstract: This paper presents a new control architecture for multi-grasp manipulation that produces decoupled object behavior and accurate dynamic control of internal forces. The proposed method is based on the integration of two basic concepts: the virtual linkage and the augmented object. The virtual linkage provides a physical representation of internal forces and moments by representing the manipulated object with an equivalent, closed-chain mechanism. Object motion and compliance are controlled using the augmented object to decouple the system's rigid-body dynamics, while internal forces are characterized by the virtual linkage and controlled using a model of their dynamic behavior. By combining torque control with accurate dynamic compensation, high-performance cooperative manipulation is achieved. This is demonstrated with both simulation and experimental results, which show that disturbances due to unmodeled dynamics are well rejected.
