Abstract: While support for IP multicasting continues to spread enabling new applications, an increasing number of hosts connects to the worldwide Internet via low bandwidth Point-to-Point links, such as wireline or wireless telephone lines. In this paper we discuss existing proposals for local and wide area IP multicasting and their implications for Point-to-Point links, identify problems with their integration in this environment, and propose alternative special purpose mechanisms to solve these problems. The main problems are overhead due to IGMP leave latency and unnecessary continuous probing of potentially power constrained hosts. Our solution is an alternative to IGMP mechanisms based on join/leave messages for tracking group membership over PtP networks. After presenting the implementation requirements of our proposed and the existing mechanisms, we compare them with respect to performance, interoperability, robustness and implementation complexity, demonstrating that our join/leave protocol is uniformly superior.

Reference-contexts: IP extensions that support multicasting have been proposed and implemented, leading to the development of the Mbone, a wide area multicast-ing testbed <ref> [1] </ref>. The MBone has been used for audio and video conferencing, following the general trend towards integration of various modes of digital communications in a single network. For these applications multicasting is used due to its potential for bandwidth savings. <p> Multicasts are relayed between routers by encapsulating multicast datagrams within unicast data-grams at the sending end of the tunnel and decapsulating them at the other end. The MBone <ref> [1] </ref> is a virtual network composed of multicast aware networks bridged by such tunnels. Multicast routers may choose to forward through the tunnels only datagrams that have Time to Live (TTL) values above a threshold, to limit multicast propagation.

Reference-contexts: We present our conclusions in Section 7. 2 IP multicasting and Point-to-Point local distribution 2.1 IP multicasting model The basic concept in IP multicasting is the host group, an arbitrary set of network hosts identified by a single, class D, IP address <ref> [2] </ref>. Hosts can join or leave a group at any time. Group members receive all datagrams addressed to the group, while any host can send datagrams to a group, regardless of its membership status. Multicast IP datagrams are distinguished from unicast ones by their destination address only.

Reference-contexts: A variety of global, wide area multi-cast routing, mechanisms exist, with the earliest and most widespread being the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP). DVMRP v.1 <ref> [3] </ref> is a variant of Truncated Reverse Path Broadcasting [4]. Routers construct distribution trees for each source sending to a group, so that datagrams from the source (root) are duplicated only when tree branches diverge towards destination networks (leaves).

Since each router knows which groups are present in its local networks, redundant datagrams are not forwarded by truncating the tree. DVMRP v.3 [5] implements the improved Reverse Path Multicasting <ref> [4] </ref> mechanism, which prunes tree branches leading to networks that have no members, and grafts them back when members appear, thus turning the group distribution tree to a real multicasting one.

DVMRP v.3 prunes and grafts distribution trees based on aggregate membership lists at each router <ref> [5] </ref>. It is advantageous for last hop routers to keep aggregate group membership lists spanning all their local PtP links, since routers serving telephone links can be expected to have numerous PtP interfaces.

Reference-contexts: Another proposal is the Multicast Open Shortest Path First (MOSPF) <ref> [6] </ref> protocol, which uses a link state algorithm: routers flood their membership lists among them, so that each one has complete topological information concerning group membership. Shortest path multicast distribution trees from a source to all destinations are computed on demand as datagrams arrive.

Reference-contexts: Shortest path multicast distribution trees from a source to all destinations are computed on demand as datagrams arrive. These trees are real mul-ticast ones, but the flooding algorithm introduces considerable overhead. A radically different proposal for multicast routing is the Core Based Trees <ref> [7] </ref> (CBT) protocol, which employs a single tree for each group, shared among all sources. The tree is rooted on at least one arbitrarily chosen router, called the core, and extends towards all networks containing group members.

Reference-contexts: The first stage may propagate datagrams away from their destinations until the tree is reached, thus increasing delay, and in addition, traffic tends to concentrate on the single tree rather than being spread throughout the network. Another proposal, the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) <ref> [8] </ref> protocol, employs either shared or per source trees, depending on application requirements. Networks supporting IP multicasting may be separated by multicast unaware routers. To connect such networks, tunnels are used: tunnels are virtual links between two endpoints, that are composed of a, possibly varying, sequence of physical links.

Reference-contexts: Both versions of the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) provide a mechanism for group management well suited to broadcast LANs, since only group presence or absence is tracked for each group. In IGMP v.1 <ref> [9] </ref> the multicast router periodically sends a query message to a multicast address to which all local receivers listen to. Each host, on reception of the query, schedules a reply, or report, to be sent after a random delay, for each group in which it participates.

Reference-contexts: No explicit action is required when a host leaves a group, as group presence times out when appropriate. In IGMP v.2 <ref> [10] </ref> a host must send a leave message when abandoning a group, but only if it was the last host to send a report for that group. <p> Note that on a PtP link, when an IGMP v.2 host leaves a group it always sends leave messages. We use the timer, query interval and repetition values specified in the draft specification of IGMP v.2 for both IGMP versions <ref> [10] </ref>. We assume that IGMP messages, regardless of mechanism, are 256 bits long on the link, which includes 20 bytes for the IP header, 8 bytes for the IGMP payload, and 4 bytes for link layer overhead. We also assume that no messages are lost.

Reference-contexts: The join/leave mechanism is similar to the proposal for tracking multicast group membership in the IP multicast over ATM case <ref> [11] </ref>, although there connectivity between the multicast server and end hosts is over virtual circuits rather than physical PtP links, and the delivery mechanisms differ. The join/leave mechanism is based on the observation that in PtP links the periodic queries result in end hosts sending repeatedly their complete state.
