Abstract: This paper investigates how to observe a planar object being pushed by a finger. The pushing is governed by a nonlinear system that relates through contact the object pose and motion to the finger motion. Nonlinear observability theory is employed to show that the contact information is often sufficient for the finger to determine not only the pose but also the motion of the object. Therefore a sensing strategy can be realized as an observer of the nonlinear dynamical system, which is subsequently introduced. The observer, based on the result of [6], has its gain determined by the solution of a Lyapunov-like equation. From a general perspective, this work presents an approach for acquiring geometric and dynamical information about a task from a small amount of tactile data, with the application of nonlinear observability theory.

Theorem 4 (Gauthier, Hammouri, and Othman) Consider the single output nonlinear (and analytic) system x = f (x) (10) defined on an n-dimensional state space manifold M .

This result forms the underlying principle of our sensing algorithm, which is an observer of the nonlinear dynamical system.

These online observers are capable of correcting any local error in estimating the object pose and motion. We have implemented a force sensor using strain gauges to detect contact locations.
