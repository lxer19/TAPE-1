Abstract: critical. For this reason we developed monitoring tools With the advances in high-speed networking, partitioning challenging: nodes are typically heterogeneous and shared In Section 2 we first give an overview of the network computing. In Sections 3 and 4 we describe a network unpredictable. This environment often requires We finally illustrate how the two implementations behave balancing. In this paper, we use an flow field generation network environment. We use BEE, a monitoring system benefit from parallel processing. We have ported a based on BEE [4], a monitoring kernel for distributed applications over a group of computer systems is

The low latency communication of phase II, each particle is tracked as it moves about the Nectar (200 mseconds host-host) and the flexibility of the grid; this requires an interpolation in both space and time. communication coprocessor <ref> [2] </ref> make Nectar an attractive system for network computing, and several applications groups are using the Nectar prototype for their research 3.
