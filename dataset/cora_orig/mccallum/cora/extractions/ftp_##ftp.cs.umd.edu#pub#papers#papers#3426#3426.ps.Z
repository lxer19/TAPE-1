Abstract: Restoration of images that have been blurred by the effects of a Gaussian blurring function is an ill-posed but well-studied problem. Any blur that is spatially invariant can be expressed as a convolution kernel in an integral equation. Fast and effective algorithms then exist for determining the original image by preconditioned iterative methods. If the blurring function is spatially variant, however, then the problem is more difficult. In this work we develop fast algorithms for forming the convolution and for recovering the original image when the convolution functions are spatially variant but have a small domain of support. This assumption leads to a discrete problem involving a banded matrix. We devise an effective preconditioner and prove that the preconditioned matrix differs from the identity by a matrix of small rank plus a matrix of small norm. Numerical examples are given, related to the Hubble Space Telescope Wide-Field / Planetary Camera. The algorithms that we develop are applicable to other ill-posed integral equations as well.

Reference-contexts: For example, the point spread function for the original Hubble Space Telescope Wide-Field / Planetary Camera had a large amount of spatial variation because of errors in the shaping of the mirrors <ref> [1] </ref>. As another example, if the scene contains two objects moving with different velocities relative to the recording device, then the point spread function is effectively different for each [11].

Reference-contexts: These algorithms are efficient implementations of the conjugate gradient algorithm for finding an approximate solution to Kf = g using the CGLS algorithm; see Bjorck <ref> [2] </ref>. The main problem with iterative methods such as this, especially when K is poorly conditioned, is that they may converge very slowly. Therefore, an effective preconditioning scheme for spatially varying point spread functions is devised.

Reference-contexts: Preconditioning piecewise-constant convolution functions. There are several possible schemes for approximating a bttb (n) matrix with one that is bccb (n); see, for example, the recent survey paper by Chan and Ng <ref> [4] </ref>. In our work, we consider the one proposed by Chan and Olkin [5], which is simply the best Frobenius norm approximation over all bccb (n) matrices.

Reference-contexts: A ^ fi ^ circulant matrix C is a Toeplitz matrix whose rows and columns are periodic. That is, each row (column) of C is a circular shift of its previous row (column). It is well known (cf. Davis <ref> [6] </ref>) that the eigenvectors of a circulant matrix are the Fourier vectors, and the eigenvalues can be computed by Fourier transform of the first column of the matrix.

Reference-contexts: In this first example, we apply our scheme to data used by astronomers to test and compare image restoration algorithms for HST images; see for example the Newsletter of the STScI's Image Restoration Project <ref> [7] </ref>, and Katsaggelos, Kang and Banham [10]. This data, obtained via anonymous ftp from ftp.stsci.edu, in the directory /software/stsdas/testdata/restore/sims/star cluster, is intended to simulate a star cluster image taken by the HST before the camera was fixed.

Reference-contexts: For ill-posed problems, however, the preconditioner matrix is likely to be severely ill-conditioned, and early iterations will be highly contaminated with noise. To avoid this, we take the approach suggested by Hanke, Nagy, and Plemmons <ref> [8] </ref>. Specifically, the aim is to construct a matrix C that clusters the large singular values (i.e., approximates K on the signal subspace), while leaving the small singular values (noise subspace) unchanged. As is shown in [8], this can be done if a spectral decomposition of C is available. <p> To avoid this, we take the approach suggested by Hanke, Nagy, and Plemmons <ref> [8] </ref>.

Specifically, a truncation parameter t is chosen, and the eigenvalues of C with magnitude less than t are replaced by 1. <p> In this case, we would obtain results of the form K ~ K = U + V; where V has small norm, and rank (U ) = O ( ^ fin), with ^ fi t n. In view of these remarks, we assume, as is done in <ref> [8] </ref> for the spatially invariant case, that the entries k ;- of K i are obtained from an infinite sequence fk (i) ;-g satisfying 1 X 1 X jk (i) Since the entries of ~ K i come from these same generating sequences, the following lemma holds (cf.

As in [8], for moderately ill-posed problems with little noise, we can take t 0. <p> As in <ref> [8] </ref>, for moderately ill-posed problems with little noise, we can take t 0.

Reference-contexts: In matrix terms, a spatially invariant point spread function on a two dimensional domain corresponds to a block Toeplitz matrix with Toeplitz blocks <ref> [9] </ref>. Our partitioning of the image leads to a matrix K defined by K D 1 K 1 + + D p K p ;(2.1) where D i is a diagonal matrix whose jth diagonal element is 1 if the jth point is in region i, and 0 otherwise.
