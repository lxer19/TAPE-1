Abstract: Much research has been done on Agents that can help browse more efficiently the WWW. We explore the field of Adaptive Recommendation and break down systems' architectures into four distinct parts. We contrast the two major approaches that are Content-Based and Collaborative Recommendation. We explain the technique of Keyword Vectoring widely used to model documents and users' interests. We compare two implementations of Content-Based Recommendation systems, Letizia and WebWatcher. We also compare two implementations of Hybrid Recommendation systems, Fab and Amalthaea. We finally compare those two types of systems and briefly discuss future work.

Reference-contexts: Which approach is the best? Since both systems show comparable results, it is hard to conclude. It may not necessarily be either of them. For more details on those two systems and results of experiments conducted with each of them, the reader is encouraged to look up the references <ref> [1] </ref>, [2] and [5]. 4.4 Comparison of Content-Based and Hybrid Recom mendations Systems Now that we have looked at two main approaches to Adaptive Recommendation, what can we conclude? It would seem that purely Content-Based Recommendation systems can be kept much simpler than Hybrid Recommendation systems.

Reference-contexts: They are Fab, from Stanford University ([1], <ref> [2] </ref>) and Amalthaea from MIT Media Lab ([5]). We will show how each of them implement the four steps of Adaptive Recommendation and we will also point out the similarities and differences between the two systems. 4.1 Fab Fab uses two types of Agents: Collection Agents and Selection Agents. <p> It may not necessarily be either of them.

Reference-contexts: This method is called Reinforcement Learning.
