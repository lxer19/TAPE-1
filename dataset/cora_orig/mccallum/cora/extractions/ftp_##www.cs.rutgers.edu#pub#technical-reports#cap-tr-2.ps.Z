Abstract: For many design problems, the requirements and/or the available technology change quickly relative to the design cycle. As a result each new artifact designed involves some degree of innovation, and there is much that the designer must learn in the process of doing the design. The Computer Aided Productivity (CAP) Project at Rutgers has been carrying out a retrospective study of just such a task, the design of the sailboat, Stars & Stripes 87, which won the 1987 America's Cup races. The work is still in progress, but already a number of interesting observations have been made:

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Many design systems, including Dominic II <ref> [1] </ref>, Engineous [2], and DPMED [3], approach design problems as being closely akin to optimization problems. The system is given a representation for designs (e.g. as a vector of parameters) and is also given a function that computes some kind of behavior (e.g. strength, speed, cost) from a specific design.

Until the victory of the yacht Australia II in the 1983 races, yacht designers had felt that existing designs were essentially the best that could be done under the so-called 12-meter rule gov erning the design of boats for these races.

Reference-contexts: accuracies and different costs, which one should be used for which purpose? This is not an issue unique to innovative design; even in non-innovative design it can pay to use a simpler model for early design iterations and a better model once you are close to the right design (see <ref> [6] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: We have also seen this kind of explicit reasoning about physical processes as a central feature of our work on modeling thermal manufacturing processes such as ingot casting <ref> [7] </ref>. In this case, the physical processes are heat transfer processes such as convection and conduction, and reasoning is based on conservation of energy rather than Newton's F = M A.
