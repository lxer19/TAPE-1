Abstract: Let a 1 ; : : : ; a d be a basis of the Lie algebra g of a connected unimodular Lie group G and M a compact connected subgroup of G. Let A i be the left differential operator in the direction a i on the L p (X ; dx)-spaces with respect to the left regular representation in the homogeneous space X = G=M, where p 2 [1; 1]. We consider n-th order strongly elliptic operators H = c ff A ff with complex coefficients c ff . We show that the semigroup S generated X and we prove Gaussian upper bounds for t and all its derivatives. For reduced heat kernels associated with irreducible unitary rep resentations on nilpotent Lie groups we prove similar Gaussian bounds. AMS Subject Classification: 43A85, 22E45, 22E25.

Reference-contexts: These Nash inequalities are used to obtain semigroup bounds for second order operators. Then Gaussian bounds for higher order strongly elliptic operators on the homogeneous space are derived via a reduction method from the Gaussian 4 bounds for higher order strongly elliptic operators on the Lie group. In <ref> [ERS] </ref> a slightly less delicate version of a transference method was used to deduce large time Gaussian bounds for the kernel associated with a homogeneous operator on a nilpotent Lie group from a similar kernel on a homogeneous group.

We shall show that the semigroup S has a heat kernel on X fi X which can be expressed as an integral of the Lie group kernel K. <p> On non-compact symmetric spaces Anker, [Ank], studied the functional calculus of Laplace operators. In [Ank] heat kernel upper bounds are derived for these Laplace operators. In this paper, the Lie group G need not be semisimple. We use the notation of <ref> [Rob] </ref>. Let G be a connected unimodular d-dimensional Lie group with Haar measure dg and let M be a d m -dimensional compact connected Lie subgroup of G with Haar measure dm. <p> By <ref> [Rob] </ref>, Theorem I.5.1 the closure of H generates a continuous semigroup S. Note that the operator H is already closed if p 2 h1; 1i (see [BER], Theorem 2.9). <p> 0 there exists a smooth, rapidly decreasing, Lie group kernel K t 2 L 1 (G ; dg) such that (S t ')(x) = G i j Z K t (g) '(g 1 x) dg for all ' 2 L p (X ; dx) and a.e. x 2 X (see <ref> [Rob] </ref>, Theorem III.2.1). Since K t is continuous and M is compact one can define for all t &gt; 0 the continuous function t : X fi X !

( _g 1 ; _g 2 ) from G fi G into X fi X is a C 1 map. <p> Then off-diagonal Gaussian upper bounds as in Theorem 1.4 can be obtained by an application of [Sik], Theorem 1. ffi The techniques used in this paper differ from the usual methods, because we cannot apply the higher order Davies perturbation trick as in <ref> [Rob] </ref>, Chapter III. First, we derive the appropriate Nash inequalities if M " Z (G) is finite, where Z (G) denotes the centre of G. <p> Proof Let H 0 = H + I and T the semigroup generated by the closure of H 0 , where denotes the ellipticity constant. Since H 0 generates a continuous semigroup on L 1 (X ; dx), by Theorem I.5.1 of <ref> [Rob] </ref>, there exist a; ! &gt; 0 such that kT t k 1!1 a e !t for all t &gt; 0. Let C &gt; 0 be the Nash constant as in Theorem 3.1. Let ' 2 L 1 (X ; dx) " L 2 (X ; dx). <p> Secondly, ( e A i fl )(g) = (A i )( _g) (8) P d i=1 j e A i fl j 2 1. If follows that j ( fl )(g) ( fl )(h)j jgh 1 j for all g; h 2 G. From <ref> [Rob] </ref>, Theorem III.4.8 and an elementary transformation to rewrite the right derivatives in terms of left derivatives and an exponential function one deduces that there exist a; b &gt; 0 and ! 0 such that j ( e A ff e B fi K t )(g)j a t (d+jffj+jfij)=n e !t <p> Fourthly, let K and denote the Lie group kernel and reduced heat kernel of the semigroup S generated by the Laplacian = A 2 1 : : : A 2 d .
