Reference-contexts: In <ref> [Fla88] </ref> Flajolet describes an intuitive way to translate recursively defined combinatorial objects into functional equations defining their generating functions . The method is successful for many size functions e. Giving a detailed discussion of the translation rules is outside of the scope of this paper. <p> (t)) with 1id Generating Functions The generating function F d (z) defined for d-dimensional trees: [z n ]F d (z) = jft 2 F d j s d (t) = ngj satisfies the following implicit equations which can be derived from the above definitions by using the trans-lation rules from <ref> [Fla88] </ref>. <p> (z 1 ) = F (z 1 ) (15) The relationship of the univariate and multivariate generating functions is given by: e F d (1; : : :; 1; z) = F d (z) (17) Equations (11) and (16) can also be obtained by applying the translation rule substitution from <ref> [Fla88] </ref>, since a tree in F d can be regarded as tree in F whose nodes have be substituted by a single node plus a tree in F d1 . 4.2 Special Case: Multi-dimensional Ordered Trees Multi-dimensional ordered trees are a special case of multi-dimensional simply generated trees, in which the <p> to prefix subfamilies of trees where the root is labeled 1. 10 Generating Functions The generating function MF d (z) with: [z n ]MF d (z) = jft 2 MF d j jtj = ngj satisfies the following implicit equations which can be derived by using the translation rules from <ref> [Fla88] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In [PU83] several special families of trees were investigated including unordered trees (which are not simply generated). The investigations were limited to counting the number of trees. For the special case of monotonically d-labeled ordered trees which is described below a new result was published in <ref> [Kem93a] </ref>. <p> n the asymptotic expected number of occurrences of label m, denoted M o (d; m; n), is given by: M o (d; m; n) ~ I o (d; m; n) I o (d; m 1; n) (n ! ) We have in a slightly different shape rediscovered a result from <ref> [Kem93a] </ref> where a one-to-one correspondence between monotonically ordered trees and multi-dimensional extended binary trees was presented. <p> The search for the two correspondences was motivated by enumeration results like Corollary 6.3 which chal-lange one to establish systematic correspondences between the classes of objects involved. The first correspondece solves an open problem from <ref> [Kem93a] </ref> namely to find a combinatorial interpretation of the functional relation z 1 EMO d (z) 2 = B d (z) (Corollary 6.2). Kemp's paper also describes another correspondence between monotonically labeled ordered and multi-dimensional extended binary trees. The question arises naturally, whether there are more such correspondences.

Reference-contexts: Monotone labelings of tree families were investigated first in <ref> [PU83] </ref>. Definition 5.1 (Labeled Tree) A tree t = (V; E) together with a set of labels M and a (total) labeling function f : V ! M is called a (totally) labeled tree. If M = f1; : : :; dg we call t d-labeled. <p> In <ref> [PU83] </ref> several special families of trees were investigated including unordered trees (which are not simply generated). The investigations were limited to counting the number of trees. For the special case of monotonically d-labeled ordered trees which is described below a new result was published in [Kem93a].
