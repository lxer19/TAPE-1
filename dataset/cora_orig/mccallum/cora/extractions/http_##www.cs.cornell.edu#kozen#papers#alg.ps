Abstract: Functional decomposition|whether a function f (x) can be written as a composition of functions g(h(x)) in a nontrivial way|is an important primitive in symbolic computation systems. The problem of univariate polynomial decomposition was shown to have an efficient solution by Kozen and Landau [9]. Dickerson [5] and von zur Gathen [13] gave algorithms for certain multivariate cases. Zippel [15] showed how to decompose rational functions. In this paper, we address the issue of decomposition of algebraic functions. We show that the problem is related to univariate resultants in algebraic function fields, and in fact can be reformulated as a problem of resultant decomposition. We characterize all decompositions of a given algebraic function up to isomorphism, and give an exponential time algorithm for finding a nontrivial one if it exists. The algorithm involves genus calculations and constructing tran scendental generators of fields of genus zero.

Reference-contexts: Decomposition of polynomials is useful in simplifying the representation of field extensions of high degree, and is provided as a primitive by many major symbolic algebra systems. The first analyzed algorithms for decomposition of polynomials were provided in 1985 by Barton and Zippel [2] and Alagar and Thanh <ref> [1] </ref>, who gave algorithms for the problem of decomposing univariate polynomials over fields of characteristic zero. Both solutions involved polynomial factorization and took exponential time. Kozen and Landau [9] discovered a simple and efficient polynomial time solution that does not require factorization.

Reference-contexts: A decomposition of f is a pair of polynomials g (x; y) 2 K [x; y] and h (y; z) 2 K [y; z] such that V (f) = V (g) ffi V (h) ; where the overbar denotes the Zariski closure in 2 (see <ref> [6] </ref>). 2 The Zariski closure is taken in order to account for points at infinity in a composition. An alternative approach would be to consider f as a binary relation on the projective line.
