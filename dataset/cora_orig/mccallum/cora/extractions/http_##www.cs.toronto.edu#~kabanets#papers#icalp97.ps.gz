Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In 1960, Buchi <ref> [1] </ref> showed that a language is regular iff it is definable by some formula in a monadic second-order logic, MS. Here, MS is the extension of the first-order logic that allows quantification over set variables. <p> We will denote the digraph G d1 with ordered drop vertices of B 1 by G d1 0 . Example 7.

Reference-contexts: They are also logical structures since any graph is completely determined by the set of its vertices and the adjacency relation on this set. Thus the notions of recognizability and definability can be extended to finite graphs. Courcelle <ref> [2] </ref> proved that every MS-definable set of finite graphs is recognizable, but not conversely. However, he was able to extend the result of Doner to unordered unbounded trees using a counting monadic second-order logic, CMS, an extension of MS that allows modular counting. <p> Among other classes of graphs of bounded tree-width are trees and forests (tree-width 1), series-parallel graphs and outerplanar graphs ( 2), and Halin graphs ( 3). The class of graphs of bounded tree-width plays an important role for another reason. Courcelle showed in <ref> [2] </ref> that the MS-theory of the class of partial k-trees ? This research was done while the author was at Simon Fraser University [8]. The author's present address is Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada M5S 3G4; kabanets@cs.utoronto.ca. is decidable. <p> Using mod 0;2 , we can express in CMS the property that a given vertex subset of a graph has even cardinality. This cannot be done in MS alone <ref> [2] </ref>. 2.3 Recognizability We define the notion of recognizability of partial k-paths in terms of deterministic finite automata A = (; Q; ffi; q 0 ; F ) working on extended decompositions. <p> We will denote the digraph G d1 with ordered drop vertices of B 1 by G d1 0 . Example 7.

Reference-contexts: Partial k-paths are recognized by finite automata working on the corresponding path-decompositions. Our second result deals with computing the obstruction sets of minor-closed graph families. The class of partial k-trees (k-paths) is minor-closed and its obstruction set can be determined from the MS-formula defining that class <ref> [4] </ref>. We describe how to construct the MS-formula defining the class of partial k-paths for every given k. As a consequence, the obstruction sets of the classes of partial k-paths are computable for each k.

Reference-contexts: Strictly speaking, the above results hold for so-called MS 2 logic, where MS 2 denotes the monadic second-order language using quantification over both vertex sets and edge sets of graphs; MS 1 is the language that uses quantification over vertex sets only (see <ref> [5, 6] </ref>). In this paper, we are using MS 2 and CMS 2 .

Reference-contexts: Here, MS is the extension of the first-order logic that allows quantification over set variables. A set of objects is definable by an MS-formula if the formula is true exactly on the members of the set. Thus Buchi established that recognizability is equivalent to MS-definability for words. Doner <ref> [7] </ref> then extended this result to ranked trees. Graphs are algebraic objects since any graph can be constructed from smaller graphs using certain graph operations. They are also logical structures since any graph is completely determined by the set of its vertices and the adjacency relation on this set.

Reference-contexts: Courcelle [3] showed that a recognizable set of partial k-trees is CMS-definable for k = 1 and k = 2, and conjectured that recognizability implies CMS-definability of partial k-trees for every k. Kaller <ref> [9] </ref> proved the case of k = 3 and the case of k-connected partial k-trees. We establish that every recognizable set of partial k-paths is CMS-definable, thereby proving a special case of Courcelle's conjecture.

Reference-contexts: The question remained whether there was a sufficiently large class of graphs for which recognizability would imply CMS-definability. In their study of graph minors, Robertson and Seymour <ref> [10] </ref> introduced the notion of the tree-width of a graph. A graph of tree-width k exhibits certain tree-like structure. Such a graph can be decomposed into subgraphs of size k + 1 arranged as nodes of a tree (tree-decomposition) so that the nodes containing a given vertex form a subtree.
