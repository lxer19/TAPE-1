Abstract: We describe an application of the Generic Planning Architecture being developed at Imperial College to a flight allocation problem provided by British Airways, and indicate the influence that study of this application has had on the development of the architecture.

There are two aspects in which the architecture as presented a year ago <ref> [1] </ref> has been extended. The most significant is the incorporation of generic mechanisms to handle costs and cost minimisation. This has been directly influenced by our work on the British Airways problem, and is essential for the architecture to be of relevance to industrial problems.

Reference-contexts: This notion allows the construction of many isomorphic solutions of identical cost to be avoided in a way that is seen in its most basic form in the graph-colouring example given in <ref> [2] </ref>. In assigning a value to a resource variable, the values considered from each equivalence class are restricted to those values already used in the plan plus only one unused value.
