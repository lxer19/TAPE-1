Title: Project Note MULINEX Multilingual Indexing, Navigation and Editing Extensions for the WorldWide Web  
Author: Gregor Erbach, Gnter Neumann, Hans Uszkoreit 
Address: 66123 Saarbrcken Germany  
Affiliation: DFKI GmbH Language Technology Lab  
Abstract: This paper gives an overview of the project MULINEX, which is a "leading-edge application project" funded in the Telematics Application Programme (Language Engineering Sector) of the European Union. The goal of the project is the development of a set of tools to allow cross-language text retrieval for the WWW, concept-based indexing, navigation tools and webiste management facilities for multilingual WWW sites. The project takes a user-centered approach in which the user needs drive the development activities and set the research agenda.

Reference-contexts: For other languages, existing commercial morphological analysers will be used. Part-of-Speech tagging (disambiguation) is an important step in the identification of phrases. We will use an unsupervised tagger described in <ref> [Brill 1995] </ref>. 3.5 Alignment For alignment, the program TAlign from TRADOS will be used. TAlign is a program for synchronizing (aligning) two texts that are translations of each other. TAlign creates a translation memory from corresponding source and target language texts.

Reference-contexts: Therefore it is necessary to perform automatic language identification. We will use a technique based on trigrammes (sequences of three con - secutive letters), which has been shown to be superior to the alternative method based on frequent words <ref> [Grefenstette 1995] </ref>. Two benefits will be gained from automatic language identification: 1. Once the language has been identified, it is possible to use the appropriate linguistic processing components for that language, for example to avoid classifying the German noun Wetter as the comparative form of the adjective wet . 2.

Reference-contexts: Likewise the word key will usually refer to different concepts in the phrases hit a key and turn a key . Such facts have been used for the acquisition of lexical semantic knowledge from corpora <ref> [Johnston et al. 1995] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A separate index can be built for all target languages produced by a machine translation system, and queried with monolingual queries. Such a document translation approach is planned for the document base on sustainable development in the project Twenty-One <ref> [Kraaij 1997] </ref>. Translation of documents may be a feasible approach for a restricted domain with a limited number of documents, but it will not be feasible for general-purpose WWW search engines due to the large number of documents.

Reference-contexts: For this purpose, we will make use of the Saarbrcken Message Extraction System (SMES) <ref> [Neumann et al. 1997] </ref>, which provides a set of basic powerful, robust and efficient natural language components: the morphological component MORPHIX, a declarative tool for expressing finitestate grammars, an efficient and robust bidirectional lexically-driven parser, and an interface to a typed feature-based language and inference. 3.8 Multilingual Document and Website Management
