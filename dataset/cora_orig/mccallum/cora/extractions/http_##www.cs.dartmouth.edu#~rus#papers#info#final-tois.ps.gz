Title: Customizing Information Capture and Access

Abstract: This paper presents a customizable architecture for software agents that capture and access information in large, heterogeneous, distributed electronic repositories. The key idea is to exploit underlying structure at various levels of granularity to build high-level indices with task-specific interpretations. Information agents construct such indices and are configured as a network of reusable modules called structure detectors and segmenters. We illustrate our architecture with the design and implementation of smart information filters in two contexts: retrieving stock market data from Internet newsgroups, and retrieving technical reports from Internet ftp sites.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the contents of each row have to be interpreted to obtain the precision-recall measures. This last step requires knowledge about the form of precision-recall measures. 2.3.1 Formalizing agents We represent an agent in the language of circuits <ref> [BDG] </ref>. Asynchronous circuits are a useful engineering metaphor for assembling agents from detectors and segmenters.

Reference-contexts: If t ij = t i 0 j 0 the data in row i and column j and the data in row i 0 and column j 0 are *-similar. The type matrix for the table in Figure 4 is given in Figure 7. A GCD algorithm <ref> [BK] </ref> can be used to determine the type, if any, of the overall matrix and thus to decide whether the matrix represents a table. We provide for error tolerance in the typing of each column by supplying an error parameter * r . <p> To do this, we need a formal framework for analyzing what information is necessary for performing a task. Such a framework, based on the notion of information invariants, has been discussed in the robotics context by [Don, DJR] and in the theoretical literature by <ref> [BK] </ref>. Our long-term goal is to computationally characterize methods such as statistics over character sequences [SM, PN], statistics over word occurrence, layout and geometry, and other notions of structure with respect to information content.

Reference-contexts: The table detector expects information to be broken up into pieces at the paragraph level; this is generated by a paragraph segmenter described later in this section. We model granularity shifts in the descriptions of the data using concepts from topology <ref> [Mun] </ref>. A topology over a set S is a set of subsets of S that are collectively exhaustive|the union of the subsets yields S. A topology is closed under the operations of union and finite intersection.

Each font size has a characteristic spacing between lines and characters. Our algorithm relies on the following generic typesetting rules. A superset of these conventions are in <ref> [NSV] </ref>. 1. Printed lines are roughly horizontal. 2. The base lines of characters are aligned. 3. Word spaces are larger than character spaces. 4. Paragraphs are separated by wider spaces than lines within a paragraph, or by indentation. 5. Illustrations are confined to rectangular frames.
