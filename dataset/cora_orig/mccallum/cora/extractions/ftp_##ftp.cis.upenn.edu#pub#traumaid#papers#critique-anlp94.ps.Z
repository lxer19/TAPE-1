Abstract: Summary This paper addresses "kinds and focuses of relevance" that a language-generating clinical decision-support system should adhere to during activities in which a health care provider's attention is on his or her patient and not on a computer screen. During such "patient-centered" activities, utterances generated by a computer system intrude on patient management. They must be thus seen by HCPs as having immediate clinical relevance, or, like the continual ringing of ICU monitors, they will be ignored. This paper describes how plan recognition and plan evaluation can be used to achieve clinical relevance. The work is being done in the context of the TraumAID project, whose overall goal is to improve the delivery of quality trauma care during the initial definitive phase of patient management. Given an early pilot study that showed that physicians using TraumAID disliked the continuous presentation of its entire management plan, we decided to explore how TraumAID could restrict commentary to only those situations in which a comment could make a clinically significant difference to patient management. We took advantage of the fact that actions that involve resources that need to be brought to the trauma bay or that can only be done elsewhere must be ordered. Since orders can be rescinded, comments pointing out problems with an order can potentially make a clinically significant difference to patient management. The contributions of this paper are (1) pointing out additional constraints on language generation raised by the desire to convey information to listeners attending to something other than an computer terminal, and (2) pointing out some features of plan inference and evaluation raised by multiple goal planning in a complex domain.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Ordinary use of Natural Language adheres to what Grice has called the "cooperative principle of conversation" <ref> (Grice, 1975) </ref>. Four categories of "maxims" elaborate this principle. Under the category of Relation, Grice places the single maxim "Be relevant", noting that this terse formulation conceals a number of unsolved problems, including that of "what different kinds and focuses of relevance there may be".

Reference-contexts: evaluation (Section 2), the plan recognition and evaluation strategies that allow TraumaTIQ to recognize clinically significant differences 3 in patient management (Section 3), and the additional problems for plan recognition, plan evaluation and critique generation caused by a planner's ability to optimize plans through what Pollack has called "overloading intentions" <ref> (Pollack, 1991) </ref> (Section 4). We conclude with mention of our planned prospective evaluations of TraumAID and TraumaTIQ and a summary of our main points (Section 5). 2. THE REPRESENTATIONAL FRAMEWORK In TraumAID, a plan is a set of procedures, each of which comprises one or more actions. <p> ACTION OVERLOADING As mentioned earlier, it is possible for a single action to participate in addressing more than one management goal. This strategy of doubling-up the use of plan elements is called intention overloading by Pollack <ref> (Pollack, 1991) </ref>, who argues that it can simplify the process of computing optimal plans. It can, however, complicate the process of recognizing and evaluating them. Our strategy in TraumaTIQ is to assume that overloading occurs in the physician's plan whenever it would be beneficial.
