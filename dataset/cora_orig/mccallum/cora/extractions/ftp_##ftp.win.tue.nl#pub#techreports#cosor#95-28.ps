Reference-contexts: Valid inequalities derived for these models have been successfully used in cutting plane algorithms for multi-item problems. Hence, (partial) linear descriptions of the convex hull of feasible solutions of single-item models are a valuable aid in solving lot-sizing problems by methods based on polyhedral combinatorics. In <ref> [4] </ref> Pochet and Wolsey study four single-item lot-sizing problems in the presence of Wagner-Whitin costs, i.e., when the unit inventory cost h t and the unit production cost p t satisfy h t + p t p t+1 for every period t of the planning interval.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In recent years a great number of lot-sizing problems have been studied from a polyhedral point of view (cf. Pochet and Wolsey <ref> [5] </ref>). Most of the results concern the polyhedral structure of single-item models. Valid inequalities derived for these models have been successfully used in cutting plane algorithms for multi-item problems.
