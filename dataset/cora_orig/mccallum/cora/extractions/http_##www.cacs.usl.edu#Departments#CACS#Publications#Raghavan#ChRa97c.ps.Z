Title: Generic and Fully Automatic Content-Based Image Retrieval Using Color  
Author: Suresh K. Choubey Vijay V. Raghavan 
Keyword: Image database, image retrieval, color, efficient, generic.  
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a generic and efficient content-based image retrieval architecture. We compute "real" interimage distances for an initial subset of the images that are to be stored into an image database. For computing real interimage distances we use image content based on a low level feature. High-level image feature vectors are computed from the real interimage distances in such a way that the interimage distances are preserved in the feature space defined by the high-level features. These feature vectors are used to represent the images in the initial subset as well as to generate a training set. This training set is used to compute the feature vector of a query image during image retrieval and for deriving the feature vectors for images not in the initial subset. On-line retrieval is performed using the distances of the feature vector of the query image to feature vectors of the database images as estimates of the corresponding real distances. We have conducted experiments using color as the low level feature. Our results show a substantial reduction in the size of the feature space, which leads to highly efficient on-line retrieval. We also demonstrate that a high retrieval accuracy is achieved.

Images are represented at a very high-level of abstraction. Queries are also specified using these attributes.

Reference-contexts: Also, the use of estimated distance does not usually preserve the order induced by the real distance among the images. Hence, they cannot perform nearest neighbor type searches. Some other researchers have tried to make the retrieval efficient at the cost of accuracy by reducing the image resolution <ref> [6] </ref>. However, when images are quantized to a lower resolution, there is a very strong possibility that some of the important color information relevant for differentiation is lost. <p> Uniform quantization can be used in RGB color space very efficiently.

Reference-contexts: This image retrieval problem can be defined as the efficient retrieval of the best q images according to from a database of n images. 4 Proposed Method This is based on the work of Goldfarb <ref> [7] </ref> to bridge the gap between syntactic and statistical pattern recognition for classification problems. The whole image database is divided into an initial and an incremental image set. The complete image storage and retrieval involves two phases: database population and image retrieval. <p> This set of images is referred to as the initial set. Let jP j = k; where k n. The value of k should be as small as possible, in order to achieve efficient training. According to Goldfarb <ref> [7] </ref>, the dissimilarity between two objects can be defined as follows: Let a pseudometric 2 space be a pair (P; ), where P is a set of images and is a non negative real-valued mapping: : P fi P ! R + (1) satisfying the following two conditions: (a) 8O 1 <p> For a given O 2 P; fi (O) is called the intermediate representation of O: According to Goldfarb <ref> [7] </ref>, the following definitions lead to a theorem proposed by him that lays the condition for preserving the interimage distance of an inter-distance matrix into the derived feature space. <p> In other words, (p; q) is the vector signature of a finite pseudometric space (P; ), if R (p;q) is a minimal pseudo-Euclidean vector space, within which (P; ) can be isometrically represented. This idea is illustrated in [3]. Isometric embedding ensures that there exists a distance preserving mapping <ref> [7] </ref>: Definition 2: Let (P; ) be the pseudometric space defined earlier and let V be a vector space over R of dimension k 1, and let fa i g 1ik1 be a basis of such a vector space.

Reference-contexts: Determining whether a quadratic form has a desired signature requires the use of results on symmetric bilinear forms on (P; ) and their connection to quadratic forms. The proof of Theorem 1 is given in <ref> [8] </ref>.
