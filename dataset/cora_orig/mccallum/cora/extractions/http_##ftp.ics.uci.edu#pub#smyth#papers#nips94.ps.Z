Abstract: In remote sensing applications "ground-truth" data is often used as the basis for training pattern recognition algorithms to generate thematic maps or to detect objects of interest. In practical situations, experts may visually examine the images and provide a subjective noisy estimate of the truth. Calibrating the reliability and bias of expert labellers is a non-trivial problem. In this paper we discuss some of our recent work on this topic in the context of detecting small volcanoes in Magellan SAR images of Venus. Empirical results (using the Expectation-Maximization procedure) suggest that accounting for subjective noise can be quite significant in terms of quantifying both human and algorithm detection performance.

Reference-contexts: For problem (ii), in previous work we have shown that when the inferred labels have a probabilistic interpretation, a simple mixture model argument leads to straightforward modifications of various learning algorithms <ref> [1] </ref>. It should be noted that the issue of inferring ground truth from subjective labels has appeared in the literature under various guises. French [2] provides a Bayesian perspective on the problem of combining multiple opinions.

In the field of medical diagnosis there is a significant body of work on latent variable models for inferring hidden "truth" from subjective diagnoses (e.g., see Uebersax <ref> [3] </ref>). More abstract theoretical models have also been developed under assumptions of specific labelling patterns (e.g., Lugosi [4] and references therein).

Reference-contexts: The Magellan Venus data set is a typical example: between 1991 and 1994 the Magellan spacecraft transmitted back to earth a data set consisting of over 30,000 high resolution (75m per pixel) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the Venusian surface <ref> [5] </ref>. This data set is greater than that gathered by all previous planetary missions combined | planetary scientists are literally swamped by data. There are estimated to be on the order of 10 6 small (less than 15km in diameter) visible volcanoes scattered throughout the 30,000 images [6].

It has been estimated that manually locating all of these volcanoes would require on the order of 10 man-years of a planetary geologist's time to carry out | our experience has been that even a few hours of image analysis severely taxes the concentration abilities of human labellers.

Reference-contexts: The ROCs shown here differ in two significant ways <ref> [11] </ref>: (1) the false alarm axis is normalized relative to the number of true positives (necessary since the total number of possible false alarms is not well defined for object detection in images), and (2) the reference labels used in scoring are probabilistic: a detection "scores" p (v) on the detection

Reference-contexts: For the volcano detection task a simple model for uncertainty in the class labels provided insight into the performance of both human and algorithmic detectors. An obvious extension of the maximum likelihood framework outlined here is a Bayesian approach <ref> [12] </ref>: accounting for parameter uncertainty in the model given the limited amount of training data available is worth investigating.
