Abstract: Simulated annealing (SA) is a stochastic technique for solving constraint satisfaction and optimisation problems. Research on SA usually focuses on neighbourhood operators and annealing schedules. While SA can theoretically converge to a global optimum with stationary distributions, this requires an exponential-time execution of the annealing algorithm; in practice only a short annealing schedule can be used. To devise an appropriate annealing schedule one must consider how much time to spend at high temperatures for approximating stationary distributions and how much time to spend at low temperatures for greedily approaching better solutions. Unfortunately these two things are always in conflict. Annealing schedules are problem dependent, and deciding a good one for a specific problem relies on empirical studies. This makes it difficult to balance the conflict. We argue that the process of balancing the conflict should be a dynamic procedure rather than a static one. We present a refined SA strategy that can adjust annealing schedules according to the solution distribution formed in past search. The basic idea is to divide the search space into disjoint subspaces which are then processed by a localized SA strategy. Different temperatures and annealing speeds can be maintained in the different subspaces depending upon certain evaluation criteria. To assess the performance of the proposed strategy, we apply it to two real-world applications: flight scheduling problems and freight train regrouping problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SA strategy is consistently better than standard SA.
