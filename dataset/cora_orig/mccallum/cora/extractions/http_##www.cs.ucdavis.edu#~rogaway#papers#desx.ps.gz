Abstract: The block cipher DESX is defined by DESX k:k1:k2 (x) = k2 DES k (k1 x), where denotes bitwise exclusive-or. This construction was first suggested by Rivest as a computationally-cheap way to protect DES against exhaustive key-search attacks. This paper proves, in a formal model, that the DESX construction is sound. We show that, when F is an idealized block cipher, FX k:k1:k2 (x) = k2 F k (k1 x) is substantially more resistant to key search than is F . In fact, our analysis says that FX has an effective key length of at least + n 1 lg m bits, where is the key length of F , n is the block length, and m bounds the number of hx; FX K (x)i pairs the adversary can obtain.

Reference-contexts: Here DES (i) denotes the i-th iterate of DES. Many authors have suggested methods to increase the strength of DES by changing its internal structure. Biham and Biryukov <ref> [1] </ref> give ways to modify DES to use key-dependent S-boxes. Their suggestions improve the cipher's strength against differential, linear, and improved Davies' attacks, as well as exhaustive key search.

Reference-contexts: This contrasts with the sort of machines which have been suggested in the past for doing brute-force attack: they do treat the underlying cipher as a black-box transformation. We note that while remarkable theoretical progress has been made on the linear and differential cryptanalysis of DES (see <ref> [2, 11] </ref>), thus far these attacks require an impractically large number of plaintext-ciphertext pairs.

Reference-contexts: To motivate our attack, we can view the FX block cipher as choosing a random key k and then applying the Even-Mansour construction to the function F k . We can therefore trivially adapt Daemen's chosen plaintext attack <ref> [5] </ref> on the Even-Mansour construction [7]. Unfortunately, we don't know the value of k, so we instead try all possible ones.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The susceptibility of DES to exhaustive key search has been a concern and a complaint since the cipher was first made public; see, for example, <ref> [6] </ref>. Careful analysis by Wiener [16] indicates that by 1994 the problem had escalated to the point where for $1 million one could build a DES key search engine that, given a hplaintext, ciphertexti pair, would recover the key in about 3.5 hours on average.

Reference-contexts: So focusing on the query complexity makes our results all the more meaningful. Likewise, the weakness of the adversary's goal only strengthens the lower bound. 1.3 Related work Even and Mansour <ref> [7] </ref> construct a block cipher PX : f0; 1g 2n fi f0; 1g n ! f0; 1g n from a random permutation P : f0; 1g n ! f0; 1g n by PX k1:k2 (x) = k2 P (k1 x). <p> Chosen-ciphertext attack. The definition we used models a chosen-plaintext attack. One could easily allow, as <ref> [7] </ref> did, a chosen-ciphertext attack: simply provide A an oracle for FX 1 (), 11 in addition to her oracle for FX (). In that case m would count the sum of the number of queries to the FX and FX 1 oracles, and Theorem 3.1 would continue to hold. <p> To motivate our attack, we can view the FX block cipher as choosing a random key k and then applying the Even-Mansour construction to the function F k . We can therefore trivially adapt Daemen's chosen plaintext attack [5] on the Even-Mansour construction <ref> [7] </ref>. Unfortunately, we don't know the value of k, so we instead try all possible ones.

Turning this around, the adversary needs 2 n+1lg m * queries to the F ()/F 1 () oracles to achieve an * advantage.

Reference-contexts: Key-search strategies can be quite sophisticated; recent work by <ref> [15] </ref> is an example. We want a model generous enough to permit sophisticated key-search strategies, but restricted enough to permit only strategies that should be regarded as key search. We accomplish this as follows. Let be the key length for a block cipher and let n be its block length.
