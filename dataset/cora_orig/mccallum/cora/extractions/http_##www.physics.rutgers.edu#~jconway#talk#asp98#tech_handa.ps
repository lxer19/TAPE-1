Abstract: We present a preliminary result from a search for walking technicolor particles using leptonically decayed W plus two jets with at least one b -tag using 109 7 pb 1 of data taken by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF). We search for technipion mass peaks in the invariant mass distribution of the two jet system and technirho mass peaks in the invariant mass distribution of W +2jet system. We do not see any significant excess in our search sample, and set 95 % confidence level upper limits on the production cross section and exclude a region of the T mass v.s. T mass plane.

Reference-contexts: Input parameters of the technicolor events in PYTHIA are all default values described in the TC model <ref> [2] </ref>. We generate 10k events for each T , T mass combination. These events are passed through the detector simulation. We choose about fifty mass combinations whose cross section is more than 5 pb. The acceptance and efficiencies are estimated using these Monte Carlo signal event samples.

Reference-contexts: Identification of b jets is done by reconstructing secondary vertices from b-quark decay using the Silicon Vertex Detector (SVX b-tagging). The SVX b-tagging algorithms are described in Ref. <ref> [3] </ref>. The number of selected events is 42, while the expected number of background events is 31.6 as shown in Table 1. II SIGNAL MONTE CARLO AND EFFICIENCIES Using PYTHIA 6.1 [4], we generate 0 T and p s = 1:8 TeV pp collisions.

Reference-contexts: IV TOPOLOGY AND MASS WINDOW CUTS The topology cuts are placed on the angle between two jets, (jj), and the P T of the dijet system, P T (jj) <ref> [5] </ref>. Our TC signal search region has a characteristic which is M ( T ) + M (W ) ' M ( T ). In this case, technipions are produced nearly at rest, and consequently the (jj) is more back-to-back than the background and P T (jj) is smaller.
