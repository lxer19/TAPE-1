Abstract: This paper is a revised version of an article by the same title and author which appeared in the April 1991 issue of Communications of the ACM. Abstract For the past few years, a joint ISO/CCITT committee known as JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) has been working to establish the first international compression standard for continuous-tone still images, both grayscale and color. JPEG's proposed standard aims to be generic, to support a wide variety of applications for continuous-tone images. To meet the differing needs of many applications, the JPEG standard includes two basic compression methods, each with various modes of operation. A DCT-based method is specified for lossy'' compression, and a predictive method for lossless'' compression. JPEG features a simple lossy technique known as the Baseline method, a subset of the other DCT-based modes of operation. The Baseline method has been by far the most widely implemented JPEG method to date, and is sufficient in its own right for a large number of applications. This article provides an overview of the JPEG standard, and focuses in detail on the Baseline method.

Reference-contexts: Some of the important applications that are already in the process of adopting JPEG compression or have stated their interest in doing so are Adobe's PostScript language for printing systems <ref> [1] </ref>, the Raster Content portion of the ISO Office Document Architecture and Interchange Format [13], the future CCITT color facsimile standard, and the European ETSI videotext standard [10]. 11 Standardization Schedule JPEG's ISO standard will be divided into two parts.

Reference-contexts: While this article provides many details, many more are necessarily omitted. The reader should refer to the ISO draft standard <ref> [2] </ref> before attempting implementation. Some of the earliest industry attention to the JPEG proposal has been focused on the Baseline sequential codec as a motion image compression method - of the ``intraframe'' class, where each frame is encoded as a separate image. <p> Such choices are the business of the applications which use JPEG; the JPEG proposal specifies no required Huffman tables. Huffman coding for the Baseline sequential encoder is described in detail in section 7. By contrast, the particular arithmetic coding method specified in the JPEG proposal <ref> [2] </ref> requires no tables to be externally input, because it is able to adapt to the image statistics as it encodes the image. (If desired, statistical conditioning tables can be used as inputs for slightly better efficiency, but this is not required.) Arithmetic coding has produced 5-10% better compression than Huffman <p> Figure 10 (b) shows (to one decimal place) the resulting DCT coefficients. Except for a few of the lowest frequency coefficients, the amplitudes are quite small. 11 luminance (grayscale) components included in the informational annex of the draft JPEG standard part 1 <ref> [2] </ref>. Figure 10 (d) shows the quantized DCT coefficients, normalized by their quantization table entries, as specified by equation (3). At the decoder these numbers are denormalized- according to equation (4), and input to the IDCT, equation (2). <p> Thus, the intermediate sequence of symbols for this example 8x8 block is: (2)(3), (1,2)(-2), (0,1)(-1), (0,1)(-1), Next the codes themselves must be assigned. For this example, the VLCs (Huffman codes) from the informational annex of <ref> [2] </ref> will be used. <p> 159 155 156 158 (f) reconstructed image samples 240 -14 0 0 0 -10 0 0 0 0 0 -13 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 coefficients coefficients 12 The VLIs specified in <ref> [2] </ref> are related to the two's complement representation. They are: (3) 11 (-1) 0 Thus, the bit-stream for this 8x8 example block is as follows. <p> Quantized DCT coefficients can be 4 bits larger, so the SIZE and AMPLITUDE information extend accordingly. DCT sequential with arithmetic coding is described in detail in <ref> [2] </ref>. 8 DCT Progressive Mode The DCT progressive mode of operation consists of the same FDCT and Quantization steps (from section 4) that are used by DCT sequential mode. The key difference is that each image component is encoded in multiple scans rather than in a single scan. <p> Part 1 <ref> [2] </ref> will specify the four modes of operation, the different codecs specified for those modes, and the interchange format. It will also contain a substantial informational section on implementation guidelines.

Reference-contexts: Part 1 [2] will specify the four modes of operation, the different codecs specified for those modes, and the interchange format. It will also contain a substantial informational section on implementation guidelines. Part 2 <ref> [3] </ref> will specify the compliance tests which will determine whether an encoder implementation, a decoder implementation, or a JPEG-compressed image in interchange format comply with the Part 1 specifications.

Reference-contexts: For applications in which these variables can be reasonably well defined, psychovisual experiments can be performed to determine the best thresholds. The experiment described in [12] has led to a set of Quantization Tables for CCIR-601 <ref> [4] </ref> images and displays. These have been used experimentally by JPEG members and will appear in the ISO standard as a matter of information, but not as a requirement. 4.3 DC Coding and Zig-Zag Sequence After quantization, the DC coefficient is treated separately from the 63 AC coefficients.

Reference-contexts: This step achieves additional compression losslessly by encoding the quantized DCT coefficients more compactly based on their statistical characteristics.

Reference-contexts: In June 1987, JPEG conducted a selection process based on a blind assessment of subjective picture quality, and narrowed 12 proposed methods to three. Three informal working groups formed to refine them, and in January 1988, a second, more rigorous selection process [19] revealed that the ADCT- proposal <ref> [11] </ref>, based on the 8x8 DCT, had produced the best picture quality. At the time of its selection, the DCT-based method was only partially defined for some of the modes of operation.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, no physical implementation can compute them with perfect accuracy. Because of the DCT's application importance and its relationship to the DFT, many different algorithms by which the FDCT and IDCT may be approximately computed have been devised <ref> [16] </ref>. Indeed, research in fast DCT algorithms is ongoing and no single algorithm is optimal for all implementations. What is optimal in software for a general-purpose CPU is unlikely to be optimal in firmware for a programmable DSP and is certain to be suboptimal for dedicated VLSI.

Reference-contexts: But compression technology alone is not sufficient. For digital image applications involving storage or transmission to become widespread in today's marketplace, a standard image compression method is needed to enable interoperability of equipment from different manufacturers. The CCITT recommendation for today's ubiquitous Group 3 fax machines <ref> [17] </ref> is a dramatic example of how a standard compression method can enable an important image application. The Group 3 method, however, deals with bilevel images only and does not address photographic image compression.
