Abstract: In this project, we proposed a distributed, adaptive, loop and deadlock-free routing protocol for Ad Hoc networks. The protocol presented has the following major properties: a route is constructed and maintained only when it is actually used; broken routes may be repaired locally with a novel microflooding-based mechanism; route construction procedure employs a new algorithm which can exercise the control of the

Corson et al proposed a distributed algorithms by finding shortest paths in weighted graphs [Corson]. 4. Perkins et al proposed Highly Dynamic DestinationSequence Distance-Vector Routing (DSDV) for Mobile Computers [Perkins]. <p> Since the topology in an Ad Hoc networks environment is expected to change very fast we decided to construct and maintain routes only as long as they are needed. As the prototype for route discovery we used Dynamic Source Routing Algorithm <ref> [Johnson] </ref>. Since we expected routes to change quite frequently, the main priority was to minimize the number of floodings used. <p> Microflooding presents clear bandwidth savings when the network size exceeds the microflooding coverage. Protocol Design 13 In the basic version of Dynamic Source Routing Algorithm proposed in <ref> [Johnson] </ref> every time a route is broken a flooding is used to reconstruct the route all over again. In our approach we try to repair a route locally and only in the case of the failure the whole route is rediscovered. <p> The heavily loaded nodes must insert intentional delay before forwarding. Subsequent analysis has shown that the intentional delay concept alone has a significant effect on the quality of the routes constructed. The forwarding strategy proposed in <ref> [Johnson] </ref>, which is purely based on the flooding algorithm, has an inherent property that the route versions available for comparison at the destination host are essentially the same except last few hops (as illustrated in the Fig 3.3.).The fastest version, which would dominate, is not necessarily the cheapest if, for instance, <p> To enhance load balancing we do not make use of the route information discovered by other hosts (as in <ref> [Johnson] </ref>). Uncontrolled usage of other nodes routes may lead to the routes constructed first collapsing, whereas other areas may remain underloaded. In our approach each host desiring a route would have to do its own route discovery. <p> Conclusions and Future Work 26 4.

Therefore, every route constructed would always be based on the most recent information of the load distribution pattern. We argue that the flooding forwarding policy used in <ref> [Johnson] </ref> will not always be able to produce routes close to optimal. The main deficiency is that the first version of the route constructed is not always the best and it will not allow slower alternatives to be constructed properly. <p> Future work The first priority would be to complete the evaluation of the protocol performance. We believe that the simplest version of the algorithm based on the microdiscovery will present significant bandwidth savings compared with flooding and the closest rival algorithm - Dynamic Source Routing Algorithm presented in <ref> [Johnson] </ref>. Optimizations introduced in the section 3.4.5 still need to be researched. We believe that a number of optimizations may be included into the main version. The protocol currently considers only peer to peer communication, though in a tactical environment multicast communication may be important.
