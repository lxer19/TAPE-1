Title: Graphs in Statistical Analysis: Is the Medium the Message?  
Author: R. Dennis Cook Sanford Weisberg 
Keyword: Key Words: Dimension-reduction subspaces, Scatterplot matrices, Regression, Regression graphics, Residual plots.  
Affiliation: Department of Applied Statistics University of Minnesota  
Abstract: In an influential article, Frank Anscombe (1973) remarked that "[m]ost textbooks on statistical methods, and most statistical computer programs, pay too little attention to graphs." This general observation no longer holds. Graphs of data are everywhere. Our children learn to draw and use bar charts in kindergarten; most newspapers and magazines regularly use graphical representation of data, and nearly all books on statistical methods use graphs. Graphs can be drawn in statistical packages, in spreadsheet programs, and in stand-alone graphics packages. Statisticians often bemoan the poor construction of the graphs produced, but even when the construction is adequate, graphs can be of little value. In this article, we suggest that useful graphs must have a context induced by associated theory, and that a graph without the well-understood statistical context is hardly worth drawing.

Reference-contexts: We can use our eyes to integrate the contents of many slices to visualize F (Y jX 1 ) as we move the slice from left to right, particularly if we concentrate on the mean function E (Y jX 1 ). Enhancements like mean smoothers <ref> (Altman, 1992, Hardle, 1990) </ref> and variance smoothers (Hardle and Tsybakov, 1988; Rup-pert, Wand, Holst and Hossjer, 1996) can help the visualization.

Reference-contexts: New problems, new graphical constructions and new insights about standard methodology all flow from the context that we have just sketched. For example, us-ing residual plots for model checking and for guidance on remedial action when appropriate seems to be common practice <ref> (see, for example, Atkinson 1985, and Cook and Weisberg 1982) </ref>. This typically involves iterating between residual plots and modifications of the model until the residual plots show reasonable agreement between the model and the data.

Reference-contexts: We noted several different characterizations of the individual plots in the scatterplot matrix of Figure 1. The characterization of Figure 2 is more focused, and is one of standard characterization options for residual plots. Other types of graphs, such as histograms, boxplots, 3D rotating plots and trellis displays <ref> (Becker, Cleveland and Shyu 1996) </ref>, may have their own language and methodology for characterization. For example, characterization of 3D rotating plots has often been done in terms of outliers, clusters and "unusual structures" (Huber 1987), but how these characterizations can be related to the regression problem is unclear.

Reference-contexts: graph without understanding the context are likely to be wrong, or off the point at best. 1.1 Scatterplot matrices The scatterplot matrix of Figure 1 shows measurements on four potential predictors, X = (L; W; H; S) T of Y =Mass, the mass of the edible part of a mussel <ref> (from Cook and Weisberg, 1994, Sec. 10.4) </ref>. Except for the diagonal, each cell in the matrix is a 2D scatterplot. The names on the diagonal serve to name the axes of each of the twenty 2D scatterplots. <p> Equation (3) is satisfied approximately for many other distributions as well. Transformations of predictors can be used to make the initial choice of X closer to satisfying this assumption, and weighting is possible as well <ref> (Cook and Nachtsheim 1994) </ref>. We return now to residual plots. If d = 1 and condition (3) holds to a reasonable approximation, the fan-shaped pattern in Figure 2 indicates that Var (Y jX) is non-constant (Cook and Weisberg 1994, Chap. 7). <p> We return now to residual plots. If d = 1 and condition (3) holds to a reasonable approximation, the fan-shaped pattern in Figure 2 indicates that Var (Y jX) is non-constant <ref> (Cook and Weisberg 1994, Chap. 7) </ref>. If either condition (3) fails or d &gt; 1, then a fan-shaped pattern need not correspond to non-constant variance in the regression problem.

Reference-contexts: The intersection is always a sub-space, but it is not necessarily a dimension-reduction subspace. When S yjx is a dimension-reduction subspace it is called the central dimension-reduction subspace for F (Y jX), or simply the central subspace <ref> (Cook 1996) </ref>. We restrict attention to regression problems in which the central subspace exists.

Reference-contexts: F (X 1 ) and F (Y ) and the joint distribution F (X 1 ; Y ) can be inferred from a 2D scat-terplot, other displays show these distributions more directly, such as histograms or density estimates for the marginals, and a 2D density estimate for the joint distribution <ref> (Scott, 1992) </ref>. and X 1 . How exactly do we "see" the conditional distribution of Y jX 1 in this graph? Conditioning on X 1 means looking at narrow vertical slices in the plot.

Reference-contexts: If the number of predictors in this problem were p = 1, then the pattern in Figure 2 would indicate that E (Y jX = x) is a linear function of x, and that the variance of Y E (Y jX = x) increases with x <ref> (Weisberg, 1985, p. 133) </ref>. If p &gt; 1, non-constant variance could cause a pattern like the one in Figure 2, but is this the only possible cause of the pattern? If so, then the graph is a useful statistical construction. <p> New problems, new graphical constructions and new insights about standard methodology all flow from the context that we have just sketched.
