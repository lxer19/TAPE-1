Reference-contexts: The Scheme Machine implements a slight variation of this virtual machine. This project started in the spring of 1993 with some informal meetings held by Steve Johnson. Peter Weingartner and I learned about the Digital Design Derivation (DDD) system <ref> [1] </ref> and began to transform the software CPU I designed in the C511 course into a form acceptable to DDD. In the summer of 1993 I worked on the Scheme Machine for C890 credit under Steve Johnson.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This report describes the design and implementation of the Scheme Machine CPU. In chapter 12 of Essentials of Programming Languages <ref> [2] </ref>, a simple CPS Scheme interpreter is transformed into a compiler and a virtual machine with very specialized, Scheme-specific instructions. The Scheme Machine implements a slight variation of this virtual machine. This project started in the spring of 1993 with some informal meetings held by Steve Johnson.
