Abstract: A framework for the modelling and specification of logistic systems is presented. This framework is based on a hierarchical high-level Petri net model. Within this framework we developed a language, called ExSpect, to specify systems in terms of this Petri net model. This specification language is supported by a software package, also called ExSpect, which facilitates the modelling and analysis of complex dynamic systems. We have modelled and analysed many logistic systems with ExSpect ([5]). Most of these applications resulted from the TASTE project ([3]). These practical experiences show that there is a need for a method to facilitate the modelling of complex logistic systems. We propose a systematic method, which is presented in this paper. This method is based on a complete taxonomy of the goods and information flows inside a logistic system. Based on this taxonomy we have developed a toolkit of standard logistical components that can be combined graphically, thus yielding an ExSpect specification which can be used to analyse the logistic system under consideration.

Reference-contexts: It is our belief that many practical logistic systems can be modelled using these building blocks. This modelling process is supported by software (ExSpect) and results in a specification that can be analysed using simulation or one of the analysis methods described in <ref> [1] </ref> and [2]. 2 A SYSTEMS VIEW OF LOGISTICS A logistic process consists of the flow of goods and services and the monitoring and control of these flows. Typical activities include: transportation, inventory management, order processing, warehousing, distribution and production. <p> To specify complex logistic systems it is useful to extend the Petri net model with time. We use a rather new timing concept, where "time" is in tokens. See van Hee et al. [8] and van der Aalst <ref> [1] </ref>, [2] for more information. An important advantage of using a formalism based on Petri nets, is the fact that we can use all kinds of analysis methods developed for Petri nets. <p> If we want to inspect the reachability graph by means of a computer, we have to solve this problem. This is the reason we have developed several reduction techniques, see <ref> [1] </ref> and [2]. The language ExSpect consists of two parts: a functional part and a dynamic part. The functional part is used to define types and functions needed to describe operations on the value of a token. <p> It is also possible to interact with some external applications, for example presentation software. Recently we added the ITPN Analysis Tool (IAT) to ExSpect. This tool translates a specification into an interval timed Petri net which is analysed using the methods described in <ref> [1] </ref>. The tool also allows for more traditional kinds of analysis such as the generation of place and transition invariants. 4 A LOGISTIC LIBRARY We have modelled (specified) many logistic systems. These practical experiences show that these logistic systems have subsystems which have a lot in common.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the pilot projects showed that existing simulation tools are either to specific (special purpose simulation packages) or to general (general purpose simulation languages). Since ExSpect combines the advantages of special purpose simulation packages and general purpose simulation languages, TASTE started to use ExSpect in 1988. See <ref> [3] </ref> for more information. The TASTE project faced the fact that research in the field of logistics developed along two separate lines. The first line concentrates on solving mathematical problems related to logistics. Often the problem statement is simplified to allow for analytical solutions.

Reference-contexts: a systematic approach to production planning and control (e.g. <ref> [6] </ref>,[7]). In Biemans [7] an attempt was made to structure manufacturing planning and control using a `reference model', i.e. a representation of an idealized production organization, defining the tasks of the components as well as the interactions between the components. In [6], Bertrand, Wortmann and Wijngaard provide a number of general concepts for the design of production control systems. This paper presents a "systems view of logistics" to be able to deal with the growing complexity of the control problems in logistics.

Reference-contexts: Logistic management is concerned with the development of functions to support these activities. A simplified definition of logistics is: "The process of having the right quantity of the right item in the right place at the right time" (Hutchinson <ref> [10] </ref>). In the area of logistics many books are available, nearly all of which deal with the control and design of production, inventory and transport systems. Some of these books concentrate on solving mathematical problems related to logistics. Often the problem statement is simplified to allow for analytical solutions.

Reference-contexts: Many authors have extended the basic Petri net model with coloured or typed tokens (e.g. Jensen <ref> [11] </ref>, van Hee et al. [8]). In these models tokens have a value, often referred to as colour. There are several reasons for such an extension. One reason is the fact that (uncoloured) Petri nets tend to become too large to handle. <p> An interesting way to analyse a coloured Petri net is to calculate (or verify) place and transition invariants (P and T-invariants). Place and transition invariants can be used to prove properties of the modelled system (see Jensen <ref> [11] </ref>). Intuitively, a place invariant assigns a weight to each token such that the weighted sum of all tokens in the net remains constant during the execution of any firing sequence. By calculating these place invariants we find a set of equations which characterizes all reachable states. <p> Transition invariants are the duals of place invariants and the main objective of calculating transition invariants is to find firing sequences with no `effects'. Reachability analysis is a technique which constructs a reachability graph, sometimes referred to as reachability tree or occurrence graph (Jensen <ref> [11] </ref>, Murata [14]). Such a reachability graph contains a node for each possible state and an arc for each possible state change. Reachability analysis is a very powerful method in the sense that it can be used to prove all kinds of properties.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION High-level Petri nets have been used in many application areas, e.g. flexible manufacturing, computer architecture, distributed information systems, protocols, etc. In <ref> [12] </ref> there are a number of papers describing applications of high-level nets. ExSpect is a specification language based on a timed high-level Petri net model. ExSpect also has a hierarchical construct called system.

Reference-contexts: This Markov chain can be used to calculate performance measures like the average number of tokens in a place and the average firing rate of a transition (see Ajmone Marsan <ref> [13] </ref>). Structural analysis There are several kinds of structural analysis, by which it is possible to prove that a given Petri net has a set of desired properties (e.g. absence of traps and deadlocks, boundedness, liveness, invariance, etc.).

Reference-contexts: ExSpect is based on a timed coloured Petri net model, i.e. a Petri net model extended with time and "coloured" tokens. The classic (or basic) Petri net is a directed labelled bipartite graph with two node types called places and transitions (see Murata <ref> [14] </ref>). The nodes are connected via labelled arcs. Connections between two nodes of the same type are not allowed. Places are represented by circles, transitions by bars. A place p is called an input place of a transition t if there exists a directed arc from p to t. <p> Transition invariants are the duals of place invariants and the main objective of calculating transition invariants is to find firing sequences with no `effects'. Reachability analysis is a technique which constructs a reachability graph, sometimes referred to as reachability tree or occurrence graph (Jensen [11], Murata <ref> [14] </ref>). Such a reachability graph contains a node for each possible state and an arc for each possible state change. Reachability analysis is a very powerful method in the sense that it can be used to prove all kinds of properties.

Reference-contexts: Existing techniques which can be used to analyse timed coloured Petri nets, may be subdivided into four classes: Simulation is a technique to analyse a system by conducting controlled experiments (see Shannon <ref> [15] </ref>). These experiments are used to verify the correctness of the model and to predict the behaviour of the system under consideration. Because simulation does not require difficult mathematical techniques, it is easy to understand for people with a non-technical background.
