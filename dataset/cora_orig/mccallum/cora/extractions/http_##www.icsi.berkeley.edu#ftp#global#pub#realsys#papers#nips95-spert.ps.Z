Abstract: We report on our development of a high-performance system for neural network and other signal processing applications. We have designed and implemented a vector microprocessor and packaged it as an attached processor for a conventional workstation. We present performance comparisons with commercial workstations on neural network backpropagation training. The SPERT-II system demonstrates significant speedups over extensively hand optimization code running on the workstations.

Reference-contexts: While the T0 application runs, the server services I/O requests on behalf of the T0 process. 4 Related Systems Several programmable digital neurocomputers have been constructed, most notably systems based on the CNAPS chip from Adaptive Solutions <ref> (Hammerstrom, 1990) </ref> and the SYNAPSE-1, based on the MA-16 chip from Siemens (Ramacher, 1991). The Adaptive Solutions CNAPS-1064 chip contains a SIMD array with 64 16-bit processing elements (PEs) per chip. Systems require an external microcode sequencer.

Reference-contexts: The most significant change we have made to the architecture is to move to a vector instruction set architecture (ISA), based on the industry standard MIPS RISC scalar ISA <ref> (Kane, 1992) </ref> extended with vector coprocessor instructions. The resulting ISA, which we call Torrent, offers important advantages over our previous design. We gain access to existing software tools for the MIPS architecture, including optimizing C compilers, assemblers, linkers, and debuggers.

The Adaptive Solutions CNAPS-1064 chip contains a SIMD array with 64 16-bit processing elements (PEs) per chip. Systems require an external microcode sequencer. The PEs have 16-bit datapaths with a single 32-bit accumulator, and are less flexible than the T0 datapaths.
