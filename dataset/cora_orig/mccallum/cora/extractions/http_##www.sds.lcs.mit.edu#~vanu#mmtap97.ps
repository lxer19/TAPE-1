Abstract: Traditional multimedia systems deal with only a few basic media: text, graphics, audio and video. However, many other types of media, such as ultrasound, infrared and RF signals, can be represented by streams of data samples and processed within multimedia applications. In this paper, we introduce some of these new media domains and identify interesting opportunities enabled by their software-based processing. We also describe our SpectrumWare testbed for experimenting with these new media types and report on our experience to date. We believe that the time has come to broaden the scope of `multimedia' to include any form of sampled information. Advances in processor and analog-to-digital conversion technology have brought raw sample streams within the grasp of desktop computers and media processing systems. Coupling these new media types with software-based processing allows the construction of virtual devices that can handle different sample sources, modify their behavior based on information extracted from the media, and transform information between media domains.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Today's multimedia systems greatly enhance the user's ability to interact with the environment and with other users at remote locations. Furthermore, as processing power has increased, many media-specific functions are now realized in software. For example, software codecs [Tur93] and image compressors <ref> [AMV96] </ref> perform signal processing that has fl fvanu,agchiu,dltg@lcs.mit.edu. http://www.sds.lcs.mit.edu/ vanu g traditionally been implemented in custom hardware. This software-based media processing allows applications to make decisions based on the content of the media and to alter their behavior appropriately, thereby enhancing the functionality and flexibility of the overall system.

Reference-contexts: one such test instrument, an oscilloscope, which demonstrates some of this flexibility. 2.3 Radio Frequency Signals A tremendous amount of information is available via radio frequency signals: broadcast information, such as radio and television, point to point communications like cellular telephony, and position information from the GPS and Loran systems <ref> [Get93] </ref>. As processor speeds continue to increase, wider bands of RF and more sophisticated modulation and coding schemes will come within the grasp of desktop computers, enabling them to incorporate these rich sources of information.

Reference-contexts: This section describes the testbed and some of the prototype applications that have been constructed. The backbone of our prototyping environment for virtual devices is the VuNet <ref> [HAI + 95] </ref>, an ATM desk area network. Data is captured using network-based appliances, with transducers for RF signals (e.g. AM radio and cellular telephony) as well as conventional baseband audio and video. These signals are processed on hosts (DEC workstations) distributed 4 around the network.

Reference-contexts: Data is captured using network-based appliances, with transducers for RF signals (e.g. AM radio and cellular telephony) as well as conventional baseband audio and video. These signals are processed on hosts (DEC workstations) distributed 4 around the network. We have also developed a PCI bus <ref> [Ism] </ref> adapter that allows the same appliances to be directly connected to a PCI-based host and take advantage of the 1 Gbps data transfer rate directly into application accessible memory. The network appliances, shown in figure 4, have two components: a generic network adaptor and an application-specific daughter card. <p> The resulting RF data is then transmitted to a General Purpose PCI Interface (GuPPI) <ref> [Ism] </ref> which transfers the data to a D/A converter connected to an antenna. On the receive side, the digitized RF signal is demodulated and de-framed, resulting in IP packets which are then passed down to the IP layer for further processing or routing.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 presents the SpectrumWare testbed for wideband sample processing [TB96] and the adaptation of an earlier multimedia programming environment <ref> [LT96] </ref> for use with a number of types of sampled information. We conclude with a discussion of the opportunities and challenges that these new media types present to the multimedia community. 2 Application Domains Virtual devices encompass a wide range of potential applications. <p> This approach allows specific devices to be rapidly prototyped for very low cost, since the only application-specific daughter card needs to be customized. The programming environment is based on the VuSystem <ref> [LT96] </ref>, which has demonstrated the feasibility of a software-based approach to conventional media, including audio, video, text and graphics.

A virtual radio, coupled with a true multiband front end <ref> [LU95] </ref>, would allow emulation of many different radios without any dedicated hardware. Many wireless networks, such as WaveLAN [Tuc93] utilize the 900 MHz ISM band. With a 900 MHz wideband receiver, or a multiband front end, a virtual radio would be capable of interacting with many different wireless networks.

Reference-contexts: Memory and I/O Recent improvements in memory, I/O and network technologies have made the acquisition of many wideband signals feasible. The memory interface of new DEC Axp chips (21164) has a maximum pin bandwidth of 1.6 GB/sec <ref> [PS96] </ref>. The I/O system of a standard PCI-based workstation supports a transfer rate over 1 Gbps, with planned extension up to 4 Gbps. Finally, commercially available ATM networks run at an OC-12 rate of 622 Mbps.

Reference-contexts: Image processing applications work with the same media sources (e.g. a camera) as video player applications, and thus the bandwidth requirements are similar. However, image processing applications such as face finding <ref> [RBK95] </ref> require significantly more computation than simply capturing the data and assembling it into video frames. Desktop processors can exploit parallelism by using their 64 and 128 bit wide buses, pipelining and multiple instruction paths to increase the available computational power per sample.

Reference-contexts: However, these features are not fundamental barriers to signal processing in a workstation environment <ref> [SPL92] </ref>.. The key observation is that unpredictable timing events, such as interrupts and cache misses are not specified in units of time, but in units of clock cycles. As processor speeds increase, the absolute amount of time required to service these events decreases, making real-time processing more tractable.
