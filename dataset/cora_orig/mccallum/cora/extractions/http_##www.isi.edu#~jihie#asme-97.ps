Abstract: The exponential growth of the Internet and the increasing communication and computational power have created many opportunities for advancing engineering, manufacturing and business activities. Active Catalog brings a conceptually new idea to design and electronic commerce by providing new forms of catalog information about engineering parts and physical objects. Active Catalog is designed for finding and using information in building design applications in the context of heterogeneous, Internet-based distributed computing environments. The information provided by Active Catalog is active, dynamic, composable, multi-dimensional, share-able, semantically accessible, interoperable and executable in distributed environments. This paper presents a number of research issues and our approach in building an Internet-based catalog information resource. The paper describes an initial prototype toward realizing the "Try Before You Buy" paradigm, in the context of the electromechanical design of pump and motor systems. The prototype contains a pump ontology and a search engine for finding seman

Reference-contexts: The database that stores the information can be distributed in the Internet. Also, the search engine can access up-to-date information over the net. Active Catalog uses SIMS <ref> (Arens et al. 1993) </ref>, as its knowledge-based search engine. SIMS is an intermediate layer a mediator between information sources and human applications programs. Queries to SIMS are in a uniform language, independent of the distribution of information sources, the query languages, and the locations of sources, etc.

Reference-contexts: Although it provides KL-One like inference services and powerful graphical capabilities, Mediator focuses on accessing remote files and applications rather than on helping users to access, evaluate, and consume information in distributed task environments. STEP (the Standard for Exchange of Product Model Data) <ref> (Fowler 1995) </ref> builds an environment for engineering collaboration for engineering data exchange. It can be used for Internet simulations of mechanical systems design. By building Active Catalog on STEP, we can accomplish industrial enterprise integration: concurrent engineering and virtual enterprises.

Reference-contexts: Because modules are in Java, they can be executed on different machines. Furthermore, the multi-thread nature of Java can facilitate the parallel computation and synchronization of Active Catalog modules. Active Catalog will also make use of current research in high performance computation, such as PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) <ref> (Geist et.al. 1994) </ref> MPI (Message Passing Interface) (Gropp et.al. 1994), and load balancing mechanisms to distribute parallel executions. Furthermore, an intelligent scheduling mechanism based on contract nets for negotiating and allocating computing resource is planned.

In the next two sections, we will describe how to find catalog information and how to use it in engineering design.

Reference-contexts: It provides a template for expanding into a much richer and detailed network depending on the need of an application, and the network is sharable across domains. Currently, the semantic network in Active Catalog is modeled in Loom (MacGregor 1990) <ref> (MacGregor 1994) </ref>, a knowledge representation system language and environ 6 Copyright c fl 1997 by ASME Table 1.

Reference-contexts: The pump ontology and its semantic network had 300 classes of pumps, 3000 attributes and took three months to build. To support building domain ontologies and incremental development of a shared ontology, Active Catalog is using Ontosaurus <ref> (Swartout et. al. 96) </ref>, a web-based ontology editor. Knowledge-based Search Engine Active Catalog provides high level search by insulating users and user queries from the details of the information sources, including the physical locations of the sources, their query language, organization, etc.

Reference-contexts: The mechanical de-signer, in particular, needs simulation systems in addition to the more usual drafting system. Design environments must provide the designer with, in addition to traditional tools, libraries and catalogs of reusable components in relevant design domains <ref> (Will 1991) </ref>. AUTODESK's Parts Library (PartSpec) for drawings of mechanical parts and Smart-Model Library (PartSpec) for circuit design are examples. Currently the Internet offers the possibility of the designer replacing his/her set of filing cabinets of component literature with a rich web of component data provided electronically.
