Reference-contexts: A representation is necessary if the system is to be able to assign a preposition to an object pair. The semantic representation, to be discussed in this chapter, captures the vital properties sufficient for a succinct use of the chosen prepositions <ref> [ Abella and Kender, 1993 ] </ref> . The spatial prepositions can be encoded fairly concisely because objects are treated as "blobs" and because most of the properties characterized by these prepositions can be encoded using geometric properties such as alignment and distance.

Reference-contexts: The aim of this dissertation is to create a computational understanding of spatial prepositions that integrates visual and linguistic ideas and to use that understanding to generate descriptions of images from two domains 1 2 their integration using natural language <ref> [ Abella and Kender, 1994a ] </ref> . The two domains are landmark navigation and description generation of abnormal densities from radiographs of the urinary system. The text generated should resemble descriptions normally found in the domains by using knowledge that has been built into the system.

Reference-contexts: We will also demonstrate how the language generation preprocessor adheres to the appropriate medical terminology when generating descriptions. Several examples will be given to illustrate the results of the image processing and language generation preprocessor <ref> [ Abella and Kender, 1994b ] </ref> . 7.1 Introduction The goal of this task is to describe renal stones found in radiographs the precise goal of a radiologist examining an X-ray.

Reference-contexts: The general consensus among those who have conducted experiments in this area, is that infants up to about a year in age use geometrical landmarks to localize objects after a change in position or orientation. <ref> [ Acredolo and Evans, 1980 ] </ref> showed that the more prominent the landmarks the more effective they were as references in searching for a target object. Without a landmark the infants' behavior is primarily egocentric, localized with reference to the subject's own body.

Reference-contexts: In the paper [ Bremner, 1978 ] , the belief that infants use visual cues to code object positions, like the color of the background that the object is placed on, is addressed. In work conducted in <ref> [ Acredolo, 1978 ] </ref> , however, it was shown that infants under eleven months of age make no use whatever of visual referents to position.

Reference-contexts: An example of the fourth case is "A car appeared from over the hill". The directional expression is from over the hill with over the hill being a directional-locative expression, hence the categorization directional-locative-directional. Yet another study in prepositions by <ref> [ Becker and Arms, 1969 ] </ref> argues that prepositions share many features with verbs and may be represented at an abstract level of grammar as predicates. Also related to the study of prepositions is the study of preposition stranding.

Reference-contexts: if we accept the notion that we may approximate object shape and the environment in which they occur when using spatial expressions. 27 Other Work There are various other studies related in some form or other to English prepositions and the following few paragraphs will touch upon some of them. <ref> [ Bennett, 1968 ] </ref> discusses the question of synonymy within the framework of a stratifica-tional theory of language taking as examples prepositions.

Reference-contexts: Bennett studies the synonymous nature of prepositions by looking at language from this stratificational point of view. Another piece of work by Bennett, <ref> [ Bennett, 1972 ] </ref> , is concerned with what Ben-nett terms locative-directional distinction. Bennett presents a four-way classification of spatial expressions according to the complexity of their internal structure.

Reference-contexts: Wishart and Bower feel that spatial understanding matures when an infant learns to overcome the tendency to use egocentric rather than geographic referents for spatial position. In the paper <ref> [ Bremner, 1978 ] </ref> , the belief that infants use visual cues to code object positions, like the color of the background that the object is placed on, is addressed.

Reference-contexts: The question raised by Landau and Stecker is how and when do children learn to generalize objects to points, volumes and boundaries when using prepositions. Clark in <ref> [ Clark, 1977 ] </ref> performed various experiments on infants to test their understanding of the spatial relation conveyed by certain prepositions.

Reference-contexts: They use the occupancy array to retrieve information such as shape, relative distance, and relative size. We can find the study and use of spatial expressions in the area of machine translation. In <ref> [ Dorr and Voss, 1993 ] </ref> their primary interest is in the translation of natural language sentences where the sentence contains a spatial relation, in particular when the meaning being conveyed relates to the location or path of an object in the real world. <p> In summary <ref> [ Dorr and Voss, 1993 ] </ref> have used spatial expression as an example to illustrate their method for defining the relation between the interlingua, and the knowledge representation components of a machine translation system.

The closest area is suggested by <ref> [ Fox and Walker, 1989 ] </ref> . They believe that a useful role of computers in medicine is for imaging systems to be combined with methods for interpreting clinical data.

Reference-contexts: Winograd realizes that in order to devise a model for language understanding that is more complete and psychologically more intuitive requires that we learn how complex systems are organized. We find a much less philosophical view of AI in <ref> [ Glasgow and Papadias, 1992 ] </ref> than in [ Winograd, 1972 ] .

Reference-contexts: For example, "The ball kept rolling along the green". This expression makes us think that there is no obstruction and there is some force acting on the ball causing it to move. In <ref> [ Herskovits, 1986 ] </ref> her primary inquiry involves what she calls decoding and encoding. Decoding asks the question of whether a locative expression will convey its meaning predictably. Encoding asks the question of whether given two objects can an appropriate expression be found to express their spatial relation. <p> Encoding asks the question of whether given two objects can an appropriate expression be found to express their spatial relation. These two questions are also covered in this thesis and a model for answering these questions is demonstrated. In <ref> [ Herskovits, 1986 ] </ref> there are four components associated with decoding and encoding They are : use types, geometric description function, tolerance shift and sense shift. A use type corresponds to various classes of uses, for a preposition, distinguished by different conventions.

Reference-contexts: Yet another study in prepositions by [ Becker and Arms, 1969 ] argues that prepositions share many features with verbs and may be represented at an abstract level of grammar as predicates. Also related to the study of prepositions is the study of preposition stranding. Takami in <ref> [ ichi Takami, 1992 ] </ref> discusses preposition stranding and gives as some examples, "Who do you talk about the problem with?", and "Last night was difficult to sleep through". The prepositions with and through are the stranded prepositions. It is generally believed that stranded prepositions are colloquial in style.

Reference-contexts: The preciseness that Zernik and Vivier claim cause problems with the geometrical approach will be relaxed in order to gain more flexibility in using the locatives. We can again find reference to the need for a connection between vision and language in <ref> [ Jackendoff, 1987b ] </ref> . In this book Jackendoff states that one of the fundamental problems for a theory of natural language is in how we talk about what we see. In order to accomplish this some connection must be found between 38 language and vision.

Reference-contexts: These few examples already bring to light the difficulties of describing spatial relations. Language can be quite ambiguous and to chose an appropriate description for any particular spatial relation can be quite challenging, if not at times impossible. Jackendoff in <ref> [ Jackendoff, 1992 ] </ref> cites several primary complications associated with using English prepositions, all of which are acknowledged in the previous discussion about this research area.

Reference-contexts: The next easiest pair was top-bottom, over-under, and then above-below. In summary, Clark believes that the child's nonlinguistic organizational preferences appear to play an important role in predetermining what words are more easily acquired by the child. We find that in <ref> [ J.Piaget and Inhelder, 1956 ] </ref> the analysis of children's development of spatial representations is a topological one.

Reference-contexts: Note that in worst case this method has the same complexity as Boolean formula minimization, but in the average case the complexity is possibly lower, since descriptions tend to be short. Another alternative to Boolean formula minimization algorithm would be to perform the fuzzy minimization described in <ref> [ Kandel and Lee, 1979 ] </ref> for fuzzy logic circuits. Chapter 5 Inference Network Minimization In chapter 4 we were living in a novice world, where the goal was to establish a better understanding of the environment by generating descriptions of as many object pairs as necessary.

Reference-contexts: This leads to experimenters again to believe in egocentrism. Understanding spatial relations is a problem for a young infant in that it is difficult for them to understand the interrelations of positions in space.

Reference-contexts: We used the method aforementioned because we had the existing software to implement it and it yielded positive results. Locating the stones. To locate the stones we use the technique sketched out in <ref> [ Kimme et al., February 1975 ] </ref> for circle finding. Since a majority of the stones are circular in nature we may use this technique. The principle behind the technique is the hough transform.

Reference-contexts: As we well know, prepositions are inherently vague in their descriptions, and their interpretation may vary from person to person. Because of this, it is important to add some fuzzifying agent to our ideal set. The fuzzifying technique is as defined through fuzzy set theory <ref> [ Klir and Folger, 1988 ] </ref> . The theory of fuzzy sets is used to represent uncertainty, contrary to the theory of classical sets 2 which represents certainty.

Reference-contexts: They feel that expert systems can be used to integrate imaging techniques with tools for clinical decision making and problem solving. Fox favors programs that can accept pixel arrays and output explicitly symbolic descriptions. More along the lines of medical imaging systems can be found in <ref> [ Kobashi and Shapiro, 1992 ] </ref> .

The big debate in the study of imagery is in whether or not we actually think and represent ideas using mental images. This controversy in known as the imageless thought controversy.

Reference-contexts: Robot navigation, can surely benefit from an integration of vision and language. To do so, however, robot navigation needs to be approached from a more qualitative angle. Robot navigation has traditionally been quantitative, but the following pieces of work approach navigation from a more qualitative point of view. In <ref> [ Kuipers and Levitt, 1988 ] </ref> , and [ Kuipers, 1978 ] we read about three models for robot navigation built upon the knowledge that map learning and navigation consists of a sensorimotor, procedural, topological and metrical assemblage.

Miller and Johnson note that architects have probably collected more data about the ways that people talk about space than psychologists and linguists. One such person is Lynch in <ref> [ Lynch, 1960 ] </ref> . Lynch developed a spatial and geographical representation for what people told him about cities that they knew. Lynch noted that what he needed to represent were landmarks, paths, edges, districts, and nodes.

Reference-contexts: In this book Jackendoff states that one of the fundamental problems for a theory of natural language is in how we talk about what we see. In order to accomplish this some connection must be found between 38 language and vision. In <ref> [ Macnamara, 1978 ] </ref> , Macnamara points out that in order to talk about what we see, information provided by the visual system must be translated into a form compatible with the information used by the language system. Jackendoff realizes that much of spatial thinking depends on aspects of both.

Reference-contexts: In it young children begin the task of representing space in topological terms, then advance to an understanding of Euclidean and projective information and then finally rely on the use of coordinate axes and metric information. Mandler in, <ref> [ Mandler, 1988 ] </ref> , on the other hand, feels that there are two alternatives to this hypothesis that are more appropriate for explaining a child's development of spatial representations.

Reference-contexts: each of these areas to create a system that will meet some of the large demands imposed by all three research areas. 2.1 A Psychological Perspective Psychologists seem to be interested in how we simplify spatial information, how we represent it, how we manipulate it, and how we communicate it. <ref> [ Miller and Johnson-Laird, 1976 ] </ref> gives some examples of how people communicate it, and how it differs among different languages. <p> Perhaps the time difference in naming the object as opposed to just naming the location can be attributed to the link that must be traversed in going from the "what" system to the "where" system. In the book, <ref> [ Miller and Johnson-Laird, 1976 ] </ref> , we can find an extensive look at language and perception. In it they note how we have tried to abstract a formal concept of space from our experiences of it, and this has led to two theories, relative and absolute.

Reference-contexts: Jackendoff realizes that much of spatial thinking depends on aspects of both. In <ref> [ Mukerjee and Joe, 1990 ] </ref> we again find reference to spatial relations as they are used for creating spatial maps of an environment.

Reference-contexts: The topological agent is used to represent features from the environment as well as the relationships of these objects. The metric agent is needed to describe the magnitude of actions, such as the distance of travel. <ref> [ Park, 1993 ] </ref> also approaches 39 navigation from a qualitative point of view, and uses the notion of a sensorimotor and procedural agent. The focus is in navigating in a large unstructured environment where the focus of attention is on the navigator and map-maker.

A similar paper is <ref> [ Selfridge and Prewitt, 1981 ] </ref> that describes two boundary-delineating algorithms for detecting kidneys in tomographic images. The first algorithm operates on the entire image in order to establish an initial segmentation and the second allows for 149 the incorporation of anatomical knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Or equivalently if their bounding boxes overlap then the two objects are near. Miller and Johnson, stipulate that our concept of space and how objects in it are related to each other depends on our motility in it. As Urban in <ref> [ Urban, 1939 ] </ref> notes our intellect is primarily fitted to deal with space and moves most easily in this medium. Thus language itself becomes spatialized, and in so far as reality is represented by language, reality tends to be spa tialized.

Reference-contexts: One asserts that infants relate to objects in their environment in an egocentric manner (meaning that they view themselves in relation to an object rather than recognizing the interaction between objects). The other school believes that infants can indeed relate objects to each other spatially. In <ref> [ Wishart and Bower, 1982 ] </ref> they advocate the egocentric school of thought. They conclude that infants have an enormous difficulty in understanding the spatial relations of objects up until at least two years of age.
