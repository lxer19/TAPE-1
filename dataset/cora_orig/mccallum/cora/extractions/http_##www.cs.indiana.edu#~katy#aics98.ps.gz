Title: Concept-based, adaptive human-computer interaction

Abstract: Aiming at intelligent interfaces this paper describes research on human-computer interaction (HCI) that is based on concepts and evolves during the systems usage. The concepts are extracted out of past user interactions utilizing the approach of Conceptual Analogy [Bor97]. They are used to assist navigation and manipulation tasks visually and acoustically at increasing levels of generalization. Here we motivate the concept-based approach, describe the adaptive HCI that can be achieved with it, and exemplify the approach in an abstract domain.

Reference-contexts: Paths and object arrangements are represented by sets of places/objects (subsequently denoted by x) and the temporal/spatial relations (e.g., 'place 1 before place 2' or 'object 1 below object 2') among them: example ( (x_1, ..., x_n), (&lt;x_1,x_2&gt;, ..., &lt;x_n-1,x_n&gt;) ) The temporal/spatial relations may conform to Allens relations <ref> [All84] </ref>. For navigation/manipulation support past examples have to be combined. Solutions sharing many relations with past examples are preferred. Case-based reasoning (CBR) [Kol93,AP94] allowing for the retrieval and adaptation of past examples (called cases) seems to be the appropriate reasoning method.

Reference-contexts: Solutions sharing many relations with past examples are preferred. Case-based reasoning (CBR) [Kol93,AP94] allowing for the retrieval and adaptation of past examples (called cases) seems to be the appropriate reasoning method. However, it does not support case retrieval based on structural similarity and case adaptation by case combination, see <ref> [BCPT96] </ref> for a detailed discussion. The approach of Conceptual Analogy (CA) was developed to overcome these limitations [Bor97]. CA is a general approach that relies on conceptual clustering to facilitate the efficient use of past cases in analogous situations.

Reference-contexts: We begin in Section 2 by introducing our approach which centers around enabling the system to learn unobtrusively from the user and to successively adapt according to user preferences. Section 3 sketches the approach of Conceptual Analogy that was described in detail elsewhere <ref> [Bor97] </ref> and is applied to achieve generative, adaptive HCI based on concepts. In section 4 we summarize our work this far and provide an outlook. 2 Adaptive human-computer interaction Any computer system like any person makes certain (inter)actions easier to achieve and is more or less intuitive to understand. <p> However, it does not support case retrieval based on structural similarity and case adaptation by case combination, see [BCPT96] for a detailed discussion. The approach of Conceptual Analogy (CA) was developed to overcome these limitations <ref> [Bor97] </ref>. CA is a general approach that relies on conceptual clustering to facilitate the efficient use of past cases in analogous situations. The approach divides the overall design task into memory organization and analogical reasoning both processing graph-based case representations.

Reference-contexts: Generative interaction (e.g., during navigation and manipulation) refers to the generation of useful knowledge structures (e.g., a plan or a design) to satisfy a user's goals. Adaptive interaction entails the personalization of content and presentation of it <ref> [Lan97] </ref>. Content involves the knowledge structures and inferences used to support human problem solving. The presentation of content refers to the implemented human-computer interface inclusive its interaction possibilities. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques can be applied advantageously to personalize contents.

In a third run the sys-tem may combine the first and second path to support navigation.
