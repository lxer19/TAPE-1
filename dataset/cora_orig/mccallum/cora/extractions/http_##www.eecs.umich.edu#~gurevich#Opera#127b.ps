Abstract: Related Results Abstract. We show that simultaneous rigid E-unification, or SREU for short, is decidable and in fact EXPTIME-complete in the case of one variable. This result implies that the 8 fl 98 fl fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is decidable. Together with a previous result regarding the undecidability of the 99-fragment, we obtain a complete classification of decidability of the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality, in terms of the quantifier prefix. It is also proved that SREU with one variable and a constant bound on the number of rigid equations is P-complete. Moreover, we consider a case of SREU where one allows several variables, but each rigid equation either contains one variable, or has a ground left-hand side and an equality between two variables as a right hand side. We show that SREU is decidable also in this restricted case.

Reference-contexts: We show that SREU is decidable also in this restricted case. The proof is by reduction to the decidable first-order theory of ground rewrite systems, or GRS <ref> [10] </ref>. In Section 7 we summarize the current status of SREU and list some open problems. 2 Preliminaries We will first establish some notation and terminology. We follow Chang and Keisler [4] regarding first-order languages and structures. <p> SREU restricted to systems with the united one variable property is called united one variable SREU. The main result of this section is that the united one variable SREU is decidable. The proof is by reduction to the decidable first-order theory of ground rewrite systems <ref> [10] </ref>. 5.1 The Decidable Theory GRS Now we formally define the theory of ground rewrite systems or GRS. Consider a signature that contains all the function symbols and constants that we are going to need in the sequel. Let be the following signature constructed from . <p> Note that the only ground terms in the signature of A are the constants t for t 2 T , since there are no function symbols in of positive arity. 3 In the original definition of GRS <ref> [10] </ref> there are two more relation symbols for each E, but we do not use them here.

For each constant t 2 , t A = t. 2. <p> For each relation symbol R E 2 , R A E is the rewrite relation fl We can now define GRS as the first-order theory of A, i.e., GRS = f ' a sentence in j A j= ' g: We use the following result <ref> [10] </ref>. Theorem 12 (Dauchet-Tison). GRS is decidable. The proof of Theorem 12 is by reduction to finite tree automata.

Reference-contexts: We write Terms (E) for the set of all terms that occur in E, in particular Terms (E) is closed under the subterm relation. We will use the following lemma. Lemma 1 follows also from a more general statement in de Kogel <ref> [11, Theorem 5.11] </ref>. Lemma 1. Let t be a ground term, c a constant, E a finite set of ground equations and e a ground equation. Let T = Terms (E [ feg). <p> This establishes the inclusion of SREU with one variable in EXPTIME. We then show that DTAI reduces to SREU with one variable, which shows the hardness part. The construction that we will use is in fact based on a construction in de Kogel <ref> [11, Theorems 4.1 and 4.2] </ref> that is based on Shostak's congruence closure algorithm [45]. 1 A similar construction is used also in Gurevich and Voronkov [30]. 4.1 SREU with one variable is in EXPTIME In the following we will assume that none of the rigid equations are redundant. <p> Clearly, it is enough to prove that, for all t; s 2 T , E j= t s , A j= t s: For a proof of this statement see de Kogel <ref> [11] </ref>. The second part is proved as follows. The number of terms in Terms (E) is proportional to the size of E. It follows by Theorem 2 that the time complexity of the construction of Q, i.e., the time complexity to partition Terms (E) into congruence classes, is polynomial. <p> The first decidability proof of rigid E-unification is given in Gallier, Narendran, Plaisted and Sny-der [24]. Recently a simpler proof, without computational complexity considerations, has been given by de Kogel <ref> [11] </ref>. We start with the solved cases: Rigid E-unification with ground left-hand side is NP-complete [34]. Rigid E-unification in general is NP-complete and there exist finite complete sets of unifiers [24,23]. 16 Degtyarev et al. Rigid E-unification with one variable is P-complete.

Reference-contexts: If the left-hand sides are ground then the monadic case is decidable [30]. Monadic SREU with one variable is PSPACE-complete [30].

Monadic SREU is equivalent to a non-trivial extension of word equations [30]. Monadic SREU is equivalent to the provability problem of the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality with function symbols of arity 1 [16]. In general SREU is undecidable [15].

Reference-contexts: If all function symbols have arity 1 (the monadic case) then it follows that SREU is PSPACE-hard [27]. If only one unary function symbol is allowed then the problem is decidable [14,13]. If only constants are allowed then the problem is NP-complete <ref> [14] </ref> if there are at least two constants. About the monadic case it is known that SREU with more than two unary function symbols is decidable if and only if it is decidable with just two unary function symbols [14]. <p> If only constants are allowed then the problem is NP-complete <ref> [14] </ref> if there are at least two constants.

Reference-contexts: It was shown recently in Degtyarev and Voronkov <ref> [15] </ref> that SREU is undecidable. The strong connections between SREU and intuitionistic logic with equality have led to new important decidability results in the latter area [16,54]. It follows, for example, that the 9 fl -fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is undecidable [17,18]. <p> Monadic SREU is equivalent to a non-trivial extension of word equations [30].

Furthermore, SREU is undecidable with three rigid equa tions with ground left-hand sides and two variables [51,29]. - SREU with one variable is decidable, in fact EXPTIME-complete (Theo rem 10).

Reference-contexts: SREU with one variable is decidable, in fact EXPTIME-complete. This result is obtained by a polynomial time reduction of SREU with one variable to the intersection nonemptiness problem of finite tree automata. The latter problem is EXPTIME-complete [50]. By using an analogue of a Skolemization result for intuitionistic logic <ref> [16] </ref> we can deduce the following result. The 8 fl 98 fl -fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is decidable. The above results imply the following main contribution of this paper. <p> We can note that, in general, the decidability of monadic SREU is still an open problem. There is also a very close connection between monadic SREU and the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality restricted to function symbols of arity 1 <ref> [16] </ref>. 5 United One Variable Case In this section we extend the decidability result of SREU with one variable to SREU with multiple variables with the following syntactical restriction on the structure of each rigid equation. <p> Some of these results are: 1. Decidability, and in particular PSPACE-completeness, of the prenex frag ment of intuitionistic logic without equality [53]. 2. Prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality but without function symbols is PSPACE-complete <ref> [16] </ref>. Decidability of this fragment was proved in Orevkov [42]. SREU with One Variable 15 3. Prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality in the language with one unary function symbol is decidable [16]. 4. 9 fl -fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is undecidable [17,18]. <p> Prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality but without function symbols is PSPACE-complete <ref> [16] </ref>. Decidability of this fragment was proved in Orevkov [42]. SREU with One Variable 15 3. Prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality in the language with one unary function symbol is decidable [16]. 4. 9 fl -fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is undecidable [17,18]. In some of the above results, the corresponding result has first been obtained for a fragment of SREU with similar restrictions. For example, the proof of the last statement is based on the undecidability of SREU. <p> Theorem 16. The 8 fl 98 fl -fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is decidable and EXPTIME-hard. Proof. Intuitionistic provability of any formula in the 8 fl 98 fl -fragment can be reduced to solvability of SREU with one variable <ref> [16] </ref>. Conversely, solvability of a system of rigid equations with one variable reduces trivially to provability of a corresponding formula in the 9-fragment [16]. The statement follows by Theorem 10. ut Remark The undecidability of the 99-fragment holds if there is one binary function symbol in the signature. <p> Proof. Intuitionistic provability of any formula in the 8 fl 98 fl -fragment can be reduced to solvability of SREU with one variable <ref> [16] </ref>.

There is a logspace reduction from second-order unification to SREU <ref> [18] </ref>. In fact, SREU is logspace equivalent to second-order unification [52]. Note also that SREU is decidable when there are no variables, since each rigid equation can be decided for example by using any congruence closure algorithm or ground term rewriting technique.

Reference-contexts: The problem of solvability of systems of rigid equations is called simultaneous rigid E-unification or SREU for short. Solvability of a single rigid equation is called rigid E-unification. Rigid E-unification is known to be decidable, in fact NP-complete <ref> [24] </ref>. 2.4 Term Rewriting In some cases it is convenient to consider a system of ground equations as a rewrite system. We will assume that the reader is familiar with basic notions regarding ground term rewrite systems [19]. We will only use very elementary properties. <p> Stat-man proves that the intuitionistic propositional logic is PSPACE-complete [47]. 7 Current Status of SREU and Open Problems Here we briefly summarize the current status of SREU. The first decidability proof of rigid E-unification is given in Gallier, Narendran, Plaisted and Sny-der <ref> [24] </ref>. Recently a simpler proof, without computational complexity considerations, has been given by de Kogel [11]. We start with the solved cases: Rigid E-unification with ground left-hand side is NP-complete [34].

If only constants are allowed then the problem is NP-complete [14] if there are at least two constants.

Reference-contexts: One conclusion we can draw from this is that the intractability of SREU with one variable is strongly related to the number of rigid equations and not their size. With two variables, SREU is undecidable already with three rigid equations <ref> [29] </ref>. Moreover, we consider a case of SREU where one allows several variables, but each rigid equation either contains one variable, or has a ground left-hand side and an equality between two variables as a right-hand side. We show that SREU is decidable also in this restricted case.

Reference-contexts: We will use the following definition. I The nonemptiness problem of TAs is the following decision problem. Given a TA A, is T (A) nonempty? The nonemptiness problem of DTAs is basically the problem of generability of finitely presented algebras. The latter problem is P-complete <ref> [32] </ref> and thus, by a very simple reduction, also the DTA nonemptiness problem is P-complete [50]. 2 For bounded SREU with one variable we get the following result.

Reference-contexts: We prove the following. SREU with one variable is decidable, in fact EXPTIME-complete. This result is obtained by a polynomial time reduction of SREU with one variable to the intersection nonemptiness problem of finite tree automata. The latter problem is EXPTIME-complete <ref> [50] </ref>. By using an analogue of a Skolemization result for intuitionistic logic [16] we can deduce the following result. The 8 fl 98 fl -fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is decidable. The above results imply the following main contribution of this paper. <p> Given a collection f A i j 1 i n g of DTAs, is T n nonempty? The EXPTIME-completeness of the intersection nonemptiness problem of finite tree automata has been observed by other authors [22,27,44] and strictly proved for DTAs in Veanes <ref> [50] </ref>. Theorem 5 (Veanes). DTAI is EXPTIME-complete. We will first show that SREU with one variable reduces to DTAI in polynomial time. This establishes the inclusion of SREU with one variable in EXPTIME. We then show that DTAI reduces to SREU with one variable, which shows the hardness part. <p> Given a TA A, is T (A) nonempty? The nonemptiness problem of DTAs is basically the problem of generability of finitely presented algebras. The latter problem is P-complete [32] and thus, by a very simple reduction, also the DTA nonemptiness problem is P-complete <ref> [50] </ref>. 2 For bounded SREU with one variable we get the following result. Theorem 11. Bounded SREU with one variable is P-complete. Proof. Let the number of rigid equations be bounded by some fixed positive integer n. P-hardness follows from Theorem 2.

Reference-contexts: The strong connections between SREU and intuitionistic logic with equality have led to new important decidability results in the latter area [16,54]. It follows, for example, that the 9 fl -fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is undecidable [17,18]. This result is improved in Veanes <ref> [51] </ref> to the following. The 99-fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is undecidable. The decidability of the 9-fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality, or equivalently SREU with one variable, has been an open problem which is settled in this paper. We prove the following. <p> In some of the above results, the corresponding result has first been obtained for a fragment of SREU with similar restrictions. For example, the proof of the last statement is based on the undecidability of SREU. The undecidability of the 9 fl -fragment is improved in Veanes <ref> [51] </ref> where it is proved that, already the 5. 99-fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is undecidable. With the following result we obtain a complete characterization of decidability of the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality with respect to quantifier prefix. Theorem 16.

Some of these results are: 1. Decidability, and in particular PSPACE-completeness, of the prenex frag ment of intuitionistic logic without equality [53]. 2. Prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality but without function symbols is PSPACE-complete [16]. Decidability of this fragment was proved in Orevkov [42]. <p> Many new decidability results about the prenex fragment have been obtained quite recently by Degtyarev and Voronkov [16-18] and Voronkov <ref> [53] </ref>.
