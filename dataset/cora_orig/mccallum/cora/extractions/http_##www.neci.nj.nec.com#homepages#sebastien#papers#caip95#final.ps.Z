Abstract: A direct method for estimating the rotational motion between two image frames is developed. The algorithm does not require knowledge of image correspondences, optical flow or scene structure and only assumes approximate knowledge of the translational motion. Spatial and temporal intensity gradients are avoided, resulting in an algorithm that is noise resistant. Moreover, the algorithm does not assume a particular projection model and is valid for both orthographic and perspective models. It is based on a statistical measure of epipolar misalignment. Specifically, that (1) the intensity histograms of corresponding epipolar lines are invariant (ignoring occlusions) and, more importantly, that (2) the histograms of "almost corresponding" epipolar lines are similar. This latter property is a function of the spatial correlation present in the image and it is empirically demonstrated to be well behaved over a large class of scenes. These epipolar properties of histograms, i.e. that the difference between two histograms is a minimum when the two epipolar lines truly correspond and (approximately) increases monotonically with the degree of misalignment between two "epipolar" lines, allows the rotational motion to be estimated in a straightforward manner as a 3-dimensional "epipolar search". Experimental results are presented on the SRI JISCT stereo database to empirically support the epipolar properties of intensity histograms. The calibrated NASA helicopter flight sequence is then analyzed to quantify the accuracy with which the rotations can be estimated. Experimental results indicate that very precise rotational estimates can be achieved.

Reference-contexts: Property 2 is valid for a large class of spatial imagery, despite the fact that it is straightforward to construct artificial images for which Property 2 does not hold. In <ref> [1] </ref> Property 2 is proved for the case in which intensity values are spatially Normally distributed, a condition that is true for many natural scenes. Intuitively, Property 2 is a consequence of the high degree of spatial correlation [9] present in most images.

Reference-contexts: However, the sensitivity to the CIB constraint is no more so than other direct and indirect methods. Moreover, when the CIB assumption was not valid, this could be corrected for many times, via a simple prepocessing step <ref> [2] </ref> to significantly extend the applicability of the algorithm. As with other techniques, the algorithm is sensitive to images with a very small field of view since, under this condition, it becomes very difficult to differentiate between small rotations and translations.
