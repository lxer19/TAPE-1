Title: On the Practicality of Abductive Validation  
Author: Tim Menzies 
Keyword: Abduction, validation, computational complexity, expert systems, knowledge acquisition.  
Abstract: An abductive framework is described for validating theories using a library of known or desired behaviour. Abduction is known to be NP-hard which suggests that this framework is impractical for anything other than small theories. The computational limits of the framework is therefore explored. We find that abductive validation is a practical tool for the KBS we see in contemporary practice.

Reference-contexts: One drawback with abduction is that it is slow.

Computa-tionally tractable abductive inference algorithms (e.g. [1, 4]) typically make restrictive assumptions about the nature of the theory or the available data.

Therefore, it is reasonable to question the practicality of HT4 for medium to large theories. <p> Selman & Levesque show that even when only one abductive explanation is required and the theory is restricted to be acyclic, then abduction is NP-hard [9].

Reference-contexts: Note that some of the assumptions will contradict other assumptions and will be controversial (denoted A C ). For example, assuming cDown and cUp at the same time is contradictory. DeKleer's key insight <ref> [3] </ref> was that, in terms of uniquely defining an assumption space, the key controversial assumptions are those controversial assumptions that are not dependent on other controversial assumptions. We denote these base controversial assump tions A B .

Like the Smythe '87 study, these errors had not been detected previously by international peer review. When HT4 ran over the full 870 comparisons, it found more errors than QMOD. Only 150 of the comparisons could explain 100% of their OU T puts.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION The connection between abduction and other KBS inference tasks (e.g. model-based diagnosis) is well-documented <ref> [2, 7] </ref>. It would be convenient if we could execute and test our KBS in the same abductive framework. This would remove the need for complicated translations between the executable form of a KBS and its associated test engine. Here we explore KBS validation using HT4, an abductive inference engine. <p> A proof P j belongs in world W i if its forbids set does not intersect the assumptions EN V i that define that world. For more details on the internals of HT4, see <ref> [7] </ref>. HT4's runtimes are clearly exponential on theory size. In a theory comprising a directed and-or graph connecting literals V with E edges and average fan-in F = jE j , the worst-case complexity of the forwards sweep is acceptable at O (jVj 3 ). <p> In the changing N mutation study, the fanout was kept constant and the number of vertices were increased. Figure 6 shows the average runtime for executing HT4 over 94 and-or graphs and 1991 &lt; IN ; OU T &gt; pairs <ref> [7] </ref>. For that study, a give up time of 840 seconds was built into HT4. HT4 did not terminate for jVj 850 in under that give up time (shown in Figure 6 as a vertical line). <p> Six models were used of sizes jVj = f449; 480; 487; 494; 511; 535g. Figure 8 shows the results. At low fanouts, many behaviours were inexplicable. However, after a fanout of 4.4, most behaviours were explicable. Further, after a fanout of 6.8, nearly all the behaviours were explicable <ref> [7] </ref>. 25 60 80 100 % OU T covered Average fanout (jE j=jVj ) 449 3 3 480 fi fi fi 487 ? ? ? 494 4 4 4 4 511 + + + + 535 2 2 2 As a result of the mutation study we conclude that HT4 is

Reference-contexts: The only reliable data we could find is shown in Figure 7 which shows the size of the dependency graph between literals in fielded propositional expert systems <ref> [8] </ref>. Figure 7 suggests that a practical inference engine must work at least for the range 55 jVj 510 and 2 jVj Note that the Figure 6 results were obtained from a less-than-optimum platform: Smalltalk running on a Macintosh. <p> Verification tools search for syntactic anomalies within a knowledge base such as tautologies, redundancies, and circularities in the dependency graph of literals in a knowledge base <ref> [8] </ref>. Verification is not a definitive test for a KBS. Preece reports example where working expert systems contained syntactic anomalies, yet still performed adequately [8]. Validation tools assess a knowledge via some external semantic criteria; e.g. testing that a knowledge base model of X can reproduce known behaviour of X. <p> Verification tools search for syntactic anomalies within a knowledge base such as tautologies, redundancies, and circularities in the dependency graph of literals in a knowledge base <ref> [8] </ref>.
