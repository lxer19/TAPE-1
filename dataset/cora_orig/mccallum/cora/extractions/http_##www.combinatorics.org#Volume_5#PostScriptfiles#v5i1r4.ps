Abstract: It is proven that for k 4 and n &gt; k every k-color-critical graph on n vertices has at least 2 + k3 n edges, thus improving a result of Gallai from 1963. A graph G is k-color-critical (or simply k-critical) if (G) = k but (G 0 ) &lt; k for every proper subgraph G 0 of G, where (G) denotes the chromatic number of G. (See, e.g., [2] for a detailed account of graph coloring problems). Consider the following problem: given k and n, what is the minimal number of edges in a k-critical graph on n vertices? It is easy to see that every vertex of a k-critical graph G has degree at least k 1, implying jE(G)j k1 jV (G)j for every k-critical graph G (where k 4), which is not a clique K k on k vertices. In this note we strengthen Gallai's result by showing Theorem 1 Suppose k 4, and let G = (V; E) be a k-critical graph on more than k vertices. Then jE(G)j k 1 + 2(k 2 2k 1) jV (G)j :
