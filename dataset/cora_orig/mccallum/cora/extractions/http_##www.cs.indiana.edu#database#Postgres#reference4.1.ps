Note: This document is the reference manual for the POSTGRES database management system under development at the University of California at Berkeley. The POSTGRES project, led by Professor Michael Stone-braker, is sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Army Research Office (ARO), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and ESL, Inc. POSTGRES is distributed in source code format and is the property of the Regents of the University of Cal-ifornia. However, the University will grant unlimited commercialization rights for any d erived work on  Note that there is no organization who can help you with any bugs you may encounter or with any other prob lems. In other words, this is unsupported software.  This reference describes Version 4.1 of POSTGRES. The POSTGRES software is about 200,000 lines of C  Version 4.1 has been  Digital Equipment Corporation computers based on MIPS R2000 and R3000 processors (under Ultrix 4.2 and 4.3) and Sun Microsystems computers based on SPARC processors (under SunOS 4.1). Work is underway to support Digital Equipment Corporation computers based on Alpha AXP (DECchip 21064) processors (under OSF/1) and Hewlett-Packard computers based on PA RISC processors (under HP-UX).  This reference manual describes the functionality of Version 4.1 and contains notations where appropriate to indicate which features are not implemented in Version 4.1. Application developers should note that this reference contains only the  01/23/93 1  
Abstract: The remainder of this reference manual is structured as follows. In Section 2 (UNIX), we discuss the POSTGRES capabilities that are available directly from the operating system. Section 3 (BUILT-INS) describes POSTGRES internal data types, functions, and operators. Section 4 (COMMANDS) then describes POSTQUEL, the language by which a user interacts with a POSTGRES database. Then, Section 5 (LIBPQ) describes a library of low lev el routines through which a user can formulate POSTQUEL queries from a C program and get appropriate return information back to his program. Next, Section 6 (FAST PATH) continues with a description of a method by which applications may execute functions in POST-GRES with very high performance. Section 7 (LARGE OBJECTS) describes the internal POSTGRES interface for accessing large objects. The reference concludes with Section 8 (FILES), a collection of file
