Abstract: Managing resources in the framework of the civil construction sector is usually an extremely complex task. The great number as well a s the variety of existing resources, both human and material, the diversity of tasks each working unity is able to execute, the degree of quality of its performance, the involved costs, the spatial distribution of all resources over the different places where they have been used leading to the need of transportation from one place to another, all are important factors that point out to a high number of variables leading to a somewhat difficult optimisation. On the other hand, these factors are highly dynamic as a result of unpredictable situations responsible for the modification of the initial conditions (like weather conditions, uncertainties attached to task duration, acquisition of new resources, technical problems related with those resources, accidents, etc). Such dynamics makes it mandatory for the systems to have the capability to continuously adapt themselves to the evolving real conditions, overcoming usual limitations of classical solutions. The aim of the MACIV project is the design and implementation of a computer system, mainly based on Distributed Artificial Intelligence techniques, enabling a decentralised management of different resources in Civil Construction Companies. This problem was inspired by a real large company whose experts have been involved with us on the problem definition and system design. In this paper, the overall system architecture is presented and the employed techniques are also explained, with special emphasis on the specific negotiation and coalition formation protocols. In order to support the particularities of the application, original inter and intra coalition negotiation algorithms and strategies were improved and are here explained. Finally, an application example is developed in order to illustrate the achieved solution for a concrete problem.

Reference-contexts: IV - Task Assignment The task assignment policy will be based on an announcement, bid and negotiation process inspired on the contract net algorithm proposed by Randall Davis <ref> [Dav83] </ref>. Several extensions to the contract net have been already presented [Mal88; Kuh93; San95a,b] but none of them including inter and intra-coalitions negotiation. The modifications now introduced to the contract net tend to represent the market oriented behaviour intended for the agents in our system [Oli96].

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the working cost of any agent should not be based only on factors like operation cost, maintenance and depreciation but it should also reflect other factors like competitiveness, in a market oriented style <ref> [Wel94] </ref>. In MACIV system, all the agents are exclusively trying to maximise their own benefits. They dont have any global information and they dont care about the global profits.
