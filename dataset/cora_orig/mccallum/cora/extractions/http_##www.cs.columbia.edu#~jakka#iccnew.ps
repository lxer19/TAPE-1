Abstract: The Leaky Bucket policing mechanism has been extensively studied in both the academic as well as the industrial communities, resulting in numerous publications. Recently, there has been much interest in solving the issues of admission control in High Speed Networks using parameters determined by the leaky bucket as the access control mechanism. In this paper, we demonstrate that the leaky bucket performs exceedingly poorly for a very important class of traffic, namely correlated traffic with real time constraints. An example of such traffic is Variable Bit Rate (VBR) video. For VBR video traffic we show that the leaky bucket policing mechanism acts as nothing more than a peak rate controller. We also show that malicious users could take advantage of this weakness, and hence gravely impact the Quality of Service (QOS) of honest users sharing the network resources. We use actual video sequences to demonstrate our results. Furthermore, we show that the cell loss rate for such traffic is insensitive to the token buffer and data buffer sizes. All of our results use finite buffers.

Reference-contexts: Unlike traditional networks, these networks will support applications which require a wide variety of services. Several types of real-time applications such as video, voice, image and data will share network bandwidth, buffers, switching and processing resources. As these networks increase in size and complexity, traffic such as video <ref> [2, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20] </ref> is expected to make up a large fraction of the total traffic. VBR video sources have strict real time constraints, and transmit packets (or cells) in a highly correlated fashion [20]. One of the fundamental network control issues is the source policing mechanism.
