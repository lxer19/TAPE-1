Title: The Semantics of Complex Types  
Author: James Pustejovsky

Abstract: In this paper, I examine the behavior of several classes of lexical items exhibiting various degrees of systematic or logical polysemy. These words present an interesting challenge to conventional treatments of polysemy in natural language semantics. Extending the analysis of these classes presented in Pustejovsky (1994,1995), I elaborate the formal mechanisms responisible for capturing the syntactic and semantic behavior of nouns such as lecture, prize, book, and lunch, and verbs such as read, rent, and break. I argue that members of these classes must be represented as complex types, as they do not allow for simple conjunctive typing; furthermore, these nouns and verbs display a peculiar behavior regarding the quantifi-cational force of the type which is absent from other nominal and verbal classes.

Reference-contexts: Consider briefly the behavior of rent. This verb is interesting because it allows for two subcategorizations, each corresponding to a distinct interpretation of the verb. Observe in (44) how the directionality of the relation is affected or dictated by the prepositional phrase selected for <ref> (cf. Bierwisch, 1983, Jackendoff, 1983) </ref>. (44) a. Mary rented the room from John. b. Mary rented the room to John. The interpretation given in one sentence entails the interpretation provided for in the other.

Reference-contexts: 1 Simple and Complex Meanings Over the past several years, there has been a resurgence of interest in questions relating to the "messiness" of word meaning. Inspired by a few early researchers who admitted of the complexity of sense determination and the fixing of reference <ref> (cf. Nunberg, 1979, Fauconnier, 1985, and Kayser, 1988) </ref>, much of the work in semantics and computational linguistics is now expressly concerned with the representation and processing of polysemous lexical items and phrases. I believe the reasons for this resurgence are two-fold.

Reference-contexts: These two facets together with two other roles, constitutive and agentive, make up what I have referred to as the qualia structure for a lexical item <ref> (cf.

One would not want to allow the free structuring or combinatorics of conjunctive properties, however, since this would generate more nonsense than well-formed concepts. <p> What is important to note, however, is that the dot object construction (i.e., the type product) allows otherwise contradictory types to be combined into a single type. From a conceptual development point of view, this suggests that complex types are in fact learned later than simple or unified types <ref> (cf. Pustejovsky, 1995, for some discussion) </ref>. In order to make this clearer, I will distinguish two classes of complex type nominals, endocentric and exocentric dot objects.

Reference-contexts: For example, in sentence (44a), the to NP phrase acts as a selector function over the relation, returning that relational element from the complex which satisfies its type <ref> (cf. Pustejovsky, 1996 for more details) </ref>. To conclude this section, let us briefly discuss why exocentric dot object nominals such as meal behave differently, with respect to quantification, from 14 endocentric nouns such as book.
