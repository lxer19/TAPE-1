Abstract: A Boolean function in n variables is presented that is computable in depth 2 monotone AC 0 and has prime implicants of length 2 only but requires 2 ( p n) size read-once branching programs. The function considered is defined using (1,1)- disjoint Boolean sums and the solution of the famous problem of Zarankiewicz.

Reference-contexts: This could be proved for AC 0 -functions in [6, 10]. In [3] functions from AC 0;2 (polynomial-size DNF or CNF) are considered but lower bounds only are proved for the restricted model of ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs). Gal <ref> [4] </ref> presents a function from 0;2 (polynomial-size CNF) based on elementary properties of projective planes which requires read-once branching programs of size 2 ( p This function is remarkably simple and based on important combinatorial structures. <p> The prime implicants only have length 2, hence, the function belongs to the class of quadratic functions. The lower bound proof (see Section 3) differs from the typical lower bound proofs for read-once branching programs as described in the Lemma of <ref> [4] </ref>. It should be remarked that exponential lower bounds can be proved for more general than read-once branching programs. <p> Let n = p 2 for some odd prime number p. The construction is based on the fact that straight lines in ZZ p intersect in at most one point. This is somehow similar to the construction in <ref> [4] </ref>. Let a; b 2 ZZ p . The set A a;b (or A i for i = a + bp) contains all j = c + dp where c; d 2 ZZ p and c (a + bd) mod p. <p> Moreover it is based like Gal's function on a fundamental combinatorial structure. 3 THE LOWER BOUND The aim is to prove an exponential lower bound on the read-once branching program complexity of the function f fl defined in Section 2. The typical method for such proofs (see <ref> [4] </ref>) is to prove that each read-once branching program for the considered function f has to start with a complete binary tree of depth d. Then the lower bound is 2 d 1. <p> =2c &lt; dn 1=2 =2e and we have proved the existence of some y i which is a prime implicant of f fl p 0 but not of f fl Altogether we have proved the Theorem. 2 Our proof method may be useful also for other functions. 4 REMARKS Gal <ref> [4] </ref> discusses whether Boolean functions may need exponential read-once programs even if they and their negations can be computed by polynomial-size nondeterministic read-once programs. This problem has been solved affirmatively by Jukna, Razborov, Savicky, and Wegener [7]. There remains one open problem.

Reference-contexts: Many papers consider read-once branching programs. This is the most general model where each graph-theoretical path is the computation path for some input. Read-once branching programs also may be applied under some restrictions as data structure for boolean functions for verification and other purposes <ref> [5, 18] </ref>. Exponential lower bounds on the read-once branching program complexity of explicit functions are known since a long time. The first bounds [21, 22] are of size 2 ( p n) where n is the number of variables. The later development follows different directions.
