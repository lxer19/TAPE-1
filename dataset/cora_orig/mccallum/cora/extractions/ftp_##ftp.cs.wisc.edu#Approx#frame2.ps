Abstract: Shift-invariance "fiberization techniques" are applied for the study of the synthesis and analysis operators of affine (wavelet) systems. In this approach, one has first to circumvent the fact that affine systems are not shift-invariant. The results obtained include characterizations of the Bessel property, the Riesz basis property and the frame property of such sets in terms of the behaviour of simpler operators. Various estimates of the lower and upper frame (Riesz) bounds are included, too. Complete details will appear in [7]. would like to consider X as a "basis" for either the entire L 2 -space, or, in case X is not fundamental in L 2 , for the closed subspace H L 2 "spanned" by X. The goal is to use X for either decomposing functions in H or for reconstructing such functions. The reconstruction is done with the aid of the synthesis operator The underlying assumption here is that T X is bounded, i.e., that it is bounded on the finitely supported elements of ` 2 (X) and is extended to the entire domain by continuity. In that event, X is said to be a Bessel system. Otherwise, T X is only densely defined (say, on the finitely supported sequences). The adjoint of T fl
