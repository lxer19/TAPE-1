Abstract: To support emerging real-time applications, high speed integrated services networks need to provide end-to-end performance guarantees on a per-connection basis in a networking environment. In addition to the issue of how to allocate resources to meet diverse QOS requirements in a single switch, resource management algorithms also need to account for the fact that traffic may get burstier and burstier as it traverses the network due to complex interaction among packet streams at each switch. To address this problem, several non-work-conserving packet service disciplines have been proposed that fully or partially reconstruct the traffic pattern of the original source inside the network. This is achieved by a policing or delay-jitter control mechanism in which packets may be held at intermediate switches in order to keep the traffic from becoming burstier. In this paper, we compare two non-work-conserving disciplines: Stop-and-Go and Rate-Controlled Static Priority or RCSP. Stop-and-Go uses a multi-level framing strategy to allocate resources in a single switch and to ensure traffic smoothness throughout the network. RCSP decouples the server functions by having two components: a regulator to partially or

Reference-contexts: Both Stop-and-Go and RCSP needs a mechanism to service packets according to a non-preemptive static priority policy, which is easy to implement in high speed switches. In fact, even early implementations of commercial ATM switches have at least two priority levels <ref> [2] </ref>. Experimental ATM switches have more priority levels. In the Xunet switch, 16 priority levels are supported [12]. The difference between Stop-and-Go and RCSP is that RCSP requires the computation of the eligibility time to be performed on a per packet basis while Stop-and-Go needs only per frame processing.

Reference-contexts: Eligibility times for 17 packets from different connections are computed using the same formula with different parameters; holding packets is equivalent to managing a set of timers. One mechanism for managing timers is the calendar queue <ref> [3] </ref>. An implementation of RCSP which is based on the calendar queue and requires constant number of processing steps per packet is proposed in [27]. Another implementation based on a two-dimensional shifters is proposed in [18].

Reference-contexts: One solution to this problem is to characterize the traffic pattern distortion inside the network, and derive the traffic characterization at the entrance to each switch from characterizations of the source traffic and of the traffic pattern distortions <ref> [4, 1, 21, 16] </ref>. In general, characterizing traffic inside the network is difficult. In networks with work-conserving service disciplines, even in the situations when traffic inside the network can be characterized, the worst-case traffic is usually more bursty inside the network than that at the entrance. <p> In networks with work-conserving service disciplines, even in the situations when traffic inside the network can be characterized, the worst-case traffic is usually more bursty inside the network than that at the entrance. This property is independent of the traffic model being used. In <ref> [4] </ref>, a deterministic fluid model (; ) is used to characterize a traffic source. A source is said to satisfy (; ) if during any time interval of length u, the amount of its output traffic is less than + u. <p> However, the RCSP algorithm is general and other traffic characterization can be used. For example, the (; ) model proposed in <ref> [4] </ref> may be used. In this case, RCSP's regulators are simply leaky buckets. Additionally, if a more elaborate deterministic BIND model is used [15], the flexibility offered by RCSP allows the admission control algorithm to accept additional connections. <p> Since the frame size is also the local delay bound, the coupling between traffic specification and the delay allocation implies that admission control algorithm has to be based on a busy period argument, which tends out to produce looser bounds when compared to more elaborate analysis <ref> [4, 28] </ref>. This will be discussed in more detail in Section 4.3. Because of the framing, there are dependencies among the local delay bounds at each priority level in a Stop-and-Go server. <p> Different service disciplines have different corresponding admission 9 control conditions. In this section, we first review the admission control conditions Stop-and-Go and RCSP. We then compare the conditions by using deterministic fluid model analysis developed in <ref> [4] </ref>. 4.1 Stop-and-go In Stop-and-Go, the connection admission control algorithm needs to ensure that all packets from an incoming frame of an input link will always go out on the next departing frame of the output link. The following theorem gives the condition. <p> above by d m , where d m = maxfu : u 0; b 0 m (u) l fi ug m (ff) is defined for all ff by b 0 fi0 fSmax + X b m;j (fi) + q=1 j2C q The proof is by extension of the results of <ref> [4] </ref>. Details may also be found in [26]. The end-to-end delay of a packet consists of the link delays the packet experienced and the residence times of the packet in each of the switches along the path. <p> The difference between the two curves is the number of bits currently in the queue, or the backlog function. When the backlog function returns to zero (the two curves meet) there are no bits in the queue and thus a busy period has ended. Two key observations follow <ref> [4] </ref>: 1. the maximum busy period provides an upper bound on any work-conserving server; 2. the maximum backlog divided by link speed provides an upper bound on delay for a FCFS server. <p> Delay bounds for other policies can also be expressed as the function of the two curves <ref> [1, 4, 20] </ref>. The admission control criteria of Stop-and-Go relies on a bound on the busy period. That is, Stop-and-Go ensures that a busy period is bounded by a frame time so that during each frame time, all packets that arrived in the previous frame are guaranteed to be served.

Reference-contexts: Queueing analysis is often intractable for realistic traffic models. Also, classical queueing analyses usually study average performance for aggregate traffic [14], while in integrated-services networks performance bounds need to be derived on a per-connection basis <ref> [5, 17] </ref>. In addition to the challenge of providing end-to-end per-connection performance guarantees to heterogeneous, bursty traffic, service disciplines must be simple enough that they can be implemented at very high speeds. A service discipline can be classified as either work-conserving or non-work-conserving.

Reference-contexts: It has been argued that a connection-oriented architecture, with explicit resource allocation and connection admission control, is needed to offer such a real-time service <ref> [6] </ref>. In a packet-switching network, packets from different connections will interact with each other at each switch. Without proper control, these interactions may adversely affect the network performance experienced by clients. <p> In Section 7, we review some of the related work. Finally, in Section 8, we conclude the paper by summarizing major results of the paper. 2 Background In order to provide end-to-end performance guarantees on a per connection basis, a connection-oriented and reservation-based architecture is needed <ref> [6] </ref>. In such an architecture, there are two phases in a communication session: connection establishment and data transfer. During the connection establishment, the client first specifies its end-to-end traffic and performance parameters to the network. <p> A stream of packets is called (r; T )-smooth if during each frame of length T the total number of bits that are transmitted by the source is no more than r T bits. 3 In RCSP, the (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) model has been used <ref> [6] </ref>. In this model, Xmin is the minimum packet inter-arrival time, Xave is the average packet inter-arrival time over an averaging interval I, and Smax is the maximum packet size. However, the RCSP algorithm is general and other traffic characterization can be used. <p> Delay-EDD scheduler is used, and the (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) traffic model is adopted, the amount of buffer space required at the i th switch along the path traversed by the connection is P i Xmin Smax, where d k is the local delay bound at the k th switch <ref> [6, 31] </ref>. Stop-and-Go and RCSP require less buffer space not only inside the network, but also at the destination 13 node. <p> For RCSP, as noted in Section 4, a tighter source model can result in more accepted channels and thus higher network utilization. For this reason, for RCSP we investigate the maximum number of channels that can be accepted for both the 14 (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) model of <ref> [6] </ref> as well as the tighter BIND model of [15]. Alternatively, for Stop-and-Go, the admission control analysis can only make use of information on the maximum number of bits that a source will transmit in an interval of length T , where T is the frame time. <p> It differs from Stop-and-Go in that it does not use synchronized framing structure across links, thus it cannot provide tight end-to-end delay-jitter bounds. Among the work-conserving disciplines proposed are: Virtual Clock [32], variations of the Earliest-Due-Date algorithms <ref> [6, 13] </ref>, and Generalized Processor Sharing [20]. All of them use a sorted priority queue mechanism [31], which make it difficult to implement in high-speed switches.

Reference-contexts: With P and B frames, higher compression ratios can be achieved since the interframe coding makes use of motion compensation techniques. More details of the MPEG algorithm may be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. It is assumed that the entire frame is transmitted per frame time (as opposed to introducing additional delay by smoothing over several frames) so that Figure 6 is simply the frame size multipled by the frame rate (30 fps).

Reference-contexts: Additionally, if a more elaborate deterministic BIND model is used [15], the flexibility offered by RCSP allows the admission control algorithm to accept additional connections. This will be demonstrated in Section 5 using real traffic traces. 3.2 Stop-and-Go Stop-and-Go uses a framing strategy <ref> [8] </ref>. In such a strategy, the time axis is divided into frames, which are periods of some constant length T . Stop-and-Go defines departing and arriving frames for each link.

Reference-contexts: In particular, T m+1 = K m T m must hold, with 1 m &lt; n, and K m being an integer. In addition, the delay bound allocations for each connection in different switches are coupled with one another. In <ref> [9] </ref>, a connection has to have the same frame size in all the switches. In [31], a looser requirement is presented: the frame times of a connection along the path should be non-decreasing. None of these restrictions apply to RCSP. <p> If m X X r j T m + Smax lT m (5) all the packets coming in a T m frame will be serviced before the next T m expires. The theorem is proven in <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> The proof is given in <ref> [9] </ref>. 4.2 RCSP In RCSP, the admission control algorithm needs to ensure that local delay bounds can be guaranteed for each connection at the scheduler. In order to perform admission control tests, the traffic characteristics must be specified for each connection traversing the server.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we compare two representative non-work-conserving disciplines proposed in the context of high speed networks: Stop-and-Go and Rate-Controlled Static Priority. Although both Stop-and-Go and RCSP can be used to provide statistical guarantees <ref> [10, 30] </ref>, only deterministic performance guarantees are considered in this paper. The paper is organized as the follows. In Section 2, we discuss the background and motivate the need for non-work-conserving disciplines.

Reference-contexts: In [24], another rate-controlled discipline is proposed with a First-Come-First-Served scheduler. Though much simpler than EDD, a FCFS scheduler provides only one delay bound and thus cannot efficiently support the diverse QOS requirement in the future integrated services networks. Hierarchical Round Robin <ref> [11] </ref> is a service discipline that also uses a multi-level framing strategy. It differs from Stop-and-Go in that it does not use synchronized framing structure across links, thus it cannot provide tight end-to-end delay-jitter bounds.

Reference-contexts: However, the RCSP algorithm is general and other traffic characterization can be used. For example, the (; ) model proposed in [4] may be used. In this case, RCSP's regulators are simply leaky buckets. Additionally, if a more elaborate deterministic BIND model is used <ref> [15] </ref>, the flexibility offered by RCSP allows the admission control algorithm to accept additional connections. This will be demonstrated in Section 5 using real traffic traces. 3.2 Stop-and-Go Stop-and-Go uses a framing strategy [8]. <p> This regulator is currently advocated by the ATM Forum and implemented in several commercial switches. As the name suggests, this regulator is based on enforcing two (; ) pairs. More details on the use of leaky bucket policing for RCSP can be found in <ref> [15] </ref>. A second possible RCSP regulator that has additional advantages over the dual leaky bucket regulator is a delay-jitter regulator. <p> This proposition is more general than Proposition 1. It applies to any traffic specification, rather than just (r; T ) smoothness. In the original discussion of RCSP [27], the traffic model (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) is used. In <ref> [15] </ref>, a more elaborate deterministic Bounding Interval Dependent or BIND model is proposed. Which traffic model to use affects the admission control algorithm. <p> For this reason, for RCSP we investigate the maximum number of channels that can be accepted for both the 14 (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) model of [6] as well as the tighter BIND model of <ref> [15] </ref>. Alternatively, for Stop-and-Go, the admission control analysis can only make use of information on the maximum number of bits that a source will transmit in an interval of length T , where T is the frame time. <p> First, the general trend of the curves is that with an increasing delay, more channels can be accepted. Also, not shown is the fact that a peak-rate allocation scheme would result in 29 channels accepted. The ratio of the number of accepted channels to 29 what is termed in <ref> [15] </ref> as the deterministic multiplexing gain (DMG). That is, even though all packets are deterministically guaranteed to meet their loss and delay bounds, sources may 15 (a) (b) be multiplexed beyond their peak rate. For the RCSP/BIND curve, even for small delay bounds, DMG's significantly greater than 1 are achievable. <p> The reason for this is that the intense action and colors of the advertisement sequence results in a very bursty deterministic traffic specification (see <ref> [15] </ref> for further details). Thus, this source is more difficult to multiplex. The maximum achievable DMG for RCSP/BIND is 1.33.

Reference-contexts: However, results from these studies are not directly applicable in the context of integrated-services networks. Analyses of hard real-time systems usually assume a single server environment, periodic jobs, and the job delay bounded by its period <ref> [23] </ref>. However, network traffic is bursty, and the delay constraint for each individual connection is independent of its bandwidth requirement. In addition, bounds on end-to-end performance need to be guaranteed in a networking environment, where traffic dynamics are far more complex than in a single server environment.

Reference-contexts: It has many of the desirable properties possessed by Stop-and-Go and RCSP. For example, Jitter-EDD provides per-connection end-to-end delay and delay-jitter bounds and allows the buffer space requirements to be uniformly distributed across the network. However, it is unclear how to implement an EDD scheduler efficiently. In <ref> [24] </ref>, another rate-controlled discipline is proposed with a First-Come-First-Served scheduler. Though much simpler than EDD, a FCFS scheduler provides only one delay bound and thus cannot efficiently support the diverse QOS requirement in the future integrated services networks.

The end-to-end delay of a packet consists of the link delays the packet experienced and the residence times of the packet in each of the switches along the path. <p> Also, in a network with work 18 conserving disciplines, more resources such as buffer space are needed in downstream switches due to traffic pattern distortions inside the network. As well, more buffer space is needed at the destination to provide an isochronous service <ref> [22, 26] </ref>. 8 Conclusion This paper compares two packet service disciplines proposed to support guaranteed performance service in a connection-oriented packet switched network: Rate-Controlled Static Priority (RCSP) and Stop-and-Go.

Reference-contexts: However, the coupling between delay and service quantum still exists within each frame. 5 3.3 Rate-Controlled Static-Priority A Rate-Controlled Static-Priority server differs from a Stop-and-Go server in that it uses two components to allocate delay bounds and bandwidth instead of one framing structure <ref> [27] </ref>. These two components are a rate controller and a static-priority scheduler. The rate controller shapes the input traffic from each connection into the desired traffic pattern by assigning an eligibility time to each packet. The scheduler then orders the transmission of eligible packets from all the connections. <p> This proposition is more general than Proposition 1. It applies to any traffic specification, rather than just (r; T ) smoothness. In the original discussion of RCSP <ref> [27] </ref>, the traffic model (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) is used. In [15], a more elaborate deterministic Bounding Interval Dependent or BIND model is proposed. Which traffic model to use affects the admission control algorithm. <p> In order to perform admission control tests, the traffic characteristics must be specified for each connection traversing the server. As mentioned in Section 3.3, many traffic models can 10 be used. In <ref> [27, 28] </ref>, admission control conditions were given for the (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) model. <p> One mechanism for managing timers is the calendar queue [3]. An implementation of RCSP which is based on the calendar queue and requires constant number of processing steps per packet is proposed in <ref> [27] </ref>. Another implementation based on a two-dimensional shifters is proposed in [18]. Both Stop-and-Go and RCSP needs a mechanism to service packets according to a non-preemptive static priority policy, which is easy to implement in high speed switches.

Reference-contexts: Since the frame size is also the local delay bound, the coupling between traffic specification and the delay allocation implies that admission control algorithm has to be based on a busy period argument, which tends out to produce looser bounds when compared to more elaborate analysis <ref> [4, 28] </ref>. This will be discussed in more detail in Section 4.3. Because of the framing, there are dependencies among the local delay bounds at each priority level in a Stop-and-Go server. <p> In order to perform admission control tests, the traffic characteristics must be specified for each connection traversing the server. As mentioned in Section 3.3, many traffic models can 10 be used. In <ref> [27, 28] </ref>, admission control conditions were given for the (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) model. <p> That is, for the SG calculations, we allow the admission control algorithm to choose the optimal value of I (Xave and r should be viewed as functions of I). Thus, the RCSP/Xmin curve uses the bound in <ref> [28] </ref>. Once again, as the delay bound increases, so does the number of channels accepted until the point of scheduler saturation. The maximum DMG for this traffic specification and scheduler is 2.41 achieved at a queueing delay bound of 58 msec.

Reference-contexts: With a non-work-conserving discipline, the server may be idle even when there are packets waiting to be sent. Recent study suggests that non-work-conserving disciplines have some unique characteristics that make them suitable to provide performance guarantees in packet switching networks <ref> [31, 29] </ref>. In this paper, we compare two representative non-work-conserving disciplines proposed in the context of high speed networks: Stop-and-Go and Rate-Controlled Static Priority. Although both Stop-and-Go and RCSP can be used to provide statistical guarantees [10, 30], only deterministic performance guarantees are considered in this paper. <p> requiring more resources at downstream switches and characterizing trafic inside the network are eliminated. 3 Service Disciplines In this section, we first review the traffic model used in Stop-and-Go and RCSP, we then describe each algorithm, and compare them by casting them into the same framework of rate-controlled service disciplines <ref> [29] </ref>. 3.1 Traffic Model In order to allocate resources for each connection, sources must specify their traffic characteristic. Addi tionally, if schedulers do traffic reconstruction, the reconstruction may often be described in terms of the original traffic description. In the literature, different traffic models have been used for different schedulers. <p> By maintaining traffic smoothness throughout the network, end-to-end delay bounds can be guaranteed in a network of arbitrary topology as long as each local server can ensure local delay bounds for (r; T ) smooth traffic. As discussed in <ref> [29] </ref>, one of the biggest advantages of non-work-conserving disciplines like Stop-and-Go is that they greatly simply the analysis in a networking environment by allowing a single node analysis to be extended a network of arbitrary topology. <p> Alternatively, RCSP decouples the two functions by using two components, a rate-controller and a scheduler. In this section, we discuss the implications and tradeoffs of this important difference. As shown in <ref> [29] </ref>, both Stop-and-Go and RCSP belong to a class of non-work-conserving disciplines called rate-controlled service disciplines. A rate-controlled server has two components: a rate-controller and a scheduler. Various rate-controllers and schedulers can be used. Different combinations of rate-controllers and schedulers will result in different rate-controlled disciplines. <p> The residence time of a packet in a switch with rate-controlled servers has two components: the holding time in the regulator and the waiting time in the scheduler. Theorem 3 only bounds the waiting time in the scheduler. The next theorem, proven in <ref> [29] </ref>, states that the end-to-end delays of all the packets on a connection can be bounded, as long as the delays on the links and the delays at each of the schedulers can be bounded. Holding in the rate controllers will not increase the end-to-end delay bound of the connection.

Reference-contexts: With a non-work-conserving discipline, the server may be idle even when there are packets waiting to be sent. Recent study suggests that non-work-conserving disciplines have some unique characteristics that make them suitable to provide performance guarantees in packet switching networks <ref> [31, 29] </ref>. In this paper, we compare two representative non-work-conserving disciplines proposed in the context of high speed networks: Stop-and-Go and Rate-Controlled Static Priority. Although both Stop-and-Go and RCSP can be used to provide statistical guarantees [10, 30], only deterministic performance guarantees are considered in this paper. <p> In addition, the delay bound allocations for each connection in different switches are coupled with one another. In [9], a connection has to have the same frame size in all the switches. In <ref> [31] </ref>, a looser requirement is presented: the frame times of a connection along the path should be non-decreasing. None of these restrictions apply to RCSP. <p> Delay-EDD scheduler is used, and the (Xmin; Xave; I; Smax) traffic model is adopted, the amount of buffer space required at the i th switch along the path traversed by the connection is P i Xmin Smax, where d k is the local delay bound at the k th switch <ref> [6, 31] </ref>. Stop-and-Go and RCSP require less buffer space not only inside the network, but also at the destination 13 node. <p> Among the work-conserving disciplines proposed are: Virtual Clock [32], variations of the Earliest-Due-Date algorithms [6, 13], and Generalized Processor Sharing [20]. All of them use a sorted priority queue mechanism <ref> [31] </ref>, which make it difficult to implement in high-speed switches. Also, in a network with work 18 conserving disciplines, more resources such as buffer space are needed in downstream switches due to traffic pattern distortions inside the network.

Reference-contexts: Hierarchical Round Robin [11] is a service discipline that also uses a multi-level framing strategy. It differs from Stop-and-Go in that it does not use synchronized framing structure across links, thus it cannot provide tight end-to-end delay-jitter bounds. Among the work-conserving disciplines proposed are: Virtual Clock <ref> [32] </ref>, variations of the Earliest-Due-Date algorithms [6, 13], and Generalized Processor Sharing [20]. All of them use a sorted priority queue mechanism [31], which make it difficult to implement in high-speed switches.
