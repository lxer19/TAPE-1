Abstract: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) plays an increasingly important role in statistical analysis. EDA is difficult, however, even with the help of modern statistical software. We have developed an assistant for data exploration, based on AI planning techniques, that addresses some of the strategic shortcomings of conventional software. This paper illustrates the behavior of the system, gives a high level description of its design, and discusses its experimental evaluation.

Reference-contexts: Aide's partial hierarchical design is an effective framework for mixed-initiative planning. James Allen has identified three distinguishing characteristics of mixed-initiative planning, by analogy to dialog behavior. Mixed-initiative planners support flexible, opportunistic control of initiative, the ability to change focus of attention, and mechanisms for maintaining shared, implicit knowledge <ref> [1] </ref>. We can adapt these criteria to our design as follows. The plan library provides the planner its representation of shared knowledge about reasonable courses of action, while the network of focus points gives the current state of the exploration.

Reference-contexts: Our goals for Aide are similar to those adopted by other researchers interested in the use of planning in intelligent user interfaces. Bonar and Liffick, for example, use planning to support novice users without unduly constraining experts, and vice versa <ref> [2] </ref>. Planning is an integral part of many agent-based user interfaces [4, 7]. As an integration of reactive planning methods and user interface technology, Aide is an example of the potential benefits of this approach.

Reference-contexts: Aide concentrates on a different aspect of the same problem, on representing the process of exploration. The knowledge discovery in databases literature also describes systems comparable to Aide, for example Brach man et al.'s Imacs, which is aimed at the task of "data archaeology" <ref> [3] </ref>. Data archaeology is distinct from data mining, in which an autonomous statistical or machine learning algorithm searches a large database for implicit patterns.

Reference-contexts: paper ends with a brief account of an experimental evaluation of the system. (a) Initial relationship (b) Resistant fit EXPLORING DATA We can best understand Aide's behavior with an example, which we take from an experiment with Phoenix, a simulation of forest fires and fire-fighting agents in Yel-lowstone National Park <ref> [6] </ref>. The experiment involved setting a fire at a fixed location and specified time, then observing the behavior of the fireboss (the planner) and the bulldozers (the agents that put out the fire).

The clearest relationship is to early work in developing concepts of statistical strategy, or the formal descriptions of actions and decisions involved in applying statistical tools to a problem <ref> [11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Beyond providing access to conventional statistical operations, Aide gives the user an explicit representation, through the focus point network, of the decision-making process. This kind of explicit, structured justification for decisions and results is an important aspect of exploration <ref> [12] </ref>. Further, the network lets the user explicitly direct Aide's actions. When Aide reaches a focus point, its decision at that point can be reviewed and potentially modified by the user. In fact, all decisions made by the user or the system are available for review and possible revision.

Reference-contexts: The planner may opportunistically revisit and modify focus point decisions in order to follow the most promising path to a solution. This kind of planning is well-suited to exploration. EDA makes use of abstraction, problem decomposition, and procedural knowledge, three defining characteristics of planning <ref> [13] </ref>. Further, EDA is reactive. One cannot anticipate every pattern that might possibly appear in the data; rather, the analysis is driven by the data, which argues for integrating the generation and execution of procedures. In addition, exploratory procedures often need explicit control.

Reference-contexts: An automated system will inevitably make mistakes from time to time, so its reasoning process (past decisions as well as current ones) must be available to the user for approval or modification. A responsiveness to the guidance provided by human knowledge of context has been termed "accommodation" <ref> [14] </ref>. An accommodating system takes advantage of human knowledge to augment its own necessarily limited view of the world. <p> Gale and Pregibon's Rex system, for example, implemented a strategy for linear regression [8].
