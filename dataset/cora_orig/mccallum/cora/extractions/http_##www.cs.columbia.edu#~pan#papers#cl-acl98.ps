Title: Learning Intonation Rules for Concept to Speech Generation

Abstract: In this paper, we report on an effort to provide a general-purpose spoken language generation tool for Concept-to-Speech (CTS) applications by extending a widely used text generation package, FUF/SURGE, with an intonation generation component. As a first step, we applied machine learning and statistical models to learn intonation rules based on the semantic and syntactic information typically represented in FUF/SURGE at the sentence level. The results of this study are a set of intonation rules learned automatically which can be directly implemented in our intonation generation component. Through 5-fold cross-validation, we show that the learned rules achieve around 90% accuracy for break index, boundary tone and phrase accent and 80% accuracy for pitch accent. Our study is unique in its use of features produced by language generation to control intonation. The methodology adopted here can be employed directly when more discourse/pragmatic information is to be considered in the future. This paper is published in the proceedings of the COLING-ACL 98.

Reference-contexts: For example, in <ref> (Bachenko and Fitzpatrick, 1990) </ref>, a set of hand-crafted rules are used to determine discourse neutral prosodic phrasing, achieving an accuracy of approximately 85%. Recently, researchers improved on manual development of rules by acquiring prosodic phrasing rules with machine learning tools.

Reference-contexts: Recently, researchers improved on manual development of rules by acquiring prosodic phrasing rules with machine learning tools. In (Wang and Hirschberg, 1992), Classification And Regres sion Tree (CART) <ref> (Brieman et al., 1984) </ref> was used to produce a decision tree to predict the location of prosodic phrase boundaries, yielding a high accuracy, around 90%. Similar methods were also employed in predicting pitch accent for TTS in (Hirschberg, 1993).

Reference-contexts: Many CTS systems were simplified as text generation followed by TTS. Others that do integrate generation make use of the structural information provided by the NLG component <ref> (Prevost, 1995) </ref>. However, most previous CTS systems are not based on large scale general NLG systems. 4 Modeling Intonation While previous research provides some correlation between linguistic features and intonation, more knowledge is needed.
