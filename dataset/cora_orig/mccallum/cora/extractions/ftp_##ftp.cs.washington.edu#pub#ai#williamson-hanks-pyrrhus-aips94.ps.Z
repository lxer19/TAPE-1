Abstract: Our work extends the definition of plan quality to take into account partial satisfaction of the goal and the cost of resources used by the plan, while at the same time building an effective planning algorithm by This paper presents Pyrrhus, an extension to the ucpop planning system (Barrett et al. 1993) that finds optimal plans for a class of goal-directed utility models suggested by Haddawy and Hanks (Haddawy & Hanks 1993). Our empirical results suggest that optimal plans can be generated effectively by a planner using domain-specific heuristic knowledge, and furthermore that the planner can use the same knowledge as a goal-satisfying planner to solve corresponding optimization problems.

Reference-contexts: By finding a complete plan more quickly, Pyrrhus can establish a higher greatest lower bound on utility, allowing it to prune more partial plans before they are expanded. Pyrrhus inherits its heuristic search control mech- anism from ucpop <ref> (Barrett et al. 1993) </ref>. It is a rule-based production system, inspired by that of prodigy (Minton et al. 1989), and allows specification of declarative domain-dependent rules to control the choice of which plans to expand and which flaws to fix. <p> For comparative purposes, Pyrrhus can be made to function as a classical goal-satisfying planner, in which it is just given a symbolic goal instead of a utility model. In this mode, Pyrrhus operates like UCPOP <ref> (Barrett et al. 1993) </ref>, except for the exten sions to handle metric preconditions and effects. Our basic methodology was to compare optimal planning to classical planning in our domain. Experiment One We constructed a suite of 13 classical (atemporal) planning problems of varying difficulty for this domain.

Reference-contexts: Etzioni (Etzioni 1991) advocated the use of decision theory for making control decisions, but was not doing planning in that methods for achieving each goal were specified in advance. Similarly, optimization techniques from the field of operations research <ref> (Bradley, Hax, & Magnanti 1977) </ref> generally require prespecified alternatives, and are not amenable to knowledge-based problem-solving techniques such as symbolic search control.

Reference-contexts: The Pyrrhus planning system Given a planning problem composed of an initial state description and a PSTC utility model, we would like an algorithm that can find an optimal plan. Of course, given that classical planning is intractable even under limiting assumptions <ref> (Bylander 1991) </ref>, and considering that PSTC optimal planning is at least as hard as classical planning, 2 we cannot expect any algorithm to perform well on all problems.

Reference-contexts: Increasing the search limit showed that 56305 plans would have to be explored to solve this problem, making it about one order of magnitude harder than classical planning. Related and future work Feldman and Sproull <ref> (Feldman & Sproull 1977) </ref> were among the first to suggest the use of decision theory in AI. They suggested the essential idea of using bounds on utility to guide the planning process, but they focused on the representation of uncertainty, leaving their utility model relatively undeveloped.

Reference-contexts: Action Representation The underlying planning mechanism of Pyrrhus is based on the ucpop planning system (Penberthy & Weld 1992; Barrett et al. 1993), which is itself derived from the snlp causal-link planner <ref> (McAllester & Rosenblitt 1991) </ref>. Pyrrhus uses the ucpop 2.0 action representation language for variablized operator schemata, including universal quantification and conditional effects. We made extensions to provide (rudimentary) support for time and metric resources.

Reference-contexts: Pyrrhus inherits its heuristic search control mech- anism from ucpop (Barrett et al. 1993). It is a rule-based production system, inspired by that of prodigy <ref> (Minton et al. 1989) </ref>, and allows specification of declarative domain-dependent rules to control the choice of which plans to expand and which flaws to fix. The antecedents of the rules match characteristics of the plans and/or flaws under consideration, and the consequents assert preferences among those candidates.

Reference-contexts: Experimental Results We are evaluating Pyrrhus using a number of experiments in a simplified transportation planning domain inspired by the Truckworld planning testbed <ref> (Nguyen, Hanks, & Thomas 1993) </ref>. The domain consists of a graph of locations connected by roads of various lengths. Some of the roads are toll roads, requiring payment in cash before use. A robot truck is given tasks of delivering objects between various locations in the world.

Reference-contexts: A threatened link is a causal link whose condition may conflict with an effect of some clobbering step. Threatened-link flaws are fixed by adding plan step ordering constraints or variable binding constraints to prevent the conflict from occurring. See <ref> (Weld 1994) </ref> for a detailed description of least-commitment planning with causal links. Establishing dominance The difference between Pyrrhus and a goal-satisfying planner is that while the latter can stop as soon as a complete (flawless) plan is found, the former cannot.
