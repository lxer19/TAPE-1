Abstract: In radiosurgery a beam of radiation is used as an ablative surgical instrument to destroy brain tumors. Treatment planning consists of computing a sequence of beam configurations for delivering a necrotic dose to the tumor, without damaging healthy tissue or particularly critical structures. In current systems, kinematic limitations severely constrain beam motion. This often results in inappropriate dose distributions. A new radiosurgical system has been implemented to overcome this disadvantage. In this system, a compact radiation source of high energy is moved by a 6-dof robotic arm. We describe algorithms for computing a motion with specified characteristics for this new system. Treatment plans used at test sites with earlier systems are compared to plans computed with the described algorithms. The experience reported shows that full kinematic flexibility combined with treatment planning algorithms allows for better protection of healthy tissue and higher dosage in tumors.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In radiosurgery, brain tumors (and other brain malformations) are destroyed by moving an intense beam of radiation <ref> [2, 6] </ref>. A necrotic dose is delivered to a tumor by cross-firing from multiple directions, to reduce the amount of energy deposited in healthy tissue. <p> In many cases, cross-firing at a single center is not appropriate (fig. 1-b, where B is a critical region). Furthermore, dose uniformity in the tumor is desirable. Excessive dose in some regions ("hot spots") may cause complications and should be avoided. Earlier systems for radiosurgery (Gamma-Knife, LINAC-System <ref> [2, 6, 7, 8] </ref>) are restricted to a single isocenter treatment procedure, where all beams converge at a single point (the isocenter). This results in approximately spherical dose regions, i.e. a sphere around the isocenter will receive high dose. The example in Fig. 1-a illustrates this type of treatment.

In our method, we can obtain a more accurate model by representing a beam as a series of p concentric cylinders. In the inequalities, the variables for the added cylinders occur with decreasing coefficients. The beam fluence also decreases with depth traveled in tissue [8].

In <ref> [10] </ref> we proposed a geometric approach that consists of treating critical regions as obstacles that the radiation beam is not allowed to traverse.

To allow for comparison we considered cases which previously had been treated with the LINAC-system. For spherical tumors, the methods in <ref> [10] </ref> give satisfactory results. Hence, we considered all cases which ical distribution, axial cross-sections) had been treated at the Stanford Medical Center in the first quarter of 1993, in which more than one sphere was used to approximate the tumor. In total there were 12 such cases.

Reference-contexts: Selection of beam configurations: The first step of our planning approach consists of selecting beam configurations. We implemented and experimented with several techniques for this selection. The best results were obtained with the following technique. Using an algorithm in <ref> [12] </ref>, a grid of n points is selected on the tumor surface. At each such point, a direction is randomly chosen on the upper half of a unit sphere in 3D, with uniform distribution. A second method for selecting beam configurations was implemented in the planning system.
