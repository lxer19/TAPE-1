Title: A User's Guide for the CADYF-SPLIB Project  
Author: Xiaoge Wang Randall Bramley 
Date: June 19, 1995  
Address: Bloomington  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Indiana University  
Abstract: The CADYF-SPLIB project is a continuing effort to develop practical linear system solver strategies for difficult problems from incompressible flows in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CADYF is a Fortran package for solving steady state incompressible flows using the finite element method. The package was developed and directed by Dominique Pelletier of Ecole Polytechnique in Montreal. SPLIB is a heavily instrumented package for solving large, sparse nonsymmetric systems of equations. SPLIB consists of 13 iterative methods and 7 preconditioners, developed and implemented by Randall Bram-ley and Xiaoge Wang at Indiana University. This report is a user's manual describing the interface between CADYF and various linear solver packages, including SPLIB. Beginning in 1989, a collaborative effort began between research groups at Ecole Polytechniqe in Montreal and the Center for Supercomputer Research and Development at the University of Illinois. Later, with the move of Randall Bram-ley to Indiana University followed by the award of an Indiana based NSF CISE Postdoctoral Fellowship to Xiaoge Wang, the second group was centered in the Computer Science Department of Indiana University. The Montreal research group fl Supported by NSF Grant CDA-9309746
