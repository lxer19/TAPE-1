Abstract: We present an investigation of the architecture of an optoelectronic cache which can integrate terabit optical memories with the electronic caches associated with high performance uni- and multi processors. The use of optoelectronic cache memories will enable these terabit technologies to transparently provide low latency secondary memory with frame sizes comparable to disk-pages but with latencies approaching those of electronic secondary cache memories. This will enable the implementation of terabit memories with effective access times comparable to the cycle times of current microprocessors. The cache design is based on the use of a smart-pixel array and combines parallel free space optical I/O to-and-from optical memory with conventional electronic communication to the processor caches. This cache, and the optical memory system to which it will interface, provides for a large random access memory space which has lower overall latency than that of magnetic disks and disk arrays. In addition, as a consequence of the high bandwidth parallel I/O capabilities of optical memories, fault service times for the optoelectronic cache are substantially less than currently achievable with any rotational media.

Reference-contexts: Key to the successful design of such a system is the resolution of architectural issues such as the address translation mechanism, frame size at each level, write policy, replacement algorithms, and coherency support mechanism <ref> [6] </ref>. By utilizing an optoelectronic cache memory we can resolve both these architectural issues, as well as provide the necessary technology interface, and thus provide a seamless optoelectronic memory hierarchy which is compatible with modern uni- and multi-processor computing systems.
