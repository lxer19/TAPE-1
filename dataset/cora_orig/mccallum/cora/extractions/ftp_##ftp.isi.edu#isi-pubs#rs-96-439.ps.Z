Reference-contexts: Psychology has also given us descriptions and theories of robust regularities, i.e. behaviors that all people seem to exhibit. It has contributed regularities about motor behavior (e.g. Fitts' Law <ref> (Fitts, 1954) </ref>, which predicts how long it will take a person to move a pointer from one place to a 2 target location as a function of the distance to be traveled and the size of the target), about item recognition (e.g. that the time to decide whether a test item

Reference-contexts: a number of more interesting content theories to the field, including: NL-Soar, a theory of human natural language (NL) comprehension and generation (Lehman, Lewis, & Newell, 1991; Rubinoff & Lehman, 1994) that has been used to explain many results from psycholinguistics, including the garden path phenomenon discussed in Section 1 <ref> (Lewis, 1993) </ref>. SCA, a theory of symbolic concept learning that acquires and retrieves category prediction rules (e.g. if you see something round and small that rolls, predict it is a ball) (Miller, 1993).

Reference-contexts: SCA, a theory of symbolic concept learning that acquires and retrieves category prediction rules (e.g. if you see something round and small that rolls, predict it is a ball) <ref> (Miller, 1993) </ref>. SCA mirrors psychological data along the dimensions of response time, accuracy and learning rate as a function of various instance and category structures. NOVA, a theory of visual attention whose performance matches human data from a number of distinct experimental results in the psychology literature (Wiesmeyer, 1992).

Reference-contexts: other Soar projects have focused on variations of that goal, producing models such as: NTD-Soar, a computational theory of the perceptual, cognitive, and motor actions performed by the NASA Test Director (NTD) as he utilizes the materials in his surroundings and communicates with others on the Space Shuttle launch team <ref> (Nelson, Lehman, & John, 1994) </ref>. NTD-Soar combined NL-Soar and NOVA with decision making and problem solving knowledge relevant to the testing and preparation of the Space Shuttle before it is launched. Instructo-Soar, a computational theory of how people learn through interactive instruction (Huffman, 1993).

Reference-contexts: out on the table, how do we know that there is any set of pieces that will allow us to recover the big picture? The only way, Newell argues, is to go ahead and try to put the whole picture together, to try to build unified theories of cognition (UTCs) <ref> (Newell, 1990) </ref>. So, around 1980, Newell and two of his students (the second and third authors of this chapter) began working on Soar, a candidate UTC. <p> Because every architecture is a theory about what is common to the content it processes, Soar is a theory of what cognitive behaviors have in common. In particular, the Soar theory posits that cognitive behavior has at least the following characteristics <ref> (Newell, 1990) </ref>: 1. It is goal-oriented. Despite how it sometimes feels, we don't stumble through life, acting 6 in ways that are unrelated to our desires and intentions.

The other disciplines mentioned above have also described and theorized about regularities in human cognition. How can the expert contributions of all these fields be a problem? The problem arises not because of the regularities, but because of the theories.
