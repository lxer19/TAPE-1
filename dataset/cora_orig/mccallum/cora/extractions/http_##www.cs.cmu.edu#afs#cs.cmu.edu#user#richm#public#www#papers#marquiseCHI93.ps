Abstract: Unlike many previous tools which concentrate on widgets, Marquise is aimed mostly at the main drawing window of Marquise is a new interactive tool that allows virtually all graphical editors where the user creates and manipulates of the user interfaces of graphical editors to be created by graphical objects with a mouse. For example, with Mar-demonstration without programming. A ``graphical quise you can demonstrate how the rubber banding will editor'' allows the user to create and manipulate graphical appear as you move the mouse, rather than having this as a objects with a mouse. This is a very large class of interface. Although ``mode-free'' interfaces are often editors, and many CAD/CAM programs. The primary in-touted, all modern graphical interfaces are in fact highly novation in Marquise is to allow the designer to moded. For example, in most drawing tools such as demonstrate the overall behavior of the interface.

The interactive tool uses the framework objects that will be created.
