Title: Towards A Generic Monitor For Cooperation  
Author: Eugnio Oliveira, Long Qiegang 
Address: Portugal  
Affiliation: Faculty of Engineering University of Porto  
Abstract: This paper introduces a Blackboard-based Monitor which is used to control cooperative agents in multi-agent systems. We argue that this Monitor is generic since it not only supports different styles of cooperation but also supports sophisticated local task scheduling which is necessary for real-time applications. Even more important, all the domain-dependent knowledge needed for making these two kinds of reasoning possible, is dynamically accessed during runtime. These features make our Monitor to be an effective as well as general control frame.
