Abstract: Birds, fish, and many other animals travel as a flock, school, or herd. Animals in these groups must remain in close proximity while avoiding collisions with neighbors and with obstacles. We would like to reproduce this behavior for groups of simulated creatures traveling fast enough that dynamics plays a significant role in determining their movement. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for controlling the movements of creatures that travel as a group and evaluate the performance of the algorithm with three simulated systems: legged robots, humanlike bicycle riders, and point-mass systems. Both the legged robots and the bicyclists are dynamic simulations that must control balance, facing direction, and forward speed as well as position within the group. The simpler point-mass systems are included because they help us to understand the effects of the dynamics on the performance of the algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Wang proved that the error in desired position relative to actual position diminishes to zero for each independent robot in the formation and therefore the desired formation is asymptotically stable. Takeuchi, Unuma, and Amakawa <ref> (1992) </ref> implemented path planning in simulated multi-agent systems where the attraction between agents is dependent on properties of the agents. The simulated agents are Newtonian particles where forces are applied to the agents based on the vector sum of attractions to other observable agents. <p> Arkin explored the question of communication in a group of interacting mobile robots in the laboratory using schema-based reactive control ((Arkin, 1992), <ref> (Arkin and Hobbs, 1992) </ref>). Example schemas are move-to-goal, move-ahead, and avoid-static-obstacle. Each behavior computes a velocity vector that is combined with the velocity vectors from the other behaviors. The combined velocity vector is used to control the robot.

Reference-contexts: The robots utilize the knowledge that they are all identical when executing behaviors, but an extension to these results found that heterogeneous agents do not perform significantly better than homogeneous ones <ref> (Mataric, 1993) </ref>. In these experiments, a hierarchy is created in which an ordering between the agents determines which agent will move first in completing such tasks as grouping and dispersing. <p> In these experiments, a hierarchy is created in which an ordering between the agents determines which agent will move first in completing such tasks as grouping and dispersing. Parker <ref> (1993) </ref> investigated the advantages and disadvantages of using local and global knowledge when designing control laws for cooperative agent teams. Simulated wheeled robots were used to explore the tradeoffs in tasks where the robots are commanded to move in formation.

Reference-contexts: Biologists have found that herding benefits group members by limiting the average number of encounters with predators (data summarized in Veherencamp <ref> (1987) </ref>). Group behaviors also allow animals to hunt more powerful animals than those they could overpower as individuals. The success of behaviors such as these in biological systems argues the merit of exploring their use in robotic systems. <p> The success of behaviors such as these in biological systems argues the merit of exploring their use in robotic systems. An understanding of these behaviors is essential for realistic creatures in virtual environments. Early progress in the simulation of group behaviors was made by Reynolds <ref> (1987) </ref>. Actors in his system are birdlike objects similar to the point masses used in particle systems except that each bird also has an orientation. <p> Reynolds's work demonstrates that realistic-looking animations of group formations can be created by applying simple rules to determine the behaviors of the individuals in the flock. Yeung and Bekey <ref> (1987) </ref> proposed a decentralized approach to the navigation problem for multiple agents. Their simulation system first constructs a global plan without taking into account moving obstacles. When a collision is imminent, the system locally replans using interrobot communication to resolve the conflict.
