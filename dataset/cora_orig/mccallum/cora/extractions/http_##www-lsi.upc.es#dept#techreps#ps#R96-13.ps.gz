Reference-contexts: In fact, the possibility of adding this kind of tautologies in the analytic tableaux is a well-known idea in the tradition of classical proof theory, as described e.g. in <ref> [BELL77] </ref>. It has also been suggested by Hintikka in his interrogative model of inquiry (see e.g. [HINT81], [HINT86], [HINT92]), in which he models the process of scientific inquiry with plays of the interrogative game, which is a game played by the Inquirer and Nature.

Reference-contexts: analytic tableaux method, simply by analysing the same clauses that had been analysed to proof the derivability of f. 20 The third subtableau would be immediately closed because it would contain both p and :p in its left column. 21 Hintikka uses the classical Beth-style analytic tableaux, as described in <ref> [BETH55] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In the AI literature most authors deal with these problems by introducing impossible possible worlds, e.g. possible worlds where logical connectives do not behave in the usual way, or tautologies may not be true, or inconsistent formulas may hold (see e.g. impossible possible worlds in [HINT75], non-classical worlds in <ref> [CRES72] </ref>, non-standard worlds in [RESC79] or situations in [LEVE84]). These semantic approaches somehow alleviate the problems of logical omniscience and perfect reasoning, but they cause different problems (see e.g. [McAR88], [REIC89] for detailed reviews of these and other approaches).

Reference-contexts: subset of them (call that a context), it can draw conclusions which are consistent within the context but inconsistent if all the beliefs are considered (as remarked by Shoham in [SHOH91]; Fagin and Halpern modelled this situation in their logic of local reasoning, [FAHA85]; Delgrande also considered this idea in <ref> [DELG95] </ref>). * It is indeed possible to define interesting procedures of inquiry over inconsistent sets of beliefs (as shown e.g. in [RESC79]). * The situation where no tautological information is believed could model ([JASP94]) for instance the initial state of information in the environmentalist tabula rasa the ories of Locke and

Reference-contexts: Some arguments against logical omniscience and perfect reasoning could be the following: * The agent can be unaware of certain facts (Fagin and Halpern tried to take this fact into account in their logic of general awareness, <ref> [FAHA85] </ref>). * The agent can have limited resources (e.g. the time required or the space needed to perform a given inference). <p> every inference; if it focuses in a subset of them (call that a context), it can draw conclusions which are consistent within the context but inconsistent if all the beliefs are considered (as remarked by Shoham in [SHOH91]; Fagin and Halpern modelled this situation in their logic of local reasoning, <ref> [FAHA85] </ref>; Delgrande also considered this idea in [DELG95]). * It is indeed possible to define interesting procedures of inquiry over inconsistent sets of beliefs (as shown e.g. in [RESC79]). * The situation where no tautological information is believed could model ([JASP94]) for instance the initial state of information in the environmentalist

Reference-contexts: The main problem is that modelled agents are logically omniscient (they believe all classical tautologies) and perfect reasoners (their beliefs are closed under classical deductive closure). These properties could be appropriate if the agent's designer wished to model ideal agents (e.g. the children in the muddy children puzzle, see <ref> [FHMV95] </ref>), but they are clearly inadequate if more realistic (human or computational) agents are considered.

Reference-contexts: Some authors (see e.g. <ref> [HALP86] </ref>) argue that, in this case, there seems to be no way to make a knowledge-based analysis of the agent's beliefs.

These logics are modal logics (see [HUCR68], [JANS90]) in which the necessity operator is interpreted as belief.

In the logical analysis the agent generates a sequence of accessibility relations (see <ref> [MORE95a] </ref>, [MORE95b], [MORE95c]); each of them (via the standard Kripke semantics) defines a different set of beliefs.

This kind of ideas can be pushed even further, when the use of different tautologies is considered (see <ref> [MORE95b] </ref> for a preliminary study of the use of different instances of AEM and different tautologies in the logical analysis). <p> In the future work these constraints will be studied to discover which (instances of) tautologies yield interesting sets of deductive consequences. Another key issue in this research will be the study of the interaction between the two strands of analysis (see <ref> [MORE95b] </ref> for a preliminary study of these topics).
