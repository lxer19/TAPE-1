Reference-contexts: Coarse-grain models represent a connection between the microscopic world and macroscopic observations and correspond to the level of our knowledge about the physical processes. Coupled map lattice theory grew out of studies on collective movements of coupled oscillators <ref> [1] </ref>. CMLs with local, direct-neighbour coupling can be regarded as approximations to the diffusion process. <p> The stability condition of the coherent attractors in the globally coupled lattice is given by <ref> [1] </ref>: 0 + log (1 ") &lt; 0 (8) where 0 is the Lyapunov exponent of a single map. For the logistic function with a=1.99 and 0 = 0.6892, the stability condition is " &gt; " fl = 0.4980. <p> The main reason of the problems is the more complicated structure of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Jacobians with intermediate-range coupling. For globally coupled maps, there is a leading eigenvalue, while the other N-1 eigenvalues are identical and represent an (N-1)-fold degeneracy <ref> [1] </ref>. The eigenvector belonging to the first eigenvalue is uniform, therefore, an amplification along this eigenvector cannot destroy the coherence [1]. <p> For globally coupled maps, there is a leading eigenvalue, while the other N-1 eigenvalues are identical and represent an (N-1)-fold degeneracy <ref> [1] </ref>. The eigenvector belonging to the first eigenvalue is uniform, therefore, an amplification along this eigenvector cannot destroy the coherence [1]. In the case of intermediate coupling, we still have a leading eigenvalue and a corresponding uniform eigenvector [1; 1; : : : ; 1] T 1= p This can be shown using quite straightforward algebra. <p> The eigenvector belonging to the first eigenvalue is uniform, therefore, an amplification along this eigenvector cannot destroy the coherence [1]. In the case of intermediate coupling, we still have a leading eigenvalue and a corresponding uniform eigenvector <ref> [1; 1; : : : ; 1] </ref> T 1= p This can be shown using quite straightforward algebra. The remaining N-1 eigen-values, however, will not be identical, i.e., there is no (N-1)-fold degeneracy in CMLs with intermediate-range coupling. Alternative ways of system analysis have to be explored in this case.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, low-dimensional collective behaviours are observed at these parameters as well. The relatively large Lyapunov exponents (&gt; 0.2) show that this low-dimensional collective behaviour is essentially different from the non-trivial quasi-periodic oscillations found previously <ref> [2] </ref>. * Similar phenomena have been described at higher space dimensions [6-8]. Our results are obtained in one-dimensional lattices which is very advantageous from a computational viewpoint.

Reference-contexts: Coupled map lattice theory grew out of studies on collective movements of coupled oscillators [1]. CMLs with local, direct-neighbour coupling can be regarded as approximations to the diffusion process. Globally coupled maps are related to mean-field interactions and they are defined as <ref> [3] </ref>: x n+1 (i) = (1 ")f (x n (i)) + N k=1 where x n (i) is the field value at location i and time step n; i = 1; : : : ; N; N is the size of the one-dimensional lattice.

Reference-contexts: The presence of low-dimensional collective behaviours in spatially extended systems is a controversial issue. Contrary to earlier theoretical studies predicting the absence of global collective behaviours in the case of semi-localised coupling, quasi-periodic collective dynamics has been observed in such systems <ref> [6, 9-10] </ref>. Further studies showed that the onset of macroscopic collective behaviour can be attributed to the window structure of the bifurcation maps [11-12]. 3 In this Letter the importance of intermediate-range effects is emphasised.

Reference-contexts: Results obtained with studying intermediate-range coupling in CMLs are directly related to the emergence of intelligent behaviour in neural networks. 2 Experiments with intermediate-range coupling 2.1 Background The work introduced in the present Letter is closely related to the research by Sinha, Biswas, Azam and Lawande <ref> [10] </ref> who analysed the effect of increasing extent of coupling using a one-dimensional lattice of logistic maps. When the number of coupled chaotic elements increases, a collective behaviour appears in the form of well-defined peaks in the power spectra of the mean field oscillations. <p> These results link our studies with previous works on intermediate-range coupling <ref> [10, 12] </ref>. We have conducted a systematic study of coupled maps for a wide range of parameters: system size N, extent of coupling K, coupling strength ", and control parameter a. In the studies, periodic boundary condition has been used. <p> In Figure 1 (a), is depicted as the function of K for two " values. In the case of " = 0.1, the K versus curve is approximately linear in accordance with previous observations <ref> [10] </ref>. For " = 0.14, however, a more complicated curve is observed. Namely, increases slowly at first, followed by a quick growth at K values between 100 and 200. Finally, increases only slightly when K is large.
