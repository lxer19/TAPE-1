Title: Introducing Active Managed Objects for Effective and Autonomous Distributed Management  
Author: Anastasia Vassila and Graham J. Knight 
Address: College London, UK  
Affiliation: University  
Abstract: In this paper, we criticise the manager agent model as it is used in current systems, and propose a powerful solution towards flexible management by introducing Active Managed Objects (AMOs) which are remotely programmable entities that carry out management tasks locally; these tasks are defined using a scripting language. We examine the notion of an AMO system, describe its architecture and present some early results. We finally attempt to place the concept within the TMN[1] infrastructure.

Reference-contexts: The selection mechanisms of CMIP <ref> [7] </ref> can be used in order to retrieve the required attribute values from the managed system effectively, but the algorithms are executed in the manager node, while threshold and event reporting mechanisms cannot be used as b is a threshold devised by the local administration and is not specified in the

Reference-contexts: Consequently, it is a reasonable consideration to migrate more of the management intelligence to managed systems in order to tackle the problems noted above. This is not an entirely novel approach; in the SNMP world we see RMON <ref> [8] </ref> boxes gathering low level network status variables and OSI have defined monitor metric objects [9] that are bound to attributes or whole managed objects and perform statistic calculations to help analyse the performance of the system, and emit notifications when certain thresholds are exceeded.

However, RMON boxes make calculations on a per packet basis and cannot be used for high level management calculations.

Reference-contexts: By representing the programmable agent as a managed object in the MIB, data can be acquired from other MOs in the system without violating encapsulation <ref> [10] </ref>. AMOs can also exchange information with each other at their MO boundary. . The managing application can control the execution and operation of the AMO using normal management operations, without the need for the devel opment of a specialised interface.

Reference-contexts: Options. The existing choices for an appropriate MPL are numerous and can variate in structure, functionality and pertinence. We can choose between compiled and interpreted languages, general purpose and special purpose ones (management languages as in <ref> [11] </ref>). In [12] there is a detailed analysis of existing programming styles in respect to the requirements of an active database. Our requirements are not that strict, so we can allow our system to adopt an imperative programming style as opposed to more expensive and complex ones.

The AMO concept could be realised to operate in a distributed object management architecture like a CORBA <ref> [15] </ref> platform, when such a system seems powerful enough to provide the mechanisms that an AMO requires (powerful selection methods and naming schemes).

In this paper we argued that it is needed to migrate management intelligence closer to the managed resources in order to reduce traffic specific to management and make reaction to management activities more immediate.
