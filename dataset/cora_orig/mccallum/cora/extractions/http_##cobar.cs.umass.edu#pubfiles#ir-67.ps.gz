Abstract: Harvard Community Health Plan is exploring emerging information technologies for means to use the text portion of its 25 year old computerized medical record system. The Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval is developing systems to answer the question: to what extent can automated information systems replace manual chart review of encounter notes? INQUERY, a probabilistic inference net information retrieval system, and FIGLEAF, an inductive decision tree text classifier are applied to the problem of classifying electronic encounter notes to identify acute exacerbations in pediatric asthmatics. Both systems achieve average precisions of greater than 80%, with a new enhancement to INQUERYs relevance feedback the top performer. Refinement of the systems and plans for their integration are discussed.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Harvard Community Health Plan (HCHP) is a large Boston-based health maintenance organization, which has benefited from computerized medical records since its founding 25 years ago. The Automated Medical Record System (AMRS) contains essentially the complete medical record more than 300,000 current members <ref> [1] </ref>. The data within AMRS is a strategic resource for both quality improvement and utilization management. The coded portions are used extensively. However, the text portion of the AMRS resource is inaccessible and virtually ignored, with the exception of resource-intensive manual chart review for quality measurement and research.

Reference-contexts: A user presents INQUERY with a query either in INQUERY query language or in natural language and then has the option after viewing the retrieved documents of marking some of them as relevant. INQUERY can then use these relevance judgments to expand the initial query and improve retrieval performance <ref> [2] </ref>. The current task is a novel one for INQUERY due to the small collection size and the large number of relevance judgments.

Reference-contexts: the underlying model of probabilistic inference nets is robust enough to provide good performance. 1.3 FIGLEAF - AN INDUCTIVE TEXT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM The FIGLEAF (FIne Grained Lexical Analysis Facility) text classification system, currently under development, bases its classification on decision trees derived from examples in a set of training documents <ref> [3] </ref>. Each document to be classified is encoded as a list of feature-value pairs and is passed to an ID3 decision tree, which returns a probability that the document is a positive instance.

Reference-contexts: Decision trees are automatically induced from training instances using the ID3 decision tree algorithm. Each node in the decision tree is a test for the value of a feature. ID3 selects the test that most effectively separates positive and negative training instances, using an information gain metric <ref> [4] </ref>. Features are recursively selected to partition the training instances. After the tree has been built, pruning off branches near the leaves generally improves performance. Pruning thresholds must be empirically determined for each tree.

Reference-contexts: Before the automated code-based filter, 4.4% of both training and testing collections were acute exacerbations 2.2 INQUERY It has been shown that a variety of user defined conceptual query paths can be used on pediatric asthma data with varying degrees of success <ref> [5] </ref>. For the current experiment, the best previously identified conceptual query path, that of asthma medications, route and effects, was used. The initial query was run against PA_TEST to establish a baseline result. <p> Additional meta-features were created from terms and phrases supplied by five of the conceptual query paths (asthma medications, routes, effects, as well as symptoms and hospitalization) previously prepared for the asthma domain <ref> [5] </ref>. Finally, statistical analysis was used to define lists of terms most highly correlated with relevant and with irrelevant documents, forming the basis of further meta-features.
