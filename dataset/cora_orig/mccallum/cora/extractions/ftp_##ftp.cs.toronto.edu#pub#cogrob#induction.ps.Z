Abstract: In the situation calculus, it is sometimes necessary to prove that certain properties are true in all world states accessible from the initial state. This is the case for some forms of reasoning about the physical world, for certain planning applications, and for verifying integrity constraints in databases. Not surprisingly, this requires a suitable form of mathematical induction. This paper motivates the need for proving properties of states in the situation calculus, proposes appropriate induction principles for this task, and gives examples of their use in databases and for reasoning about the physical world.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The situation calculus [8] is enjoying new popularity these days. One reason is that its expressiveness is considerably richer than has been commonly believed (Gelfond, Lifschitz and Rabinov <ref> [2] </ref>, Pinto and Reiter [10], Schubert [16]). Another is the possibility of precisely characterizing the strengths and limitations of various general theories of actions expressed within its formalism (see Lin and Shoham [7], Lifschitz [5] and Reiter [12] for examples).

Reference-contexts: One concern of this paper is how an agent might derive such facts from some background situation calculus axiomatization. 2.2 Planning The standard logical account of planning views this as a theorem proving task (Green <ref> [3] </ref>): To obtain a plan whose execution will lead to a world state s in which the goal G (s) will be true, establish that Axioms j= (9s):S 0 s ^ G (s): Sometimes we would like to establish that no plan could possibly lead to a given world state. <p> Notice that these sentences are universally quantified over states, in contrast to the standard theorem-proving account of plan synthesis (Green <ref> [3] </ref>), which requires proofs of sentences existentially quantified over states. Not too surprisingly, proving such universally quantified sentences requires mathematical induction.

For the purposes of invoking the induction principles of Section 3 to prove properties of world states, it is irrelevant how the frame axioms are represented, so long as they are available, whether explicitly or implicitly.

For example, * Salaries are functional: No one may have two different salaries in the same database state. * No one's salary may decrease during the evolution of the database. <p> Using this axiomatization, our objective is to prove properties of all states accessible (via some finite sequence of possible actions) from S 0 , 3 This definition should be contrasted with those in Reiter <ref> [11, 13] </ref>. It seems that there is not a unitary concept of integrity constraint in database theory, and that there are many subtleties involved. 7 for example, sentences like (1), (2) and (3).

Reference-contexts: How do databases change? One way is via predefined update transactions, e.g. * Change a person's salary to $. * Register a student in a course. We shall assume that such transactions provide the only mechanism for database state changes. Following Reiter <ref> [14, 15] </ref>, we propose that databases be represented in the situation calculus; updatable relations will be fluents, i.e. they will take a state argument. Moreover, update transactions will be treated exactly like actions in the AI planning domain, so that transactions will be functions.
