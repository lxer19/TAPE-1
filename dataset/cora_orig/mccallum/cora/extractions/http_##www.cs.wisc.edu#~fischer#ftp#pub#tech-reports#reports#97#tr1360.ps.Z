Abstract: In this paper we examine preconditioning operators for regular elliptic systems of partial differential operators. We obtain general conditions under which the preconditioned systems are bounded. We also provide some useful guidelines for choosing left and right preconditioning operators for regular elliptic systems. The condition numbers of the discrete operators arising from these preconditioned operators are shown to be bounded independent of grid spacing. Several examples of the two-dimensional regular elliptic systems are discussed, including scalar elliptic operators and the Stokes operator with several different boundary conditions. Several preconditioners for these regular elliptic systems are presented and used in numerical experiments illustrating the theoretical results.

Reference-contexts: Manteullel and Parter [9] discussed the preconditioning and boundary conditions for scalar elliptic operators in the plane. They obtained necessary and sufficient conditions for the condition numbers of preconditioned operators to be bounded in the L 2 and H 1 norms. With the ideas of Bramble and Pasciak <ref> [2] </ref>, they extended the results to discrete preconditioned operators arising from the preconditioned differential operators. They showed that the condition numbers of these discrete preconditioned operators are bounded independent of grid spacing. We extend their ideas to regular elliptic systems.

We can obtain a unique solution p 2 H 1 () from the equation u x + v y + p = g for any g 2 H 1 (). Therefore P (1) is one-to-one and onto. Similarly, P (2) and P (3) are one-to-one and onto.

Reference-contexts: Grisvard <ref> [5] </ref> has shown that the traction (Neumann) problem of linear elasticity is a regular elliptic system on open bounded convex polygonal domains. It is likely that the Stokes operator with the stress boundary condition is a regular elliptic system on any open bounded convex polygonal domains. <p> By standard results, E is one-to-one and onto on H 2 () (see Grisvard <ref> [5] </ref>). Hence, we don't need to modify E.

Reference-contexts: Therefore P (1) is one-to-one and onto. Similarly, P (2) and P (3) are one-to-one and onto. Since P (i) is one-to-one and onto, we don't need to modify P (i) , i.e., ^ P (i) = P (i) . Grisvard <ref> [6] </ref> has shown that the above properties of Stokes equations are still true on convex polygonal domains. Also, the properties of above preconditioners are valid on convex polygonal domains (see Grisvard [7]). Therefore, the above discussion is still valid on convex polygonal domains. <p> We can get a unique solution p 2 H 1 from the equation u x + v y + p = g: Therefore, P 1 is one-to-one and onto on (H 2 ; H 2 ; H 1 ). Grisvard <ref> [6] </ref> has shown that the Laplacian operator with mixed boundary conditions is a regular elliptic operator on open bounded convex polygonal domains with all corners having interior angle less than or equal =2 and 0 and 1 meet at the corners.

Reference-contexts: For the linear systems that arise in this way, iterative solution methods are used and a wide variety of these are available. These iterative procedures can be accelerated by choosing good preconditioners for the linear systems. In this paper we extend the idea of Manteullel and Parter <ref> [9] </ref> that examining preconditioning operators for the differential system provides insight into choosing good precon-ditioners. Whereas Manteullel and Parter [9] consider only a single elliptic equation, we consider elliptic systems. <p> These iterative procedures can be accelerated by choosing good preconditioners for the linear systems.

This result lessens the restrictions on boundary conditions discussed in Manteuffel and Parter <ref> [9] </ref>. On the other hand, it is hard to imagine that we can find weaker conditions such that ^ P 1 ^ E, ^ E 1 ^ P , ^ E ^ P 1 , and ^ P ^ E 1 are well-defined, one-to-one, onto, and bounded.

Reference-contexts: We show the condition numbers of left and right preconditioned operators are bounded with respect to more general norms. The main idea is to use norms that are natural for the boundary operators. Moreover, we can use the results of Martin <ref> [10] </ref> to extend the above results to finite difference schemes such that if the condition numbers of the preconditioned operators are bounded, then the condition numbers of the discrete preconditioned operators arising from the finite difference schemes are also bounded independent of grid spacing. <p> We first state the theorem which was proved by Martin <ref> [10] </ref>.

This proves (3.2).

Reference-contexts: By the above properties, the preconditioned operators P 1 E and EP 1 are one-to-one and onto. From the ADN estimates, P 1 E and EP 1 are bounded operators (we 5 show this later). Therefore, iteration methods such as GMRES (m) <ref> [12] </ref> will be efficient for the preconditioned operators P 1 E and EP 1 . Notice, if P has different order t 0 , 0 , or 0 , then the preconditioned operators P 1 E or EP 1 are not bounded. <p> The regularized central difference scheme was developed by Strikwerda [13]. The initial condition was that the initial iterate was zero inside the domain. We use the GMRES (m) <ref> [12] </ref> method for the iteration method, and take m = 7 for all experiments. Each solution procedure was terminated when the minimized residual was less than 10 6 .

Reference-contexts: Each solution procedure was terminated when the minimized residual was less than 10 6 . The inversions of the Laplacian operator for preconditioning are accomplished by the Fourier method for polar coordinates and the Fast Poisson Solver of <ref> [15] </ref> for Cartesian coordinates. Both of methods solve the discrete Laplacian operator directly by taking the Fourier transformation to reduce the original problem to a tridiagonal system, and using the Thomas algorithm to solve this system.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that the solution of this system is unique to within an additive constant for pressure (see Temam <ref> [16] </ref>). Hence, K (E) =&lt; (0; 0; 1) T &gt;. Also, the solution exists under the constraint Z g = Z div (u; v) = @ Z (b 1 ; b 2 ) ~n on the range. Hence the co-dimension of the range is 1. Therefore, index (E) = 0.

Since E is self-adjoint, we have dim (kernel E) = dim (kernel E fl ): Therefore, codim (range E) = dim (kernel E); and hence, index (E) = 0.
