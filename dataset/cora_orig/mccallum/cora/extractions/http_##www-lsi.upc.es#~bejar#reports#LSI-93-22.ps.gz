Abstract: In this work we present a classification methodology (LINNEO + ) to discover concepts from ill-structured domains and to organize hierarchies with them. In order to achieve this aim LINNEO + uses conceptual learning techniques and classification. The final target is to build knowledge bases after expert validation. Some techniques for the improvement of the results in the classification step are used, like biasing using partial expert knowledge (classification rules or causal and structural dependencies between attributes) or delayed cluster assignation of objects. Also some comparisons with a few well-known systems are shown.

Reference-contexts: As has been said in xA, objects are represented as vectors of length p, being p the number of descriptors. Position i of object j shows the symbolical or numerical value of descriptor i . The numerical values are normalized to the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref> in order to avoid the influence of the different scales. <p> The reason for the use of this kind of similarity measure is that it is very simple to compute and it treats equally the symbolic and the numerical data, because the value of the similarity of each attribute is always in the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. This allows to mix the two kind of attributes and to study the influence that have in the description of the data. The center of a class i is obtained by calculating the mean value for each quantitative attribute of every object.

Reference-contexts: This knowledge (that will be called Domain Theory (DT)) is represented as set of rules. See xB, for more details. Starting with this knowledge and data, LINNEO + uses induction over the observations to generate a classification (see <ref> [2] </ref>). The induction process is biased by the DT. If no DT is available the system works unbiased. This idea was stated but not developed in previous works [19]. The expert evaluates the results and eventually modifies some aspects of his DT in order to reclassify it. <p> The above algorithm is complemented with others strategies that allow refining the DT (if available) or generating one from the dataset if needed. Also, LINNEO + could give a whole set of different descriptions and information about the classification (see <ref> [2] </ref>). As other conceptual clustering methodologies LINNEO + 's results may depend on the order in which data is presented ([12]). The availability of a DT will reduce this effect.

Reference-contexts: Also, it is possible to include problems derived from (a) ordering: discovered clusters may differ depending on the order in which objects are presented to the system (see [12]), (b) the inclusion of nought values (see <ref> [3] </ref>), (c) the use of structured descriptions and (d) the treatment of missing values (see [37]). <p> an accepted classification LINNEO + tries to generate classification rules using the notion of potential utility of an attribute respect of all the data set, or assuming that a class contains all the available positive information about it and calculate the potential utility of the attributes respect of that class <ref> [3] </ref>, [24]. This gives local information about the role of an attribute in the task of classifying an object, that belongs to a given domain, into a specific class. After this process LINNEO + generates classification rules which can be used in a knowledge-based system, in this case MILORD [30]. <p> modalities and 0 otherwise. * if k is a quantitative attribute, it is the absolute val ues of their difference. * if some of the attributes has the status of nought value the value is 1=2 if only one of them has this status, or 0 if are both (see <ref> [3] </ref>). The reason for the use of this kind of similarity measure is that it is very simple to compute and it treats equally the symbolic and the numerical data, because the value of the similarity of each attribute is always in the interval [0; 1]. <p> E. Using Potential Utility LINNEO + also could use the potential utility of each attribute to construct a partial order of the utility of attributes <ref> [3] </ref>. This allows the system to try to add new attributes to an expert's rule to specialize it, or to generate rules that could be used as explained in the previous section.

Reference-contexts: With these ideas in mind we decided to use the classical concept of distance as a fuzzy similarity value <ref> [4] </ref>. As has been said in xA, objects are represented as vectors of length p, being p the number of descriptors. Position i of object j shows the symbolical or numerical value of descriptor i .

Reference-contexts: In both cases the system is capable of generating classification rules for the construction of a Knowledge-base for Second-Generation Expert Systems [34]. LINNEO + has been tested with several real dataset in different domains giving good results (see [26] [30] <ref> [7] </ref>) And also compared with other systems using well-known datasets with a high degree of performance. A great advantage of LINNEO + over other systems is the characterization of the classes. So the human espert is able to understand why the objects are clusterd together and build-up an explanation.

Reference-contexts: In this study the behavior of the plant along 527 days has been considered. The dataset was originally recorded to be used with the K-means algorithm <ref> [14] </ref> and its adaptation to be used with LINNEO + did not caused extra work to the expert. The original classification was obtained after setting the radius to 5 and without the DT. The results were 13 meaningful classes (at the taxonomical level of "situation" [31][32]). <p> The results are used to construct a knowledge base for the automatic control and supervision of the waste-water plant and reported in [31] and [30]. The same dataset was studied using K-means algorithm <ref> [14] </ref> and some of those results are described in the next section. <p> The classes that correspond to abnormal situations are almost iddentical in both classifications. The normal situations are clustered different, but all the classes show few differences. See <ref> [14] </ref> for more details. 8 V. Conclusions LINNEO + , as shown, implements a methodological automatic knowledge acquisition process from observational dataset in ill-domains. It has some advantages, as to allow the use of quantitative and qualitative attributes in the same dataset.

Reference-contexts: The number of classes using COBW EB goes from 12 to 20. It is believed that the number of classes in the dataset is 19, but there are 4 ones that have so few objects that only 15 are useful <ref> [21] </ref>. B. K-means versus LINNEO + We have used the K-means algorithm implemented in the Sysstat package with the euclidean distance in order to classify the wastewater-treatment data and compare the results. The experts chose 13 as the most suitable number of classes.

They are COBW EB [10] and the K-means algorithm implemented in the software Systat with an euclidean distance [15]. <p> Altogether, LINNEO + has good performance as shown in section xIV, its computational cost is reasonable, and we have test it with quite big datasets, as for example in <ref> [27] </ref>. The size and type of the dataset (only quantitative, only qualitative or both types of attributes together) do not affect LINNEO + performance. LINNEO + presents two major drawbacks: 1.

Reference-contexts: There has been experimented different values for the ff-yet parameter and has been found that only values in the range [0:6; 0:8] are useful <ref> [28] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This gives local information about the role of an attribute in the task of classifying an object, that belongs to a given domain, into a specific class. After this process LINNEO + generates classification rules which can be used in a knowledge-based system, in this case MILORD <ref> [30] </ref>. Rules can be validated using new observations not previously included in the sample. <p> It is important to choose those observations considered relevant for the modelization of the domain. They are intended to cover all the possible prototypical cases, more specially when the number of available observations is low. The system is able to extract observations directly from a data stream (see <ref> [30] </ref>). For each observation, a vector is defined whose length is just the number of attributes. <p> In the case of wishing another kind of objective, another set of rules would be taken in consideration, introducing a different kind of bias. The results are used to construct a knowledge base for the automatic control and supervision of the waste-water plant and reported in [31] and <ref> [30] </ref>. The same dataset was studied using K-means algorithm [14] and some of those results are described in the next section. <p> In both cases the system is capable of generating classification rules for the construction of a Knowledge-base for Second-Generation Expert Systems [34].

Reference-contexts: While COBW EB builds a hierarchy of classifications, LINNEO + builds a single classification. Bejar and Talavera studied some algorithms to create hierarchies from classifications <ref> [35] </ref>. The differences are the algorithms themselves. COBW EB algorithm makes a search, with hill-climbing strategy, through a classification hierarchy space giving a hierarchy as result, while LINNEO + places objects and classes over a n-dimensioned hyper-space giving one single classification of a certain generality.
