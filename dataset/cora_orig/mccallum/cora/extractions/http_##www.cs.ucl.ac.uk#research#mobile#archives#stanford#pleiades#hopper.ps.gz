Abstract: This paper presents a novel location management technique, HOPPER, that is designed to support in a scalable and efficient manner non-geographical (lifelong) personal numbers in Personal Communications Services (PCS). Performance comparisons between our scheme and other schemes are derived from large scale simulations using a realistic traffic modeling framework for the ten largest cities of the United States. Results show that, in addition to inherently providing non-geographical numbers, the proposed scheme significantly improves lookup performance and requires relatively little database access and network signaling resources.

Reference-contexts: If LCM R i;j exceeds a certain threshold, R min , DB j is a candidate for replicating i's profile because the benefit of replication outweighs its costs. [5] proposes R min = 5 for caching, and [19] suggests R min = 0:25 for off-line replication in HLR/VLR. <ref> [11] </ref> proposes two thresholds: R min and R max for off-line replication. R min is set in such a way that if LCM R i;j is below it, there is definitely no gain in replicating at DB j . <p> Similarly, R max is set so that if LCM R i;j exceeds it then it is always advantageous to replicate at DB j . <ref> [11] </ref> also discusses optimal values for R min and R max given off-line traffic statistics and the database topology. Unfortunately, unlike off-line schemes, it is not possible to derive optimal thresholds for on-line techniques without more statistical knowledge of user traffic behavior. <p> These assumptions correspond to the best possible scenario for the number translation scheme, and we ignore all updates and signaling activities associated with maintaining such a translation database at every VLR in the network. * HIPER. We simulate off-line replication with HIPER (N ,L) <ref> [11] </ref>. We set N = 5 to allow a maximum of five replicas per subscriber. We set L = 3 to allow replicas to be placed anywhere in our 4-level database hierarchy.
