Abstract: For VLSI application-specific arrays and other regular VLSI circuits, two techniques are available for yield enhancement, namely defect-tolerance and layout modifications. In this paper, we compare these two yield enhancement approaches by using adders as an example. Our yield projections indicate that the layout modification technique is more efficient when the defect density is low, while reconfiguration is more efficient for a high defect density. However, from the point of the view of effective yield, the layout modification is superior to defect tolerance in the practical range of defect density.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Numerous techniques for incorporating redundancy into regular VLSI arrays in order to increase their manufacturing yield have been proposed <ref> [1] </ref>. Most of these techniques attempt to minimize the area overhead by taking advantage of the regular structure of such arrays. Another approach for yield enhancement of VLSI circuits is based on layout modification techniques which attempt to minimize the sensitivity of the layouts to fabrication defects (e.g.,[2]).

Reference-contexts: In addition to the three types of adders reported in [3]-[5], i.e., ripple-carry, Manchester, and carry-skip, we found that carry-select and conditional-sum <ref> [6] </ref> are also good candidates when the criteria of area overhead and percentage of reconfigurable circuitry are considered. 1 This work was supported in part by NSF under contract MIP-9305912.

Reference-contexts: In order to calculate the yield, we used the negative binomial yield model under the large area clustering assumption, with an average of faults per unit area and a clustering parameter of ff. Under this model, the yield of an adder without redundancy is <ref> [7] </ref>: Y = Y 0 (1 + A c =ff) ff (1) where Y 0 is the gross yield factor and A c is the critical area. For a 16-bit adder with one spare slice, the yield estimation is slightly more complex. <p> Here, we need to distinguish between the reconfigurable part and the nonreconfigurable part. The nonreconfigurable part includes power and ground lines, switching circuitry, etc. Each fault occurring in the nonreconfigurable part can cause a chip-kill fault <ref> [7] </ref>. Let A ck denote the critical area of the nonreconfigurable circuit, and A cm denote the critical area of a standard one bit module. Then the yield of the defect-tolerant adder is [7][8]: Y = Y 0 M=16 where a M;N = P rob [Exactly M out of the N

Reference-contexts: To simplify the calculation, we also assume that all the three short-circuit type defects have the same density and that it is 10 times as high as the density for the three open-circuit type defects <ref> [10] </ref>, which are also assumed to have the same density. We further assume a clustering parameter ff = 1 and a gross yield factor Y 0 = 98%. Using formulas (1) and (2), we can calculate the yield of the five types of adders under different defect densities.
