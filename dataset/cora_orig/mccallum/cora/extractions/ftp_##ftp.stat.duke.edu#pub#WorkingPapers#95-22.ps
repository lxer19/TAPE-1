Reference-contexts: Note that N is conditionally independent of y N , given N : Standard theoretical results for DLMs therefore apply, and the conditional posterior for all N state vectors N may be sampled using the forward-filtering, backward-sampling algorithm <ref> (Fruhwirth-Schnatter 1994, Carter and Kohn 1994) </ref>. This is briefly detailed in Appendix A, and full details appear in the above references. As in the application in West (1995), we may modify the basic MCMC algorithm to avoid high-dimensional matrix inversions.

Reference-contexts: We refer to our new models as the class of conditionally Gaussian dynamic models. For a single time series of compositions, the observations at each time point follow conditional multinomial distributions whose defining parameters, after appropriate non-linear transformations, are modeled according to a traditional dynamic linear model <ref> (West and Harrison 1989) </ref>; the latter structure generates the "conditionally Gaussian" terminology. This provides a framework for flexibly modeling structured and stochastic time-variation in multinomial proportions, and for developing hierarchical model components to adequately represent relationships across categories. <p> Fairly standard, conditionally conjugate forms, such as usually adopted in DLM analyses <ref> (West and Harrison 1989) </ref> are used in the example below. Specifically, we assume that 0 ; W; V 1 ; : : : ; V I are mutually independent, with 0 having a specified normal 9 prior, and the V i having a common inverse Wishart prior. <p> For identification, we constrain these offset parameters to zero sum by allowing the first I 1 to vary freely, and defining fl It = P I1 i=1 fl it : Time variation in the underlying levels is modeled using standard trend components, assumed to follow a (bivariate) third-order polynomial function <ref> (West and Harrison 1989, chapter 7) </ref>. <p> These analyses <ref> (as in West and Harrison 1989, chapter 15) </ref> were run independently for each grade i; and resulting posteriors generated values used to initialize the full model analysis.
