Abstract: In this paper we present the work we are doing to realize efficient C++ libraries for the data parallel programming paradigm. This work has two goals: one is the realization of efficient libraries, the other is to build an efficient runtime environment for the data parallel language High Performance Fortran. We decided to use an object-oriented approach for the development and so it was natural to choose C++ as programming language. C++ is widely used and it is possible to find good compilers for almost all the architectures. Moreover it provides good mechanisms for the realization of libraries. The C++ properties of data-abstraction and information hiding have allowed us to rapidly prototype and validate an implementation of the model of data decomposition. Following the same lines we wrote ParLib++ and we are writing HPParLib++. Both libraries are described herein. Key words: Data Parallel Programming, C++, High Performance Fortran fl complete work
