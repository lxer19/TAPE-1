Abstract: Since the mid-1980s, researchers have been pursuing the goal of neurosymbolic integration, i.e., the construction of systems capable of both symbolic and neural processing. We distinguish two major avenues toward this goal: the united and the hybrid approaches. Whereas the united approach claims that full symbol processing functionalities can be achieved via neural networks alone, the hybrid approach is premised on the necessity and complementarity of symbolic and neural structures and processes. This paper attempts to clarify and compare the assumptions, mechanisms as well as the open problems of both approaches.

Reference-contexts: Localist models A connectionist architecture for rule-based reasoning and variable binding is described in <ref> [1] </ref>. Knowledge is represented in a localist fashion using several types of nodes: predicate nodes (for predicate names), role nodes (for predicate arguments or variables), and tller nodes (for possible role values). Rules are encoded by interconnection patterns between predicate and role nodes.

Reference-contexts: With neural preprocessing, development time was cut down from 3 to 2 months and accuracy rose from 74.5 % to 97.5 %. 2.2. Subprocessing In subprocessing mode, one of the two modules is embedded in and subordinated to the other, which acts the main problem solver. In innate/qualms <ref> [2] </ref>, the symbolic module is the main processor whose task is fault diagnosis in a distillation plant. It is a classical expert system linked to a simulation model of the process to be monitored.

Reference-contexts: An example of neural metaprocessing is a system in which the baselevel symbolic processor solves high school physics problems, and the connectionist component enforces search control <ref> [3] </ref>. Object-level rules encode equations such as velocity = initial-velocity + acceleration x time. If several of the needed variables are unknown, the metalevel connectionist module is called on to make a choice.

Reference-contexts: Metaprocessing In metaprocessing mode, one module is the baselevel problem solver and the other plays a metalevel role (such as monitoring, control, or performance improvement) vis--vis the trst. Symbolic metaprocessing is illustrated in the Robotic Skill Acquisition Ar--chitecture <ref> [4] </ref>. Its goal is to develop robots which accomplish complex tasks using designer-supplied instructions and self-induced practice. The architecture's base level is itself hybrid: a rule-base provides a declarative representation of human expert knowledge whereas neural networks embody reexive procedural knowledge that comes with practice.

Reference-contexts: In one example of symbolic preprocessing [9], decision trees are used as feature selectors to limit the number of input nodes in feedforward neural networks and thus accelerate the learning process. The reverse setup is neural preprocessing: in <ref> [5] </ref>, for instance, the main processor is a respiratory monitoring expert system which recommends actions to be taken to avoid breathing complications. Rules are of the form: If qualitative-state then action, where qualitative-state is a symbolic representation of a change in lung pressure over time (e.g., pressure is rising rapidly).

Reference-contexts: Attempts at nsi can be classited into two major approaches according to the particular blend of symbolic and neural structures and processors involved. In the united approach, more widely known as connectionist symbol processing (csp) <ref> [6] </ref>, neural networks are used as building blocks to create a cognitive architecture capable of complex symbol processing. The united approach is premised on the claim that there is no need for symbolic structures and processes as such: full symbol processing functionalities can be achieved using neural networks alone.

Reference-contexts: Neu-rosymbolic coprocessing has been applied to the improvement of arrhythmia diagnosis via intracardial detbrillators, devices implanted in people with heart disorders <ref> [7] </ref>. These devices detect abnormal rhythms or arrhythmias, which can be clustered into three groups depending on the type of action they call for: continue monitoring, pace the heart, or apply high-voltage electric shock. Classitcation accuracy is of course crucial in this application.

Reference-contexts: The hybrid approach is based on a psychologically plausible distinction between two types of cognitive operations: automatic, reexive or low-level (e.g., perception) vs controlled, deliberative or high-level (e.g., reasoning) <ref> [8] </ref>. Typically, in hybrid systems, reexive tasks are assigned to the connectionist subsystem and deliberative tasks to the symbolic subsystem.

Reference-contexts: We distinguish four integration modes: chainprocessing, subprocessing, metaprocessing and coprocessing. 2.1. Chainprocessing In chainprocessing mode, one of the moduleseither symbolic or neuralis the main processor while the other takes charge of pre and/or postprocessing tasks. In one example of symbolic preprocessing <ref> [9] </ref>, decision trees are used as feature selectors to limit the number of input nodes in feedforward neural networks and thus accelerate the learning process.

Reference-contexts: Pointer traversal is implemented via associative retrieval, and a connectionist maintenance system adds, deletes and updates memory triples. Fault tolerance and robustness are side benetts of this distributed representation: like biological networks, boltzcons will not crash abruptly if some cells cease to function. 3.3. Localist/distributed models consyderr <ref> [10] </ref> is a united system aimed at modelling common-sense reasoning (e.g., Can a duck y? A duck is like a sparrow, so I guess it can y.). It uses a dual but purely connectionist representation scheme.

Reference-contexts: However, the model has signitcant diculties in scaling up to complex, high-level reasoning; more importantly, it fails to give any convincing account of the learning process. 3.2. Distributed models boltzcons <ref> [11] </ref> uses distributed representations of linked lists to implement symbolic structures like trees and stacks. One cell of a linked list is encoded as a triple of symbols of form (tag, car, cdr).
