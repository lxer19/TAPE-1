Abstract: In many communication applications, sources generate data at a variable rate. This variation can be captured by a two-level model. At a larger time scale, the source alternates between a finite number of models at the higher level, while each model represents the local fluctuation at the smaller time scale. Typically the data goes through a lossy compression at the encoder, and then is entered into a buffer before being transmitted over a fixed-rate or a regulated-rate (e.g., Leaky Bucket) channel. Since the buffer size is finite, the choice of compression parameters must balance the tradeoff between the distortion due to lossy compression and the distortion caused by buffer overflow. As the optimal compression parameters may be different for each individual model, a method is needed to detect changes from one model to another. We show via examples that for many common traffic models, the problem of detecting changes in traffic statistics can be reduced to the following general change point detection problem: Let A 1 ; A 2 ; : : : be a series of independent observations such that A 1 ; A 2 ; : : : ; A m1 are i.i.d. distributed according to an unknown distribution F , and A m ; A m+1 ; : : : are i.i.d. distributed according to another unknown distribution G. m is the unknown change point. The objective is to determine that a change has occurred as soon as possible, while maintaining a low rate of false alarms. In this paper we propose a sequential nonparametric change point detection algorithm using Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics, and demonstrate that it is asymptotically optimal, in that under the constraint E[time until a false alarm] T , our algorithm is such that E[detection delay] = O(log(T )), as T ! 1. This property is known to be the best that can be achieved. Furthermore, unlike other nonparamet-ric schemes, the performance of the algorithm is independent of the distributions

Reference-contexts: Finally, from the implementation point of view, the scheme should require only a bounded number of operations and memory at each decision point. Several sequential nonparametric detection methods have been proposed previously. For a comprehensive review, see <ref> [2] </ref>. Most of these results are concentrated on the case in which the observed sequence is a concatenation of two i.i.d. random sequences, with some limited extension to n-dependent random sequences. Their common drawback, however, is the lack of the distribution-free property.

Reference-contexts: We show via examples how this algorithm can be applied in the context of detecting changes in incoming traffic for many common models. The statistic used in this case is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, which has the desirable property of being distribution-free [4]. This statistic has been used in <ref> [3] </ref> for the a posteriori change point problem, in which the emphasis is on accurate identification of the most likely point of change within a given set of observations. x3 presents the main theorem of the paper.

Reference-contexts: The proportion of the two priorities is controlled based on the source statistics as mentioned above. The buffer operates under a partial buffer sharing mechanism <ref> [5] </ref>, in which only high priority cells can enter the buffer when the occupancy is above a threshold. The data is emptied from the buffer through a leaky bucket before entering an ATM network. In this paper we address the issue of detecting changes in traffic statistics.

Reference-contexts: A finer compression reduces distortion, but generates more data and thus leads to higher overflow probability. Define the distortion-rate curve as the minimum distortion achievable by any scheme under an average rate constraint. Tse et al. <ref> [8] </ref> suggest that if the distortion-rate curve is concave at the channel rate R c , then one can achieve a lower distortion by timesharing between two compression schemes. <p> Then the objective is for the buffer overflow probability and the steady state average distortion when the buffer is not full to approach zero and D T (R c ), respectively, as the buffer size becomes large. The control scheme proposed in <ref> [8] </ref> places a threshold at the half point of the buffer, and uses a coarse compression with average rate R 1 &lt; R c when the buffer occupancy exceeds the threshold and a fine compression with rate R 2 &gt; R c otherwise.
