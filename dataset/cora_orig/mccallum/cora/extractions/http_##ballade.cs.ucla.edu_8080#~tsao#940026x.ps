Abstract: Figure 14: Examples showing that any Steiner tree T which violates condition (i), i.e., l(v) 62 mr(v) can be transformed into another tree T 0 such that T 0 satisfies condition (i), and cost(T 0 ) cost(T ). For convenience, we simply use p, v, a, and v to denote both the nodes and their original locations in tree T . Note that when the skew bound B = 1, all merging regions are rectangles (shown as the shaded regions). Since sink set S 0 is contained inside P S 0 , we can construct an MST T M and an SPT T S such that edges in E(T M ) and E(T S ) will not cross the edges in F . Let T K denote the KRY tree constructed using T M and T S as inputs. Since E(T K ) E(T M ) S
