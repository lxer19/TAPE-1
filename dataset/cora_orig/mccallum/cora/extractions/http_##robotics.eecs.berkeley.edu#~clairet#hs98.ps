Title: Synthesizing Controllers for Nonlinear Hybrid Systems  
Author: Claire Tomlin, John Lygeros, and Shankar Sastry 
Address: Berkeley CA 94720  
Affiliation: Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences University of California,  
Abstract: Motivated by an example from aircraft conflict resolution we seek a methodology for synthesizing controllers for nonlinear hybrid automata. We first show how game theoretic methodologies developed for this purpose for finite automata and continuous systems can be cast in a unified framework. We then present a conceptual algorithm for extending them to the hybrid setting. We conclude with a discussion of computational issues.

Reference-contexts: The derivation of equation (24) may be found in most textbooks on optimal control, for example, see <ref> [17] </ref>. We added the "min" to the right hand side of (24) for the same reason as in the discrete case: we want to ensure that only the UP of @G is propagated backwards, so that states which are once unsafe cannot become safe.
