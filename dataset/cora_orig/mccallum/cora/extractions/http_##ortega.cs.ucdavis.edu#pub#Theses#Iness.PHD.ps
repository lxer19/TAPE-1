Reference-contexts: Chapter 3 Elimination of All-Optical Cycles in WDM Networks 3.1 Introduction Wavelength-routed optical (wide-area) networks using wavelength cross-connects have been proposed for the purpose of providing transparent interconnection and wavelength reuse <ref> [1, 10] </ref>. Such a wavelength-routed optical network is being studied and demonstrated as a part of ARPA-sponsored programs at Bellcore (ONTC and MONET). The wavelength cross-connect switches may be implemented using acousto-optic tunable filters (AOTFs) or WDM multiplexer/demultiplexer-based technologies. The wavelength cross-connects may or may not include a wavelength-translation functionality.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, it is currently impossible to reliably route a signal through a switch twice. 7. We may design the network's physical connections such that "fl 0 cycles" are eliminated when switches are in default (BAR) state <ref> [2] </ref>. Alternatively, the network must have been previously designed this way. 3.3 Optical-Cycle Satisfying Conditions In order for an all-optical cycle, hereafter known as a white cycle, to be present in the network the following conditions have to be met: 1. A signal loop is present. <p> In a later section, we will discuss a method that places nodes in the middle of links, where there are no switches, to break all-optical cycles. 3.4 Initial Cycle-Breaking Solution This section builds on previous work <ref> [2] </ref>, and proposes network-layer solutions to the cycle problem that do not require any additional hardware. Our algorithms also handle the problems, due to crosstalk (leakage), that occur at the cross-connects.

Reference-contexts: Given a low-loss optical bandwidth of approximately 30 Terabits per second (Tbps) and a peak electronic processing speed of a few Gigabits per second (Gbps), innovative parallelism and concurrency mechanisms are needed to exploit this huge electro-optic bandwidth mismatch <ref> [4, 31, 32, 38] </ref>. WDM has emerged as the most promising choice since, unlike other alternatives, it only requires end-user equipment to operate at the bit rate of a WDM channel (peak electronic speed).

Reference-contexts: One of the first analytic results for wavelength conversion was presented in [41]. This paper derives lower bounds on the blocking probabilities for networks with and without wavelength converters. The results indicated that networks with wavelength converters offered lower blocking probabilities. Coincidentally in 1995, three separate studies <ref> [5, 8, 25] </ref> developed analytical models for networks utilizing full wavelength conversion. Each of these studies used different analytical techniques in developing the models, and therefore each makes unique contributions. In [5], simplifying traffic assumptions allow the authors to draw very general conclusions about networks with wavelength conversion. <p> The results indicated that networks with wavelength converters offered lower blocking probabilities.

Later, in [6], the model presented in [5] was modified, by incorporating poisson call arrivals and exponential holding times, in order to better match simulation results. Under appropriate parameters, this newer model can be used to evaluate the blocking probability of network designs where wavelength conversion is present, against the same designs when wavelength conversion is absent. <p> The results indicate that some networks do not need every node to be equipped with full conversion capabilities. In [50], the probabilistic analysis of <ref> [5] </ref> is extended to cover the case in which each of the converters is given a limited range it can "shift" an incoming wavelength. <p> The study finds that a limited-range converter can achieve most of the benefits of a full-range converter, even when the limited converter's range is only 25% of the range in a full-range converter. In [22], the probabilistic analysis of <ref> [5] </ref> is extended to the case of a network with multi-fiber links (i.e., switches connected by fiber "bundles" rather than single fibers). <p> As observed by other researchers, our study found the benefit from wavelength conversion | even when all nodes are given full conversion | to be only marginal in a ring. This is due to the high correlation between traffic on adjacent links (see <ref> [5] </ref> for an analytical explanation). However, these dynamic results contrast with the static case studied in [39]. Our dynamic results, in Fig. 4.7, show that one converter is not equivalent to full conversion at all nodes.

Later, in <ref> [6] </ref>, the model presented in [5] was modified, by incorporating poisson call arrivals and exponential holding times, in order to better match simulation results. <p> A segment has no opportunity for wavelength conversion, so the blocking probability on a segment can be be analyzed using a path blocking model developed in <ref> [6] </ref> for source-destination paths without wavelength converters.

The difference between the model and the simulation is quite pronounced on the left side of the plot.

This network architectural summary has been compiled from two documents published by the AON consortium <ref> [23, 6] </ref>, and the home page [52] of the AON consortium.

Appendix D Wavelength Conversion Results Utilized from Previous Work D.1 Accurate Blocking Probabilities with and without Wave length Converters This section briefly summarizes the models in <ref> [6] </ref>, for blocking in networks with and without wavelength converters. The model is meant to be applied to arbitrary mesh networks with (1) arbitrary fixed-path routing, (2) random wavelength assignment, and (3) Poisson call arrivals and exponential holding times. <p> The main approximation used in the derivation is that the carried load on a link is equal to the offered load (i.e., the blocking probability of the network should be small for these models to be valid). D.1.1 With Wavelength Converters The model in <ref> [6] </ref> for the network with wavelength converters is identical to the model for a conventional circuit switched network. <p> This approximation for P b (k; m) assumes that the distribution of link traffic follows a Poisson process, when in fact it follows a truncated Poisson process. D.1.2 Without Wavelength Converters The equations for the case without wavelength converters is significantly more complicated.

Reference-contexts: The measured tuning times, for this device, are less than 10 ns which makes it the fastest tunable laser available. Unfortunately, as is usually the case with fast tunable components, the tuning range is limited (10-15 nm expected <ref> [9] </ref>) and will probably support less than 10 channels. The "receiver" in a WDM network is an optical filter. The most promising tunable filters are the acoustooptic, electrooptic and the liquid crystal Fabry-Perot.

Reference-contexts: Several wavelength-assignment schemes have been proposed in the literature. Most researchers, who study wavelength conversion and assignment, prefer the First-Fit wavelength-assignment algorithm (described in Section 4.4.1) because of its simple implementation. This section will examine the assignment scheme that chooses the most busy wavelength, designated the PACK algorithm in <ref> [12] </ref>. Of all the wavelength-assignment schemes, PACK's performance is among the best. and it is described below. If at some point in the fixed-path there is a choice between more than one wavelength, the PACK algorithm chooses to use the wavelength that is the most heavily utilized throughout the network.

Reference-contexts: The "transmitter" in a WDM network is a laser. Semiconductor lasers can emit light on wavelengths in the entire useful gain spectrum of the semiconductor laser (as an example 1380 nm to 1620 nm for a certain multiple-quantum-well laser <ref> [17] </ref>). An optical filter adjacent to the lasing medium 3 reflects back only the desired "single" frequency and allows that frequency to gain in amplitude, within the lasing medium, and become a laser beam. Single-frequency lasers are needed in WDM design to minimize (1) wavelength spacing and (2) crosstalk. <p> Chapter 1: Introduction 4 testbeds and is readily available. Tuning range of this filter is from 1300 nm to 1.56 nm <ref> [17] </ref>, which allows tens of channels. The electrooptic filter uses crystals whose index of refraction is changed by current rather than sound, thus decreasing its tuning times. The tuning times for the electrooptic filter are on the order of a few nanoseconds. <p> The tuning times for the electrooptic filter are on the order of a few nanoseconds. Unfortunately, the tuning range is only about 16 nm which allows only about 10 channels <ref> [17] </ref>. Liquid crystal Fabry-Perot filters don't use a crystal as a grating, but instead change the index of refraction of the crystal in a reflective chamber to cause constructive interference for a particular wavelength. The liquid crystal Fabry-Perot filter is controlled using electric currents similar to the electrooptic filter.

Reference-contexts: It operates by using the principle of stimulated emission under which excited atoms give off photons at the wavelengths to be amplified. Semiconductor amplifiers amplify a wide range of signals including 1300 nm and 1550 nm <ref> [18] </ref>. Unfortunately, the signal from the source fiber must be directed into a very small region which is only about 1 m thick. This results in a significant loss of signal and is a challenging problem that must be solved before semiconductor amplifiers become feasible for use in WDM networks. <p> An EDFA is based on a pump laser exciting the erbium atoms in the amplifier medium which allows them to amplify wavelengths through stimulated emission.

Reference-contexts: By exploiting the transceiver tuning properties, one can construct either single-hop [31] or multihop [32] network architectures. GEMNET is a regular multihop network architecture, it is a generalization of shu*e exchange networks, it represents a family of network structures, and it includes the well-studied Shu*eNet <ref> [19] </ref> and de Bruijn graph [43] as members of its family. Fig. 2.1 (b) shows a multihop (logical) network (a 10-node GEMNET) embedded on the physical star topology network of Fig. 2.1 (a). <p> The generalization allows any number of nodes in a column as opposed to the constraint of P K nodes in a column <ref> [19] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: One promising method is to control the transmission spectra of tunable optical filters such that all wavelengths are input to the optical amplifier at the same power. This method has been demonstrated utilizing both Mach-Zehnder Interferometric filters <ref> [21, 48] </ref> and acousto-optic tunable filters [46]. However, these filters (attenuators) are costly and may only have a limited ability to "equalize" the input powers. <p> This model assumes that the amplifier is homogeneous 10 and has a flat gain over the wavelengths being amplified. A flat gain can be achieved through various techniques such as (1) notch filters [49], (2) different pump laser powers [15], (3) Mach-Zehnder filters <ref> [21] </ref>, and (4) demultiplexers and attenuators [14]. However, assuming that optical amplifiers are homogeneous is an approximation. More accuracy will require a model to be developed for the specific amplifier being deployed (e.g., EDFA).

Reference-contexts: Sparse (or Limited) Range Conversion: In this environment, the monetary costs and power budget can be reduced by limiting the conversion range of the wavelength converters [50]. For some wavelength-converter design technologies (e.g., wave-mixing-based approaches <ref> [23] </ref>), it is more efficient, in terms of power maintenance, to convert to wavelengths that are closer (in terms of GHz or nm) than to those that are farther away. 4.1.2 Technology Advances in wavelength-conversion technology have created a few distinct possibilities for performing wavelength conversion. <p> One limitation of this method is the lack of transparency (the receiver must understand the signal format being transmitted which violates transparency). * Amplifier-saturation-based wavelength conversion: One possible configuration of this device is shown in Fig. 4.4 (from <ref> [23] </ref>). In this conversion method, an input signal (f i ) and another laser's signal, which is tuned to the desired output wavelength (f j ), are sent through a gain-saturable amplifier. <p> Appendix C AON Architecture This appendix briefly introduces the All-Optical Network (AON) architecture that has emerged from the AON consortium 1 . This network architectural summary has been compiled from two documents published by the AON consortium <ref> [23, 6] </ref>, and the home page [52] of the AON consortium. Although the AON network is being developed with both WDM and TDM in mind, we will focus on the architectural aspects specific to WDM.

Reference-contexts: One of the first analytic results for wavelength conversion was presented in [41]. This paper derives lower bounds on the blocking probabilities for networks with and without wavelength converters. The results indicated that networks with wavelength converters offered lower blocking probabilities. Coincidentally in 1995, three separate studies <ref> [5, 8, 25] </ref> developed analytical models for networks utilizing full wavelength conversion. Each of these studies used different analytical techniques in developing the models, and therefore each makes unique contributions. In [5], simplifying traffic assumptions allow the authors to draw very general conclusions about networks with wavelength conversion. <p> In [8], the author develops an extremely accurate model for networks with wavelength conversion, but its applicability is somewhat limited due to its computational complexity (paths of at most three hops are examined). In <ref> [25] </ref>, the authors develop a fairly accurate 6 Interference length is the expected number of links shared by two connections which share at least one link. <p> Under appropriate parameters, this newer model can be used to evaluate the blocking probability of network designs where wavelength conversion is present, against the same designs when wavelength conversion is absent. In [47], the probabilistic analysis of <ref> [25] </ref> is extended to cover the case in which only a few nodes in the network are given full conversion capabilities. The results indicate that some networks do not need every node to be equipped with full conversion capabilities.

Reference-contexts: Through careful selection, equipping a fraction of the nodes with full conversion capabilities achieves most of the benefits of equipping all nodes in the network with full conversion capabilities. Sparse Switch-Output Conversion: This design attempts to reduce costs by limiting the number of wavelength converters at each node <ref> [27] </ref>. Nodes equipped with full conversion do not tend to utilize all their wavelength converters, and therefore a limited number can be installed at each node and still achieve most of the benefit of a node with full conversion capabilities. <p> The "sparser" the converters, the more the wavelength-continuity constraint impacts the network. 5 Subject to the constraint that a particular wavelength can appear only once on any output fiber. Chapter 4: Investigation of Sparse Wavelength Conversion 53 In <ref> [27] </ref>, a simulation-based study examined both full and sparse conversion. This study covered the shared-per-node and shared-per-link wavelength conversion switches (described later). Wavelength conversion is shown to improve both call blocking performance and fairness. <p> Figure 4.19 shows how the heuristic placement only diverges from the optimal placement at a few points, and when it does diverge, the blocking probability remains very close to the optimal. 4.5 Sparse Switch-Output Conversion 4.5.1 Different All-Optical Wavelength Conversion Switches Three promising all-optical wavelength-conversion switch designs <ref> [27] </ref> are illustrated in Figs. 4.6, 4.20, and 4.21. 15 Any traffic that is sourced or sinked by a node does not need to be wavelength converted by that node.

Reference-contexts: Even if the additional hardware proves to be too costly, this solution can be used as an absolute lower bound for the amplifier-placement problem in a broadcast network. 99 Chapter 5: Optical Amplifier Placement Schemes 100 (slightly modified version of that used in <ref> [28] </ref>). 5.1 Introduction 5.1.1 Network Environment An example of the class of networks that will be examined in this study is shown in Fig. 5.1, which shows a typical network topology for an optical local/metropolitan-area network (LAN/MAN). <p> The additional costs and limited effectiveness make network-engineered solutions (see below) appear promising for (1) completely dealing with near-far effects, or (2) assisting hardware solutions in dealing with near-far effects. Modified Problem | Network-Engineered Solutions Eliminating the Near-Far Effect The first study <ref> [28] </ref> eliminated the near-far effect through the careful engineering of amplifier placements. These placements forced all wavelengths in a fiber to be at the same power level 5 by controlling (1) the transmitters power, (2) the number of amplifiers and their placement, and (3) each amplifier's gain. <p> Chapter 5: Optical Amplifier Placement Schemes 104 function. Reducing the Total Amplifier Count: Equally-Powered Wavelengths In [36], the solution in <ref> [28] </ref> was improved upon by examining amplifier placements on a network-wide scale instead of a link-by-link scale. This was achieved by formulating the problem as an integer linear problem (ILP) 6 . <p> The following two subsections describe (1) the device specifications, and (2) the amplifier-gain model. 5.2.1 Device Specifications In order to allow comparisons between results obtained here and results obtained in previous studies, this study uses the same network parameters utilized in <ref> [28, 35, 36] </ref>.

We will now prove that a broadcast network, as in Fig. E.1, requires at least one amplifier between any pair of connected stars. First, arbitrarily pick two connected stars in the network and label them A and B.

Reference-contexts: This study was conducted for number of important reasons: to compare our simulation results with the observed results for full conversion in a ring network 8 , and to determine how effective sparse nodal conversion was in a ring network with dynamic traffic. In <ref> [39] </ref>, it is shown that, under the environment where the collection of lightpath requests to be set up are known in advance, full conversion placed at one node can gain the same benefit as full conversion placed at all nodes. <p> This is due to the high correlation between traffic on adjacent links (see [5] for an analytical explanation). However, these dynamic results contrast with the static case studied in <ref> [39] </ref>. Our dynamic results, in Fig. 4.7, show that one converter is not equivalent to full conversion at all nodes. The blocking probabilities continue to drop when more than one node is given full conversion capabilities.

Reference-contexts: GEMNET is a regular multihop network architecture, it is a generalization of shu*e exchange networks, it represents a family of network structures, and it includes the well-studied Shu*eNet [19] and de Bruijn graph <ref> [43] </ref> as members of its family. Fig. 2.1 (b) shows a multihop (logical) network (a 10-node GEMNET) embedded on the physical star topology network of Fig. 2.1 (a). <p> Equation (2.7) also matches the average hop distance formula for Shu*eNet [19] and the upper bound for de Bruijn graph <ref> [43] </ref> when appropriate values for P , N , and K are used (see Appendix A.2). <p> Equation 2.10 matches the formula for Shuf-fleNet [19] and the lower bound for de Bruijn graph <ref> [43] </ref> when appropriate values for P , N , and K are used (see Appendix A.3). The largest potential difference between the maximum and the minimum average hop distance occurs when P = 2, K = 1, and N (= M fi K) is large (see Appendix A.3. <p> A = (a 1 ; a 2 ; :::; a D ) will connect to node B = (b 1 ; b 2 ; :::; b D ) iff b i = a i+1 ;a i ; b i 2 0; 1; :::; P 1; 1 i &lt; D 1 <ref> [43] </ref>. Due to the constraints M = P D and K = 1, the number of nodes is N = M fi K = P D , so condition (1b) holds. <p> Substituting the appropriate de Bruijn graph parameters (K = 1, N = M fi K) into Eq. (A.3) gives: h max;DB = (N 1)(P 1) This result matches the upper bound for de Bruijn graph given in <ref> [43] </ref>. A.3 Lower Bound On Average Number of Hops in a GEM NET This appendix illustrates the derivation of the GEMNET lower bound formula.

We define fl 0 as the remaining set of wavelengths in the amplifier spectrum, excluding the set fl k . We will examine AOTF cross-connects <ref> [44] </ref> and other types of wavelength cross-connects for the way they treat the build up of ASE from the EDFAs. 3.1.1 Wavelength Cross-Connect Switches The transmission properties of the AOTF cross-connect are depicted in Figures 3.2 (a) and 3.2 (b).

Reference-contexts: The tuning time of the liquid crystal Fabry-Perot filter is currently about 10 s but sub-microsecond times are expected. Also, a tuning range of 30-40 nm at the 1550 nm operating range has been achieved <ref> [45] </ref>. Signal regeneration is essential for a WDM system that has to traverse long distances. Amplifiers allow a wide range of signals to regenerate without regard to the format of the signal, unlike repeaters 5 .

Reference-contexts: One promising method is to control the transmission spectra of tunable optical filters such that all wavelengths are input to the optical amplifier at the same power. This method has been demonstrated utilizing both Mach-Zehnder Interferometric filters [21, 48] and acousto-optic tunable filters <ref> [46] </ref>. However, these filters (attenuators) are costly and may only have a limited ability to "equalize" the input powers. The additional costs and limited effectiveness make network-engineered solutions (see below) appear promising for (1) completely dealing with near-far effects, or (2) assisting hardware solutions in dealing with near-far effects.

Reference-contexts: Three notions of sparseness are introduced below: Sparse Nodal Conversion: This design reduces costs by giving only a few nodes in the network "full" conversion capabilities <ref> [47] </ref>. Through careful selection, equipping a fraction of the nodes with full conversion capabilities achieves most of the benefits of equipping all nodes in the network with full conversion capabilities. Sparse Switch-Output Conversion: This design attempts to reduce costs by limiting the number of wavelength converters at each node [27]. <p> Under appropriate parameters, this newer model can be used to evaluate the blocking probability of network designs where wavelength conversion is present, against the same designs when wavelength conversion is absent. In <ref> [47] </ref>, the probabilistic analysis of [25] is extended to cover the case in which only a few nodes in the network are given full conversion capabilities. The results indicate that some networks do not need every node to be equipped with full conversion capabilities. <p> Due to the limited benefits achieved by wavelength conversion in a ring network, other networks will be pursued in the rest of this study. 4.2.3 Networks to be Studied In a previous study <ref> [47] </ref>, wavelength conversion offered more gains to randomly-generated mesh networks as compared to regular 11 networks. It is also envisioned that WANs will evolve and expand in irregular ways, preventing them from maintaining a true regular structure. <p> One method to reduce costs is to employ sparse nodal conversion | full conversion at a limited number of nodes. Sparse nodal conversion was first examined in <ref> [47] </ref>, where regular topologies and some randomly generated topologies, were shown to perform adequately using only sparse nodal conversion. This section attempts to (1) determine the benefits of sparse nodal conversion in realistic WANs, and (2) select exactly which nodes should be equipped with sparse nodal conversion.

Reference-contexts: This model assumes that the amplifier is homogeneous 10 and has a flat gain over the wavelengths being amplified. A flat gain can be achieved through various techniques such as (1) notch filters <ref> [49] </ref>, (2) different pump laser powers [15], (3) Mach-Zehnder filters [21], and (4) demultiplexers and attenuators [14]. However, assuming that optical amplifiers are homogeneous is an approximation. More accuracy will require a model to be developed for the specific amplifier being deployed (e.g., EDFA).

Reference-contexts: Sparse (or Limited) Range Conversion: In this environment, the monetary costs and power budget can be reduced by limiting the conversion range of the wavelength converters <ref> [50] </ref>. <p> In [47], the probabilistic analysis of [25] is extended to cover the case in which only a few nodes in the network are given full conversion capabilities. The results indicate that some networks do not need every node to be equipped with full conversion capabilities. In <ref> [50] </ref>, the probabilistic analysis of [5] is extended to cover the case in which each of the converters is given a limited range it can "shift" an incoming wavelength. <p> This section examines if limited-range conversion achieves most of the benefit of full-range conversion. In <ref> [50] </ref>, an initial study of full-conversion networks employing limited-range wavelength converters found that "regular" full conversion networks employing sparse-range conversion achieved most of the benefit of full-range conver Chapter 4: Investigation of Sparse Wavelength Conversion 89 different number of wavelength converters in the ring-connected network (node-sharing-switches, 25-Erlang load, 7 wavelengths, First-Fit). <p> Second, this model can be utilized as an evaluation metric for the heuristic placement of a sparse number of limited-range wavelength converters. This work will incorporate a formula from a model developed in <ref> [50] </ref>, which predicted the blocking probability for a single multihop path (up to seven hop paths were examined in [50]), in a network where each node is equipped with a full conversion switch but all wavelength converters have some fixed limited range. <p> This work will incorporate a formula from a model developed in <ref> [50] </ref>, which predicted the blocking probability for a single multihop path (up to seven hop paths were examined in [50]), in a network where each node is equipped with a full conversion switch but all wavelength converters have some fixed limited range. Unfortunately, the authors were unable to apply this model to to real networks with more complicated topologies. <p> Here, the main change to the model in Section 4.5.5 is incorporated. The blocking probability of segments cannot be treated independently 24 , so the entire source-destination path has to be treated as a whole. One method to solve this problem was developed in <ref> [50] </ref>, where the blocking probability of a path beginning on a particular wavelength was expressed recursively in terms of the probability that this particular wavelength was blocked and all wavelength paths that consisted of allowable wavelength conversions were also blocked. This method is briefly summarized in Appendix D.2. <p> If there was no overlap or complete overlap, then the segments can be treated independently. 25 The notation is intentionally kept similar to that in <ref> [50] </ref>, in order to highlight formulations utilized Chapter 4: Investigation of Sparse Wavelength Conversion 92 * There are fl total wavelengths numbered 1, 2, . . . fl. * The "range" of a wavelength converter is D, which is to say a wavelength can be converted up to D wavelengths up <p> Based on these definitions, P b (k; m; X) is defined as follows: P b (k; m; X) = p i=1 ! This can be solved based on a modified version of the formulation from <ref> [50] </ref>. <p> p fl used on segment j of R (k; m; X) [ a (fl);j+1 (k; m; X) fl1 " i;j (k; m; X) = (1 P wb;j (k; m; X) p @ i=1 ! 0 min (i+k;fl) " l;j+1 A A + fl1 " i;j (k; m; X) (4.9) from <ref> [50] </ref>. Chapter 4: Investigation of Sparse Wavelength Conversion 93 where P wb;j (k; m; X) is the probability of a single wavelength blocking in segment j of R (k; m; X). Now the formula for P wb;j (k; m; X) needs to be determined. <p> Since traffic is the same between all source destination pairs, this equates to averaging all the different source-destination path's blocking probabilities to compute the total network blocking probability. D.2 Model of Path Blocking Probabilities with Limited Range Wavelength Converters This section briefly summarizes the model in <ref> [50] </ref>, for blocking in networks with limited range wavelength converters. The model is meant to be applied to a source-destination path with arbitrary length, random wavelength assignment, and binomial traffic distribution, with being the probability of a given wavelength being busy on any hop.

Reference-contexts: This is due to the fact that the connection can just be transmitted on the appropriate "starting" wavelength. 4.3 Influence of Traffic Load on Wavelength Conversion It has been stated that the benefit of wavelength converters increases with increasing traffic <ref> [51] </ref>. Our study shows that this belief, with respect to blocking probabilities, is only true up to a certain load. Simulation results of the networks with and without wavelength conversion will now be presented. The simulation utilized the First-Fit wavelength assignment algorithm.

This network architectural summary has been compiled from two documents published by the AON consortium [23, 6], and the home page <ref> [52] </ref> of the AON consortium. Although the AON network is being developed with both WDM and TDM in mind, we will focus on the architectural aspects specific to WDM.
