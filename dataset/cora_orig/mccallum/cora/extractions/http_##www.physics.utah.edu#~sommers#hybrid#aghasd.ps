Abstract: Recent reports of superhigh energy cosmic rays beyond the expected spectral cutoff have intensified interest in the unknown origin of the highest energy cosmic rays. There is a need for a much larger data base of more precisely measured air showers. This requires new sensitive detectors of enormous aperture. Combining a ground array of particle counters with an optical detector of atmospheric fluorescence yields a detector of outstanding capability. Such a hybrid detector provides far more accurate measurements of energies, arrival directions, and primary particle atomic masses than can be achieved by either type of detector separately.

Reference-contexts: The higher energy particles recently reported seem to confirm the existence of a population of superhigh energy particles (above the expected GZK cutoff). The shape of the spectrum near 100 EeV is influenced by numerous factors <ref> [14] </ref>, and determining the spectrum in sufficient detail will require enormous detector exposures. The superhigh energy particles already detected suggest that new physics or new astrophysics will be learned in this endeavor.

Reference-contexts: The fact that anisotropy has not so far been established, however, means that a much larger exposure is required. J. Cronin has advocated building a 5000 km 2 detector in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres to gain good exposure to the entire sky <ref> [19] </ref>. Arrival directions are not the only clues to the origins of the highest energy particles. An advanced detector should strive to identify the types of primary particles which initiate the air showers it detects. <p> energy of the electromagnetic particle cascade. (If a distant shower is observed only near its maximum development, the size at maximum is itself a good estimator of the shower's energy.)

The total shower size at ground level is estimated from the ground stations by fitting the measured densities to a lateral distribution function.

Reference-contexts: the cross-calibration by shower densities at ground level can be done in more detail for showers landing near the eye. 2.2 Sensitivity to composition The Fly's Eye's method for extracting information about the cosmic ray chemical composition has exploited the distribution of shower depths-of-maximum (X max ) at various energies <ref> [21] </ref>. At any fixed energy, heavy nuclei are expected to produce showers which develop higher in the atmosphere than showers produced by protons or light nuclei. This is partly because heavy nuclei have larger interaction cross-sections, so their showers typically start at smaller grammage.

Reference-contexts: Other shower parameters measured by the detector may also have sensitivity to composition, for example the muon pulse rise time and the muon/electromagnetic ratio at large distance from the core. D. Nitz has explored the power of combining all such parameters in a multidimensional analysis of composition <ref> [22] </ref>. 6 2.3 Geometric reconstruction and angular resolution A detailed Monte Carlo of the entire hybrid detector should be used to evaluate the accuracy of air shower geometric reconstructions.

Reference-contexts: Analytic arguments provide an estimate of the expected accuracy of reconstruction without recourse to a full Monte Carlo. The following is one analytic approach. The HiRes (High Resolution Fly's Eye) prototype has demonstrated that an eye can determine a track-eye plane to an accuracy of approximately 0.1 ffi <ref> [23] </ref>. The track-eye plane is that plane which includes the location of the eye and the line of the shower axis. Experimentally, it is the plane through the eye which most nearly contains the pointing directions of phototubes centered on the shower axis.

With Flash ADC electronics, such monocular reconstruction may achieve excellent accuracy. However, that has not yet been demonstrated, and the Utah group has emphasized stereo reconstructions to achieve better resolution than has been obtained by this monocular method.

Reference-contexts: For a track seen by 10 pixels, the uncertainty in t should be less than 0.07 s. The uncertainty in t g depends on the distance of the ground station from the shower core approximately like <ref> [25] </ref> t = 0:0016 (1 + r=0:03) 1:6 s; (12) where r is the distance from the core in km.

Reference-contexts: Although detailed atmospheric monitoring is possible, such precise monitoring would add significant cost to the detector. 3.3 Alternative optical physiologies The first attempt at an atmospheric fluorescence cosmic ray detector used Fresnel lenses rather than mirrors. That was the "cosmic house" built by Greisen and graduate students at Cornell <ref> [28] </ref>. They failed to measure cosmic ray air showers. The atmospheric fluorescence technique was successfully implemented in the Utah Fly's Eye using mirrors to focus the light. Like the Fly's Eye, the HiRes detector also uses clusters of phototubes at the foci of mirrors.

Reference-contexts: Like the Fly's Eye, the HiRes detector also uses clusters of phototubes at the foci of mirrors. In principle, however, other light focusing methods can be used instead of mirrors. Nocturnal insects and crustaceans have evolved eyes <ref> [29] </ref> which may be more efficient than the compound fly's eye in collecting dim light signals. In those animals, there is a hemispheric surface which collects the light and focuses it onto an inner hemispheric retina.

Reference-contexts: The light focusing is achieved by 18 reflecting the tangential component of each light ray at the outer hemisphere while preserving its radial component. A "moth's eye" (nocturnal insect eye) can be made using lenses to reflect the tangential directions. J. Elbert studied in some detail <ref> [30] </ref> the feasibility of such a design, making the outer hemisphere from a mosaic of 3-layer Fresnel lenses. Numerical simulations showed the optical properties to be completely satisfactory for a fluorescence detector of cosmic ray air showers.

Reference-contexts: The phototubes were arranged on a hemisphere of approximately half that radius. A lobster eye uses reflecting tubes of square cross section, arranged on the outer hemisphere with the tube axes aligned radially <ref> [31] </ref>. Reflecting the tangential component of a light ray requires it to reflect off two adjacent walls. The light which reflects only off one wall forms two perpendicular lines of focus, their intersection coinciding with the focal point for the twice-reflected light.
