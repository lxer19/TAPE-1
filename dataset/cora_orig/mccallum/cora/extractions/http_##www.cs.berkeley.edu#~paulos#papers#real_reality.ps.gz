Title: Delivering Real Reality to the World Wide Web via Telerobotics  
Author: Eric Paulos John Canny 
Address: Berkeley  
Affiliation: Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science University of California,  
Abstract: Robots provide us with a means to move around in, visual ize, and interact with a remote physical world. We have ex ploited these physical properties coupled with the growing diversity of users on the World Wide Web (WWW) [ 1 ] to cre ate a WWW based telerobotic remote environment browser. This browser, called Mechanical Gaze, allows multiple re mote WWW users to control a robot arm with an attached camera to explore a real remote environment. The environ ment varies but is typically composed of collections of phys ical museum exhibits which WWW users can view at various positions, orientations, and levels of resolution. http://vive.cs.berkeley.edu/capek

Reference-contexts: These pages can be ac cessed by navigating the camera in physical space, and cen tering on a particular object. The pages can be thought of as mark-ups of 3D objects in the spirit of VRML <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> , but where the objects are actual physical entities in a remote space rather than simply models.

Reference-contexts: Rather than a fixed, static display, the browser must al low users true three-dimensional navigation around objects at varying positions, orientations, and levels of resolution. As David Gelernter suggests in his book Mirror Worlds <ref> [ 3 ] </ref> , such systems that gaze into remote spaces should show each visitor exactly what they want to see. This requires the sys tem to provide millions of different views from millions of different focuses on the same object.

Reference-contexts: The other code interacts directly with the remote WWW user by handling administrative issues, re source contention, HTML page layout, and requests to the robot daemon when the robot must be moved. 6.1 Radius: The Robot Control Daemon Radius, named after the main robot character in R.U.R by Karel Capek <ref> [ 23 ] </ref> , is the robot control daemon that provides a standardized interface to the various robots involved. By standardizing this interface, the rest of the system can be written ignoring any special kinematics or control systems for the particular end robot.
