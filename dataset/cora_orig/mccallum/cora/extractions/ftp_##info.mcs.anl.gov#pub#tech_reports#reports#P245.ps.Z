Reference-contexts: Since we are dealing with nonsmooth functions like f 1 , some stronger version of the Hopf near-boundary theorem has to be used.

We thus find that must be a ball, because it is connected. Then (3.10) gives the conclusions of Theorem 1. 4 Proof of Theorem 2 Gidas, Ni, and Nirenberg proved in <ref> [GNN] </ref> that the solutions of 8 &gt; : u &gt; 0 in B R (0); de3 (4:1) with f (s) = f 1 (s) + f 2 (s); f2 (4:2) where f 1 is Lipschitz continuous and f 2 nondecreasing, must be radially symmetric about 0 and, furthermore, @u @r &lt; <p> On the other hand, if a decomposition like (4.2) does not exist, in particular if f is not smooth, then it is an open problem whether positive solutions of (1.1) are radially symmetric. Actually, some examples given in <ref> [GNN, pp. 220] </ref> show that these cases could be very delicate. In this part, we will try to treat a family of nonlinear terms f which are neither Lip schitz nor nondecreasing.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Let be a smooth, bounded and connected domain in &lt; n . In this paper, we consider the following boundary value problem: 8 &gt; : u &gt; 0 in ; @n = 0 on @: Here, n denotes the unit outer normal to @. (See <ref> [KK] </ref> for existence and uniqueness results for (1.1).) We prove the following two theorems. Theorem 1 Let f be such that f (s) = f 1 (s) + f 2 (s); f (1:2) where f 1 is nondecreasing and f 2 Lipschitz continuous. <p> In this part, we will try to treat a family of nonlinear terms f which are neither Lip schitz nor nondecreasing. Such situations arise, for example, in the study of free-boundary problems for Emden-Fowler type equations (see <ref> [KK] </ref>), where f (u) = u 1=p u 1=q with 1 p &lt; q 1: f3 (4:3) Remark 1. If q = 1, then f (s) = s 1=p 1 is an increasing function in s and therefore [GNN]'s result implies that u must be radially symmetric.
