Abstract: Functionality-based recognition systems recognize objects at the category level by reasoning about how well the objects support the expected function. Such systems naturally associate a "measure of goodness" or "membership value" with a recognized object. This measure of goodness is the result of combining individual measures, or membership values, from potentially many primitive evaluations of different properties of the object's shape. A membership function is used to compute the membership value when evaluating a primitive of a particular physical property of an object. In previous versions of a recognition system known as Gruff, the membership function for each of the primitive evaluations was hand-crafted by the system designer. In this paper, we provide a learning component for the Gruff system, called Omlet, that automatically learns membership functions given a set of example objects labeled with their desired category measure. The learning algorithm is generally applicable to any problem in which low-level membership values are combined through an and-or tree structure to give a final overall membership value.

The accumulation of a complete 3-D shape model through a sequence of range images is a topic of current research.

Reference-contexts: increase in overall error are permitted for the next training epoch. 4.4 The Training Approach In order to learn all the various subcategories defined in a category definition tree, we utilize a machine learning approach which is based on an assumption about human learning known as one disjunct per lesson <ref> (Lehn, 1990) </ref>. Perhaps it is easiest to understand the mechanics of our learning approach if we explain the one-disjunct-per-lesson assumption in the terminology of cognitive science.

Reference-contexts: Considerable "tweaking" of the object description parameters may be required by a human expert in order to achieve satisfactory system performance. Machine learning techniques can be used to generate concepts that are consistent with observed examples. Some examples of such learning systems include C4.5 (Quinlan, 1992), and AQ <ref> (Michalski, 1983) </ref>. System performance is affected by the ratio of the number of training examples to the number of features used to describe the examples, and the accuracy with which the examples represent the "real-world" objects the CV system may encounter.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a separate measure of goodness is produced for each primitive evaluation. These measures are combined to produce a final aggregate measure of goodness for the object. The Gruff system <ref> (Stark & Bowyer, 1991) </ref> is a function-based object recognition system which utilizes fuzzy logic, in the manner just described, to evaluate 3-D shapes. <p> However, some modifications to the learning approaches would be needed as they normally work in domains without rule chaining or hierarchies of rules as there are in Gruff/Omlet. 3. The Gruff Object Recognition System The Gruff acronym stands for Generic Representation Using Form and Function <ref> (Stark & Bowyer, 1991) </ref>. The Gruff recognition system takes a 3-D shape description as input, reasons about whether the shape could belong to any of the object categories known to Gruff, and outputs an interpretation for each category to which the object could belong. <p> The average error per example versus the training set size is plotted for training sets of 10, 20, 30, ... , N-1 samples. The point with N-1 training examples represents the leave-one-out test results. 5.1 Test on the Gruff Chair Database From the evaluations of Gruff <ref> (Stark & Bowyer, 1991) </ref>, a large database of 3-D shapes specified as polyhedral boundary representations has been built up. Figure 9 shows 52 chair shapes. A number of the 52 shapes can belong to more than one category or can function in more than one stable orientation.

Reference-contexts: For example, in Figure 3, an object that belongs to the subcategory straightback chair also belongs to the categories conventional chair and chair. A superordinate category furniture could be added above the chair category <ref> (Stark & Bowyer, 1994) </ref>. 194 Learning Membership Functions in Object Recognition 3.3 Combination of Evidence The evaluation measures returned by the primitive invocations at a functional property node are combined using the T-norm: T (a; b) = a fi b where a and b are the measures being combined.

Reference-contexts: The particular T-norm/T-conorm pair utilized in this paper was chosen from among representative T-norm/T-conorm possibilities (including non-probabilistic formulations) described by Bonissone and Decker (1986) after analyzing their performance in conjunction with Gruff across a set of example shapes <ref> (Stark, Hall, & Bowyer, 1993a) </ref>. 4. The OMLET Learning System In this section, we describe the Omlet learning (sub)system. Omlet learns fuzzy membership functions, which are located at the leaves of an And/Or categorization tree, from sets 196 Learning Membership Functions in Object Recognition of training examples.

Reference-contexts: A version of Gruff has been developed which attempts to recognize object functionality from the shape model that is extracted from a single range image <ref> (Stark, Hoover, Goldgof, & Bowyer, 1993b) </ref>. A major difficulty here is, of course, that a single range image does not yield a complete model of the 3-D shape of an object. The "back half" of the object shape is unseen (Hoover, Goldgof, & Bowyer, 1995).
