Abstract: In this paper, we use a permanent decomposition identity to introduce more parameters. We show that a class of random parameter settings reduces the expected number of nonzero-valued terms to an exponentially small fraction of the terms. We present an algorithm that achieves (exp[ n 4 log 2 n

Reference-contexts: Ryser devised an inclusion and exclusion formula for the permanent. Evaluating the formula requires O (2 n poly n) time and O (poly n) space. The finite-difference formula for the permanent is a generalization of the inclusion and exclusion formula <ref> [1] </ref>. The finite-difference formula has some free parameters which can be chosen to produce permanent formulas that have many zero-valued terms. These terms can be collected to reduce computation [3]. In this paper, we review the finite-difference formula. <p> 1 v 1 ) (u n v n ) x2fu 1 ;v 1 gfi:::fifu n ;v n g (1) s (x) P (x) (10) where s (x) is the number of variables x j set to v j . (For a more detailed deriva tion of this formula, refer to <ref> [1] </ref>.) 5 3 Zero-Valued Terms Consider the center expression in (8). Note that P (x) has value zero when any row sum of A (x) is zero, because P (x) is the product of row sums. If P (x) is zero, then the corresponding term of (10) is zero. <p> Also, approximate the row sum by a normal distribution with mean (2k n)p and variance npq. (For detailed justification and analysis of these approximations, see <ref> [1] </ref>.) With these approximations, the expected fraction of nonzero-valued terms is ~ k=0 p g ( p )[1 p g ( p )] n (15) 6 n and 4t = 2 p n . Approximate the sum by an integral. <p> Approximate the sum by an integral. The previous expression is ~ dt g (t)[1 p g ( p t)] n (16) In <ref> [1] </ref>, it is shown that this expression is O ((n q 2 ). <p> Note that the bracketed expression is in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for all k. So the term corresponding to k is no greater than 1 2 n k , which is the probability that the sum of n i.i.d. <p> Bernoulli variables: (d 1 + : : : + d m + a 1 + : : : + a k ) (d m+1 + : : : + d 2m + a k+1 + : : : + a n ) (33) In <ref> [1] </ref>, it is shown that the distribution of this difference can be asymptotically approximated by a Gaussian with the same mean and variance as the difference: Prf (d 1 +: : :+d m )(d m+1 +: : :+d 2m )+(a 1 +: : :+a k )(a k+1 +: : :+a n <p> So the asymptotic form of the expected fraction of nonzero-valued terms is jt k j4n 0:14 r c pt c 11 In <ref> [1] </ref>, it is shown that this sum has the same asymptotic form as the following integral.

Then we have the following bound for the asymptotic expected fraction of nonzero valued terms: r r Z 1 w r1 (log w 2 e w dw (42) This integral has asymptotic form <ref> [1] </ref>: r r 1 n r log n So the asymptotic expected fraction of nonzero-valued terms is O ( q c ) (44) For n ! 1 and c constant with respect to n, increasing row sum variance cn through decomposition decreases the expected fraction of nonzero-valued terms. 4.3 Variance Increased <p> Recall that the expected value of a row sum in a 0-1 matrix, given k variables x j assigned +1, is: k = (2k n)p (99) where p is the probability of each entry taking value 1. Since the computational reduction proof applies for p 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, it applies for j k j as large as j2k nj. For f1; 0; 1g matrices, let 0 be the expected value of each entry. <p> Finite-difference algorithms have been developed for several other problems than the matrix permanent, including counting paths and cycles [2], sequencing, bin-packing, and deadlock avoidance <ref> [1] </ref>. One opportunity for future research is to find finite-difference parameters and procedures (like decomposition for the matrix permanent problem) that allow significant reductions in the time required to evaluate the finite-difference formulas for these problems. 23

Strategies to reduce computation in an algorithm with polynomial space requirements by collecting sets of zero-valued terms are discussed in <ref> [3] </ref>. The strategies are heuristic, and they are designed for general finite-difference formulas. It should be possible to design better strategies for matrices with decomposition.
