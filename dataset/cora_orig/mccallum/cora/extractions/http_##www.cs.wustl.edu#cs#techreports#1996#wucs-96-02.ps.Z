Abstract: We present the design and implementation of Sensus, a practical, secure and private system for conducting surveys and elections over computer networks. Expanding on the work of Fujioka, Okamoto, and Ohta, Sensus uses blind signatures to ensure that only registered voters can vote and that each registered voter only votes once, while at the same time maintaining voters' privacy. Sensus allows voters to verify independently that their votes were counted correctly, and anonymously challenge the results should their votes be miscounted. We outline seven desirable properties of voting systems and show that Sensus satisfies these properties well, in some cases better than traditional voting systems.

Reference-contexts: Our design goals are based on our survey of the literature on traditional and proposed electronic polling systems. We reviewed several sets of ideal election system characteristics found in the literature <ref> [1, 10, 15, 18, 20] </ref> and developed a set of four core properties that are likely to be desirable in almost any election system: Accuracy. <p> Sensus Polling Protocol Sensus has been designed as an easily adaptable modular system. The polling protocol requires the existence of validator, tallier, and pollster modules. Additional modules may augment the Sensus system. 4 Benaloh and Tuinstra <ref> [1] </ref> explain: There are reports that in some small Italian villages, the voting system employed allows voters to list their votes in any order. Political bosses are said to assign different permutations of their preferred candidates to each voter. <p> In addition, because of the scheme's large communication complexity, casting a vote may take an unacceptably long time [17]. In 1994 Benaloh and Tuinstra proposed a set of verifiable secret-ballot election protocols that do not allow voters to prove the contents of their votes <ref> [1] </ref>. Unlike the other cryptographic protocols discussed here, these protocols require voters to vote inside a voting booth. The authors maintain that the simplest of their protocols does not require computations on the part of the voter that are outside the range of normal human ability.

Reference-contexts: Cryptographic Polling Protocols Chaum proposed the first published cryptographic voting protocol in a 1981 paper on anonymous electronic mail and digital pseudonyms <ref> [3] </ref>. This protocol uses public key cryptography and relies on rosters of digital pseudonyms to conceal the identity of voters. However, the protocol does not guarantee that the identity of voters cannot be traced. Chaum later proposed a protocol which unconditionally conceals the identity of voters [5].

Reference-contexts: The registrar must take a list of people eligible to register (population list) and a list of people who have 5 The Sensus polling protocol uses blind signatures to preserve privacy and democracy simultaneously. First introduced by Chaum <ref> [4] </ref>, blind signatures allow a document to be signed without revealing its contents. The effect is similar to placing a document and a sheet of carbon paper inside an envelope. If somebody signs the outside of the envelope, they also sign the document on the inside of the envelope.

Reference-contexts: Sensus was designed primarily as a replacement for postal mail balloting systems; however, it is flexible enough to suit a variety of other polling applications, including those not feasible using traditional polling systems <ref> [8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Although not a practical solution for Internet voting, the receipt-free nature of this system is significant because it prevents voters from participating in vote buying schemes. A number of other cryptographic voting schemes have been proposed that require interactions between voters. These schemes, including <ref> [9] </ref>, may be useful in a board room setting, but are not suitable for most large-scale elections. The more practical cryptographic schemes do not require any interaction between voters or use of specialized equipment. However, none of these schemes prevent vote buying.

Reference-contexts: In addition, electronic surveys and elections can be inexpensive to administer. However, if not carefully designed, electronic polling systems can be easily compromised, thus corrupting results or violating voters' privacy. Following the work of Fujioka, Okamoto, and Ohta <ref> [10] </ref>, we have designed a security-conscious electronic polling system called Sensus that can be used to conduct surveys and elections over the Internet. <p> Our design goals are based on our survey of the literature on traditional and proposed electronic polling systems. We reviewed several sets of ideal election system characteristics found in the literature <ref> [1, 10, 15, 18, 20] </ref> and developed a set of four core properties that are likely to be desirable in almost any election system: Accuracy. <p> The pollster acts as a voter's agent, performing all cryptographic and data transfer functions on a voter's behalf. The Sensus protocol is based closely on a scheme proposed by Fujioka, Okamoto, and Ohta <ref> [10] </ref> that uses blind signatures 5 to provide security while protecting voters' privacy. The Sensus protocol requires the voter to prepare a voted ballot, encrypt it with a secret key, and blind it. The voter then signs the ballot and sends it to the validator. <p> Ten years later, Fujioka, Okamoto, and Ohta developed a practical voting scheme that uses blind signatures to solve the collusion problem inherent in protocols like the Two Agency Protocol without significantly increasing the overall complexity of the protocol <ref> [10] </ref>. (A number of other, less satisfactory blind signature protocols have also been proposed.

Reference-contexts: However, when used for local elections these systems are more likely to be abused because a relatively small number of precincts contribute to the final vote tally.

Large professional, social, and special interest organizations tend to hold their elections through mail-in balloting. These systems allow voters to cast their votes from virtually any location, however, they often sacrifice accuracy and privacy.

In both cases the courts refused to strike down laws allowing mail-in balloting, despite the Kansas court acknowledging that vote by mail increases the potential for compromise of secrecy and opportunity for fraud <ref> [13] </ref>. Most traditional election systems can be verified only by party representatives or trusted third parties. It is generally not possible for voters to verify that individual votes were counted correctly.

Reference-contexts: Sako, for example, proposed a protocol that is simpler but does not completely prevent election administrators from linking ballots with the voters who cast them <ref> [16] </ref>.) The Sensus protocol is based closely on the Fujioka, Okamoto, and Ohta scheme. The main difference between these schemes emerges after the voter has submitted the encrypted ballot to the tallier. In the Sensus protocol, the tallier responds by sending a receipt to the voter.
