Abstract: This paper describes the various artistic effects of watercolor and shows how they can be simulated automatically. Our watercolor model is based on an ordered set of translucent glazes, which are created independently using a shallow-water fluid simulation. We use a Kubelka-Munk compositing model for simulating the optical effect of the superimposed glazes. We demonstrate how computer-generated watercolor can be used in three different applications: as part of an interactive watercolor paint system, as a method for automatic image watercolorization, and as a mechanism for non-photorealistic rendering of three-dimensional scenes.

Reference-contexts: This phenomenon occurs in any evaporating suspension in which the contact line of a drop is pinned in place by surface tension <ref> [3] </ref>. Because of this geometric constraint, liquid evaporating near the boundary must be replenished by liquid from the interior, resulting in outward flow. This flow carries pigment with it, leading to edge darkening as the water evaporates.

Reference-contexts: Glazing is different from ordinary painting in that the different pigments are not mixed physically, but opticallyin their superposition on the paper. Glazes yield a pleasing effect that is often described as luminous, or as glowing from within <ref> [4, 32] </ref>. We suspect that this subjective impression arises from the edge-darkening effect.

In our use of the KM model, each pigment is assigned a set of absorption coefficients K and scattering coefficients S. These coefficients are a function of wavelength, and control the fraction of energy absorbed and scattered back, respectively, per unit distance in the layer of pigment.

Reference-contexts: Such paints have high scattering in the same wavelengths as their color, and low absorption in all wavelengths. Such pigments actually get their color from interference effects involving the phase of light waves, which have been modeled accurately by Gondek et al. <ref> [11] </ref>. While our simple model does not simulate phase effects, it nevertheless manages to produce colors similar in appearance to the interference paints used in watercolor painting.

We have found this method of specifying pigments to be quite adequate for creating a wide range of realistic paints (see Figure 5). In addition, the method is much easier than taking the kind of extremely careful measurements that would otherwise be required.

Reference-contexts: In our tests, we generated these regions quickly using a commercial paint program. We have also chosen the pigments by hand in our examples, although for further automation, the choice of pigments could instead be computed through an optimization process <ref> [31] </ref>. <p> An algorithm to automatically specify wet areas so that hard edges are placed properly would be especially useful, as well as a color-separation algorithm to calculate the optimal palette of pigments to use for various regions of the image <ref> [31] </ref>. Other possibilities include automatic recognition and generation of textures using drybrush, spattering, scraping, and other techniques. Generalization. Our model treats backruns and wet-in-wet flow patterns as two separate processes.

Reference-contexts: Glazing is different from ordinary painting in that the different pigments are not mixed physically, but opticallyin their superposition on the paper. Glazes yield a pleasing effect that is often described as luminous, or as glowing from within <ref> [4, 32] </ref>. We suspect that this subjective impression arises from the edge-darkening effect.

Reference-contexts: M. W. Turner (17751851), John Constable (17761837), and David Cox (17831859) began to experiment with new techniques such as wiping and scratching out, and with the immediacy and spontaneity of the medium <ref> [35] </ref>. To simulate watercolor effectively, it is important to study not only the physical properties of the medium, but also the characteristic phenomena that make watercolor so popular to artists. A simulation is successful only if it can achieve many of the same effects. <p> Watercolor paint (also called, simply, watercolor) is a suspension of pigment particles in a solution of water, binder, and surfactant <ref> [17, 25, 35] </ref>. The ingredients of watercolor are described in more detail below. Watercolor paper is typically not made from wood pulp, but instead from linen or cotton rags pounded into small fibers. The paper itself is mostly air, laced with a microscopic web of these tangled fibers.

We would like to explore further the idea of automatic watercolorization of images in a more general sense.

Reference-contexts: We use a much simpler model in our system. Paper texture is modeled as a height field and a fluid capacity field. The height field h is generated using one of a selection of pseudo-random processes <ref> [29, 41] </ref>, and scaled so that 0 &lt; h &lt; 1.
