Reference-contexts: Electrodes on the back of the screen can be used to display information by polarizing light in different parts of the display. In 1990 Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry sponsored a $100-million project to develop a 40-inch flat-panel display by 1996 <ref> [1] </ref>. In 1990 and 1991 alone, Sharp, Sanyo, Matsushita, Hitachi, Hoshiden, Toshiba-IBM, Mitsubishi, and NEC together committed almost $2.25 billion to develop active-matrix liquid-crystal displays [11]. Worldwide annual sales of flat screens now exceed $2 billion [18].

Reference-contexts: Education and flexibility are essential when what you sell, how you sell it, who you sell it to, and what they want, are all changing. Classical economic theory is largely irrelevant to the early stages of a new information industry <ref> [2] </ref>. Economics assumes that resources are finite and that there is sufficient time for markets to reach stability.

Reference-contexts: Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the largest company in the world, has already built an experimental fiber system transmitting almost 1/3 gigabytes a second over 2,200 kilometers <ref> [3] </ref>. In 1989, LAN sales (hardware, software, and cabling) exceeded $5.68 billion in the U.S. alone [43]. In September the U.S. Senate approved a $1 billion expenditure over the next 5 years to develop high-speed supercomputing networks linking Federal, university, and corporate research centers.

Reference-contexts: Notebooks are 3-ring notebook-sized (21 centimeters by 30 centimeters and 5 centimeters thick) or smaller. Today they weigh between 2.5 and 4 kilograms, but that is dropping rapidly <ref> [4] </ref>. The new pen-based notebooks are about 2.5 kilograms. They are about the size of a thick magazine and dispense with a keyboard by reading the user's handwriting. In this, the second year of pen-based computers, there are already 33 companies producing pen-based computers.

Reference-contexts: By 2000 the U.S. Geological Survey expects to complete its national digital cartographic database. This database will include all the information on the agency's maps, and the agency is working with the U.S. Census Bureau to integrate demographic data <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: As the technology has improved, receivers have shrunk; currently receivers can be less than 1 meter wide (an arm's length) and are expected to shrink further. These receivers are affordable by individuals and are growing ever cheaper. There are now 1,400 satellites of all types in orbit <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: But if publishers try either copy protection or high prices, or worse, copy protection to enforce high prices, a breed of intellectual terrorists may arise, who will break their copy protection and anonymously distribute unprotected copies for free along the electronic networks (for example, see the NuPrometheus league discussed in <ref> [8] </ref>). And millions of people are reachable electronically. Of course, such a market also encourages pirates.

Reference-contexts: But industry has to look at more issues. Just because a new technology is technically superior to an older technology does not mean that it will win; it can lose for social reasons that have nothing to do with technology <ref> [9] </ref>. For example, digital audio tape has not yet replaced analog tape in the U.S. thanks to strenuous obstruction from the Recording Industry Association of America. Although automated teller machines were a success for Citibank, Chemical Bank lost tens of millions on their experimental home banking system [21].

Reference-contexts: For example, the Canon PC-311 costs $400. And this is not an industry that is about to disappear; worldwide, the copying industry now sells $14 billion worth of equipment, of which Canon alone accounts for $3.5 billion <ref> [10] </ref>. Worse, copiers are going to get smaller and cheaper. The cost of electronic storage has dropped so low relative to printing costs, that a copier can be merely a scanner with a capacious memory. Such a copier could be palm-sized|it would be attachable to a separate computer or printer.

Reference-contexts: Only with constant title turnover will they keep their readership. Publishers should also renegotiate their author contracts to allow for electronic distribution. Putnam and Berkley have already adapted their contracts to keep electronic display rights <ref> [12] </ref>. Through ignorance of the market and the technology Random House sold the electronic display rights for its dictionary and other references for a mere $10,000 plus 10 percent of the royalties [52]. Random House expected to make $40,000 (this was the lower cap in the contract).

Reference-contexts: For publishers this means that sales could be higher. Many believe that the U.S. is facing serious education problems. Every year 700,000 high-school students drop out, while another 700,000 graduate unable to read; the percentage of graduating high-school students has dropped every year since 1984 <ref> [13] </ref>. The social problems causing the drop out are serious and severe and most are unrelated to books, so electronic books are no cure-all, but they may help reverse the trend. Eventually all books will become animated, vocal, and interactive.

Reference-contexts: This network will be 100 times faster than current high-speed networks. In 10 years, networks that are citywide (metropolitan-area networks, or MANs) and nationwide (wide-area networks, or WANs) with bandwidths of 1/8 to 1/4 gigabytes will be the standard <ref> [14] </ref>. These bandwidths let us send a 500-page book in under 4 milliseconds.

Reference-contexts: By 1982, it had more than doubled its market share, and its share continued to rise by about 1 percent a year since 1983. By 1990, its share of the retail market was 14.7 percent|triple its 1977 share <ref> [15] </ref>. In 1983, eight other banks banded together to meet the threat and formed NYCE (New York Cash Exchange). By 1988, NYCE was the second largest shared ATM network in the world, trailing only France's Carte Bleue.

Reference-contexts: They are low power and they will make disc drives obsolete within 7 years. At present they are expensive, but the price is expected to drop rapidly as technology improves and demand drives their development <ref> [17] </ref>. Fujitsu, the second largest computer company in the world, and Intel are presently working on a 64-megabyte memory card.

Reference-contexts: Currently every developed nation is laying millions of kilometers of fiberoptic cable a year. Hong Kong's telephone network will be all digital by 1994, Singapore's by 1995, and Japan's by 1996. A.2.5 Electronic Networks Today's fiberoptic local-area networks (LANs) have bandwidths of 6.25 to 18.75 megabytes per second <ref> [19] </ref>, which lets us send a 500-page book in under 1/6 of a second. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the largest company in the world, has already built an experimental fiber system transmitting almost 1/3 gigabytes a second over 2,200 kilometers [3].

Videocassette recorders succeeded over analog videodisc players because videocassettes were rewriteable and the videodisc industry paid no attention to the renting market. Fax machines are more prevalent than electronic mail in the business community because they require no special protocols and business people are more familiar with paper.

GTE spent 6 weeks and $14,000 to create an Apple HyperCard system that let executives keep informed about their own business <ref> [22] </ref>. Hypertext lets users chart their own course through the data; text versus hypertext is like taking a train versus driving a car. Soon after GTE adopted the system its president demanded all his reports this way instead of formal presentations from middle management.

Alan Kay in <ref> [28] </ref> To understand the long-term threat to publishing paper books we need to understand some technology: computer memory, optical discs, memory cards, geosynchronous satellites, cellular radio, radio frequency modems, fiberop-tic cable, electronic networks, flat-panel displays, portable computers, and desktop computers. <p> The long-term threat to paper publishing comes from dynabooks. In 1971, Alan Kay at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) had an idea for a computational notebook that he called a dynabook <ref> [28] </ref>. For the purposes of this report, a dynabook is a notebook-sized keyboardless portable computer, with a large high-resolution touch-sensitive color display and an electronic pen. It communicates with the world through radio.

The U.S. now has about 6,500 independent bookstores and the top 3 chains own about 2,750 outlets. More publishers would increase title diversity and the market would decide what is good and what is not|as is true on the electronic network, but not in print.

Reference-contexts: Personal computers are not yet as common as dishwashers, but that is only a few years away. It is hard to grasp just how much computers have improved. Unlike any other technology ever, computers have improved 10 millionfold in the past 50 years <ref> [36] </ref>; in that time computers have gone from the lab to the lap. In terms of size alone, in 40 years computers shrank from large rooms, to cars, to refrigerators, to ovens, to microwave ovens, to record players, to large books, to magazines.

Reference-contexts: After buying a disc, a reader who wants a particular title phones the publisher and the publisher gives the title's decrypt key and charges the reader's credit card. Such a scheme is already being tried by font and clip-art companies <ref> [38] </ref>. Of course, once one reader is given the decrypt key for a particular title that reader could tell the rest of the world. So publishers may divide the print run into lots of 100, number the discs, and change all encrypt keys from one run to the next.

(Software publishers eventually broke this cycle by dispensing with copy protection and turning to a form of subscription publishing; successful publishers hooked their audience with a promise of continuous updates for a fee.) Instead of employing authors, the book publishing model is to encourage free-lance authors to write books, then

Reference-contexts: Cross-referencing can be either reader controlled or computer generated. And all the advantages of paper books|handwritten annotation, highlighting with colored markers, underlining, post-it notes, bookmarks|can be allowed through software on small portable pen-based computers (for example, see <ref> [40] </ref>). Also, books can be customizable by, or for, their readers; a copy of a book need no longer be an exact copy|as has already happened in consumer-targeted advertising.

Reference-contexts: Fax machines are more prevalent than electronic mail in the business community because they require no special protocols and business people are more familiar with paper. And most telling of all for this report, after 15 years most videotext systems have yet to take off <ref> [41] </ref>. On the other hand, matches replaced flint, cars replaced horses, telegraphs replaced the pony express, transistors replaced vacuum tubes, digital optical discs replaced analog phonograph discs, fiberoptic cable is replacing copper cable, and cable television is replacing airwave television.

Reference-contexts: Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the largest company in the world, has already built an experimental fiber system transmitting almost 1/3 gigabytes a second over 2,200 kilometers [3]. In 1989, LAN sales (hardware, software, and cabling) exceeded $5.68 billion in the U.S. alone <ref> [43] </ref>. In September the U.S. Senate approved a $1 billion expenditure over the next 5 years to develop high-speed supercomputing networks linking Federal, university, and corporate research centers. This network will be 100 times faster than current high-speed networks.

But making the Bookman's memory rewriteable (so that users can change it) and connecting it to a computer should take under a year. If Sony does not do it someone else will.

Reference-contexts: A APPENDIX: ELECTRONIC BOOK TECHNOLOGY 52 A.3 Flat-Panel Displays Unlike the cathode-ray tubes (CRTs) used as the display devices of most computers and televisions, a flat-panel display is flat, light, thin, and uses little power. They are rapidly replacing CRTs <ref> [47] </ref>. A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is one particular kind of flat-panel display; it is a sandwich of glass containing crystals of amorphous silicon or other materials that change the way they polarize light in response to electricity.

Reference-contexts: At 3,500 new books a month and climbing, major book chains and convenience outlets (convenience stores, drugstores, supermarkets) now keep new fiction less than 6 weeks. Soon paperback fiction will be monthly|the equivalent of one-shot magazines; eventually turnover will be weekly. To pervert To*er's prediction in Future Shock <ref> [48] </ref>, in a decade we will be living in a world of future schlock; 1,000 new books a day is possible, that is only a factor of 8 from today.

In the past decade the bandwidth of fiberoptic cable has increased 100 times while the cost of fiber fell from $3 a meter to 15 cents a meter <ref> [51] </ref>. Currently every developed nation is laying millions of kilometers of fiberoptic cable a year. Hong Kong's telephone network will be all digital by 1994, Singapore's by 1995, and Japan's by 1996.

If these prices are too high for one publisher or retailer a consortium of publishers can buy (or lease) the printers with each retailer. These on-demand retailers will save on most of the costs of contemporary retailers, so publishers may be justified in charging high licensing fees.
