Abstract: We present an approach for recovering surface shape from the occluding contour using an active (i.e., moving) observer. It is based on a relation between the geometries of a surface in a scene and its occluding contour: If the viewing direction of the observer is along a principal direction for a surface point whose projection is on the contour, surface shape (i.e., curvature) at the surface point can be recovered from the contour. Unlike previous approaches for recovering shape from the occluding contour, we use an observer that purposefully changes viewpoint in order to achieve a well-defined geometric relationship with respect to a 3D shape prior to its recognition. We show that there is a simple and efficient viewing strategy that allows the observer to align the viewing direction with one of the two principal directions for a point on the surface. This strategy depends on only curvature measurements on the occluding contour and therefore demonstrates that recovering quantitative shape information from the contour does not require knowledge of the velocities or accelerations of the observer. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be easily implemented and can provide reliable shape information from the occluding contour.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction There has been considerable interest in recovering information about the structure of a scene from sequences of images, assuming an observer in motion (e.g., work on optical flow <ref> [1] </ref> and shape- from-motion [2]). One common feature of these approaches is the use of known viewer motion in order to recover quantitative properties of the scene such as surface curvature [3].

Reference-contexts: One common feature of these approaches is the use of known viewer motion in order to recover quantitative properties of the scene such as surface curvature <ref> [3] </ref>. Recently, however, there has been considerable interest in employing simple observer behaviors that either make the recovery of scene properties easier and more efficient [4-9], or combine simple behaviors in order to perform complex tasks such as tracking, navigation, and obstacle avoidance [10-16]. <p> On the other hand, approaches that derive quantitative shape descriptions from the occluding contour assume that additional information is available in order to adequately constrain the shape recovery process <ref> [3, 21] </ref>. Such approaches require other means for deriving the additional shape information. For example, Cipolla and Blake [3] used a moving observer to change viewpoint and measured the relative accelerations of image features near the occluding contour in order to measure surface curvature. <p> On the other hand, approaches that derive quantitative shape descriptions from the occluding contour assume that additional information is available in order to adequately constrain the shape recovery process [3, 21]. Such approaches require other means for deriving the additional shape information. For example, Cipolla and Blake <ref> [3] </ref> used a moving observer to change viewpoint and measured the relative accelerations of image features near the occluding contour in order to measure surface curvature. <p> The issue here is how to accurately measure such changes in the contour's geometry with small viewpoint changes. For example, we must be able to measure the velocity and acceleration of surface points entering and leaving the rim <ref> [3, 29] </ref>, a problem that requires first- and second-order differentiation operations, and hence is sensitive to noise. The basic assumption used by all of the above approaches was that the viewing direction is arbitrary. <p> In fact k n and k o determine the second fundamental form at p. This was the main idea behind the surface reconstruction approach of Cipolla and Blake <ref> [3] </ref>. 1 This quantity is also referred to as the radial curvature of S at p. 11 The above results are important but they also imply that if we have no additional information about the shape of the viewed surface, the information provided by the occluding contour is primarily qualitative. <p> As in our simulations, this object motion allows the observer's viewing direction to be aligned only with the principal directions of points on the object whose tangent planes are horizontal. The occluding contour of the object was tracked across frames using a simplified implementation of a B-spline snake <ref> [3] </ref>. The snake was interactively initialized near the object's contour. Point tracking was again performed by tracking the point on the snake whose tangent is horizontal (Figure 15). <p> The reason is that if the surfaces are locally flat, surface points will enter and leave the rim at arbitrarily large rates. This problem will also exist for methods that measure image velocities in the vicinity of the rim (e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>), since they require that the image points or features are not widely separated on the surface. * Eq. (8) can also be used as a means to approximate k g 2 : After a small rotation by in the plane of N (p) and ~, the shape recovery step will

Reference-contexts: These approaches rely on maintaining specific geometric relationships between the observer and the environment. However, without knowledge of viewer motions they only recover qualitative information about the viewed scene (e.g., relative depth ordering with respect to the fixated scene point <ref> [17] </ref>). This paper presents a new approach that combines the above two paradigms in order to recover surface curvature from the occluding contour. We show that shape for a selected point on the viewed surface can be recovered from the occluding contour of two views.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, only a one-dimensional set of surface points project to the occluding contour. If the only information available is the occluding contour of the surface from a particular viewpoint, we can at best derive only a qualitative description of the entire surface. For example, Barrow and Tenenbaum <ref> [20] </ref> attempted to constrain the recovery problem using additional smoothness assumptions about the surface, but these assumptions do not hold in general. 2 The dependency of the occluding contour on viewpoint has been used to resolve both of the above ambiguities. <p> This is because, by definition, T p (S) contains both ~ and the tangent to the occluding contour <ref> [20] </ref>. * Let k o be the curvature of the occluding contour at q.

It has been shown that if we know how the geometry of the occluding contour changes with viewpoint, we can derive a parameterization of the surface and determine its shape <ref> [21] </ref>. Furthermore, algorithms for tracking such contours over a sequence of images are becoming increasingly more sophisticated [28].

Reference-contexts: This means that the viewing direction is not related in any way to the geometry of the rim or the occluding contour. (For example, there are surfaces for which their rim is planar when viewed from a particular set of directions <ref> [23] </ref>.) This is a reasonable approach, however, only if the observer cannot control the direction of gaze. When the observer has the ability to control the viewing direction, the choice of viewpoint (s) does not have to be arbitrary. <p> This means that the viewing direction is not related in any way to the geometry of the rim or the occluding contour. For example, there are surfaces for which their rim is planar when viewed from a particular set of directions <ref> [23] </ref>. The assumption that the direction of gaze is arbitrary immediately excludes such viewpoints from consideration since the rim is not always planar [33]. This is a reasonable assumption, however, only if the observer cannot control the direction of gaze. <p> However, there are surfaces for which the local shape of a single rim point reveals global properties of the surface. Surfaces of revolution present an ideal example of such surfaces. The properties and appearance of surfaces of revolution and their generalizations have been studied extensively <ref> [23, 24, 32, 34-38] </ref>. Here, we focus on the specific relation between their global structure and the local shape of points on the rim. Surfaces of revolution are formed by rotating a planar curve around a straight axis that does not meet the curve. <p> Therefore, we can completely describe a surface of revolution by the axis and the generating curve. Approaches for recovering the axis of a surface of revolution have been mainly geared towards detecting symmetries in their occluding contour or outline <ref> [23] </ref>, or utilizing their viewpoint-invariant properties [36, 37, 39]. The problem with detecting symmetries in the occluding contour is that the existence of such symmetries depends on viewpoint. On the other hand, the identification, detection and utilization of viewpoint-invariant properties is a non-trivial task.

The major problem, though, is that the occluding contour is created through a projection process and, in general, the information it provides is ambiguous, i.e., several different surface rims can project to the same occluding contour.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we can completely describe a surface of revolution by the axis and the generating curve. Approaches for recovering the axis of a surface of revolution have been mainly geared towards detecting symmetries in their occluding contour or outline [23], or utilizing their viewpoint-invariant properties <ref> [36, 37, 39] </ref>. The problem with detecting symmetries in the occluding contour is that the existence of such symmetries depends on viewpoint. On the other hand, the identification, detection and utilization of viewpoint-invariant properties is a non-trivial task. <p> The occluding contour from such a side view is symmetric. Therefore, the axis of rotation (as well as the generating curve) can be recovered by simply using existing symmetry-seeking approaches (e.g., <ref> [36] </ref>) which are well-defined for such a viewpoint. However, the direction and position of the axis can also be constrained by recovering the principal curvatures corresponding to the parallels for two points on the rim of a side view (Figure 9 (b)).

Reference-contexts: However, the direction and position of the axis can also be constrained by recovering the principal curvatures corresponding to the parallels for two points on the rim of a side view (Figure 9 (b)). This approach is similar to one used by Richetin et al. <ref> [38] </ref> where the geometry of the occluding contour at two parabolic points was used to hypothesize the pose for surfaces that are straight homogeneous generalized cylinders. The observer must choose between moving towards the principal direction of minimum curvature or moving towards the one of maximum curvature.

Reference-contexts: Curvature computations were performed by first approximating the occluding contour in the neighborhood of the selected points using cubic B-splines <ref> [40] </ref>. The curvature was measured at the points where the tangent to the splines was horizontal. Even though splines have the effect of smoothing high curvature parts of a curve, we found that even with the actual rim curvatures being underestimated the curvature maxima were very distinct.

Reference-contexts: viewing direction between frames can be accurately measured, the principal curvatures and principal directions at the selected point can be predicted using three viewing directions on the tangent plane of the tracked point that satisfy the reliability requirement of Section 6 (i.e., they are not too close to each other) <ref> [41] </ref>. This observation leads to a prediction-verification scheme for improving the accuracy of our active approach, whereby predictions during the process of aligning with a principal direction are evaluated against the outputs of the contour curvature estimator and the extremum detector.

Reference-contexts: Consider, for example, the problem of obtaining a "face-on" view of a planar curve (or a texture element). This problem has been studied extensively in the past and several approaches exist that hypothesize face-on views, based on information from a single viewpoint (e.g., <ref> [42, 43] </ref>). We are currently investigating an approach similar to the one presented in this paper that enables the observer to change viewpoint in order to obtain a face-on view of a planar curve.
