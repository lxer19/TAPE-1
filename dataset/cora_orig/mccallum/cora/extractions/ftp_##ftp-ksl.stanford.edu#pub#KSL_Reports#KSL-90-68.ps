Reference-contexts: Note that P (d i + | F) does not assume that only d i is present, but rather allows for multiple diseases to be present in the patient. Calculation of P (d i + | F) using the QMR-DT two-level belief network is an NP-hard problem, however <ref> [1] </ref>. We implemented an algorithm that uses Bayes' rule under the added assumption that diseases are mutually exclusive.

Reference-contexts: cases used in the experiment, techniques used to compare the performance of QMR and S, and sensitivity analyses testing various components of the model and the simulation algorithm. 2.1 Test Cases To evaluate QMR and S, we used cases abstracted from the Scientific American Medicine (SAM) Continuing Medical Education service <ref> [2] </ref>. The SAM cases provide physicians with a means of reviewing current clinical practice and of keeping abreast of new developments in internal medicine. Cases are created following specific guidelines by an expert in the subspecialty area containing the diagnosis in the case.

Reference-contexts: For instance, to denote an abnormal level of serum cholesterol, we may choose from either of the two binary findings: CHOLESTEROL BLOOD INCREASED or CHOLESTEROL BLOOD DECREASED. But to specify that the cholesterol value is normal, we must specify that both of the abnormal cholesterol findings are negative <ref> [3] </ref>. Next, consider findings corresponding to continuous variables for which there exist three or more INTERNIST-1/QMR descriptors.
Reference: 4. <author> Miller RA. </author> <type> Personal communication, </type> <year> 1990. </year>
Reference-contexts: We expect this problem to be small, because most disease profiles in the Middleton B, Shwe M, Heckerman D,et al. 8 INTERNIST-1 KB have all categories of multivalued findings entered on relevant disease profiles <ref> [4] </ref>. For example, the disease profile of HEPATITIS ACUTE VIRAL includes the three findings SGOT 40 TO 119, SGOT 120 TO 400, or SGOT GTR THAN 400 which together encompass the entire range of abnormal SGOT values. <p> The developers of QMR report that, even after all the positive findings for a case have been entered, the addition of negative findings (to the set of negative findings entered initially) during an interaction with a clinician can increase QMR's diagnostic accuracy <ref> [4] </ref>. Similar limitations, however, apply to the use and evaluation of the algorithms we implemented, such as S. Within a decisiontheoretic framework, it is also possible to analyze a case in an interactive mode. <p> We are developing approximate methods to compute non-myopically the value of new information given an evidence set [18]. Techniques such as these may allow hypotheses to be iteratively generated and refined in a manner similar to the intended use of QMR <ref> [4] </ref>. 4 . 8 Shortcomings of the QMR-DT Belief Network Model Because the current QMR-DT KB is a straightforward reformulation of the INTERNIST-1 KB, both KBs suffer from many of the same shortcomings.

Reference-contexts: A physician or a computerbased diagnostic aid cannot iteratively hypothesize and refine a differential diagnosis with new evidence when all of the case evidence is given at once. QMR is intended to be used in a mixed initiative manner between system and physician user <ref> [5] </ref>. Unlike INTERNIST-1, which has a partitioning algorithm that allows the system to focus iteratively on different problem areas [6], QMR applies a scoring scheme once, and then provides other options to the user for solving difficult cases [7]. <p> We emphasize that QMR was not used in an interactive fashion and that the results presented herein represent its performance under constrained Middleton B, Shwe M, Heckerman D,et al. 16 evaluation conditions <ref> [5] </ref>. For example, note that in test case 23 the reference diagnosis is celiac sprue (Table 1). When this case was analyzed with QMR it did not provide a rank for the reference diagnosis, however, it listed malabsorption as its topmost diagnosis (Table 2).

Reference-contexts: Unlike INTERNIST-1, which has a partitioning algorithm that allows the system to focus iteratively on different problem areas [6], QMR applies a scoring scheme once, and then provides other options to the user for solving difficult cases <ref> [7] </ref>. Because we could not a priori define an experimental protocol to take advantage of these options in a controlled fashion, we were unable to employ a mixedinitiative approach in our evaluation of QMR performance. Thus, QMR performance may not reach its optimal level of accuracy in our evaluation.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we limit our analysis of QMR's performance to the rank-ordered list of diseases. Middleton B, Shwe M, Heckerman D,et al. 11 To compare diagnostic algorithms, we used a twosided Wilcoxon signed-rank test <ref> [8] </ref> in pairwise comparisons of rank ordering of diseases. Specifically we used the Wilcoxon test to compare the rank orderings of algorithm S with those of QMR and ITB. <p> Then, we use the value of 0.005 for P S2 (d + S (j) | F). We used a matched-pair t test to examine the difference in two correlation coefficients from two algorithms <ref> [8] </ref>. Using the SAM cases, we test two null hypotheses with a two-tailed matched-pair t test with a level of significance of p = 0.05.

Reference-contexts: For the purposes of our study, however, we use only the ranks of the reference diagnosis and acknowledge that our results represent only an initial laboratory evaluation of the various models and algorithms <ref> [9] </ref>. We also summarize the ranking performance of each algorithm by noting the number of reference diagnoses ranked in the top position, the top five positions, the top 10 positions, and the top 20 positions. These summaries of the ranks appear in Table 3.

Reference-contexts: These cases, however, are only an approximation of real clinical cases. The case creator or the case abstracter may introduce bias into the evidence set, due to differences in experience with similar clinical cases <ref> [10] </ref>. As described in Section 2.1, it was not always possible to map findings from a case into the finding representations present in QMR or INTERNIST-1.

Reference-contexts: It is possible that Henrions TopN algorithm <ref> [11] </ref> would be able to produce tight bounds on the posterior probabilities of diseases for large cases. In addition, the recursive decomposition algorithm [12] appears promising as an exact method to calculate the posterior probabilities of diseases in an acceptable amount of time in some cases.

Reference-contexts: Also, we could examine the effect of the systems differential on a physicians diagnostic beliefs or work-up plans. Eventually, it would be useful to perform a field evaluation of the QMR-DT system, similar to the field testing of QMR described in <ref> [16] </ref>. 4 . 7 Intended Use of QMR Middleton B, Shwe M, Heckerman D,et al. 25 We used QMR in this study in a manner different from that intended by the system's developers. Specifically, QMR is intended to be used by a physician in an interactive mode [17].

Reference-contexts: Specifically, QMR is intended to be used by a physician in an interactive mode <ref> [17] </ref>. Our use of QMR was limited to applying the QMR diagnostic algorithm once to each set of positive and negative findings. We did not provide the algorithm with additional positive or negative findings based on queries that can be generated by the algorithm.
