Abstract: This paper presents a method for localization of modeled objects that is general enough to cover articulated and other types of constrained models. The flexibility between components of the model are expressed as spatial constraints which are fused into the pose estimation process. The constraint fusion assists in obtaining a precise and stable pose of each object's component and in finding the correct interpretation. The proposed method can handle any constraint (including inequalities) between any number of different components of the model.

Reference-contexts: In other words the actual measurements are considered soft constraints whereas the constraints are considered strong. The fusion of the actual measurements and the constraints during the pose estimation process is performed using the Kalman filter and it is in accord with <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In addition local iterations [11] are performed in order to reduce the influence of the linearization effect on the final solution. Detailed explanation with full equations about the measurements and constraints fusion can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>.

Additionally, the method can be easily extended to handle flexible models made of elastic materials.

Reference-contexts: The information obtained from a measurement ^ u k;j is fused into the solution T with the same manner as we fuse measurements for a rigid object pose estimation. Detailed explanation of such a process can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. The information obtained from a constraint is fused as described in Section 5.1 but the constraints are now associated with components rather than with single points. <p> The interpretation method for each component is similar to that for a rigid body, as presented in <ref> [8] </ref>, where in our case there is additional a priori information about T k from the previously fused constraints. <p> In the case where every component contains several model points, there is no need to restrict the measurements to be 3D since the pose of the component can be estimated from projections (2D measurements) <ref> [8] </ref>. 7 Results 7.1 Simulated Data We applied our method to estimate the pose of a 2D constrained model consisting of single point components. We used the parametric modeler described in [7] which we developed based on our techniques.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we focus on the localization problem and we assume that the correspondence between the sensory data and the model features is given. In a further publication <ref> [9] </ref> we explore the interpretation problem and explain the manner in which we integrate the interpretation process with the localization process. 2 Formal Description of the Problem A constrained model M of a 3D object consists of a set of rigid components M = fC i g i=1n : Each component <p> The incremental fusion of measurements rather than batch fusion (fusing all the measurements at once) is important since it gives us the ability to easily incorporate a matching (interpretation) process into the estimation process as described in <ref> [9] </ref>. In some cases inequality constraints such as g (x) 0 can be appear. Examples of such inequality constraints can be found in articulated models such as scissors and robot arms that are limited in the range of feasible angles between parts. <p> The proposed scheme enables an efficient simultaneous matching procedure which allows incremental fusion of additional matches that improve the pose estimation and the search complexity of further matches (see <ref> [9] </ref>). 4. The existing methods of pose estimation of constrained models, deal with articulated objects and with constraints that are due to prismatic or revolute joints between the model components.

Reference-contexts: The accuracy of the estimate increases, as additional measurements are fused, i.e. k k1 ( k1 k is nonnegative definite).

Reference-contexts: Measurements of the 3D location of the points and the measurement uncertainty were obtained from stereo image pairs. This data is noisy due to digitization, inconsistent lighting and imprecise feature matching. The uncertainty due to noise was modeled according to the auto-correlation of the image features <ref> [14] </ref>. We estimated the pose of the lamp components from the noisy 3D measurements and from the constraints using our technique. The evaluated vector is a 23 3 dimensional location vector composed of the 23 locations of the model points.
