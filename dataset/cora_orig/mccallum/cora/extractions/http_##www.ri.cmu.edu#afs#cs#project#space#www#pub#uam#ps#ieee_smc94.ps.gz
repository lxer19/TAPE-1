Abstract: Underactuated manipulators are robot manipulators composed of both active and passive joints. The advantages of using such systems reside in the fact that they weight less and consume less energy than their fully-actuated counterparts, thus being useful for applications such as space robotics. Another interest reside in the reliability or fault-tolerant design of fully-actuated manipulators. If any of the joint actuators of such a device fails, one degree of freedom of the system is lost. It is usual in this situation to simply brake the failed joint and try to resume the task with less degrees of freedom available [7]. Following the methodology proposed in this work, the passive (failed) joint can still be controlled via the dynamic coupling with the active joints, and so the system can still make use of all of its degrees of freedom originally planned. The methodology proposed in this paper uses the dynamic coupling between the passive and the active joints in order to bring the passive joint angles to a desired set-point. Therefore, the control law and the performance of the system are completely dependent on the dynamic model. Since it is difficult to obtain the exact dynamic model of the system in general, considerable position errors and even instability can result in some cases. In this paper, we propose a variable structure controller to provide the system with the robustness necessary to perform tasks regardless of the modelling errors. Case studies are provided as a mean of illustration.

Reference-contexts: Not until recently researchers started working with the control problem of underactuated manipulators. In <ref> [1] </ref>, Arai and Tachi proved that, in a local sense, the number of active joints must be equal or greater than the number of passive ones in order to be possible to control the passive ones. They also developed a controller to bring all joints to their desired set-points. <p> It is assumed that all joints are equipped with position encoders. We will denote by n the total number of joints, and by r the number of actuators. The number of passive joints is thus . Following <ref> [1] </ref>, our method requires at least half of the joints being actuated. Also following the assumptions in [1], [11], we assume that there is enough dynamic coupling between the passive and the active joints. <p> We will denote by n the total number of joints, and by r the number of actuators. The number of passive joints is thus . Following <ref> [1] </ref>, our method requires at least half of the joints being actuated. Also following the assumptions in [1], [11], we assume that there is enough dynamic coupling between the passive and the active joints. It is clear that if this coupling is too small, it will be impossible to change the position of the passive joints by simply moving the active ones. <p> In this work, we will assume that this transmission is always possible, i.e., that there is enough dynamic coupling to drive the passive joints. Current work is being done on the characterization of this transmission, with a possible extension to optimal actuator placement. As shown in <ref> [1] </ref>, r joints can be controlled at any given instant. Thus, at the beginning of the operation, we can control all p passive joints (via dynamic coupling) and active ones. These r joints to be controlled are grouped in the vector . When , this vector contains only passive joints. <p> Here, we propose a VSC for the underactuated case. Differently from fully-actuated manipulators, underactuated ones cannot have all their joint accelerations controlled at every time step. Since they have only r actuators, it is possible to control r accelerations at a time <ref> [1] </ref>. The other p accelerations will depend on the r controlled ones. To see this, from the second line of (5) we have: (7) Thus, if we try to control , then is fixed and cannot be arbitrarily chosen. <p> Thus, this control law is robust enough for the problem in hand. As a matter of comparison with previous works in this area, we also ran simulations using the control law proposed in <ref> [1] </ref>, but without using the pre-acceleration phase in order to obtain comparable results. Namely, we repeated experiments #1 and #2, with and without the use of the full dynamic model, respectively. <p> Another possible approach to cope with the uncertainties in the system would be via the use of adaptive control techniques, as done by Gu and Xu [5]. We compared the proposed control law with the one presented in <ref> [1] </ref>, and showed that our scheme provides the system with a much greater deal of robustness, an important characteristic in this kind of highly coupled nonlinear dynamic system. 7 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work received partial support from the Brazilian National Council for Research and Development (CNPq).

Reference-contexts: The idea behind the VSC is to force the systems state trajectory to converge to a pre-defined surface in the state space. Once the system reaches this surface, it will slide along it to the origin; this is the reason for this surface being called sliding surface <ref> [4] </ref>. On the surface, the system dynamics are described by the equation of the surface and not by its original ones. Thus, modelling errors do not affect the systems performance after the sliding begins. <p> Second, a control law must guarantee that the sliding surface is reachable, and that the time it takes for the state trajectory to reach it is finite. This second requirement is guaranteed in a region close to the sliding surface if, in this region <ref> [4] </ref>, .

Reference-contexts: The passive joint cannot reach its set-point within a reasonable time, and the active joint continues to bounce trying to drive the passive joint to rest. If we compare now the present method with the one presented in <ref> [9] </ref>, we can affirm that our formulation is much simpler, and that the braking and settling times are much smaller. As for implementation purposes, the present control law requires the computation of the inertia matrix of the manipulator, M (q), which is a symmetric matrix.

Reference-contexts: They also developed a controller to bring all joints to their desired set-points. The drawback existent in this approach is that a very accurate model of the manipulator must be provided to the controller.

In this work also the authors used a controller which required an accurate model of the system. <p> We will denote by n the total number of joints, and by r the number of actuators.

It is clear that if this coupling is too small, it will be impossible to change the position of the passive joints by simply moving the active ones.
