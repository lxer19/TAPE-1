Title: Uncertain Inferences and Uncertain Conclusions  
Author: Henry E. Kyburg, Jr. 
Address: Rochester  
Affiliation: University of  
Abstract: Uncertainty may be taken to characterize inferences, their conclusions, their premises or all three. Under some treatments of uncertainty, the inference itself is never characterized by uncertainty. We explore both the significance of uncertainty in the premises and in the conclusion of an argument that involves uncertainty. We argue that for uncertainty to characterize the conclusion of an inference is natural, but that there is an interplay between uncertainty in the premises and uncertainty in the procedure of argument itself. We show that it is possible in principle to incorporate all uncertainty in the premises, rendering uncertainty arguments deductively valid. But we then argue (1) that this does not reflect human argument, (2) that it is computationally costly, and (3) that the gain in simplicity obtained by allowing uncertainty in inference can sometimes outweigh the loss of flexibility it entails.

Reference-contexts: This is the lottery "paradox." Carnap <ref> [ Carnap, 1968 ] </ref> , discussing the possibility of inductive logic using arguments conforming to schema II, argues that while people do seem to discuss arguments in the way suggested, it is to be understood as an abbreviation or shorthand for a more adequate view of induction, which should proceed strictly

Reference-contexts: uncertainty by means of belief functions [ Shafer, 1976; Smets and Kennes, 1994 ] , or probability functions, or classes of probability functions [ Levi, 1967; Levi, 1980 ] , or probability envelopes [ Walley, 1991 ] , or by fuzzi-ness [ Zadeh, 1975 ] , or by possibility measures <ref> [ Dubois and Prade, 1985 ] </ref> , or any other way.

Reference-contexts: These possibilities can be captured with the help of a notation suggested by Hempel <ref> [ Hempel, 1961 ] </ref> : Schema I U ncertainty-P remise 1 P remise 2 P (Conclusion) = r This represents an argument in which there are two premises, one of which expresses uncertainty (probability, belief, . . . ), and in which the conclusion is a statement expressing uncertainty explicitly. 2

Reference-contexts: According to other views, these premises represent the application of a principle such as a principle of indifference [ Laplace, 1951 ] or a principle of maximizing entropy over a set of answers <ref> [ Jaynes, 1957 ] </ref> . The justification for the premises is provided by these princi ples. While the former view seems too liberal to ensure agreement among cooperating agents, the latter seems too dictatorial. There is a middle ground, of course, which is often encountered in the real world.

Reference-contexts: But when we reject these premises as certainties, and seek to incorporate the evidence for them into schema I, we must worry anew about lottery problems <ref> [ Kyburg, 1961 ] </ref> , just as we must in schema II when what we are looking for is an argument for the conjunction in question. Example 10 : We are considering inviting John to join our Frisbee team. Practise isn't important, but native athletic ability is.

Reference-contexts: An attempt to provide a general semantics for inferences conforming to schema II has been made in [ Ky-burg, 1996 ] . Specifically statistical inferences have been explored in <ref> [ Kyburg, 1974 ] </ref> : what is sought there is exactly that middle ground referred to above, in which our knowledge about uncertainty is, like other knowledge, based on objective and public data, and methods of inference that may be characterized either as yielding the truth frequently or as succumbing to

Reference-contexts: But this is just the question of determining "the reference class" for the application of statistical knowledge; some of us do regard that as a serious problem, but it is not one I want to address here <ref> [ Kyburg, 1983 ] </ref> . The example illustrates a fairly uncontroversial and simple bit of Bayesian inference. We examined it in some detail because we wanted to be very clear that the inference involved is pure, mathematical, deductive, truth-preserving inference.

Reference-contexts: But there are two crucial differences. First, the procedure of inference is no longer assumed to be deductive. Inference, on this pattern; is not necessarily truth preserving. It could be inductive inference, what I have called `probabilistic inference' in other places <ref> [ Kyburg, 1988 ] </ref> , statistical inference in the classical form developed by Neyman and Pear-son [ Lehman, 1959 ] , and perhaps various other forms of inference such as inference by analogy.

Recall that the "procedure of inference" may involve many steps; all that is intended by this model is that at least some of the steps may not be truth preserving. <p> Uncertain inferences with categorical conclusions appear to be what have inspired those who work with nonmonotonic logic. They correspond to certain classes of classical statistical inference|confidence intervals, hypothesis testing <ref> [ Lehman, 1959 ] </ref> . How to deal with the non-conjunctive character of such inferences is a problem that is under investigation in a number of areas, but it is one for which no general agreed-upon solution exists. Our considerations suggest that this is a worthy area to explore.

In the probabilistic framework, the procedure is nothing less than classical conditionalization. 5 For belief functions it may be "Dempster conditioning" <ref> [ Shafer, 1976 ] </ref> . For other representations of probability, the procedure may be different again. The point is that each representation of uncertainty has its own "updating" procedures. <p> In terms of belief functions, for example, a "high" Bel value for P must be associated with a "low" Bel value for :P , and Bel applied to an exclusive disjunction must have at least as high a value as the sum of its values for the disjuncts <ref> [ Shafer, 1976 ] </ref> .
