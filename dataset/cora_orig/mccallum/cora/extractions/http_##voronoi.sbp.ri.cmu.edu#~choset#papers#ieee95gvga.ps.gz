Abstract: This paper introduces a 1-dimensional network of curves termed the Generalized Voronoi Graph (GVG) and its extension, the Hierarchical Generalized Voronoi Graph (HGVG), which can be used as a basis for a roadmap or retract-like structure. The GVG and HGVG provide a basis for sensor based path planning in an unknown static environment. In this paper, the GVG and HGVG are defined and some of their properties are exploited to show their utility for motion planning. A companion paper describes how to use the GVG and HGVG for the purposes of sensor based planning.

To show that the edges are 1-dimensional, we invoke the Pre-image Theorem <ref> [1] </ref> m 1 times on the difference of two distance functions. We first introduce the following two lemmas. Lemma 5.3 F 2 , F ij , and SS ij have co-dimension 1 in R m .

Reference-contexts: Rimon's approach is a sensor based extension of Canny and Lin's Opportunistic Path Planner (OPP) <ref> [4] </ref>. From a practical point of view, there are two detractions to Rimon's method. First, to construct the roadmap, the robot must contain "interesting critical point" and "minimum passage" sensors, whose implementation is not well described.

Reference-contexts: This section defines a distance function, and its gradient.A more complete discussion of these functions and their properties can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. We assume a point robot operating in a subset, W, of an m-dimensional Euclidean space. W is populated by obstacles C 1 ; ; C n which are convex sets. Non-convex obstacles are modeled as the union of convex shapes. <p> However, since it is defined in terms of the distance function, the HGVG readily lends itself to sensor based implementation [7]. Because of its graph-like structure, motion planning can be reduced to a 1-dimensional graph search. Simulations validating this approach for the case of 2-dimensions can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>, but simulations of the 3-dimensional case are under way. For the 3-dimensional case, it was shown that under a certain set of conditions the HGVG is connected. Proof of the higher dimensional case can be found in [6].

It can be shown <ref> [6] </ref>, [11] that there always exists a collision-free path from any point in the free space to a 2-Equidistant Face.

In <ref> [8] </ref> it is shown that the gradient of d i (x) is rd i (x) = kx c 0 k Thus, rd i (x) is a unit vector in the direction from c 0 to x, where c 0 is the nearest point to x in C i . <p> We first introduce the following two lemmas.

Reference-contexts: Our approach is to adapt the structure of a rigorous motion planning scheme to a sensor based implementation. There are three classes of complete motion planning schemes: cellular decomposition methods, potential field approaches, and retract or roadmap methods <ref> [9] </ref>. Roadmaps or retract-like structures capture the global topological properties of the robot's free space and have the following important properties: accessibility, departability and connectivity.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, current sensor based planning methods are limited because: (1) many are based on heuristic algorithms, and it is therefore impossible to prove if they will work in all possible environments; or (2) proof of convergence is limited to the case of 2-dimensional environments (for example, Lumelsky's "bug" algorithm <ref> [10] </ref>). The goal of this work is to develop provably correct motion planning schemes for workspace dimensions greater than two, and which can be robustly implemented with realistic sensors. Our approach is to adapt the structure of a rigorous motion planning scheme to a sensor based implementation.
