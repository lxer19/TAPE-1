Title: Providing Resource Management Services to Parallel Applications  
Author: Jim Pruyne Miron Livny 
Abstract: Because resource management (RM) services are vital to the performance of parallel applications, it is essential that parallel programming environments (PPEs) and RM systems work together. We believe that no single RM system is always the best choice for every application and every computing environment. Therefore, the interface between the PPE and the resource manager must be flexible enough to allow for customization and extension based on the environment. We present a framework for interfacing general PPEs and RM systems. This framework is based on clearly defining the responsibilities of these two components of the system. This framework has been applied to PVM, and two separate instances of RM systems have been implemented. One behaves exactly as PVM always has, while the second uses Condor to extend the set of RM services available to PVM applications.

Reference-contexts: Poor intra-job RM may cause users' programs to perform poorly because requests may be fulfilled using resources which are heavily loaded or do not closely match the application's requirements. A number of specialized batch resource management systems are currently available. Systems of this type include Condor <ref> [1] </ref>, DQS [2], and IBM's LoadLeveler. To use these systems, a user submits a job description file which specifies the program to be run, and the type of resource on which to run it. The RM system uses this description to find a suitable host on which to run.

Reference-contexts: The system may provide a default value for this field based on the type of request if the application writer does not specify a value when making a request. 3 Resource Management for PVM Our first implementation of the external resource manager architecture has been done using PVM <ref> [3] </ref>. PVM was chosen for a number of reasons. First, the PVM source code is available which makes experimentation possible. Second, PVM is widely used, and we hope that our work will benefit as many users as possible.
