Abstract: A feedback linearization controller design is presented for the speed control of an automobile engine. Various difficulties encountered along the process and their proposed solutions are explained in detail. The ultimate goal of this project is to mechanise these calculations and develop a CAD package which will be able to solve a wide range of practical problems. The method proposed will be valuable in designing a controller by using most of the strategies from the rapidly growing geometrical nonlinear control toolbox.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction There has been a great deal of progress, over the past decade, in theoretical techniques for the control of nonlinear systems, the most popular of these being feedback linearization (for example <ref> [1] </ref>). However, at the moment, there are very few documented examples of practical systems being controlled by this technique. This seems to be because of the following difficulties with the methodology: 1. Most of the computations involved are symbolic and the symbolic packages available (e.g.

Reference-contexts: We will first illustrate the method by way of an example: speed control of a car engine. We will use a CAD package for nonlinear control system design called AP LIN, developed at Berkeley. For a complete discussion of AP LIN refer to <ref> [2] </ref>. fl Research supported in part by ARO under grant DAAL - 91-G-0191 y Research supported by PATH 1 2 Example: Speed control of a typical American Car Engine To design a linearizing controller for the car engine, we will first obtain a model of the engine of the form of <p> x 1 1 10 6 x 3 1 A where x 1 = m a and x 2 = ! e With these functions the approximation error is uniformly less than a prespecified * 1 with x 1 2 [0; 6] Kg; x 2 2 [0; 500] rad/sec, ff 2 <ref> [0; 2 ] </ref>. As an example, we include a plot showing the actual and approximate throttle characteristic in fig (1). <p> The inputs in this set should be rich enough to excite all the modes of the system model. They should also cover the entire range of input magnitudes, ff 2 <ref> [0; 2 ] </ref>. One such input for the car model is shown in fig (2). The system (2) is simulated with these test inputs and then a polynomial approximation of the form of (1) is obtained.

Reference-contexts: In case of the above approximations, terms like 2 10 7 x 2 2 are not negligible as the engine speed x 2 is of the order of hundreds of radian per second. Once we obtain an analytical model, it will be used to design approximate controller. From <ref> [4] </ref>, we know that if the neglected terms are small enough, then the linearizing controller designed for the approximate system will provide satisfactory results for the original system. 2.1.3 Reduction of Model to Standard Form The analytical model is not in the standard format (1).
