Title: Group Allocation Multiple Access with Collision Detection

Abstract: The Group Allocation Multiple Access with Collision Detection (GAMA/CD) protocol for scheduling variable-length packet transmissions in a local area network is specified and analyzed. GAMA/CD provides the advantages of both TDMA and CSMA/CD by maintaining a dynamically-sized cycle that varies in length depending on the network load; each cycle is composed of a contention period and a group-transmission period. During the contention period, a station with one or more packets to send competes for membership in the transmission group. Once a member of the transmission group, a station is able to send data without collision during each cycle; as long as a station has data to send, it maintains its position in the group. This can be viewed as either allowing stations to "share the floor" in an organized manner, or as establishing frames that are not synchronized on a slot-basis and vary their length dynamically based on demand. Both the throughput and the delay of GAMA/CD are presented and analyzed. To validate our analysis, the results of both models are compared to the throughput and delay produced by a simulation of GAMA/CD.

Reference-contexts: In [7] and [13] window protocols are de-cribed which require that stations are synchronized in order to support time slotting. In [4] a protocol similar to GAMA/CD is described; however, this protocol requires time synchronization, and the frame size does not vary with the level of network traffic. In <ref> [1] </ref> a protocol that transmits voice packets over virtual circuits is described; voice traffic is given a higher priority than data traffic. Other schemes which use a token passing scheme are described in [11], [12] and [14].

Reference-contexts: During the contention period stations contend for membership in the "transmission group"; each group member is able to transmit data without collision during the tranmission period allocated to the station when it joined the transmission group. GAMA/CD uses a form of "limited sensing" as in <ref> [3] </ref> to allow a newly activated station to contend for group membership without knowing the entire state of the transmission group. When a station receives a message to transmit, it listens to the channel for 2t seconds, where t is the maximum end-to-end propagation delay.

Reference-contexts: When a contention period produces an error, the length of the contention period is equal to Y + 3t . Where Y represents the length of the overlap between colliding initial packets. This value as shown in <ref> [6] </ref> can be represented as: Y = t The 3t seconds represents the time before colliding stations realize a collision has occured plus the length of the jamming packet and the propagation delay for the jamming packet to reach the other stations.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Such medium access control (MAC) protocols as CSMA/CD <ref> [10] </ref> that require a station to contend for the ability to send each data packet of a message cannot provide performance guarantees. This is a significant problem for real-time multimedia applications requiring long-term connections and bounded jitter.
