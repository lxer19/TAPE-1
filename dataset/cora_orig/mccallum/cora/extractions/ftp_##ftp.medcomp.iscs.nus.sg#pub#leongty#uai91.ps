Abstract: This paper outlines a methodology for analyzing the representational support for knowledge-based decision-modeling in a broad domain. A relevant set of inference patterns and knowledge types are identified. By comparing the analysis results to existing representations, some insights are gained into a design approach for integrating categorical and uncertain knowledge in a context sensitive manner.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Research in knowledge-based decision systems (KBDS) combines artificial intelligence and decision analysis techniques to solve problems involving choice and uncertainty. The dynamic decision-modeling approach in KBDS advocates that the decision models for different problems should be dynamically constructed from a knowledge base <ref> [ Breese, 1989, Well-man, 1990a ] </ref> . This approach facilitates scalability and reusability of the knowledge bases. Moreover, the resulting decision models are context-sensitive and include only the relevant information specific to the problems. <p> Recognizing these conditions automatically requires a very sophisticated planner, and the issues involved are outside the scope of this paper. The main purpose of establishing a context is to al 1 This is different from the decision context <ref> [ Breese, 1989, Holtzman, 1989 ] </ref> which refers to all the assumptions, constraints, variables, and alternatives considered in the decision problem. low access to the context-sensitive information.

Reference-contexts: The domain and the decision-analytic components of the knowledge base are integrated by the knowledge-base manager , which also serves as an interface to the planner. The decision models considered are qualitative probabilistic networks (QPNs) <ref> [ Wellman, 1990b ] </ref> . Since QPNs are the qualitative variants of influence diagrams, and since each influence diagram can be transformed into a decision tree, our results are expected to be generalizable to other decision models. <p> These interactions are expressed in terms of the corresponding derived-concepts, e.g., "duration-of-treatment-of-cardiomyopathy negatively-influences severity-of-cardiomyopathy is an interaction in the description of cardiomyopathy. 5.1.2 Interactions of Concepts Each interaction between two concepts has two components: temporal precedence, with "known" or "unknown" as values, and qualitative probabilistic influence <ref> [ Wellman, 1990b ] </ref> , with "positive," "negative," and "unknown" as values.
