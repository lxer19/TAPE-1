Abstract: We describe an infeasible-interior-point algorithm for monotone variational inequality problems and prove that it converges globally and superlinearly under standard conditions plus a constant rank constraint qualification. The latter condition represents a generalization of the two types of assumptions made in existing superlinear analyses; namely, linearity of the constraints and linear independence of the active constraint gradients.

Reference-contexts: The coefficient matrix in (12) is the same for both fast and safe steps, so only one matrix factorization is required per iteration. The safe-step procedure is defined as follows. safe (z; ; y; t; fl; fi): choose ~oe 2 [oe; 1 2 ], ff 0 2 <ref> [ ff; 1] </ref>; solve (12) to find (z; ; y); choose ff to be the first element in the sequence ff 0 ; Off 0 ; O 2 ff 0 ; : : :, such that the following conditions are satisfied: i (ff)y i (ff) fl (ff); (16a) kr g (z <p> Then the set of multipliers fl fl defined in Assumption 6 is polyhedral, convex, and compact, hence is equal to the convex hull of its extreme points. Proof. Clearly fl fl is a polyhedral, convex set. Boundedness follows from Gauvin <ref> [1] </ref> if we can show that the Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification holds at z fl . <p> Suppose S Z contains (z; ), where z is remote from z fl . By convexity, we also have (1 ff)(z fl ; fl ) + ff (z; ) 2 S Z for all ff 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Since (1 ff)z fl + ffz ! z fl as ff # 0, it follows from local uniqueness that z = z fl . Note that Lemmas 2 and 3 together imply that S Z is compact. Finally, we state the constant rank assumption.

Reference-contexts: It is well known <ref> [2] </ref> that, under suitable conditions on g such as the famous Slater constraint qualification, z solves (1) if and only if there exists a multiplier such that (z; ) solves (3). We solve (1) by a method based on the interior-point algorithm of Wright and Ralph [10]. <p> Proof. Convexity of S Z follows from Proposition 3.1 of Harker and Pang <ref> [2] </ref>, since the NCP (3) is a equivalent to a monotone variational inequality over a closed convex set. The invertibility condition, Assumption 6, implies that for (z; ) in S Z near (z fl ; fl ), we must have z = z fl . <p> Lemma 13 Suppose that Assumptions 1 and 3 hold and that the set C defined by (2) is bounded. Then the solution set S is nonempty, bounded, closed, and therefore compact. Proof. By Theorem 3.1 of Harker and Pang <ref> [2] </ref>, the set of vectors z fl that solves (1) is nonempty. This set is also bounded because of the restriction z fl 2 C. Boundedness of the solution components y fl follows trivially because y fl = g (z fl ) and g is smooth.

Reference-contexts: Of course w k ! w, and since h k ! h 6= 0, we have kw k k ! khk contradicting (82). On the one hand, Lemma 10 extends Hoffman's lemma <ref> [3] </ref> by allowing H to vary within a set H rather than remain constant. On the other hand, Hoffman's lemma is more general in that it applies to linear systems of inequalities as well as equalities.

Reference-contexts: Instead, this matrix satisfies a constant column rank condition (Theorem 4), and this condition is enough to yield the desired bound (Lemmas 10 and 11). We start by proving a novel variant of a lemma from Monteiro and Wright <ref> [4, Lemma 2.2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Since (1 ff)z fl + ffz ! z fl as ff # 0, it follows from local uniqueness that z = z fl . Note that Lemmas 2 and 3 together imply that S Z is compact. Finally, we state the constant rank assumption. See Pang and Ralph <ref> [5] </ref> for some discus sion on this and related conditions.

Reference-contexts: To prove this result, we use a simple technique due to Polak <ref> [6, Chapter 1] </ref>. We start by formalizing our assumptions on and g. Assumption 1 : IR N ! IR N is C 1 and monotone; and each component function g i of g : IR N ! IR P is C 2 and convex.

Neither of these formulations applies explicitly to the mixed problem. In the case of linear problems, a mixed framework is unnecessary in any case, since there are strong equivalence relationships between mixed problems and nonmixed problems. <p> These equations are simply the Newton equations for the nonlinear system mentioned earlier, except for the ~oe term. The algorithms searches along the direction obtained from (12). In the algorithm of Wright and Ralph <ref> [10] </ref> (which applies to nonmixed NCP), the search for ff takes place along a curved arc rather than a straight line. The curvature on this arc ensures that the residual term decreases linearly with ff. <p> It is not clear how to extend this strategy to the mixed case, so the algorithm in this paper uses a simpler straight-line search. The global and local convergence properties are essentially the same as in <ref> [10] </ref>. At each iteration, the algorithm computes a fast step|a pure Newton step for which ~oe = 0 in (12). If the fast step fails to give a sufficiently large decrease in , we revert to a safe step by assigning a positive value to ~oe. <p> We deduce that ff ^ff = min ( ff; O ^ff (4) ); and our proof is complete. The global convergence result and its proof are similar to Theorem 3.3 of Wright and Ralph <ref> [10] </ref>. Theorem 1 Suppose that Assumptions 1 and 2 hold. Then either 13 (A) (z k ; k ; y k ) 2 S for some k &lt; 1, or (B) all limit points of f (z k ; k ; y k )g belong to S. Proof. <p> Assumption 6 is a weak version of the better-known condition that the "active" sub-matrix (115) of the Jacobian (6) is invertible|an assumption that is made in most local convergence analyses of nonlinear programming algorithms including Wright and Ralph <ref> [10] </ref>. Allowing nonzero vectors ffi in the null space of the above Jacobian matrix amounts to allowing nonunique optimal multipliers ; this flexibility relies on the constant rank condition, Assumption 7.

Reference-contexts: for some K k J , the first term on the right-hand side dominates the second, and we have k+1 ^o+1 The proof that f k g converges to zero with Q-order at least 1 + ^o follows by standard arguments; see Wright [9, Theorem 6.3] and Wright and Zhang <ref> [11, Theorem 5.2] </ref>. Hence, part (i) of the theorem is proved. For (ii), we show that the sequence of iterates is Cauchy.
