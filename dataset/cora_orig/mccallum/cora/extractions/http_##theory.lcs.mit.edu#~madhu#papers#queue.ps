Reference-contexts: We restrict ourselves to the case in which the path traversed by each packet is fixed at the time of injection (i.e. non adaptive routing), so as to be able to focus on the queueing rather than routing aspects of the problem. (Recently, Aiello et al. <ref> [1] </ref> have successfully extended the adversarial model to adaptive routing.) Clearly an unrestricted adversary can flood the network with packets, demanding more bandwidth than available. Therefore we need to introduce a restriction analogous to the usual load condition imposed in queueing theory.

Reference-contexts: Hence queueing theory clearly provides a general methodology for studying continuous packet routing. However, our initial results coupled with the subsequent compelling results of Andrews et al. <ref> [2] </ref> demonstrate that the fl Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada M5S 3G4. Part of this work was performed while visiting the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. y Department of Computer Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. <p> We say that such a (w; ) adversary injects packets at rate with window size w. A rate adversary is a (w; ) adversary for some w 2 . 2 We follow the definition of a (w; ) adversary as it appears in Andrews et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. In our original paper [7], we only defined and proved results for path-packing adversaries (to be defined) although we implicitly suggested a more general adversary. In subsequent discussions, we independently adopted the general (w; ) adversarial framework. <p> Our main goal will be to prove the stability of arbitrary and particular greedy scheduling policies 4 S on various networks G and against various classes of adversaries 3 . Similar to Andrews et al. <ref> [2] </ref>, we define a network system as the tuple (G; ; S). <p> Andrews, Awerbuch, Fernandez, Kleinberg, Leighton and Liu <ref> [2] </ref> show that for undirected networks (i.e. in the sense that each undirected edge represents two directed edges) it is decidable if a packet routing network is universally stable. Based on Andrews et al., Goel [21] gives a simple characterization for the universal stability of directed and undirected networks. <p> In our conference paper [7] we asked if our stability results for the ring and DAGs could be extended to all networks and all greedy scheduling rules. Our results were soon significantly extended by Andrews, Awerbuch, Fernandez, Kleinberg, Leighton and Liu <ref> [2] </ref>. They show that the ring is universally stable with respect to the class of rate &lt; 1 deterministic adversaries. They also show that certain scheduling policies S (such as Newest in System (NIS), LIS and FTG) are universally stable against the class of rate &lt; 1 deterministic adversaries. <p> This proof easily generalizes to any dimensional array and also to stochastic adversaries. The same idea can be applied to toroidal networks using the Andrews et al. <ref> [2] </ref> universal stability results for unidirectional rings. However without the one bend routing assumption, the instability results of Andrews et al. [2] show that (two dimensional) meshes are not universally stable networks. 5 The ring There are now a number of independent results (for different queueing model assumptions) showing that the <p> This proof easily generalizes to any dimensional array and also to stochastic adversaries.

Andrews et al. <ref> [2] </ref> prove that FTG is stable for any network at rate &lt; 1. Tsaparas [44] generalizes the Andrews et al. FTG stability result to more general queueing networks by proving the universal stability of Most-Time-To-Go (MTTG) scheduling. <p> of class independent service times), it is stable for Poisson arrivals and class independent service times. * Is there a generic transformation of stability results from deterministic to stochastic adver saries? * Our queue size bound for DAGs is exponential in the number of nodes and indeed Andrews et al. <ref> [2] </ref> show that NIS and FTG can be made to suffer exponential size queues on DAGs.

Reference-contexts: In fact, as one might expect in such a well-studied field, our "new approach" is not entirely new.

However, the fluid model results do not seem to provide quantitative bounds on queue lengths.

Reference-contexts: body of the paper. 6 These queueing network examples do not show that NTG is unstable for packet routing (where we assume identical service time distributions) but can be easily modified to show packet routing instability for some priority based scheduling policy. 6 4 DAGs and Meshes Perkins and Kumar <ref> [38] </ref> show that for constant rate arrivals there is a class of scheduling rules (called "clear a fraction") with respect to which all acyclic networks are stable. Using a fluid model, Down and Meyn [18] consider a specific acyclic network and show that it is universally stable.

Reference-contexts: We could also easily define randomized scheduling policies but will not do so since we do not consider such policies in this paper. However, we note that randomized scheduling policies are often utilized in packet routing; see, for example, Rabani and Tardos <ref> [39] </ref>. Our main goal will be to prove the stability of arbitrary and particular greedy scheduling policies 4 S on various networks G and against various classes of adversaries 3 . Similar to Andrews et al. [2], we define a network system as the tuple (G; ; S).

Reference-contexts: It also subsumes the case of oblivious packet routing for packets that are generated at each node with randomly chosen destinations (e.g., as studied in <ref> [26, 27, 42] </ref>). To differentiate such stochastic adversaries from the non-stochastic adversaries defined above, we will refer to the non-stochastic adversaries as deterministic adversaries. To the best of our knowledge, these adversarial models provide the first framework for studying queueing models where we do not essentially assume independent input streams.

Reference-contexts: For class independent service rates, Dai and Weiss [16] prove universal stability for fluid models (and hence for time-invariant stochastic queueing networks under the same assumption of class independent service rates). Tassiulas and Georgiadis <ref> [43] </ref> establish the analogous result for packet routing using the Cruz [13] leaky bucket model. Andrews et al. [2] show that the ring is universally stable with respect to deterministic adversaries. We shall now show that the scheduling rule FTG is stable at rate 1 for the ring.

Reference-contexts: The "leaky bucket" model studied by Cruz [13, 14] should also be considered as a (restricted) adversarial model. We introduce our adversarial model and for definiteness present this model in the context of packet routing. More generally this adversarial approach can be applied to any queueing network; see Tsaparas <ref> [44] </ref>. Surprisingly, in spite of the power of the adversary, certain networks and scheduling disciplines can be proven to be "universally stable". That is, certain networks are stable under any greedy scheduling rule and certain scheduling rules are stable for any network. <p> Andrews et al. [2] prove that FTG is stable for any network at rate &lt; 1. Tsaparas <ref> [44] </ref> generalizes the Andrews et al. FTG stability result to more general queueing networks by proving the universal stability of Most-Time-To-Go (MTTG) scheduling. <p> Thus at the end of the phase (and the start of the next phase) there are T 0 = T + nM 2M &gt; T jobs in the system since n &gt; 2. Tsaparas <ref> [44] </ref> provides a careful proof of this intuitive idea. In particular, his proof requires an initial configuration which is very "symmetric" and then shows that this symmetry is preserved throughout the process so that new walls are formed without any breaks occurring in the walls. <p> We claim that for n &gt; 3 that the packet routing network system (G; N T G; A) is unstable where A is an "adversary" which is generating packets in each class at constant rate . Again the proof of this claim can be found in <ref> [44] </ref>. 7 Conclusion We have introduced a new approach for the study of queueing networks. Although our motivation comes from continuous packet routing, we note that the adversarial approach can be applied more generally to the wider field of queueing theory (as is done in Tsaparas [44]). <p> can be found in <ref> [44] </ref>. 7 Conclusion We have introduced a new approach for the study of queueing networks. Although our motivation comes from continuous packet routing, we note that the adversarial approach can be applied more generally to the wider field of queueing theory (as is done in Tsaparas [44]). We can view dynamic packet routing as one restrictive (but still quite non-trivial) type of multiclass queueing network.
