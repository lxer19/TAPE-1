Title: More On Goal-Directed Diagnosis

Abstract: In many diagnosis-and-repair domains, diagnostic reasoning cannot be abstracted from repair actions, nor from actions necessary to obtain diagnostic information. We call these exploratory-corrective domains. In Traum-AID 2.0, a consultation system for multiple trauma management, we have developed and implemented a framework for reasoning in such domains which integrates diagnostic reasoning with planning and action. In this paper, we present Goal-Directed Diagnosis (GDD), the diagnostic reasoning component of this framework. Taking the view that a diagnosis is only worthwhile to the extent that it can affect subsequent decisions, GDD focuses on the formation of appropriate goals for its complementary planner.

Reference-contexts: In addition, overloading rules makes them less interpretable: the separate function of each of a rule's antecedents becomes unclear (cf. <ref> [Clancey 83] </ref>). Instead, inhibiting relationships between goals and between goals and conclusions can be specified separately. For each goal g, we can define an inhibition clause which will then be compiled (as a macro expansion) into all of that goal's goal-setting rules.

Reference-contexts: The GDD paradigm, presented here, is part of a total approach for reasoning in exploratory-corrective domains which combines diagnostic reason ing, planning and action [Rymon 93]. In that framework, the main purpose of diagnostic reasoning is generating proper goals; diagnosis purely for characterization's sake becomes a secondary concern. <ref> [Friedrich et al 91] </ref> share much of that insight. Considering diagnosis as part of an overall diagnosis-and-repair process, they correctly observe that repair does not always require a complete diagnostic explanation. Unlike other formalizations, their theory has no explicit notion of a diagnosis.

Reference-contexts: Of course, researchers have realized that this approach is inadequate: "One limitation of dart in its present form is that it doesn't take into account the cost of tests .... Unfortu nately, the evaluation of test cost can be quite difficult because of dependencies on sequencing and grouping." <ref> [Genesereth 84] </ref> Planning researchers, as early as strips, have studied these issues extensively. The ECM architecture thus uses its planning capabilities not only for repair, but also for information acquisition. It also uses planning to mediate between diagnostic and therapeutic activities when multiple problems concurrently require both [Rymon 93].

Reference-contexts: New observations result in a modified diagnostic problem, and a new cycle is initiated. In this section, we describe a rule-based language for specifying diagnostic problems in GDD a corresponding inference scheme. 3.1 Underlying Framework: Multi-Valued Logics Multi-Valued Logics (MVL) <ref> [Ginsberg 88] </ref> is a formal framework for inference in which each proposition is assigned not only a truth value, corresponding to the strength of belief in that proposition being true or false, but also a knowledge assessment, measuring roughly the amount of knowledge used to derive such belief. <p> In contrast, TraumAID uses a rule-based representation which is simpler to handle, but incomplete in general. Instead of reconstructing TraumAID's knowledge, we chose to specialize Ginsberg's theory to the rule-based case. While the material presented next is self-contained, the reader is referred to <ref> [Ginsberg 88] </ref> for a more complete coverage of MVL. 3.2 Attitude and Belief During the diagnostic process, the GDD reasoner will maintain and update an attitude and a belief for propositional statements. <p> Technically, the extreme points in the belief bilattice are called T, and F, whereas same points are called R (for relevant) and I (for irrelevant) in the attitude bilattice. Extensions to more complex bilat-tices are discussed in <ref> [Ginsberg 88, Rymon 93] </ref> We shall say that an attitude-belief is strongly grounded if belief is restricted to fT, Fg. We shall say that it is weakly grounded if such restriction holds for all relevant propositions. 3.3 Goals Goals are a semantic interpretation of an attitude-belief assignment to propositions. <p> The basic inference is simpler and more intuitive than that in <ref> [Ginsberg 88] </ref>. In Section 5, we will have to extend it to a form that is closer to Ginsberg's in order to support reasoning about contradictory information. In order to define the basic inferential closure, let us first define the semantic interpretation of rules. <p> One may argue this to be a good feature of our inference system, since ? will often lead to a host of problems (see <ref> [Ginsberg 88] </ref>). On the other hand, ?=T+F, and can thus be used to represent the co-presence of contradictory evidence. Explicit representation of contradictions provides a system with important flexibility. Consider, for example, the diagnosis of a Tension Pneumothorax 4 (TP). Two alternative methods can be used for that purpose: 1.

Reference-contexts: To understand this view, consider that general theories of diagnosis give rise to a (sometimes large) number of hypothetical characterizations that are consistent with, or that explain the observed failure. In such instances, it is necessary to choose among such possibilities. An important observation made by <ref> [Poole & Provan 90] </ref> is that the optimality of a diagnosis must depend on post-diagnosis goals.

Reference-contexts: An important observation made by [Poole & Provan 90] is that the optimality of a diagnosis must depend on post-diagnosis goals.

Reference-contexts: Bilattices, in which one partial order corresponds to the truthfulness measure and the other to the knowledge one, are used by MVL as domains for truth-value assignment. Our goal-directed diagnostic paradigm (GDD) was first formalized using a three-valued logic: true, false and unknown <ref> [Rymon et al 91] </ref>. This paper presents an MVL-based reformulation of GDD. The immediate result of this reformulation is the ability to extend the inference paradigm to more expressive domains in a consistent fashion. Importantly, it allows explicit representation of contradictions (cf. section 5).

Reference-contexts: Realistically, diagnosis is rarely an independent process: more often it serves the purpose of another process, e.g. repair. The GDD paradigm, presented here, is part of a total approach for reasoning in exploratory-corrective domains which combines diagnostic reason ing, planning and action <ref> [Rymon 93] </ref>. In that framework, the main purpose of diagnostic reasoning is generating proper goals; diagnosis purely for characterization's sake becomes a secondary concern. [Friedrich et al 91] share much of that insight. <p> The ECM architecture thus uses its planning capabilities not only for repair, but also for information acquisition. It also uses planning to mediate between diagnostic and therapeutic activities when multiple problems concurrently require both <ref> [Rymon 93] </ref>. That strong tie between diagnosis and therapy is common in medical practice and is evident in many AI medical management systems 1 . <p> A more detailed technical comparison between AMORD and the MVL-based inference system used to implement GDD can be found in <ref> [Rymon 93] </ref>. 3 A Formulation of Goal-Directed Diagnosis Goal-Directed Diagnosis (GDD) begins with the point of view that diagnosis is only worthwhile if it has the potential to affect future decisions. <p> Technically, the extreme points in the belief bilattice are called T, and F, whereas same points are called R (for relevant) and I (for irrelevant) in the attitude bilattice. Extensions to more complex bilat-tices are discussed in <ref> [Ginsberg 88, Rymon 93] </ref> We shall say that an attitude-belief is strongly grounded if belief is restricted to fT, Fg. We shall say that it is weakly grounded if such restriction holds for all relevant propositions. 3.3 Goals Goals are a semantic interpretation of an attitude-belief assignment to propositions. <p> Goal inhibition, a third mechanism which we have found useful in implementing such strategies, is presented next. For lack of space, we will not present the strategies themselves; the interested reader is referred to <ref> [Rymon 93] </ref>. Trauma management presents an on-going interplay between diagnosis and therapy in which goals often have to be delayed or even ignored. <p> The first problem is a technical one: under the above inference scheme, ? propagates itself. We call that problem pollution, and a few hints as to how to deal with it can be found in <ref> [Rymon 93] </ref>. The second problem is the semantic interpretation of ?, i.e. what to do with a proposition for which a ? belief (attitude) is assigned? Unfortunately, the answer here varies. In some cases, a positive default is appropriate whereas in other circumstances a negative one is more plausible. <p> Planning is used to address and mediate between concurrent diagnostic and therapeutic needs. The new MVL-based formalization of GDD extends the original paradigm and allows reasoning with contradictory information and with defaults. A number of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies were shown to be naturally implementable in this framework <ref> [Rymon 93] </ref>.
