Abstract: This paper discusses the considerations that influenced the design of Matsad. Particular attention is given to a discussion of the priorities that guided the system's design. A brief review of the stencil mechanism is presented. Engineering design is about creating artefacts that fulfil a need to the best of the ability of current technology. Good design involves insightful decisions on what is important, and what should be given priority. In this paper we present a personal assessment of the needs of those involved in the development of the mathematics of program construction. We discuss the nature of proof, and the priorities for software tools. Our view of such tools has been realised in Matsad, a system that facilitates the writing of mathematical documents. We briefly describe the main elements of the system and how they contribute to the achievement of our goals. We also briefly discuss future developments of the system.

Reference-contexts: Complification is typical, for example, in proofs by induction. An excellent illustration is Henk Doornbos's relation-algebraic proof of Newman's lemma <ref> [1] </ref>. The first step in the proof is to replace the composition R ffi S of 4 two relations R and S by R ffi I ffi S (I being the unit of the composition operator).

Reference-contexts: The main tools used by the group to carry out their work were (and still are) paper and pencil. The group's work is intended to advance the "calculational method". (See <ref> [2] </ref> and [4] for illustrations of the method.) The primary goal is to reduce as much as possible of program construction to straightforward syntactic calculation. The main obstacle to progress is the tension between concision and precision | present in all scientific disciplines but particularly acute in computer programming.

Reference-contexts: In recent years, for example, the group has made contributions to constructive type theory, relation algebra and category theory (all in the context of program construction). The prototype of the Matsad system, developed by Paul Chisholm <ref> [3] </ref>, enabled the group to experiment with performing calculations directly at a computer terminal rather than doing them first on paper. 1.2 Avoiding the Introduction of Error Performing algebraic calculations at a computer terminal and doing them by hand with paper and pencil are quite different sorts of activities. <p> The resulting prototype system, the design of which was formulated in intensive discussions between Paul Chisholm and Roland Backhouse, was implemented by Chisholm with technical support from Harm Paas, and became available for general use in 1990 <ref> [3] </ref>. Chisholm's proof editor was also a structure editor and its principal design element was a flexible mechanism for on-the-fly definition of mathematical notations (the "stencils" of the current system). In particular, the definition and use of associative operators was facilitated.

The main obstacle to progress is the tension between concision and precision | present in all scientific disciplines but particularly acute in computer programming. <p> In order to illustrate the use of stencils we have extracted various notational elements from the book "A Logical Approach to Discrete Math" by David Gries and Fred B. Schnei-der <ref> [4] </ref>. and incorporated them in the stencil "Gries-Schneider". This stencil, as it appears on the screen is shown in fig. 1. Like all authors, Gries and Schneider have their own style for presenting definitions, 8 theorems etc., and their own notational conventions for constructing mathematical expressions.

About 100 installations were unsuccessful, primarily due to missing systems software. </title> <type> 14 </type>
