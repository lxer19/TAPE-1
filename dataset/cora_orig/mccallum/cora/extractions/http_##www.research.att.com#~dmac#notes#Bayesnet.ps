Reference-contexts: You could be wrong. Although many AI researchers prefer other nonprobabilistic formalisms, 1 it is possible to construct and use probabilistic approaches to common sense reasoning. The advantages of the probabilistic approaches to common sense are described quite well in <ref> [ Pearl, 1988 ] </ref> .
