Abstract: This paper contains an investigation of the relationship between rhetorical relations and intentions. Rhetorical relations are claimed to be actions, and thus the proper objects of intentions, although some relations may occur be independent of intentions. Explicit identification of particular relations is shown to be not always necessary when this information can be captured There are a number of different types of relationships between proximate segments of language, as well as a number of terms used to differentiate groups of these types. For the present purposes I make no distinction (as do, e.g. [Sidner; Moser and Moore]) between affective and other types of discourse coherence relations. Since my primary interest is in conversation (rather than, say, single producer text), I also include relations between utterances by different speakers. Another dimension along which a distinction could be made is what exactly is being related? Are relations between explicit spans of language text or between elements of the expressed contents of texts or perhaps mixes between these categories? Again, I will not make any such distinctions here, and simply use the term rhetorical relations to refer to any of these relations. As with other types of linguistic meaning, there are both Semantic and Pragmatic views of rhetorical relations. Semantic views concentrate on whether or not a relationship can be inferred from features of the discourse and what other information can be inferred when the relation holds or does not. Pragmatic views are more concerned with how a relationship is established and what effects this relationship (or lack of relationship) has on the context. 1 For the purposes of engaging in conversation and relating rhetorical relations to intentions, I take the pragmatic viewpoint as more central, although both are important. From the pragmatic viewpoint, rhetorical relations are the same general kind of thing as speech acts or actions in general: abstractions of agent-directed change in the world, in this case change in the conversational and metal state of the conversants. The only difference between speech acts and rhetorical relations is that the latter are explicitly concerned with the linkage of separate segments fl Appears in Proceedings ACL SIG Workshop on Intentionality and Structure in Discourse Relations, pages 132-135, June 1993.

I would like to thank James Allen and Peter Heeman for helpful discussions. in other ways, nevertheless, relations are often useful both in planning and recognition.

Reference-contexts: to draw the distinction made in speech act theory between illocutionary acts, those in which part of the intended effect includes an awareness on the part of the hearer of this intention, and perlocutionary acts, in which it is only the effect that matters and not recognition of the intention <ref> [Austin, 1962] </ref>. For non-illocutionary acts, the intention of the speaker is not relevant these actions can be produced as side-effects of the speaker's intention, so that a determination of the intention is not necessary to determining whether the act was performed.

Reference-contexts: Plan recognition is the process of reasoning about an agent's mental state (including intentions, beliefs, and goals) based on observed actions in context. Intentions are commitments towards a course of action. <ref> [Bratman, 1990] </ref> discusses three roles that intention plays in deliberative behavior: serving as a motivation for planning, a "filter of admissibility" on plans and further intentions, and a controller of conduct, motivating execution monitoring and repair and replanning when necessary.

Reference-contexts: Of course, relations could be identified based on how the content is treated with respect to previous content, but that doesn't seem helpful presently. This is particularly true for subject matter relations. For example, a purpose clause is useful for the domain plan recognizer <ref> [Ferguson and Allen, 1993] </ref> in incorporating new content into an existing (partial) plan, but in the absence of such a cue, the recognizer will still try to connect the new content to previous content.

Reference-contexts: Those relations that are conventionally signalled by surface features (e.g. by clue words such as "so", "no", "okay", purpose clauses) are hypothesized by the Speech Act Interpreter <ref> [Heeman, 1993] </ref> and used by the Dialogue Manager [Traum, 1993] to guide further interpretation. In the case of more implicit relationships we often do not identify the precise relation, merely operating on the speech act level forms.

Reference-contexts: For non-illocutionary acts, the intention of the speaker is not relevant these actions can be produced as side-effects of the speaker's intention, so that a determination of the intention is not necessary to determining whether the act was performed. For example, the evidence relation of <ref> [Mann and Thompson, 1987] </ref> may hold between two text spans even if the speaker did not intend such a relation, all that is required is that the hearer's belief in the nucleus is increased though the understanding of the satellite.
