Abstract: We establish worst-case and average-case lower bounds on the trade-off between the time and bit complexity for two-party communication in synchronous networks. We prove that the bounds are tight by presenting a protocol which has bit-time complexity matching the ones expressed by the lower bounds. We actually show that the algorithm is everywhere optimal: at any point of the trade-off and for any universe of data to be communicated, no other solution has better complexity to communicate any element of that universe (within a fixed relabelling). Similar results are derived when transmissions are subject to corruptions.

Reference-contexts: The tradeoff between time and bits is, unfortunately, not linear. For example, using only a constant k &gt; 2 number of bits, the time complexity can be reduced to sublinear; e.g., <ref> [10, 12] </ref>. Several solutions have been presented each offering different trade-offs. Unfortunately, previous to this work, no lower-bounds were known on the time-bit complexity making it difficult to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed solutions. <p> Notice that q 0 = b y 2 c = b p 2 c and, since z 2b p xc, then q 1 = b w b z 2 c p 2 ; thus, this protocol has time-bits complexity at most hb xc + 3; 3i (e.g., see <ref> [10] </ref>). A solution protocol for R b (U ) can be obtained by extending the protocol for R 3 (U ). For simplicity, let k = b1 be a power of two.
