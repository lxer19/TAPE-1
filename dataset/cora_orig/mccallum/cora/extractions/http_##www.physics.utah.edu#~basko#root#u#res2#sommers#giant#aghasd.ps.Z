Abstract: Recent reports of superhigh energy cosmic rays beyond the expected spectral cutoff has intensified interest in the unknown origin of the highest energy cosmic rays. There is a need for a much larger data base of more precisely measured air showers. This requires new sensitive detectors of enormous aperture. Combining a ground array of particle counters with an optical detector of atmospheric fluorescence yields a detector of outstanding capability. Such a hybrid detector provides far more accurate measurements of energies, arrival directions, and primary particle atomic masses than can be achieved by either type of detector separately.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction There have been several workshops in recent years discussing ideas for a giant air shower detector to study the highest energy cosmic rays <ref> [1] </ref>. Attention has focussed on a possible hybrid configuration in order to exploit simultaneously the advantages of a ground array of particle detectors and the advantages of viewing an air shower above the surface via atmospheric 1 fluorescence [2, 3, 4].

Reference-contexts: The spectral flattening (ankle) just below 10 EeV invites the interpretation that the highest energy cosmic rays constitute a different population from the cosmic rays of lower energy. That view has been reinforced by the Fly's Eye results <ref> [5] </ref>, which indicate that there is a change in the chemical composition near the spectrum's ankle. Below the ankle, the distribution of shower depths of maximum development is consistent with a population of heavy nuclei.

Reference-contexts: The absence of evident anisotropy supports the view that extremely high energy cosmic rays of galactic origin must be low-rigidity heavy nuclei, and the light population of particles at the highest energies cannot originate in the Galaxy's disk. Especially intriguing are the recent reports <ref> [6, 7] </ref> of two superhigh energy particles well beyond the expected spectral cutoff [8, 9] due to particle interactions with universal low energy photons. Haverah Park [10], Volcano Ranch [11], and the Sydney SUGAR array [12] found evidence for cosmic rays just above 100 EeV.

This is an enigma which motivates a search for many more such particles. A superhigh energy nucleon suffers multiple pion photoproduction interactions until its energy falls below the GZK cutoff energy. From each pion-producing interaction it is approximately equally likely to emerge as a neutron or a proton.

Reference-contexts: The fact that anisotropy has not so far been established, however, means that a much larger exposure is required. J. Cronin has advocated building a 5000 km 2 detector in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres to gain good exposure to the entire sky <ref> [17] </ref>. A single 5000 km 2 detector is expected to measure about 5000 showers per year above 10 EeV. In five years it would collect about 25,000 showers over approximately 2 sr of the sky. <p> the electromagnetic particle cascade. (If a distant shower is ob 4 served only near its maximum development, the size at maximum is itself a good estimator of the shower's energy.) The ground array independently estimates the shower energy by evaluating the particle density at 1000m (or 600m) from the core <ref> [17, 18] </ref>. The total shower size at ground level is estimated from the ground stations by fitting the measured densities to a lateral distribution function.

Reference-contexts: Other shower parameters measured by the detector may also have sensitivity to composition, for example the muon pulse rise time and the muon/electromagnetic ratio at large distance from the core. D. Nitz has explored the power of combining all such parameters in a multidimensional analysis of composition <ref> [19] </ref>. 2.3 Geometric reconstruction and angular resolution A detailed Monte Carlo of the entire hybrid detector should be used to evaluate the accuracy of air shower geometric reconstructions. The detector should achieve the best geometric accuracy by using timing information from all detector elements, both eye pixels and particle counters.

Reference-contexts: Analytic arguments provide an estimate of the expected accuracy of reconstruction without recourse to a full Monte Carlo. The following is one analytic approach. The HiRes (High Resolution Fly's Eye) prototype has demonstrated that an eye can determine a track-eye plane to an accuracy of approximately 0.1 ffi <ref> [20] </ref>. The track-eye plane is that plane which includes the location of the eye and the line of the shower axis. Experimentally, it is the plane through the eye which most nearly contains the pointing directions of phototubes centered on the shower axis.

Reference-contexts: For a track seen by 10 pixels, the uncertainty in t should be less than 0.07 s. The uncertainty in t g depends on the distance of the ground station from the shower core approximately like <ref> [21] </ref> t = 0:0016 (1 + r=0:03) 1:6 s; (12) where r is the distance from the core in km.

Reference-contexts: Although detailed atmospheric monitoring is possible, such precise monitoring would add significant cost to the detector. 3.3 Alternative optical physiologies The first attempt at an atmospheric fluorescence cosmic ray detector used Fresnel lenses rather than mirrors. That was the "cosmic house" built by Greisen and graduate students at Cornell <ref> [24] </ref>. They failed to measure cosmic ray air showers. The atmospheric fluorescence technique was successfully implemented in the Utah Fly's Eye using mirrors to focus the light. 18 Like the Fly's Eye, the HiRes detector also uses clusters of phototubes at the foci of mirrors.

Reference-contexts: In principle, however, other light focusing methods can be used instead of mirrors. Nocturnal insects and crustaceans have evolved eyes <ref> [25] </ref> which may be more efficient than the compound fly's eye in collecting dim light signals. In those animals, there is a hemispheric surface which collects the light and focuses it onto an inner hemispheric retina.

Reference-contexts: The light focusing is achieved by reflecting the tangential component of each light ray at the outer hemisphere while preserving its radial component. A "moth's eye" (nocturnal insect eye) can be made using lenses to reflect the tangential directions. J. Elbert studied in some detail <ref> [26] </ref> the feasibility of such a design, making the outer hemisphere from a mosaic of 3-layer Fresnel lenses. Numerical simulations showed the optical properties to be completely satisfactory for a fluorescence detector of cosmic ray air showers.

Reference-contexts: The phototubes were arranged on a hemisphere of approximately half that radius. A lobster eye uses reflecting tubes of square cross section, arranged on the outer hemisphere with the tube axes aligned radially <ref> [27] </ref>. Reflecting the tangential component of a light ray requires it to reflect off two adjacent walls.
