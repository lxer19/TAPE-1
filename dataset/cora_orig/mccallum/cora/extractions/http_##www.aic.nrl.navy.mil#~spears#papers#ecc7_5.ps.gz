Abstract: This article considers novel methods for evolving species in a standard generational evolutionary algorithm. Unlike other methods, these methods replace the concept of distance between individuals with tag bits that identify the species to which an individual belongs. In a traditional generational evolutionary algorithm (EA), N individuals reproduce according to their fitness (given by some objective function) and create a set of N offspring via the application of genetic operators. The N parents are then replaced by the N offspring to produce the next generation. One method for evolving species in a generational EA is through the use of sharing and restricted mating. With sharing, the similarity of individuals within the population is used to dynamically modify the fitness of those individuals. This dynamic modification is internal to the EA, thus what is changing is the EA's perception of the objective function, not the objective function itself. The intuition is simple apeak in the space is treated as resource that a species can exploit. Thus individuals near one peak (forming a species) have to share the resource of that peak. Overcrowding on one peak implies that a resource is overused (there are too many individuals of that species). In this case the perceived fitness of the peak goes down, reducing selective pressure in that area of the space. On the other hand, peaks with few individuals have their perceived fitness increased, increasing selective pressure in those areas. The net effect is to apportion individuals in rough proportion to the relative height of the peaks in the space. Furthermore, the similarity metric is also used to restrict mating (recombination) to those individuals that are most similar. Although sharing and restricted mating are rather general ideas, the implementation of those ideas that has received the most attention is by Goldberg and Richardson (1987). In their implementation, sharing and restricted mating together work very well, creating stable species on many peaks within the search space. Furthermore higher peaks get more individuals than lower peaks, in rough proportion to the relative heights of the peaks, as we would expect with the sharing mechanism. Goldberg's implementation makes two assumptions. The first is the number of peaks in the space. The second is that those peaks are uniformly distributed throughout the space. However, no sensitivity study indicates how well these assumptions must be met. Finally, the implementation (as described by Goldberg and Richardson (1987)) is also expensive. The similarity of each pair of individuals is measured, resulting in O(N 2 ) similarity comparisons. An alternative to the use of a similarity (distance) metric is to use "labels" to help identify individuals. The motivation for this alternative comes from nature. For example, this author does not decide he is Portuguese because he is in some sense similar to a few of his cousins. Rather, he decides he is Portuguese because his ancestors were labeled as Portuguese. Although this does not mean that one genetically inherits such "labels", they certainly can be culturally inherited. What if each EA individual has a label? Similarity then becomes simply a matter of seeing if two individuals have the same label. Of course, this implies that everyone with the same label is equally similar. The results of Spears (1994) suggest that the added precision of the distance metric is often not needed.
