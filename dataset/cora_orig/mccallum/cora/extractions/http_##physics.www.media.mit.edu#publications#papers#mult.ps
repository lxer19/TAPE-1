Abstract: We have developed a novel input device called the "Flying Fish", which uses Electric Field (EF) sensing. We describe the basic physical principles of EF sensing, and show how it provides a simple, cheap mechanism for using hand gestures to navigate through virtual spaces, without the need for wearing or holding anything. We also discuss the implications of this type of device for interface designers, introducing the concept of "invisible metaphors", and illustrating its role in making interactions with 3D virtual worlds feel natural.

Reference-contexts: As we discuss in the following section, we have found that the most natural use for the Flying Fish is as a controller for 3D navigation. We note here, however, that the device is "extensible" in the sense discussed in Brown et al <ref> [BBM90] </ref>, since it could implement a number of different virtual devices like a virtual 3D tablet or virtual 3D mouse by using different functional mappings from sensor values to control values.

Reference-contexts: But there is an entirely different naturally occurring sense modality which humans do not have, but which can be used to directly sense the presence of human bodies or body parts. Weakly electric fish are extremely good at sensing electric fields <ref> [Bul82] </ref>. Some, like sharks and catfish, just passively sense the presence of electric fields, but others such as the Gymnotiformes also generate their own fields, and detect changes in these fields induced by the presence of objects in the water around them. <p> As EF sensing devices begin to proliferate, there may be a multitude of small EF sensing devices scattered about in a single room. The jamming avoidance mechanism of weakly electric fish <ref> [Bul82] </ref> suggests that such devices can communicate with each other and adjust their transmission frequencies autonomously when new devices are introduced into the sensing space.

Reference-contexts: Electric field sensing for human-computer interfaces is generally possible in a frequency range of 10 kHz to 1MHz. Below this range, displacement currents and update rates are too small. Above this range FCC power regulations become more stringent <ref> [Com95] </ref>. At our operating frequencies, the amount of field that users are exposed to is about the equivalent that one gets from wearing stereo headphones, which is several orders of magnitude below FCC limits.

He used two omnidirectional antennas to control the pitch and amplitude of an oscillator. A hand or other body part brought near an antenna introduces additional capacitance to ground which detunes a resonant tank circuit (see figure 1).

Reference-contexts: We wanted to measure the position of the bow to Yo-Yo Ma's cello in two axes with minimum impact on the instrument and its playability <ref> [Ger93] </ref>. As a result of a side-effect that occurred during this project we discovered that it was possible to create a directed electric field and use it to make measurements of human hand position. (voltage) is created between an oscillator electrode and a virtual ground electrode.

Reference-contexts: We are working on the continuum limit of adding more dipoles, to perform low-resolution imaging [Smi95]. 2.3 Human Transmitter Mode During our experiments with a variety of applications we also discovered that it is possible to sense fields in another mode <ref> [GZA95] </ref>. Here a person can stand on, sit on, touch, or otherwise be near the oscillating transmit electrode. This capacitively couples low frequency energy is into the person's body, making the entire person an EF emitter (figure 3). One or more receiver electrodes can then be placed around the person. <p> Others are described in <ref> [GZA95] </ref> and [ZSP + 95].

Reference-contexts: The Fish board supports MIDI, RS-232, and RS-485 serial communication protocols. A synchronous detection circuit (figure 5) is used to detect the transmitted frequency and reject all others <ref> [HH89] </ref>, acting as a very narrow band-pass filter. The displacement current can be measured with approximately 12 bits accuracy (72 dB) using the components shown in figure 5. There is a trade-off between update rate (sample rate/number of samples averaged) and accuracy (signal-to-noise ratio).

Again contrary to the straightforward view of Baudel et al quoted above (4), figures 10 and 11 show that there is more than one way of thinking about the meaning of an upward gesture.
