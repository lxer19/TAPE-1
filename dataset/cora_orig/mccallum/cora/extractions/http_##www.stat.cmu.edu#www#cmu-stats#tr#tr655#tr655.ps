Abstract: Given the presence of a meridional temperature gradient (MTG) across midlati-tudes, large-scale eddies transport heat poleward, thereby shaping Earth's climate. Defining an MTG index here as the difference in surface temperature between the 30 ffi -35 ffi N belt and the 50 ffi -55 ffi N belt, we use a temperature record compiled from observations over a 110-year period to determine a trend in the MTG in the last century. We find a significant decreasing trend in the MTG over this period of 0:4 0:1 ffi C per 100 years, along with indications of substantial multidecadal variability.

Reference-contexts: Generally, tropical temperatures vary by only a few degrees from glacial to interglacial periods, while mid-latitude and polar temperatures vary quite a bit more <ref> (Budyko et al., 1987) </ref>. In addition, one set of climate model simulations suggests a global average surface temperature difference of about 10 ffi C between the last ice age (18 thousand years ago) and the Mesozoic era (65 million years ago).

Reference-contexts: Observations of cyclone frequency over North America show a general reduction of cyclone counts since 1950 <ref> (Changnon, 1995) </ref>. Over the common period of record since 1950, our lowess analysis of the MTG index also indicates a general reduction, although year-to-year correlations with Changnon's North America cyclone counts are not significant.

Reference-contexts: By iterating this process (i.e., by using ^ fi to remove a linear trend from the MTG and then recomputing ^ fi on the residuals), we obtain an approximation to the generalized least squares estimate <ref> (or best linear unbiased estimate, e.g., Cryer, 1986, p.39) </ref> of fi.

Reference-contexts: A weighted least squares line (i.e., with weights proportional to the amount of available data contributing to each MTG observation) is fit and then subtracted from the MTG series. Based on standard ARMA model selection criteria <ref> (for a good summary of these, see Diggle, 1990) </ref>, an appropriate model is chosen for ^ X t = Y t ^ff ^ fit. The autocovariance matrix, V, of the ^ X t s is estimated from the data by using the maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters.

Reference-contexts: Estimates of the regression parameters in (1) are asymptotically independent of the parameter estimates in X t , and so we should not expect the regression parameter estimates to change very much with different models for X t (Pierce, 1971). On the other hand, standard errors may change substantially <ref> (e.g., Greenhouse et al., 1987) </ref>. Because the X t are assumed to be correlated in (1), the identification of a trend is not straightforward. In particular, calculations for the standard error of a trend estimate must somehow account for the correlations in the X t process.

Reference-contexts: The results using these two estimates were quite similar. 5 1970's may be related to the sharp increase in average global surface temperature around the same time <ref> (Hansen and Lebedeff, 1987) </ref> which occurs mostly in the high latitude zone. Figure 2 shows the two zones which make up the MTG (with dashed lowess lines, f = 0:3).

Reference-contexts: This simple picture is complicated by ocean dynamics, however, and some coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models point to a potential increase in the MTG in the Southern Hemisphere due to the strong coupling between surface temperatures and the deep ocean in high southern latitudes <ref> (Held, 1993) </ref>. Strong upwelling from the deep ocean does not take place in the Northern Hemisphere (where localized downwelling is the current norm), and so coupled models continue to simulate decreases in Northern Hemisphere MTG in response to greenhouse forcing. <p> Potential changes in the MTG have been linked with potential changes in storminess in midlatitudes. Decreases in the MTG (ceteris paribus) should lead to weaker midlatitude eddies 4 . This assumes that the decrease in lower tropospheric MTG is more important than the projected increase in upper tropospheric MTG <ref> (Held, 1993) </ref>, and that diminished heat transport between 35 ffi and 55 ffi is more likely to be associated with reduced eddy activity than with reduced mean meridional circulation or ocean circulation (which 3 Note that this constancy in MTG is associated with apparent increases in temperature in both MTG zones

Reference-contexts: To be sure, such excursions are not unprecedented in the paleoclimate record. Other studies of the temperature record have modeled the variation using fractionally-integrated white noise processes <ref> (Hosking, 1981) </ref>, which can help to account for long-range dependence in the data (Bloomfield, 1992; Bloomfield and Nychka, 1992; Smith, 1993). Such models will produce different, and sometimes larger, estimates of the standard error.

Reference-contexts: If changes in temperature are uniform with latitude, then the MTG will be unchanged. If increases in temperature are concentrated at high/low latitudes, the MTG will decrease/increase. Over the entire length of the time series considered here, there has been an increase in observed T <ref> (Jones et al., 1986a,b) </ref>, while herein we have observed a decrease in MTG. This relationship is more complicated, however, at higher (multi-decadal scale) frequencies.

Reference-contexts: Differential solar heating between equator and poles sets up a temperature imbalance, giving rise to atmospheric motions which, in turn, modify the temperature gradient by transporting heat polewards <ref> (Stone, 1984) </ref>. Thus the MTG is maintained as a balance between the equator-pole heating gradient and the fluxes of heat which are transported by atmospheric eddies and the mean meridional circulation (and ocean currents). In midlatitudes eddies are the primary means of poleward heat transport (Stone, 1984). <p> gradient by transporting heat polewards <ref> (Stone, 1984) </ref>.
