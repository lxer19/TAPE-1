Abstract: Database query is becoming a common task in public access systems; touchscreens can provide an appealing interface for such a system. This paper explores three interfaces for constructing queries on alphabetic field values with a touchscreen interface; including a QWER TY keyboard, an Alphabetic keyboard, and a Reduced Input Data Entry (RIDE) interface. The RIDE interface allows field values to be entered with fewer keystrokes (touches) than either keyboard while eliminating certain errors. In one test database, the RIDE interface required 69% fewer keystrokes than either keyboard interface.

Reference-contexts: The first is that inexperienced users must search the keyboard for the appropriate key , the location of a key is unpredictable. Novices are forced to search the keyboard to locate each key as they need it <ref> (Nicolson & Gardner, 1985) </ref>. In addition, a QWER TY keyboard interface does not prevent misspellings or inappropriate values from being entered. Issues that must be addressed when using a QWER TY keyboard layout include color and size coding of keys.

Reference-contexts: Touchscreens allow the definition of selectable regions to act as keys. T ouchscreen interfaces can be customized at each stage of the interaction; when a key becomes unnecessary it can simply be removed from the interface, eliminating the possibility of an inappropriate selection of that key <ref> (Priest & Pfauth, 1981) </ref>. Keys on a keyboard can be inactivated, however users may still press the key expecting some response. Touchscreens allow a natural method for selecting items from the screen (Shneiderman, 1987). Users simply point to an item on the screen, and it is selected. <p> This requires additional cognitive effort from users and may result in higher error rates and slower performance. The rapid selection and ease of use of touchscreens often result in high user satisfaction. Other benefits include a minimal learning time and the guidance a touchscreen system can provide <ref> (Priest & Pfauth, 1981) </ref>. However, most touchscreens allow only a single touch at a time, making resting your hand or fingers on the screen impossible. This may have significant implications on tasks that involve typing or precise selections. Touchscreen interfaces can be customized easily for the specific type of interaction.

Reference-contexts: Some solutions explored the use of alternate selection strategies (Potter, Weldon & Shneiderman, 1988; Potter, Berman & Shneiderman, 1989; Murphy , 1986). A more recent attempt involved smoothing the data received from the touchscreen to compensate for the lack of stability in hardware <ref> (Sears & Shneiderman, 1989) </ref>. Arm fatigue was reduced and difficulties with the reading angle were resolved in a study by W eisner (1988). W eisner allowed users to pivot the monitor to the angle they preferred.

Reference-contexts: Keys on a keyboard can be inactivated, however users may still press the key expecting some response. Touchscreens allow a natural method for selecting items from the screen <ref> (Shneiderman, 1987) </ref>. Users simply point to an item on the screen, and it is selected. Unlike 2 touchscreens, keyboards require items on the screen to be mapped into sequences of key-presses. This requires additional cognitive effort from users and may result in higher error rates and slower performance.

Reference-contexts: field name that is not valid (either not in the database or just misspelled), select an operator that is not applicable at that point in the query, or type a value for a field that is misspelled or inappropriate such as a number when a person s name is required <ref> (Welty, 1985) </ref>. Touchscreen interfaces are becoming more common for public access systems. The reasons for this success include rapid performance, ease of learning, lack of moving parts, and durability (Pickering, 1986; Shneiderman, 1987; Stone, 1987; Muratore, 1987; Priest & Pfauth, 1981).
