Abstract: When managing complex systems, cognitive demands or problem-solving situations can appear in different ways. In some situations, problems surface gradually while being recognised, identified and treated. This category of situations has been labelled as `going sour' incidents. Within these incidents, there are a number of interesting and unique features warranting special attention. The present research project attempts to depict the the task demands associated with going sour incidents. After initial analysis of complexity and some field observations, initial hypotheses were generated. Subsequent field study has provided support for the hypotheses. Major findings on going sour incidentsinclude: 1 problem-solving spans a long period of time and requires synthesis of information over this period; 2 trouble spots have to be checked repeatedly as the environment is likely to change over time; 3 interventions are required before obtaining sufficient number of signs; and 4 multiple hypotheses must be maintained and examined as the underlying problem changes appearance slowly from one form to another.
