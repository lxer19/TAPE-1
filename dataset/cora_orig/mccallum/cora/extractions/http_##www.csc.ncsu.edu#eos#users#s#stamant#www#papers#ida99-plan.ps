Abstract: In mixed-initiative planning, a human planner collaborates with an automated system to build a plan of action. In existing approaches, the participants incrementally add constraints or modifications to a single plan structure until an acceptable solution is found. We propose instead to treat the process as a form of data exploration, in which sets of plans and their relationships are the objects of interest, rather than an individual abstract plan. The system assists the human planner in this process by autonomously constructing simple statistical descriptions of patterns in sets of plans. Its analysis is supported by heuristic knowledge about the physics of a planning environment, knowledge that contributes to a limited form of strategic statistical reasoning.

Reference-contexts: In the best case, the user can delegate the details of a task to the automated system without giving up the ability to guide and review the decision-making process. James Allen <ref> [1] </ref> distinguishes mixed-initiative planning from conventional planning by three characteristics: mixed-initiative planners allow problem-solving initiative to change hands flexibly and opportunistically between the user and the system; they are able to shift focus of attention to meet changes in user needs; they contain mechanisms for maintaining shared, implicit knowledge.

Clasp gives interactive and programmatic access to a variety of statistical tools: graphical displays, data manipulation operations, model-fitting algorithms, and statistical tests. Aide, a descendant of Clasp, is an assistant for intelligent data exploration [23, 24].

Reference-contexts: The difficulty in mixed-initiative planning lies in formalizing and managing an interactive, cognitively intensive process in which control is shared between the participants. Researchers have attacked the problem from different perspectives, treating the human-computer interaction as a peer-to-peer dialog [8, 9], as a type of visual programming <ref> [4] </ref>, as an advice-exchanging relationship [17], and as a navigation problem [22, 24], among other possibilities. These approaches to mixed-initiative planning all share a common theme.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In mixed-initiative planning, a human planner and an automated system contribute to a problem solution|formulation, development, analysis, repair|without the need for a constant exchange of explicit instructions <ref> [5] </ref>. The goal is to integrate human judgment into an automated search for solutions to complex problems. The difficulty in mixed-initiative planning lies in formalizing and managing an interactive, cognitively intensive process in which control is shared between the participants. <p> Burstein and McDermott expand on these and related issues in a summary of the state of the art <ref> [5] </ref>. From an IDA perspective, this area gives us problems with large amounts of data, rich structure to be extracted, and complex decisions that depend on our interpretation of the data. Our work builds on two earlier statistical systems, Clasp and Aide.

Reference-contexts: for plans, the user generally views only one plan at a time, considering questions such as "Which actions should the plan contain?" and "How should their execution be constrained?" The planning process moves forward incrementally through local changes to an abstract plan, at a cost very familiar to data analysts <ref> [7] </ref>. We propose to change the terms of the mixed-initiative search to ameliorate this problem. We treat the planning process as a form of data exploration, in which sets of plans and their relationships are the objects of interest, rather than a single abstract plan.

Reference-contexts: The third area we draw on is reasoning about physical relationships. Some researchers in human cognition see a strong relationship between our experiences in interacting with the physical world and our understanding of physical and even entirely abstract concepts <ref> [15] </ref>. This correspondence applies to data analysis as well. Data analysis methods are closely tied to our understanding of the physical world.
