Abstract: An interpolation technique based on Hermite bicubic surfaces is proposed to improve the accuracy of the reconstruction of illumination functions and avoid Mach band artifacts. The information of radiosity at vertices is used to evaluate approximate tangent planes to the illumination function and determine partials and mixed partials of that function. Typical discontinuities of intensity or derivative in the illumination function are preserved in the reconstructed image. The additional computation involved is modest and the result of real importance.

Reference-contexts: That reconstructed or interpolated function is called reconstruction function. As it is too difficult to find an interpolation function for a whole scene, the problem is broken down into small parts. Usually, in radiosity algorithms the objects of the scene are tessellated into geometrical patches [6] <ref> [1] </ref>. For simplicity, the reconstruction function is tessellated into reconstruction patches associated with the geometrical patches of the scene.

Reference-contexts: The main goal is to generate images that evoke the same response that the observer would have when looking at the actual environment. There are many limitations related to physiological cues that hamper the achievement of the final purpose <ref> [3] </ref>. A special limitation is the way our eyes respond to changes and discontinuities in magnitude and/or slope of intensity. This is the so called Mach band effect.

Reference-contexts: Kirk and Voorhies [10] used a quadratic interpolation that avoided Mach band in almost every case, but did not guarantee derivative continuity between adjacent patches. Another quadratic interpolation, described by Powell and Sabin [12] and Cendes and Wong <ref> [5] </ref>, has been used to reconstruct continuously differentiable functions. Although continuity of derivative is desirable to reconstruction functions, care must be taken in some cases where the illumination functions present magnitude and slope discontinuities.

Reference-contexts: The most simple, but expensive, solution of using a finer mesh is not effective, unless all polygons used are smaller than a pixel. This effect of discontinuity is known as Mach band [13] <ref> [8] </ref>, and was first reported in 1865 by the Austrian physicist Ernst Mach.

Reference-contexts: Otherwise, there is no continuity at each edge between two patches (C 1 discontinuous in intensity). To reduce discontinuity problems, a bilinear interpolation technique has been introduced by Gouraud <ref> [9] </ref>. A linear interpolation can ensure continuity of intensity, but cannot eliminate derivative discontinuities (C 0 continuous in intensity, discontinuous in derivative). The discontinuities in intensity and/or in derivative, in places where the illumination function should be smooth, may appear as Mach band effect in the generated images.

Reference-contexts: Using Powell-Sabin quadratic interpolation looks to be difficult to handle derivative discontinuities, because it imposes a strong connection between neighboring patches. Salesin et al. <ref> [14] </ref> proposed a bicubic reconstruction scheme that breaks up each triangular patch into three B ezier subtriangles and introduced discontinuities relaxing constraints on the control points of adjacent triangles. Our approach is similar to the second one, but with a simpler scheme.
