Abstract: Artificial life might come to play important roles for the World Wide Web, both as a source of new algorithmic paradigms and as a source of inspiration for its future development. New Web searching and managing techniques, based on artificial life principles, have been elicited by the striking similarities between the Web and natural environments. New Web interface designs, based on artificial life techniques, have resulted in increased aesthetic appeal, smart animations, and clever interactive rules. In this paper we exemplify these observations by surveying a number of meeting points between artificial life and the Web. We touch on a few implementation issues and attempt to draw some lessons to be learned from these early experiences.

Reference-contexts: A detailed description of the implementation of the InfoSpiders system is out of the scope of this paper. Interested readers can find such details, as well as reports on preliminary experiments, elsewhere [14-16] or on-line <ref> [1] </ref>. Here we limit ourselves to outline the general ideas behind the model. The first step is to identify the crucial resource, the "food" of the artificial environment. For the task at hand, it is easy to equate resources with relevant information.

Reference-contexts: This creates a landscape that agents can explore making use of correlation of relevance across links. Preliminary results, based on theoretical analysis, simulations, and actual experiments on Web-based corpora, are very encouraging <ref> [14] </ref>. It has been shown that link topology can indeed be detected and exploited by distributed agents, outperforming exhaustive search by an order of magnitude.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that link topology can indeed be detected and exploited by distributed agents, outperforming exhaustive search by an order of magnitude. Moreover, the synergy between evolution, learning, and relevance feedback induces an additional, four-fold boost in performance <ref> [15] </ref>. 3 Applications to Web Interface Design Web Interface Design (WID) is drastically changing in its aspect and functionality. Yet it is unclear in what direction it is moving.

Reference-contexts: It also gives a somewhat unexpected behavior, as one of the CA populations suddenly changes color and takes a new pattern. Text Oriented Interactivity WICA animations can be integrated with a Text Oriented Interface (TOI) <ref> [17] </ref> so that they always renew themselves. JcaToi [6], shown in Figure 3, is such an extension of WICA and another example of value-added communication. JcaToi provides the user with an interactive Game of Life implementation that is controlled by free-flowing text.

Reference-contexts: You can also think of 'introducing food' free flowing text into a running simulation, etc. 3.2 Flocking Web Creatures Floys [7] are another example in which ALife issues cross over with Web interface issues. Floys (shown in Figure 4) belong to the flocking ALife creatures variety <ref> [19] </ref>, sharing with them the social tendency to stick together, and the life-like emergent behavior which is based on a few simple, local rules. They differ from most other ALife flocking (boids-type) implementations by being territorial animats that defend their territory against intruders.
