Abstract: Design activities are fundamental to technological progress. Current design research holds tight to positivism, abandoned and critically opposed to by philosophers, mostly those outside the U.S. Maintaining the positivist view when conducting research leads to significant deficiencies in the quality of research, and to problems in transferring research results to practice. In spite of significant research efforts, the improvement of practice is slow. This improvement, in turn, does not necessarily reflects the diffusion of research results into practice, but rather, the development of ideas by practitioners. This paper analyzes this theory-practice problem of technology from practical, cultural, and philosophical perspectives. It proposes a research methodology of design and briefly shows how this methodology can shed light on some problems related to technology. The paper also discusses the fundamental role of design in technology, thereby viewing the research methodology proposed as a methodology for studying some aspects of technology.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, while positivism begun with the explicit aim to generate knowledge that will improve society and human life 25 <ref> (Bacon, 1967) </ref>, later, positivism argued that such subjective issues must be removed from inquiry to enable the generation of knowledge that can improve them. This rendered positivism, the defender of reason and rationality, irrational; in fact, positivism suffer from rationalistic neurosis (Maxwell, 1984).

Reference-contexts: This dialogue is the I-It relation of Buber. In the third type, a new concept emerges: the Thou, leading to the I-Thou relationships. This relationship is of different ontological significance than the I-It relation <ref> (Bergman, 1991) </ref>. The genuine dialogue|the I-Thou relationship|requires a commitment to an effortful process. The essence of dialogue is the seeking for something new, therefore, one must actively be open to accept new ideas. <p> A dialogue requires an active facilitation of the above conditions; one must be strong to resist the tendency to reduce effort, take a leisure attitude toward the world (of It), which do not demand the I-Thou tension <ref> (Bergman, 1991) </ref>. <p> This, however, is different from Buber's existentialist ontology. 28 the I-Thou relationship. The practice of theory is a technical dialogue. Its result is science that being an abstraction of the world fails to perceive the real world <ref> (Bergman, 1991) </ref>. According to Buber, knowledge grows from alternate action and reflection, participation and distance, balance between unity and parity. No synthesis, as in the synthesis of thesis and antithesis of Hegel dialectic, is assumed. Rather the tension between these poles maintains both existence. <p> The fourth interpretation relies on Buber's notion of a dialogue. A true dialogue emerges when both relations: embodiment and hermeneutic exists. Through the dialogue, a unity emerges that maintains the duality of the participants <ref> (Bergman, 1991) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: As such, it can be critical when used to reconstruct actual history and be explanatory when it reconstructs the choices (created through some consensus building) made throughout history by various cultures. In contrast to his earlier work, the theory does not provide a therapeutic explanation <ref> (Braaten, 1991) </ref>. The communicative theory encompass not only the linguistic competence of Chomsky, but also aspects of the linguistic performance or communication competence. In fact, the theory must be capable of accounting for actual communication.

Reference-contexts: This question relates to the mind-body problem and although technology demonstrates its manifestation, it does not explain its possibility. The possibility of practical reason is predicated on the concept of dialogue <ref> (Bubner, 1988) </ref>. One can identify at least two types of dialogues: one aiming at understanding, and another aiming at practical action. Socrates' dialogues were of the first type: they demonstrated that possessing true knowledge or understanding involve more than an exchange of words.

In light of this argument, a call for a new liberal art of design <ref> (Buchanan, 1992) </ref>, is likely to receive no more attention by engineering schools than did Simon's ideas. 14 There are additional causes maintaining the gap between theory and practice.

The volume edited by Sanoff (1978) went further than discussing the participation process from the designer standpoint by providing potential participating communities with information about design knowledge and participation. The situation in engineering design is more complex than the one in urban design.

Design science, will culminate as a host of theories that are derived by the scientific method, can explain and predict phenomena, and can control and manipulate situations (including humans within these situations).

I propose that a crucial question to be addressed is how technology affects human ability to participate in a genuine dialogue. Bergman (1991) clearly interpreted Buber on this subject.

Reference-contexts: It should not be surprising to find such a circular dependency. Technology constantly changes the environment, we find ourselves experiencing new sensations and adapt to new circumstances. Therefore, technology necessarily engages us in self-creation <ref> (Feibleman, 1982) </ref> that constantly circles through design, experience, and adaptation activities. Buber's dialogue is a whole that addresses at least three of the core concerns of technology.

Reference-contexts: I will not try to defend this hypothesis; instead, I will use it for explaining other concepts while mentioning that others have articulated ideas about the generality of design as a human activity (Petroski, 1992), its epistemological values (Perkins, 1986), its ontological consequences (Hickman, 1990), and its existential meaning <ref> (Florman, 1976) </ref>.

All these participants engage in design. As philosophers we design arguments against and in favor of specific positions. <p> At that time dialogue appeared to me." (Buber (1964), p. 47) The designer engages in a practice by creating designs. If the designer is fortunate, he or she enjoys this creative experience independent of its outcome; this experience is existential <ref> (Florman, 1976) </ref>. Unfortunately, this experience is not free; the designer is forced to produce marketable artifacts that will maintain his or her job. Therefore, the designer turn to design "practical" artifacts.

I can be mistaken in the design hypothesis or in any of its consequences since none of its interpretations can be proved. On the other hand, they cannot be disproved.

Reference-contexts: Not only the concepts of inquiry are not fixed but neither epistemology nor methodology is "about the nature of truth, but rather involves the study of the social practices by which communities develop a basis for warranted belief and action." <ref> (Giarelli, 1988, p. 26, cited by Schwandt, 1990) </ref> Similar ideas about the evolutionary nature and meaning of concepts such as induction, theory, hypothesis, empirical testing, epistemology, methodology, etc. were discussed by many others philosophers (Habermas, 1971; Peirce, 1955; Rorty, 1979).

And moreover, these three ingredients are intertwined with cultural background and political interests which are often neglected. For example, if design researchers adopted the positivist view (as most do), they would have, as Guba (1990) contended, subscribed to a realist ontology, objectivist epistemology, and controlled experiments as methodology. <p> Education Some education researchers dealing with evaluating educational programs and their improvements have recognized the flaws in the positivist paradigm 5 of inquiry, and proposed to replace it by contemporary paradigms such as postpositivism, critical theory, and constructivism <ref> (Guba, 1990) </ref>. Some researchers may view these paradigms as competing, but Guba, having a pluralist view, proposed a dialogue between the paradigms without the intention to identify one as the best, but with the hope that better paradigms will emerge. party from 1933 to 1945.

I will illustrate these and two more important interpretations as they apply for all human participants in the process of technological change, concentrating on design as the fundamental activity underlying technology. <p> The mind-body distinction has been prevalent in many cultures, since ancient times (McDougall, 1961); and has another analogue beside the TPP, namely, the relation between science and technology <ref> (Ihde, 1979) </ref>.

While the interactionist view easily applies to all, the materialist mind-body view of most positivist scientists <ref> (Ihde, 1979) </ref> contradicts the idealistic view of science that they practice. In fact, for some researchers, the idealistic view of science allows ignoring the impact of the "value-free knowledge" they generate, while their research is sponsored by agencies for the materialistic purpose of developing unethical technologies. <p> The consumer, the last link in the technological chain, is the one that actually probes the world with the products of theories developed by remote participants in technological developments. 23 The consumer's experiences with the world can be divided into two classes of relations <ref> (Ihde, 1979) </ref>: embodiment, manifested in acts such as driving a car that is well designed, or hermeneutic, manifested in acts such as driving a car badly designed. The first relation allows experiencing the world, without paying attention to the product used. the product becomes a transparent extension of the customer. <p> Their problem may be the result of using the wrong ontology: Heidegger's notion of being as a human's monologue, instead of Buber's notion of existence as a dialogue between a person and its world. 32 Philosophers may explore the technological world via phenomenological exercises <ref> (Ihde, 1979) </ref> or other methods. Usually, their exercises will be simple or limited by current technology. Philosophers can extend their experiences by analyzing imagery situations such as those stemming from science fiction, of which Orwell's 1984 is a good example. <p> questions? The ethical question concerns basic studies on the personal and social impacts of technology (Bender, 1987; Brown, 1971; Mitcham and Mackey, 1972) and also addresses new ethical problems emerging from technological progress, such as the need to reformulate life or death issues in light of new life saving devices <ref> (Ihde, 1979) </ref>, or the need to study the issue of professional ethics in various disciplines (Durbin, 1987). I propose that a crucial question to be addressed is how technology affects human ability to participate in a genuine dialogue. Bergman (1991) clearly interpreted Buber on this subject.

But in spite of the evidence against positivism, the research community, mostly remote from such criticisms and debates, thinks it is practicing theory, while in fact it is practicing a mix of theoria and praxis, and as I said previously, in an irrational manner.

Aristotle viewed both phronesis and techne as preconditions of the life of human organizations, but such that could not be derived or justified by theory <ref> (McCarthy, 1978) </ref>. Both three metaphysical categories of knowledge contained a theory and practical aspects and were 24 in fact ways of living (in addition to the fourth way of those hard laborers at the bottom of the social structure) (Hickman, 1990). <p> While the industrial revolution was the result of techne, the view of technology as applied science was since strengthened, even though engineers occasionally criticized this view (Vincenti, 1984). This trend pushed the theoria sphere into the praxis sphere and made the praxis sphere to be simple techne <ref> (McCarthy, 1978) </ref>. It is the aim of this study to try and recover praxis from its current position; furthermore the growing complexity of artifacts built today and their dependence on social processes make praxis more crucial to design than techne.

Reference-contexts: The mind-body problem The TPP is one of the dualities that can be associated with the mind-body distinction since theory originates in the mind and practice is the action of the body. The mind-body distinction has been prevalent in many cultures, since ancient times <ref> (McDougall, 1961) </ref>; and has another analogue beside the TPP, namely, the relation between science and technology (Ihde, 1979). There are at least four alternatives for viewing the mind-body problem (Ihde, 1979; Levinson, 1988). (1) Identity: Mind and body are two manifestation of the same thing.

No assumption about the general applicability of information recorded (which some may call knowledge) is made. The evolutionary nature of design is evident.

In fact, technology is a manifestation of ideas in material or material embodiment of ideas. It therefore refutes the strictly materialistic or idealistic views. Moreover, it represents a continuous interaction between the mind and the body.

Design science, will culminate as a host of theories that are derived by the scientific method, can explain and predict phenomena, and can control and manipulate situations (including humans within these situations). <p> The practitioner will respond to potential interaction from the theoretician by saying "while I do not accept your view of knowledge, I cannot describe my own."
