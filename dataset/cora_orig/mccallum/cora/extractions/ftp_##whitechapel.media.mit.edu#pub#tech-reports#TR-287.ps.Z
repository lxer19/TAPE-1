Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 287 Appears in: Proc. of the Fifth Eurographics Workshop on Anim. and Sim., Oslo, Norway, Sept 1994 Abstract We present a new technique for fire synthesis which combines a model for flames with a model for flame spreading. For the flame model, we show that minor changes to traditional particle system techniques exhibit significant improvements in realism, with little to no extra rendering costs. For flame spreading, we model physically-based evolution of the boundary between burning and non-burning regions of polygonally defined objects. Experiments which combine the flame synthesis and spread models are illustrated on polygonally-defined objects. The resulting new technique provides parameters for explicitly controlling wind or gravity, while simultaneously incorporating properties such as the geometry and flammability of the object being burned. Through the use of these parameters, the resulting fire can interact more naturally with the material it is burning, as well as with the surrounding environment.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this level of physically-based volume rendering is expensive and no clear methods for animation or extending the approach to large fires have been presented. A recent work by Chiba, et al. <ref> [2] </ref> presents a powerful way of modeling vortex-based winds for shaping flames and smoke, as well as an innovative model-as-fuel form of fire spread. <p> as from the examples set by the spread modelling community who succeed in accurately modeling spread without treatment of combustion [19] (also [3]). 3.1 Flame Model: an enhanced particle system The flames are modeled using a modified particle system technique (other attempts of the same include [15], [9], [17], and <ref> [2] </ref>). Minor adjustments to the shape and color of a rendered particle eliminate the pointillistic problems mentioned above. Additionally, particle systems do not carry the high computational cost associated with volume rendering a lattice. <p> This force field is the three-dimensional wind field ~u 1 (~p; t) in which the flames exist. Note that the wind model presented here is one of many that could be used; there is a range of wind models (such as the innovative technique described in <ref> [2] </ref>) that could be easily substituted. <p> In our implementation, the control points are stored in a linked list. Note the differences between this implementation of spreading and that in <ref> [2] </ref>. Their method creates a "fuel" lattice that contains all possible locations where fires can spread. To minimize any spatial aliasing, the number of lattice sites N along a dimension would be quite large. <p> In addition to the extra resources needed to maintain this lattice, the form of conduction they present is O (N d ) where d is the number of dimensions in which the fires spread (two were used in <ref> [2] </ref>). The technique presented here spreads fire on the polygons already used for modeling, thus requiring little extra resources for efficient, three-dimensional spread.

Reference-contexts: This "bi-partite" hypothesis comes as much from a desire for simplicity (Occam's razor) as from the examples set by the spread modelling community who succeed in accurately modeling spread without treatment of combustion [19] (also <ref> [3] </ref>). 3.1 Flame Model: an enhanced particle system The flames are modeled using a modified particle system technique (other attempts of the same include [15], [9], [17], and [2]). Minor adjustments to the shape and color of a rendered particle eliminate the pointillistic problems mentioned above. <p> A given mode of heat transfer has been shown to dominate each of the four categories of spread (these being concurrent and opposed flow on both thermally thin and thick fuels, see [19] and <ref> [3] </ref>). Since a given fire could contain a combination of these, they will all be described. Opposed flow over thermally thin fuels Opposed flow over thermally thin fuels is dominated by heat conduction through the gas.

Reference-contexts: Informally, it tells us that in order to determine the spread rate v s , we must know the form of the heat flux rate, q. The true form of q is complicated and difficult to solve <ref> [4] </ref>; however, the experimental results from the community studying flame spread can aid in approximating it. They have identified three modes of heat transfer which are dominant among all the contributions to q. Before describing these modes in detail it is necessary to describe the different regimes of spread.

Reference-contexts: Figure 8 shows the segments which must be tested for two arbitrary control points to properly prevent double burning. We have used the three-dimensional segment intersection algorithm described in <ref> [6] </ref>. The evolution of the spreading boundary can be visualized by drawing a connected line or curve between the control points.

Reference-contexts: Additional drawbacks to this noise-based, procedural approach become apparent when the fire is to be placed into a larger scene, for external effects such as wind and spread over objects are difficult to treat when the fires are abstracted from the world in this fashion. Inakage <ref> [7] </ref> has taken a more physical look at the processes that form real flames. Combining a model for the emission and transmission of light in the regions near combustion with volume rendering techniques, he has rendered convincing examples of both diffusion (candle) and pre-mixed (Bunsen burner) flames.

Reference-contexts: Nonetheless, even thousands of particles could not hide the discrete nature of the technique. The flames were unnaturally pointillistic as a result. Perlin <ref> [11] </ref> presented a noise-based approach to flame modeling. He formed a fractal approximation to turbulence which he then used to perturb the index into a physically-inspired color/temperature ramp. Traversing through the space of the turbulence function to create upwards motion yielded convincing two-dimensional flames. <p> Note that if k g = 0 and ~w (~p; t) = 0, the flames will not take any shape - equivalent to the zero gravity case. 5 like Perlin's noise function from <ref> [11] </ref>, thus this flame model is a hybrid of noise-based and particle techniques. 6 a value that gives pleasing motions is 0.04 3 ~ N (~p; t) is indicated as a function of time and position to represent the standard technique of animating by "moving through the noise field" in time.

Traversing through the space of the turbulence function to create upwards motion yielded convincing two-dimensional flames. He extended this work in 1989 <ref> [12] </ref> to three dimensions, but the already computationally-intensive process became even more burdened by the additional work needed to render volumes.
