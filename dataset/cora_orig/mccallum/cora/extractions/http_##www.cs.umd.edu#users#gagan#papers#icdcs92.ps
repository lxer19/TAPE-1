Abstract: In distributed systems, data can be replicated to improve availability and performance. Many algorithms have been proposed to coordinate access to replicated data. Most of these algorithms require that the site initiating an operation on replicated data must communicate with all the other sites in the system. This results in high communication overheads. We propose a voting protocol, which can reduce the communication costs significantly. In the proposed scheme, the nodes are arranged in small intersecting groups, such that a site, in absence of failures, needs to communicate only with members of its group to collect the quorum. We suggest a method for constructing such logical groups and show that the message overhead of any operation in a system of N nodes is O( N), when there are no or few failures in the system. We compare the availability and the communication overheads of our protocol with those of the existing ones. p

Reference-contexts: Some extensions of the voting algorithm have been proposed to reduce the communication costs <ref> [1, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15] </ref> In this work we present a protocol in which an operation requires only O ( p N ) messages (where N is the number of nodes in the system) in absence of failures. <p> If even one of the nodes in a group is down, the operation may not proceed. No effort has yet been made to evaluate the availability offered by this approach. In the tree based protocol <ref> [1] </ref>, the nodes are logically arranged in a binary tree. A group of nodes forming a path from root to any leaf forms a quorum. In case any node in the path fails, it is replaced by two paths starting from the two children of the failed node.

Reference-contexts: Some extensions of the voting algorithm have been proposed to reduce the communication costs <ref> [1, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15] </ref> In this work we present a protocol in which an operation requires only O ( p N ) messages (where N is the number of nodes in the system) in absence of failures. <p> The physical nodes are at the lowest level of hierarchy and the group at the highest level needs to be available for any operation to proceed. This approach reduces the message overhead only to O (N :63 ). The grid protocol <ref> [6] </ref> arranges the set of nodes in a rectangular grid. At least one node from each column is required for a read quorum. All nodes of any column and a read quorum constitute a write quorum in this approach. 3 System Model We consider a distributed system with N nodes.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In a distributed system, data can be replicated to provide fault-tolerance against site failures and network partitions and to improve performance. This data replication requires a replica control algorithm to maintain consistency of the data. A survey of such methods can be seen in <ref> [7] </ref>. One such method for replica control is the weighted voting scheme suggested by Gifford [9]. In this algorithm, each node is assigned a number of votes.

Reference-contexts: All nodes of any column and a read quorum constitute a write quorum in this approach. 3 System Model We consider a distributed system with N nodes. Each data-item is replicated at each of these N nodes. We assume that the nodes fail only by stopping <ref> [20] </ref>. We assume that atomicity of transactions is maintained and each site executes its own local concur-rency control mechanism. We also assume that most of the site failures can be detected by other sites as being different from a network partition.
