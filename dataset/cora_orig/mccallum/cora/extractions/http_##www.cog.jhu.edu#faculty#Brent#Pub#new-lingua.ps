Abstract: How could children possibly acquire their first subcategorization frames? The hypothesis that they directly observe the syntactic structures of the utterances they hear raises two questions. First, how can children parse input utterances reliably without already knowing the syntactic properties of the all words in them? Second, how do children survive the ungrammatical or misconstrued utterances they inevitably encounter? This paper suggests a specific inference algorithm that substantially reduces the effects of ungrammatical or misconstrued input. Since children must have some such inference procedure, they could use approximate cues to determine syntactic structure. In particular, they can use string-local surface cues rather than global constraints. Such cues make it possible to discover relevant syntactic structure in an utterance without already knowing all the words in it. This paper also suggests a possible set of cues for English subcategorization frames that assumes only the ability to detect the ends of utterances and knowledge of a few function morphemes and proper names. Simulation experiments on naturally occurring, child-directed English show that these cues, combined with the proposed

Reference-contexts: Although purpose adjuncts can be easily diagnosed in most cases, it is worth noting that there are no satisfactory, necessary and sufficient conditions for distinguishing between arguments and adjuncts in general <ref> (Adams and Macfarland, 1991) </ref>. 3.3 Robust Inference Children hear ungrammatical utterances and probably misconstrue some grammatical utterances, but these aberrations appear to have no impact on their ultimate grammars. This would not be possible if they drew irrevocable conclusions on the basis of single observations.

Reference-contexts: The utterances were taken from the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 1991). The particular transcripts were as follows: all of Bates's free play and snack transcripts, but not the reading aloud transcripts <ref> (Bates et al., 1988) </ref>; all of the Bernstein-Ratner transcripts (Bernstein-Ratner, 1987); all of the Higginson transcripts taken between ages 1;0 and 2;6 (Higginson, 1985); and the Warren-Leubecker (Warren-Leubecker and Bohannon, 1984) transcripts taken before age 2;6. In all cases exactly one adult and one child were present throughout.

Reference-contexts: Subcategorization frames can be read directly off the deep structure, so assuming such inputs is tantamount to assuming away the problem under investigation here. Closer contact with the input makes it natural to test models of this kind by computer simulation on naturally occurring input <ref> (Bever 1991) </ref>. This paper reports on a simulation using transcripts of the child-directed English from the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 1991).

Reference-contexts: Nonetheless, the -ing suffix seems a precarious basis on which to identify mental state verbs | children's true strategies for identifying verbs are doubtless more complex. One possibility is that they use more complex function-morpheme cues that exploit other inflections, auxiliaries, modals, and pronoun case <ref> (Brent, 1991) </ref>. Since these cues are not without exceptions, it would make sense to posit statistical inference mechanism for lexical category cues as well as for subcategorization cues.

Reference-contexts: This directly refutes the ignorance hypothesis. The direct evidence that children are sensitive to the presence and correct usage of function morphemes is summarized below: 1. On imitation tasks, young children (age 1;11-2;6, MLU 1.30-2.00, M = 1:73) omit English function morphemes more often than unstressed nonsense syllables <ref> (Gerken et al., 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: PT: mean age 2;3, MLU 1.07-1.66). The effect persists when function morphemes are replaced by others of the wrong category, as in fl"Find was bird for me," where was is substituted for a determiner <ref> (Gerken and McIntosh, 1993) </ref> (least mature group, MLU &lt; 1:50, M = 1:15, produced no articles during session.) This indicates that two-year-olds who almost never use function morphemes can nevertheless distinguish their syntactic privileges.

Reference-contexts: It has been further proposed that children's putative ignorance of function morphemes results from a perceptual failure | they do not hear or cannot distinguish function morphemes in most languages because they are unstressed <ref> (Gleitman et al., 1988) </ref>. However, a substantial body of convergent evidence has accumulated against each of these hypotheses. Briefly, it has been shown that: 8 1. Even infants can distinguish unstressed syllables as well as stressed syllables (Jusczyk and Thompson, 1978; Williams and Bush, 1978).

Reference-contexts: as having verbal occurrences. (Both have verbal senses, but they do not occur as verbs in the input corpus.) Another possibility is that children understand utterances well enough to recognize that certain words stand for actions or states, and that they have an innate predisposition to classify these as verbs <ref> (Grimshaw, 1981) </ref>. The importance of the statistical inference component can be seen clearly by comparing its input, the raw observations shown in Table 2, with its output, the lexicon shown in Table 5.

Reference-contexts: Such cues are local in the sense that they can be applied without regard to the rest of the sentence, if there is a mechanism for handling the resulting errors. They can also be thought of as surface cues <ref> (Kimball 1973) </ref>. By proposing that children use surface cues, the present model comes closer to contacting 6 the actual input than parameter-setting and learnability models, where it is typically assumed that the input to syntax learning includes bracketed deep structure or surface-structure representations.

Reference-contexts: It has been hypothesized (under the rubric of prosodic bootstrapping) that young children recover a substantial amount of syntactic structure, perhaps even an unlabeled bracketing of all major syntactic constituents, on the basis of prosodic information <ref> (Morgan, 1986) </ref>. Substantiating this hypothesis requires at least establishing that young children attend to prosody and that it is possible to recover syntactic structure from the prosodic properties of sentences without already knowing the language.

Reference-contexts: The function morphemes | prepositions, determiners, inflection, pronouns, auxiliary verbs, and comple-mentizers | are typically the shortest, most common, and most syntactically informative words in a language | ideal starting points for learning syntax <ref> (Morgan, Meier, and Newport 1987, Valian and Coulson, 1988) </ref>. The fact that children do not use function morphemes consistently until quite late has suggested to some that young children do not know them.

Examples include tell, write, fax, inform, warn, advise, and so on. It has been hypothesized that the correlation between subcategorization frames and meanings plays an important role in lexical acquisition.
