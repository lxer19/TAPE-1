Abstract: Precise teleoperation of dextrous robotic hands by hand masters requires an accurate human hand model. A kinematic model of a human index finger is developed as an example for human hand modeling. The parameters of the model are determined by open-loop kinematic calibration. Singular value decomposition is used as a tool for analyzing the kinematic model and the identification process. Accurate and reliable results are obtained only when the numerical condition is minimized through parameter scaling, model reduction and pose set selection. The identified kinematic parameters show the kinematic model and calibration procedure have an accuracy on the order of a few millimeters.

An external measurement system is used to measure the endpoint of the index finger and the measuring instrument's coordinate system (labeled -1 for convenience) is added to the chain of systems used for the finger joints. <p> The resulting endpoint errors are shown in Figure 10. Common measures <ref> [1] </ref> of the model fit are the Variance Accounted For (VAF) and the Root Mean Squared (RMS) error of the endpoint position. The identified parameter values and the measures of model fit are listed in Table 4. A second calibration test is done to demonstrate repeatability.

Reference-contexts: No other kinematic parameter identification method other than external caliper measurement of the finger lengths has yet been used in the dextrous hand teleoperation field. The parameters are poorly identified by the caliper measurement method because of a lack of accurate distinguishable bony landmarks. The biomechanics field <ref> [2, 3, 11, 16] </ref> often makes use of roentenograms, MRI and CT scans for model parameter determination. <p> A study of hand anatomy from a kinematics viewpoint requires analysis of both the skeletal and the capsuloligamentous structure. The hand may be considered <ref> [2] </ref> as a linkage system of intercalated bony segments. These segments define the fingers and palm and allow motion through movement between bone segments. Joint movement is described by the bone segments moving along articulated surfaces. The joints are spanned by soft tissue: ligaments, tendons and muscles. <p> Without the muscles and capsuloligamentous structure defined by the synovial joint capsule and finger ligaments each joint would contain 6 degrees of freedom (DOF). The soft tissue and bony articulation constraints allow the joints to be modeled as Hookean hinge joints <ref> [2, 3, 14] </ref>. model Systems of the Index Finger. Parameters ff i , i , and fi i are omitted for clarity. The PIPJ and DIPJ are modeled as having 1 DOF and the MPJ as 2 DOF. <p> Parameters ff i , i , and fi i are omitted for clarity. The PIPJ and DIPJ are modeled as having 1 DOF and the MPJ as 2 DOF. A hinge joint model is commonly used in hand modeling because it has been shown <ref> [2] </ref> that the inter-joint distances remain fairly constant during flexion/extension. The real finger and the mechanical hinge model are depicted in Figure 3. This paper describes a model of the index finger; the other fingers may be similarly modeled.

Reference-contexts: This paper describes a model of the index finger; the other fingers may be similarly modeled. Following traditional practice of modeling robot kinematics, a series of reference frames are selected for each of the index finger joints. The Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) <ref> [4] </ref> convention is used for the first two frames and a modified convention [5] (referred to hereafter as the Hayati convention) for the next three frames (Figure 4).

Reference-contexts: Parameter scaling is implemented to improve the conditioning by introducing a scaling matrix: e = D ! e = (DH)(H 1 ) where H = diagonal matrix of scaling factors t j The t j scaling values are traditionally chosen by Euclidean norms of the columns of D <ref> [6] </ref>. This method is simple to implement because it requires no a priori statistical information. One drawback to Euclidean norm column scaling is that very large scale factors can arise from small Euclidean norms of poorly identified parameters, resulting in strong amplification of the uncertainties of C [10].

Reference-contexts: For this reason, a pose set was chosen that is simply a typical finger curling/uncurling motion (Figure 8). Simulations of this movement are performed to observe how the condition number depends upon the number of poses. Another good measure of identifi-ability is the observability index O <ref> [7] </ref>: O = 1 2 L m where L is the number of identifiable parameters, and m is the number of poses.
