Reference-contexts: This is the case in most of the published numerical applications of this idea, including clinical trials (Racine et al., 1986), Poisson processes <ref> (Akman and Raftery, 1986) </ref>, change-point problems (Raftery and Akman, 1986) and software reliability (Raftery, 1987, 1988a).

Reference-contexts: In the examples, I will take all the prior odds to be equal to one, corresponding to prior information that is "objective" or "neutral" between competing models <ref> (e.g. Berger, 1985) </ref>, but other prior information about the relative plausibility of competing models can easily be taken into account. The posterior model probabilities given by equation (3) lead directly to solutions of the prediction, decision-making and inference problems that take account of model uncertainty. <p> To obtain the software, send the message "send glib from S" to statlib@stat.cmu.edu. In the examples, I have used normal priors. The literature suggests that the exact prior form is not very important except in extreme cases <ref> (Berger, 1985, p. 151) </ref>, and this is confirmed in the case of generalized linear models by numerical experiments not reported here in detail. This reflects the fact that the prior ordinates in the region where the likelihood is high are more important than the prior probabilities of sets. <p> One step of Newton's method yields the approximation ~ ^ h 00 ( ^ ) 1 h 0 ( ^ ): (26) Now h () = `() + () and so h 00 ( ^ ) (F + G) <ref> (e.g. Berger, 1985, p. 224) </ref>, and h 0 ( ^ ) = ` 0 ( ^ ) + 0 ( ^ ) = 0 ( ^ ).

Reference-contexts: All of these difficulties can be avoided, at least in principle, if one adopts the Bayesian approach of calculating the posterior distribution of a quantity of interest as a weighted average of its posterior distributions under the individual models, weighted by the posterior model probabilities <ref> (Leamer, 1978) </ref>. However, this solution has not yet been widely adopted in practice. This is in part because posterior probabilities for generalized linear models are, in general, unknown and are analytically intractable, although progress has been made in Bayesian estimation for these models (e.g. West, 1985).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Model-building for generalized linear models involves choosing the independent variables, the link function, and the variance function <ref> (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989) </ref>. Each possible combination of choices defines a different model, so that the model-building process consists of comparing many competing models. Strategies for doing this are commonly guided by a series of significance tests, often based on the approximate asymptotic distribution of the deviance. <p> The expected Fisher information matrix is F 1 = 2 X T W X, where W = diagfw 1 ; : : : ; w n g, and w 1 i = g 0 (^ i ) 2 v (^ i ) <ref> (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989) </ref>. Here ^ (1) i = g 1 (x i ^ fi (1) ), where ^ fi (1) is the MLE of fi conditional on M 1 . <p> This is extended to generalized linear models with other link and variance functions by noting that then estimation is equivalent to weighted least squares with the adjusted dependent variable z i = g (^ i ) + (y i ^ i )g 0 (^ i ) and weights w i <ref> (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989) </ref>. The same reasoning leads us again to the prior (17), but where y is replaced by z and all the summary statistics are 8 weighted.

Reference-contexts: The fact that they are slightly data-dependent seems not to be a disadvantage in any practical sense. Also, one fact which can be useful in summarizing the evidence is that B 10 is bounded above as a function of and the bound can easily be calculated <ref> (Raftery, 1988b) </ref>. The use of Bayes factors when prior information is vague has been criticised on the basis of "Bartlett's paradox", namely that B 10 ! 0 as ! 1, regardless of the data (Bartlett, 1957; Gelfand, Dey and Chang, 1992).
