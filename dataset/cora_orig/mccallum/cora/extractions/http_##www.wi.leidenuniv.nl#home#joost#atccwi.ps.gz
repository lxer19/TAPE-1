Abstract: We present an evolutionary tool to solve free-route Air Traffic Flow Management problems within a three-dimensional air space [5]. This is the first evolutionary tool which solves free-route planning problems involving a few hundred aircraft. We observe that the importance of the recombination operator increases as we scale to larger problem instances. The evolutionary algorithm is based on a variant of the elitist recombination algorithm. We show a theoretical analysis of the problem, and present the results of experiments.

Reference-contexts: In order to predict the number of conflicts we can use physical models describing the number of collisions between a set of gas molecules in a box per unit of time <ref> [2] </ref>. When translating such a model to our case we get the following formula, E [#Conf ] = ff t hor d sep v n 2 : Here v is the average velocity. The constant ff is introduced to account for the non-uniform distribution of aircraft over the sector.

Reference-contexts: Within our implementation each offspring competes with only one of its parents. This scheme has a lower selective pressure than the standard elitist recombination scheme. This competition with one parent is also used in the deterministic crowding scheme <ref> [4] </ref>. But deterministic crowding lets offspring compete with the most similar parent.

Reference-contexts: The constant d is chosen such that (M (plan) + R (plan)) =d never becomes larger than one. In this way a fitness f (plan) &gt; 1 corresponds to a conflict free planning. The Elitist recombination algorithm <ref> [6] </ref> is used as a basis for our algorithm. This algorithm does a random pairing of all elements of the population, without using fitness information. Each pair of parents creates two offspring by means of recombination. The best two individuals among parents and offspring are propagated to the next generation.

This system solves problems involving up to 20 aircraft within a square 2D sector of size 200 fi 200 km. Using these problem instances it appeared to be impossible to define a good recombination operator.
