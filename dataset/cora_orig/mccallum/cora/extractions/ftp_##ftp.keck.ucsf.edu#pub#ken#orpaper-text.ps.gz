Abstract: Acknowledgements: I thank M.P. Stryker for encouraging me to take these ideas seriously at an early stage, and him and C. Koch for providing facilities and support. D.J.C. MacKay, B. Mel, E. Niebur, R. Soodak and M.P. Stryker provided useful discussions and, along with the reviewers, helpful comments on the manuscript. B. Chapman, U. Kaplan, D. Mastronarde, M. Meister, L. Palmer, P. Schiller, and R. Wong patiently answered many questions about their experimental results. D. Mastronarde also provided a computer program needed to interpret his results. I was supported at Caltech by a Del Webb Division of Biology Fellowship, and prior to that at UCSF by an N.E.I. Fellowship. Preliminary simulations were done at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, supported by the NSF.

Reference-contexts: In kittens before P14, nearly all oriented cells have been reported to be simple cells in deep layers of cortex (Blakemore and van Sluyters, 1975; Albus and Wolf, 1984), and to be largely or exclusively found in the adult geniculate-recipient layers 4 and 6 <ref> (Albus and Wolf, 1984) </ref> (but see Tsumoto and Suda, 1982). Others report encountering both simple and complex cells in the youngest kittens (Hubel and Wiesel, 1963; Tsumoto and Suda, 1982; Braastad and Heggelund, 1985).

Reference-contexts: In macaque monkeys, the magnocellular-recipient layer 4Cff of striate cortex contains many oriented cells, most of which are simple cells (Blasdel and Fitzpatrick, 1984; Bullier and Henry, 1980). Thus, the present theory may describe the macaque magnocellular pathway. However, the parvocellular-recipient layers 4A and 4Cfi contain non-oriented cells <ref> (Blasdel and Fitzpatrick, 1984) </ref>, and it is unclear whether significant numbers of simple cells form further upstream in the parvocellular pathway (Bullier and Henry, 1980; Hubel, 1982).

Reference-contexts: Across the cortex, cells are initially randomly and poorly oriented (Fig. 7B); hue indicates the preferred orientation of a cell, while brightness indicates the degree of orientation selectivity. The cells gradually develop a continuous and periodic arrangement of preferred orientations that qualitatively resembles that observed experimentally <ref> (Blasdel and Salama, 1986) </ref>. The types of receptive fields and cortical organization that typically emerge are illustrated in Fig. 8. Final results are presented from four simulations that began with identical initial synaptic Place Fig. 8 about here weights but developed under differing parameters. <p> Third, in the monkey and corresponding model map, regions of high orientation gradient ("fractures") tend to run in lines <ref> (Blasdel and Salama, 1986) </ref>, while in the cat and corresponding model map, fractures are largely restricted to points or short lines in the regions of orientation vortices.

Reference-contexts: The anatomical substrate for horizontal synaptic interactions between simple cells within layers 4 and 6 in cat area 17 exists at the appropriate developmental times, as early as the first postnatal week <ref> (Callaway and Katz, 1992) </ref>. However, the substrates for other interactions also exist at this time in cat area 17. The transient neurons of the cortical subplate receive LGN input and participate in microcircuits with layer 4 cells during the first postnatal week (Friauf et al., 1990; Friauf and Shatz, 1991). <p> Intracortical projections within layer 4 of kitten striate cortex extend horizontally many hundreds of microns as early as the first postnatal week <ref> (Callaway and Katz, 1992) </ref>. In young rats, cortical cells are coupled by gap junctions over horizontal distances of about 100 m (Yuste et al., 1992; Peinado et al., 1993).

Reference-contexts: Thus, ON- and OFF-center cells in the LGN are segregated in separate laminae in mink (LeVay and McConnell, 1982), ferret (Stryker and Zahs, 1983), tree shrew <ref> (Conway and Schiller, 1983) </ref> and in the parvocellular layers in rhesus monkey (Schiller and Malpeli, 1978), but there is at most incomplete laminar segregation in cat (Bowling and Caverhill, 1989) and no obvious segregation in monkey magnocellular layers (Schiller and Malpeli, 1978).

Reference-contexts: An approximate reduced description can be derived that utilizes spatial phase and spatial frequency in addition to orientation as reduced variables, but the resulting interaction has a complicated structure (Miller, in preparation). Recent models using the "self-organizing feature map" (Obermayer et al., 1990, 1992) or "elastic net" <ref> (Durbin and Mitchison, 1990) </ref> algorithms represent an intermediate level of complexity. These models use a reduced set of variables to describe receptive fields and input activity patterns, but use a Hebb-type rule to describe development. Certain abstractions are used to describe cortical cell activation.

Reference-contexts: Orienta- Place Fig. 6 about here tion tuning curves under this linear response model are also shown. Note that, for receptive fields like these with oriented, segregated sets of ON- and OFF-center inputs, a more realistic response model can yield sharp orientation tuning curves with physiological levels of selectivity <ref> (Ferster, 1987) </ref>. A cell's preferred orientation can also be defined as the orientation corresponding to v R (x) (i.e., the angle of v R (x), divided by 2). This and the previous definition give results that are not discernibly different. <p> The timing of input activations can also make a strong contribution to orientation tuning <ref> (Ferster, 1987) </ref>. Thus, poor orientation tuning, or late development of sharp orientation tuning, in these cells constitute possible outcomes of development under the hypothesis, but probably do not constitute necessary outcomes. <p> Mature Degree of Orientation Tuning The present model accounts for the development of "Hubel-Wiesel" receptive fields. These have been shown adequate to yield mature orientation tuning, provided a more realistic model of cortical response is used <ref> (Ferster, 1987) </ref>. Intracortical inhibition may enhance this tuning (Worgotter and Koch, 1991). As discussed in Methods, the simple linear model of cortical cell response used here to assess selectivity does not yield mature orientation tuning, but this is a problem of the response model rather than of the developmental model. <p> It is unclear whether periodic, segregated subregions could nonetheless emerge, e.g. through cancellation of the balanced ON-center and OFF-center afferent drives and through intracortical interactions. If average positive afferent responses are sufficiently stronger than average negative responses <ref> (e.g. Ferster, 1987) </ref>, then all regions of 36 the final receptive field will give positive responses to all stimuli, so orientation selectivity will not result.

Reference-contexts: of the spatial structure of OFF subregions of cat simple cells after ON-center inputs to cortex are silenced (Sherk and Horton, 1984), and by the fact that simple cell subregion structure is present in both the pattern of excitatory input and the pattern of inhibitory input received by the cell <ref> (Ferster, 1988) </ref>. The development of unimodal cells might be accounted for in the present model in several ways. First, sufficient decrease of receptive field size during development leads some initially bimodal cells to become unimodal (Fig. 10A).

Reference-contexts: Biologically, simple cells receive "opponent inhibition": that is, ON-subregions receive ON-excitatory input and OFF-inhibitory input, and conversely for OFF-subregions (Palmer and Davis, 1981a; Mullikan et al 1984a,b; Ferster 1988). Inhibition can only come from other cortical cells 25 <ref> (Ferster and Lindstrom, 1983) </ref>, and such phase-specific inhibition could only come from other simple cells. Thus, it appears that when one simple cell inhibits another, the two develop "anti-overlapping" receptive fields, as the theory predicts.

Reference-contexts: ON and OFF retinal inputs to the LGN segregate into laminae in an activity-dependent manner between P14 and P21 in ferret <ref> (Hahm et al., 1991) </ref>, so some distinction in the activities of ON- and OFF-inputs is likely to exist in vivo at that time. Unless such a distinction is discovered in the waves of activity, they would not appear to be the correlation structure guiding ON/OFF segregation in LGN or cortex.

Reference-contexts: 10 RGC spacings (Mastronarde 1983a,b); cortical magnification factor is about 650m/degree (Tusa et al., 1978); X-cell arbors have a radius of 500-750 m (Humphrey et al., 1985), or 0.75 to 1.15 degrees; largest subregion is 1:67 ffi 0:63 ffi , and width of receptive field is 2:88 ffi 1:04 ffi <ref> (Heggelund, 1986) </ref>). Thus, the waves are so wide that they should simultaneously activate all geniculate inputs to a single cortical cell, and so would not appear "oriented" for purposes of competition on a single cell.

Reference-contexts: That the centers of most ON-center geniculate inputs overlap ON-subregions, and OFF overlap OFF, is also suggested by the preservation of the spatial structure of OFF subregions of cat simple cells after ON-center inputs to cortex are silenced <ref> (Sherk and Horton, 1984) </ref>, and by the fact that simple cell subregion structure is present in both the pattern of excitatory input and the pattern of inhibitory input received by the cell (Ferster, 1988). The development of unimodal cells might be accounted for in the present model in several ways. <p> Role of ON- and OFF-center Input Streams in Mature Orientation Selectivity After selective silencing of ON-center inputs in the retina of the mature animal, cortical cells in both cats <ref> (Sherk and Horton, 1984) </ref> and monkeys (Schiller, 1982) retain normal orientation tuning. The present hypothesis states that competition between ON-center and OFF-center inputs is necessary for the development of orientation selectivity, but not for its mature expression.

Many reports, beginning with <ref> (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962) </ref>, have established that a simple cell's preferred orientation is well predicted by the direction of the linear arrangement of the cell's ON and OFF subregions.

Thus, ON- and OFF-center cells in the LGN are segregated in separate laminae in mink <ref> (LeVay and McConnell, 1982) </ref>, ferret (Stryker and Zahs, 1983), tree shrew (Conway and Schiller, 1983) and in the parvocellular layers in rhesus monkey (Schiller and Malpeli, 1978), but there is at most incomplete laminar segregation in cat (Bowling and Caverhill, 1989) and no obvious segregation in monkey magnocellular layers (Schiller and

Reference-contexts: Cortical ocular dominance segregation is columnar in the cat and in some species of monkey, but there is at most incomplete segregation in other species of monkey <ref> (reviewed in LeVay and Nelson, 1991) </ref> and only a partial, laminar segregation in the tree shrew (Raczkowski and Fitzpatrick, 1990). Such variety suggests that the details of these patterns might not be functionally important, although alternatively they might represent functional specializations.

Reference-contexts: If such substances were released simultaneously over much of the dendritic arbor of a single cell, then the 100-150 m radius of such an arbor <ref> (Lund et al., 1979) </ref> might also play a role. In striate cortex of two-week old kittens, excitatory but not inhibitory intracortical synaptic connections are seen in studies of cross-correlations, and extend over horizontal distances of up to 600 microns (Hata et al., 1993). <p> The cortical magnification factor there is about 650m/degree (Tusa et al., 1978), so 0:5 ffi corresponds to about 325m across cortex. Geniculocortical X-cells in the adult cat typically arborize over a radius of 500-750m (Humphrey et al., 1985). Layer 4 spiny stellate cells have dendritic arborizations of radius 100-150m <ref> (Lund et al., 1979) </ref>. Assuming the arbor function corresponds to the overlap of these two arborizations, the zero-crossing of C D occurs at about 40-50% of an arbor radius, yielding an estimated mean preferred spatial frequency of about 1-1.25 cycles per arbor diameter.

Reference-contexts: A related model was proposed by Perez et al. (1975). A scenario like that studied here, in which a circularly symmetric, spatially oscillating correlation function leads to the development of orientation-selective receptive fields and to segregation of inputs within receptive fields, was first demonstrated by Linsker (1986a,b,c) <ref> (analyzed in MacKay and Miller, 1990a,b) </ref>. There are three major differences between Linsker's model and the present one. First, Linsker postulated feedforward synapses that could take either positive or negative strengths, rather than ON-center and OFF-center populations of purely excitatory inputs. <p> OFF-center synaptic input in each cortical receptive field. Orientation-selective receptive fields developed in his model only in a narrow, tightly tuned regime of the constraint parameter, and then only in the late, nonlinear stage of development <ref> (MacKay and Miller, 1990a) </ref>. Third, receptive field development was studied only in single, isolated cortical cells. The cortical organization of preferred orientation was studied only in the case that all cortical receptive fields are identical except for preferred orientation: that is, all have identical spatial phase and preferred spatial frequency.

Reference-contexts: be 1=(2L), where L is the diameter of the positive central region of the difference correlation function C D ; and I approximate L for inputs to cat area 17 or area 18 by twice the separation over which adult cat retinal X-cell or Y-cell correlations, respectively, go to zero <ref> (Mastronarde, 1983a,b) </ref>. Then spatial frequencies are predicted as follows: for X-cells, adult retinal correlations go to zero at a separation of one dendritic field diameter. <p> Then spatial frequencies are predicted as follows: for X-cells, adult retinal correlations go to zero at a separation of one dendritic field diameter. X-cell dendritic field diameter varies from 3.6 retinal ganglion cell (RGC) spacings at 2 ffi eccentricity, to 4.4 RGC spacings at 12 ffi eccentricity <ref> (Mastronarde, 1983a, P. 306) </ref>. Values at other eccentricities were obtained by linear interpolation or extrapolation from these two values. <p> Values at other eccentricities were obtained by linear interpolation or extrapolation from these two values. To convert RGC spacings to degrees of visual angle, the following formula was used <ref> (Mastronarde, 1983a) </ref>: let S=(RGC spacings per degree of visual angle); D=(density of RGC's in cells per square mm). Then S = 0:186 p D. Implementation of this conversion was based on a program provided to me by D.N. <p> For Y-cells, Mastronarde's data is more variable. A cutoff of 14 RGC spacings is suggested most strongly by the data <ref> (based on Mastronarde, 1983a, Figs. 3A,5A) </ref>, and was used, but values between 12 and 20 might also be justified. A smaller value would move the Y-cell curve vertically up, a larger value, vertically down. <p> A smaller value would move the Y-cell curve vertically up, a larger value, vertically down. Y-cell dendritic diameters range from 23.3 RGC spacings at 2 ffi eccentricity to 17.8 RGC spacings at 12 ffi eccentricity <ref> (Mastronarde, 1983a, P. 306) </ref>. I assumed that the correlations scale with this diameter, and linearly interpolated, proportionally to these two values, a line that passes through 14 RGC spacings at 7 ffi eccentricity (the eccentricity at which X-cells have the value 4 RGC spacings). <p> The function C D describes dark correlations measured as a function of input separation and center types in, for example, the LGN of early postnatal kittens. Such measurements have not been made, but similar measurements have been made in the retinae of adult cats <ref> (Mastronarde, 1983a,b) </ref>. There, like-center-type correlations were found to be positive, and opposite-type correlations negative, both falling to zero at a certain separation L ()=2 where is receptive field eccentricity. <p> The matches across eccentricities are reasonable. The error bars show the standard deviation in the predicted mean resulting only from the fact that the measured correlations vary with polar angle at a fixed eccentricity <ref> (Mastronarde, 1983a and private communication) </ref>. Several additional factors could account for the variability in the biological data. <p> I assume, as in the Results, that C D follows the correlation function measured in the mature cat retina, but extends to further distances with a change in sign. At 10 ffi eccentricity, adult retinal X-cell correlations go to zero at about 0:5 ffi separation <ref> (Mastronarde, 1983a,b) </ref>. The cortical magnification factor there is about 650m/degree (Tusa et al., 1978), so 0:5 ffi corresponds to about 325m across cortex. Geniculocortical X-cells in the adult cat typically arborize over a radius of 500-750m (Humphrey et al., 1985). <p> corresponding to 4-12 RGC spacings; the largest subregion of cat simple cell receptive fields corresponds to 5-20 RGC spacings; and the width of the entire receptive field is 9-40 RGC spacings (in adult cat at 10 ffi 12:5 ffi eccentricity: 1 ffi corresponds to between 5 and 10 RGC spacings <ref> (Mastronarde 1983a,b) </ref>; cortical magnification factor is about 650m/degree (Tusa et al., 1978); X-cell arbors have a radius of 500-750 m (Humphrey et al., 1985), or 0.75 to 1.15 degrees; largest subregion is 1:67 ffi 0:63 ffi , and width of receptive field is 2:88 ffi 1:04 ffi (Heggelund, 1986)). <p> Under the present model, development is determined by the correlation functions. The degree of correlation in dark activity of retinal ganglion X-cells appears to closely match the overlap of their dendritic fields <ref> (Mastronarde, 1983a,b) </ref>. The dendritic fields of retinal ganglion cells are reported to have elliptical biases, with a similar distribution across the retina as the biases of receptive fields (Leventhal and Schall, 1983; Schall et al., 1986).

Reference-contexts: They attribute the difference to their use of stimulus protocols that enhance detection of the weaker ON-responses. If their results are accepted, then the main problem for the current theory is that it ignores an early ON/OFF inequality, perhaps due to the greater dark activity of OFF inputs <ref> (Mastronarde, 1983b) </ref>, that leads to more rapid development of OFF responses in cortex.

This is reminiscent of afferent segregation in the cortex of minks <ref> (McConnell and LeVay, 1984) </ref> and ferrets (Zahs and Stryker, 1988), but segregation in the model is necessarily less complete. 17 Biologically, such afferent segregation may represent either segregation between postsynaptic cells, or convergence onto individual postsynaptic cells with spatial segregation occuring at the level of dendrites. <p> ON and OFF inputs to cortex show laminar segregation in tree shrew (Raczkowski and Fitzpatrick, 1990) but column-like segregation in mink <ref> (McConnell and LeVay, 1984) </ref> and ferret (Zahs and Stryker, 1988).

Reference-contexts: In ferret or kitten retina in vitro, this activity is organized spatially as oriented traveling waves of correlated bursting <ref> (Meister et al., 1991) </ref>. In ferret retina, this activity was observed as late as P22, and is no longer present at P30 (Wong et al., 1991).

In ferret retina, this activity was observed as late as P22, and is no longer present at P30 (Wong et al., 1991). In cat retina, it was observed as late as P1 (Meister et al., 1991). Retinal ganglion 31 cells could not be visually driven at the ages at which wave activity was observed (M. Meister, private communication). In comparison, as discussed previously, visual responses in ferret cortex first appear at P23, and the earliest recordings from cat cortex are from P6.

Reference-contexts: Here I summarize a few central results. Under a correlation-based mechanism, pairs of cortical cells with excitatory intracortical interactions tend to develop correlated receptive fields, while those with inhibitory intracortical interactions tend to develop anticorrelated receptive fields <ref> (Miller, 1990a) </ref>. The degree of correlation or anticorrelation of two simple cells depends not simply on their relative orientations, but on the relative retinotopic positions of each cell's ON- and OFF-subregions (Fig. 16). <p> A related model was proposed by Perez et al. (1975). A scenario like that studied here, in which a circularly symmetric, spatially oscillating correlation function leads to the development of orientation-selective receptive fields and to segregation of inputs within receptive fields, was first demonstrated by Linsker (1986a,b,c) <ref> (analyzed in MacKay and Miller, 1990a,b) </ref>. There are three major differences between Linsker's model and the present one. First, Linsker postulated feedforward synapses that could take either positive or negative strengths, rather than ON-center and OFF-center populations of purely excitatory inputs. <p> OFF-center synaptic input in each cortical receptive field. Orientation-selective receptive fields developed in his model only in a narrow, tightly tuned regime of the constraint parameter, and then only in the late, nonlinear stage of development <ref> (MacKay and Miller, 1990a) </ref>. Third, receptive field development was studied only in single, isolated cortical cells. The cortical organization of preferred orientation was studied only in the case that all cortical receptive fields are identical except for preferred orientation: that is, all have identical spatial phase and preferred spatial frequency.

Reference-contexts: This is biologically different from the present model, and also mathematically different: Linsker's equations would be fundamentally altered by the inclusion of nonlinearities, whereas the early development of the present model is independent of many nonlinearities <ref> (Miller, 1990c) </ref>. Second, Linsker used a constraint fixing the percentages of positive and negative synapses in the final receptive field of a cell. Applied to the present model, this would be equivalent to fixing the percentage of ON-center vs. OFF-center synaptic input in each cortical receptive field.

Reference-contexts: examined the effects on development, within the present framework of a single spatial phase per vertical position, of a constraint that limits the degree of change in the total synaptic strength over each input arbor to 50%, so that all inputs retain cortical connections (methods of constraint as described in <ref> (Miller et al., 1989) </ref>). Biologically, for example, a less successful input might compete more effectively once it has less total synaptic strength to support, while a more successful input might reach a limit to its ability to compete for further strength. <p> The model may be deepened or altered by incorporation of greater biophysical detail, plasticity of intra-cortical synapses, or additional possible mechanisms of plasticity such as sprouting and retraction of axonal terminals. The present study, in combination with previous studies <ref> (Miller et al., 1989) </ref>, demonstrates that simple mechanisms of correlation-based synaptic plasticity are adequate to account for a number of the most striking features of visual cortex.

Reference-contexts: First, the biological data includes both simple and complex cells from all laminae; variability is presumably less for simple cells in layer 4, the subject of the present model (the standard deviation for simple cells from all laminae in area 17 was 56% of the mean <ref> (Movshon et al., 1978a) </ref>). Second, the intracortical interactions induce variability, as shown in Fig. 8B (the standard deviation of best spatial frequency is 9-18% of the mean for the simulations shown in Fig. 9; it is higher for lower or higher values of r C ).

Reference-contexts: With this broader correlation function, some clusters of cells develop poor orientation selectivity and low preferred spatial frequencies (preferred spatial frequency is essentially inversely proportional to the width of the ON and OFF subregions of the receptive field <ref> (Movshon et al., 1978b) </ref>; see Methods). This is reminiscent of the conjunction of poor orientation selectivity and low preferred spatial frequencies reported in cytochrome oxidase blobs in monkey visual cortex (Sil-verman et al., 1989).

Reference-contexts: Experimentally, however, these predictions are quite different. These models similarly predict co-variation of preferred orientation and ocular dominance, and this accounts successfully for observed interactions between the two columnar systems in monkeys <ref> (Obermayer et al., 1992) </ref>. Simultaneous development of orientation and ocular dominance has not been studied with the present model.

Reference-contexts: An approximate reduced description can be derived that utilizes spatial phase and spatial frequency in addition to orientation as reduced variables, but the resulting interaction has a complicated structure (Miller, in preparation). Recent models using the "self-organizing feature map" <ref> (Obermayer et al., 1990, 1992) </ref> or "elastic net" (Durbin and Mitchison, 1990) algorithms represent an intermediate level of complexity. These models use a reduced set of variables to describe receptive fields and input activity patterns, but use a Hebb-type rule to describe development.

Reference-contexts: It should also be noted that the magno- and parvocellular pathways form matching ocular dominance and orientation columns, and so do not develop independently. In other species, such as ferrets (see Chapman, 1991) or tree shrew <ref> (see Raczkowski and Fitzpatrick, 1990) </ref>, the existence or distribution of simple cells has not yet been studied. <p> ON and OFF inputs to cortex show laminar segregation in tree shrew <ref> (Raczkowski and Fitzpatrick, 1990) </ref> but column-like segregation in mink (McConnell and LeVay, 1984) and ferret (Zahs and Stryker, 1988). <p> Cortical ocular dominance segregation is columnar in the cat and in some species of monkey, but there is at most incomplete segregation in other species of monkey (reviewed in LeVay and Nelson, 1991) and only a partial, laminar segregation in the tree shrew <ref> (Raczkowski and Fitzpatrick, 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Results in other species also appear consistent with the model, although less data is available. Normal, adult-like tuning and organization of orientation selectivity exists at birth in monkey V1 (Wiesel and Hubel, 1974) and in sheep V2 <ref> (Ramachandran et al., 1977) </ref>. Simple cells in newborn monkey are reported to be found primarily in layer 4 and to have segregated ON and OFF subregions (Hubel and Wiesel, 1968). In ferret (Chapman, 1991), some orientation selectivity is found as early as visual responses can be recorded (P23).

Reference-contexts: Why should this be the case? If random maps of preferred orientation are band-pass filtered, the resulting periodic but otherwise random orientation patterns closely resemble experimental orientation maps <ref> (Rojer and Schwartz, 1990) </ref>. <p> Direct application of a bandpass filter to a random pattern can similarly create a periodic pattern like that found biologically <ref> (Rojer and Schwartz, 1990) </ref>. Such reduced models of cortex usually depend on the ad hoc assumption that the reduced variables and a simple interaction between them are sufficient to describe cortical development. There are two problems with this assumption.

Reference-contexts: It has been proposed that this orientation bias may contribute to the development of cortical orientation selectivity (Albus et al., 1983; Schall et al., 1986). In support of this, it has been reported that the mature distributions with eccentricity of retinal preferred orientations and cortical preferred orientations are similar <ref> (Schall et al., 1986) </ref>. Under the present model, development is determined by the correlation functions. The degree of correlation in dark activity of retinal ganglion X-cells appears to closely match the overlap of their dendritic fields (Mastronarde, 1983a,b).

Reference-contexts: Role of ON- and OFF-center Input Streams in Mature Orientation Selectivity After selective silencing of ON-center inputs in the retina of the mature animal, cortical cells in both cats (Sherk and Horton, 1984) and monkeys <ref> (Schiller, 1982) </ref> retain normal orientation tuning. The present hypothesis states that competition between ON-center and OFF-center inputs is necessary for the development of orientation selectivity, but not for its mature expression.

Reference-contexts: This roughly agrees with findings that only about 20% of simple cells in the cat (Palmer and Davis, 1981; Mullikan et al., 33 1984a) and 27% in monkey <ref> (Schiller et al., 1976) </ref> are unimodal, that is, have only one excitatory subregion, either ON or OFF (but see Heggelund, 1986, who finds far fewer unimodal cells in cats). <p> The development of unimodal cells might be accounted for in the present model in several ways. First, sufficient decrease of receptive field size during development leads some initially bimodal cells to become unimodal (Fig. 10A). Consistent with this idea, in monkeys <ref> (Schiller et al., 1976) </ref> and cats (Palmer and Davis, 1981; Mullikan et al, 1984a,b) bimodal cells have receptive fields about twice as wide as unimodal cells. This suggests that subregions in either case are formed by a common competitive mechanism.

Reference-contexts: Thus, ON- and OFF-center cells in the LGN are segregated in separate laminae in mink (LeVay and McConnell, 1982), ferret (Stryker and Zahs, 1983), tree shrew (Conway and Schiller, 1983) and in the parvocellular layers in rhesus monkey <ref> (Schiller and Malpeli, 1978) </ref>, but there is at most incomplete laminar segregation in cat (Bowling and Caverhill, 1989) and no obvious segregation in monkey magnocellular layers (Schiller and Malpeli, 1978). <p> mink (LeVay and McConnell, 1982), ferret (Stryker and Zahs, 1983), tree shrew (Conway and Schiller, 1983) and in the parvocellular layers in rhesus monkey <ref> (Schiller and Malpeli, 1978) </ref>, but there is at most incomplete laminar segregation in cat (Bowling and Caverhill, 1989) and no obvious segregation in monkey magnocellular layers (Schiller and Malpeli, 1978). ON and OFF inputs to cortex show laminar segregation in tree shrew (Raczkowski and Fitzpatrick, 1990) but column-like segregation in mink (McConnell and LeVay, 1984) and ferret (Zahs and Stryker, 1988).

Reference-contexts: That the centers of most ON-center geniculate inputs overlap ON-subregions, and OFF overlap OFF, is also suggested by the preservation of the spatial structure of OFF subregions of cat simple cells after ON-center inputs to cortex are silenced <ref> (Sherk and Horton, 1984) </ref>, and by the fact that simple cell subregion structure is present in both the pattern of excitatory input and the pattern of inhibitory input received by the cell (Ferster, 1988). The development of unimodal cells might be accounted for in the present model in several ways. <p> Role of ON- and OFF-center Input Streams in Mature Orientation Selectivity After selective silencing of ON-center inputs in the retina of the mature animal, cortical cells in both cats <ref> (Sherk and Horton, 1984) </ref> and monkeys (Schiller, 1982) retain normal orientation tuning.

Reference-contexts: An example is artificial stimulation of the optic nerves while retinal neural activity is blocked, which has been accomplished but at a later developmental age <ref> (Stryker and Strickland, 1984) </ref>. These tests will be difficult to perform due to the early developmental age at which orientation selectivity develops. However, indirect evidence for a Mexican hat correlation structure may be sought through studies of LGN dark activity at later developmental times.

Reference-contexts: A third possibility is that an observed pattern might be one of a broad variety that can equally well be used to construct a functional visual system. Thus, ON- and OFF-center cells in the LGN are segregated in separate laminae in mink (LeVay and McConnell, 1982), ferret <ref> (Stryker and Zahs, 1983) </ref>, tree shrew (Conway and Schiller, 1983) and in the parvocellular layers in rhesus monkey (Schiller and Malpeli, 1978), but there is at most incomplete laminar segregation in cat (Bowling and Caverhill, 1989) and no obvious segregation in monkey magnocellular layers (Schiller and Malpeli, 1978).

Reference-contexts: In kittens before P14, nearly all oriented cells have been reported to be simple cells in deep layers of cortex (Blakemore and van Sluyters, 1975; Albus and Wolf, 1984), and to be largely or exclusively found in the adult geniculate-recipient layers 4 and 6 (Albus and Wolf, 1984) <ref> (but see Tsumoto and Suda, 1982) </ref>. Others report encountering both simple and complex cells in the youngest kittens (Hubel and Wiesel, 1963; Tsumoto and Suda, 1982; Braastad and Heggelund, 1985).

Reference-contexts: At 10 ffi eccentricity, adult retinal X-cell correlations go to zero at about 0:5 ffi separation (Mastronarde, 1983a,b). The cortical magnification factor there is about 650m/degree <ref> (Tusa et al., 1978) </ref>, so 0:5 ffi corresponds to about 325m across cortex. Geniculocortical X-cells in the adult cat typically arborize over a radius of 500-750m (Humphrey et al., 1985). Layer 4 spiny stellate cells have dendritic arborizations of radius 100-150m (Lund et al., 1979). <p> of cat simple cell receptive fields corresponds to 5-20 RGC spacings; and the width of the entire receptive field is 9-40 RGC spacings (in adult cat at 10 ffi 12:5 ffi eccentricity: 1 ffi corresponds to between 5 and 10 RGC spacings (Mastronarde 1983a,b); cortical magnification factor is about 650m/degree <ref> (Tusa et al., 1978) </ref>; X-cell arbors have a radius of 500-750 m (Humphrey et al., 1985), or 0.75 to 1.15 degrees; largest subregion is 1:67 ffi 0:63 ffi , and width of receptive field is 2:88 ffi 1:04 ffi (Heggelund, 1986)).

Reference-contexts: Results in other species also appear consistent with the model, although less data is available. Normal, adult-like tuning and organization of orientation selectivity exists at birth in monkey V1 <ref> (Wiesel and Hubel, 1974) </ref> and in sheep V2 (Ramachandran et al., 1977). Simple cells in newborn monkey are reported to be found primarily in layer 4 and to have segregated ON and OFF subregions (Hubel and Wiesel, 1968).

Reference-contexts: In ferret or kitten retina in vitro, this activity is organized spatially as oriented traveling waves of correlated bursting (Meister et al., 1991). In ferret retina, this activity was observed as late as P22, and is no longer present at P30 <ref> (Wong et al., 1991) </ref>. In cat retina, it was observed as late as P1 (Meister et al., 1991). Retinal ganglion 31 cells could not be visually driven at the ages at which wave activity was observed (M. Meister, private communication).

Reference-contexts: With the linear definition of response used here, higher harmonics primarily represent multiple peaks in the response function, so their presence should decrease the assessment of orientation selectivity; hence the present normalization is preferred. For physiological data, multiple peaks in the response function are rarely found <ref> (but see Worgotter and Eysel, 1991a) </ref> and higher harmonics primarily represent "sharp edges" in the response function (for example, a cell that shows positive response to some orientations and no response to the others) (B.

Reference-contexts: Mature Degree of Orientation Tuning The present model accounts for the development of "Hubel-Wiesel" receptive fields. These have been shown adequate to yield mature orientation tuning, provided a more realistic model of cortical response is used (Ferster, 1987). Intracortical inhibition may enhance this tuning <ref> (Worgotter and Koch, 1991) </ref>. As discussed in Methods, the simple linear model of cortical cell response used here to assess selectivity does not yield mature orientation tuning, but this is a problem of the response model rather than of the developmental model. <p> features of the design of the visual system, but rather could arise as one out of many equally usable possible arrangements, or even as epiphenomena of synaptic competition (the sharpening of orientation selectivity by intracortical connectivity, which might suggest design, can emerge out of very general properties of cortical connectivity <ref> (Worgotter and 38 Koch, 1991) </ref>). In the future, the current framework can be extended in several ways. Study of simultaneous competition between ON- and OFF-center inputs from the two eyes may reveal emergent relationships between ocular dominance, orientation, and disparity tuning.

Reference-contexts: Particularly with this broader function, a periodic arrangement of ON-dominated and OFF-dominated regions emerges. This is reminiscent of afferent segregation in the cortex of minks (McConnell and LeVay, 1984) and ferrets <ref> (Zahs and Stryker, 1988) </ref>, but segregation in the model is necessarily less complete. 17 Biologically, such afferent segregation may represent either segregation between postsynaptic cells, or convergence onto individual postsynaptic cells with spatial segregation occuring at the level of dendrites. <p> This regime might be appropriate to describe the ferret, where ON and OFF-center inputs are segregated across cortex <ref> (Zahs and Stryker, 1988) </ref> and only 40% of cells in the mature layer 4 are orientation tuned (Chapman, 1991). <p> Under this mechanism, at least some cortical cells must initially respond to their non-oriented LGN input before oriented responses could appear. In ferrets, which have a patchy arrangement of ON and OFF LGN inputs <ref> (Zahs and Stryker, 1988) </ref>, there are many non-oriented cells in layer 4 (Chapman, 1991) that could potentially provide such early responses. <p> ON and OFF inputs to cortex show laminar segregation in tree shrew (Raczkowski and Fitzpatrick, 1990) but column-like segregation in mink (McConnell and LeVay, 1984) and ferret <ref> (Zahs and Stryker, 1988) </ref>.
