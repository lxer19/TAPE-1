Reference-contexts: In a parity graph, each odd cycle of length at least five has two crossing chords. The class of parity graphs includes bipartite graphs and cographs. A polynomial algorithm for the recognition of parity graphs (based on three operations) is given in <ref> [3] </ref>. Furthermore, the problems maximum independent set, maximum clique, minimum coloring and minimum partition into cliques can be solved in polynomial time for these graphs (see also [3]). Recently, Cicerone and Di Stefano have given improved algorithms for the recognition, maximum weighted independent set and clique problem [5]. <p> A polynomial algorithm for the recognition of parity graphs (based on three operations) is given in <ref> [3] </ref>.

The list consists of the odd cycles C 2k+1 (k 2) or odd cycles having a short chord C fl 2k+1 (called generalized house) and the cycle C 5 with two non-crossing chords C flfl 5 (called gem).

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the constraints (2) correspond to the cliques in each of the copies of G. Thus, the polyhedron P (M) has only integral extreme points (or equivalent M is perfect), if and only if G fi K 2 is perfect (Chvatal <ref> [4] </ref>). Therefore, the goal is to find a characterization of graphs G such that G fi K 2 is perfect. We note that G fi K 2 is a bipartite graph, if G is bipartite; see also Figure 2. <p> Using this characterization and the theorem of Chvatal <ref> [4] </ref> (see also the section about perfect matrices), we obtain directly: Corollary 4.1 Let I be an instance of the GOCCP problem containing a graph G = (V; E) with n vertices and coloring costs k v;c such that k v;c = k v;3 for c 3 and v 2 V
