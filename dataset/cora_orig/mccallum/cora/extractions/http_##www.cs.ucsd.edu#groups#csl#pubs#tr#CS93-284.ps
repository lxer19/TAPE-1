Reference-contexts: Since FDDI is becoming the high-speed Local Area Network of choice and since the Sequoia 2000 network consists of interconnected FDDI rings, we have investigated techniques to extend to interconnected FDDI rings the performance guarantees offered by the FDDI synchronous mode <ref> [B92] </ref>. Furthermore, although the synchronous mode is an integral part of the FDDI standard, as well as a distinguishing characteristic of the FDDI medium access protocol, appropriate system software for synchronous mode is unfortunately not typically implemented.

IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, </booktitle> <address> Chicago, </address> <month> October </month> <year> 1992, </year> <pages> pp. 49-54. </pages>
Reference-contexts: The loss due to communication overhead is infinite for a period of zero, and rapidly decays as the period increases. Adding these loss functions gives the total loss, which generally has some minimum point, which is the optimal communication period. An analysis of this problem can be found in <ref> [BP92] </ref>. Decision-making problems in distributed systems generally require coordination among the entities in the system. In [GP93], we investigate a phenomenon we call "co-adaptation," whereby individual managers adapt their behavior in a complementary fashion to eventually achieve coordinated decision-making.

Reference-contexts: We are considering a number of prediction models based on game theory (agents within a group playing games, and groups playing games against each other) and learning automata (adaptive algorithms based on environmental feedback which reinforce or break down inter-agent relationships). In <ref> [BP93] </ref>, we investigate how delayed communication affects the dynamic formation of groups in distributed systems, where all decision-making agents join the same group because each expects to improve its own performance.

Reference-contexts: With insufficient communication, the agents decide to work alone (and receive a modest benefit) but, with sufficient communication, the agents make the more advantageous decision to work together. In <ref> [BP93a] </ref>, we consider load balancing over a network of processors given aged load information. We introduce a concept called "scope of control" of a scheduling agent, which determines the set of remote processors which the agent will consider for its load balancing decisions.

Reference-contexts: Providing location transparent services across a network is a problem which can be addressed at multiple levels, from the data-link layer to the application layer. In <ref> [CP92] </ref> we provide a survey of issues related to this problem as well as a set of existing and proposed solutions. 6 One of our main areas of concentration is currently the investigation of network architectures and protocols supporting Digital Continuous Media (DCM), i.e., digital audio, video, and other media in

Reference-contexts: This research is of particular importance now since new services not only dramatically increase network traffic, but can also completely change traffic profiles. Our initial traffic characterization results, focusing on the T1 NSFNET backbone, appeared in <ref> [CPB93] </ref>. We are now studying the accuracy of various traffic sampling mechanisms for data collection; this is very important for high-speed networks where the amount of traffic makes it almost impossible to capture complete traces.

Reference-contexts: For example, our study of Internet latencies has shown that the widely used approximation of unidirectional latencies by half the round-trip "ping" delay can be considerably inaccurate <ref> [CPB93b] </ref>. Since FDDI is becoming the high-speed Local Area Network of choice and since the Sequoia 2000 network consists of interconnected FDDI rings, we have investigated techniques to extend to interconnected FDDI rings the performance guarantees offered by the FDDI synchronous mode [B92].

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we have made modifications to Ultrix device drivers and have extended network protocols in order to enable applications with real-time requirements to take advantage of the synchronous mode delay guarantees <ref> [J92, E93] </ref>. In the area of Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) we have focused on a key problem in the DQDB protocol. The Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB) protocol is the channel access mechanism of the proposed IEEE MAN standard (IEEE 802.6).

Reference-contexts: In addition, we are providing better integration of I/O system and network software, optimizing the performance of the latter by using the same minimal data copying techniques. A design and implementation of these some of ideas <ref> [FP93] </ref> demonstrates the feasibility and performance gains of this approach.

Reference-contexts: The project was initiated by DEC with initial seed funding totaling $15 million for 3 years; additional sponsors are now being sought. CSL, in collaboration with the Tenet Group at UC Berkeley, is responsible for designing the Sequoia 2000 Network (S2Knet) <ref> [FPP92] </ref>. The S2Knet is a private, wide area packet switched network providing high throughput for distributed scientific applications, and real-time services for multimedia collaboration tools such as video-conferencing.

In <ref> [GP93] </ref>, we investigate a phenomenon we call "co-adaptation," whereby individual managers adapt their behavior in a complementary fashion to eventually achieve coordinated decision-making.

Reference-contexts: Of course, the difficult part is to make the scheme operate without undue complexity and external intelligence or intervention, and also to guarantee that no traffic is lost during the transients. We present this design in <ref> [KPP92] </ref> together with some initial performance results which support our expectations for fairness, in terms of both throughput and delay.

Reference-contexts: We present this design in [KPP92] together with some initial performance results which support our expectations for fairness, in terms of both throughput and delay. We further investigate the performance of the RSG scheme in <ref> [KPP92a] </ref> where we show that not only does the approach provide fair service, but it is also more efficient than other mechanisms proposed in order to improve DQDB fairness. <p> The problem of finding optimal tree forwarding routes from a source to the members of a multicast group under given delay constraints is intractable. Therefore, we have developed heuristics which are both efficient 7 and effective, typically providing feasible solutions that are only a few percent less than optimal <ref> [KPP92a] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Other problems, such as lack of support for real-time synchronization, are also important, but are secondary to the data movement problem. We have also investigated file system design for very large file I/O such as that required for scientific applications or multimedia (e.g. audio and video) applications <ref> [MP91] </ref>. The design was driven by results of a file workload characterization study we carried out on a heavily utilized file system at UCSD. File requests at the system call level were characterized as either control (e.g. open, close, chmod), data read, or data write.

Reference-contexts: We are concerned with decentralized allocation of resources, its fundamental problems, and how to overcome these problems <ref> [P91] </ref>. Decentralized control offers many benefits over centralized control algorithms, such as speed (through parallel processing and keeping control near data), reliability (by avoiding single points of failure), scalability (because of symmetric control relationships), and autonomy (by allowing control over local resources to be kept locally).

Reference-contexts: Randomization is often used to coordinate decision-making agents so that decentralized access decisions over a shared space of resources can be made in a minimally-conflicting manner, with minimal communication. In <ref> [P93] </ref>, we investigate the performance of an autonomous decentralized system based on a model which is limited to the simultaneous probabilistic access of resources by multiple managers: given m busy managers and r free resources, each manager decides to access a resource with probability a, and each resource is selected with

Reference-contexts: We are investigating I/O system software architectures which support fast I/O switching of communication resources (e.g., the system bus) to support multiple I/O streams with time-varying bandwidth requirements and other real-time constraints <ref> [P93a] </ref>. Consider a program which emits motion video at a rate of 30 frames/sec in a window with resolution 1280 fi 1024 pixels. If each pixel requires three bytes for describing color, the total output bandwidth required by this program is approximately 118 megabytes/sec.

Reference-contexts: The actual construction of the S2Knet is a large distributed engineering effort involving all the Sequoia sites; a "handbook" serves as an implementation guide as new sites are added, and is continually updated to reflect the current status of the network <ref> [PFF92] </ref>.

We believe that operating systems design must shift from the traditional focus of managing CPU cycles to that of managing I/O channel bandwidth which is increasingly becoming the scarce resource [P92].

Reference-contexts: Based on current application I/O characterizations one can extrapolate future I/O application requirements, and then through synthesis determine overall I/O workload intensities and patterns. Results of our analyses support our hypothesis that a significant proportion of I/O intensive, long running, frequently executed scientific applications have predictable I/O requirements <ref> [PP92] </ref>. Our emphasis on application I/O and what we learn will be applicable to and benefit a larger audience including disciplines outside of computer science. It is our experience that the scientists and engineers running these codes are very interested in learning about the performance of their applications.

Reference-contexts: We are investigating the performance of these schemes both empirically and analytically on random graphs and graphs resulting from specific network topologies. In <ref> [PPAK92] </ref>, we describe a new communication abstraction for dissemination-based communication of multimedia. It is based on a Cable-TV model: a source places media streams on a channel, without explicit interaction with receivers; receivers can dynamically "tune in" to channels of interest, without explicit interaction with the source.

Reference-contexts: Current I/O system software found in most operating systems is ill-suited for the high throughput requirements of multimedia and scientific applications which have I/O components consisting of video, high quality audio, high resolution images, and massive scientific data sets <ref> [PP90, P+91] </ref>. We believe that operating systems design must shift from the traditional focus of managing CPU cycles to that of managing I/O channel bandwidth which is increasingly becoming the scarce resource [P92].

Reference-contexts: Therefore, less important signal components can be dropped without causing an interruption of service; communication can continue in the presence of delays, errors, or network congestion, with only a moderate drop in service quality <ref> [P93b] </ref>. We also address the analytical performance evaluation of systems supporting DCM flows. For traditional data traffic, Poisson arrivals and either exponential or constant packet sizes (leading to M/M/1 or M/D/1 queueing systems, respectively), have been shown in the past to provide acceptable analytic approximations.
