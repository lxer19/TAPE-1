Abstract: We present FAQ Minder, an implemented prototype of the system that parses FAQs, files of Frequently Asked Questions associated with USENET newsgroups. The system identifies and tags, in an interactive manner, the logical components of FAQs: network headers, tables of contents, sections, glossaries, questions, answers, and bibliographies. Such parsing of FAQs is part of FAQ Finder, a question-answering system that uses FAQs as its knowledge base.

Reference-contexts: significant assistance for a system that retrieves answers from it in response to users' questions. 1 We use the terms the logical structure of a document and the structural organization of information in a document interchangeably. 1 Our approach to document processing emerged from the ongoing research on FAQ Finder <ref> [1] </ref>, a question-answering system whose main source of knowledge is the files of "Frequently Asked Questions" (FAQs) [2]. <p> FAQ Minder has four types of constraints. Each constraint is defined with respect to one of the three types of marker sequences. For lack of space, we give one example per constraint type: Recursion Constraints: Alphanumeric sequences do not recurse. E.g., &lt; seq1 &gt; <ref> [1] </ref> .... text ..... &lt; seq1 &gt; [2] .... text ..... &lt; seq1 &gt; [3] .... text ..... ........ text ..... &lt; seq2 &gt; [1] .... text ..... 2 We use the terms markers and marker sequences to refer to orthographic markers and orthographic marker sequences. 3 The recursion constraint forces <p> For lack of space, we give one example per constraint type: Recursion Constraints: Alphanumeric sequences do not recurse.

As an example, consider the following chunk of text with the layout characters made visible: &lt;line 0&gt; Tab Tab Space <ref> [1] </ref> first line. &lt;line 1&gt; Newline &lt;line 2&gt; Tab Tab Tab Space [1-0] second line. &lt;line 3&gt; Newline &lt;line 4&gt; Tab Tab Tab Space [1-1] third line. &lt;line 5&gt; Newline &lt;line 6&gt; Tab Tab Space [2] fourth line.
