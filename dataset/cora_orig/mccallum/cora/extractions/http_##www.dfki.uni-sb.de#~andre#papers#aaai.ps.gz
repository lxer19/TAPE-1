Title: Coping with Temporal Constraints in Multimedia Presentation Planning

Abstract: Computer-based presentation systems enable the realization of effective and dynamic presentation styles that incorporate multiple media. Obvious examples are animated user interface agents which verbally comment on multimedia objects displayed on the screen while performing cross-media and cross-window pointing gestures. The design of such presentations must account for the temporal coordination of media output and the agent's behavior. In this paper we describe a new presentation system which not only creates the multimedia objects to be presented, but also generates a script for presenting the material to the user. In our system, this script is forwarded to an animated presentation agent running the presentation. The paper details the kernel of the system which is a component for planning temporally coordinated multimedia.

Reference-contexts: Qualitative temporal constraints are represented in an "Allen-style" fashion which allows for the specification of thirteen temporal relationships between two named intervals: before, meets, overlaps, during, starts, finishes, equal and inverses of the first six relationships (cf. <ref> (Allen 1983) </ref>). Allen's representation also permits the expression of disjunctions, such as (A (before after) B), which means that A occurs before or after B. Metric constraints appear as difference (in)equalities on the endpoints of named intervals.

Starting from a presentation goal, the presentation planner searches for plan operators and builds up a refinement-style plan in the form of a DAG.

Reference-contexts: The results of the generators are taken as input for the design of the presentation script which is forwarded to the display components for execution. The task of the layout manager is the determination of effective screen layouts and the maintenance of user interactions. The Persona Server (cf. <ref> (Andre, Muller, & Rist 1996) </ref>) carries out Persona actions which, among other things, includes assembling appropriate animation sequences. Both display components signal when they have accomplished their tasks and inform the presentation planner about the occurrence of interaction events, such as mouse-clicks on windows.

Reference-contexts: In contrast to this, our system is not only able to design multimedia material, but also plans presentation acts and their temporal coordination. A first attempt ot incorporate time into an automated presentation system has been made by Feiner and colleagues (cf. <ref> (Feiner et al. 1993) </ref>). However, they only investigate how temporal information can be conveyed by dynamic media and don't present a mechanism for synchronizing them.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, multimedia material along with timing information specified by PPP can be used as input for existing presentation engines, such as the CMIFed environment <ref> (Hardman, Bulterman, & van Rossum 1994) </ref>. Future work will concentrate on more complex user interactions. Currently, the system clock is stopped when the user interrupts a presentation and started again when he resumes it. However, we also want to explicitly represent temporal relationships between presentation acts and interaction acts.

Reference-contexts: To enable the processing of temporal constraints, we have combined PPP's presentation planner PREPLAN with RAT (cf. Fig. 6). RAT is a system for representing and reasoning about actions and plans, which relies on an extended version of Kautz's and Ladkin's MATS system <ref> (Kautz & Ladkin 1991) </ref>. For each node of the presentation plan, the planner creates a local constraint network which includes the temporal constraints of the corresponding plan operators.

Reference-contexts: The work closest to our own is that being carried out by Microsoft Research in the Persona project (cf. <ref> (Kurlander & Ling 1995) </ref>). In the current prototype system, a parrot called Peedy acts as a conversational assistant who accepts user requests for audio CDs.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the pointing gesture should be maintained while the name of the respective object is uttered. Concerning the temporal relation between presentation acts and production acts, it is clear, that the presentation of material cannot start before its production. However, sometimes been considered in previous classifications, e.g. <ref> (Maybury 1993b) </ref>. material is generated incrementally so that the presentation may start before the production is completed. For some purposes, it can also be reasonable to specify the temporal order in which a set of production acts should be carried out.
