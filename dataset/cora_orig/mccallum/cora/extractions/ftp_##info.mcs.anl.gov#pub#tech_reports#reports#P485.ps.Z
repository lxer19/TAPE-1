Abstract: To simplify the analysis of interior-point methods, one commonly formulates the problem so that the objective function is linear, by introducing a single extra variable if necessary. Here we show that a linear objective function makes the Newton direction for a barrier function a useful search direction if the current iterate is sufficiently close to the central path. Hence, there are two advantages to using a linear objective and staying close to the central path. First, the Newton direction (which coincides with the affine scaling direction on the central path) gives a very accurate approximation to the direction to the minimum. Second, a long step along the Newton direction is possible without violating the inequality constraints.

Reference-contexts: Methods based on (3) approximate x () for a sequence of small, decreasing values of &gt; 0. Under certain conditions (see Fiacco and McCormick <ref> [1] </ref>), we have lim #0 x () = x fl . <p> We need to check that the line segment defined by x + ff ( + =)p; ff 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; (36) lies within the feasible region, except perhaps for values of ff close to 1. It suffices to check that the constraints that are active at x fl are satisfied. <p> + ff ( + =)p) = c i (x) + ffrc i (x) T ( + =)p + O ( 2 ) = i fl Hence, if the segment (36) crosses the i-th constraint, we have c i (x + ff ( + =)p) = 0 for some ff 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Full rank of A (x fl ) then implies that z i = 0, i = 1; : : : ; p. Hence z = 0, and our claim is proved. The following result is a consequence of the implicit function theorem (see, for example, Lang <ref> [2, p. 131] </ref>). Theorem 3.1 Let the vector pair (x (z; oe); (z; oe)) be defined implicitly as the solution of the nonlinear system F (x; ) = z # for given (z; oe).

Reference-contexts: It has recently been observed (see, for example, Wright <ref> [3] </ref>) that the resulting direction is generally a poor one, and some specialized direction generation and line search strategies have been proposed to remedy the situation. Below, we illustrate the bad behavior of these steps by means of a simple example.
