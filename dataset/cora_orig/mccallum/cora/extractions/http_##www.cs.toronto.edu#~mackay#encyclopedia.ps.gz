Abstract: This paper (which is still in preparation) describes empirical properties of a wide selection of these codes, comparing in particular the codes' block error rates with an emphasis on undetected versus detected errors. We explore the dependence of block error rate on block length and other code construction parameters. Histograms of decoding time are also shown. Draft 1 concentrates on small block lengths.

Reference-contexts: In my experience RA codes with smaller block lengths make more undetected errors. I'm going to investigate further these undetected errors (which sometimes correspond to codewords and sometimes to near codewords). Discussion The Divsalar, Jin and McEliece paper <ref> [1] </ref> contains graphs for up to 30 iterations. Histogram (a) above shows that roughly 50% of the decodings in my simulation at 0.65dB took more than 30 iterations, with a small but substantial number taking more than 60 iterations.

Reference-contexts: of codes with rates 191=273 = 0:7 and 813=1057 = 0:77, and a collection of codes with rates greater than 0.89 and block lengths around 2000 and 4000. 2.1 Rates 0.7 and 0.77 2.2 Codes with rates above 0.89 More results on these codes can be found in another publication <ref> [3] </ref>. 2.3 Discussion In practical systems such as disc drives, people concatenate an outer ECC with an inner run-length-limiting code (RLL code), the latter being small and non-linear. This doesn't seem ideal, since it means that the errors confronting the ECC are rather complex.
