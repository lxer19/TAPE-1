Abstract: Teaching Experience Instructor Department of Computer Science Univ. of North Carolina at Chapel Hill June August 1997 Taught a perspectives course on computing titled "Computers: Power Tools for the Mind." The lectures covered a broad range of topics including elementary computer organization, the use of common software applications, an introduction to programming, and the computer's potential for use and abuse in our society. The laboratory portion of the course provided hands-on experience with popular personal computer applications and an opportunity to design and write simple programs. Instructor contract with Naval Research Labs S.M. Goddard & Co., Inc. July 1989 - December 1989 Developed and taught "E005: Developing Applications for the AN/UYS-2A." This 40 hour course on programming and debugging an embedded signal processor was taught on site at AT&T, Hughes Aircraft, General Electric, and Boeing. The course consisted of both lecture and hands-on lab assignments.
