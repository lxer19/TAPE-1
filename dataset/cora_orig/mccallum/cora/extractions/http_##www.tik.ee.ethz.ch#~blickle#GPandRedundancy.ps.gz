Abstract: The Genetic Programming optimization method (GP) elaborated by John Koza [ Koza, 1992 ] is a variant of Genetic Algorithms. The search space of the problem domain consists of computer programs represented as parse trees, and the crossover operator is realized by an exchange of subtrees. Empirical analyses show that large parts of those trees are never used or evaluated which means that these parts of the trees are irrelevant for the solution or redundant. This paper is concerned with the identification of the redundancy occuring in GP. It starts with a mathematical description of the behavior of GP and the conclusions drawn from that description among others explain the "size problem" which denotes the phenomenon that the average size of trees in the population grows with time.

This process is repeated as often until the desired population size is reached.

Reference-contexts: The adjustment of the parameters ff and fi is the main problem of this approach because they depend heavily on the problem and the rawfit function. Examples can be found in <ref> [ Koza, 1992; Kinneth E. Kinnear, 1993 ] </ref> . <p> This kind of description differs form that of the Genetic Programming Paradigm in <ref> [ Koza, 1992 ] </ref> but is mathematically equivalent. 2.1 Reproduction Phase Definition 2.1 The reproduction rate s 0 (f) denotes the expected number of individuals with fitness value f after the reproduction phase. s (f) denotes the number of individuals with fitness value f before reproduction. <p> Now some effects of this theory are derived and experimentally verified. The 6-multiplexer problem from <ref> [ Koza, 1992 ] </ref> served as test problem. The 6-multiplexer problem was chosen because it allows to determine the total redundancy in the trees. To achieve this sequentially in each edge of every tree a boolean NOT was inserted. <p> Another way to observe the increasing redundancy is to continue a GP run even if a best solution is found. <ref> [ Koza, 1992 ] </ref> reported the phenomenon that after some generations there are almost 70-80% best-fit individuals, but almost all best trees are different. This can be explained straightforward with redundancy: the trees are all different but belong to only a small number of different redundancy classes. <p> So both subtrees will be evaluated and the redundancy will not be discovered. The marking method also depends strongly on the function set used to solve the optimization problem. Experimentally we investigated the effect of the marking method for three problems taken from <ref> [ Koza, 1992 ] </ref> . For the 6-multiplexer problem the performance was almost doubled, as can be seen in Figure 6. The parameter setting was the same as in the experiment described above with a tournament size of 10.

Reference-contexts: This process is repeated as often until the desired population size is reached. The tournament size t strongly affects the behaviour of the reproduction method. The expected number of best individuals for tournament selection (with replacement) can be exactly derived (see <ref> [ Rheinert, 1994 ] </ref> ). Theorem 2.1 Let M be the population size, s (f b ) the number of current best individuals with fitness f b .

Conor Ryan recently suggested a special case of multi-modal fitness functions named "Pygmies and Civil Servants" <ref> [ Ryan, 1994 ] </ref> where he uses two criteria to determine the fitness: one list keeps track of the best rawfit individuals, in a second list the sorting criterion is the size of the individuals.

These informations are used to select "better" subtrees for crossover to achieve a better convergence. <p> A is redundant it follows immediately that all edges in the subtree located at edge A are redundant, too. * The redundancy of en edge A in general depends on the context. * All nodes located at redundant edges are redundant nodes. * The non-redundant nodes are also called "atomic" <ref> [ Tackett, 1994 ] </ref> . <p> By this the tree size will grow with time and the "size problem" can be explained with redundancy. Figure 5 shows that the average tree size for a given fitness value is smaller, if a higher repro-duction rate is chosen. A comparison with the results in <ref> [ Tackett, 1994 ] </ref> is given in the next section. So if the redundancy can be reduced the average tree size will be reduced at the same time. <p> The third example was the artificial ant problem, where the almost no improvement occurred. 5 Discussion In Section 3 we explained the size problem using redundancy. In <ref> [ Tackett, 1994 ] </ref> Walter Tackett states that the average growth in size is proportional to selection pressure, and he gives an example of a deceptive problem solved with several selection methods to verify his statement.
