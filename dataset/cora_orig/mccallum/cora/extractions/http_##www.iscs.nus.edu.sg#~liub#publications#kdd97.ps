Abstract: One of the important problems in data mining is the evalu a-tion of subjective interestingness of the discovered rules. Past research has found that in many real-life applications it is easy to generate a large number of rules from the dat abase, but most of the rules are not useful or interesting to the user. Due to the large number of rules, it is difficult for the user to analyze them manually in order to identify those interesting ones. Whether a rule is of interest to a user d e-pends on his/her existing knowledge of the domain, and his/her interests. In this paper, we propose a technique that analyzes the discovered rules against a specific type of e x-isting knowledge, which we call general impressions , to help the user identify interesting rules. We first propose a representation language to allow general impressions to be specified. We then present some algorithms to analyze the discovered classification rules against a set of general i m-pressions. The results of the analysis tell us which rules conform to the general impressions and which rules are une x-pected. Unexpected rules are by definition interesting.
