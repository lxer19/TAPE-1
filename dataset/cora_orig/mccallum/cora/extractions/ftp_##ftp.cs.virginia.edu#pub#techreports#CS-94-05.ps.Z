Title: Mentat 2.5 Programming Language Reference Manual  
Note: The Mentat Research Group  
Abstract: Technical Report No. CS-94-05 February 17, 1994 
Abstract-found: 1

Reference-contexts: Mentat strikes a balance between fully automatic and fully explicit schemes. There are two primary components of Mentat: the Mentat Programming Language (MPL) and the Mentat run-time system. MPL is an object-oriented programming language based on C++ <ref> [Stroustrup] </ref> that masks the difficulty of the parallel environment from the programmer. The granule of computation is the Mentat class instance, which consists of contained objects (local and member variables), their procedures, and a thread of control.

Reference-contexts: In general, the returned graph may be arbitrarily complex, as in the matrix multiply exam ple. 7.0 Select/Accept Some form of guarded statements are provided in many modern programming languages. Examples include the select/accept statements of ADA <ref> [Ada] </ref> and guarded statements in CSP [Hoare]. Guarded statements permit the programmer to specify a set of entry points to a monitor-like construct. The guards are boolean expressions based on local variables and constants. A guard is assigned to each possible entry point.
