Abstract: Exploitation of the historical record of meteorological data has long been impeded by an inability to rapidly identify relevant data, and by the difficulties of managing the huge volume of data involved. This paper presents a new approach to archiving and retrieving meteorological data that addresses these problems. Techniques of case-based reasoning from artificial intelligence are employed to construct a knowledge base that summarizes the content of a much larger archive. This knowledge base facilitates intelligent retrieval of past data from high-level descriptions of their content. Once relevant data are retrieved, analyses and summary views of the data can be immediately displayed. Full data sets can also be retrieved from slower media such as CD-ROM or magnetic tape if a more detailed investigation is required. The approach is implemented in MetVUW Workbench, a system for intelligent retrieval and display of historical meteorological data. The system is intended to serve as a memory amplifier for meteorologists that allows them to rapidly locate, analyse, and display historical situations of interest. Effective retrieval from large archives of environmental data requires addressing two problems: identifying relevant data, and managing the huge volume of data involved. This paper addresses both these problems as they arise in the construction of an archive for meteorological data. The approach is implemented in MetVUW Workbench, a system for intelligent retrieval and display of historical meteorological data [Roydhouse et al., 1993, Jones and Roydhouse, 1994]. The system is intended to serve as a memory amplifier for meteorologists that allows them to rapidly locate historical situations of interest. Two groups of end users are anticipated:

Reference-contexts: During the development of MetVUW Workbench, a portion of this numeric data has been employed that covers the Australasian region. Case retrieval matches queries (sometimes called index probes <ref> [Domeshek, 1991] </ref>) against explicitly represented index labels. Queries identify particular features of the current situation that appear to be meteorologically significant. Index labels are representations of high-level features of the weather situation in a case. As far as possible, index labels are extracted automatically from the raw data.

Reference-contexts: MetVUW Workbench uses a relational database called Postgres to implement case selection [Stonebraker and Rowe, 1986]. Postgres provides a number of sophisticated indexing methods, including R-tree indexing of spatial data <ref> [Guttman, 1984] </ref>. A relational database is used so that the current system will readily scale up to a very large case base.

Reference-contexts: Detailed examination of particular past cases can also usefully guide analysis of the current situation. <ref> [Hunter, 1989] </ref>. In the context of meteorological research, MetVUW Workbench is expected to open up a wealth of possibilities for empirical investigation. In the past, large-scale investigations have been impeded by the difficulty of rapidly identifying relevant data.

Reference-contexts: However, adequate performance for large case bases using existing hardware requires a procedure for case selection that scales sub-linearly with the size of the case base. Two standard evaluation metrics from the information retrieval literature <ref> [Jacobs, 1992] </ref> can usefully guide the design of a suitable algorithm for case selection: * The precision of an information retrieval system is the percentage of items retrieved in response to a query that are good answers to the query. * The recall of an information retrieval system is the proportion

Reference-contexts: If more detailed analyses are required, larger amounts of data relating to a particular situation can be retrieved using slower media such as CD-ROM or magnetic tape. MetVUW Workbench comprises the retrieval component of a case-based reasoning system <ref> [Riesbeck and Schank, 1989, Kolodner, 1991, Kolodner, 1993] </ref>. Each case is a slice of time for which meteorological data is available.

Reference-contexts: Exactly how these assessments should trade off against one another is a difficult issue, and experiments with different alternatives are still proceeding. MetVUW Workbench currently employs a form of breadth-bounded depth-first search with successor ordering <ref> [Pearl, 1984] </ref> that appears to strike an appropriate balance. The algorithm determines a set of correspondences between low-pressure regions in the query and low-pressure regions in a case that yield both good overall similarity of structure and good pairwise similarity between corresponding regions.
