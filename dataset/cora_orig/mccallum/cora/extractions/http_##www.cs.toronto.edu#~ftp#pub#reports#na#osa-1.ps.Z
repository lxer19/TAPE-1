Abstract: We present a numerical procedure to solve a set of nonlinear coupled mode equations on a finite interval. These equations originally arose in the study of the dynamics of gap solitons in nonlinear periodic media. Our procedure, which makes use of an implicit 4 th order Runge-Kutta method, is easy to implement, versatile, and very well suited for vec-torization or parallelization.
