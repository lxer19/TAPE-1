Abstract: Recent business improvement methodologies, such as Business Process Reengi-neering, advocate the redesign of business processes as the primary method to obtain improvement in business performance. Current approaches to process redesign assist the reengineer in identifying problems in meeting business goals, but provide little support in determining how to resolve those problems to meet the desired goals. The number of feasible changes to the business that can potentially resolve the problems is large and it is hard to predict the effect that each change will have on overall business performance. We present a process redesign methodology that helps reengineers to efficiently generate changes that can help meet business performance goals. Based on the methodology, we describe a system that includes: (1) an executable business model for specifying business processes and business performance goals; (2) a simulator that executes these processes to determine actual performance and to help reengineers identify problems in meeting the specified goals; and (3) a performance improvement knowledge base that suggests changes to resolve these problems and meet the specified goals. We demonstrate the use of the process redesign methodology and the system on two non-trivial process redesign examples, and report our experience.

Reference-contexts: Even given specific problems, the suggestion of modification options is difficult because there are a variety of ways to solve a problem, so it may be hard to identify the better options. 2 A fairly extensive summary of process redesign MIS publications through 1994 is provided in <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 In particular, when a modification option eliminates one problem it often exposes another business problem, so finding options that balance these trade-offs appropriately is difficult. We present a process redesign system (PRS) that supports the reengineers in all the process redesign tasks listed above.

Reference-contexts: One operator can undo a goal achieved by another operator in a manner analogous to clobbering in non-linear planning <ref> [6] </ref>. As we saw in the sales distributorship example, the achievement of a response time goal by adding a resource can undo the satisfaction of the cost goal. Because of this interaction, the solution space must be reevaluated after each operator application.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Most recent business improvement methodologies operate under the assumption that the performance 1 of a business is determined by the performance of its constituent business processes. Methodologies, such as Business Process Reengineering [13], Business Process Innovation <ref> [7] </ref>, and Business Process Improvement [14], all advocate the redesign of business processes as the means to obtain overall business improvement. <p> In this paper, we describe a process redesign methodology that uses simulation and performance improvement knowledge to assist the reengineers in the generation of modification options to find a process design that satisfies their goals.

Our definition of process redesign is closest to goals of Business Process Innovation <ref> [7] </ref>. Davenport grants that both radical and incremental process redesign have their place in business improvement. Our problem definition makes no commitment to whether radical or incremental improvement is required. It is the job of the reengineers to determine the aggressiveness of the goals.

Reference-contexts: Once all the step response times have been estimated, the modified critical path can be derived. Average step execution times are computed per business flow execution rather than step execution, so loops and conditional blocks can be removed. Using these values, a standard critical path algorithm can be used <ref> [9] </ref>. The overall evaluation of an operator is based on the evaluation of the operator on the current goal parameter, the effect that the operator has on previously optimized goal parameters, and other goal parameter limits.

If less ambitious goals are set, then the process redesign may require only incremental changes, as in Business Process Improvement <ref> [14] </ref>. The process redesign problem is theoretically complex because: (1) operators interact by clobbering the effects of prior modifications and (2) the number of operators for a large number of steps, triggers, and resources is large.

Reference-contexts: In simulation-based redesign [2, 3, 4, 24, 33], the reengineers are required to build a formal, executable model of the business. This model is simulated to help identify performance problems and evaluate suggested modification options. Knowledge-based redesign <ref> [25, 37, 39] </ref> involves the construction of semantic models that enable the reengineers to assess the semantic impact of modifications. In both of these approaches, the reengi-neers must suggest the modification options for resolving any business problems. <p> However, this metric does identify problems where there is a high potential for improvement. In our methodology, we use such metrics to help narrow down the search for modification options that are likely to have the most impact in meeting the goals. Knowledge-based analysis systems <ref> [25, 37, 39] </ref> assist reengineers in identifying semantic problems in the business, but do not support performance analysis. For example, one system supports the definition of a goal hierarchy for a process [25]. <p> Knowledge-based analysis systems [25, 37, 39] assist reengineers in identifying semantic problems in the business, but do not support performance analysis. For example, one system supports the definition of a goal hierarchy for a process <ref> [25] </ref>. This system then statically evaluates this goal hierarchy to verify that all the goals are being satisfied by the process. Semantic verification is important because reengineers need to verify that the 9 process design they select satisfies the semantic goals of the business.

Reference-contexts: Much of the current process redesign is performed using informal reengineering teams (see [7, 11, 13, 35] for illustrative descriptions, [5, 12, 32, 34] for case studies, and <ref> [8, 30, 38] </ref> for redesign data management systems 2 ). Informal process redesign permits the reengineers a great deal of flexibility in decision making, but the complexity of process interactions caused by competition for resources makes it difficult to identify business problems.

Reference-contexts: This evaluation algorithm prevents: (1) the values of previously optimized parameters from becoming worse than their goal and (2) the values of other goal parameters from becoming worse than their limits. 22 7.9 Select Operators The PRS uses a best-first search algorithm augmented with a simulated annealing capability <ref> [31] </ref>. The best-first search algorithm is used because it is the most flexible search algorithm that can utilize the operator evaluations computed in the previous section.

Reference-contexts: Current simulation-based and knowledge-based systems help reengineers to better understand processes, identify certain business problems, and evaluate modification options. However, these systems do not directly assist the reengineer in generating solutions to these problems. In simulation-based redesign <ref> [2, 3, 4, 24, 33] </ref>, the reengineers are required to build a formal, executable model of the business. This model is simulated to help identify performance problems and evaluate suggested modification options. <p> Simulation-based and knowledge-based analysis systems identify two important types of problems to solve (or prevent). We describe how these systems have motivated the problem identification capabilities we have built into the PRS. Simulation-based analysis systems <ref> [2, 3, 4, 24, 33] </ref> identify performance problems in the business (i.e., primarily problems affecting its response time performance). Identification of performance problems is done using either sensitivity analysis (see [2] for an example) or performance metrics for specific problems (see [4]).

This model is simulated to help identify performance problems and evaluate suggested modification options. Knowledge-based redesign <ref> [25, 37, 39] </ref> involves the construction of semantic models that enable the reengineers to assess the semantic impact of modifications. In both of these approaches, the reengi-neers must suggest the modification options for resolving any business problems. <p> However, this metric does identify problems where there is a high potential for improvement. In our methodology, we use such metrics to help narrow down the search for modification options that are likely to have the most impact in meeting the goals. Knowledge-based analysis systems <ref> [25, 37, 39] </ref> assist reengineers in identifying semantic problems in the business, but do not support performance analysis. For example, one system supports the definition of a goal hierarchy for a process [25].
