As we demonstrate in a subsequent section, even with the loop-detection scheme of CBT <ref> [1] </ref>, transient loops can be created in the mul-ticast tree. This can lead to replicates of data packets loading the network links used by the multicast tree. The data packets sent unicast towards the core of a tree by a source can also suffer from loops and be delayed.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Multicast service in WANs has been achieved by extending two common routing algorithms used by network layer routers, i.e., distance-vector and link-state algorithms <ref> [2] </ref>. This service enables sources to send a single copy of a message to a special address that represents a set of destinations, and the message is delivered to each destination in the set. Based on Deering's work [2], the TCP/IP suite constructs multicast delivery trees on-demand [6, 8]. <p> routing algorithms used by network layer routers, i.e., distance-vector and link-state algorithms <ref> [2] </ref>. This service enables sources to send a single copy of a message to a special address that represents a set of destinations, and the message is delivered to each destination in the set. Based on Deering's work [2], the TCP/IP suite constructs multicast delivery trees on-demand [6, 8]. For example, the Multicast Backbone, MBone, in today's Internet consists of a set of routers running DVMRP. However, there are several shortcomings with the existing IP architecture for multicast routing. <p> This may lead downstream routers to think that the RP is down, to look up an alternate possibly distal RP, and to start sending joins to the other RP. 3 Multicast and network models Like CBT and PIM, SIMP adopts the host group multicast model <ref> [2] </ref>, which is used in the existing IP architecture. The model defines the service interface to the users of the internetwork. <p> Any sender can send to a group, whether or not it is a member of the group. The number and location of members in a group can be arbitrary and dynamic. The membership of different groups may also overlap. A protocol (e.g., IGMP <ref> [2] </ref>) is assumed for the routers to monitor the presence of group members on their attached subnetworks and to propagate and exchange multicast information.

Reference-contexts: All message arrivals, link failures and recoveries, link-cost changes, are processed one at a time and in the order of their occurrence. 4 Overview of SIMP SIMP is based on diffusing computations <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. A router initiates a computation by sending queries to its neighbors and waits for replies from the neighbors to detect termination. A query specifies a computation requested from the receiving router. A query or a reply may have additional information germane to the particular computation requested.

Reference-contexts: The next section presents examples of looping problems in CBT and PIM. Section 3 describes the multicast and network models used in SIMP. Section 4 gives an overview of SIMP. A detailed description and verification of SIMP is given elsewhere <ref> [7] </ref>. 2 Looping problems in CBT and PIM 2.1 Looping in CBT In CBT, the initiator of a group selects a set of core routers. The identity of all cores, which are explicitly ranked, is communicated to all cores by the initiator. <p> The Prune computation is used by a leaf router on the tree to remove itself from the multicast tree. In this paper, we have enough space to only describe source-initiated tree construction in SIMP. The complete description is given elsewhere <ref> [7] </ref>. The source-initiated tree construction is well-suited for small groups, where it is manageable for the source to know the identity of the receivers. A good example of such application is video conferencing, which will ordinarily involve fewer than hundreds of sites.

Reference-contexts: The shared tree imposes a hard constraint on the optimality of routes to all receivers from multiple sources. Furthermore, the communication traffic of different sources for a group tends to concentrate on a few links in a network <ref> [9] </ref>, further decreasing the capacity of a network. The tree is rooted ad hoc at a special router called the core. The optimality of routes can suffer from poor selection of cores.
