Abstract: The paper gives an automated procedure to design rational decimation compression systems that resample two-dimensional bandpass signals at their Nyquist rates. Our procedure takes a sketch of the desired bandpass shape in the frequency domain, circumscribes it with a parallelogram of minimal area, and linearly maps the minimal enclosing parallelogram onto one period of the frequency domain. From the rational matrix that performs the linear mapping, we compute the parameters of the upsampler, filter, and downsampler in the compression system. The compression system only has linear components.

Reference-contexts: In video processing, two-dimensional decimators can be used to convert sequences of images from interlaced to non-interlaced format. These decimators preserve the frequency content in a diamond-shaped (i.e., parallelogram-shaped) passband centered at zero frequency. Seismic data is sampled in position and time <ref> [1] </ref>. Data falling on position-time lines having the same slope correspond to seismic waves having the same velocity since slope = position time = velocity. Fan filters are used to pass ranges of velocities [1, 2]. If the range of passed velocities is small, the fan filters produce "narrowband" signals. <p> Seismic data is sampled in position and time [1]. Data falling on position-time lines having the same slope correspond to seismic waves having the same velocity since slope = position time = velocity. Fan filters are used to pass ranges of velocities <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. If the range of passed velocities is small, the fan filters produce "narrowband" signals. When the narrowband spectrum includes either frequency axis, the spectrum takes the shape of a periodically repeating parallelogram, as shown in Figure 1. <p> We approximated the circle with a twenty-sided polygon whose vertices were given by a simple Mathematica formula. The design procedure reported a packing efficiency of 79.2% and an 8-to-1 compression ratio. The best packing efficiency, 86.6%, is obtained by circumscribing the passband with a regular hexagon <ref> [1] </ref>. For non-linear compression, the theoretical upper limit on the compression ratio is 4, which is approximately 12.5-to-1. 5. CONCLUSION In some image, video, seismic applications, only a portion of the frequency content of the signals is impor tant. <p> One area is to include the design of the filter in the automated procedure, e.g., by adapting the procedures in [10]. A second area is to develop the theory for rational decimation systems based on a hexagonal bandpass spectrum since it would decimate circularly bandlim-ited signals more efficiently <ref> [1] </ref>. The issue of circumscribing a convex polygon bu a hexagon of minimal area is also an open research problem.

Reference-contexts: If the passband is a parallelogram centered at zero frequency whose coordinates are rational multiples of , then the corners of the parallelogram can be mapped one-to-one with the corners of the fundamental fre quency tile <ref> [6] </ref>. The one-to-one mapping, which is carried out by a rational matrix, expands the interior of the parallelogram to fill the fundamental frequency tile. <p> From the rational matrix, we can easily find the values for upsampling matrix L and the downsampling matrix M and specifications on the shape of the passband for the filter h [n] <ref> [6] </ref>. In fact, the rational matrix can always be factored to find L and M that are relatively prime [7]. If L and M are relatively prime, then efficient polyphase implementations always exist for these rational decimator designs [8].

If L and M are relatively prime, then efficient polyphase implementations always exist for these rational decimator designs [8]. <p> The 2 by 2 frequency domain is divided into a grid of (2M +1)fi (2M +1) points. An exhaustive grid search procedure to find the parallelogram would require O (M 6 N 2 ) operations. Evans and Sakarya have presented a heuristic procedure that requires O operations <ref> [7] </ref>. In this section, we derive a procedure that only requires O (N ) operations and that is optimal if the vertices of the original polygonal bandpass spectrum are rational multiples of .

Reference-contexts: The latter condition is satisfied if a designer sketches a bandpass shape using a mouse because the polygonal vertices selected will be on a frequency grid. We first find the convex hull of the input polygon, e.g. by using the Graham Scan method <ref> [11] </ref>. Next, we find the parallelogram of minimal area that contains convex hull (polygon).

Reference-contexts: We first find the convex hull of the input polygon, e.g. by using the Graham Scan method [11]. Next, we find the parallelogram of minimal area that contains convex hull (polygon). At the heart of finding the min imal enclosing parallelogram is our proof given in <ref> [12] </ref> that (1) two adjacent sides of the minimal enclosing parallelogram overlap with two of the edges of convex polygon, and (2) the other two adjacent sides of the minimal en-closing parallelogram intersect the convex poly gon at two of the convex polygon vertices. <p> The pair (e; v) is called an antipodal pair of C if l e and and l v support C. Using this terminology, we have proven in <ref> [12] </ref> that there is a parallelogram P C such that for both of its axes l 1 and l 2 , the intersection with C consists of an antipodal pair. <p> If z 1 &lt; N , then advance z 1 by one and go to step 1; otherwise, stop. Enclosing Parallelogram of a Convex Polygon <ref> [12] </ref> We ran the design procedure on a circular passband of radius 1. We approximated the circle with a twenty-sided polygon whose vertices were given by a simple Mathematica formula. The design procedure reported a packing efficiency of 79.2% and an 8-to-1 compression ratio.

Reference-contexts: The issue of circumscribing a convex polygon bu a hexagon of minimal area is also an open research problem. A third area of future research is to extend this procedure to multiple channels to design perfectly reconstructing two-dimensional filter banks <ref> [13, 14] </ref> based on tiling the frequency domain into different convex polygon shapes.
