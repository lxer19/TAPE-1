Abstract: A Comparison Result and Elliptic Equations Abstract It is well known that good bounds for solutions of nonlinear differential equations are difficult to obtain. In this paper, we establish a theorem comparing non-negative solutions (having identical initial values) of the equations u 00 (t) + q(t)u p (t) + r(t)u(t) = 0 and v 00 (t) + k(t)q(t)v p (t) + r(t)u(t) = 0, respectively. If q(t); r(t) 0, k(t) 1, k(t) is nondecreasing, and the first equation satisfies a certain uniqueness criterion, our result asserts that u(t) v(t). Both the uniqueness assumption on the equation and the monotonicity requirement on k(t) are necessary. A particular case of this theorem plays a central role in a recent paper of Atkinson and Peletier in the study of asymptotic behavior of nonlinear elliptic equations involving a critical exponent. A simple corollary of our result provides information on the same type of equations with subcritical exponents.

Reference-contexts: An application to nonlinear elliptic equations involving subcritical exponents gives results analogous to those of Brezis and Nirenberg for the critical exponent case. These results have been obtained previously using the variational approach, see for example, Ambrosetti and Rabinowitz <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> The variational approach has 16 been successfully applied to the subcritical case to answer this question. See, for example, the work of Ambrosetti and Rabinowitz <ref> [1] </ref>. The shooting method of Atkinson and Peletier provides an alternative. In fact, in the case of p being subcritical, the extension of their key lemma as given by Theorem 2 is all we need.

Reference-contexts: In their paper <ref> [2] </ref>, Atkinson and Peletier studied the location of the largest zero of certain solutions of the nonlinear equation v 00 + t 4 v 5 + v q This equation arises in the study of radially symmetric solutions of the semilin ear elliptic equation u + u 5 + u q <p> Even in the particular case when this coefficient is a power of t, this power does not have to be tied to one special exponent of u as in the lemma in <ref> [2] </ref>. Second, the two solutions, u (t) and v (t), can be compared starting from any initial point t = a, finite or not. The exponent (2k 3) that appears in (1.18) is the well-known (Sobolev) critical exponent for the Emden-Fowler equation. <p> Rewriting (3.3) as v 00 (t) + v p (t) we bring it into the form of (2.25), with k (t) = f (v (t))=v p (t). Theorem 1 now applies. As pointed out in <ref> [2] </ref>, all functions of the form f (u) = u p + u q , or more generally f (u) = P i u q i , with 0 &lt; q; q i &lt; p; ; i &gt; 0 satisfy (3.1). 15 Let denote the unit ball in R n . <p> For all values of n, the cutoff value of q for the first case is n=(n 2), whereas for n = 3, the value q = 1 is in a separate category by itself. An alternative approach using ordinary differential equation methods was adopted in <ref> [2] </ref> to reconfirm and to refine the results of Brezis and Nirenberg. It is known that any solution of the eigenvalue problem must be radially symmetric. Thus we are really dealing with an ordinary differential equation. <p> The situation is more complicated for larger values of p. So far most of the knowledge is derived from numerical computation. The number of solutions can be read from the graph plotting ff against or b (ff), the so-called bifurcation diagram. Atkinson and Peletier <ref> [2] </ref> proved that when 2 &lt; n &lt; 4, p is critical, and 1 &lt; q &lt; (6n)=(n2), there are at least two solutions for each large b (ff).

Reference-contexts: This is one of the important facts used in the shooting method; see, for example, Bandle and Kwong <ref> [3] </ref>. As the example comprising (1.10) and (1.11) shows, the expected result is not true unless some extra conditions on the coefficient are imposed. The following simple lemma reveals the connection between the existence of a comparison result and the uniqueness of certain positive boundary value problems.

Reference-contexts: Almost all of the other solutions of (1.18) do not have a simple closed form. Equation (1.18) is a special case of the classical Emden-Fowler equation made famous by Bellman's 3 book <ref> [4] </ref> and Wong's survey paper [14].

The first boundary condition in (2.6) is interpreted as the usual Dirichlet condition u (a) = 0 if it happens that U (a) = 0. Coffman <ref> [5] </ref> initiated the study of the uniqueness of ground-state boundary value problems via the first variational equation. The central question is to establish uniqueness of solutions to boundary value problems for the more general equation (1.7), under suitable conditions on the coefficient q (t). We sketch the ideas below. <p> Brezis and Nirenberg in <ref> [5] </ref> studied the nonlinear eigenvalue problem u + u p + u q = 0 in ; (3:7) with Dirichlet boundary condition u = 0 on @; (3:8) where 1 &lt; q &lt; p = n + 2 .

Let w (t; ff) be defined as w (t; ff) = @ff and let B = B (ff) denote the first zero of u (t; ff). <p> It is not hard to see that the same proof shows that (2.1) satisfies (U) for any s and any interval. The only other uniqueness criterion available in the literature is a generic one that works for any superlinear equation, given in <ref> [9] </ref> as an improvement of an earlier result of Coffman. In the next lemma we summarize the known uniqueness criterion and a couple of new ones, the proof of which will appear elsewhere.

It follows that there are values of b (ff) or for which there are at least three distinct solutions. A similar phenomenon was observed by Ni and Nussbaum <ref> [13] </ref> when p is supercritical and q is subcritical. As p is further reduced, numerical evidence indicates that the doublefold curve gradually unfolds; below a certain threshold, depending on q, the bifurcation curve becomes strictly monotone, and uniqueness for the boundary value problems for all b (ff) is regained.
