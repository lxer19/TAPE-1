Abstract: Traditional computer network protocols use packet switching to provide data transportation service to the user. We are developing a new connection oriented network service which separates control and data called Dynamic synchronous transfer mode, DTM. This paper presents the mechanisms and the control slots for the DTM protocol. It also describes the procedures of the protocol entity. Each node in the DTM network uses a broadcast channel to send all medium access information to the other nodes on the link.

Reference-contexts: End of frame bit: identifies the end of a segmented control packet. 4. Address: the address to a node consists of 37 bits. (32 bits corresponds to the IP address, 1 bit for each byte and the last bit is the bit for filtering). 4. see <ref> [4] </ref>, The DTM Service Specification.

Called DSAP field: identifier of the called users port (sap). 7. Start slot: identifies the first slot in the cycle that contains data to the receiver. 8. <p> The data transfer is implemented in hardware, it guarantees the bandwidth throughout the connection and gives constant delay and jitter. 5. see <ref> [4] </ref>, The DTM Service Specificartion DTM_Disc.Ind DTM_Disc.Req DR DPDU DC DPDU DTM_Disc.Ind DR DPDU DC DPDU DTM_Disc.Conf DTM_Disc.Req DTM_Disc.Conf 0 64 USER DATA DTM Protocol Specification DTM-Protocol-specification 16 TRITA-IT-9302 2.6.4 Time Sequence Diagram The time sequence diagrams describe the relationship between the service primitives and the DTM protocol data units.

Reference-contexts: It consists of one bit. REF Reference field corresponds to the start slot number from the CR DPDU that established the channel. Referred to as the CEP in <ref> [9] </ref>. FB Fiber bit. Identifies which fiber on the dual bus that is referenced i.e. the x+ or the x- fiber. The x+ fiber (upstream) is identified by a binary 1 and the x- fiber (downstream) is identified by a binary 0. It consists of 1 bit. <p> The x+ fiber (upstream) is identified by a binary 1 and the x- fiber (downstream) is identified by a binary 0. It consists of 1 bit. NR_SLOT Identifies the amount of bandwidth needed for the connection i.e. the 3. See Software Implementation of the DTM Protocol <ref> [9] </ref> for further explanation.
