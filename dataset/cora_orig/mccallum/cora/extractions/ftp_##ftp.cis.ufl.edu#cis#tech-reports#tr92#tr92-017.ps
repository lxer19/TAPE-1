Reference-contexts: This DAG is refered to as the elimination DAG. The unsymmetric-pattern exploited by the method can result in parts of the unfactored sub-matrix of a frontal matrix to be assembled into multiple later frontal matrices. In symmetric multifrontal methods <ref> [3] </ref> the assembly will be into only one later frontal matrix.

Reference-contexts: When the additional assumption of sparsity can be made, algorithmic modifications are possible that can significantly enhance execution times. Dr. Tim Davis, working with Dr. Iain Duff, has developed a very promising algorithm for solving such systems of linear equations <ref> [4] </ref>. Their method focuses on large, sparse, nonsingular systems that have an unsymmetric nonzero pattern. A most significant aspect of the method is the potential it has for parallel implementation. Current implementations of the method operate on sequential and vectorized processors. Parallel implementations are upcoming. <p> The results of the analysis just outlined illustrate a strong potential for parallelism with practical and realizable processor set sizes. 3 Chapter 2 Background This section briefly overviews some of the basic concepts of the unsymmetric-pattern multi-frontal method <ref> [4] </ref>. 2.1 LU Factorization LU factorization is a numerical algorithm based on Gaussian elimination for solving square, nonsingular systems of linear equations of the form: Ax = b, where A is an n by n real matrix and x; b are n dimensional real column vectors [7]. <p> The entire method is implemented in the analysis-factor version. Within this larger version these steps typically account for over fifty percent of the method's execution time <ref> [4] </ref>. The limited scope of this effort allows the assumption of an existing and static elimination DAG.

Reference-contexts: They represent a cross section of the type of elimination DAGs that are generated. The matrices are from the Harwell-Boeing set and each matrix comes from a real problem <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the fourth term defines the updating of the active submatrix which is essentially the carrying out of the necessary row operations needed to reduce the matrix. These models are very similar to an earlier effort by Duff and Johnsson <ref> [6] </ref> that focused on the elimination trees produced by symmetric-pattern, multifrontal methods. <p> In this model, more processors are used and a maximal amount of parallelism exploited. Assembly is done for each element in parallel. However, in order to maintain consistency with the earlier work of Johnsson and Duff <ref> [6] </ref>, a CREW 9 memory is used by this model and the assembly of contributions to an entry from multiple sons is done via a parallel prefix computation using the associative operator of addition. <p> However, the speed ups obtained are actually much better than this expectation. This is consistent with the results of the earlier study by Duff and Johnsson <ref> [6] </ref>. Another interesting, but expected, observation is that the speed ups for models 0, 3, and 4 correlate strongly with the depth ratio presented earlier. Likewise, models 1, 2, 3, and 4 correlate strongly with average node weight.

LU factorization is the most common and appropriate method for solving such systems when the only assumptions that can be made of the coefficient matrix are that it is square and nonsingular. <p> the unsymmetric-pattern multi-frontal method [4]. 2.1 LU Factorization LU factorization is a numerical algorithm based on Gaussian elimination for solving square, nonsingular systems of linear equations of the form: Ax = b, where A is an n by n real matrix and x; b are n dimensional real column vectors <ref> [7] </ref>. Specifically, the coefficient matrix, A, is factored into the product of two triangular matrices: A = LU . L is unit lower triangular and consists of the row multipliers used to reduce A to echelon form. U is the echelon form of A which is upper triangular.
