Reference-contexts: In a certain sense, this decomposition preserves the masking properties, in this special case the obvious property of the 1-SA P not to be able to mask any odd bit error sequence. It should be mentioned that some properties of the parity are presented in the paper <ref> [C] </ref>. By the result M5, a classification of signature analyzers according to their ability to mask error sequences of any odd weigth, becomes very easy.

Reference-contexts: Then the result M5 is based on the decomposition of S into the parity 1-SA P which has the characteristic polynomial x+1, and some other (n-1)-SA S' (cf. <ref> [Gi] </ref> or [VP] for more details). In a certain sense, this decomposition preserves the masking properties, in this special case the obvious property of the 1-SA P not to be able to mask any odd bit error sequence. <p> Register graph G V 4 Autonomous graph A V 4 12 In general, the structure of the remaining components of the autonomous graph A S depends widely on the characteristic polynomial of the SA. We present here only some special properties; more results and proofs can be found in <ref> [Gi] </ref>, and [VP], for example. G 1 . <p> This can be done using the notion of the cycle set which contains informations on the number of cycles and their lengthes. The definition and further properties of cycle sets can be found in <ref> [Gi] </ref>, [L], and [VP]. With regard to our problem of masking of odd weight error sequences by any non-degenerated SA S, it is important to know how the cycles of A S are connected by 1 edges of the register graph G S , from the following reason.

Reference-contexts: Some of the results are simple consequences of Smith's theorem but some of them have been published earlier (in some cases without any proof). The first example of a result of this kind has in essence already been presented in [Fr] (announced yet earlier in <ref> [GN] </ref>) as an big advantage of signature analysis against transition counting. It should be remarked that the condition to be nontrivial has been mentioned only by Smith in 1980. M3. If the SA S is nontrivial then masking of error sequences having the weight 1 by S is impossible.

Reference-contexts: Firstly we will consider error sequences of even weights; this case is in fact far less interesting than the other one. 8 The following property has been conjectured in [L] and proved in <ref> [G] </ref>.

We already mentioned in Section 2 that such automata can be applied to perform a parallel data compression.

In particular for diagnosis methods of the latter kind but also in other cases (if a fault isolation is based on 'fault dictionaries', for example), the amount of the diagnostic data can be too large such that the evaluation of the test responses would become very inefficient.

Reference-contexts: In this report, we restricted our attention only to LFSRs but also other linear devices are commonly considered as generators of signature-like data compressions. The following linear automaton is well known as a division circuit, and it is applied especially in coding theory (cf. <ref> [PW] </ref>, for example). On the other hand, there are also applications in signature analysis; some basic properties, and the relationsbetween these automata and LFSRs are studied in [VP].

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, some different or extended or more special (the latter one for particular kinds of circuits) fault models, respectively, are also considered in the literature of testing. More information can be found in <ref> [R] </ref>, Chapter 3. The aim of testing consists in 'stimulating' the inputs of the DUT in such a manner than many internal fault (defined by the fault model) will be detected by some corresponding output values which are said to be the test responses. <p> In general, the length of the test input sequences will increase if the DUT will become more complex. For practical applications, there are some rules ('design for testability'; cf. <ref> [R] </ref>, Chapter 5, or, in particular, [WP], for example) concerning the circuit design which should lead to an easier testing. As an important example, we mention the modularity where some smaller parts of the DUT could be tested either exhaustively or randomly. <p> Such devices are commonly referred to be Built-In Self-Test tools (BIST, for short, cf. <ref> [R] </ref>, Chapter 5, or, in particular, [MC1], [MC2], for example).

Reference-contexts: In this case the fault will not be detected by signature analysis, and this situation has been termed masking , or, in other references, aliasing . In many articles, starting with the papers [BCA], [F], [D], [KMZ], and <ref> [S] </ref>, for example, various results about masking have been published. The study of masking in signature analysis is based on an interesting mathematical background, in algebra and probability theory as well as in automata and graph theory. <p> The first one includes more general masking results which are based either on the characteristic polynomial or on other SA properties. 7 We illustrate this kind of studies by one example; the following fundamental result was firstly presented in <ref> [S] </ref>: M 1 . Any error sequence E=(e 1 ,...,e t ) is masked by an SA S if and only if its error polynomial p E (x) = e 1 x t-1 +...+e t-1 x+e t is divisible by the characteristic polynomial p S (x). <p> The third direction in studies on masking contains qualitative results concerning the general possibility or impossibility of SAs to mask error sequences of some special type. Examples of such a type (considered already in <ref> [S] </ref>) are burst errors, or sequences with fixed errorsensitive positions. Traditionally, error sequences having some fixed weight are also regarded as such a special type, where the weight w (E) of some binary sequence E is simply its number of ones.

Reference-contexts: Whichtypes of binary patterns can be in fact generated by signature analyzers as their reduced transition graphs? This problem is widely open; some first simulation results can be found in the conference paper <ref> [Vo] </ref>. 4. Concluding remarks 1. The important problem of the computation or estimation of masking probabilities has only been mentioned some times in this report.

Let S be any n-stage SA. Then the transition graph T S consists of the set of all cycles of the autonomous graph A S as its vertex set, and of the edge set specified as follows. <p> It should be of some interest to develop more efficient LFSR simulation algorithms to obtain further and better simulation results. It must be mentioned here that one theorem (Satz 31, concerning isomorphisms between transition graphs) published in the book <ref> [VP] </ref> has been disproved by one of the very first running simulation programs! By the simulations based on this program we realized that there are different products of irreducible polynomials of the degrees 3 and 6 which lead to non-isomorphic transition graphs of the resulting 9-SAs.
