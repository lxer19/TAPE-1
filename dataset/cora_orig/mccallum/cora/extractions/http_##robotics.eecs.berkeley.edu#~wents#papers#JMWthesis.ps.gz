Reference-contexts: Many researchers have attacked the problem of multibody simulation and many books have been written on the subject (for a sampling, see (Schiehlen, 1993), (de Jalon and Bayo, 1994), (Shabana, 1989), and <ref> (Amirouche, 1992) </ref>). Multibody systems require special techniques to deal with the complex equations of motion and require computer algorithms for efficient simulation. However, there is a lack of mechanical integrators for multibody systems and certain applications suffer from a lack of good simulation tools.

Reference-contexts: Differential-algebraic-equation (DAE) techniques treat multibody systems as a collection of differential equations and algebraic constraints. Several DAE integrators have been created (for example, MEXX (Lubich et al., 1993), DASSL (Petzold, 1982), (Bre-nan et al., 1989), and MBSSIM <ref> (Andrzejewski et al., 1993) </ref>. Also see (Schiehlen, 1993) for additional references). These methods seem natural for systems with closed-loops and by exploiting sparsity in matrices can also achieve linear-time computational cost for tree-structured multibody systems.

Reference-contexts: Recursive algorithms are 111 one class of techniques that calculate the joint accelerations of tree-structured systems with a computational cost that grows linearly with the number of joints (see Chapter 3, (Featherstone, 1983), (Jain, 1991), and <ref> (Bae and Haug, 1987) </ref>). These algorithms are well-suited for tree-structured systems, and the techniques have been extended to systems with closed loops (see (Bae and Haug, 1988) and (Rodriguez et al., 1992)).

Reference-contexts: Some of the Literature. This chapter uses the discrete variational principle presented in (Veselov, 1988) and again in (Veselov, 1991) and (Moser and Veselov, 1991). It is shown in (Veselov, 1988) that the DEL equations preserve a symplectic form. The same discrete mechanics procedure is derived in <ref> (Baez and Gilliam, 1995) </ref> using an algebraic approach, and they also show that there is a discrete Noether's theorem for infinitesimal symmetry. Various authors have proposed versions of discrete mechanics. Some study discrete mechanics without the motivation of constructing integration schemes while this is a definite motivation for other authors. <p> The evolution equations are called the discrete Euler-Lagrange (DEL) equations. The results in this and the next section have appeared in (Veselov, 1988), (Veselov, 1991), (Moser and Veselov, 1991) and in <ref> (Baez and Gilliam, 1995) </ref> but are rederived here in a consistent notation for completeness and clarity. Given a configuration space, Q, a discrete Lagrangian is a map L : Q fi Q ! R .

Reference-contexts: The authors in (Cremer and Stewart, 1989) created Newton as a general purpose multibody simulator with contact. Impulse (Mirtich, 1996) is a recent multibody simulator that uses recursive algorithms and models contact with impulses. The author in <ref> (Baraff, 1996) </ref> created a multibody simulator with contact by utilizing DAE algorithms and by exploiting sparsity to obtain linear-time complexity for tree-structured multibody systems. These simulators have applications in animation, computer graphics, and engineering design. 112 Modeling contact efficiently and robustly is difficult to achieve for general purpose multibody simulators. <p> One must also detect contact with collision detection algorithms, and evolve the system while in contact. The main approaches to date are impulsive contact models (Mirtich, 1996), solving a linear complementarity problem (LCP) (Trinkle et al., 1997), <ref> (Baraff, 1996) </ref>, (Pfeiffer and Glocker, 1996), and using a spring-based method (Goyal et al., 1994a), (Goyal et al., 1994b). See (Mirtich, 1996) and (Brogliato, 1996) for a more in depth discussion of contact modeling.

Reference-contexts: The 44 45 fluctuations in energy appear to be related to the constraint forces. The middle graph is a plot of the multipliers versus time, and the fluctuations in the multipliers are correlated to the fluctuations in energy. This relationship has also been noticed in <ref> (Barth and Leimkuhler, 1996a) </ref>, and they use variable step size to decrease the energy oscillation. 2.5 Chapter Summary In this chapter, a general approach to discrete mechanics was formulated and developed. A general method to construct symplectic-momentum mechanical integrators for Lagrangian systems with holonomic constraints was then presented.

Reference-contexts: For another treatment of algorithms formed by embedding the constraint manifold in a linear space, see <ref> (Barth and Leimkuhler, 1996b) </ref>. See (Leimkuhler and Patrick, 1996) for a treatment of symplectic integration on Riemannian manifolds. The algorithm presented in this chapter also embeds the constraint manifold in a linear space but only enforces position constraints. Contributions. <p> For tree-structured multibody systems, it is shown in Section 5.4 that the linear equations involving the Jacobian can be solved in linear time. The authors in <ref> (Barth and Leimkuhler, 1996b) </ref> particulate the rigid bodies in a multibody system with point masses. They then use symplectic-momentum integrators with constraints and general sparse matrix techniques to simulate multibody systems. <p> It is important in some applications that these properties are obeyed by the numerical integration scheme. For example, in space applications, momentum conservation is critical. For long-term simulations of Hamiltonian systems, symplectic integration seems important. The authors in <ref> (Barth and Leimkuhler, 1996b) </ref> particulate the rigid bodies in a multibody system with point masses. They then use symplectic-momentum integrators with constraints and general sparse matrix techniques to 113 simulate multibody systems. The author in (Reich, 1996b) uses the methods in (Reich, 1996a) to create symplectic-momentum integrators for multibody systems.

Reference-contexts: These algorithms are well-suited for tree-structured systems, and the techniques have been extended to systems with closed loops (see (Bae and Haug, 1988) and (Rodriguez et al., 1992)). Recursive techniques with closed-loops often use Baumgarte's stabilization technique (PD controllers enforcing the constraints) <ref> (Baumgarte, 1972) </ref> to counteract drifting in the loop closure constraints. Differential-algebraic-equation (DAE) techniques treat multibody systems as a collection of differential equations and algebraic constraints.

Reference-contexts: In the simulations, energy is used as a monitor to catch any obvious problems, as in (Channell and Scovel, 1990) and (Simo and Gonzalez, 1993). For a discussion of 31 circumstances under which this can be justified, see (Sanz-Serna, 1991)(page 277-278), (Sanz-Serna and Calvo, 1994)(page 139-140), and <ref> (Benettin and Giorgilli, 1994) </ref>. In general, energy conservation alone does not imply good performance as is shown in (Ortiz, 1986). In the DSP example, energy is observed to oscillate around a constant value, which is taken as a good indication.

Reference-contexts: Improvements can be made to the balancing controller. The current controller is model-based and does not adapt to changes in the model parameters. Adaptation may be used to react to loads as well as correct for modeling errors. See <ref> (Berghuis, 1993) </ref> for a study of model-based robot controllers with and without adaptation. This controller is not designed to operate near singularities. For example, the leg is at a singularity when the knee joint angle is at zero degrees.

Reference-contexts: One may proceed analogously to the derivation in this paper to create energy-momentum integrators possibly based on discretizing the principle of least action. Nonholonomic Systems. The method presented in this paper treats holonomic constraints and one would like to generalize the method to treat nonholonomic constraints, as in <ref> (Bloch et al., 1996) </ref>. For nonholonomic systems, the standard symplectic form is not preserved, and there are momentum equations and not conservation laws. Also, energy can 47 be conserved in these systems. One has to develop algorithms taking into account these effects. Multistep Methods, Stages, and Time Step Control.

In some applications, curvature of the contact interaction may be important as is discussed in (Rimon and Bur-dick, 1994). Contact simulation is important in some finite element applications, e.g., car crash simulations.

Reference-contexts: Symplectic, momentum and energy conserving schemes for the rigid body are presented in (Lewis and Simo, 1995).

Reference-contexts: In the forward dynamics problem, the joint accelerations are determined given the positions, velocities, torques, and external forces. Recursive algorithms are derived in this dissertation using Lie group notation and the crucial concepts of articulated body (AB) inertias and bias forces introduced in <ref> (Featherstone, 1983) </ref>. The AB inertia and bias force concepts are introduced followed by a derivation of the recursive algorithms.

The development in this chapter is influenced by the work in (Featherstone, 1983), (Jain, 1991), (Lilly, 1993), and (Mirtich, 1996). Effectively, the recursive forward dynamics algorithms solve the linear system involving the mass matrix in linear-time as opposed to the cubic-time required for solving linear systems with LU decomposition. <p> The forward dynamics algorithm calculates the joint accelerations given the joint torques, external forces, positions, and velocities. The algorithm is based on the concept of articulated body (AB) inertias and bias forces presented in <ref> (Featherstone, 1983) </ref>.

This stage calculates the articulated body (AB) inertia <ref> (Featherstone, 1983) </ref> and bias forces of the inboard link based on the AB inertia and bias forces of the outboard link. <p> The AB inertia and bias force for the central body provide the approximate workspace dynamics. AB inertias and bias forces are discussed in many references including <ref> (Featherstone, 1983) </ref>, (Lilly, 1993), (Jain, 1991), (Mirtich, 1996), and in Chapter 3 of this dissertation. The recursive workspace controller assumes that the feet are fixed to the floor. We approximate this condition from a big base assumption presented in (Lilly, 1993). <p> The algorithm calculates the articulated body (AB) inertia <ref> (Featherstone, 1983) </ref> and bias forces of the inboard link based on the AB inertia and bias force of the outboard link. The AB inertia and bias forces for the central body are calculated in the last step in the iteration. The calculations are given in Algorithm 4.3. <p> Researchers have been studying multibody simulation techniques for many years and have created several techniques for computer simulation. Recursive algorithms are 111 one class of techniques that calculate the joint accelerations of tree-structured systems with a computational cost that grows linearly with the number of joints (see Chapter 3, <ref> (Featherstone, 1983) </ref>, (Jain, 1991), and (Bae and Haug, 1987)). These algorithms are well-suited for tree-structured systems, and the techniques have been extended to systems with closed loops (see (Bae and Haug, 1988) and (Rodriguez et al., 1992)).

Reference-contexts: It is known that if the energy and momentum map include all the integrals from a certain class (depending on the smoothness available), then one cannot create integrators that are symplectic, energy preserving, and momentum preserving unless they coincidentally integrate the equations exactly up to a time parameterization (see <ref> (Ge and Marsden, 1988) </ref> for the exact statement). Thus, mechanical integrators divide into two overall classes, symplectic-momentum and energy-momentum integrators.

Gymnastics were also performed with the hopping robot, and this work is documented in <ref> (Hodgins and Raibert, 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The discrete mechanics approach in (Veselov, 1988) is adopted in this dissertation. Some authors discretize the principle of least action instead of Hamilton's principle. Algorithms that conserve the Hamiltonian are derived in <ref> (Itoh and Abe, 1988) </ref> based on difference quotients. Differentiation is not used and the action is extremized using variational difference quotients. This development presents multistep methods with variable time steps. The least action principle is discretized in a different way in (Shibberu, 1994).

Reference-contexts: The AB inertia and bias force concepts are introduced followed by a derivation of the recursive algorithms. The development in this chapter is influenced by the work in (Featherstone, 1983), <ref> (Jain, 1991) </ref>, (Lilly, 1993), and (Mirtich, 1996). Effectively, the recursive forward dynamics algorithms solve the linear system involving the mass matrix in linear-time as opposed to the cubic-time required for solving linear systems with LU decomposition. <p> The fac torization is based on the factorization for serial chains in <ref> (Jain, 1991) </ref> and differs from the factorization of tree-structured systems in (Rodriguez et al., 1992). The block adjoint matrix, A, is composed of block matrices A kl 2 R 6fi6 where A kl = &gt; &gt; &lt; A k 0 6fi6 otherwise. <p> The matrix T maps body wrenches into the wrenches across each joint. The matrix H T maps body wrenches across the joints to joint torques. 63 Again, the factorization presented here is based on the derivations for serial chains in <ref> (Jain, 1991) </ref>. The factorization presented in this dissertation is for tree-structured multi-body systems and is derived using the Lie group notation used in this dissertation. A similar factorization to the one presented here is given in (Park et al., 1995). <p> The forward dynamics algorithm calculates the joint accelerations given the joint torques, external forces, positions, and velocities. The algorithm is based on the concept of articulated body (AB) inertias and bias forces presented in (Featherstone, 1983). The derivation is primarily based on the work in (Featherstone, 1983), <ref> (Jain, 1991) </ref>, (Lilly, 1993), and (Mirtich, 1996). <p> Lie group matrix notation presented in (Murray et al., 1994) was used and this simplified the derivation and correctly provided the coordinate changes necessary to implement the algorithms. A factorization of the equations of motion was provided based on the work in <ref> (Jain, 1991) </ref>. Consult (Jain, 1991) for additional factorizations, operators, and interpretations of the recursive algorithms.

AB inertias and bias forces are discussed in many references including (Featherstone, 1983), (Lilly, 1993), <ref> (Jain, 1991) </ref>, (Mirtich, 1996), and in Chapter 3 of this dissertation. The recursive workspace controller assumes that the feet are fixed to the floor. We approximate this condition from a big base assumption presented in (Lilly, 1993). <p> Recursive algorithms are 111 one class of techniques that calculate the joint accelerations of tree-structured systems with a computational cost that grows linearly with the number of joints (see Chapter 3, (Featherstone, 1983), <ref> (Jain, 1991) </ref>, and (Bae and Haug, 1987)). These algorithms are well-suited for tree-structured systems, and the techniques have been extended to systems with closed loops (see (Bae and Haug, 1988) and (Rodriguez et al., 1992)).

Reference-contexts: The technique uses joint trajectory data, PD controllers, and state machines to produce the behaviors. Three-dimensional running is documented in (Hodgins, 1996), and the motion is produced using PD controllers, specifying joint trajectories, and coordinating the PD controllers with state machines. Recently, the authors in <ref> (Kokkevis et al., 1996) </ref> have used model reference adaptive controllers (MRAC) to produce animations of human models in a dynamic multibody simulator. The fundamental limitation of the current control techniques for biped locomotion is that there are no general, predictive models of human motion.

Recently, a few researchers have created mechanical integrators for multibody systems. Mechanical integrators respect the structure of mechanical systems and preserve energy, momentum, and/or are symplectic. It is important in some applications that these properties are obeyed by the numerical integration scheme.

The continuous-time equations of motion also satisfy the hidden velocity constraints created by differentiating the holonomic constraints with respect to time. SHAKE does not satisfy the hidden velocity constraint. RATTLE is an extension of SHAKE and satisfies the holonomic and hidden velocity constraints.

Reference-contexts: Recursive techniques with closed-loops often use Baumgarte's stabilization technique (PD controllers enforcing the constraints) (Baumgarte, 1972) to counteract drifting in the loop closure constraints. Differential-algebraic-equation (DAE) techniques treat multibody systems as a collection of differential equations and algebraic constraints. Several DAE integrators have been created (for example, MEXX <ref> (Lubich et al., 1993) </ref>, DASSL (Petzold, 1982), (Bre-nan et al., 1989), and MBSSIM (Andrzejewski et al., 1993). Also see (Schiehlen, 1993) for additional references). These methods seem natural for systems with closed-loops and by exploiting sparsity in matrices can also achieve linear-time computational cost for tree-structured multibody systems.

Reference-contexts: New algorithms are created in this dissertation to aid in designing, prototyping, and developing controlled mechanical systems by exploiting the structure of multibody systems. Specifically, a balancing controller for a 3D multibody model of a human biped is created, and mechanical integrators (preserve energy, momentum, and/or are symplectic see <ref> (Marsden, 1992) </ref>) are created for Lagrangian systems with holonomic constraints. Multibody systems serve as a basis for many models of mechanical systems and have uses in many areas of science and engineering. Multibody models are used to analyze biological systems and human locomotion. <p> The overall situation for mechanical integrators is complex, and it is still evolving.

Reference-contexts: The controller is designed to have a small number of parameters, a large operating region, to be easy to tune, and to serve as a basis for more complicated motion: walking, running, jumping, changing direction, and adapting to loads. The system is simulated in Impulse <ref> (Mirtich, 1996) </ref> and simulation results are presented. * Chapter 5 Components of a Multibody Simulator. This chapter presents components for a multibody simulator specifically designed for the simulation of controlled multibody models of human bipeds in contact with the ground. <p> The AB inertia and bias force concepts are introduced followed by a derivation of the recursive algorithms. The development in this chapter is influenced by the work in (Featherstone, 1983), (Jain, 1991), (Lilly, 1993), and <ref> (Mirtich, 1996) </ref>. Effectively, the recursive forward dynamics algorithms solve the linear system involving the mass matrix in linear-time as opposed to the cubic-time required for solving linear systems with LU decomposition. The chapter first presents the notation used for tree-structured systems and then 50 discusses kinematics for multibody systems. <p> An example of a tree-structured multibody system and the corresponding graph is shown Figure 3.1. The rigid bodies are labeled in bold and the joints are labeled in italics. The recursive algorithms in this chapter use a joint-centric approach as is done in <ref> (Mirtich, 1996) </ref> instead of a link-centric approach. The algorithms are iterated over the joint index, and the joint-centric approach provides an elegant method to bookkeep the link to link calculations. Outboard recursion or iteration proceeds from the root to the leaves and the joint index increases. <p> The algorithm is based on the concept of articulated body (AB) inertias and bias forces presented in (Featherstone, 1983). The derivation is primarily based on the work in (Featherstone, 1983), (Jain, 1991), (Lilly, 1993), and <ref> (Mirtich, 1996) </ref>. This section presents the recursive algorithms in a consistent and concise manner with the notation used in this dissertation. 64 3.4.1 Articulated Body Inertias and Bias Forces The important concept in the recursive forward dynamics algorithms is the concept of articulated body (AB) inertias and bias forces. <p> A factorization of the equations of motion was provided based on the work in (Jain, 1991). Consult (Jain, 1991) for additional factorizations, operators, and interpretations of the recursive algorithms. The development in this chapter is influenced by the work in (Featherstone, 1983), (Jain, 1991), (Lilly, 1993), and <ref> (Mirtich, 1996) </ref> and consult these references for different derivations of recursive multibody techniques. <p> The chapter first describes the biped model and then provides an overview of the recursive workspace controller. The workspace controller is then described in more detail followed by simulation results performed in a 3D multibody simulator designed to handle contact with the environment called Impulse <ref> (Mirtich, 1996) </ref>. The derivations in this chapter assume a familiarity with the results in Appendix A and Chapter 3. 76 4.1 Description of Biped Model The 3D multibody model of the biped consists of a central body and two legs and is shown in Figure 4.1. <p> The AB inertia and bias force for the central body provide the approximate workspace dynamics. AB inertias and bias forces are discussed in many references including (Featherstone, 1983), (Lilly, 1993), (Jain, 1991), <ref> (Mirtich, 1996) </ref>, and in Chapter 3 of this dissertation. The recursive workspace controller assumes that the feet are fixed to the floor. We approximate this condition from a big base assumption presented in (Lilly, 1993). <p> Then update ~ F bd k+1 by noting that link k:o is in equilibrium for the Jacobian calculation: ~ F bd k+1 = F bd 4.3 Simulation Results The controlled multibody system is created and simulated in Impulse <ref> (Mirtich, 1996) </ref> and simulation results are presented in this section. Impulse is a multibody simulator that handles contact through impulses. <p> Researchers have also developed contact models and have combined them with multibody simulation techniques to create general purpose simulators. The authors in (Cremer and Stewart, 1989) created Newton as a general purpose multibody simulator with contact. Impulse <ref> (Mirtich, 1996) </ref> is a recent multibody simulator that uses recursive algorithms and models contact with impulses. The author in (Baraff, 1996) created a multibody simulator with contact by utilizing DAE algorithms and by exploiting sparsity to obtain linear-time complexity for tree-structured multibody systems. <p> One must also detect contact with collision detection algorithms, and evolve the system while in contact. The main approaches to date are impulsive contact models <ref> (Mirtich, 1996) </ref>, solving a linear complementarity problem (LCP) (Trinkle et al., 1997), (Baraff, 1996), (Pfeiffer and Glocker, 1996), and using a spring-based method (Goyal et al., 1994a), (Goyal et al., 1994b). See (Mirtich, 1996) and (Brogliato, 1996) for a more in depth discussion of contact modeling. <p> The main approaches to date are impulsive contact models <ref> (Mirtich, 1996) </ref>, solving a linear complementarity problem (LCP) (Trinkle et al., 1997), (Baraff, 1996), (Pfeiffer and Glocker, 1996), and using a spring-based method (Goyal et al., 1994a), (Goyal et al., 1994b). See (Mirtich, 1996) and (Brogliato, 1996) for a more in depth discussion of contact modeling. In some applications, curvature of the contact interaction may be important as is discussed in (Rimon and Bur-dick, 1994). Contact simulation is important in some finite element applications, e.g., car crash simulations. <p> These algorithms may turn out to be more efficient than current techniques and can be used in applications where the underlying structure is important. Efficiently modeling contact still needs improvement. The LCP and impulse approaches available for hard contact problems are complementary (see <ref> (Mirtich, 1996) </ref>) and combining these approaches seems to be a promising area for future research. The creators of Impulse are currently exploring this area of work. The contact model presented in this dissertation was developed as a soft contact model of the feet interacting with the ground.

The methodology in <ref> (Murray et al., 1994) </ref> is also extended from serial chains to the larger class of tree-structured multibody systems. In the forward kinematics problem, the pose, velocity, and acceleration of each rigid body in the multibody system is calculated. <p> See page 167 58 in <ref> (Murray et al., 1994) </ref> for a derivation of the rigid body equations. The equations of motion for a single rigid body in the multibody system are now derived. Let F b k:o denote the body wrench acting on link k:o from link k:i through joint k. <p> The joint accelerations are then calculated in an outboard recursion. 70 3.5 Chapter Summary Recursive techniques for the forward kinematics, inverse dynamics, and forward dynamics of tree-structured multibody systems with general joints were derived in this chapter. Lie group matrix notation presented in <ref> (Murray et al., 1994) </ref> was used and this simplified the derivation and correctly provided the coordinate changes necessary to implement the algorithms. A factorization of the equations of motion was provided based on the work in (Jain, 1991). <p> Equation (4.13) then implies that e p c _e p c e p 87 If Equation (4.14) holds, then e p c ! 0 exponentially in time. See <ref> (Murray et al., 1994) </ref> (page 192) for a proof. The position error will only converge to zero if Equation (4.6) holds, and this relies on the assumptions that the feet are fixed to the ground and that the dynamic terms of the model and the controller model are equal. <p> e p e K v e 7 5 ; (4.26) and the Jacobian for the linearization evaluated at the equilibrium, (q v e ; ! s 2 6 0 1 K R K v 3 7 If the gain matrices are positive definite and symmetric, then as is proved in <ref> (Murray et al., 1994) </ref> (page 192), the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix lie in the left hand plane. This 90 proves locally that the orientation error, q v e , converges to zero exponentially. <p> Recursive algorithms are important in the study of multibody systems. Recursive forward kinematics, inverse dynamics, and forward dynamics algorithms for tree-structured multibody systems were derived in terms of the Lie group notation used in <ref> (Murray et al., 1994) </ref>. These algorithms and the ideas in the algorithms were used in the development of the 3D balancing controller. This dissertation presented components of a multibody simulator specifically designed for developing control algorithms for human motion and for simulating human biped models in contact with the ground. <p> DAE methods seem more natural for modeling systems with closed-loops. 142 Appendix A Robotics Background A brief background in rigid body motion, quaternions, and robotics is given in this appendix. The notation used in this dissertation for rigid body motion is also presented. Consult <ref> (Murray et al., 1994) </ref> for a more detailed treatment of many of the topics.

Parameterize the joint angle by the variable . Then, g l;k () = e l;k where ~ s l;k is a constant spatial twist.

The integrator in (Reich, 1996b) is an explicit integrator which satisfies the position and velocity constraints. For real-time simulation, one is less concerned with numerical accuracy and more concerned with getting fairly accurate results with a predictable computational cost.

Also see <ref> (Schiehlen, 1993) </ref> for additional references). These methods seem natural for systems with closed-loops and by exploiting sparsity in matrices can also achieve linear-time computational cost for tree-structured multibody systems. Researchers have also developed contact models and have combined them with multibody simulation techniques to create general purpose simulators.
