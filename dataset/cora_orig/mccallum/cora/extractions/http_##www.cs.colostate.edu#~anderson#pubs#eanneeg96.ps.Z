Abstract: Neural networks are trained to classify half-second segments of six-channel, EEG data into one of five classes corresponding to five cognitive tasks performed by four subjects. Two and three-layer feedfor-ward neural networks are trained using 10-fold cross-validation and early stopping to control over-fitting. EEG signals were represented as autoregressive (AR) models. The average percentage of test segments correctly classified ranged from 71% for one subject to 38% for another subject. Cluster analysis of the resulting neural networks' hidden-unit weight vectors identifies which EEG channels are most relevant to this discrimination problem.

Reference-contexts: Iasemidis, et al., [8] for example, demonstrate that AR models of EEG during epileptic seizures fail to capture time dependencies that can be captured using new, nonparametric methods developed for analyzing chaotic signals. Fernandez, et al., <ref> [3] </ref> found significant relationships between mental tasks and features calculated as the relative power in certain frequency bands during the task minus the power during a rest period. Referencing the components of the signal representation to the rest condition might improve the performance reported in this article.

Reference-contexts: Early stopping is one of the simplest methods for limiting the complexity of a network. Other methods might lead to better generalization performance.

Reference-contexts: The most likely route to better performance is to test other EEG signal representations. Perhaps performance would be improved by replacing the linear AR predictive model with a nonlinear model and using the coefficients of the nonlinear model as the signal representation. Iasemidis, et al., <ref> [8] </ref> for example, demonstrate that AR models of EEG during epileptic seizures fail to capture time dependencies that can be captured using new, nonparametric methods developed for analyzing chaotic signals.
