Reference-contexts: In manual mode, the message filtering and transformation is done manually by the operator. The operator decides whether to pass or reject each message, and performs any desired transformation, possibly by editing or sanitizing the message. This manual mode provides much of the same capabilities as the LSI Guard <ref> [Craigen 82] </ref>. The general MFM is a design for an entire family of message flow modulators.
