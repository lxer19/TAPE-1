Reference-contexts: A rectangle is also the natural choice of a primitive shape to represent the freespace in an isothetic workspace as it is the simplest of isothetic shapes. Ahmed and Biswas <ref> [AHM90a] </ref> have devised a representation for describing such a workspace. In this representation, rectangle-based primitive corridors arise naturally and include the I-, L-, T- and X-shaped prototypical segments. <p> The motion of the robot consists of translations and rotations. The translation is restricted to the directions of the two principal axes and the rotation is about any point on the edge of the moving object [AHM90b] [SOW91]. In this setting, the freespace is modelled as overlapping rectangular regions <ref> [AHM90a] </ref>. Motion of an object through these regions is viewed as crossingovers from one region to the neighbouring region. We can think of a path from one point to another as a corridor through which the moving object manoeuvers itself.

Reference-contexts: The moving object is assumed to be a rectangle. The motion of the robot consists of translations and rotations. The translation is restricted to the directions of the two principal axes and the rotation is about any point on the edge of the moving object <ref> [AHM90b] </ref> [SOW91]. In this setting, the freespace is modelled as overlapping rectangular regions [AHM90a]. Motion of an object through these regions is viewed as crossingovers from one region to the neighbouring region. <p> Lastly, in CASE 3, the object moves using incremental translation and incremental rotation such that the moving object slides against the corridor walls, touching the 4 walls at two points, unlike earlier cases where it touches the walls only at the pivot point <ref> [AHM90b] </ref> [SOW91]. We now consider these cases of moving through an L-corridor in detail. In each case, we first consider the motion of a rigid rod through an L-corridor and then extend it to a rectangle. We compute the maximum length of the moving rectangle for a given width. <p> These prototypical situations arise due to the freespace representation in a 2-D isothethetic workspace. The solution for the L-corridor, optimized with respect to geometric constraints on the moving object and the corridor, has been given. All other cases may be dealt with using this solution; see <ref> [AHM90b] </ref> [SOW91]. In the motion strategies suggested in this paper, CASE 3 in general is the best for a given width, as far as motion of the largest sized object is concerned.

Reference-contexts: We briefly mention some efforts in this direction below. The SOFA PROBLEM, determining the largest region (or sofa) which can be moved through a 2-D corridor was originally proposed by Moser [MOS66]. In one of the early attempts, Goldberg <ref> [GOL69] </ref> and Sebastian [SEB70] considered an analytical solution to find the largest sized object that can be maneuvered through a variety of corridors. Maruyama [MAR73] gave an approximation method for solving the SOFA PROBLEM for shapes which were angularly simple polygons.

Reference-contexts: Maruyama [MAR73] gave an approximation method for solving the SOFA PROBLEM for shapes which were angularly simple polygons. He used a sequence of transformations to move the sofa through a given corridor. Howden <ref> [HOW68] </ref> used chain representation to move the largest rectangle of a given width through 1 an L-shaped corridor.

Reference-contexts: Normally, trajectory planning based on local constraints does not change a path computed by FINDPATH, since the latter would have considered all such constraints before computing the path. Freespace decomposition is one of the geometric methods employed to solve the path planning problem <ref> [HWA92] </ref>. The freespace method works in two stages. In the first stage, an appropriate representation scheme that captures the essential properties of the problem environment is devised; the second stage utilizes this representation to solve the problem at hand.

Reference-contexts: The problem of moving an object from one point to another inside a complex 2-D and 3-D workspace has been well studied <ref> [LAT91] </ref>. However moving an object in prototypical situations has not been given much attention. Often complex general solutions which address global aspects of the motion planning problem are not suitable for a simplified instance of the problem.

Reference-contexts: See Figure (7.a). To ensure that the entire the moving object remains within the corridor, the curve traced such that the rod is always tangent to the curve is important. The curve traced in this manner is called an astroid <ref> [LOC71] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Due to the geometric simplicity of the primitive shape, corridors and their connections may be categorized into a finite number of prototypical situations <ref> [MAD86] </ref>. In order to plan collision free robot motion both at FINDPATH and at trajectory planning levels, it is essential that we understand the mechanism of moving the robot through prototypical situations.

We compute the maximum length of the moving rectangle for a given width. <p> At the beginning of rotation when OE = 0, the function value is l max corresponding to the corridor size (W 1 ; W 2 ) and width of the moving object w; after the completion of the rotation when OE = 90, it linearly decreases to l <ref> [SOW91] </ref>. This linear decrease rests solely on the assumption that the rate of rotation is linearly proportional to the rate of translation. <p> These prototypical situations arise due to the freespace representation in a 2-D isothethetic workspace. The solution for the L-corridor, optimized with respect to geometric constraints on the moving object and the corridor, has been given. All other cases may be dealt with using this solution; see [AHM90b] <ref> [SOW91] </ref>.

Strang [STR82] and Yap <ref> [YAP87] </ref> have dealt with complexity theoretic analysis of moving a rigid object through a door and its generalization. Strang studied the motion of convex objects through a door in 2-D and 3-D and tried to compute the minimum width of the door which allows the passage of the object.
