Title: The 42 Equivalence Classes of Quadratic Surfaces in Affine n-Space  
Author: Jorg Peters Ulrich Reif 
Date: July 18, 1997  
Abstract: We establish an exhaustive catalogue of 42 equivalence classes of bivariate quadratic surfaces in affine n-space. Here two surfaces belong to the same class if they differ only by zero components or by affine transformations of domain and range.
