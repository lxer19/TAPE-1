Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress." Abstract IS-IS may form multiple equal cost paths between points. This is true of any link state protocol. In the absence of any explicit support to take advantage of this, a path may be chosen arbitrarily. Techniques have been utilized to divide traffic somewhat evenly among the available paths. These techniques have been referred to as Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP). An unequal division of traffic among the available paths is generally preferable. Routers generally have no knowledge of traffic loading on distant links and therefore have no basis to optimize the allocation of traffic. Optimized Mulitpath is a extension to IS-IS, utilizing additional Type/Length/Value (TLV) tuples to distribute loading information. An algorithm to adjust forwarding, gradually enough to insure stability yet provide reasonably fast adjustment when needed, is provided in the related document OSPF-OMP [5]. The IS-IS encapsulation and minor differences in the dynamics of ISIS-OMP relative to OSPF-OMP are described here.

Reference-contexts: 1 Overview IS-IS is OSI link state routing protocol [2]. OSPF is a link state routing protocol defined within the IETF process [3]. IS-IS can also be used as an IP interior gateway protocol (IGP) much as OSPF is used <ref> [1] </ref>. Networks are often heavily loaded. Topologies often evolve to include multiple paths. Multiple paths may be initially designed to provide redundancy but also result from incremental addition of circuits to accommodate traffic growth. The redundant paths provide a potential to distribute traffic loading and reduce congestion.

The technique of equal cost multipath (ECMP) routing is formally defined in OSPF <ref> [3] </ref> but has also been applied to IS-IS implementations. Because these routing protocols are quite similar, application of OMP techniques is very similar. Differences between OSPF and IS-IS that impact OMP are: 1.

Reference-contexts: Villamizar, Li Expires April 12, 1999 [Page 4] INTERNET-DRAFT IS-IS Optimized Multipath (ISIS-OMP) October 12, 1998 Generally ISIS is not used to carry exterior routing information. Instead, a separate exterior gateway protocol is used, specifically BGP-4 <ref> [4] </ref>. When BGP-4 is used to carry external routes within an AS (this is referred to as Internal BGP or IBGP), IS-IS is used strictly as an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP).
