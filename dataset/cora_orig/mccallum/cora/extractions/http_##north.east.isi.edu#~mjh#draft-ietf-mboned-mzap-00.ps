Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as work in progress. Abstract This document defines a protocol, the Multicast-Scope Zone Announcement Protocol (MZAP), for discovering the multicast administrative scope zones that are relevant at a particular location. MZAP also provides mechanisms whereby two common misconfigurations of administrative scope zones can be discovered.

Reference-contexts: 1 Status This is a strawman proposal. It has not been subject to any peer review or implementation. 2 Introduction IP Multicast groups can be global scope, or they can be restricted in scope using a scoping mechanism. In this document, we only consider administrative scoping, as defined in <ref> [1] </ref>. An administrative scope zone is defined by a set of border routers to a region of the network. These border routers are configured to not pass multicast traffic destined for a particular range of multicast addresses to or from links leaving the scope zone. <p> The only zones a host can assume that it is within are the global zone, and local scope. Local scope is defined as being the smallest administrative scope zone encompassing a host, and the border is configured for addresses in the range 239.255.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 inclusive. <ref> [1] </ref> specifies: 239.255.0.0/16 is defined to be the IPv4 Local Scope. The Local Scope is the minimal enclosing scope, and hence is not further divisible. Although the exact extent of a Local Scope is site dependent, locally scoped regions must obey certain topological constraints. <p> Any interface that is configured to be a border for any admin scope zone MUST also be a border for the local scope zone, as defined in <ref> [1] </ref>. Routers SHOULD be configured so as the router itself is within the scope zone. This is should in figure 1A, where router 1 is inside the scope zone and has the border configuration.

Reference-contexts: However, listening to Zone Announcement Messages is not the recommended method for regular applications to discover this information. These applications will normally query a local Multicast Address Allocation Server <ref> [2] </ref>, which in turn will listen to Zone Announcement Messages.
