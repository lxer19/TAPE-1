Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. We consider the numerical solution of a linear parabolic initial boundary value problem, spatially discretised by a conforming Galerkin finite element method. This leads to a linear system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), see e.g. <ref> [5, 14] </ref>, with B the symmetric positive definite mass matrix, A the stiffness matrix, and u (t) = (u 1 (t); u 2 (t); : : : ; u d (t)) t the unknown solution vector. In [5] we considered solving (1.1) with the continuous-time multigrid waveform relaxation method. <p> In <ref> [5] </ref> we considered solving (1.1) with the continuous-time multigrid waveform relaxation method. This method is based on waveform relaxation, a highly parallel technique for solving very large systems of ODEs, [7, 10]. <p> In this paper, we continue our study of the multigrid waveform relaxation method for systems of the form (1.1). In particular, we analyse the effect of time-discretisation when linear multistep formulae are used. The structure of this paper is similar to the structure of <ref> [5] </ref>. In x2, we analyse the spectral properties of certain operators that arise in the formulation of the waveform relaxation methods. <p> We assume the splitting is such that M B is invertible. This iterative scheme can be written in explicit form as u (-) = Ku (-1) + '. The convergence properties of iteration operator K, the continuous-time waveform relaxation operator, have been studied in <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> The resulting iteration can be accelerated by using the multigrid principle, in a very similar way as the standard point-wise relaxation methods are accelerated when solving elliptic partial differential equations. The continuous-time two-grid waveform relaxation scheme is sketched below. We refer to <ref> [5] </ref> for a more elaborate description. The algorithm uses two nested grids, a coarse grid H and a fine grid h . <p> This two-grid cycle can be written as u (-) = Mu (-1) + ', where M is called the continuous-time two-grid waveform relaxation operator. The convergence formulae of M as an iteration operator resemble those of the standard waveform relaxation method. More precisely, in <ref> [5] </ref> we find respectively for the finite and for the infinite time-interval case (M) = (M (1)) and (M) = sup (M (z)) = sup (M (i~)) :(5.2) M (z), the continuous-time two-grid waveform relaxation matrix, is given by M (z) = K -2 (z)(I p (zB H + A H <p> Time-level convergence factors (-) k as a function of k (BDF (5) method) 6.2. Numerical results. In the current section we shall present numerical re sults for a model problem that was also considered in <ref> [5] </ref>, i.e., the two-dimensional heat equation, @u 2 u = 0 ; (x; y) 2 [0; 1] fi [0; 1] ; t 2 [0; 1] ;(6.3) with Dirichlet boundary conditions and an initial condition such that the analytical solution equals u (x; y; t) = 1 + sin (x=2) sin (y=2) <p> For a constant value of h, we expect the averaged convergence factors to converge to the continuous-time results when t decreases, see x4.3 and x5.3. (In <ref> [5] </ref>, the continuous-time convergence factors are approximated by the results obtained with the CN method with t = 1=1000). This behaviour is recognised clearly for the CN method, in Tables 6.5 and 6.8.

We shall assume that k starting values y 0 ; y 1 ; : : : ; y k1 are given. <p> For future reference, we also define the stability region of a linear multistep method, and the related notion of A (ff)-stability, see e.g. <ref> [3, 6] </ref>.
