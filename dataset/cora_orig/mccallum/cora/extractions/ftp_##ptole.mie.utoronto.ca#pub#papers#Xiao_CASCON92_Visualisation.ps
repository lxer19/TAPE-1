Title: Visualisation of Large Networks in 3-D Space: Issues in Implementation and Experimental Evaluation  
Author: Yan Xiao Paul Milgram 
Abstract: Three dimensional visualisation has become a widespread scheme for helping users to access and manage large information network. In this report, various techniques for displaying depth information are reviewed, with an emphasis on stereoscopic displays. Input devices used to interact with a 3-D space are also examined. Issues in 3-D network visualisation are elicited from three viewpoints: psychological, task-related and implementational. Consideration of these issues leads to the design of a preliminary experimental programme for evaluating various network visu-alisation techniques.

Reference-contexts: The general approach is to provide each eye with a slightly (horizontally) shifted image of an object. There are, according to one taxonomy, two methods of providing stereopsis: time parallel and time multiplexed methods <ref> [6] </ref>, that is, whether or not images are viewed by two eyes simultaneously or alternately. 4.1 Time Parallel Method The anaglyph method is probably the simplest method of showing two images at the same time.

Reference-contexts: Occlusion. In the real world, objects in the front always occlude those in the back. Although occlusion is considered to be a powerful cue in other environments <ref> [9] </ref>, in displaying network structure, there are usually no volume objects, and thus occlusion is unlikely to be a strong cue for depth perception. In addition, occlusion gives information only about the relative depth of objects, not on their absolute depth.

However, there is usually a cost associated with the display of each cue. Choosing a right combination requires both basic psychological studies, and empirical testing in a particular application domain. Dynamic cues are usually very strong but require rapid updating.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In numerous application areas, large data structures pose difficulties to users. Problems occur in access and manipulation due to the complexity and the size of these data sets. For example, in software engineering, designing, managing, and maintaining software systems become more and more challenging 1 <ref> [12] </ref>. Along with this challenge comes the growing need to develop effective supporting tools or environments for users such as software designers.

Reference-contexts: This is a very strong cue when a dynamic display is available <ref> [14] </ref>. The drawback of using this cue is that once the display is static, the effect 7 disappears.

Reference-contexts: Random dot stereogramme is another simple way to achieve stereopsis, though no serious application has been known, Using two optical paths to feed images from two computer screens is a powerful (and expensive) method of generating binocular disparity cue. This method is often implemented by a helmet-mounted display <ref> [15] </ref>. 4.2 Time Multiplexed Method Using one display monitor, but switching between each of the two eyes alternately, is by far the easiest way to achieve stereopsis. This method requires displaying two images (left and right) alternately to each eye.

Reference-contexts: Users view through a liquid crystal shutter system that synchronises with the display. To eliminating flickering due to the alternation, a frequency of usually higher than 40 Hz for each eye (total of 80 Hz) should be used <ref> [16] </ref>. Two techniques can be used to implement this. By putting a shutter system that polarises light in front of the display monitor, simple polarised lenses will ensure that each image is viewed only by the appropriate eye.
