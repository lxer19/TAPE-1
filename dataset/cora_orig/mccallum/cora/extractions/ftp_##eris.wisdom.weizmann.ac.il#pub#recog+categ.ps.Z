Abstract: One of the difficulties of object recognition stems from the need to overcome the variability in object appearance caused by factors such as illumination and pose. The influence of these factors can be countered by learning to interpolate between stored views of the target object, taken under representative combinations of viewing conditions. Difficulties of another kind arise in daily life situations that require categorization, rather than recognition, of objects. We show that, although categorization cannot rely on interpolation between stored examples, knowledge of several representative members, or prototypes, of each of the categories of interest can still provide the necessary computational substrate for the categorization of new instances. The resulting representational scheme based on similarities to prototypes is computationally viable, and is readily mapped onto the mechanisms of biological vision revealed by recent psychophysical and physiological studies.

Reference-contexts: Because only a few target views are usually available for training, the problem is to interpolate the view space of the target object, given some examples of its members. With basis function interpolation <ref> (Broomhead and Lowe, 1988) </ref>, this problem can be solved by a distributed network, whose structure can be learned from examples (Poggio and Girosi, 1990).

Reference-contexts: An application of RBF interpolation to object recognition has been described in (Poggio and Edelman, 1990); the RBF model was subsequently used to replicate a number of central characteristics of the process of recognition in human vision <ref> (Bulthoff and Edelman, 1992) </ref>. In its simple version, one basis function is used for (the measurement-space representation of) each familiar view. The appropriate weight for each basis is then computed by an algorithm that involves matrix inversion (a closed-form solution exists for this case).

Reference-contexts: In the recognition scenario, the tacit assumption is that the stimulus image is either totally unfamiliar, or, in fact, corresponds to one of the objects known to the system. A sensible generic decision strategy under this assumption is nearest-neighbor <ref> (Cover and Hart, 1967) </ref>, which assigns to the stimulus the label of the object that matches it optimally (modulo the influence of the extrinsic factors, and, possibly, measurement noise).

This approach takes advantage of the distributed representation of the stimulus by postponing the Winner Take All decision until after the second-level module has taken into account the similarities of the stimulus to all reference objects.

Reference-contexts: A common parameterization is especially straightforward for shapes that are sampled at a preset resolution, then defined by the coordinates of the sample points (cf. Figure 1). For instance, a family of shapes each of which is a "cloud" of k points spans a 3k-dimensional shape space <ref> (Kendall, 1984) </ref>; moving the k points around in 3D (or, equivalently, moving around the single point in the 3k-dimensional shape space) amounts to changing one shape into another.

Reference-contexts: To that end, we used the 43 test objects shown in Figure 6. To visualize the utility of representation by similarity to the training objects, we used multidimensional scaling <ref> (Shepard, 1980) </ref> to embed the 10-dimensional layout of points corresponding to various views of the test objects into a two-dimensional space (Figure 7). An examination of the resulting plot revealed two satisfying properties.

Reference-contexts: The results of several recent psychophysical studies of object representation in primates support the above conjecture. In each of a series of experiments, which involved subjective judgment of shape similarity and delayed matching to sample, human subjects (Edelman, 1995a; Cutzu and Edelman, 1996) and monkeys <ref> (Sugihara et al., 1998) </ref> have been confronted with several classes of computer-rendered 3D animal-like shapes, arranged in a complex pattern in a common parameter space (cf. Shepard & Cermak, 1973).

Reference-contexts: Note that under all methods, the errors improved when the second and the third sets of category labels were used. 5.1 Implications for theories of visual representation In computer vision, one may discern three main theoretical approaches to object representation: pictorial representations, structural descriptions, and feature spaces <ref> (Ullman, 1989) </ref>. <p> Because of the effects of factors extrinsic to shape, this mode of representation can be used for recognition only if it is accompanied by a method for normalizing the appearance of objects <ref> (Ullman, 1989) </ref> or, more generally, for separating the effects of pose from the effects of shape (Ullman and Basri, 1991; Tomasi and Kanade, 1992). It is not easy to adapt the pictorial approach to carry out categorization rather than recognition.

Reference-contexts: an object is determined not only by its shape and surface properties, but also by its disposition with respect to the observer and the illumination sources, by the optical properties of the intervening medium and the imaging system, and by the presence and location of other objects in the scene <ref> (Ullman, 1996) </ref>. Thus, to detect that two images belong, in fact, to the same three-dimensional object, the visual system must overcome the influence of a number of factors that affect the way objects look. <p> Although a metric over images that would downplay within-category differences may be defined in some domains, such as classification of stylized "clip art" drawings <ref> (Ullman, 1996, p.173) </ref>, attempts to classify pictorially represented 3D objects (vehicles) met with only a limited success (Shapira and Ullman, 1991). We believe that extension of alignment-like approaches from recognition to categorization is problematic for a deeper reason than mere excess of information in images of objects.

Reference-contexts: If further experimentation reveals that a given object consistently activates a certain possibly disconnected subset of the columns, and if that pattern of activation smoothly changes in response to a continuous change in the shape or the orientation <ref> (Wang et al., 1996) </ref> of the stimulus, the principle of representation of similarity that serves as the basis of Chorus would be implicated also as the principle behind shape representation in the cortex. The results of several recent psychophysical studies of object representation in primates support the above conjecture.
