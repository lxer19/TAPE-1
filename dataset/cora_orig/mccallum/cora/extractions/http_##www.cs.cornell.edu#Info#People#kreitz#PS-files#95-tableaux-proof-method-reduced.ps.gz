Abstract: fjeotten,kreitzg@intellektik.informatik.th-darmstadt.de Abstract. We present a proof method for intuitionistic logic based on Wallen's matrix characterization. Our approach combines the connection calculus and the sequent calculus. The search technique is based on notions of paths and connections and thus avoids redundancies in the search space. During the proof search the computed first-order and intuitionistic substitutions are used to simultaneously construct a sequent proof which is more human oriented than the matrix proof. This allows to use our method within interactive proof environments. Furthermore we can consider local substitutions instead of global ones and treat substitutions occurring in different branches of the sequent proof independently. This reduces the number of extra copies of formulae to be considered.

Reference-contexts: The advantage of such a method is that the emphasis on connections drastically reduces the search space compared to calculi analyzing the outer structure of formulae such as the sequent calculus [9, 7] or tableaux calculi <ref> [1, 16] </ref>. Furthermore it avoids the notational redundancy contained in these calculi by a very compact representation. The connection method is efficient for finding proofs according to the matrix characterization of validity. Its result, however, is almost impossible to read.

Reference-contexts: In his investigations on non-classical logics Wallen has used this embedding to develop a matrix characterization for the validity of intuitionistic formulae [18] which extends Bibel's characterization for classical validity <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. In propositional classical logic a formula F is valid if there is a spanning set of connections for F . A connection is a pair of atomic formulae with different polarities. <p> The number of copies generated to complete the proof is called multiplicity . Again, a multiplicity may be due to a quantifier or specific to intuitionistic reasoning. Developing an automated procedure which constructs intuitionistic proofs on the basis of Wallen's matrix characterization means extending Bibel's connection method <ref> [4] </ref> accordingly. The advantage of such a method is that the emphasis on connections drastically reduces the search space compared to calculi analyzing the outer structure of formulae such as the sequent calculus [9, 7] or tableaux calculi [1, 16]. <p> Sequent proof for 8xP x ) P a ^ P b 2.3 A Matrix Characterization for Intuitionistic Logic The matrix characterization for intuitionistic logic developed by Wallen [17, 18] is based on the notion of paths and connections pioneered by Bibel for classical logic <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. We first resume the characterization for classical first-order logic. 125 Theorem 1. <p> A first-order substitution Q is admissible if the reduction ordering is irreflexive. In this case a proof in the sequent calculus is constructible. This technique was first proposed by Bibel <ref> [4] </ref> as an alternative for skolemization in classical logic. The intuitionistic sequent calculus contains special rules which, if used analytically, cause formulae to be deleted from a sequent. <p> complementary under the substitutions Q = fa 1 1 na; a 2 1 n*; a 2 2 na 4 ; a 2 Therefore the formula is intuitionistically valid. 2.4 The Connection Method A proof method for classical first-order logic based on theorem 1 is the connection method developed by Bibel <ref> [4] </ref>. The proof search is driven by connections instead of connectives as in the sequent calculus. Once a connection has been identified all paths containing this connection are eliminated. If every paths is deleted the formula is valid. <p> This technique is similar to Bibel's splitting technique <ref> [4] </ref>. Our approach, however, is simpler and can be applied more rigorously since we are able to exploit the sequent proof. When computing the substitution which has to make a connection complementary we only have to consider substitutions related to branches of the active fi-path. <p> Our method extends Bibel's connection method <ref> [4] </ref> according Wallen's matrix characterization of intui-tionistic validity [18] but it does not require a normal form. Due to an emphasis on connections instead of the outer structure of formulae the search space can be kept comparably small.

Reference-contexts: This characterization also applies to predicate logic if all the terms contained in connected formulae can be made identical by some global (first-order ) (quantifier-) substitution . In sequent calculi (like Gentzen's LK and LJ [9] or Fitting's calculi <ref> [7] </ref>) the difference between classical and intuitionistic reasoning is expressed by certain restrictions on the intuitionistic rules.

The sequent calculus for intuitionistic logic differs from the classical one only in the rules ) right,:right and 8right. Whereas in the intuitionistic case the succedent of the conclusion consists of at most one formula, the corresponding classical rules may contain multiple formulae. We call these rules special rules.

For a full description see <ref> [14] </ref>. 134 5 Local Substitutions The sequent proof makes it possible to use so-called local substitutions instead of global ones. We present an approach to treat first-order as well as intuitionistic substitutions locally. The connection method and our proof method presented above use global substitutions. <p> ( A), is locally complementary under fi and fl if the connection (A; A) is complementary under the admissible combined substitution := L ( fl (u) j u 2 P fi for a or u 2 P fi for a) where L is the combination of substitutions (for details see <ref> [14] </ref>). Theorem 9. <p> Furthermore, it allows considering local substitutions instead of global ones which reduces the search space even more than a purely matrix-oriented proof method would do. The efficiency of our proof procedure also depends on the unification algorithm computing the so-called intuitionistic substitutions. In <ref> [14] </ref> we have developed a specialized string unification algorithm which is more efficient than the one presented in [13] since it computes only the most general substitutions which make the prefixes equal.
