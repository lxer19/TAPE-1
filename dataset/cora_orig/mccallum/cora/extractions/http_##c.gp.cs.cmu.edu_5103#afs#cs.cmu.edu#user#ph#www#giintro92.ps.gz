Title: Introduction to Global Illumination  Global Illumination Course SIGGRAPH '92  
Author: Paul S. Heckbert 
Note: 1-1  
Abstract: The goal of image synthesis research in computer graphics is the development of methods for modeling and rendering three-dimensional scenes. One of the most challenging tasks of image synthesis is the accurate and efficient simulation of global illumination effects: the illumination of objects in a scene by other objects. Early rendering programs shaded surfaces only, not volumes. Furthermore, they treated the visibility (visible surface) and shading tasks independently, employing a local illumination model that assumed that the shading of each surface is independent of the shading of other surfaces [Foley et al. 90, p. 760]. Local illumination models typically assume that light comes from a finite set of point light sources only. Global illumination models, on the other hand, recognize that visibility and shading are interrelated: the radiance (roughly, brightness) at one point is determined by the radiances of all other points in the scene. The physical phenomenon of global illumination is responsible for a number of visual effects: indirect illumination, color bleeding and the penumbras or soft shadows from area light sources. Before quantifying global illumination, we discuss some the physics qualitatively. Light is electromagnetic radiation at wavelengths visible to the human eye. Light interacts with matter in a number of ways. The phenomena most relevant to global illumination are emission, scattering, and absorption. All three of these effects occur in three-dimensional volumes, but because many objects in our world are opaque, it is convenient to speak of surfaces between volumes, and the emission, scattering, and absorption that occurs at surfaces. Emission can result from various physical processes including incandescence (emission due to heat), luminescence (emission due to chemical reaction, for example), or phosphorescence (time-delayed emission). In image synthesis applications, we typically don't care which mechanism is responsible, we merely need to know the strength of emission as a function of position and direction. Radiation is absorbed and scattered as it propagates through a medium. A medium is called a participating medium if the absorption and scattering are significant, and a nonparticipating medium if they are negligible. In global illumination, for example, we typically regard fog and smoke as participating media, and vacuum or air as non-participating. In scenes with participating media, the emission, scattering, and absorption at each point in space are relevant, so radiant power is a function of three-dimensional position within

Reference-contexts: With diffuse reflectance, the radiance of outgoing radiation is independent of the directional distribution of incident radiation: L o (x; fi) = L o (x). Put another way, diffuse reflectance obliterates the history of the incident radiation <ref> [Sparrow-Cess78] </ref>. In a nonparticipating medium, radiance is then a function of two-dimensional surface position only.
