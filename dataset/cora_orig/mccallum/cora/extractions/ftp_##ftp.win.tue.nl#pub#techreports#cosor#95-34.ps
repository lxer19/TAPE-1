Abstract: We consider two variants of the radio link frequency assignment problem. These problems arise in practice when a network of radio links has to be established. Each radio link has to be assigned a particular frequency. The interference level between the frequencies assigned to the different links has to be acceptable, since otherwise communication will be distorted. The frequency assignments have to comply with certain regulations and physical characteristics of the transmitters. Moreover, the number of frequencies is to be minimized, because each frequency used in the network has to be reserved at a certain cost. We develop several approximation algorithms for the problems, which are based on local search, and we compare their performance on some practical instances. Lower bounding techniques based on nonlinear programming and the chromatic number of a graph are used to estimate the quality of the approximate solutions for these instances. fl Partially supported by the EUCLID project RTP 6.4 as part of CEPA 6 ("Artificial Intelligence")

Reference-contexts: There are several neighborhood search strategies for finding good solutions. The basic iterative improvement method modifies at each step a given solution to a solution from its neighborhood of lower cost. This method stops when no better solution can be found in the neighborhood. Simulated annealing <ref> [1] </ref> modifies a solution to a random one chosen from its neighborhood. Improvements are always accepted. Deteriorations are accepted with a certain probability, decreasing during the run. Simulated annealing stops when this probability becomes smaller than a specified parameter.

Reference-contexts: Then there are only two non-interfering nodes i and j in the union of these sets that can be either connected or contracted <ref> [2] </ref>. Note that if i and j are connected, we immediately obtain a clique larger than K.

Reference-contexts: Splitting the problem in this way helps to exploit the underlying special structure. Clearly, both of these problems are NP-hard and thus no polynomial-time optimization algorithm is likely to exist <ref> [3] </ref>. A solution to a given minimization problem obtained by an approximation algorithm provides an upper bound for the optimal solution to this problem. In order to estimate the difference between the upper bounds and the optimum we also obtain some lower bounds for the test instances.

Reference-contexts: In order to guarantee quality of approximate solutions obtained by a local search a lower bounding technique has to be developed separately.

Reference-contexts: The methods for the first order problem can also be used when feasibility is lost during the search for the second order problem. 7 4.1 Constructing a starting solution There are two main strategies known from the literature (see for example <ref> [7] </ref>) to construct a feasible partial solution to the RLFAP. The frequency exhaustive strategy orders links and assigns frequencies to them in this order. The ordering of links should reflect the potential difficulty of assigning a frequency to them. Thus the difficult links are treated first.

Reference-contexts: To prevent this method from cycling, several recently visited solutions are removed from 3 any neighborhood. A stopping criterion has to be defined, for example the maximum number of iterations without improvement. Variable-depth search <ref> [8] </ref> performs a sequence of changes at each iteration. This sequence of changes is terminated if an improvement is found or if no gain is expected from further changes.
