Title: Building a Dedicated Robotic Soccer System

Abstract: Robotic Soccer involves multiple agents that need to collaborate in an adversarial environment to achieve specific objectives. We have been building an architecture that addresses this integration of high-level and low-level reasoning as a combined system of mini-robots, a camera for perception, a centralized interface computer, and several client servers as the minds of the mini-robot players. In this paper we focus on the hardware design of our mini-robots. Our main purpose is to provide a detailed description of our design decisions so that others may learn from and replicate our efforts. Communication between the interface computer and the mini-robots is achieved through coded infrared radiation. The mini-robots can turn on the spot and move forward and backward with variable speed. Our design also allows a well-balanced use of the on-board power and current supplies.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we discuss the design decisions we faced along with the impasses we encountered during our quest to build small robots, which call mini-robots, capable of playing Robotic Soccer. We are not the first to build robots for this domain <ref> [ Asada et al., 1994a; Sahota et al., 1995 ] </ref> , however our system is distinctly different from the others about which we know. <p> We also hope to do minimal hard-wiring, instead learning behaviors from the bottom up. The Robotic Soccer system being developed in Asada's lab is very different from both the Dynamo system and from our own <ref> [ Asada et al., 1994a; 1994b ] </ref> . Asada's robots are larger and are equipped with on-board sensing capabilities. They have been used to develop some low-level behaviors such as shooting and avoiding as well as a RL technique for combining behaviors [ Asada et al., 1994a; 1994b ] . <p> both the Dynamo system and from our own <ref> [ Asada et al., 1994a; 1994b ] </ref> .

While the goals of this research are very similar to our own, the approach is different.

Reference-contexts: For the perception-based control, we will build upon and extend multiple robot path planning which assumes global control <ref> [ Ferrari et al., 1995 ] </ref> . Our added challenge is that each mini-robot is controlled by a separate client. We may eventually include limited on-board sensing and intra-robot communication as in [ Suzuki et al., 1995 ] to aid in path planning and obstacle avoidance.

Reference-contexts: Sahota used this system to introduce a decision making strategy called reactive deliberation which was used to choose from among seven hard-wired behaviors [ Sahota, 1994 ] . Subsequently, Ford used Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to choose from among the same hardwired behaviors <ref> [ Ford et al., 1994 ] </ref> . Our system differs from the Dynamo system in several ways, most notably our use of infrared (IR) rather than radio waves for communication between the controlling computer and the cars.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As robots become more adept at operating in the real world, the high-level issues of collaborative and adversarial planning and learning in real-time situations are becoming more important. An interesting emerging domain that is particularly appropriate for studying these issues is Robotic Soccer. Although realistic simulation environments exist <ref> [ Noda, 1995; Sahota, 1993 ] </ref> and are useful, it is important to have some actual physical agents in order to address the full complexity of the task. <p> Planning is also in progress for the 1997 robot soccer competition at IJCAI, to be called RoboCup97 [ Kitano et al., 1997 ] . Along with the real robot competition, RoboCup97 will also include a simulator-based tournament using the Soccer Server system designed by Noda <ref> [ Noda, 1995 ] </ref> . While we continue working on our real-world system, we have been concurrently developing learning techniques in simulation [ Stone and Veloso, 1995; 1996 ] . We eventually hope to transfer these learning techniques to the real system as we develop a complete Robotic Soccer architecture.

A ground-breaking system for Robotic Soccer, and the one that served as the inspiration and basis for our work, is the Dynamo System developed at the University of British Columbia <ref> [ Sahota et al., 1995 ] </ref> . This system was designed to be capable of supporting several robots per team, but most work has been done in a 1 vs. 1 scenario. <p> Figure 1 sketches the building blocks of the architecture. In the rest of the paper we will describe in detail the specification of the mini-robots. As opposed to using radio communication as in a variety of other systems including <ref> [ Sahota et al., 1995 ] </ref> , we use infrared communication for its multiple advantages, as identified in [ Suzuki et al., 1995 ] . Each mini-robot has on-board an infrared detector which allows it to receive and decode commands sent by a transmitter at the main host computer.
