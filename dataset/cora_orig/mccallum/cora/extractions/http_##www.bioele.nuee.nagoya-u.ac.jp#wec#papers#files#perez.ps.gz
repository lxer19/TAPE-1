Abstract: Inductive learning algorithms try to obtain the knowledge of a system from a set of examples. One of the most difficult problems in machine learning consists in getting the structure of this knowledge. We propose an algorithm able to manage with fuzzy information and able to learn the structure of the rules that represent the system. The algorithm gives a reasonable small set of fuzzy rules that represent the original set of examples.

Reference-contexts: This model of rule has been used in the literature for different authors (see <ref> [1, 6, 7] </ref> for example). Moreover, this model of rule is important since allows us to change the granularity of the domain by combining different elements. For example the rule shown in (1) assigns the value fVery-Low , Low, Mediumg to the variable X 2 . <p> Therefore we propose the following weak definition of consistency. Definition 2.1 Let R 2 be a rule and k 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> be fixed parameter, we say that the rule R satisfies the k-consistency condition if and only if * if k = 0 then n E (R) = 0 * if k 2 (0; 1] then n E (R) kn + The classical consistency condition is included in this definition <p> k 2 then R satisfies de k 1 -consistency condition ) R satisfies de k 2 -consistency condition By using the above proposition, and if we de note by k the set of rules that satisfy the k-consistency condition, then k 1 k 2 8k 1 ; k 2 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> such that k 1 k 2 : Therefore if we increase the value of the parameter k we also increase the size of the search space for the best rules (see figure 2). <p> We know the consequent variable, and we want to know which are the antecedent variables able to identify each value of the consequent variable. We will choose among those rules that satisfy the k-consistency condition, with k 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> a fixed parameter. The search space is k , and we need a criterion to decide what are the best rules. This criterion will be applied in an ordered way.

Reference-contexts: The three first databases correspond to artificial domains and the fourth one is the Iris Plants Database, IRIS, created by R.A. Fisher <ref> [4] </ref>. One of the artificial database, ART1, has been created by simulation of a fixed fuzzy rule set. The other artificial databases, ART2 and ART3, have been created in the same way but adding a 10 % and 25 % porcentage of noise on the examples, repec-tively.

Reference-contexts: We solve this problem by means of a procedure called GEN ET IC that uses a simple genetic algorithm working on the binary codification of the rule R B (A) proposed in <ref> [5] </ref> and the fitness function fitness (R B (A)) = = n + (R B (A)) if R B (A) 2 k 0 otherwise An important concept used in this learning algorithm is the set of examples covered by a rule. <p> Therefore we propose the following definition. Definition 3.1 Let R be a rule and E a set of examples. The subset of E representing the examples -covered by R is the -cut of E + (R). will be called the covering parameter. The basic optimization algorithm was described in <ref> [5] </ref>. The input of the procedure GENETIC is a set of examples E and a value of the consequent variable B 2 F , and the output is a rule R B (A) 2 k representing the rule with consequent B and the biggest number of positive examples on E.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Knowledge acquisition is one of the main problems in developing knowledge based systems. An appealing alternative to the classical elicitation of knowledge consists in using automatic learning techniques <ref> [7, 8] </ref>.

This value can be interpreted as a new label "less or equal to medium". The proposed model of rule allows us therefore to include some structured descriptors <ref> [7] </ref> in an easy way. Learning the structure of rule is not an easy problem. <p> The next section is devoted to introduce a soft consistency condition basic to describe the learning algorithm shown in section 3. Finally, in the last section we make different experimental studies in order to show the behaviour of the proposed method. 2 The k-consistency condi tion In <ref> [7] </ref> Michalski introduces two conditions that must be satisfied for a learning algorithm to get acceptable concept recognition rules. These conditions are the completeness and the consistency conditions. The completeness condition states that every example of some class must satisfy some of the rule of this class.
