Abstract: We introduce the problem of mining association rules in large relational tables containing both quantitative and categorical attributes. An example of such an association might be "10% of married people between age 50 and 60 have at least 2 cars". We deal with quantitative attributes by fine-partitioning the values of the attribute and then combining adjacent partitions as necessary. We introduce measures of partial completeness which quantify the information lost due to partitioning. A direct application of this technique can generate too many similar rules. We tackle this problem by using a "greater-than-expected-value" interest measure to identify the interesting rules in the output. We give an algorithm for mining such quantitative association rules. Finally, we describe the results of using this approach on a real-life dataset.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in databases, has been recognized as a new area for database research. The problem of discovering association rules was introduced in <ref> [AIS93] </ref>. Given a set of transactions, where each transaction is a set of items, an association rule is an expression of the from X ) Y , where X and Y are sets of items. <p> However, to yield a fast implementation, the computational details of how candidates are generated and how their supports are counted are new. We present our experience with this solution on a real-life dataset in Section 6. 1.3 Related Work Since the introduction of the (Boolean) Association Rules problem in <ref> [AIS93] </ref>, there has been considerable work on designing algorithms for mining such rules [AS94] [HS95] [MTV94] [SON95] [PCY95]. This work was subsequently extended to finding association rules when there is a taxonomy on the items in [SA95] [HF95].

Reference-contexts: If the domain of values for a quantitative approach is large, an obvious approach will be to first partition the values into intervals and then map each hattribute, intervali pair to a boolean attribute. We can now use any algorithm for finding Boolean Association Rules (e.g. <ref> [AS94] </ref>) to find 1 People RecordID Age Married NumCars 100 23 No 1 300 29 No 0 500 38 Yes 2 (minimum support = 40%, minimum confidence = 50%) Rules (Sample) Support Confidence hAge: 30..39i and hMarried: Yesi ) hNumCars: 2i 40% 100% hNumCars: 0..1i ) hMarried: Noi 40% 66.6% quantitative <p> This measure is an extension of the interest-measure introduced in [SA95]. We give the algorithm for discovering quantitative association rules in Section 5. This algorithm shares the basic structure of the algorithm for finding boolean association rules given in <ref> [AS94] </ref>. However, to yield a fast implementation, the computational details of how candidates are generated and how their supports are counted are new. <p> We present our experience with this solution on a real-life dataset in Section 6. 1.3 Related Work Since the introduction of the (Boolean) Association Rules problem in [AIS93], there has been considerable work on designing algorithms for mining such rules <ref> [AS94] </ref> [HS95] [MTV94] [SON95] [PCY95]. This work was subsequently extended to finding association rules when there is a taxonomy on the items in [SA95] [HF95]. Related work also includes [PS91], where quantitative rules of the from x = q x ) y = q y are discovered. <p> If conf minconf, then the rule holds. (The rule will have minimum support because ABCD is frequent.) We use the algorithm in <ref> [AS94] </ref> to generate rules. 5. Determine the interesting rules in the output. (See Section 4.) Example Consider the "People" table shown in Figure 3a. There are two quantitative attributes, Age and NumCars. Assume that in Step 1, we decided to partition Age into 4 intervals, as shown in Figure 3b. <p> These combinations, along with those values of categorical attributes that have minimum support, form the frequent items. Starting with the frequent items, we generate all frequent itemsets using an algorithm based on the Apriori algorithm for finding boolean association rules given in <ref> [AS94] </ref>. The proposed algorithm extends the candidate generation procedure to add pruning using the interest measure, and uses a different data structure for counting candidates. Let k-itemset denote an itemset having k items. <p> The quantitative part contains the following information. Age NumCars 20..24 0..1 24..29 2..2 We can now split the problem into two parts: 1. We first find which "super-candidates" are supported by the categorical attributes in the record. We re-use a hash-tree data structure described in <ref> [AS94] </ref> to reduce the number of super-candidates that need to be checked for a given record. 2.

Reference-contexts: Thus the problem reduces to finding which n-dimensional rectangles contain a given n-dimensional point, for a set of n-dimensional points. The classic solution to this problem is to put the rectangles in a R*-tree <ref> [BKSS90] </ref>. If the number of dimensions is small, and the range of values in each dimension is also small, there is a faster solution.

Reference-contexts: It is not meaningful to combine categorical attribute values unless unless a taxonomy (is-a hierarchy) is present on the attribute.

Reference-contexts: It tends to split adjacent values with high support into separate intervals though their behavior would typically be similar. It may be worth exploring the use of clustering algorithms <ref> [JD88] </ref> for partitioning, and their relationship to partial completeness.
