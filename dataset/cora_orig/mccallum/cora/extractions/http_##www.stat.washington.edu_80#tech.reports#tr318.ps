Reference-contexts: Suppose the regression data are Y i j X i ~ N (fi 0 + fi 1 X i ; 2 ). A standard bootstrap would proceed by resampling the residuals <ref> (e.g. Efron and Gong, 1983, p. 43) </ref>. Fit the model, and find the residuals e i = Y i ^ Y i = Y i ^ fi 0 ^ fi 1 X i . Resample the residuals with replacement, obtaining pseudo-residuals e fl i .

Reference-contexts: Rather, it assumes that they are known exactly. At the 1996 SC meeting, a modified maximum likelihood method that can take account of uncertainty in biological parameters was proposed <ref> (Punt and Butterworth, 1996b) </ref>. This method is an extension of an approach developed by Restrepo et al. (1991; 1992).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Over the past 6 years, various assessment methods for the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort stock of bowhead whales have been discussed by the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). A Bayesian approach <ref> (Raftery et al. 1995) </ref> was adopted and used as the basis for the IWC assessment of the stock in 1994. The method was developed after a 1991 Scientific Committee recommendation that methods for taking full account of uncertainty about inputs and outputs to population dynamics models be developed.

Reference-contexts: The "prior" for the nuisance parameter MSYR is Gamma (8.2, 372.7), and the likelihood for the observed total population in 1993 is N (P 1993 ; 626 2 ). These choices are based on IWC consensus (IWC, 1995) and are the same as used in previous work <ref> (Raftery, et al. 1996) </ref>. We assume that we have a single observation from the likelihood for P 1993 . In practice this is usually obtained via a census. The observation is typically a maximum likelihood estimate of P 1993 , so we denote it by ^ P 1993 .
