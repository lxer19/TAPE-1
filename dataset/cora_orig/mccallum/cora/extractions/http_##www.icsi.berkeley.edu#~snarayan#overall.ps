Abstract: Summary: This abstract describes a novel computational model that is capable of reasoning about descriptions of abstract events and actions appearing in newspaper stories. The computational model exploits the fact that the structure of abstract actions (such as states, causes, purposes, means, etc.) are characterized cognitively by metaphoric mappings to embodied concepts from the domains of force, motion, and space. By explicitly representing and reasoning with metaphors, the system is able to interpret simple newspaper stories in the domains of Politics and Economics. When presented with a pre-parsed version of these narratives, the system described is able to generate commonsense inferences consistent with the input. Acknowledgments: Jerry Feldman and George Lakoff have provided advice and encouragement and made substantial contributions to the work presented here. I have also benefited greatly from discussions with David Bailey, Dan Jurafsky, Lokendra Shastri, and Robert Wilensky. I would like to thank the members the Lzero group, Stuart Russell's RUGS graduate seminar group and the Cognitive Linguistics group at UC Berkeley for putting up with presentations of this work at various stages of development and offering data and advice on various aspects.

Reference-contexts: It is worth noting that such systems are increasingly turning to the causal network models for this purpose. In terms of cognitive commitment, this effort and the Lzero project <ref> (Feldman et al. 1994) </ref> at UC Berkeley takes seriously the hypothesis that much of the meaning of abstract concepts comes from projections from embodied notions; a view first advocated within modern cognitive science by (LJ 1980).

Reference-contexts: In our experiments, we found the stochastic simulation method with evidence weighting <ref> (Fung 1990) </ref> to converge quite adequately for the examples used so far. We have also used exact methods such as the JLO algorithm to validate and verify our results. domain of physical motion. The network encodes the following micro theory about the proposition loose balance.

Reference-contexts: Such observations have resulted in proposals that abstract reason is grounded in recurring patterns of experience called Image Schemas <ref> (Lakoff 1987) </ref>. However, the work in Cognitive Semantics lacks any computational model for such theories, and consequently such ideas cannot currently be used in natural language understanding or problem solving systems.
