Abstract: By exploiting centrifugal and Coriolis forces, simple, low-degree-of-freedom robots can control objects with more degrees-of-freedom. For example, by allowing the object to roll and slip, a one-degree-of-freedom revolute robot can take a planar object to a full-dimensional subset of its state space. We present a dynamic manipulation planner that finds manipulator trajectories to move an object from one state to another without grasping it. The trajectories have been successfully implemented on a one-degree-of-freedom direct-drive arm to perform dynamic tasks such as snatching an object from a table, rolling an object on the surface of the arm, and throwing and catching.

Dynamic underactuated manipulation is similar to the control of underactuated manipulators, except the unactuated freedoms are controlled through unilateral frictional contacts.

Reference-contexts: object is a frictionless disk centered at its center of mass (Lynch and Mason [18]). * A single revolute joint, operating above a fixed-speed conveyor, can move any polygon from any initial configuration on the conveyor to a single goal configuration by using pushing and conveyor drift (Akella et al. <ref> [3] </ref>). In this paper we study underactuated nonprehensile manipulation using a dynamic model. In Section 4 we show how a one-degree-of-freedom revolute robot, with just a two-dimensional state space, can take a planar object to a six-dimensional subset of its six-dimensional state space.

Reference-contexts: Finally, Section 6 presents experiments with a one-degree-of-freedom direct-drive arm. The arm automatically executes dynamic tasks such as snatching an object from a table, rolling an object on the surface of the arm, and throwing and catching. This paper summarizes work presented in (Lynch <ref> [17] </ref>). 2 Related Work This research has been inspired by industrial parts feeders using dynamic nonprehensile manipulation, such as bowl feeders and the APOS system (Hitakawa [14]).

See (Lynch <ref> [17] </ref>) for other related work. 3 Assumptions All problems considered in this paper are planar, and the non-prehensile contact between the object and the manipulator is always either a point or line contact. Objects are polygonal. <p> To show this, we can examine the Lie algebra of vector fields describing the possible motions of the object as a function of the current state and the manipulator control (see Lynch <ref> [17] </ref>). A one-degree-of-freedom revolute robot can exploit Coriolis and centrifugal forces to achieve control of the object's six state variables, even with frictionless contact. A one-degree-of-freedom frictionless prismatic robot cannot. <p> To increase friction and damping on these surfaces, they have been covered with a soft, 5 mm thick foam. Because dynamic manipulation requires precise trajectory following, we have carefully modeled the response of the NSK motor. As a result, we obtain good open-loop tracking. (See (Lynch <ref> [17] </ref>) for details.) Small feedback corrections are also used. Trajectories specified by the planner are directly implemented on the robot, without modification. In some cases, however, effects that are not modeled in the planner cause the plans to fail when implemented on the robot. <p> Catches are made robust by appropriately choosing the object's impact state with the immobile arm. We describe a snatch, throw, roll, and rolling throw in Figures 5-13. The test objects are lightweight and made of wood. More details can be found in (Lynch <ref> [17] </ref>). 7 Conclusion and Future Work Dynamic underactuated nonprehensile manipulation exploits dynamic effects to achieve interesting behaviors with simple robots. This paper has presented an approach to generating open-loop controls that have been successfully implemented on a real robot system to perform a variety of dynamic tasks.

Reference-contexts: Ph.D. student at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. * A two-degree-of-freedom robot (a point translating in the plane) can push an object arbitrarily closely along any path in the object's three-dimensional configuration space, unless the object is a frictionless disk centered at its center of mass (Lynch and Mason <ref> [18] </ref>). * A single revolute joint, operating above a fixed-speed conveyor, can move any polygon from any initial configuration on the conveyor to a single goal configuration by using pushing and conveyor drift (Akella et al. [3]). In this paper we study underactuated nonprehensile manipulation using a dynamic model.

Reference-contexts: In general, we must account for the possibility of drift in the variables that are not being directly controlled. flight. In the context of dynamic nonprehensile manipulation, we can define the following control phases (Figure 2): 1. Dynamic grasp (Mason and Lynch <ref> [19] </ref>). An object is in a dynamic grasp if it makes line contact with the manipulator and the manipulator accelerates such that the object remains fixed against it.
