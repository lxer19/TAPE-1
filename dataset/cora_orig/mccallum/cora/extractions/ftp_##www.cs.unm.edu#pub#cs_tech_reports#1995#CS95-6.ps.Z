Abstract: This report gives an overview of the tools developed for the changedetection method based on the immune system, introduced by Forrest et al. in [6] and [7]. Some general theoretical results are given. Consequences of the detector generating algorithms from [8] and [5] are examined and some preliminary results with these algorithms are analyzed. Finally, guidelines are given for choosing the various parameters of the matching rule when applying this method to a real data stream.
