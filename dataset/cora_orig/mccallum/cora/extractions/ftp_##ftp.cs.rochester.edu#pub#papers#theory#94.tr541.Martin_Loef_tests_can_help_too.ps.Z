Title: Martin-Lof Tests Can Help Too

Abstract: We argue that Martin-Lof tests provide useful techniques in proofs involving Kolmogorov complexity. Our examples cover more areas: (1) logical definability; we prove an analogue of the 0-1 Law for various logics in terms of structures with high Kolmogorov complexity, (2) probabilistic computation: we display a relation between the Kolmogorov complexity of the random strings on which a probabilistic algorithm errs and the probability error of the algorithm as well as a trade-off relation between the error probability, the length of the random bits, the number of provers and the length of the provers' answers in one-round multiprover interactive proof systems for NP, and (3) convergence rates of probability asymptotics; we find a general lower bound on the convergence rate of such probabilities in terms of Kolmogorov complexity and provide a concrete example for the probability that a random graph with n vertices is connected.

Reference-contexts: We introduce the necessary terminology. Following <ref> [BGLR93] </ref>, we denote by MIP 1 (r (n); p (n); a (n); q (n); *(n)) a one round multiprover interactive system in which the number of random bits is r (n), the number of provers is p (n), the size of each provers' answers is a (n), the size of the <p> We say that L is accepted by a MIP 1 (r (n); p (n); a (n); q (n); *(n)) if there is a verifier V running the above protocol that accepts L.

Reference-contexts: We next give a concrete application, by considering the well-known fact which states that the probability that a random graph with n vertices is connected goes to 1 as n goes to 1 (see <ref> [Bol85] </ref>). We show that the limit of the probability that G is not connected does not converge to 0 faster than 2 p Our notation is standard and most of it is explicitely introduced in the text. <p> It is known that: lim P rob (G is connected ; jbin (G)j = n (n 1) ) = 1: For more information on this result and its later extensions, we guide the interested reader to the book by Bollobas <ref> [Bol85] </ref>. Proposition 5.2 For P as above, there is a constant d such that * P (n) d 2 p Proof: By a well known fact in Kolmogorov complexity theory, there exists a graph G with jbin (G)j = n and K (bin (G) j n) n.
