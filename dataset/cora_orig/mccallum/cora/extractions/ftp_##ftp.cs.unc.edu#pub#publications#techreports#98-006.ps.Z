Abstract: This paper presents a method for identifying image loci that can be used as a basis for object segmentation and image registration. The focus is on 1D and 2D shape loci in 3D images. This method, called marching ridges, uses generalized height ridges, oriented medi-alness measures and a marching cubes like algorithm to extract optimal scale-orientation cores. This algorithm can can also be used for other image processing tasks such as finding intensity skeletons of objects and identifying object boundaries.

Reference-contexts: Although this paper describes an algorithm for finding cores of 2D images, we are more interested in finding cores of 3D images, so the algorithm we have chosen is similar in structure to Lorensen's marching cubes [11] and Bloomenthals' tracked partitioning <ref> [1] </ref> for finding 2D cores and Thirion's [16] marching lines for finding 1D cores. This paper presents algorithms and results for 2D cores. 1D cores in 3D images are discussed in the conclusion and will be the subject of future work. This paper is divided into three main sections.

Reference-contexts: We measure an image using oriented medialness kernels and then find ridge within the marching framework using the optimal scale-orientation definition of height ridges. 2.1 Height ridges Maximum convexity height ridges The maximum convexity height ridge is dealt with extensively in Eberly's fine book <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> The maximum convexity height ridge does not guarantee such separation. 2. The incommensurability of position, radius and orientation can provide for non-Euclidean geometries in the domain of M . In the case of position and scale alone, Eberly <ref> [3] </ref> has shown a hyperbolic geometry in the domain of M . However, even then, there is a parameter involved relating derivatives in space to derivatives of radius. The optimal parameter hight ridge avoids this notion and guarantees Euclidean derivatives. 3.

Reference-contexts: Of particular interest to this paper are height ridges of medialness (called cores) that can be used as the basis for a figural shape model, the deformable shape locus, described by Pizer [15]. In this paper, we will concentrate on height ridges as they are defined in <ref> [8] </ref>. In particular, we will use the definition of optimal parameter ridges, in which certain parameters of the space in which we are finding ridges are distinguished. These ideas can be used for identifying boundaries, in which the boundary normal provides a distinguished orientation. <p> We do this by assuming that the locus of points f (x; s)j (x; s) 2 X fi Sg for which M (x; s) is maximal in S creates a well-defined manifold M. Except for non-generic situations, this assumption holds. (See <ref> [8] </ref> for failure of genericity). We then define a coordinate chart i : X ! M. This coordinate chart is well defined except at folds of M with respect to its projection onto X . <p> Subdimensional maxima Given the definition of a generalized height ridge, there is no guarantee that a point satisfying the derivative conditions in some subset of transverse directions will be a local maximum of the function restricted to the space spanned by those transverse directions. This concern was detailed in <ref> [8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Here we will concentrate our search for ridges in a scale-orientation space of medialness, in which we will distinguish scale and orientation. Cores are defined as height ridges of medialness. The particular medialness measures that we will use in this paper are oriented as described by Pizer <ref> [13] </ref>. The results shown in this paper are produced from a centered medialness kernel; we have begun work with bilocal kernels. <p> The marching cores algorithm continues this loop until there are no more cubes to process. This occurs as the ridges ends, closes or exits the image. 2.3 Oriented medialness Pizer <ref> [13, 15] </ref> describes a variety of options for producing medialness in 3D images. The medialness used to produce the examples in this paper is the semi-linear, central medialness described in [13]. <p> This occurs as the ridges ends, closes or exits the image. 2.3 Oriented medialness Pizer [13, 15] describes a variety of options for producing medialness in 3D images. The medialness used to produce the examples in this paper is the semi-linear, central medialness described in <ref> [13] </ref>. It is designed to reduce the effects of interfigural interference on the calculation of cores, as well as to give a more accurate width estimation of objects.

Reference-contexts: Ridges of boundariness can also be used to identify edges using the Canny definition.

In this work, we choose to calculate optimal parameter ridges for three major reasons: 1. Distinguishing certain parameters seems a natural and intuitive choice when dealing with certain functions. Pizer <ref> [15] </ref> has described how position, radius, and orientation are natural parameters to separate for modeling shape. The maximum convexity height ridge does not guarantee such separation. 2. The incommensurability of position, radius and orientation can provide for non-Euclidean geometries in the domain of M . <p> The marching cores algorithm continues this loop until there are no more cubes to process.
