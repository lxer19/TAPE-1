Abstract: In this paper error bounds are derived for a first order expansion of the LU factorization of a perturbation of the identity. The results are applied to obtain perturbation expansions of the LU, Cholesky, and QR factorizations. y Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742.

Reference-contexts: Thus the bounds of this paper will hold for the Frobenius norm, the 1-norm, and the 1 norm, but not for the 2-norm (for more on these norms see <ref> [3] </ref>). 1 2 The Perturbation of Matrix Factorizations 2. Perturbation of the Identity The heart of this note is the observation that the LU factorization of the matrix I + F , where F is small, has a simple perturbation expansion.
