Abstract: We present an algorithmic control methodology called finger tracking for in-hand manipulation of three dimensional objects by independent robot fingers. We describe and analyze the differential control for finger tracking and show how it is used to generate on-line continuous control for the fingers. We show that the control for this problem reduces to solving a linear system of equations. We also analyze the structure of singularities for this problem and discuss how it relates to global control issues for finger tracking. Our result is a contribution towards defining high-level primitives for task-level manipulation with robots.

Reference-contexts: An initial grasp with which the object can be manipulated away from the support is first chosen. This grasp is then continuously altered until envelopment is achieved, under the quasi-static assumption. The role of finite slip between a grasped object and a robot hand has also been discussed in <ref> [Bro87] </ref>. A Lie-algebraic formulation of the dynamics and kinematics for the infinitesimal motions resulting from the interaction between robot fingers in contact with smooth objects has been discussed in [LHS89, Li89, LCS89]. In [LHS89] an algorithm for coordinated finger motions based on the computed torque method is proposed.

Of great interest are the conditions that result in physically realizable force values for a large period of time.

Reference-contexts: The notation used in this paper and some algebraic background are included as an appendix. The global issues that relate the choice of an initial grasp to the tracking curve, and the a priori planning of finger tracking curves are investigated in <ref> [BR93] </ref>. An implementation of a variant of finger tracking for coordinated reorientations of three dimensional extruded 3 objects with mobile robots has been described in [DJR93a, RDJ95]. 1.2 Related Work Reorientation is a class of motion planning problems. <p> Each finger contacts the object at a point with or without friction. The rest of the paper formalizes and solves the reorientation problem for this particular instantiation. Results related to this work have been reported in [Rus92a, Rus92b, Rus92c]. Question (4) has been answered positively in <ref> [BR93] </ref>. 3 A methodology for synthesizing manipulation algo rithms The focus of this section is on reorientations, specifically on how to effect and measure object rotations. We say that two congruent objects have equivalent orientation if there is a translation that takes one into the other. <p> In this section we show an algorithm for determining the instantaneous motion of the tracking finger, given an initial grasp and a desired axis of rotation. In Section 4.8 we show an iterative method for generating tracking motions. In <ref> [BR93] </ref> we show that the differential solution relates to the global issues, like choosing an initial grasp and determining a priori the tracking curve. For the sake of simplicity, in this section we assume that the grasp is such that an instantaneous motion will cause any contacts to be broken. <p> The infeasible solutions can be eliminated by appending the system with the appropriate inequalities that enforce f 0 &gt; 0; f 1 &gt; 0; f 2 &gt; 0; f 3 &gt; 0. The properties of the appended system may be analyzed with standard linear programming techniques. In <ref> [BR93] </ref> the structure of the singularities of the system has been analized. The result of the theorem contains the main motivation for why this is a good scheme to generate rotations by finger tracking and gives an explicit solution. <p> By examining these graphs it is clear that the parameter dependency of this problem is complex. At the same time, it is clear that understanding this dependency is crucial in answering global questions about the behavior of the problem <ref> [BR93] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We also wish our algorithm to consider (i) control uncertainty, (ii) full (not quasi-static) dynamics, and (iii) errors in the geometric model. The reorientation problem is a motion planning problem [Lat91]. However, under control uncertainty the general motion planning problem has been shown to be intractable in 3d <ref> [CR87] </ref>. With full dynamics, the reorientation problem is also a kinodynamic problem. However, kinodynamic planning in full generality is also intractable in 3d [CDRX88, Xav92]. For these reasons, we direct our effort towards defining subclasses of tractable tasks that admit efficient algorithms.

In our more recent work <ref> [RDJ95, DJR93a] </ref>, we have implemented and analyzed a system of mobile robots that can perform reorientations of large objects using the tracking control algorithm described in this paper. Each mobile robot can be viewed as a "finger" contacting the object. <p> A practical outcome of this work is the demonstration that finger tracking is a high-level primitive for dexterous manipulation. Though this paper only presents simulation results, an implementation and analysis of finger tracking strategies in the plane for extruded objects has been described in <ref> [DJR93a, RDJ95] </ref>. Our main goal was to analyze the feasibility of one-step rotations by finger tracking. We did so by relating the singularity analysis of instantaneous finger tracking to geometry, task mechanics, and global motions. <p> Robustness in the presence of model uncertainty is another natural question, as is the companion one of stability. We are currently investigating an experimental aspect of reorientation by tracking in the realm of large scale manipulation with mobile robots.

We are analyzing how the results of this paper pertain to multi-step finger tracking strategies.

Reference-contexts: The object is in an equilibrium grasp if the forces applied by the three fingers intersect. If one of the fingers is displaced but continues to apply a normal force, a net torque is generated and the object rotates to an equilibrium grasp <ref> [Mas81, RC81] </ref>. The continuous pushing displacement of the finger results in a continuous rotation. The object in the previous example (Figure 1) can be moved from its initial to its final orientation by a similar control strategy. <p> The values obtained by solving the linear system are the parameters needed by a hybrid-controller to actually generate a desired motion. Hybrid control was first introduced by <ref> [Mas81, RC81] </ref>. Our notion of hybrid control for a robot finger in contact with a surface consists of exerting position control in the two directions tangent to the surface and force control in the direction normal to the surface.

Reference-contexts: The object is in an equilibrium grasp if the forces applied by the three fingers intersect. If one of the fingers is displaced but continues to apply a normal force, a net torque is generated and the object rotates to an equilibrium grasp <ref> [Mas81, RC81] </ref>. The continuous pushing displacement of the finger results in a continuous rotation. The object in the previous example (Figure 1) can be moved from its initial to its final orientation by a similar control strategy. <p> The values obtained by solving the linear system are the parameters needed by a hybrid-controller to actually generate a desired motion. Hybrid control was first introduced by <ref> [Mas81, RC81] </ref>. Our notion of hybrid control for a robot finger in contact with a surface consists of exerting position control in the two directions tangent to the surface and force control in the direction normal to the surface.

Reference-contexts: An implementation of a variant of finger tracking for coordinated reorientations of three dimensional extruded 3 objects with mobile robots has been described in <ref> [DJR93a, RDJ95] </ref>. 1.2 Related Work Reorientation is a class of motion planning problems. Much work relevant to ours has been done in general motion planning, manipulation planning, and grasp planning. We have adopted the language for motion planning of [LMT84, Don89]. <p> Grasp planning algorithms that treat uncertainty include [Bro88, Gol90]. A survey of the grasping results can be found in [Per89]. New techniques for computing force-closure grasps have also been described in [SP95, PBR95]. In our more recent work <ref> [RDJ95, DJR93a] </ref>, we have implemented and analyzed a system of mobile robots that can perform reorientations of large objects using the tracking control algorithm described in this paper. Each mobile robot can be viewed as a "finger" contacting the object. <p> A practical outcome of this work is the demonstration that finger tracking is a high-level primitive for dexterous manipulation. Though this paper only presents simulation results, an implementation and analysis of finger tracking strategies in the plane for extruded objects has been described in <ref> [DJR93a, RDJ95] </ref>. Our main goal was to analyze the feasibility of one-step rotations by finger tracking. We did so by relating the singularity analysis of instantaneous finger tracking to geometry, task mechanics, and global motions. <p> Robustness in the presence of model uncertainty is another natural question, as is the companion one of stability. We are currently investigating an experimental aspect of reorientation by tracking in the realm of large scale manipulation with mobile robots. Our preliminary findings have been reported in <ref> [DJR93a, RDJ95, JR93] </ref>. Much work is yet to be done. We are analyzing how the results of this paper pertain to multi-step finger tracking strategies.

Reference-contexts: Consider an intricate assembly task. Parts of different shapes have to be joined together in a complex unit. The order in which the parts are added to the subassembly can be computed with the algorithm proposed in <ref> [Wil92] </ref>. The task can be executed by a multi-finger robot hand (see Figure 1). Suppose the next step in the assembly is to add a parallelepipedal part into a hole. The robot hand executing this operation first picks the part up (Figure 1, left).

Reference-contexts: The reorientation problem is a motion planning problem [Lat91]. However, under control uncertainty the general motion planning problem has been shown to be intractable in 3d [CR87]. With full dynamics, the reorientation problem is also a kinodynamic problem. However, kinodynamic planning in full generality is also intractable in 3d <ref> [CDRX88, Xav92] </ref>. For these reasons, we direct our effort towards defining subclasses of tractable tasks that admit efficient algorithms. Perhaps surprisingly, our more specific reorientation problem can be solved efficiently despite the discouraging lower bounds known for the general problem.
