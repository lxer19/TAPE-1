Abstract: Multiple research directions in the past have emphasized the benefits of multidesti-nation message passing to support efficient non-personalized communication like broadcast and multicast. In this paper, we investigate whether personalized communications like scatter can benefit by using multidestination message-passing support, if available in a system. In order to use such support, we propose a new approach where personalized data for a set of destinations can be grouped together and sent as a single multidestination broadcast/multicast worm. This approach is shown to use less number of communication steps while achieving the lower bound for scatter communication. Using this approach, we propose two schemes, sequential multidestination tree-based (SMT) and hierarchical multidestination tree-based (HMT), to implement one-to-all scatter in k-ary n-cube wormhole systems. Performance of these two schemes are compared with two commonly used unicast-based schemes, sequential tree-based (ST) and binomial tree-based (BT). Analytical and simulation studies are carried out to determine the scatter latency under the four schemes for k-ary n-cube systems with varying communication start-up times (t s ), propagation times (t p ), and message lengths (l, size of data being sent to each destination). The study indicates that for l t s t p , both ST and SMT perform better than other algorithms. Simulation results on an 8 fi 8 system with t s =10.0 microsec show that the HMT and SMT schemes reduce scatter latency up to a factor of 30 and 8 compared to the ST scheme for small message lengths. These results

Reference-contexts: Such systems are being used for supporting either distributed-memory, shared-memory, or distributed-shared memory programming paradigms. The need for collective communication operations such as broadcast, multicast, global reduction, scatter, gather, complete exchange, and barrier synchronization arises frequently in parallel applications <ref> [33, 7, 2, 3, 15, 23, 26] </ref>. The usage of collective communication operations simplify the programming of parallel applications and facilitate the implementation of efficient and portable communication schemes on different machines. The Message Passing Interface Standard [25] has recently defined the importance of collective communication operations. <p> MPP systems falling into this category include Meiko [4] and NEC Cenju [20]. Networks of Workstations supporting ATM switching [1] also provide such support.

These operations include multicast, broadcast, reduction, and barrier synchronization. <p> Using this approach, we propose two schemes, sequential multidestination tree-based (SMT) and hierarchical multidestination tree-based (HMT), to implement one-to-all scatter in k-ary n-cube wormhole systems. These schemes group destinations along base-routing-conformed-paths (BRCP) <ref> [34] </ref> in a system. In order to develop the best possible algorithms using multidestination message-passing, we use the lower bound analysis. First we analyze the scatter latencies for unicast-based schemes and determine the conditions under which these schemes achieve the lower bound for scatter communication. <p> In contrast, systems with multidestination message passing allows a multicast/broadcast message to be absorbed at one of the destination nodes while being forwarded (i.e., absorb-and-forward) to the next node concurrently <ref> [22, 34] </ref>. The header of multidestination messages consist of 7 The BT Algorithm Inputs: root: the source node of scatter; msg: the address of the message; l: message length; P: number of participating nodes. <p> A Hamiltonian path-based routing scheme has been introduced in [22] to use multidestination messages. Recently a Base-Routing-Confirmed-Path (BRCP) model has been proposed in <ref> [34] </ref> to apply multidestination message passing to dimension-ordered and other adaptive routing schemes. Formally, the BRCP model can be described as follows. Let us assume a network supporting a deadlock-free routing scheme R for unicast message passing. We identify R as the base-routing.

Reference-contexts: Without loss of generality, and for the rest of this paper, we assume 4 that the original data at the source node is ordered in a column-major fashion. Let us try to estimate the lower bound for this communication. Consider contemporary parallel systems like IBM SP2 <ref> [35] </ref> and Cray T3E, which provide single injection channel per node. In such systems with P processors and message size of l bytes, in the best case, at least one message needs to be sent out.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown recently that current collective communication libraries use either a sequential tree-based (ST) scheme or binomial tree-based (BT) scheme to support scatter communication. Both of these algorithms use only unicast messages. The ST scheme is used on IBM SP2 under the MPICH implementation <ref> [29, 36] </ref> and the BT scheme under the MPL implementation [36]. New generation interconnection networks are providing hardware support for multicast-ing. MPP systems falling into this category include Meiko [4] and NEC Cenju [20].

In this algorithm the source node sends a separate message to each of the other processors participating in scatter. Therefore, the number of required communication steps is P 1. Figure 2a shows the sequential tree for a system with 9 processors. <p> Such an algorithm is used in the MPL library <ref> [36] </ref> on IBM SP2 for scatter implementation. In this approach, the number of processors which receive the message is doubled in each communication step. Figure 4 illustrates the BT algorithm on an 8-processor system.
