Title: Nonlinear Wavelet Transforms for Image Coding  
Author: Roger Claypoole Geoffrey Davis Wim Sweldens Richard Baraniuk 
Abstract: We examine the central issues of invertibility, stability, artifacts, and frequency-domain characteristics in the construction of non-linear analogs of the wavelet transform. The lifting framework for wavelet construction motivates our analysis and provides new insight into the problem. We describe a new type of nonlinearity for use in constructing non-linear transforms: a set of linear predictors that are chosen adaptively using a non-linear selection function. We also describe how earlier families of non-linear filter banks can be extended through the use of prediction functions operating on a causal neighborhood. We present preliminary results for a synthetic test image.

Reference-contexts: We can prevent such propagation by again using a DPCM-like strategy of using quantized data from the causal neighborhood for making predictions in the encoder as well as in the decoder. 3.4 Related Work The update-then-predict lifting scheme we describe is related to the Laplacian pyramid of Burt and Adelson <ref> [1] </ref> in which images are represented as a series of prediction residuals, and the predictors are not constrained to being linear. The Laplacian pyramid has the disadvantage that it expands the number of coefficients in the image being transformed by a factor of 4=3.

Reference-contexts: Instead we propose a solution based on Donoho's average-interpolation which fits into the update-predict form of lifting [5, 14]. It leads to the (1; N ) branch of the Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau family which is biorthogonal to the box function <ref> [2] </ref>. Let us consider a simple example. The low pass coefficients are computed using a Haar filter: L [n] = (x [2n] + x [2n + 1])=2: The high pass coefficients are the residuals of a prediction of the odd samples based on the L [n].

Reference-contexts: It should be emphasized that lifting is a general construction that is not limited to the Deslauriers-Dubuc family. Using the Euclidean algorithm, one can decompose any FIR wavelet transform into a sequence of prediction and update steps <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 Nonlinear Lifting The analysis filters used for wavelet compression applications typically correspond to fourth order polynomial predictors like the one described above. Such predictions work well if the underlying signal is locally smooth.

Reference-contexts: Such non-linear wavelet transforms allow for more flexibility in image representations. Construction of non-linear filter banks is a straightforward process and has been discussed in [7] and [6]. Experiments with a nonlinear filter bank for image coding presented in <ref> [4] </ref> show results that are quite promising. <p> The Laplacian pyramid has the disadvantage that it expands the number of coefficients in the image being transformed by a factor of 4=3. Lifting, on the other hand, guarantees a critically sampled decomposition. Our non-linear lifting framework generalizes the ideas of de Quieroz et al. <ref> [4] </ref>, and makes clear the relationship between the non-linear filter banks described by these authors and the wavelet transform. The filter bank described in [4] uses the update function U 0 and a non separable prediction function P that returns the median of its arguments. <p> Lifting, on the other hand, guarantees a critically sampled decomposition.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, trying to boost the smoothness of the new building blocks leads to needlessly long filters which cause ringing.

In numerical experiments the order (1; 7) filter set has been found to yield performance approaching that of the 7-9 filter set that is more commonly used in coding applications.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In his classic treatise on the workings of the human visual system, Marr focuses on the importance of the representation of information for various cognitive tasks <ref> [9] </ref>. The way in which information is represented brings out certain types of features while hiding others. Image compresion applications also rely heavily on having an efficient representation of image data.

The main 1 feature of lifting is that it provides an entirely spatial interpretation of the wavelet transform, as opposed to the more traditional Fourier based constructions. This spatial interpretation will enable us to construct spatially varying and adaptive or non-linear wavelet transforms. <p> In the example U (H) had to be chosen as (H [n 2] + 9H [n 1] + 9H [n] + H [n + 1])=32. While it is known how to adjust U for a spatially varying, but linear P <ref> [12] </ref>, it is not immediately clear how to build a non-linear U adjusted to a non-linear P . 2. We need to ensure that the transform is stable. Lossy coding schemes introduce errors into the transform coefficients, so it is crucial that the nonlinearities do not unduly amplify these errors.

In particular, if the update filter is one half the adjoint of the predict filter then the primal wavelet has N zero moments as well <ref> [13] </ref>. A simple example of lifting is the construction of the Deslauriers-Dubuc family of wavelets from a single prediction step followed by a single update step.
