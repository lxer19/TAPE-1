Abstract: Changes in lighting conditions strongly effect the performance and reliability of computer vision systems. We report face recognition results under drastically changing lighting conditions for a computer vision system which concurrently uses a contrast sensitive silicon retina and a conventional, gain controlled CCD camera. For both input devices the face recognition system employs an elastic matching algorithm with wavelet based features to classify unknown faces. To assess the effect of analog on-chip preprocessing by the silicon retina the CCD images have been digitally preprocessed with a bandpass filter to adjust the power spectrum. The silicon retina with its ability to adjust sensitivity increases the recognition rate up to 50 percent. These comparative experiments demonstrate that preprocessing with an analog VLSI silicon retina generates image data enriched with object-constant features.

Reference-contexts: The other extreme of large diffusivity between horizontal cells pronounces edges and enhances the contrast gain. The retina chip has a resolution of 90 fi 92 pixels, it was designed by <ref> (Boahen, Andreou, 1992) </ref> and fabricated in 2m n-well technology by MOSIS. 3 Elastic Matching Algorithm for Face Recognition Elastic matching is a pattern classification strategy which explicitly accounts for local distortions. A prototype template is elastically deformed to measure local deviations from a new, unknown pattern.

Reference-contexts: Elastic matching has been shown to perform well on the face classification task recognizing up to 80 different faces reliably (Lades et al., 1993) and in a translation, size and rotation invariant fashion <ref> (Buhmann et al., 1990) </ref>. The face recognition algorithm was initially suggested as a simplified version of the Dynamic Link Architecture (von der Malsburg, 1981), an innovative neural classification strategy with fast changes in the neural connectivity during recognition stage.

Reference-contexts: The rubbersheet-like behavior of the prototype transformation makes elastic matching a particularly attractive method for face recognition where ubiquitous local distortions are caused for example by perspective changes and different facial expressions. Originally, the technique was developed for handwritten character recognition <ref> (Burr, 1981) </ref>. The version of elastic matching employed for our face recognition experiments is based on attributed graph matching. A detailed description with a plausible interpretation in neural networks terms is published in (Lades et al., 1993).
