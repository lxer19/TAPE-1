Abstract: Connection Admission Control (CAC) is needed in ATM networks to provide Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees to real-time connections. This paper presents a CAC scheme based on a bit-stream traffic model, which is capable of modeling traffic generation patterns of CBR/VBR connections and traffic distortions within a network, and worst-case queueing analysis to obtain cell queueing delay bounds. The proposed CAC scheme can be used to establish hard real-time connections in ATM networks with conventional static priority FIFO queueing switches. The effectiveness of the scheme is illustrated by applying it to RTnet, an ATM-based real-time plant control network currently being developed by the Mitsubishi Electric Corporation.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) <ref> [1] </ref> is a promising technology to provide integrated services for high-speed digital communication networks. Its ability to support high bandwidth, high reliability, and guaranteed quality of service communication makes it an ideal network for supporting many distributed real-time applications.

Reference-contexts: Real-time traffic can also be bursty. It causes over reservation of network resources if one assigns a CBR connection with a bandwidth equal to the peak rate that traffic may be generated. The Variable Bit Rate (VBR) service as defined by the ATM Forum <ref> [2] </ref> is more suitable for bursty real-time traffic. The traffic model for a VBR connection is described by a peak cell rate (PCR), a sustainable cell rate (SCR), and a maximum bursty size (MBS).

Reference-contexts: The VBR service can support bursty real-time communication better than the CBR service, but it is also more difficult to perform connection admission control for real-time VBR connections.

Most results, however, require transmission scheduling and/or shaping mechanisms which have not been implemented in most of the existing ATM switches.

Easier delay bound calculation : explicit algorithms are given for the calculation of worst-case queueing delays which, unlike that of <ref> [9] </ref>, do not require a maximum operation on a complex (and sometimes not easy to obtain) function over a continuous interval.
