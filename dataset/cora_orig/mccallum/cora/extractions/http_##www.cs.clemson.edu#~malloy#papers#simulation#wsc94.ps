Abstract: PVM system. Table 3 shows that the average num-ber of messages sent for Model Three using UDP and TCP communication in PVM was the same. However, Table 4 shows that Model Three using TCP communication performed better than Model Three using UDP communication. Since TCP communication requires less overhead than UDP communication, our shot clock technique may perform better in a system that exacts a lower cost for communication. In this paper, we presented the design and implementation of a distributed parallel simulation of a traffic network problem. We constructed our parallel computer using PVM on a network of Sun workstations. Since communication cost using PVM is high, we investigated the effects of increasing the granularity of computation performed by each processor in the parallel execution of the simulation program. We also investigated the effects of increasing the granularity of messages while decreasing their frequency. Our results show that increasing the amount of computation that each processor performs can offset the high cost of communication. We use a shot clock to control the frequency and grain of the messages passed in our parallel system. Our results show that by packing more cars in each message and decreasing the frequency of the messages, we can achieve better speed up. Our results show further that in a system with faster communication, the shot clock can achieve even better results. Baezner, D., C. Rohs, and H. Jones. 1992. U. S. Army MODSIM on Jade's Time Warp.
