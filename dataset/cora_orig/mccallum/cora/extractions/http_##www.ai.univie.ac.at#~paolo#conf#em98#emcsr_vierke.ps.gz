Abstract: In this paper we describe TeleTruck, a multiagent dispatching system that was developed in close cooperation with a forwarding company and that is capable of handling real-world requirements like dynamics and uncertainty. The main idea underlying the TeleTruck approach is the usage of holonic agents, i.e. agents composed of sub-agents that act in a corporated way. We describe the implementation in detail and point out the advantages of the holonic paradigm.

Reference-contexts: Because of this demand and its natural distribution the dispatch problem is a highly promising area for distributed AI technology. In this paper we describe our approach taken in the TeleTruck system. TeleTruck is an extended reimplementation of the MAS-MARS system <ref> [ Fischer et al., 1996 ] </ref> , which is a research prototype for transportation scheduling. MAS-MARS implements an abstract, simplified version of the dispatch problem. The agents of MAS-MARS represent homogeneous trucks. <p> We adopted these benchmarks for multi-agent systems to explore the distributed problem solving capabilities of cooperative agents and to compare it with the OR solutions. It turned out that the solutions obtained by MAS can compete with the OR solutions <ref> [ Fischer et al., 1996 ] </ref> . The general idea of a MAS solution for these scheduling problems is to model each truck by an agent that has the capability to compute a route for executing a subset of the orders. <p> By successively announcing the tasks to the truck agents via the contract net protocol, an initial solution is obtained. In general, this solution is suboptimal. It can be improved by coordinated exchange of orders among the trucks <ref> [ Bachem et al., 1992; Fischer et al., 1996 ] </ref> . In every day business of transportation companies the idealised setting of the benchmark has to be extended: New orders arrive during the execution of the orders and have to be incorporated into existing plans quickly. <p> Whenever the plan of a holon is finished the components separate and the PnEU terminates. The Optimisation In the MAS-MARS system the simulated trading algorithm [ Bachem et al., 1992 ] was used to improve the suboptimal initial solution stepwise towards globally optimised plans <ref> [ Fischer et al., 1996 ] </ref> . Simulated trading is a randomised algorithm that realises a market mechanism where the vehicles optimise their plans by successively selling and buying tasks. The trading goes over several rounds. Each round consists of a number of decision cycles. <p> Therefore, TeleTruck also supports monitoring of the schedule during execution and allows for online re-planning when changes take place. Compared to other software supporting order dispatching, it had been shown earlier <ref> [ Fischer et al., 1996 ] </ref> , that the MAS-MARS/TeleTruck approach can easily compete with traditional OR algorithms. The features of TeleTruck mentioned above, however, allow for much wider usage and better assistance of dispatch officers. An intensive field trial has to demonstrate also its practical superiority.

Reference-contexts: This resulted in a concept which we would like to call a holonic MAS. 3 Holonic MAS The word "holon" <ref> [ Koestler, 1989 ] </ref> is derived from the Greek holos (whole), where the suffix means particle or part. A holon is a natural or artificial structure that is stable and coherent and that consists of several holons as substructures.

Reference-contexts: These ideas are certainly not unfamiliar to the mul-tiagent community since Marvin Minsky proposed his vision of the mind as a society of agents in <ref> [ Minsky, 1985 ] </ref> and tried to show how human intelligence could evolve from the neuronal structures of the brain. His approach was to show how complex cognitive tasks can be decomposed into simpler ones that can then be performed by simple, non-intelligent computational structures called agents.
