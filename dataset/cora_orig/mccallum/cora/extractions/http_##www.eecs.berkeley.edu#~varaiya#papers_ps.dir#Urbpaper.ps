Title: An empirical Internet traffic study  
Author: J. Aracil, R. Edell, P. Varaiya 
Keyword: TCP flow control mechanism significantly affects TCP heavy-tailed behavior.

Abstract: One day's worth of WAN Telnet and FTP connections from the Berkeley campus is analyzed. The main conclusions of the analysis are these. A wide diversity of use offers opportunities to reduce bandwidth by traffic shaping and shifting. Second, connection size and duration are heavy-tailed. Third, Telnet packet arrivals are heavy-tailed, but FTP packet arrivals are not. Both Telnet and FTP connection births have exponential interarrivals, although they are not correlated. Lastly, the

Reference-contexts: Assuming such server represents a transmission link we are measuring network traffic as in our real measurement scenario. We produce variance-aggregation level log-log plots of the packet counting process and we also calculate the Whittle estimator <ref> [1] </ref> for the parameter H n for several multiplexed FTP-data connections 6 using the aggregation method with 95% confidence intervals. network (utilization factor of 0.7). During our busy hour, the average network load was estimated to be 0.3.

Reference-contexts: Next we shift the latter traffic to those times where the traffic is of below-average intensity. This shift reduces the peak 20-minute average intensity by 23%. Such shift would of course require much larger buffers or incentives that cause users to shift the traffic. For further detail, see <ref> [3] </ref> 3 Connection duration, size We study Telnet, FTP control, and FTP data connections. The duration of these TCP connections is defined to be the time between SYN (connection start) and FIN (connection end) packets. 1 Size is the number of bytes transmitted in the connection.

This relates to the model presented in [7], where a second-order self-similar process is constructed with the counting process of Poisson arriving bursts with heavy-tailed distribution.

We observe heavy-tailed behavior for all three of them. When transmission time is small, file transmission is fast compared to user think time.
