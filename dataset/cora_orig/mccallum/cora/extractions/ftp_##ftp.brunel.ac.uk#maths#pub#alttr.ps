Title: Alternating cycles and trails in 2-edge-coloured complete multigraphs  
Author: Jtrgen Bang-Jensen Gregory Gutin 
Abstract: We consider edge-coloured multigraphs. A trail in such a multi-graph is alternating if its successive edges differ in colour. Let G be a 2-edge-coloured complete graph and let M be a 2-edge-coloured complete multigraph. M. Bankfalvi and Zs. Bankfalvi [2] obtained a necessary and sufficient condition for G to have a Hamiltonian alternating cycle. Generalizing this theorem, P. Das and S.B. Rao [7] characterized those G which contain a closed alternating trail visiting each vertex v in G exactly f(v) &gt; 0 times. We solve the more general problem of determining the length of a longest closed alternating trail T f visiting each vertex v in M at most f (v) &gt; 0 times. Our result is a generalization of a theorem by R. Saad [18] that determines the length of a longest alternating cycle in G. We prove the existence of a polynomial algorithm for finding the desired trail T f . In particular, this provides a solution to a question in [18].

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we shall often deal with 2-edge-coloured multigraphs rather than 2-edge-coloured graphs.

Bankfalvi <ref> [2] </ref> obtained a necessary and sufficient condition for G to have a Hamiltonian alternating cycle. Generalizing this theorem, P. Das and S.B.

Then, G is Hamiltonian if and only if neither C 1 !C 2 nor C 2 !C 1 .

Reference-contexts: Indeed, find maximum matchings in the red and blue subgraphs of L. Obviously, L has a spanning cycle subgraph iff both subgraphs have perfect matchings. The complexity bound follows from that of the algorithm for finding a maximum matching in a general graph described in <ref> [10] </ref>. 2. Now we are ready to give a proof of Theorem 3.5. We will make use of the following simple lemma whose easy proof is left to the reader.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, if f (x) = 1 for every x 2 V (G), then the problem of finding a maximum connected f -subgraph of G coincides with the longest alternating cycle problem. By Kotzig's characterization of edge-coloured graphs which contain connected alternating Eulerian trails (cf. <ref> [11, 16] </ref>), every connected f -subgraph of G can be viewed as a closed alternating trail in G visiting each vertex x in G at most f (x) times and vise versa.

Reference-contexts: The fact that (X j X j ) = 1; (Y j Y j ) = 2 follows from the proof of Lemma 4.1. Using the proof of Lemma 4.2, the proof above can be converted into an O (n 2 )-algorithm similar to that in <ref> [13] </ref>, p. 12. Now the complexity bound 8 of the lemma follows from a simple fact that one can find a spanning cycle subgraph (if any) in a 2-edge-coloured multigraph L in time O (jV (L)j 2:5 ). Indeed, find maximum matchings in the red and blue subgraphs of L.

By Kotzig's characterization of edge-coloured graphs which contain connected alternating Eulerian trails (cf. <ref> [11, 16] </ref>), every connected f -subgraph of G can be viewed as a closed alternating trail in G visiting each vertex x in G at most f (x) times and vise versa.

It is easy to see that Theorem 3.4 follows from Proposition 5.1. Proposition 5.1 Let G = (V; E) be a connected 2-edge-coloured multigraph and let x and y be distinct vertices of G.

The following result, which is the main result of this paper, generalizes a characterization of longest alternating cycles in 2-edge-coloured graphs <ref> [18] </ref> (see Corollary 3.6). We prove Theorem 3.5 in Section 4. Theorem 3.5 The length of a longest alternating cycle in a colour-connected extended 2-edge-coloured complete multigraph G is equal to the number of vertices in a maximum cycle subgraph of G. <p> Given a maximum cycle subgraph of a colour-connected G 2 ECM, a longest alternating cycle in G can be constructed in in time O (n 3 ), where n is the number of vertices in G.

The following theorem is proved in Section 5. <p> The following proof is shorter and simpler than the original proof of Corollary 3.6 in <ref> [18] </ref> since we show that there is always a 'suitable' alternating path from C p to the rest of cycles in F (see the proof below). <p> From any augmenting path P in G xy we can obtain the desired path in G, simply by contracting those edges of M which are on P . 2. The rest of this section is a proof of Theorem 3.3. Saad <ref> [18] </ref> proved that 2-edge-coloured complete graphs are convenient. Below we expand this result to extended 2-edge-coloured complete multi-graphs. It is worth noting that our proof can be adopted to provide a considerably shorter proof of Saad's result above.
