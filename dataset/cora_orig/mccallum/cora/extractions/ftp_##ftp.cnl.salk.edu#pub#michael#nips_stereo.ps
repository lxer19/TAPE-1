Abstract: Local disparity information is often sparse and noisy, which creates two conflicting demands when estimating disparity in an image region: the need to spatially average to get an accurate estimate, and the problem of not averaging over discontinuities. We have developed a network model of disparity estimation based on disparity- selective neurons, such as those found in the early stages of processing in visual cortex. The model can accurately estimate multiple disparities in a region, which may be caused by transparency or occlusion, in real images and random-dot stereograms. The use of a selection mechanism to selectively integrate reliable local disparity estimates results in superior performance compared to standard back-propagation and cross-correlation approaches. In addition, the representations learned with this selection mechanism are consistent with recent neurophysiological results of von der Heydt, Zhou, Friedman, and Poggio [8] for cells in cortical visual area V2. Combining multi-scale biologically-plausible image processing with the power of the mixture-of-experts learning algorithm represents a promising approach that yields both high performance and new insights into visual system function.

Reference-contexts: Nowlan and Sejnowski [6] found that selection units learned to respond strongly to image regions that contained motion energy in several different directions. The role of those selection units is similar to layered analysis techniques for computing support maps in the motion domain (Darrell & Pentland <ref> [1] </ref>). The operation of the dual pathways in our model bears some similar ities to the pathways developed in the motion model of Nowlan and Sejnowski [6]. In the stereo domain, we have found that our selection units develop into edge detectors on a disparity map.

Reference-contexts: The motion problem was readily adapted to stereopsis by changing the time domain of motion to the left/right image domain for stereopsis. Our model (Figure 1) consisted of several stages and computed its output using only feed-forward processing, as described below (see also Gray, Pouget, Zemel, Nowlan, and Sejnowski <ref> [2] </ref> for more detail). The output of the first stage (disparity energy filters) became the input to two different primary pathways: (1) the local disparity networks, and (2) the selection networks. <p> Part of the difficulty with this stimulus (containing two objects) was fitting the sum of 2 Gaussians to 4 data points. We have compared our mixture-of-experts model (containing both a selection pathway and a local disparity pathway) with standard backpropagation and cross- correlation techniques (Gray et al <ref> [2] </ref>). The primary difference is that the backpropagation and cross-correlation models have no separate selection mechanism. In essence, one mechanism must compute both the segmentation and the disparity estimation. <p> We have also found that the model matches psychophysical data recorded by Wes- theimer and McKee [9] on the effects of spatial frequency filtering on disparity thresholds (Gray et al <ref> [2] </ref>). They found, in human psychophysical experiments, that disparity thresholds increased for any kind of spatial frequency filtering of line targets. In particular, disparity sensitivity was more adversely affected by high-pass filtering than by low-pass filtering.

Reference-contexts: The model's ability to discriminate among different disparities was quantified as the disparity threshold | the disparity difference at which one can correctly see a difference in depth 75% of the time. Disparity thresholds for the test stimuli were computed using signal-detection theory (Green & Swets <ref> [3] </ref>). Sample stimuli and their disparity thresholds are shown in Table 1. The model performed best on single object stimuli (top row). This disparity threshold (0.23 pixels) was substantially less than the input resolution of the model (1 pixel) and was thus exhibiting stereo hyperacuity.

Reference-contexts: The activation of each of the four disparity-tuned output units in the model was the product of the outputs of the two primary pathways (summed across space). An objective function based on the mixture-of-experts framework (Jacobs, Jordan, Nowlan, & Hinton <ref> [4] </ref>) was used to optimize the weights from the disparity energy units to the local disparity networks and to the selection networks. The weights to the output units from the local disparity and selection pathways were fixed at 1.0.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION In many stereo algorithms, the local correlation between images from the two eyes is used to estimate relative depth (Jain, Kasturi, & Schunk <ref> [5] </ref>). Local correlation measures, however, convey no information about the reliability of a particular disparity measurement. In the model presented here, we introduce a separate selection mechanism to determine which locations of the visual input have consistent disparity information.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we discuss these findings, and consider remaining open questions. 2 MIXTURE-OF-EXPERTS MODEL The model of stereopsis that we have explored is based on the filter model for motion detection devised by Nowlan and Sejnowski <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These images were the input to disparity energy filters, as developed by Ohzawa, DeAngelis, and Freeman <ref> [7] </ref>. At the energy filter layer, there were 51 receptive field (RF) locations which received input from partially overlapping regions of the retinae. At each of these RF locations, there were 30 energy units corresponding to 10 phase differences at 3 spatial frequencies. These phase differences were proportional to disparity.

Reference-contexts: This type of detector can be behaviorally significant, because disparity contrast may play a role in signaling object boundaries. These selection units could thus provide valuable information in the construction of a 3-D model of the world. Recent neurophysiological studies by von der Heydt, Zhou, Friedman, and Poggio <ref> [8] </ref> is consistent with this interpretation. They found that neurons of awake, behaving monkeys in area V2 responded to edges of 4 ffi by 4 ffi random-dot stere- ograms. Because random-dot stereograms have no monocular form cues, these neurons must be responding to edges in depth.
