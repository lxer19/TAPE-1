Abstract: This paper presents a technique used to do power analysis of a real processor at the architectural level. The target processor integrates a 16-bit DSP and a 32-bit RISC on a single chip. Our power estimator provides power consumption data of the architecture based on the instruction/data flow stream. We demonstrate the accuracy of the estimator by comparing the power values it produces against measurements made by a gate level power simulator for the same benchmark set. Our estimation approach has been shown to provide very efficient, accurate power analysis at the architectural level.

Reference-contexts: Our analysis technique overcomes this loss of accuracy by taking data and instruction streams into account. The processor is separated into many functional units. The energy consumed by each functional unit per access can be computed as follows <ref> [1] </ref> E m = 2 2 where C m is the switch capacitance per access of the functional unit and V dd is the supply voltage. For each active functional unit, C m is calculated from the energy model of the unit based on the previous and present input vectors.

Reference-contexts: The third empirical approach, transition-sensitive energy models, is based on input transitions rather than input statistics. The method presented in <ref> [2] </ref> assumes an energy model is provided for each functional unit a table containing the power consumed for each input transition. The authors give a scheme for collapsing closely related input transition vectors and energy patterns into clusters, thereby reducing the size of the table for each functional unit. <p> A major problem is that the size of this table grows exponentially in the size of the inputs. A clustering algorithm solves this problem and the sub-problems associated with it by compressing similar energy patterns. The details of this algorithm can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. The capacitance data in the energy characterization table is obtained from a switch level simulation of the functional unit. The accuracy of switch level analysis is not as good as circuit level simulation tools, but is much faster.

Reference-contexts: This approach implicitly assumes that the inputs do not affect the switching activity of the hardware block. To remedy this weakness of the fixed-activity approach, activity-sensitive empirical energy models have been developed. They are based on predictable input signal statistics, such as used in the SPA method <ref> [3, 4, 5] </ref>. Although the individual models built in this way are relatively accurate (the error rate is 10% 15%), overall accuracy may be sacrificed for the reasons of unavailable correct input statistics or an inability to model the interactions correctly.

Reference-contexts: Most of the research in this area falls in the category of empirical methods which "measure" the power consumption of existing implementations and produce models based on those measurements. This macromod-eling technique can be subdivided into three subcategories. The first approach introduced in <ref> [7] </ref> is a fixed-activity macromodeling strategy called the Power Factor Approximation (PFA) method. The energy models are parameterized in terms of complexity parameters and a PFA proportionality constant. Thus, the intrinsic internal activity is captured through this PFA constant.
