Abstract: In this paper a speech-to-speech translator from German to English is presented. Beside the traditional processing steps it takes advantage of acoustically detected prosodic phrase boundaries and focus. The prosodic phrase boundaries reduce search space during syntatic parsing, and rule out analysis trees during semantic parsing. The prosodic focus faciliates a "shallow" translation based on the best word chain in cases where the deep analysis fails.

Reference-contexts: The trees found are propagated to the semantic components which build the appropriate semantic representation for the tree. Syntactic and semantic analysis are based on a common integrated grammar specification in the HPSG framework. The distributed grammar processing model presupposed in the system is based on <ref> [3, 8] </ref>. The grammar integrates focus and speech act related information about utterance mood (e.g., interrogative) from prosody [7]. This information is exploited in semantic evaluation for speech act recognition and contextual reference resolution. Speech act recognition uses a finite state dialog model with probabilistic preferences.

Reference-contexts: The recognition rate is 78.5% and the average recognition rate is 66.6%. The focus detection module will send focus hypotheses to the semantic module and to the module for transfer and generation. In a recent approach, phrase boundaries from the detector described above were integrated in the algorithm <ref> [4] </ref>. With help of the phrase boundaries the detection task can be split up so that focus accents for each phrase separately can be determined. The recognition rates are more than 2% higher, depending on the dialogue. After optimization of the algorithm even higher rates are expected. 4.

Reference-contexts: In a traditional deep analysis it gets its input (dialog act and feature structure) from the semantic evaluation module. In an additional path a flat transfer is performed with the best word chain (from the word recognition module) and with focus information <ref> [5] </ref>. During shallow processing the focus accents are aligned to words. If a focus is on a content word a probabilistically selected dialog act is chosen. This dialog act is then expanded to a translation enriched with possible information from the word chain.

Reference-contexts: After optimization of the algorithm even higher rates are expected. 4. SYNTAX PARSER One of the main benefits of prosody in the INTARC system is the use of prosodic phrase boundaries inside the word lattice search. The incremental probabilistic search engine based on <ref> [6] </ref> receives word hypotheses and phrase boundary hypotheses as an input. The input is represented as a chart (i.e. a well formed substring table) where frames correspond to chart vertices and word hypotheses are edges which map to pairs of vertices.

Reference-contexts: Syntactic and semantic analysis are based on a common integrated grammar specification in the HPSG framework. The distributed grammar processing model presupposed in the system is based on [3, 8]. The grammar integrates focus and speech act related information about utterance mood (e.g., interrogative) from prosody <ref> [7] </ref>. This information is exploited in semantic evaluation for speech act recognition and contextual reference resolution. Speech act recognition uses a finite state dialog model with probabilistic preferences. <p> Since prosodic information is not always reliable, but also because prosodic boundaries do not completely coincide with grammatical phrase boundaries, the Sem-Parser was extended by a recovery mechanism, making it possible to reactivate hypotheses excluded by boundary information, thus enabling the derivation of otherwise lost readings <ref> [7] </ref>. By using the recovery mechanism, real boundary hypotheses reduced the average number of readings of a turn by 24.7%. 6. TRANSFER In INTARC the transfer module performs a dialog act based translation.

Reference-contexts: Irregular phrase boundaries are labelled with B9, and the default label for a word boundary is B0. The B2 and B3 boundaries roughly correspond to the linguistic concepts of phrase boundaries, but are not necessarily identical <ref> [11] </ref>. 2. OVERVIEW OF THE SYSTEM Like the VERBMOBIL prototype the INTARC system is a speech-to-speech translator, from German to English.
