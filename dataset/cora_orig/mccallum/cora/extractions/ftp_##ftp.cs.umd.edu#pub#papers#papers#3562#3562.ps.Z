Abstract: Remotely sensed images collected by the satellites are usually contaminated by the effects of the atmospheric particles through absorption and scattering of the radiation from the earth surface. The objective of atmospheric correction is to retrieve the surface reflectance from remotely sensed imagery by removing the atmospheric effects, which is usually performed in two steps. First, the optical characteristics of the atmosphere are estimated and then the remotely sensed imagery is corrected by inversion procedures that derive the surface reflectance. In this paper we introduce an efficient algorithm to estimate the optical characteristics of the Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery and to remove the atmospheric effects from it. Our algorithm introduces a set of techniques to significantly improve the quality of the retrieved images. We pay a particular attention to the computational efficiency of the algorithm, thereby allowing us to correct large TM images quite fast. We also provide a parallel implementation of our algorithm and show its portability and its scalability on several parallel machines.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Remote sensing techniques have been extensively applied in different disciplines. However, the radiation from the earth surface which is highly correlated with surface inherent properties are largely contaminated by the atmosphere.

So far, no operational method is avaliable to remove the atmospheric effects on large scales. A general scheme and some efficient algorithms are described in our previous work [3].

Reference-contexts: It has been demonstrated [1, 2] that the removal of atmospheric effects can significantly improve the accuracy of image classification. So far, no operational method is avaliable to remove the atmospheric effects on large scales. A general scheme and some efficient algorithms are described in our previous work <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> Repeat this procedure until no optical depth is out of bound. end The procedure for determining the aerosol optical depth, given surface reflectance and upward radiance is very similar to the method for determining the surface reflectance given aerosol optical depth and upward radiance <ref> [3] </ref>. We use look-up tables to compute L 0 , F d , T and s (as functions of aerosol optical depth) by interpolation followed by computing the upward radiance (as a function of aerosol optical depth) using Eqn. (1). <p> This can be repeated until we have the optical depth for all the windows. A straightforward implementation of the strategy sketched above coupled with our earlier atmospheric correction algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> reveals a number of shortcomings of the algorithm. These shortcomings include: Large variations in the quality of corrected images. The algorithm performed well only when the atmospheric conditions did not change rapidly, the optical depth was not high, and when the image did not include any cloud or water. <p> these cases, we do not explore this situation further in this study. 10 Band 2, Before Correction Band 2, After Correction Band 3, Before Correction Band 3, After Correction Band 7 11 4 Combining Parameter Estimation and Correc- tion Algorithms In an earlier work, we designed an atmospheric correction algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> that assumed constant optical depth over windows of a suitable size. As we have seen before, this assumption may not always be valid. <p> Furthermore, we should balance the computation among the nodes and minimize the interprocessor communication time. We balance the computation by partitioning each image equally among the processors. To minimize the number of disk accesses <ref> [3] </ref>, each processor during each iteration processes a slab (as opposed to a block) consisting of the maximum possible number of consecutive rows that can fit in its internal memory. More precisely, each processor reads a slab sequentially, process it, and writes back the result.

Reference-contexts: The Thematic Mapper (TM) of Landsats 4 and 5 provides a substantial amount of imagery that has a high spatial resolution (30 meters), and a high spectral resolution and that has been widely used for resource inventory, environmental monitoring, and a variety of applications <ref> [4] </ref>. The spectral characteristics of TM imagery is summarized in Table 1. The first three channels are in the visible spectrum corresponding to blue, green and red. Channels 4 and 5 are in the near-infrared spectrum and channel 7 is a middle-infrared band.

Reference-contexts: correction is to retrieve the surface reflectance from observed pixel values at the top of the atmosphere. 2 Background Assuming that the atmosphere is bounded by a Lambertian surface (i.e., reflects solar energy isotropically), the upward radiance at the top of the cloud-free, horizontally homogeneous atmosphere can be expressed by <ref> [5] </ref> : L m = L 0 + (1 s) 2 Band 1 Band 2 Band 3 Band 4 Band 5 Band 7 3 where L 0 is the upward radiance of the atmosphere with zero surface reflectance (i.e., = 0), often called path radiance, F d is the downward flux <p> depth [9]. 2.2 Surface Reflectance Retrieval Given the aerosol optical depth, the determination of L 0 , F d , T , and s in Eqn. (1) is not a simple task due to the fact that these quantities are related to the solutions 4 of the radiative transfer equation <ref> [5] </ref>, which is an integro-differential equation for which no analytical solution is available. There are several approaches to obtain practical solutions. The first is to use a numerical iterative approach, such as the discrete-ordinate algorithm [10], and the Gauss-Seidel algorithm [11].
