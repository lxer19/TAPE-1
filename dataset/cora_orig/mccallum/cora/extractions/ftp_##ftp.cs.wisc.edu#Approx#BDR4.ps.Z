Abstract: Technical Summary Report #96-06 March, 1996 (updated 03mar97,08aug96) Abstract: A second look at the authors' ([BDR1], [BDR2]) characterization of the approximation order of a Finitely generated Shift-Invariant subspace S() of L 2 (IR d ) results in a more explicit formulation entirely in terms of the (Fourier transform of the) generators ' 2 of the subspace. Further, when the generators satisfy a certain technical condition, then, under the mild assumption that the set of 1-periodizations of the generators is linearly independent, such a space is shown to provide approximation order k if and only if spanf'( j) : jjj &lt; k; ' 2 g contains a (necessarily unique) satisfying D j b (ff) = ffi j ffi ff for jjj &lt; k, ff 2 2ZZ d . The technical condition is satisfied, e.g., when the generators are O(j j ) at infinity for some &gt; k + d. In the case of compactly supported generators, this recovers an earlier result of Jia ([J1], [J2]).

Our studies in [BDR1] and [BDR2] of the approximation orders of FSI spaces were focused on the superfunction approach.

Result 1.2. <p> Our studies in <ref> [BDR1] </ref> and [BDR2] of the approximation orders of FSI spaces were focused on the superfunction approach. The basic result on the matter is Theorem 1.9 of [BDR1], a special case of which, of much use in the present paper, is as follows. Result 1.2. Let S be a closed shift-invariant subspace of L 2 (IR d ). <p> Remark. It should be emphasized that, in this paper, `approximation order' always refers to that provided by the corresponding stationary ladder, S h := S ()(=h), as defined in <ref> [BDR1] </ref>. In the case of refinable functions with dilation matrix s, one may also be interested in the approximation order of the nested sequence V j := S ()(s j ). <p> The characterization extends to the non-stationary case, whose definition is given in the sequel, in a way that is analogous to the non-stationary PSI extensions. The argument we use in the proof of the main result invokes our two main observations from <ref> [BDR1] </ref>, viz., the characterization of the approximation orders of PSI spaces, and the superfunction results such as Result 1.2. We recall the definition of the bracket product of f; g 2 L 2 (IR d ): [f; g] := ff22ZZ d i.e., the 2-periodization of f g. <p> Example. If is the singleton fg, then the function fl reduces to ! 7! (1 [ b ; b ] where here and below, as in <ref> [BDR1] </ref>, we interpret 0=0 to be 0. The above theorem thus covers, as a special case, the characterization of the approximation order provided by stationary PSI ladders that we obtained in [BDR1: Theorem 1.6]. Proof of Theorem 2.2. <p> We will show that, near the origin, the map fl : ! 7! (1 [ b ; b ] coincides with fl . Our present FSI theorem will then follow from its special PSI case, i.e., Theorem 1.6 of <ref> [BDR1] </ref>. To compute fl , note that the error, g , in the orthogonal projection of g to S is necessarily perpendicular to S ( ), hence, e.g. by [BDR1: Lemma 2.8], [bg b ; b ] = 0, i.e., [bg; b ] = [ b ; b ]. <p> The extension of the above result to the non-stationary case is done exactly in the same manner non-stationary extensions were dealt with in <ref> [BDR1] </ref>. We state these results without further comment. Theorem 2.7. Let S be a non-stationary FSI ladder, i.e., the space S h is the h-dilate of the FSI space S ( h ), with h an h-dependent finite subset of L 2 (IR d ). <p> It remains to show that provides approximation order k, and that it is unique. Approximation order: Given any function whose Fourier transform b is k times differentiable around the origin, and is non-vanishing there, Theorem 1.6 of <ref> [BDR1] </ref> shows that the PSI space S () provides approximation order k if and only if [b; b] jbj 2 = ff22ZZ d n0 0 has a zero of order 2k at the origin.

The basic result on the matter is Theorem 1.9 of [BDR1], a special case of which, of much use in the present paper, is as follows. Result 1.2. <p> First, even in case S is generated by a `nice' set , it is not true that the superfunction in the result must inherit any of these favorable properties. Second, the result does not provide any recipe for the construction of . Section 4 of <ref> [BDR2] </ref> deals with these two problems. We state here only its result for the case when S is a local space, i.e., S is generated by finitely many compactly supported functions. <p> Note that the superfunction of this latter result is certainly compactly supported. Moreover, an explicit construction of (one of the many) possible is given in <ref> [BDR2] </ref>. Still, one should keep in mind the following: while in Result 1.3 is compactly supported, 2 its mean value may be 0. From an Approximation Theory point-of-view, this is a major drawback. <p> From an Approximation Theory point-of-view, this is a major drawback. For, it forces any useful approximation scheme that uses the shifts of to be unstable: the coefficients used to approximate, say, a bounded function, can grow at 1. When writing <ref> [BDR2] </ref>, our primary example of a FSI space was one generated by several box splines. In this case, the fact that the compactly supported superfunction has zero mean value seems to be unavoidable. <p> This linear independence requirement is significantly weaker than L 2 -stability (known also as the Riesz basis property) of shifts of (cf. <ref> [BDR2] </ref>): the latter property is characterized by the linear independence of f b j +2ZZ d : 2 g; for every real . The linear independence assumption on the shifts of , used in [HSS] and [CDP], is even stronger than the Riesz basis property. <p> ), the Gramian G := G of is the square matrix indexed by whose (; ')-entry ((; ') 2 fi ) is the corresponding bracket product: G (; ') := [ b'; b ]; notice the inverted order, here and in [RS], as compared to the definition of G in <ref> [BDR2] </ref> (forced upon us because we have, following the customary treatment of inner products, made the bracket product skew-linear in its second argument).

Reference-contexts: In particular, the uniqueness depends on the specification that certain 15 derivatives of b vanish at the origin, and this may be useful when constructing approxima-tion maps based on the shifts of (cf., e.g., <ref> [BR1] </ref>), but may be less important for other applications. Specifically, for a certain application concerning a change of generating sets for a refinable FSI space (that we describe in the next section), the following superfunction result, which differs only slightly from Theorem 4.2, is found useful.

Reference-contexts: For the diagonal entries of G, this smoothness is shown in the proof of Proposition 4.1 in <ref> [R3] </ref> by showing that, for any suitably small neighborhood B of the origin, P j22ZZ d kj b j 2 k C k (j+B) &lt; 1 in case 2 L 2 (IR d ) vanishes to some order &gt; k + d at 1. <p> By Schwarz' Inequality, this implies that also P Therefore (proceeding as in <ref> [R3] </ref>), [ b ; b'] = P j22ZZ d b ( + j) b'( + j) is k times continuously differentiable on B. <p> Thus, in view of the remark at the end of the introduction, requirement (b) here holds if (but not only if) the shifts of are L 2 -stable, a fortiori whenever these shifts are linearly independent. Remark. Property H (k) appears previously in the article <ref> [R3] </ref>, and is defined there differently. Roughly speaking, the definition in [R3] is as follows: "S () satisfies the H (k) property if it provides approximation order k to the entire Sobolev space, the moment it provides approximation order k to some non-zero smooth function"; see [R3] for the precise definition. <p> Remark.

Reference-contexts: Given a finite L 2 (IR d ), the Gramian G := G of is the square matrix indexed by whose (; ')-entry ((; ') 2 fi ) is the corresponding bracket product: G (; ') := [ b'; b ]; notice the inverted order, here and in <ref> [RS] </ref>, as compared to the definition of G in [BDR2] (forced upon us because we have, following the customary treatment of inner products, made the bracket product skew-linear in its second argument).

Reference-contexts: Such results exist for a univariate singleton (cf. [JW], [R2]). Less is known at present in more than one variable (cf.

(It should be emphasized, though, that the problem of characterizing the stronger property of orthonormality of the shifts of , or, more generally, the bi-orthogonality of the shifts of and the shifts of another refinable (dual) system, is more accessible, cf. x3 of <ref> [S] </ref>). In what follows, we invoke the results of the previous section for the study of the above problem. Our analysis is carried out in any number of dimensions d, and under a Strong H (k) property.

Following a suggestion of Babuska, <ref> [SF] </ref> studies the possibility that the approximation orders of the FSI space S are already realized by some PSI subspace S ( ) of it.
