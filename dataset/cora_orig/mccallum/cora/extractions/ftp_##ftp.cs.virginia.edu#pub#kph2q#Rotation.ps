Abstract: 1 ABSTRACT We report results from a formal user study of interactive 3D rotation using the mouse-driven Virtual Sphere and Arcball techniques, as well as direct 3D orientation input techniques based on magnetic orientation sensors. We found that when performing an orientation matching task, users can take advantage of the integrated degrees of freedom of 3D orientation input to complete the task up to 36% faster, without necessarily sacrificing any statistically detectable degree of accuracy. We report detailed observations of user expectations and common usability problems when first encountering the techniques. Our qualitative observations also suggest some design issues for 3D input devices. For example, the physical form-factors of the 3D input device had a marked effect on the subjective user acceptance of otherwise identical input sensors. The device should afford some tactile cues, so the user can feel its orientation without looking at it. In the absence of such cues, some test users were not able to form a clear concept of how to use the device.

Reference-contexts: Our goal is not to reproduce Chens results, but rather to extend the set of interactive 3D rotation techniques that have been formally evaluated with a common task. A static view of a solid-rendered 3D model of a house, at a randomly generated orientation <ref> [1] </ref>, was shown on the left side of the screen (figure 1). Test users attempted to manipulate a second view of the house on the right-hand side of the screen to match the random orientation. Each side of the house was colored uniquely to facilitate the matching.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION With the rapid migration of fast, cheap 3D graphics to the PC platform [26], and with 3D graphics beginning to make their presence felt on the web through standards such as VRML <ref> [3] </ref>, applications which incorporate 3D manipulation and 3D object viewing will become increasingly prevalent. In particular, orienting a virtual object to a desired view is a fundamental task, since viewing or inspecting an object is often a precursor to further manipulation.

Reference-contexts: We do not wish to argue that any one device or technique is best. Each interface device or input technique will excel for some tasks and languish for others <ref> [4] </ref>; the most appropriate device for an application depends on the context of tasks to be supported and the intended users.

Reference-contexts: In particular, orienting a virtual object to a desired view is a fundamental task, since viewing or inspecting an object is often a precursor to further manipulation. Since a 1988 study by Chen which introduced the Virtual Sphere <ref> [5] </ref>, we are not aware of any quantitative data comparing performance of currently proposed techniques for specifying 3D orientation. <p> The magnetic tracker simultaneously provides all three rotational degrees of freedom, so in principle the user never has to mentally compose rotations with this interface. However, it is not clear if users can employ coupled rotation axes effectively <ref> [5] </ref>, nor is it clear if the multiple degrees of freedom result in faster, but possibly less accurate, input of orientation data. The 3D Ball always acted as an absolute rotation controller: the orientation of the object being manipulated always matched the orientation of the 3D Ball. <p> H4: The Arcball includes several apparent improvements over the Virtual sphere. As such, we expect the Arcball to outperform the Virtual sphere in terms of task performance, user acceptance, or both. THE EXPERIMENT Task Our test users performed an orientation matching task based on the task employed by Chen <ref> [5] </ref>. Our goal is not to reproduce Chens results, but rather to extend the set of interactive 3D rotation techniques that have been formally evaluated with a common task. <p> After each trial, performance was rated as Excellent! (shortest-arc rotation less than 5.7 degrees), Good Match! (less than 7.6 degrees), or Not good enough, try harder next time. We chose a foot-pedal to end the trials, rather than the spacebar used by Chen <ref> [5] </ref>. This kept the desk surface open for manipulation and it also allowed test users to use both hands (if desired) to manipulate the 3D input devices. The keyboard was removed from the desk during all experimental conditions. We gave the participants as little instruction as possible with each controller. <p> The 3D Ball was 36% faster than the 2D techniques and the Tracker was 33% faster. There was little variation in the mean accuracies obtained. Comparing to Chens results for the Virtual Sphere, our test users had longer times (Chen reported a mean of 17.5 seconds for complex rotations <ref> [5] </ref>, while we found 27.7 seconds), but our test users were more accurate (Chen reported 8 degrees of error 1 , while our test users achieved 6 degrees). 1. <p> Chen reported accuracy in terms of the sum of squared errors between the users rotation matrix and the rotation matrix to match. Chen indicates a squared error of 0.04 <ref> [5] </ref>, which converts to 8.1 degrees. 0.0 10.0 20.0 30.0 40.0 Arcball Virtual Sphere 3D Ball Tracker Mean Time (sec) 0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0 Arcball Virtual Sphere 3D Ball Tracker Mean Accuracy (deg) 4 These discrepancies are probably primarily due to the differing test user populations: Chen used all

Reference-contexts: This hypothesis arose from our previous and ongoing work with neurosurgeons to develop a free-space 3D interface for medical visualization software <ref> [9] </ref>. Surgeons could more easily learn and use this visualization interface when the 3D input sensors were presented as tools or props which helped the surgeons to reason about their tasks. <p> Affordances: The input device needs to suggest that it serves to orient virtual objects, while at the same time suggesting that it should be picked up, and not used on the desk surface. In our work with neurosurgical visualization <ref> [9] </ref>, a miniature dolls head serves this purpose well: the dolls head just cant be manipulated effectively on the desk surface, and so strongly encourages being picked up. <p> Also, the muscle tension required to press or hold an integrated switch can interfere with the users ability to manipulate the input device. Using a footpedal to separate the button from the device can be an effective alternative <ref> [9] </ref>, and can help to encourage use of the precision grasp. Device acquisition time: Our results suggested that the mouse-based techniques were slower for our experimental task.

Reference-contexts: HYPOTHESES This study was conceived to investigate the following specific hypotheses: H1: Users can effectively use coupled rotation axes, and integrated control of all three degrees-of-freedom for rotation will provide significantly faster input of orientation data. A study by Jacob <ref> [12] </ref> suggests that multiple degree-of-freedom input will be most appropriate when users think of a tasks control parameters as integral attributes; we propose that 3D rotation matching is one such task.

Reference-contexts: It may be possible to eliminate acquisition times in some cases by using a 3D device in the nonpreferred hand. This offers the possibility of working with a 3D device and a mouse at the same time <ref> [13] </ref>, or with a pair of 3D devices simultaneously [9][18][19]. We have also experimented with using a touchscreen in conjunction with 3D input as a means to provide integrated 2D and 3D input in the same user interface [10][11].

Reference-contexts: We see this as an example of how a drawback for one style of input may be a virtue for another. Grasp: Many 3D input device designs encourage the user to hold the device against the palm at a fixed orientation. This is known as the power grasp <ref> [14] </ref> because this hand posture emphasizes strength and security of the grip. By contrast, the precision grasp involves the pads and tips of the fingers 2.

Reference-contexts: Surgeons could more easily learn and use this visualization interface when the 3D input sensors were presented as tools or props which helped the surgeons to reason about their tasks. The input devices took advantage of natural affordances (as discussed by Nor-man <ref> [15] </ref>), which can help users to know what to do just by inspecting or grasping an object or input device.

Reference-contexts: For example, the Sketch system [30] provides a casual, inexact interface and a cleverly chosen set of heuristics which often allows the system to select views of objects based on fast, relatively imprecise 2D mouse clicks. The Jack system <ref> [17] </ref> takes a similar approach by automatically generating unobstructed views of selected objects. Additional work is needed to understand what classes of user tasks are appropriate for each technique, and to determine how to best mingle the two styles in the same interface.

Reference-contexts: It does not suffer from problems with gimbal lock or noisy data, and its implementation affords easy addition of constraint modes. It has sometimes been cited as the best known 2D technique for 3D rotation. Shoemake has performed an informal comparison <ref> [22] </ref>, but no quantitative data currently exist which compare the Arcball and the Virtual Sphere. <p> Arcball vs. Virtual Sphere In theory, there are two primary distinctions between the behavior of Arcball and that of the Virtual Sphere: the Arcball avoids hysteresis effects and the Arcball uses half-length arcs. Hysteresis occurs when closed loops of mouse motion may not produce closed loops of rotation <ref> [22] </ref>. This means that it may not be possible to undo a sequence of drags by reversing their order. Half-length arcs are a property of how rotations combine, and result in a fixed C:D (Control:Display) ratio which is free of hysteresis. <p> Test users tended to prefer the Arcball over the Virtual Sphere, but this advan tage was not significant statistically. These non-results do confirm, however, that the Arcballs possibly confusing concept of half-length arcs does not cause any obvious usability problems <ref> [22] </ref>. This study has focused on manipulative techniques to achieve 3D rotation, but of course direct manipulation (whether 2D or 3D) is not the only approach to orienting and viewing objects.

Reference-contexts: With the addition of a clutching mechanism (for engaging and disengaging the ball from a virtual object), it would be possible to use the 3D Ball as a relative rotation controller, by performing ratchet-ing movements <ref> [29] </ref>. Some other ball-shaped 3D input devices with integrated clutch buttons have used this technique [6][16][25]. Our 3D Ball did not include any inte grated buttons; we will return to the issue of integrated control buttons later in this paper.

Reference-contexts: This issue was formally analyzed by Zhai for a 6 DOF docking task, where it was found that using the fine muscle groups emphasized in the precision grasp results in significantly faster performance <ref> [31] </ref>. The design of a 3D input device can inuence which style of grasp users will choose. Integrating buttons with the input device encourages users to adopt a power grasp, holding the device in the palm, while the fingertips maintain contact with the buttons.
