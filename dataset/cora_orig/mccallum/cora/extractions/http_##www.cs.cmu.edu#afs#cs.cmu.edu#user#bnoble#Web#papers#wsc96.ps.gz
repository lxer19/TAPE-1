Abstract: The loss behavior of wireless networks has become the focus of many recent research efforts. Although it is generally agreed that wireless communications experience higher error rates than wireline, the nature of these lossy links is not fully understood. This paper describes an effort to characterize the loss behavior of the AT&T WaveLAN, a popular in-building wireless interface. Using a trace-based approach, packet loss information is recorded, analyzed, and validated. Our results indicate that WaveLAN experiences an average packet error rate of 2 to 3 percent. Further analysis reveals that these errors are not independent, making it hard to model them with a simple twostate Markov chain. We derive another model based on the distributions of the error and error-free length of the packet streams. For validation, we modulate both the error models and the traces in a simulator. Tracedriven simulations yield an average TCP throughput of about 5 percent less than simulations using our best error model.

Reference-contexts: BACKGROUND Wireless errors are mainly caused by the inability of the receiver to distinguish the transmitted signal from the background noise. The radio propagation patterns and their effect on receiver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) have been studied for both the in-building and outdoor environments <ref> (Andersen, Rappaport, and Yeshiva 1995) </ref>, (Cox and Leck 1975), (Eckhardt and Steenkiste 1996). The detrimental effect of wireless errors on reliable transport protocols has resulted in many efforts to improve the performance of TCP (Bakre and Badrinath 1995), (Balakrishnan, Seshan, and Katz 1995).

Reference-contexts: Since it is difficult to detect a collision while transmitting, WaveLAN implements a collision avoidance scheme, which is different from the CSMA/CA being proposed IEEE 802.11 committee <ref> (Chen 1994) </ref>. After the WIFS, the MAC waits for a random number of antenna slots less than an initial back-off value. If the channel becomes busy before its slot, the MAC doubles its back-off window and continues to monitor the channel for the next contention period.

Reference-contexts: As the result, evaluating wireless network protocols with a uniform error model will likely produce inaccurate results. We investigate several models to capture the burstiness of wireless errors. Starting with the Fritchman binary error model <ref> (Fritchman 1967) </ref>, we develop two models for our trace data. In the following subsection, we describe the twostate Markov model.

Reference-contexts: Having complete control over this network allow us to obtain many devicespecific data that are valuable for channel modeling. 2.2 WaveLAN WaveLAN is a commercial wireless network interface operating in the 902-928 MHz ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) band (AT&T 1993), <ref> (Kohno, Meidan, and Milstein 1995) </ref>. This direct sequence spread spectrum modem has a spreading factor of 11 chips per bit and a maximum bandwidth of about 2 Mbps. WaveLAN does not employ any forward error correction or retransmission at the device level, which makes it appropriate for studying wireless errors.

Reference-contexts: Since both L E G geometrically distributed, the transitional probabilities can be expressed by the following formulas <ref> (Jain 1991) </ref>: p E 1 L GE = The state transitions in the Markov model are memory-less. This nice property allows the transitions to be decided on an individual packet basis.

Reference-contexts: When the trace collection program is executed, it opens a network tracing pseudo-device to start the kernel trace agent. The kernel trace agent then puts the wireless network interfaces (NI) into promiscuous mode to capture all packets, similar to the Berkeley Packet Filter <ref> (McCanne and Jacobson 1993) </ref>. Devicespecific data such as signal level, noise level, signal quality, and error status are also recorded for postprocessing and analysis. 3.2 Workload Generation To generate traffic for error measurements, UDP is preferred over TCP because it has no error-recovery and connection establishment mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: Due to the large number of protocols at different network layers, it is often infeasible to build and measure all of them. A better alternative is to trace the behaviors of existing implementations and apply the lessons learned to evaluate new designs. From wireless network traces <ref> (Noble, Nguyen, Satyanarayanan, and Katz 1996) </ref>, we can improve our understanding of the wireless channel behavior, develop realistic models, and validate them. Traces also provide us a way to reproduce realistic network and mobile environments for comparing protocols and algorithms.
