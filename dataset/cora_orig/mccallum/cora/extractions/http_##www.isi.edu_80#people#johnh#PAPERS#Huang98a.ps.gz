Abstract: Due to the complexity and scale of the current Internet, large-scale simulation is an increasingly important tool to evaluate network protocol design. Parallel and distributed simulation is one appropriate approach to the simulation scalability problem, but it can require expensive hardware and have high overhead. We investigate a complimentary solution - simulation abstraction. Just as a custom simulator includes only details necessary for the task at hand, a general simulator can support configurable levels of detail for different simulations. We demonstrate two abstraction techniques in multicast simulations and show that they each help to gain one order of magnitude in performance. Although abstraction simulations are not identical to more detailed simulations, in many cases these differences are small and result in minimal changes in the conclusions drawn from simulations.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this modular structure can result in significant resource consumption, especially when the simulation scenarios grow. Ahn and Danzig estimated that five minutes of activity on a network the size of todays Internet would require gigabytes of real memory and months of computation on todays 100 MIP uniprocessors. <ref> [3] </ref> One approach to the scalability problem is to apply parallel and distributed simulation, dividing tasks into parts coordinated over numbers of machines. <p> Consequently, the simulation efficiency may be degraded due to the overhead associated with these mechanisms. Although parallel and distributed simulation is useful when large computers are available, alternative techniques such as abstraction are also needed to make very large simulations. Ahn and Danzig <ref> [3] </ref> proposed to abstract packet streams (Flowsim) for packet network simulations and proved that Flowsim can be adjusted to the desired simulation granularity and help to study flow and congestion control algorithms more efficiently. However, Flowsim only abstracts one aspect of network simulation.

Reference-contexts: However, Flowsim only abstracts one aspect of network simulation. We present two other techniques for a wider range of network protocols. In hybrid simulation models <ref> [4] </ref>, both discrete-event simulation and analytic techniques are combined to produce efficient yet accurate system models. There are examples of using hybrid simulations on hypothetical computer systems.

Reference-contexts: Current Internet multicast protocols transfer information along distribution trees rooted at the group sources and spanning the group members. Various multicast routing protocols establish these multicast trees in different ways: broadcast and prune (e.g., DVMRP <ref> [5] </ref> and PIM-DM [6]), membership advertisement (e.g., MOSPF [9]), and rendezvous-based (e.g., CBT [7] and PIM-SM [8]). Much of the current IP multicast infrastructure uses broadcast and prune protocols, so we use a DVMRP-like implementation as the standard detailed multicast for the comparison.

Reference-contexts: Three sets of tests explore each of the three dimensions from a standard case, 300 nodes (average degree 1.77), 30 groups, and 30 members. We use 2-level hierarchical network topologies with a constant degree of connectivity (~1.77), created by GT-ITM (Georgia Tech - Internetwork Topology Model) <ref> [10] </ref>. Sources and members are randomly chosen for all simulations. Memory and running time are measured to compare the performance among the three versions of simulations.

Reference-contexts: However, modeling is often intractable with todays large networks and complex traffic patterns, so researchers have turned increasingly to simulation. In order to evaluate wide-area protocols with thousands of nodes, we must be able to perform large-scale simulations. General-purpose network simulators (such as ns-2 <ref> [11] </ref>) make simulation easier by capturing characteristics of real network components and providing a modular programming environment, often composed by links, nodes and existing protocol suites. For instance, a link may contain transmission and propagation delay modules, and a node may contain routing tables, forwarding machinery, and local agents.

Reference-contexts: It is important that users follow the general guidelines to create efficient and accurate abstract, large-scale simulations. To demonstrate, we examine the use of the general guidelines on an important, active research area, reliable multicast. In particular, we choose Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) <ref> [12] </ref>, one of the pioneer research in reliable multicast. 5.1. SRM Mechanism To appear, International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS), Montreal, Canada, July 1998 7 SRM (Scalable Reliable Multicast) [26] is a reliable multicast transport protocol.
