Abstract: Video delivery from a server to a client across a network is an important component of many multimedia applications. While delivering a video stream across a resource constrained network, loss of frames may be unavoidable. Under such circumstances, it is desirable to find a server transmission schedule that can efficiently utilize the network resources while maximizing the perceived quality-of-service (QoS) at the client. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce the notion of selective frame discard at the server and formulate the optimal selective frame discard problem using a QoS-based cost function. Given network bandwidth and client buffer constraints, we develop an O(N log N ) algorithm to find the minimum number of frames that must be discarded in order to meet these constraints. The correctness of the algorithm is also formally established. We present a dynamic programming based algorithm for solving the problem of optimal selective frame discard. Since the computational complexity of the optimal algorithm is prohibitively high in general, we also develop several efficient heuristic algorithms for selective frame discard. These algorithms are evaluated using JPEG and MPEG video traces.

Evaluation of server selective frame discard algorithms based on the actual QoS perceived by clients will then be carried out.

Reference-contexts: Video smoothing techniques [20, 24, 5, 25, 12, 15, 9, 14] have been proposed for reducing the network bandwidth requirement of bursty video streams by taking advantage of client buffering capabilities. Similar techniques have also been developed when network bandwidth is constrained instead of the client buffer <ref> [3, 16, 19, 21] </ref>. In reality, however, both network bandwidth and client buffering capacity are likely to be limited. Under such circumstances, there may not be a feasible server transmission schedule that can deliver video streams to clients without incurring loss of data. <p> We present the results for three representative traces, Sleepless in Seattle, Beauty and the Beast and Jurassic Park. Table 3 lists the characteristics of these traces <ref> [3] </ref>, where among other things, the average rate, the peak rate of the video traces are shown. Also included is the peak rate of the optimal smoothed schedule [20] using a client buffer size of 1 MB and zero startup delay.

Reference-contexts: This may arise, for example, in the case of constant-bit-rate (CBR) service, where for a client with a limited buffer, the network may not have sufficient bandwidth to support the peak rate of a smoothed video stream, or in the case of renegotiated CBR (RCBR) service <ref> [7] </ref>, where bandwidth renegotiation fails in the middle of a video transmission. When delivering a video stream across a resource-constrained network, a naive approach at the server may attempt to transmit each frame with no awareness of the resource constraints.
