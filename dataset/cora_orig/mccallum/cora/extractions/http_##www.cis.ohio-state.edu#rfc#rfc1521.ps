Title: Network Working Group N. Borenstein Request for Comments: 1521 Bellcore MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
Author: Obsoletes: N. Freed 
Date: September 1993  
Note: Category: Standards Track  this memo is unlimited. This document does NOT extend Internet mail header fields to permit anything other than US-ASCII text data. Such extensions are the subject of a companion document [RFC -1522]. This document is a revision of RFC 1341. Significant differences from RFC 1341 are summarized in Appendix H. Borenstein Freed [Page i]  
Abstract: STD 11, RFC 822 defines a message representation protocol which specifies considerable detail about message headers, but which leaves the message content, or message body, as flat ASCII text. This document redefines the format of message bodies to allow multipart textual and non-textual message bodies to be represented and exchanged without loss of information. This is based on earlier work documented in RFC 934, STD 11, and RFC 1049, but extends and revises that work. Because RFC 822 said so little about message bodies, this document is largely orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) RFC 822. In particular, this document is designed to provide facilities to include multiple objects in a single message, to represent body text in character sets other than US-ASCII, to represent formatted multi-font text messages, to represent non-textual material such as images and audio fragments, and generally to facilitate later extensions defining new types of Internet mail for use by cooperating mail agents.

Reference-contexts: National use variations of ISO 646 [ISO-646] are NOT ASCII and their use in Internet mail is explicitly discouraged. The omission of the ISO 646 character set is deliberate in this regard. The character set name of "US-ASCII" explicitly refers to ANSI X3.4-1986 <ref> [US-ASCII] </ref> only. The character set name "ASCII" is reserved and must not be used for any purpose. NOTE: RFC 821 explicitly specifies "ASCII", and references an earlier version of the American Standard. <p> The complete US-ASCII character set is listed in <ref> [US-ASCII] </ref>. Note that the control characters including DEL (0-31, 127) have no defined meaning apart from the combination CRLF (ASCII values 13 and 10) indicating a new line. <p> For this reason, we define names for a small number of character sets for which a strong constituent base exists. The defined charset values are: US-ASCII -- as defined in <ref> [US-ASCII] </ref>. ISO-8859-X -- where "X" is to be replaced, as necessary, for the parts of ISO-8859 [ISO-8859]. Note that the ISO 646 character sets have deliberately been omitted in favor of their 8859 replacements, which are the designated character sets for Internet mail.

Reference-contexts: The term "video" is used extremely generically, rather than with reference to any particular technology or format, and is not meant to preclude subtypes such as animated drawings encoded compactly. The subtype "mpeg" refers to video coded according to the MPEG standard <ref> [MPEG] </ref>. Note that although in general this document strongly discourages the mixing of multiple media in a single body, it is recognized that many so-called "video" formats include a representation for synchronized audio, and this is explicitly permitted for subtypes of "video".

For these access-types, the following additional parameters are mandatory: NAME -- The name of the file that contains the actual body data. SITE -- A machine from which the file may be obtained, using the given protocol. <p> MODE -- A case-insensitive string indicating the mode to be used when retrieving the information. The legal values for access-type "TFTP" are "NETASCII", "OCTET", and "MAIL", as specified by the TFTP protocol <ref> [RFC-783] </ref>. The legal values for access-type "FTP" are "ASCII", "EBCDIC", "IMAGE", and "LOCALn" where "n" is a decimal integer, typically 8. These correspond to the representation types "A" "E" "I" and "L n" as specified by the FTP protocol [RFC-959].

Reference-contexts: in environments that support binary or 8-bit transport, the use of a content-transfer-encoding of "8bit" or "binary" is explicitly prohibited for entities of type message/external-body. 7.3.3.1 The "ftp" and "tftp" access-types An access-type of FTP or TFTP indicates that the message body is accessible as a file using the FTP <ref> [RFC-959] </ref> or TFTP [RFC-783] protocols, respectively. For these access-types, the following additional parameters are mandatory: NAME -- The name of the file that contains the actual body data.

Note that "BINARY" and "TENEX" are not valid values for MODE, but that "OCTET" or "IMAGE" or "LOCAL8" should be used instead.

Reference-contexts: Such formatted textual data should be represented using subtypes of text. Plausible subtypes of text are typically given by the common name of the representation format, e.g., "text/richtext" <ref> [RFC-1341] </ref>. 7.1.1 The charset parameter A critical parameter that may be specified in the Content-Type field for text/plain data is the character set. This is specified with a "charset" parameter, as in: Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii Unlike some other parameter values, the values of the charset parameter are NOT case sensitive. <p> This is useful for enclosing a bit-stream in a body when the total number of bits is not a multiple of the byte size. An additional parameter, "conversions", was defined in <ref> [RFC-1341] </ref> but has been removed. RFC 1341 also defined the use of a "NAME" parameter which gave a suggested file name to be used if the data were to be written to a file.

Reference-contexts: However, clear labeling will be of enormous value to gateways between future mail transport systems with differing capabilities in transporting data that do not meet the restrictions of RFC 821 transport. Mail transport for unencoded 8-bit data is defined in RFC-1426 <ref> [RFC-1426] </ref>. As of the publication of this document, there are no standardized Internet mail transports for which it is legitimate to include unencoded binary data in mail bodies. Thus there are no circumstances in which the "binary" Content-Transfer-Encoding is actually legal on the Internet.

Reference-contexts: example, it may be useful to mark an "image" body as "a picture of the Space Shuttle Endeavor." Such text may be placed in the Content-Description header field. description := "Content-Description" ":" *text The description is presumed to be given in the US-ASCII character set, although the mechanism specified in <ref> [RFC-1522] </ref> may be used for non-US-ASCII Content-Description values. Borenstein & Freed [Page 19] RFC 1521 MIME September 1993 7 The Predefined Content-Type Values This document defines seven initial Content-Type values and an extension mechanism for private or experimental types. Further standard types must be defined by new published specifications. <p> The multipart delimiters and header fields are always represented as 7-bit ASCII in any case (though the header fields may encode non-ASCII header text as per <ref> [RFC-1522] </ref>), and data within the body parts can be encoded on a part-by-part basis, with Content-Transfer-Encoding fields for each appropriate body part. Mail gateways, relays, and other mail handling agents are commonly known to alter the top-level header of an RFC 822 message. <p> Non-ASCII text in the headers of an encapsulated message can be specified using the mechanisms described in <ref> [RFC-1522] </ref>. Mail gateways, relays, and other mail handling agents are commonly known to alter the top-level header of an RFC 822 message. In particular, they frequently add, remove, or reorder header fields.
