Abstract: WebGUIDE is a system for exploring changes to World Wide Web pages and Web structure that supports recursive document comparison: users may explore the differences between pages with respect to two dates. Differences between pages are computed automatically and summarized in a new HTML page, and differences in link structure are shown via graphical representations. WebGUIDE is the combination of two tools that complement one another: the AT&T Internet Difference Engine (AIDE) [9] is a tool for tracking and viewing modifications to World-Wide-Web pages, which has been extended to support recursive tracking of pages; Ciao [6] is a graphical navigator that allows users to query and browse structural connections embedded in a document repository. The union of these tools let users get information on the evolution of pages of interest (both textually and graphically), browse the differences interactively, and dynamically modify the set of pages with which they interact.
