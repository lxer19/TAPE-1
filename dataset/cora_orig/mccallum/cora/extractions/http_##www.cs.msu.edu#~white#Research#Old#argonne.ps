Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Coloured Petri Nets are gaining popularity for modeling and analysis of many varied projects such as verification of hardware <ref> [1] </ref>, complexity reduction of systems [2], and formal descriptions of systems [3]. Their strong mathematical foundation allows complex analyses to be performed, and the recent development of CPN computer tools has provided the ability to simulate the net itself.

Coloured Petri Nets possess an inherent ability to model concurrency and conflict, properties ubiquitous in complex systems.

Reference-contexts: Coloured Petri Nets possess an inherent ability to model concurrency and conflict, properties ubiquitous in complex systems. There exist computer tools for generating, testing, and simulating Coloured Petri Nets, such as the tool that we will use, Design/CPN fl Advisor: Dr. Anthony Wojcik <ref> [4] </ref>. Design/CPN was chosen because it was developed for the University of Aarhus, where CPNs originated, and is freely available via ftp. These tools allow and fully support the hierarchical specification of CPNs, a property that we intend to take advantage of in this research.

Reference-contexts: The analysis methods that are applicable to Coloured Petri Nets are: construction of occurrence graphs, calculation and interpretation of system invariants, reductions, and checking of structural properties <ref> [5] </ref>. All of these techniques may prove useful to the field of re-engineering; at this time we will focus on reductions as a method of reaching a higher level of abstraction in the design, allowing greater understanding of the functionality of the digital system.

Reference-contexts: For this methodology, it is necessary to have a text representation of the nets. To this end, I have developed my own, which is under constant revision and growth. 2. Convert VHDL to CPN textual representation: Several papers have addressed the problem of converting VHDL to CPN descriptions ([6], <ref> [7] </ref>), and many conclusions have been presented; these will be used to create the automated transformation methodology. A preliminary study is available [8]. 3. Perform transformations on CPN text: Many papers have been presented that address the issue of reduction of Coloured Petri Nets ([2], [9]).
