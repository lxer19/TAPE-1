Title: A Domain Theory for Task Oriented Negotiation

Abstract: We present a general theory that captures the relationship between certain domains and negotiation mechanisms. The analysis makes it possible to categorize precisely the kinds of domains in which agents find themselves, and to use the category to choose appropriate negotiation mechanisms. The theory presented here both generalizes previous results, and allows agent designers to characterize new domains accurately. The analysis thus serves as a critical step in using the theory of negotiation in real-world applications. We show that in certain Task Oriented Domains, there exist distributed consensus mechanisms with simple and stable strategies that lead to efficient outcomes, even when agents have incomplete information about their environment. We also present additional novel results, in particular that in concave domains using all-or-nothing deals, no lying by an agent can be beneficial, and that in subadditive domains, there often exist beneficial decoy lies that do not require full information regarding the other agent's goals.

Reference-contexts: Definition 13 An optimal negotiation mechanism over a set of deals is a mechanism that has a negotiation strategy that is in equilibrium with itself|if all agents use this negotiation strategy, they will agree on a deal in NS that maximizes the product of the agents' utility <ref> [ Nash, 1950 ] </ref> . If there is more than one such deal that maximizes the product, the mechanism chooses one arbitrarily, with equal probability. An optimal negotiation mechanism by definition satisfies the stability and efficiency criteria mentioned in Section 1.1.

Reference-contexts: The protocol defined above in Section 1 has an equilibrium strategy for each deal type that yields agreement on a deal in NS that maximizes the product of the agents' utility. Those strategies are based on Zeuthen risk criteria <ref> [ Zeuthen, 1930 ] </ref> , and were presented in [ Zlotkin and Rosenschein, 1989 ] . Therefore, the above protocol is an example of an optimal negotiation mechanism.

Reference-contexts: The examination of this relationship between the negotiation mechanism and the domain made use of two prototypical examples: the Postmen Domain (introduced in <ref> [ Zlotkin and Rosenschein, 1989 ] </ref> ), and the Slotted Blocks World (presented in [ Zlotkin and Rosen-schein, 1991a ] ). It was clear that these two domains exemplified general classes of multi-agent interactions (e.g., the Postmen Domain was inherently cooperative, the Slotted Blocks World not). <p> In this paper, we show that such mechanisms exist for certain domains. 2 Task Oriented Domains A Task Oriented Domain (TOD) describes a certain class of scenarios for multi-agent encounters. In particular, the Postmen Domain <ref> [ Zlotkin and Rosenschein, 1989 ] </ref> is an instance of a TOD (the Slotted Blocks World from [ Zlotkin and Rosenschein, 1991a ] , however, is not a TOD). Intuitively, it is a domain that is cooperative, with no negative interactions among agents' goals. <p> The protocol defined above in Section 1 has an equilibrium strategy for each deal type that yields agreement on a deal in NS that maximizes the product of the agents' utility. Those strategies are based on Zeuthen risk criteria [ Zeuthen, 1930 ] , and were presented in <ref> [ Zlotkin and Rosenschein, 1989 ] </ref> . Therefore, the above protocol is an example of an optimal negotiation mechanism. <p> A negotiation mechanism is called incentive compatible when the strategy of telling the truth (or behaving according to your true goals) is in equilibrium (i.e., when one agent uses the strategy, the best thing the other agent can do is use the same strategy). In the Postmen Domain <ref> [ Zlotkin and Rosenschein, 1989 ] </ref> , we identified three types of lies: 1. Hiding tasks (e.g., a letter is hidden); 2. Phantom tasks (e.g., the agent claims to have a letter, which is non-existent and cannot be produced by the lying agent); 3. <p> Additionally, in a subadditive domain where decoy tasks cannot be generated, an optimal negotiation procedure over all-or-nothing deals with a penalty mechanism for discovered lies is incentive compatible (this was shown, in a different form, in <ref> [ Zlotkin and Rosenschein, 1989 ] </ref> ). This can be seen in the table, where the all-or-nothing row is marked with T and T/P (excluding the decoy column).

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1 All concave TOD's are also subadditive. Proof. The proof of this theorem and all other theorems can be found in <ref> [ Zlotkin and Rosenschein, 1992 ] </ref> . The general Postmen Domain is not concave. The other TOD examples (the Fax Domain and the Database Query Domain) are concave. Theorem 2 The Postmen Domain, restricted to graphs that have a tree topology (no cycles), is concave.
