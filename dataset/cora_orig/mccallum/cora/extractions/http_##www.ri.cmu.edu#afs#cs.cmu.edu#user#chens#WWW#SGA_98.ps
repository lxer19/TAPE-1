Abstract: Traditionally, crossover operators are based on combination--an operator takes parts from two parents and combines them into an offspring. This paper presents a series of crossover operators based on commonality--an operator preserves the common parts from two parents and uses them as a base on which an offspring solution is built. Experiments on benchmark sequencing problems show that these new commonality-based operators perform better than previously developed combination-based operators. One new operator, Maximum Partial Order/Arbitrary Insertion, is capable of finding new best-known solutions for the Sequential Ordering Problem. Overall, the results support a new commonality-based framework for designing crossover operators.

Reference-contexts: Further, the resulting offspring solutions from these operators can be (locally) optimized before adding them to the population--the crossover-local optimization method pairing can be viewed as a hybrid operator. 3.1 Domain Independent Operators for the Travelling Salesman Problem An early domain independent operator for the TSP is Order Crossover (OX) <ref> [Dav85] </ref>. It has the form of two-point crossover. Between the cut points, OX takes a sub-tour of elements from Parent 2. Then, starting from the second cut point, OX takes the elements of Parent 1.

Returning the focus to commonality, some common edges can be disrupted by 2-Opt. (See Figure 4.) However, over 90% of the common (CST) edges from the parents are kept after 2-Opt during the

Reference-contexts: Essentially, this weakness of the transmission design principle makes it a poor heuristic for domain dependent operators. Conversely, without being restricted by transmission, CST/NN (like uniform crossover) can explore a larger solution set. 3.3 Order-Based Heuristic Operators for the Travelling Salesman Problem The Matrix Intersection operator (MI) <ref> [FM91] </ref> represents a sequence with a Boolean matrix. The matrix is n x n, and element (i,j) is 1 if element j follows element i in the sequence, and it is 0 otherwise. A matrix represents a feasible solution if three constraints are satisfied.

Reference-contexts: For the TSP, this results in Greedy Crossover (GX) <ref> [GGR85] </ref>. It creates an offspring by combining short edges taken from the parents. The most common edge is lost during 2-Opt. effective version of GX starts with a random element and builds the tour by picking the shortest edge from either parent that does not introduce a cycle.

Reference-contexts: Crossover distributes the parts of each parent over two offspring. This makes it unlikely that either offspring receives long schemata directly from a single parent. Thus, it is suggested that the critical building blocks manipulated by crossover are short, low-order, above-average schemata <ref> [Gol89] </ref>. The power of crossover then comes from its ability to preserve and recombine these building blocks when assembling new solutions. Examining the effect of standard crossover operators from the viewpoint of both parents, it can be seen that schemata common to both parents are unconditionally propagated to offspring solutions.

Reference-contexts: Results indicate that MPO/AI outperforms both MI/AI and Dec/Rec. (See Table 3.) 3.4 Hybrid Operators for the Travelling Salesman Problem Recognizing that GX solutions often have crossing edges that 2-Opt can correct, the GX-2-Opt hybrid operator was developed <ref> [JSG89] </ref>. Similarly, 2-Opt can be added to CST/ NN to make the CST/NN-2-Opt hybrid operator. Further, for edge representations, 2-Opt is the Binomial Minimal Mutation (BMM) [RS94].

Reference-contexts: However, many important problems require non-standard representations (e.g. sequences). The crossover operators designed for these problems have not always preserved commonality--the focus of design has been on combination. Combination and commonality receive equal treatment in Radcliffes three design principles: respect, transmission, and assortment <ref> [Rad91] </ref>. Respect is equivalent to commonality-- two parents that have a schema H in common should produce an offspring that also has schema H. Transmission is similar to non-disruptive--schemata in the offspring should come from one of the parents. <p> Similarly, 2-Opt can be added to CST/ NN to make the CST/NN-2-Opt hybrid operator.

The MPO constitutes a notion of shape. While good TSP tours appear smooth, poor TSP tours appear jagged.

Reference-contexts: Experimental results have shown that uniform crossover outperforms two-point crossover, which itself outperforms one-point crossover <ref> [Sys89] </ref>. If the maximal common schema has n wildcard slots (*), one-point crossover explores a set with 2n possible offspring, two-point crossover can explore n 2 -n possible offspring, and uniform crossover can explore 2 n possible offspring. <p> Combination (assortment) has been viewed as the means to do both.

Reference-contexts: This underconstrained matrix can be completed by using the Arbitrary Insertion 1 (AI) construction heuristic (modified for MI 2 ). The resulting heuristic operator is Matrix Intersection/Arbitrary Insertion (MI/AI). Similar in form to a commonality-based crossover operator, a deconstruction/reconstruction (Dec/Rec) procedure has been used by an A-team <ref> [TS92] </ref>. The deconstruction step creates a sub-tour by connecting the common edges of two parents in the order and orientation of Parent 1. (See Figure 5.) The reconstruction step uses AI to complete the sub-tour.
