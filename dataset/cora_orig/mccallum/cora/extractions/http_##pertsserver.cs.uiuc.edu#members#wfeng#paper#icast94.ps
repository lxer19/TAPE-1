Abstract: To provide a natural interface to the computer, we have developed an integrated speech, gesture, and handwriting recognition system. By integrating the technologies, we can easily accomplish, most, if not all, of the tasks that are needed to use computers and their applications, including many tasks which neither technology can adequately perform by itself. This integrated environment not only makes it easier for novices to use computers, but also increases the productivity of experienced computer users.

Reference-contexts: So instead, we use pen-based handwriting and gesture recognizers (in conjunction with the speech recognizer) to easily accomplish most, if not all, of the tasks necessary to use computer applications. Our real-time handwriting and gesture recognition systems recognize writing as it is being written <ref> [2, 5] </ref>. To be able to recognize the writing in real-time, the system captures temporal information as the user writes.

With handwriting recognition, the recognition of written ASCII characters depends on shape consistency (i.e., the difference between the same symbol produced at different times is less than the difference between different symbols).

Next, the pre-processor ensures segmentation | the isolation of characters or words from each other | and performs noise-reduction operations such as smoothing, filtering, wild-point correction, dehooking, and dot reduction <ref> [5] </ref>. Then, the recognizer performs shape recognition to determine the printable ASCII character that was written. The shape-recognition phase entails an analysis of the time sequence of directions of the stylus as well as curve matching.

Reference-contexts: Figure 4 shows examples of these variations with the delete symbol. Gesture Alphabet Unlike handwriting, there is no fixed set of gestures defined and used by the general population. Based on a paper-and-pencil study of gestures <ref> [6] </ref>, a representative set of gestures for an initial gesture alphabet is shown in Figure 5. Gesture Commands Without any context, a gesture by itself does not have any meaning. For example, the word the.
