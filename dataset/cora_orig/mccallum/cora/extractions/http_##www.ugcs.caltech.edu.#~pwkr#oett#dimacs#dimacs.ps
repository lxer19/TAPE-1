Abstract: Bacteria employ restriction enzymes to cut or restrict DNA at or near specific words in a unique way. Many restriction enzymes cut the two strands of double-stranded DNA at different positions leaving overhangs of single-stranded DNA. Two pieces of DNA may be rejoined or ligated if their terminal overhangs are complementary. Using these operations fragments of DNA, or oligonucleotides, may be inserted and deleted from a circular piece of plasmid DNA. We propose an encoding for the transition table of a Turing machine in DNA oligonucleotides and a corresponding series of restrictions and ligations of those oligonu-cleotides that, when performed on circular DNA encoding an instantaneous description of a Turing machine, simulate the operation of the Turing machine encoded in those oligonucleotides. DNA based Turing machines have been proposed by Charles Bennett but they invoke imaginary enzymes to perform the state-symbol transitions. Our approach differs in that every operation can be performed using commercially available restriction enzymes and ligases.

Reference-contexts: Minsky's machine takes an amount of time exponential on the size of the tape of the machine it is simulating to get from one ID of that machine to another. St-al Aanderaa <ref> [Aa] </ref> calculates that his "fairly small" 10 x 6 UTM 32 requires 20,000 steps to advance the simulation of a 2 x 2 Turing by one ID when the simulated machine's tape holds only 6 symbols! Machines that use unary representations of other machines, it seems, are doomed to be slow.

Reference-contexts: To many, the chemistry of life with its myriad of enzymes and informationally rich nucleic acids seemed a good candidate|and it has provided us with our first success. Last year, Leonard Adleman used the chemistry of DNA to solve the directed Hamiltonian path problem <ref> [Ad1] </ref>. This was a very important first step towards realizing molecular computation|similar combinatorial approaches may prove to be the best way to solve NP complete problems. Such an approach does not, however, give us a programmable molecular computer that can solve any problem for which we can write a algorithm. <p> Nevertheless, DNA memory models have a real advantage over paper pushing computers and, perhaps, electronic ones|they allow us to push around 10 14 little pieces of DNA paper at once! (In <ref> [Ad1] </ref> 4 x 10 14 DNA molecules are used to represent edges in a graph.) 2 Indefinitely, in this context, means that if ever our Turing machine runs out of tape we append a few more cells. 2 machine and consider only the non-halting states.

Reference-contexts: Models like these that detail how a computation would proceed if we had certain chemicals at our disposal probably must await breakthroughs in protein engineering to be implemented. Extensions of Adleman's approach (<ref> [Ad2] </ref>, [Bon]) can implement universal models of computation. Adleman [Ad2] presents a series of operation on "DNA test tubes" that simulate a memory model of computation. Boneh et al. give a method for simulating nondeterministic boolean circuits.

Reference-contexts: Numerous workers have proposed such translations using theoretical chemistries. Charles Bennett first likened the operation of RNA polymerase to a Turing machine in 1973 <ref> [Ben1] </ref>. In 1982 [Ben2] he gave a schematic description of a DNA Turing machine using imaginary enzymes capable of recognizing and changing single bases of DNA. Others have since proposed the construction of chemical computers using different sets of hypothetical chemical species and different models of computation. <p> The similarity has prompted others to think of it as a media for computation ([Ad1], <ref> [Ben1] </ref>). As such DNA has several attractive qualities: (A) DNA is the genetic material. DNA is the storage medium for genes|the plans for the protein molecular machines that perform most of the chemistry in all living things. Our genes determine our morphology, and influence our behaviour.

Reference-contexts: For similar reasons shorter DNA tapes (as long as they are not too short and stiff) will also cyclize better than longer floppier DNA tapes <ref> [Cr] </ref>.
