Abstract: We present an implementation of an electronic auction house inspired by the age old institution of the fish market, where both software and human agents may trade. This implementation supports fair, lively and robust bidder interactions. FM96.5 is a Java-based multi-agent environment that allows for a real-time concurrent operation of the complete fish market auction process by making use of multi-threading. Agent interactions in this structured environment are modelled through standardized illocutions implemented upon Java Object Serialization.

Reference-contexts: To understand our current implementation of the bidding protocol, it may prove helpful to regard downward bidding rounds as competitions for a unique resource (the good being auctioned). This turns out to be similar to the problem of distributed mutual exclusion ( <ref> [3] </ref>) with a slight difference: distributed mutual exclusion involves a single process being given the right to access shared resources temporarily before another is granted it, whereas a bidding round involves a single process being given the right to acquire resources that will not be shared with the rest of the

In <ref> [5] </ref> we presented a prototype implementation of a simple version of the fish market. FM96.5 is a far more thorough implementation. In between we have addressed different aspects of the problem, and gone through the exercise of exploring specific technical or methodological issues (as shown in Table 1).
