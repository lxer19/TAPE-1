A good overview of these applications is given in <ref> [1] </ref> Typical Present RF Transceiver Implementation The vast majority of currently-manufactured transceivers for the applications mentioned above utilize single or dual-conversion configuration for the receive path. Baseband channel bandwidths range from 10kHz to 1-2MHz.

Reference-contexts: The principal tradeoffs are the incurred penalty in power dissipation and die area of the digital implementation, and the cost and die area of the required A/D converter. Rapid progress has been made in the implementation of these types of functions in VLSI CMOS [38][37][39] <ref> [19] </ref>. Many benefits accrue in pushing baseband signal processing into the digital domain, particularly for multistandard adaptive transceivers.

Reference-contexts: Since this mixer will have to provide image rejection on the order of 60-70dB in some applications, phase shift accuracy and path matching accuracy within the mixer must be extremely precise. Progress has been made in this area in recent research <ref> [21] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Bipolar and BiCMOS solutions are attractive because of the inherent capability of bipolar transistors to provide high g m at low current, and because of the well-developed family of circuit techniques for RF design using bipolar technology <ref> [23] </ref>. There is also considerable interest in utilizing CMOS for high-integration transceivers, particularly within the university community.

Reference-contexts: Two approaches have been described in recent work for improving the performance of spiral inductors. In one approach, <ref> [25] </ref> a pit is etched under the spiral to remove the substrate capacitance and resulting self-resonance. The resulting structures have moderate Q but good self-resonance characteristics.

Reference-contexts: In effect, for a given power dissipation a ring oscillator has a phase noise approximately equivalent to an LC oscillator with a Q of unity <ref> [27] </ref>. Each factor of 10 reduc tion in phase noise power with respect to the carrier requires a factor of 10 increase in power dissipation, all else being equal.

Reference-contexts: Also, available on-chip spiral inductors in standard silicon technologies have Qs limited to 5-10 at the frequencies of interest, only adequate in some situations for implementation of the low-phase-noise VCO required in conventional synthesizer architectures. In the transmit direction, the use of direct carrier modulation has become widespread <ref> [29] </ref>, so that channel shaping f ilters can be implemented at baseband. In current practice the transmit power amplifier is usually implemented with GaAs discrete devices or simple ICs with a number of external inductors used for tuning and impedance matching. <p> Because of the limited Q available, the phase noise achievable is not as low as required in some applications. Other alternatives with higher Q include the use of bond wire inductance [24][52]and the use of plated-up gold inductors over thick oxide <ref> [29] </ref>. Even with higher-Q inductors, the realization of a low-resistance, wide-range varactor tuning capacitance using standard IC technology is difficult. The simultaneous realization of high Q and tunability, together with either wide tuning range or high center frequency accuracy, is a very dif ficult task. <p> It appears that this will be a very effective solution for at least the subset of applications where modest phase noise and modest spurious output component requirements can be tolerated. A similar approach using a secondary PLL to generate the of fset frequency has recently been proposed <ref> [29] </ref>. Low-Power Baseband Signal Conversion and Processing Depending on the type of transceiver, baseband operations of IF filtering, equalization, timing recovery, symbol constellation decoding, signal correlation, symbol generation, quadrature modulation, frequency synthesis and so forth are required. <p> The resulting structures have moderate Q but good self-resonance characteristics. Another approach is the deposition of thick oxide following normal IC fabrication, and the deposition of highly conductive interconnect metallization such as gold to form a high-Q spiral with reasonable self-resonance behavior. <ref> [29] </ref> This approach has high promise because the subsequent processing is relatively non-invasive to the underlying silicon and involves only low-temperature deposition and masking steps. Package and Substrate Modeling Perhaps the greatest single barrier to higher integration in RF transceivers is undesired interactions through substrate and package coupling.

Reference-contexts: Finding techniques for reducing the power dissipation of these A/D converters is a key goal. Current state of the art for this class of converters is about 1mW/ MHz of sample rate at 10 bits <ref> [35] </ref>. Technologies for High-Integration RF Transceivers Current transceiver implementations usually use a mix of technologies, with GaAs for the power amplif ier and perhaps for the LNA, bipolar or BiCMOS for the mixer and IF functions, and CMOS for the baseband processing.

Reference-contexts: The continued scaling of CMOS technology, with 0.1 micron devices with f t s of near 100GHz recently demonstrated,[42][43] should eventually allow this approach. Silicon-germanium technologies now evolving have the potential to provide bipolar devices with substantially larger f t and f max than the best current bipolar technologies <ref> [44] </ref>. The impact of this development is likely to be felt mostly at the high end of the frequency spectrum under discussion here. Compatible High-Q Inductors and Resonators in Silicon For reasons explained earlier, on-chip inductors are essential to low-power RF design.

Reference-contexts: A number of approaches show promise for realizing the VCO function on-chip. These include the use of on-chip spiral inductors <ref> [46] </ref>, and the use of synthesizer conf igurations that allow wide PLL bandwidth so that the phase noise of the VCO is suppressed in the range of interest [27][28].

Reference-contexts: The use of complex signal representation at IF, as in image reject mixers, can improve image rejection by a considerable mar gin <ref> [47] </ref> and simplify the passive RF image reject f ilter, but the difficulty of phase and amplitude matching at IF usually limits the image rejection in such mixers to values on the order of 20dB, and as a result the IF frequencies must still be kept fairly high to preserve image

Reference-contexts: A promising approach to achieving this is to use techniques of VCO phase interpolation in order to be able to make more frequent comparison of VCO phase with the instantaneous phase of the crystal reference. Discrete phase interpolation and noiseshaping M/N interpolation <ref> [49] </ref> are two examples of approaches to this goal.
