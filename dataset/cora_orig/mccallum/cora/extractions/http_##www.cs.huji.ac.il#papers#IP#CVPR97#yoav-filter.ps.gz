Abstract: The Kalman filter is a very efficient optimal filter, however, it has the precondition that the noises of the process and of the measurement are Gaussian. In this paper we introduce 'The General Distribution Filter' which is an optimal filter that can be used even where the distributions are not Gaussian. An efficient practical implementation of the filter is possible where the distributions are discrete and compact or can be approximated as such.

Reference-contexts: We call this chosen value 'the working point'. There are several options to define what is the 'best' working point for x t . Here we describe three methods for choosing the working point. The first two methods are commonly used in estimation theory <ref> [1] </ref>, while the third is new.

Reference-contexts: The object is tracked by tracking the mean motion of the n points. A complete description of the tracking system can be found in <ref> [4] </ref> and [5], we show here only the outline. The first stage in the tracking system is to find the displacement of a single point. It can be shown that the point's displacement can be found confidentially only when the point is a sharp corner. <p> A better choice for the working point is x opt . The optimization criteria used is, that the point moves as close as possible to the object's mean motion. More details and experimental results can be found in <ref> [4] </ref> and [5]. 4. Summary We have introduced the general distribution filter as an alternative to the Kalman filter in cases where the measurement's distribution cannot be approximated by a Gaussian.
