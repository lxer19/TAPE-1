Abstract: We study equations of the form (ff = x) which are single axioms for groups of exponent 4, where ff is a term in product only. Every such ff must have at least 9 variable occurrences, and there are exactly three such ff of this size, up to variable renaming and mirroring. These terms were found by an exhaustive search through all terms of this form. Automated techniques were used in two ways: to eliminate many ff by verifying that (ff = x) true in some non-group, and to verify that the group axioms do indeed follow from the successful (ff = x). We also present an improvement on Neumann's scheme for single axioms for varieties of groups. x0. Introduction. If n 1 is an integer, a group of exponent n is a group in which x n is the identity for all elements x. We study equations of the form (ff = x) which are single axioms for groups of exponent n, where ff is a term in product only. Note that in our definition of "exponent n", we do not require that n is the smallest exponent, so, for example, every group of exponent 2 is also a group of exponent 4. The class of groups of exponent "precisely 4" (that is, also satisfying 9y(y 2 6= e)) cannot be axiomatized by any set of equations. First, some notation on terms. We shall use the binary function symbol t to denote the group product. We shall also sometimes use standard infix algebraic notation as an abbreviation, with products associating to the right. Thus, for example, x y z and xyz both abbreviate the term t(x; t(y; z)). We use exponentiation as a further abbreviation, with x 1 abbreviating x and x n+1 abbreviating x x n . Let RA(ff) result from associating all products in ff to the right; thus, for example RA(t(t(x; y); t(z; u))) is t(x; t(y; t(z; u))), which is the same as xyzu by our conventions on algebraic notation. Because of the finite exponent, we can express all the group axioms in terms of product only. Thus, we say, a group of exponent n is a model for the following set of three axioms:

Reference-contexts: Let c n be the number of ways to associate a product of n factors. So, for example, c 4 = 5, since wxyz can be associated in the 5 ways: w ((xy)z) w (x (yz)) (wx)(yz) ((wx)y)z (w (xy))z These are the Catalan numbers (see, e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>), and may be computed either by the closed form, c n = 1 n C (2n 2; n 1), or by the recurrence: c 1 = 1; c n = i=1 In particular, the value which is relevant here, c 9 , is 1430.

The proof in <ref> [3] </ref> shows how to build a model by adjoining one element to a Steiner triple system. <p> cannot be a single axiom for groups of exponent 4 because it is derivable from the set of all 2-variable equations valid in all Boolean groups. 3 One might eliminate candidates by checking their validity in a G satisfying Theorem 1.1; such a model, of size 10, is described in <ref> [3] </ref>. However, in practice, such a check would be rather slow. We found it quicker to use a purely syntactic approach. <p> This is explained at the end of x4. x4. The exponent 4 search. We prove Theorem 0.3 by searching through all associative variants of y 4 xz 4 . This search is similar in spirit to the ones described in <ref> [3] </ref>. We can figure out ahead of time how many terms to expect in such a search. Let c n be the number of ways to associate a product of n factors.

Reference-contexts: The single axioms from Neumann's scheme have V (ff) = n 4 2n 2 + n + 1 (see x5), which is quite a bit larger than this minimum. However, it is known that for n = 2 (Meredith Prior [8]) and for n odd (McCune - Wos <ref> [7] </ref>), there are single axioms with V (ff) = 2n + 1. The situation for even n &gt; 2 remained open. In this paper, we settle the question for n = 4 by showing that there are single axioms of minimal size (V (ff) = 9): 0.2 Theorem. <p> Then (ff = x) is a single group axiom iff (M (ff) = x) is. This mirror symmetry was also exploited by McCune and Wos <ref> [6, 7] </ref>; it cuts the search space in half. A renaming of an equation is an equation obtained by changing the names of some (possibly all, or possibly none) of the variables. <p> Suppose that (ff = x) is a single axiom for groups of exponent 4 and V (ff) = 9. Then some renaming of (ff = x) or of (M (ff) = x) is one of A0,A1,A2. In contrast, McCune and Wos <ref> [7] </ref> found 14 different single axioms of minimal size for exponent 5 groups, and we do not know if there are any more. <p> We may immediately cut the 1430 candidates in half, to 715, by using mirror symme try, as did McCune and Wos <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. Proof of Theorem 0.3. First, form a file consisting of all 1430 ff such that RA (ff) is y 4 xz 4 ; this can easily be done with the aid of OTTER.

Reference-contexts: In particular, then, V (ff) 2n + 1. The single axioms from Neumann's scheme have V (ff) = n 4 2n 2 + n + 1 (see x5), which is quite a bit larger than this minimum.

For n = 2, Theorem 0.1 (b) is false, since ((((y x) z) (y z)) = x) is a single axiom for Boolean groups, found by Meredith and Prior <ref> [8] </ref> (see p. 221; they use `E' for `'); others like this were found by McCune [6].

Reference-contexts: Neumann <ref> [9] </ref> proved that such ff exist. Actually, he found a general scheme for single axioms for any variety of groups, but the single axioms for exponent n groups produced as instances of this scheme are quite large, and it is natural to ask whether simpler ones exist. <p> This would have eliminated all representatives except A0. x5. Neumann's single axiom. If one is concerned just with the existence of single axioms, rather than their size, then Theorem 3 of Neumann <ref> [9] </ref> is much more general than the results presented here.
