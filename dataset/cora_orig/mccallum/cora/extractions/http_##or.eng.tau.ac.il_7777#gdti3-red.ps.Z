Reference-contexts: A complete implementation must follow as many guidelines in a consistent manner as possible. Some implementations discussed the creation of a schema for representing design knowledge about artifacts (e.g., <ref> (Kurumatani and Yoshikawa, 1987) </ref>) and some discussed the organization of concepts (e.g., (Taura et al, 1989)). Here we concentrate on another implementation that is far more developed than the others, and briefly mention implementations primarily relevant to the organization of concepts. Implementations directly related to GDT.

Reference-contexts: There are ways to construct a knowledge organization that is closer to a topology, for example, the creation of hierarchical classification of entities. Ecobweb is a program that provides support for incrementally creating hierarchical structures of entities <ref> (Reich and Fenves, 1992) </ref>. The classes in the hierarchical structure can be described by both intensional and extensional descriptions that can be used in synthesis. Ecobweb has several synthesis methods that can use the hierarchical structure and others can be easily incorporated due to the flexibility of the extensional representation.

Reference-contexts: This definition adds to Theorem 2 the restriction on a countable intersection of abstract concepts. This guarantees that the specification will be feasible (i.e., will contain candidate designs). Theorem 19: Any feasible specification in the real knowledge has a cluster point. This conclusion is equivalent to Hypothesis 1 <ref> (see Schubert, 1968, p. 69) </ref>. The set of candidate designs for a particular specification will be a set of entities that also contains a cluster point. The next theorem shows how a converging subsequence can be built that will arrive at a single solution.

Reference-contexts: Thus, property (3) deals with implementation issues that are important for CAD systems but less relevant to GDT as a theoretical entity. It is no surprise, therefore, that GDT axioms are built upon extensional representations of entities <ref> (Tomiyama and Yoshikawa, 1986) </ref>. The recognition of objects by abstract concepts described in Axioms 1 requires the use of extensional representations, and Axiom 3 and the progression of design process (i.e., by the intersection of abstract concepts) demand the use of extensional representations of abstract concepts.

Reference-contexts: In reality, design most often starts with a specification that is incomplete, contradictory, or infeasible. Significant part of design is invested in elaborating the specification through a design process that not only moves from the function to the attribute categorization but also progresses in the opposite direction <ref> (Tomiyama, 1994) </ref>. Thus, GDT predictions about design do not hold for real design processes. At this point we can simply terminate the study. GDT discusses an ideal design process that utilizes an ideal kind of knowledge. <p> While IDDL was developed as an infrastructure for CAD, its principles were use in the design of several innovative machines that embody intelligent control for self maintenance. A prototype of a self-maintained copier was patented <ref> (Tomiyama, 1994) </ref>. Implementations not-directly related to GDT. Taura et al. (1989) discussed the creation of a classification over a set of design entities by defining a metric over the space of entities and using it for clustering.
