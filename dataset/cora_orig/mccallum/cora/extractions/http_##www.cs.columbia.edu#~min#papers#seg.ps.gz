Abstract: We present a new method for discovering a segmental discourse structure of a document while categorizing each segments function and importance. Segments are determined by a zerosum weighting scheme, used on occurrences of noun phrases and pronominal forms retrieved from the document. Segment roles are then calculated from the distribution of the terms in the segment. Finally, we present results of evaluation in terms of precision and recall which surpass earlier approaches

Reference-contexts: For segmentation, applying machine learning techniques <ref> (Beeferman et al. 1997) </ref> to learn weights is a high priority. Moreover we feel shared resources for segmentation evaluation should be established 5 , to aid in a comprehensive cross-method study and to help alleviate the problems of significance of smallscale evaluations as discussed in Klavans et al (1998).

Reference-contexts: We have demonstrated a new algorithm that performs linear topical segmentation in an efficient manner that is based on linguistic principles. We achieve a 10% increase in accuracy and recall levels over prior work <ref> (Hearst 1994, 1997) </ref>. Our evaluation corpus exhibited a weak level of agreement among judges, which we believe correlates with the low level of performance of automatic segmentation programs as compared to earlier published works (Hearst 1997).

Our evaluation corpus exhibited a weak level of agreement among judges, which we believe correlates with the low level of performance of automatic segmentation programs as compared to earlier published works <ref> (Hearst 1997) </ref>. Additionally, we describe an original method to evaluate a segments significance: a two part metric that combines a measure of a segments generality based on statistical approaches, and a classification of a segments function based on empirical observations.

Reference-contexts: Each of the 20 articles in the corpus was segmented by at least four human judges, and the majority opinion of segment boundaries was computed as the evaluation standard <ref> (Klavans et al. 1998) </ref>. Human judges achieved on average only 62.4% agreement with the majority opinion, as seen in Table 2. <p> Segment Significance Evaluation As mentioned previously, segments and segment type assessments have been integrated into a key sentence extraction program <ref> (Klavans et al. 1998) </ref>. This summary-directed sentence extraction differs from similar systems in its focus on high recall; further processing of the retrieved sentences would discard unimportant sentences and clauses.

Reference-contexts: Singhal and Salton (1996) examined determining paragraph connectedness via vector space model similarity metrics, and this approach may extend well to the segment level. Considering the problem from another angle, discourse approaches have focused on shorter units than multi-paragraph segments, but Rhetorical Structure Theory <ref> (Marcu 1997 and others) </ref> may be able to scale up to associate rhetorical functions with segments.

Reference-contexts: For judging segment function, we plan to perform a direct assessment of the accuracy of segment classification. We want to expand and refine our definition of the types of segment function to include more distinctions, such as the difference between document/segment borders <ref> (Reynar 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Examining SEGMENTERs results show a significant improvement over the initial algorithm of Hearst 1994 (called TEXTTILING), both in precision and recall. A future step could be to compare our segmenting algorithm against other more recent systems <ref> (such as Yaari 1997, Okumura and Honda 1994) </ref>. We present two different baselines to compare the work against. First, we applied a Monte Carlo simulation that segments at paragraph breaks with a 33% probability. We executed this baseline 10,000 times on each article and averaged the scores.
