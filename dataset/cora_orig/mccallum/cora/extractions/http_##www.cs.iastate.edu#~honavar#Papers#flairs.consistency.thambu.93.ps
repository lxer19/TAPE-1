Reference-contexts: Note that the last four items in the list generally do not lead to inconsistencies but are identified nevertheless and the final decision is left to the domain expert. The consistency checker was developed in Awk <ref> (Aho et al., 1988) </ref> since it is a convenient tool for string manipulation and pattern matching. For each new rule output by the query system, the consistency checker is invoked.

Reference-contexts: Although the symbolic consistency system does not totally automate these decisions, it assists the domain expert in making such decisions, by helping the expert to focus his/her attention on the relevant parts of the knowledge base. 3 A Connectionist System for Consistency Maintenance Connectionist/expert system hybrids <ref> (Caudill, 1990) </ref> use a learning system to generate a knowledge base needed by an expert system using a training set of sample solutions (e.g., diagnoses). We use a connectionist learning system to train a knowledge based system to use new information with existing knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Input vectors of size N and a desired output for each of these vectors are presented to a backpropogation network <ref> (Rumelhart et al., 1986) </ref> to be trained. This trained connectionist system can then be used to solve problems in the domain. When new information comes in, it might either add some contraints or remove existing constraints.

Reference-contexts: Future research in this area will address the integration of knowledge acquisition with consistency maintenance using current machine learning techniques (e.g., knowledge- based artificial neural networks <ref> (Shavlik, 1993) </ref>).
