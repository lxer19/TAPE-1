Abstract: An essential component of opportunistic behavior is opportunity recognition, the recognition of those conditions that facilitate the pursuit of some suspended goal. Opportunity recognition is a special case of situation assessment, the process of sizing up a novel situation. The ability to recognize opportunities for reinstating suspended problem contexts (one way in which goals manifest themselves in design) is crucial to creative design. In order to deal with real world opportunity recognition, we attribute limited inferential power to relevant suspended goals. We propose that goals suspended in the working memory monitor the internal (hidden) representations of the currently recognized objects. A suspended goal is satisfied when the current internal representation and a suspended goal match. We propose a computational model for working memory and we compare it with other relevant theories of opportunistic planning. This working memory model is implemented as part of our IMPROVISER system.

Reference-contexts: Our computer program, IMPROVISER (Wills & Kolodner 1994b), was extended in order to help us answer the above questions. Our exploration of creative design <ref> (Kolodner & Wills 1993a) </ref> suggests that the conceptual phase, in which the problem is framed, plays a key role in designing. In this phase, which is interspersed throughout the design process, the problem situation is assessed and the given problem is reformulated and restructured.

Reference-contexts: It is not a particularly interesting device, and even though we see it every day, most of it is hidden by the roll of paper. Research shows that it is quite difficult to overcome such functional fixedness <ref> (Mayer 1970) </ref>, which associates everyday objects with their obvious function (holding a paper roll in the case of the toilet paper holder). Routinely, we ignore other potential uses that can be derived from the structure and behavior of such everyday objects.

Reference-contexts: But when we aren't making headway, we postpone additional retrieval until more information is gathered and pursue other retrieval strategies or subgoals <ref> (Williams & Hollan, 1981, Norman & Bobrow, 1979, Kolod-ner, 1984) </ref>. Similarly (and implied by predictive encoding), we suspend reasoning subgoals and subproblems that depend on postponed retrieval strategies and unmatched probes, marking them with criteria that, if encountered, predict that they should be reopened (Patalano, Seifert and Hammond 1992).
