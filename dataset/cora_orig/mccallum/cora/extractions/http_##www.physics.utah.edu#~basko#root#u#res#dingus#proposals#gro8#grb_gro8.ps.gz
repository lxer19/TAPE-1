Abstract: We request the equivalent of approximately one week of EGRET viewing time to study the highest energy emission from gamma-ray bursts. EGRET will turn on the spark chamber tracking detector for 10,000 seconds upon receipt of a BATSE generated trigger of a bright burst within 40 degrees of the EGRET axis This mode of operation has been used since Cycle 5 with a current average rate of one BATSE trigger every 17 days. All recent Comptel burst detections have been observed by EGRET with this trigger. For all bursts with spectra determined by Comptel, EGRET fluxes and upper limits show no evidence of any high energy cut off. The average spectrum measured by EGRET is as hard as measured by Comptel. Improved spectra and temporal evolution studies are planned with archival analysis of EGRET spark chamber events which do not pass gamma-ray cuts but are clearly associated with bursts. Scientific Importance High energy gamma rays strongly constraint the sources of gamma-ray bursts. Spectra extending up to GeV energies rules out thermal processes. Therefore, particles must be accelerated to energies even higher than the energy of these gamma rays. High energy gamma rays are observed almost simultaneously with the more plentiful lower energy gamma rays implying very rapid acceleration processes. Delayed high energy gamma rays are even more difficult to explain. Mezaros & Rees(1994) and Katz (1994) attribute the high energy, delayed emission to the collision between an expanding shell of debris and an external cloud of matter. The matter could be the expanding shell itself or ambient material. Plaga (1995) has proposed that delayed emission could be due to even higher energy photons pair producing with infrared photons. The electron is then deflected by intergalactic magnetic fields and inverse Compton scatters with a microwave photon to create a gamma ray which is delayed by the extra path length of the electron. eV is gamma-ray bursts. The UHECR produce GeV gamma-rays from photopion production with the cosmic microwave background while transiting to Earth (Waxman & Coppi, 1996) or the UHECR could create GeV synchronton emission when they crash into the interstellar medium (Vietri 1997). Different GeV fluence and time delays are expected from these two models. The recent paper of Bottcher & Dermer (1998) requires the afterglow of GeV gamma rays to decay slower than optical or xray afterglows. Since, in the bursts observed by EGRET, high energy gamma rays are not attenuated by pair production with the much more plentiful lower energy photons in the source, beaming and/or large bulk Lorentz factors are required. The Lorentz factors needed are much higher than observed from other astrophysical phenomena, such as the superluminal motion in active galactic nuclei with bulk Lorentz factors &lt; 10. The photon density in burst sources is especially large because of the small size of the source determined from the rapid time variability and the large distances to bursts. Bursts originating at cosmological distances require bulk Lorentz factors of order 1000. (Harding & Baring, 1997) The highest energy gamma-rays can also pair produce with ambient photons if they are produced at cosmological distances. Recent calculations of Salamon & Stecker (1998) indicate that ultraviolet photon densities would require the gamma-ray burst source to have z &lt; 2 if 20 GeV gamma-rays are observed as was the case for GRB940217. Observations of 100 GeV gamma-rays would imply the source to have z &lt; 0.5 which is starting to get close enough to constrain
