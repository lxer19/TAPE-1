Title: Domain Decomposition Methods for Monotone Nonlinear Elliptic Problems  
Author: XIAO-CHUAN CAI AND MAKSYMILIAN DRYJA 
Note: Contemporary Mathematics Volume 00, 0000  
Abstract: In this paper, we study several overlapping domain decomposition based iterative algorithms for the numerical solution of some nonlinear strongly elliptic equations discretized by the finite element methods. In particular, we consider additive Schwarz algorithms used together with the classical inexact Newton methods. We show that the algorithms converge and the convergence rates are independent of the finite element mesh parameter, as well as the number of subdomains used in the domain decomposition.
