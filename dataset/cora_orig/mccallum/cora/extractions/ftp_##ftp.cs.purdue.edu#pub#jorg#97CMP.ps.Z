Title: Computing moments of piecewise polynomial surfaces  
Author: Carlos Gonzalez-Ochoa Scott McCammon Jorg Peters 
Date: March 7, 1997  
Abstract: Combining the advantages of a low-degree polynomial surface representation with Gauss' divergence theorem allows efficient and exact calculation of the moments of objects enclosed by a free-form surface. Volume, center of mass and the inertia tensor can be computed in seconds even for complex objects with 10 5 patches while changes due to local modification of the surface geometry can be computed in real time as feedback for animation or design. Speed and simplicity of the approach allow solving the inverse problem of modelling to match prescribed moments.

Reference-contexts: For example, S-patches [3] and the recent construction by Hughes and Grimm [7] are rational and of high degree so that integrals are best evaluated by numerical approximation. Simplex splines [6] use a large number of pieces and generalized subdivision surfaces, e.g. [4] <ref> [1] </ref> [13], lack a global analytic definition for application of the divergence theorem. Standard tensor-product B-splines match the requirements but fail at modeling smooth surfaces of arbitrary patch layout or topological genus. Trimmed NURBS patches on the other hand generically violate the requirement of simple domains.

Reference-contexts: However, it pointed out that for efficient and exact computability of the moments the following properties of the surface patches are desirable. 1. polynomial patches 2. low degree patches 3. few patches 4. simple domains These properties rule out several otherwise excellent surface representations. For example, S-patches <ref> [3] </ref> and the recent construction by Hughes and Grimm [7] are rational and of high degree so that integrals are best evaluated by numerical approximation.

Reference-contexts: Surface splines come in three flavors, with an underlying representation of exclusively 4-sided, exclusively 3-sided and a mixture of 3-and 4-sided patches, respectively. Exclusively 4-sided patches have recently been used for reconstruction <ref> [5] </ref>. However, the exclusively 3-sided and the mixed representation have better shape properties, satisfy the strong local convex hull property and have lower algebraic and parametric degree. Moreover, they too can be represented as standard linearly-trimmed NURBS quilts and hence stored, transmitted and rendered in standard form [11].

Reference-contexts: In Section 2, we show how Gauss' divergence theorem reduces the computation of the moments of a solid to the evaluation of an integral over the surface that can be evaluated explicitly if the surface has a piecewise polynomial parametrization. In Section 3, we select surface splines <ref> [10] </ref> as the currently most appropriate representation of smooth free-form surfaces for fast and exact moment computation. In Section 4, we discuss the details of the evaluation of the surface integrals as simple averages and bound the computation effort. <p> Standard tensor-product B-splines match the requirements but fail at modeling smooth surfaces of arbitrary patch layout or topological genus. Trimmed NURBS patches on the other hand generically violate the requirement of simple domains. Surface splines <ref> [10] </ref> seem to best fit the bill. Surface splines define a piecewise cubic manifold capable of modeling smooth and non-smooth surfaces of arbitrary patch layout and topological genus. The embedding of the smooth manifold into R 3 is locally governed by so-called cut ratios.
