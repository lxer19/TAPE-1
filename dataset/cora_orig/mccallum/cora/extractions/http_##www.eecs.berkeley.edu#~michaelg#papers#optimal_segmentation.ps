Abstract: The idea of optimal joint time segmentation and resource allocation for signal modeling is explored with respect to arbitrary segmentations and arbitrary representation schemes. When the chosen signal modeling techniques can be quantified in terms of a cost function which is additive over distinct segments, a dynamic programming approach guarantees the global optimality of the scheme while keeping the computational requirements of the algorithm sufficiently low. Two immediate applications of the algorithm to LPC speech coding and to sinusoidal modeling of musical signals are presented.

In this paper we explore further the possibilities of adaptive representations by using more general models, in particular linear prediction and sinusoidal modeling. The main goal is to achieve better segmentations of time, and better local models.

The search is done in an operational rate-distortion (R/D) framework. <p> If S possesses some form of hierarchical structure, the previous minimization can be carried out very efficiently by means of dynamic programming. 3. INCREMENTAL ALGORITHM FOR DYNAMIC SEGMENTATION Following the lines exposed in <ref> [4] </ref>, we will now briefly review how to efficiently explore the space of possible seg mentations/resource allocation. For a data segment X, we define a minimal analysis block of length L samples, which we will call a cell, and we assume that X has M cells, or M L samples.

Reference-contexts: The window design problem is usually ad-hoc in the sense that it relies on a priori information on the physical properties of the signal. In LPC speech coding, for instance, a frame size of 16-20 ms is usually recommended <ref> [5] </ref>. Once the input data is thus suitably segmented, the bit-allocation problem can be dealt with in several ways; global optimality cannot however be attained if the segmentation process is not part of the R/D optimization process.

Reference-contexts: This problem has been addressed before in conjunction with speech coding techniques (see for example <ref> [6] </ref>); in the case of LPC coding in particular, the LPC coefficients for a given segment are obtained from the estimated autocorrelation function and, since segments are coded independently, the values for this estimate depend only on the local windowed data.

Reference-contexts: Estimation of the model parameters is typically carried out using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a fixed analysis frame size and a fixed stride between frames; a typical stride is half the frame size. The sinusoids are extracted by peak-picking in the STFT magnitude spectrum <ref> [8] </ref>. Such an analysis yields a frame-rate representation of the amplitude A q (t) and total phase fi q (t) of the constituent partials; in synthesis, these parameters are used to drive a bank of oscillators whose outputs are accumulated in accordance with the signal model. <p> Because of its simplicity and flexibility, this representation in terms of sinusoidal parameters has proven effective for applications in speech coding and audio analysis-transformation-synthesis <ref> [8, 9] </ref>. The method, however, does have significant drawbacks for representing transient signals such as the attack of a musical note; this is explained by the following consideration of the sinusoidal synthesis algorithm. <p> This interpolation is typically done using low-order polynomial models such as linear amplitude and cubic total phase; these models are constrained to meet amplitude, frequency, and phase-matching criteria at the synthesis frame boundaries <ref> [8] </ref>, which are separated in time by the analysis stride. Fundamentally, the fixed-stride STFT analysis results in a delocalization of transient events such as attacks.
