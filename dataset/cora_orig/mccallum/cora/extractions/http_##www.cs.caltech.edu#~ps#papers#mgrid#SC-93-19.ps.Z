Reference-contexts: In the remaining case, the assertion follows in a symmetrical way. An approximate scheme based on exact fine grid corrections v fl l , l 2 fl j , and dampened coarse grid corrections v l = ! l v fl l , ! l 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, l 2 M c , respectively, is called extended underrelaxation. Lemma 2.2 states that an extended under-relaxation is induced by a sequence of monotone approximations (@ - l ) -0 . <p> The resulting discrete problems (1.6) are solved iteratively by the standard monotone multigrid method STDKH (c.f. Theorem 3.1) and the truncated version TRCKH (c.f. Theorem 3.2). The implementation was carried out in the framework of the finite element code KASKADE (c.f. Erdmann, Lang and Roitzsch <ref> [1] </ref>) and we used a SPARC IPX Workstation for the computations. Let us consider the convergence behavior for the spatial problem resulting from the initial time step.

Reference-contexts: More general boundary conditions can be treated in the usual way. It is well-known (c.f.

Reference-contexts: The construction of the previous multigrid methods was based on the full approximation scheme so that the possible implementation as a multigrid V-cycle was clear from the very beginning. However, suitable conditions for convergence were less obvious. Following the first part of this paper <ref> [18] </ref>, we will derive monotone multigrid methods by extending the set of (high-frequent) search directions fl j by additional (intentionally low-frequent) search directions. <p> Consequently, the coarse-grid corrections of our monotone multigrid methods are obtained from certain obstacle problems, which are fixed by the preceding fine grid smoothing. In this way, the coupling of different phases is not excluded. Following the first part of this paper <ref> [18] </ref>, we consider a standard monotone multigrid method and a truncated variant, relying on the multilevel nodal basis and its adaptation to the actual guess of the free boundary, respectively. Both methods can be regarded as permanent extensions of the classical multigrid method and of the corresponding algorithms presented in [18]. <p> <ref> [18] </ref>, we consider a standard monotone multigrid method and a truncated variant, relying on the multilevel nodal basis and its adaptation to the actual guess of the free boundary, respectively. Both methods can be regarded as permanent extensions of the classical multigrid method and of the corresponding algorithms presented in [18]. By construction, we obtain global convergence and the asymptotic convergence rates are bounded by 1 O (j 3 ). In our numerical experiments reported in the final section, we basically found the same behavior as for obstacle problems (c.f. [18]). <p> classical multigrid method and of the corresponding algorithms presented in <ref> [18] </ref>. By construction, we obtain global convergence and the asymptotic convergence rates are bounded by 1 O (j 3 ). In our numerical experiments reported in the final section, we basically found the same behavior as for obstacle problems (c.f. [18]). In particular, for good initial iterates as obtained by nested iteration, the overall convergence is dominated by the optimal asymptotic convergence rates, which are inherited from the related linear case. Compared to previous multigrid methods, this leads to a significant improvement in asymptotic efficiency. <p> We now generalize a related result from the first part of this paper <ref> [18] </ref>. Lemma 2.2 Assume that @ l is a monotone approximation of @ l . Then the corrections v fl l and v l , computed from (2.8) and (2.14), respectively, are related by v l = ! l v fl Proof. <p> The following Theorem is an immediate consequence of this property and the convergence of the fine grid relaxation. Theorem 2.1 An extended underrelaxation is globally convergent. We omit the proof, which can be almost literally taken from <ref> [18] </ref>. <p> We first consider the constant search directions M - = fl, - 0, with coarse grid functions given by fl c = fl n fl j . In this way, we will generalize the standard monotone multigrid method proposed in the first part of this paper <ref> [18] </ref>. It is clear that fl is regular. Due to the ordering of the search directions fl, each iteration step starts with a fine grid smoothing of the given iterate u - j , involving the search directions l 2 fl j . <p> The restricted successive minimization of the energy functional J + j on K j in the directions l 2 fl c leads to the same type of local obstacle problems as we have already considered in the first part of this paper <ref> [18] </ref>. Hence, we can directly apply all the arguments and algorithms presented therein. In particular, the exact solution of the resulting local obstacle problems is still not available at reasonable cost. <p> Note that the resulting standard monotone multigrid method can be implemented as a classical V-cycle. We refer to <ref> [18] </ref> for details. 13 To apply the convergence theory developed in the preceding section, we re-formulate (3.5) as a scalar inclusion of the form (2.14). <p> By the definition of the quasioptimality of - l , and l (c.f. <ref> [18, 19] </ref>), there is a positive number fl 2 R and a threshold -1 -0 , such that - - l (p); p 2 N j " int supp l ; - -1 ; (3.10) holds if l is vanishing on N * j (u j ). <p> This completes the proof. Exploiting recent estimates of the convergence rates for the linear reduced problem (c.f. <ref> [18, 19] </ref>), the following theorem is an immediate consequence of Lemma 3.1 and Theorem 2.2. Theorem 3.1 The standard monotone multigrid method induced by the local coarse grid problems (3.5) is globally convergent. <p> Note that the error estimate (3.12) requires no additional regularity assump tions. On the other hand, this result is restricted to two space dimensions. We refer to <ref> [18, 19] </ref> for a detailed discussion. Obviously, there are no contributions from coarse grid functions l 2 fl c n fl ffi , once the correct phases are fixed. However, the reduced splitting induced by fl ffi may be rather poor, leading to unsatisfying asymptotic convergence rates (c.f.
