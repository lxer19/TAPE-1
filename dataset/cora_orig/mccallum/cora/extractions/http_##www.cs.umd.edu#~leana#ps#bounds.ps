Title: Bounding of Performance Measures for a Threshold-based Queueing System with Hysteresis

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a K-server threshold-based queueing system with hysteresis in which the number of servers, employed for servicing customers, is governed by a forward threshold vector F = (F 1 ; F 2 ; : : : ; F K1 ) (where F 1 &lt; F 2 &lt; &lt; F K1 ) and a reverse threshold vector R= (R 1 ; R 2 ; : : : ; R K1 ) (where R 1 &lt; R 2 &lt; &lt; R K1 ). There are many applications where a threshold-based queueing system can be of great use. The main motivation for using a threshold-based approach in such applications is that they incur significant server setup, usage, and removal costs. And, as in most practical situations, an important concern is not only the system performance but rather its cost/performance ratio. The motivation for use of hysteresis is to control the cost during momentary fluctuations in workload. An important and distinguishing characteristic of our work is that in our model we consider the time to add a server to be non-negligible. This is a more accurate model, for many applications, than previously considered in other works. Our main goal in this work is to develop an efficient method for computing the steady state probabilities of a multi-server threshold queueing system with hysteresis, which will, in turn, allow computation of various performance measures.

Reference-contexts: One approach to reducing the computational complexity is to partition M into sub-parts, solve each subpart separately, and then combine the solutions, i.e., through the method of decomposition <ref> [1] </ref>. In our model, we can partition M into K sub-parts, each corresponding to set S i , for 0 i K. Solving each S i separately will allow us to lower the computational cost 5 . <p> By applying the state aggregation technique <ref> [1] </ref>, we can aggregate each set into a single state and then compute the steady state probabilities for the aggregated process, i.e., the probabilities of the system being in any given set (see Section 4.3). <p> Lastly, we can compute the individual (unconditional) steady state probabilities of the original Markov process M <ref> [1] </ref>; these can in turn be used to compute various related performance measures.

Reference-contexts: X is stochastically less than Y (X st Y ) iff P [Y &lt; t] P [X &lt; t] 8t. Theorem 4 If N (0) st N u (0), then we have N (t) st N u (t) 8t. Proof: Omitted due to lack of space; please refer to <ref> [2] </ref>. 5.3 Numerical Computation for model M u In this section, we present a numerical computation procedure for the upper bound model M u . Our goal here will be to partition the upper bound model into disjoint sets and apply the stochastic complementation approach of Section 3.2. <p> Note that, it is possible to have an alternative upper bound model. For details, please refer to <ref> [2] </ref>. 6 Lower Bound In this section, we describe a model which can provide lower bounds on the desired performance measures for the model described in Section 2, namely, the mean number of customers and the mean system response time. <p> For details, please refer to <ref> [2] </ref>. The proof that M l provides a lower bound on the desired performance measures and the numerical computation of these measures using M l are very similar to those given in the context of M u (see Sections 5.2 and 5.3).

Reference-contexts: Since for many applications this time is non-negligible, we consider it an important and distinguishing characteristic of our work. We first give an exact solution for computing the steady state probabilities of our model using the matrix geometric method <ref> [21] </ref>. However, we feel that the exact solution is not efficient. And, thus, the main contribution of this paper is an efficient solution of a threshold-based queueing system with hysteresis obtained through a computation of tight performance bounds. <p> More specifically, we compute the steady state probabilities of the bounding models using a combination of stochastic complementation [17] and the matrix geometric <ref> [21] </ref> methods.

Reference-contexts: At this point we can compute the steady state probability vector, given that the system is in S 2 , using a variety of methods (refer to <ref> [22] </ref>). Once that is done, we can easily compute N S 2 . For level S l , where 3 l K 1, we first note that there is a single entry state from the states in S l+1 . <p> Then we can compute the conditional state probabilities given that the system is in S l using a variety of methods (refer to <ref> [22] </ref>). Once the conditional steady state probability vector is determined, we can easily compute N S l , for 3 l K 1. The computation of the conditional state probabilities for set S K is somewhat different.
