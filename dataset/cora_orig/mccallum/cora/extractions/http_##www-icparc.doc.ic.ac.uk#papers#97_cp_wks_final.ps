Title: Restart-repair and Learning: An empirical study of single solution 3-SAT problems  
Author: E Thomas Richards and Barry Richards

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that a particular nonsystematic search algorithm based on restart-repair and learning no-goods can solve single solution 3-SAT problems efficiently. These problems are thought to present a severe challenge for algorithms of this sort since the burden of handling no-goods will rapidly become insupportable. We show that this is not the case here. The results are compared to those produced on the same set of problems by an algorithm widely believed to be the best option available, viz. the Tableau algorithm enhanced with conflict directed backjumping and 3 rd order learning [Bayardo & Schrag 1996]. In certain cases the nonsystematic search algorithm does better, and in others it does not. In all cases the margin of difference is measured in a small constant factor. These results serve to support the larger aim of this research, to develop an effective generic search technique. In this paper this dynamic constraint satisfaction technique is applied to static problems. A simple extension enables this algorithm to be used in a dynamic context.

Reference-contexts: With a view to probing this potential further, we shall undertake an empirical investigation of RestartRepair-Lbm+FC- on a class of hard 3-SAT problems, viz. problems with exactly one solution. These constitute the AIM problem set, styled after the authors of the generator <ref> [Asahiro et al., 1995] </ref> . It is arguable that that these problems represent a testing challenge for RestartRepair-Lbm+FC-. Since they have only one solution, any algorithm based on nonsystematic search should find them very difficult to solve.

Reference-contexts: To gain a secure perspective on relative performance and viability, we shall take as a reference point an algorithm developed by Bayardo & Schrag [1996]; this enhances the Tableau algorithm of Crawford & Auton [1996] with conflict-directed-backjumping (CBJ) <ref> [Prosser, 1993] </ref> and third-order learning [Frost & Dechter, 1994]. Here learning is restricted to no-goods which involve at most three variables. This algorithm, which we call Tableau-CBJ+3 rd Lrn-, has been shown to perform very well on exceptionally hard SAT problems.

Reference-contexts: Weak commitment records the whole deadend assignment as a no-good. In contrast, RestartRepair-Lbm+FC+MC- records only relevant parts of the assignment. The shorter no-good, which is learnt at a deadend, is identified through learning-by-merging <ref> [Richards et al., 1995] </ref>. These shorter no-goods serve to prune large parts of the search space more efficiently.

Reference-contexts: In Richards & Richards [1996] we show that for a variety of different kinds of problems RestartRepair-Lbm+FC+MC- outperforms weak commitment supplemented with FC, and t hat learning-by-merging improves the search performance significantly as problems became hard to solve. RestartRepair-Lbm+FC+MC- also performs better than GSAT <ref> [Selman et al., 1992] </ref> and the WEIGHT search strategy [Morris, 1993] for a subset of the single solution 3-SAT problems.
