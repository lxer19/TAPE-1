Abstract: In this paper we present a simulation study of autonomous automated vehicle operation on the Houston Katy Corridor. The simulation study was built on top of the SHIFT/SMART-AHS system. We developed the control algorithm for autonomous automated vehicles driving on a highway with multiple merge junctions. The algorithm is distributed and it controls both merging and yielding operations of vehicles in the merge lane and main lane respectively. Using this control system we evaluated the impact on safety and congestion on the Katy Corridor under different travel demand conditions and technology assumptions. The immediate conclusion we reached is that only the low level demands hypothesized by the Houston Metro Transportation Authority are feasible for autonomous automated vehicles.

Reference-contexts: Hence several metropolitan transportation agencies are turning towards higher levels of automation technologies to address these problems. c fl 1997 IEEE, ITSC97 - Boston USA proc. of the IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems Different traffic automation strategies have been proposed. <ref> [1] </ref> Typically they are classified according to their distribution of intelligence attributes. Here, intelligence refers to the techniques used to govern the flow of traffic. At one end of the spectrum, all automation intelligence is concentrated within individual vehiclesleading to the autonomous scenario.

Reference-contexts: We studied two travel demand characteristics: low intensity and high intensity. These were taken from projections made by the Houston Metropolitan Transit Authority. <ref> [2] </ref> We used the origin-destination travel demand [6] derived from this data. The low intensity travel demand is shown in Table 1. The high intensity travel demand is shown in Table 2. We ensured that new vehicles would not enter the highway in an unsafe configuration in case of congestion.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we use the Smart-AHS <ref> [4] </ref> microsimulation approach which has been designed to answer such questions in a wide range of highway layout and travel demand scenarios. Smart-AHS provides the infrastructure elements for simulating vehicle-highway systems.

Reference-contexts: Smart-AHS provides the infrastructure elements for simulating vehicle-highway systems. It contains simulation models for highway layout, traffic sources and sinks, vehicle models at different fidelity levels, actuator models, physical level controller models, sensor models and communication models. Smart-AHS is provided as a collection of libraries written in the SHIFT <ref> [5] </ref> programming language. SHIFT is a programming language for describing dynamic networks of hybrid automata. Such systems consist of components which can be created, interconnected and destroyed as the system evolves. Components exhibit hybrid behavior, consisting of continuous-time phases separated by discrete-event transitions.

Table 5: Results for the Low Intensity, 1 sec Headway Case. In this case we see that while the distribution of the gap is almost random, there is no significant loss of speed. Hence this would be a viable choice of parameters. Table 6: Results for the High Intensity, 1 sec Headway Case. In this case we see that there is a congestion build-up at the third merge junction. </title>
