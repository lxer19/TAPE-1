Title: On Computing Algebraic Functions using Logarithms and Exponentials  
Author: Dima Grigoriev Michael Singer and Andrew Yao 
Abstract: Let be a set of algebraic expressions constructed with radicals and arithmetic operations, and which generate the splitting field F of some polynomial. Let N fi () be the minimum total number of root-takings and exponentiations used in any straightline program for computing the functions in by taking roots, exponentials, logarithms, and performing arithmetic operations. In this paper it is proved that N fi () = -(G), where -(G) is the minimum length of any cyclic Jordan-Holder tower for the Galois group G of F . This generalizes a result of Ja'Ja' [1], and shows that the inclusion of certain new primitives, such as taking exponentials and logarithms, does not improve the cost of computing such expressions as compared with programs which use only root-takings.

Reference-contexts: It was shown [6,7] that, when the members of are rational functions of the roots of rational functions, the mimimum cost is equal to the number of the torsion orders 4 for the Galois group of F (an Abelian group in this case). An extension was given in Ja'Ja' <ref> [1] </ref>, who showed that the minimum cost is equal to the minimum length of any cyclic Jordan-Holder tower for the Galois group of F, provided that F is a finite Galois extension over the field of rational functions. <p> In this paper, we show that under the same assumption as in <ref> [1] </ref> (i.e. F being a finite Galois extension), the availability of taking logarithms and exponentials does not reduce the cost. In particular, we prove that n or more operations are needed to evaluate P p x i , with arithmetic operations given for free. <p> Clearly, N ff () is finite. For any such , we can form the field F 0 () which is the algebraic extension of F 0 formed by adjoining the functions corredponding to the elements f 1 ; ; f s of . Following <ref> [1] </ref>, is said to be normal, if F 0 () is a finite Galois extension of F 0 . In other words, is normal if generates the splitting field of some polynomial over F 0 . <p> G 1 . . G m1 . G m = 1; where G i1 =G i is cyclic for each 1 i m. Let -(G) be the length m of the shortest cyclic Jordan-Holder tower for G. 3 The next result is from Ja'Ja' <ref> [1] </ref> which we state as a lemma: Lemma 1 [1] If is normal, then N ff () = -(G), where G is the Galois group for F 0 () over F 0 . <p> G m1 . G m = 1; where G i1 =G i is cyclic for each 1 i m. Let -(G) be the length m of the shortest cyclic Jordan-Holder tower for G. 3 The next result is from Ja'Ja' <ref> [1] </ref> which we state as a lemma: Lemma 1 [1] If is normal, then N ff () = -(G), where G is the Galois group for F 0 () over F 0 . <p> Corollary 1 follows immediately from the theorem and Lemma 1. To prove Corollary 2, we note that is normal and the Galois group G of F 0 () over F 0 is isomorphic to Z 2 n . &gt;From the result in <ref> [1, 7] </ref> (see [7, p. 399, Lemma 3.2]), -(G) is equal to the number of torsion orders of G which is cleary n. Corollary 2 follows from the theorem immediately.

Reference-contexts: It is known [1,7] that the former result is a special case of the latter. These results can be used to determine the minimum cost for computing in many cases. For example, for the mean distance problem, the Galois group can be shown <ref> [6] </ref> to be isomorphic to (Z 2 ) ( n 2 ) , which clearly has n torsion orders.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The question of how efficiently one can evaluate expressions such as 1i&lt;jn (x i x j ) 2 + (y i y j ) 2 = 2 , the mean distance among n points in the plane, was raised in Shamos and Yuval <ref> [8] </ref>. A systematic study of this question was given in Pippenger [6,7]. Let be a family of algebraic expressions constructed &gt;from inde-terminates using radicals and arithmetic operations. Define the cost of a program to be the number of root-takings used, with arithmetic operations given for free. <p> In particular, can one evaluate the expression P p x i using o (n) exponentiations and logarithm-takings? (Clearly, the expression can be evaluated with n root-takings.) The possible use of logarithms and exponentials, as well as other primitives, was mentioned in <ref> [8] </ref>, but was not studied in later papers [1,6,7]. In this paper, we show that under the same assumption as in [1] (i.e. F being a finite Galois extension), the availability of taking logarithms and exponentials does not reduce the cost.
