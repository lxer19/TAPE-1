Title: Design and Implementation of a Web-based Tool for ATM Connection Management  
Author: Martin Bernhardt 
Date: August 1996  
Pubnum: TR-96-041  
Abstract: At the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI), there is an ongoing effort to gain experience on ATM and multi-media applications. ICSI is participating in two ATM pilots called Bay Area Gigabit Network (BAGNet) and Multimedia Applications on Intercontinental Highway (MAY). Beside these wide-area trial ICSI's ATM network is used for local multi-media experiments. The ATM environment at ICSI is heterogeneous. Both, local and long distance traffic is based on permanent virtual connections. The management of this environment has often been cumbersome and time-consuming for a number of reasons: The ATM devices have to be accessed separately in an unintegrated manner. Different vendor-specific tools with different user interfaces are used. Configuration data is stored unstructured, redundant and not centralized. Users cannot setup or verify a connection without knowing device-specific details. Hence, the need for a software tool arose that can minimize the administrative work spent on connection management. This technical report contains my master's thesis which is about the design and implementation of TOMCAD a tool for monitoring and configuration of ATM devices. Being a web-based software tool it can support local and wide-area connectivity and provide access for local and remote users.

Reference-contexts: ATM offers the capability of data transmission with minimum delay and guaranteed quality of service (QoS). 2.1.1 Basic concepts An ATM network consists of a set of interconnected ATM devices (Fig. 2.1) 1 . ATM hosts are workstations or PCs equipped with an ATM network inter 1 source: <ref> [1] </ref> 6 Background face connector (NIC). Unlike shared-media network technologies like Ethernet, ATM requires a switch to interconnect end-systems via point-to-point connections. A switch provides an array of ports to attach ATM end-systems or other switches. <p> Hence, address resolution protocols have to be defined to map higher layer protocol addresses on ATM addresses. Three kinds of 20 byte address formats were defined for use in private ATM networks <ref> [1] </ref>. Section 3.1 outlines different ways to overlay the internet protocol (IP) on ATM. 2.2 ATM connection management 2.2.1 ATM layer management The ITU-T defined the ATM reference model that consists of three planes (Fig. 2.3).

Reference-contexts: Two ATM end-systems have to implement the same AAL in order to communicate. For end-systems in private LANs, AAL5 is recommended by the ATM Forum. The functions at the ATM layer as specified by the ATM Forum for the UNI fall into two basic categories <ref> [2] </ref>. These are switching functions and management functions (according to the control plane and the management plane of the reference model). <p> For the time until standards are finalized by the ITU-T for B-ISDN, the ATM Forum defined an interim local management specification (ILMI) <ref> [2] </ref>. ILMI supports bi-directional exchange of management information between UNI management entities (UMEs) (Fig. 2.4]) 2 . The communication between two UMEs is protocol symmetric, i.e. each UME contains an agent and a manager application. The management information is stored in a management information base (MIB) at each UME.

Reference-contexts: An ATM connection management tool for ICSI's environment must provide a function to perform IP/VC configuration at the hosts. This requires a mapping scheme and the administration of IP addresses and VPI/VCI pairs. 26 Requirements for a connection management tool Concept Description LANE <ref> [3] </ref> A standard by the ATM Forum for emulating Ethernet or Token Ring LANs on ATM networks.

Different network layer protocols have to be multiplexed on different virtual connections since only one single protocol can be carried on a virtual connection. No packet type field is used since the type of protocol is defined implicitly at connection setup.

Reference-contexts: A client application (web browser) requests information from web servers using the HTTP protocol. Information is coded in HTML, a page-definition language which features simple, generic formatting statements (tags) <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Standards for the M1- and M2-interface are not yet finalized. Since 1988, there is an ongoing standardization effort of the ITU-T and other institutions around a communications concept called telecommunications management network (TMN) <ref> [7] </ref>. TMN defines a protocol-independent management framework for large interconnected public and private networks. It includes a five layer model for all kinds of management functions, ranging from vendor-specific hardware configuration to billing functions. TMN standards are designed to meet the needs of heterogeneous wide-area ATM networks.

Reference-contexts: CGI provides a method to generate web pages dynamically. However, the processing workload is on the server-side. Since the client cannot control the execution of CGI-binaries, their scope is usually limited to short transactions like database queries. In 1995, Sun Microsystems introduced a programming language called Java <ref> [15, 16] </ref>. Since Java-bytecode is architecture neutral it can be interpreted on any machine that provides a Java-runtime-system (virtual machine). This allows for the implementation of mobile code as part of HTML-code (Java applets). Web browsers that feature a virtual machine can download and process Java Applets.
