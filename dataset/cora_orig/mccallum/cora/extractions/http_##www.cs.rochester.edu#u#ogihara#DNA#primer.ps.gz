Abstract: This paper proposes a method for simulating Boolean circuits based on primer extension and DNA cleavage. The advantage of the current method is the requirement of little human intervention during the course of simulation. The paper also explores the potential of RecA-assisted DNA-DNA hybridization in DNA-based computation. The method could in principle allow simulation of many levels of large Boolean cir cuits in a single test tube.

Reference-contexts: Also, the equilibrium nature of hybridization suggests that simulation of any gate that converts negative information to positive, and vice versa, is a very difficult problem to implementone will always have to worry about errors caused by strands that are not converted. An interesting paper <ref> (Amos et al. 1997) </ref> described a simple scheme for simulating the NAND-gate. Based on this scheme, the authors proposed a method for simulating Boolean circuits. However, the problem of coping with errors due to DNA strands that remain intact because of chemical equilibrium is yet to be solved.

Reference-contexts: The second order rate constant for DNA-DNA annealing is approximately 10 6 M 1 s 1 <ref> (Cantor and Schimmel 1980, page 1272) </ref>. Therefore the initial rate of annealing of two oligonucleotides, each present in 10 13 M concentration (per base) is 10 6 fi (10 13 ) 2 , i.e., 10 20 Ms 1 .

Reference-contexts: If one of the dNTPs is fluorescent-labeled, then the output can be detected by pouring the reaction content over a `DNA-chip' with the complements of the outputs immobilized on the surface <ref> (Chee et al. 1996) </ref>. Annealing of the fluorescent labeled molecules will be read out by a confocal microscope. The outputs of one circuit computation may be used to determine the input of another round of computation in a fresh tube.

Reference-contexts: RecA protein subunits bind to single-stranded DNA and the complex searches for sequence homology by a second order reaction kinetics but catalyzes strand transfer by a first order reaction with a rate constant of 5 fi 10 3 s 1 <ref> (Gonda and Radding 1986, Bazemore et al. 1997) </ref>. The rate of primer extension is approximately 300 nucleotides per second. With these considerations, we estimate that the best rate for a circuit of depth at most 40, which is of size at most 10 14 , will be approximately 500 seconds.

Reference-contexts: In those cases, thermostable RecA protein (Yu et al. 1995) will also be present in the mixture. Note that ATP is not essential for searching and strand transfer of short (15-30 bases) oligomeric sequences by RecA <ref> (Hsieh et al. 1992) </ref>. The computation will be initiated by adding a mixture of all the input variable nucleotides corresponding to the value of 1 to the computation tube, and raising the temperature to optimum for primer extension. For 15-25 nucleotide overlaps, approximately 65 ffi C should be optimal.

Reference-contexts: In order to conduct a large scale circuit simulation with DNA, a crucial consideration is how rapidly sequence-specific DNA-DNA hybridization occurs when billions of DNA strands are present. This paper suggests the use of RecA protein <ref> (Kowalczykowski and Eggleston 1994) </ref> for assisting DNA-DNA hybridization. With the use of RecA protein, the reaction can be accelerated to the speed of one level per second if there are at most 10 14 strands present in the test tube. <p> Because of the second order kinetics of DNA annealing, this will produce approximately 1 duplex per second per liter. In order to overcome the kinetic barrier, we propose to examine the use of RecA protein <ref> (Kowalczykowski and Eggleston 1994) </ref> from Escherichia coli to speed up the homology search process.

Reference-contexts: This model has been further simplified in a subsequent paper <ref> (Ogihara and Ray 1998) </ref>, which proposes seemingly the smallest meaningful DNA computation model consisting of just five simple operations, i.e., synthesize, merge, anneal, separate-by-length, and detect, and characterizes its computational power in terms of Boolean circuit complexity classes.

Reference-contexts: So, by (*) w00 and w01 are both created by primer extension. Since the second part of 2 Several restriction endonucleases cleave the unmethylated strand in a hemimethylated target, e.g., EcoRI (Jen-Jacobson et al. 1996), HaeIII, BsuR, and Sau3AI <ref> (Sambrook et al. 1989) </ref>. However, these are not thermostable. Perhaps the most thermostable one is TaqI, which cleaves unmethylated 5 0 -TCGA-3 0 duplexes, but not a fully A-methylated target. The hemimethy-lated target is cleaved but the strand preference is yet to be determined.
