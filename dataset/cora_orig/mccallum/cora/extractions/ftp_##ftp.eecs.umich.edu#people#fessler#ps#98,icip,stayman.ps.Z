Abstract: Traditional space-invariant regularization schemes in tomographic image reconstruction using penalized-likelihood estimators produce images with nonuniform resolution properties. The local point spread functions that quantify the local smoothing properties of such estimators are not only space-variant and asymmetric, but are also object-dependent even for space-invariant systems. We propose a new regularization scheme for increased spatial uniformity and demonstrate the resolution properties of this new method versus conventional regularization schemes through an investigation of local point spread functions.

Reference-contexts: Regularization can also improve the conditioning of the problem leading to faster convergence. However, there are also disadvantages with conventional regularization schemes. Space-invariant penalties lead to object-dependent nonuniform resolution properties <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. Specifically, such estimators tend to smooth the image more in high count regions than in low count regions. <p> There is a direct relationship between f c and the global full-width half-maximum (FWHM) resolution of the reconstructed image. Such a direct relation does not exist with penalized-likelihood reconstructions with conventional regularizations. One attempt to correct for the resolution nonuniformity has been presented in <ref> [4] </ref>. This regularization, based on the aggregate certainty of measurement rays intersecting each pixel, provides increased spatial uniformity over conventional space-invariant regularization. However, the local point spread functions are still highly asymmetric. <p> However, the local point spread functions are still highly asymmetric. We present a new parameterized penalty function, whose coefficients are found by a least-squares fitting of the parameterized local impulse response to a shift-invariant response. This new method provides increased spatial uniformity compared to the certainty-based method of <ref> [4] </ref> and conventional regularization techniques. We demonstrate this increased uniformity through an investigation of the local point spread functions. 2 Background Let = [ 1 ; : : : ; p ] 0 represent the nonnegative emission rates for an object discretized into p pixels. <p> For a second-order penalty, one often includes w jk = 1= p 2 for the diagonal neighbors in addition to the first-order neighbors. The mean reconstruction of an estimator is designated by Z The local impulse response <ref> [4] </ref> is defined as l j = lim ( + ffie j ) () ffi @ (); where e j represents the jth unit vector. This definition of the local impulse response is dependent on the estimator, the object, and the pixel position j. From [4], for penalized-likelihood with quadratic penalties, <p> Z The local impulse response <ref> [4] </ref> is defined as l j = lim ( + ffie j ) () ffi @ (); where e j represents the jth unit vector. This definition of the local impulse response is dependent on the estimator, the object, and the pixel position j. From [4], for penalized-likelihood with quadratic penalties, the local im pulse response may be well approximated by l j [A 0 D A + fiR] 1 A 0 D Ae j ; (1) where A is a matrix of the fa ij g elements, and D is a diagonal matrix with elements <p> We investigate the resolution properties of four different quadratic regularizations: (I) The conventional space-invariant first-order penalty given by the kernel in (4), (II) the certainty-based penalty developed in <ref> [4] </ref>, (III) the constrained nonlinear least-squares (CNLLS) penalty given by equation (7), and (IV) the reduced computationally-efficient penalty we have proposed in this paper. <p> In this case, there is little to be gained from the computationally expensive CNLLS penalty. 5 Discussion Conventional space-invariant regularization methods for penalized-likelihood image reconstruction produce images with space-variant resolution properties. At present, the only method available that attempts to provide more uniform resolution is the certainty-based method of <ref> [4] </ref>. However, as we have seen in our investigations, this method does not provide truly uniform resolution properties. We have presented a new computationally-efficient regularization scheme for increased spatial uniformity. The proposed method is based on fitting an unweighted response with an arbitrary space-invariant penalty (equation (8)).

Reference-contexts: Regularization can also improve the conditioning of the problem leading to faster convergence. However, there are also disadvantages with conventional regularization schemes. Space-invariant penalties lead to object-dependent nonuniform resolution properties <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. Specifically, such estimators tend to smooth the image more in high count regions than in low count regions. <p> This step makes direct computation of (9) a slow process. One can show that in an idealized continuous system, if the continuous equivalent of W is a radially-constant sino-gram scaling operator, then the continuous equivalent of G 0 W G can be expressed as a position-independent blurring operation <ref> [5] </ref>. Therefore, this should be approximately true in the discrete case. If W were radially-constant, we would only need one computation of F fG 0 W Ge j g. In practice we cannot expect the radially-constant assumption to hold.
