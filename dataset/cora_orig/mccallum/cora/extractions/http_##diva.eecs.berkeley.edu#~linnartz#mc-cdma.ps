Abstract: In this paper, a novel digital modulation technique called Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) is analyzed. With MC-CDMA, each data symbol is transmitted at multiple subcarriers with each subcarrier modulated by 1 or -1 based on a spreading code. Analytical results are presented on the performance of this modulation/multiple access scheme in the downlink of an indoor wireless Rician fading channel. The performance of a controlled equalization technique that attempts to restore the orthogonality between users is evaluated.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction This paper will extend on the results of a previous paper <ref> [1] </ref> involving the analysis of a new spread spectrum transmission method called MC-CDMA. MC-CDMA [1,2,3] addresses the issue of how to spread the signal bandwidth without increasing the adverse effects of the delay spread, which is a measure of the length of the channel impulse response. <p> As an MC-CDMA signal is composed of N narrowband subcarrier signals each with a symbol duration much larger than the delay spread, an MC-CDMA signal will not experience significant degradation from inter-chip interference and inter-symbol interference (ISI) [4,5]. In a previous paper <ref> [1] </ref>, MC-CDMA was analyzed in a Rayleigh fading channel. In contrast to the uplink, numerical results indicated that MC-CDMA performed better in the downlink where the ease of phase correction of the interference allows for the partial restoration of orthogonality between users. <p> This process yields a multi-carrier signal with the subcarriers containing the orthogonally coded data symbol. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the transmitted signal corresponding to the kth data bit of the mth user is (1) where c m [0], c m <ref> [1] </ref>, ... , c m [N-1] represents the spreading code of the mth user and is defined to be an unit amplitude pulse that is non-zero in the interval of [0, T b ]. s m t ( ) c m i [ ] a m k [ ] 2pf c <p> For the kth bit, the deci- sion variable is (7) where the corresponding AWGN term, , is given as . (8) In this paper, we will considered three frequency equalization techniques: Equal Gain Combining (EGC), Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC), and Controlled Equalization (CE). EGC and MRC are discussed in <ref> [1] </ref>. With EGC, the gain correction factor is . (9) With MRC, the gain correction factor is . (10) 4.1 Controlled Equalization (CE) While EGC may be desirable for simplicity and MRC for combating noise, neither of these techniques significantly exploit the coding of the subcarriers. <p> The probability of making a decision error can be written as . (17) Finding a closed form expression for the sum of N iid Rician r.v.s has been historically a difficult problem. In <ref> [1] </ref>, it was shown that using the CLT to approximate the sum of iid Rayleigh r.v.s leads to an adequate approximation. Applying the CLT to the sum of iid Rician r.v.s, the sum may also be approximated by a zero-mean gaussian distribution. <p> Numerical Results Plots of the average BER for Rician K-factors of 0 and 10 are shown in Fig. 3 for EGC and MRC. Note that for the Rayleigh fading case (K = 0) the expressions in Eqs. [18,19] reduce to the results derived in <ref> [1] </ref> for Ray-leigh fading. As in the case of Rayleigh fading, MRC has a better performance for very low number of interferers while EGC outperforms MRC in an interference limited Rician fading channel.

Reference-contexts: This assumption agrees with indoor measurements of Doppler shifts, which tend to be very small and typically in the range of 0.3-6.1 Hz <ref> [6] </ref>. For downlink transmissions, i.e., from the base station to the terminals, a terminal receives interfering signals designated for other users (m = 1, 2, ... , M-1) through the same channel as the wanted signal (m = 0).
