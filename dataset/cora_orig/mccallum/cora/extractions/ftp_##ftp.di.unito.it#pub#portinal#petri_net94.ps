Abstract: Backward reachability on Petri net models has been proposed since the beginning of the development of net theory without giving it a suitable motivation. For this reason, reachability analysis has been successively developed essentially by taking into account forward reachability. In this paper backward reachability analysis is motivated by showing its suitability to diagnostic problem solving. A particular technique for backward reachability analysis (B-W analysis) is defined for a net model called Behavioral Petri Net (BPN), intended to model the behavior of a system to be diagnosed. Such a technique is based on the use of two different types of tokens (normal and inhibitor tokens) whose aim is to represent the truth or falsity of the condition associated to a marked place. A distributed approach for parallel B-W analysis is also proposed. Such an approach is based on a set of processes derived from the structure of a BPN by means of a formal partitioning technique; this allows us to address the problem of mitigating the high inefficiency diagnostic algorithms usually have.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Backward reachability on Petri net models has been proposed since the beginning of the development of net theory (e.g. in the Condition/Event systems <ref> [1] </ref>) without giving it a suitable motivation. For this reason, reachability analysis has been successively developed essentially by taking into account forward reachability. However, progresses in fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI) showed that a lot of different practical tasks require inference to be performed in backward fashion [13].

Reference-contexts: On the other hand decentralized approaches are based on a set of sequential processes (each of them managing a set of transitions) running asynchronously and interacting by a communication/synchronization mechanism. As pointed out in <ref> [2] </ref> the centralized approach is not adequate when performance is the major concern, because of the intermediate coordinator process presence.

Reference-contexts: As a consequence, formal notions concerning diagnostic problems and their solutions can be re-formulated in the framework of Behavioral Petri Nets. Following <ref> [3] </ref>, a diagnostic problem can be suitably described by the 4-tuple DP =&lt; S; Exp; + ; &gt; where S is a set of logical formulae representing the model of the system to be diagnosed, Exp is a set of ground atoms in terms of which the solutions have to be <p> Notice that + is in general a suitable subset of the set of all the observations OBS (see also the example at the end of this section) and that different choices of + give rise to different definitions of diagnosis (see <ref> [3] </ref> for a more detailed discussion). Let us introduce the labeling : P ! B S where P is the set of places of a BPN and B S is the Herbrand base [6] of the logical model S (i.e. the set of ground atoms of S).

Reference-contexts: Other attempts to address the problem of diagnostic reasoning using Petri nets can be found in [8], where algebraic analysis is used to detect single-fault diagnoses using a set of production rules modeled as a Petri net, and more recently in [12], where the correspondence between linear logic <ref> [4] </ref> and Petri nets is exploited in order to diagnose flexible manufacturing systems. We rely on a general and formal theory of diagnosis where multiple fault can be naturally addressed and we consider systems for which underlying logic is much simpler than linear one.

Reference-contexts: However, when cyclic processes has to be modeled (as in the case of flexible manufacturing systems) the use of more complex frameworks is needed. Notice that B-W Analysis can be applied also to tasks different than diagnostic one; indeed, in <ref> [9] </ref>, the use of this type of analysis is proposed as a tool for the validation of a causal model (represented through a Petri net) following some correctness criteria and by detecting some errors that can happen when constructing the end-user model.

The possibility of using Petri nets in AI applications is recently receiving a lot of attention [7, 16]; the present work shows how Petri net-based and AI-based techniques can be successfully merged in diagnostic problem solving.

Reference-contexts: A marked Petri net = (N; 0 ) is deterministic if and only if 8 2 R (N; 0 ) 8t 1 ; t 2 2 T (if [t 1 &gt; and [t 2 &gt; then t 1 and t 2 are concurrent): 3 The Behavioral Petri Net Model In <ref> [11] </ref>, a Petri net model called Behavioral Petri Net (BP N ) was introduced in order to address the problem of model-based diagnosis [5] in a Petri net framework; indeed, a Behavioral Petri Net is intended to model the behavior of a system to be diagnosed, while reachability analysis on the <p> T OR are intended to represent the logical connective OR; a transition t 2 T OR (graphically represented as an empty thick bar) is said to be an OR-transition and it represents a macro transition whose semantics can be given in terms of a Petri net with inhibitor arcs (see <ref> [11] </ref>). Informally, a transition t 2 T OR has concession in a marking if and only if at least one of its input places is marked. <p> A marking such that no transition is enabled at is called a final marking. The following theorems have been proved in <ref> [11] </ref>. Theorem 1. A marked BPN is safe and deterministic; Theorem 2. In a marked BPN there exists exactly one final marking. <p> In <ref> [11] </ref> the equivalence between the BPN model and a particular class of logical models quite popular in model-based diagnosis (i.e. hierarchical definite logic programs) is discussed and formally shown. <p> Definition 17. A marking of a Behavioral Petri Net zero-covers a set of places Q if and only if 8p 2 Q ! (p) = 0. The notion of diagnostic solution can then be captured with the following theorem (that has been proved in <ref> [11] </ref>). Theorem 3. Given a diagnostic problem DP =&lt; N S ; P E ; P + ; P &gt;, an initial marking E is a solution to DP if and only if the final marking of N S covers P + and zero-covers P . <p> It should be noted that the introduction of the merge operation requires a slight modification of the activities associated to transitions (see <ref> [11] </ref> for more details). 7 An Example In this section we describe, as an example, the derivation of the parallel program implementing B-W analysis for the BPN depicted in figure 4 and its execution on a particular starting marking.

However, progresses in fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI) showed that a lot of different practical tasks require inference to be performed in backward fashion <ref> [13] </ref>. One of the most important task requiring backward reasoning is certainly represented by diagnostic problem solving.

Reference-contexts: In [11] the equivalence between the BPN model and a particular class of logical models quite popular in model-based diagnosis (i.e. hierarchical definite logic programs) is discussed and formally shown. In particular, following an approach pioneered in <ref> [17] </ref>, by suitably introducing a notion of "derivation" in the net model, it is possible to show its equivalence with respect to classical derivation in the logical model. As a consequence, formal notions concerning diagnostic problems and their solutions can be re-formulated in the framework of Behavioral Petri Nets.
