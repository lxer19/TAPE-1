Abstract: The spatial and temporal aspects of population dynamics are pivotal to computational biology. We developed a spatially explicit model of epidemics that behaves like a large probabilistic cellular automaton. The cells of the automaton are discrete sites into which the habitat is partitioned. Probabilistic local state transitions are executed synchronously at all sites making the simulation suitable for parallel implementation on SIMD architectures. An interpretation of the simulation results requires computing global parameters of the habitat that are challenging to implement efficiently on SIMD machines. For example, pattern detection and measurements use sophisticated image processing algorithms. In this paper, we discuss the parallel implementation of the epidemiological model and analyze its performance. The achieved results indicate that the use of a massively parallel machine was necessary and efficient.

Reference-contexts: The implementation of this measure is based on an algorithm developed by Cypher <ref> [2] </ref> for image component labeling on mesh connected SIMD machines. This is the least parallelizable operation that involves a small fraction of the total computation. * Relative Patchiness A measure of ecological diversity, i.e., the average rate of change of the landscape along some direction. <p> This is a well known problem in image processing applications and many algorithms have been proposed as its solution. The current implementation uses an algorithm developed by Cypher <ref> [2] </ref> for mesh connected SIMD machines with time complexity O ( p N ), where N denotes the number of pixels in the image.

Many natural systems, including epidemics, can be characterized by a global state that is defined as a vector of local states. Correspondingly, in the discussed model <ref> [5] </ref>, the composition of local transitions determines each global state transition. To simulate the spatial and temporal dynamics of a multi-species ecosystem, the model partitions its habitat into a grid of sites, such that each site has space for at most one host. <p> The ecological results are interpreted in Section 5 and conclusions and future directions are discussed in Section 6. 2. The Mathematical Model The formal definition of the probabilistic model on which the implementation is based is presented in <ref> [5] </ref>. Here, we briefly examine those features of the model that affect the structure of the implementation. The model partitions a two-dimensional habitat into sites. Each site can support at most one host organism.

Reference-contexts: In [9], we presented algorithms for the simultaneous reduction problem that take advantage of associativity and commutativity of binary operators used in reduction. Additional improvement is possible if this operator also has an inverse. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms was measured on the MasPar MP-1 and reported in <ref> [6] </ref>. In the described implementation, one of the proposed algorithms is used; namely, the so called row-column algorithm that takes advantage of fast "xnet" MasPar communication.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we discuss the implementation of spatially explicit models of epidemics on massively parallel computers. We designed and implemented two basic but ecologically significant models of epidemics: directly transmitted diseases, and vector-borne diseases. An example of a vector-borne disease is lizard malaria <ref> [7] </ref>, where mosquitoes, not themselves affected by the pathogen, transmit the disease from infective (sick), to susceptible (healthy) individuals from two lizard species. fl Supported in part by ONR Grant N00014-93-1-0076 and an IBM Corp.

Reference-contexts: The main algorithmic challenges were: * Computation of Transition Probabilities These probabilities are used in selecting the next state of each site. Computing them involves simultaneous reduction of an addition operator over ecological stencils, so this is very intensive but also highly parallel computation. In <ref> [9] </ref>, we have presented algorithms for simultaneous reduction that take advantage of associativity and commutativity of the involved binary operator (in this case, an addition). * Fractal Dimension A measure of complexity of the spatial patterns arising in the habitat. <p> Hence, the preferred parallel reduction solution, parallel prefix computation, does not solve the simultaneous reduction problem. In <ref> [9] </ref>, we presented algorithms for the simultaneous reduction problem that take advantage of associativity and commutativity of binary operators used in reduction. Additional improvement is possible if this operator also has an inverse. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms was measured on the MasPar MP-1 and reported in [6].

Reference-contexts: Fractal Dimension Fractal dimension measures the complexity of the spatial patterns generated by the simulation. It is computed using an image component analysis technique presented in <ref> [10] </ref>. Fractal dimension is the regression of the log of the perimeter on the log of the area. Suppose there are n clusters. Let cluster c i have area a i , and perimeter p i .
