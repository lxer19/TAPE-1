Title: Augmenting WordNet-like lexical resources with distributional evidence. An application-oriented perspective  
Author: Simonetta Montemagni, Vito Pirrelli 
Address: Via della Faggiola 32, Pisa, ITALY  
Affiliation: Istituto di Linguistica Computazionale, CNR  
Abstract: The paper deals with the issue of how and to what extent WordNet-like resources provide the necessary information for an assessment of semantic similarity which is useful for practical applications. The general point is made that taxonomical information should be complemented with distributional evidence. The claim is substantiated through experimental data and an illustration of a word sense disambiguation system (SENSE) capable of using contextually-relevant semantic similarity.

Reference-contexts: Distributionally-based semantic similarity A semantic similarity measure computed on the basis of distributional evidence is at work in SENSE, an example-based word sense disambiguation (WSD) system carrying out the task on the basis of a representative set of typical patterns of use <ref> (Federici et al. 1997) </ref>. In particular, SENSE presupposes prior availability of verb-noun pairs where the contextually relevant sense of the verb token is assigned. At the same time, the accompanying noun is provided with its grammatical function.

Reference-contexts: There is substantial experimental evidence supporting the view that human similarity judgements are affected by the pressure of contextual factors <ref> (see, among others, Goldstone et al. 1997) </ref>: intuitively, while candle and barbecue would score poorly on semantic proximity if considered independently of their use in context, their occurence in expressions such as light a candle, light a barbecue would immediately throw in relief a (possibly weak, but nonetheless contextually relevant) semantic

Reference-contexts: The example base used so far for testing the effectiveness of the distributionally-based semantic similarity measure for WSD purposes was automatically acquired from both semantic indicators and example sentences of the Collins Italian-English Dictionary <ref> (Montemagni 1995) </ref>. Each acquired verb-noun pair can thus be said to represent a typical pattern of use of a given sense of a verb. The choice of a bilingual dictionary was also motivated by the practical interest that the resulting sense subdivisions have for purposes of Machine Translation.

Reference-contexts: Strategies to alleviate this sparse data problem have been described for word sense disambiguation <ref> (e.g. Schtze 1992) </ref>: they define the context no longer in terms of the immediate neighbouring words, but rather as the set of words that neighbouring words normally consort with.
