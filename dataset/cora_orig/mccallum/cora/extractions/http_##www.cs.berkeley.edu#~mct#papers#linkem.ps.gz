Title: Abraham LinkEm: A User-Mode Emulator for Network Links

Abstract: Many networks that researchers study are expensive to operate or require significant overhead to do so, inhibiting rapid prototyping of research algorithms and applications. We have created a user-level network emulator that manipulates network traffic at the link level. This enables user application programs to remain unaltered and in complete ignorance of the fact they are not sending packets through a completely authentic network, but rather sending them through Abraham LinkEm. Our current implementation functions as an Ethernet bridge. LinkEms architecture makes it possible to ensure that packets flowing between machines on the two Ethernets are dropped, delayed and damaged according to network link models that researchers may create. Researchers may use LinkEm to test end-to-end algorithms that are intended for operation on networks with expensive links, like satellite or WaveLAN links, or on wide-area networks. Researchers may also implement a network link model within LinkEm, in order to see how well the model mimics the real network link.
