Title: EFFICIENT COMPUTATION OF FOURIER TRANSFORMS ON COMPACT GROUPS  
Author: DAVID K. MASLEN 
Abstract: This paper generalizes the fast Fourier transform algorithm to the computationof Fourier transforms on compact Lie groups. The basic technique uses factorization of group elements and Gel'fand-Tsetlin bases to simplify the computations, and may be extended to treat the computation of Fourier transforms of finitely supported distributions on the group. Similar transforms may be defined on homogeneous spaces; in that case we show how special function properties of spherical functions lead to more efficient algorithms. These results may all be viewed as generalizations of the fast Fourier transform algorithms on the circle, and of recent results about Fourier transforms on finite groups.

Reference-contexts: raises the possibility of using special function properties of matrix coefficients to improve our algorithms; for the groups SO (3), SU (2), and the homogeneous spaces SO (n)=SO (n 1), SU (n)=SU (n 1), Sp (n)=Sp (n 1) we may express the matrix coefficients in terms of classical orthogonal polynomials <ref> [20, 24] </ref>. In Section 8 we use the algorithm of Driscoll and Healy, for computing expansions in orthogonal polynomial sequences, to show that transforms on the above homogeneous spaces only need O (b dim G=K (log b) 2 ) operations. We shall also look at several generalizations of (1.1). <p> For non-band-limited functions we may only approximate the Fourier transforms by finite sums, and the accuracy of the approximation depends on how close the function is to being band-limited, as measured by some function-space norm. For a discussion of the non-band-limited theory and generalizations, see <ref> [24, 25] </ref>. Definition 2.2. <p> Then for any representation 2 R b , " h w b () X b = ^ h (); where h w b denotes the complex function on X b whose value at the point x is h (x) w b (x). Proof. See <ref> [24] </ref> and [25]. It is always possible to find sets X b and functions w b satisfying the conditions of Lemma 2.3. <p> When G is a Lie group we may relate the Fourier transforms of h to sums involving the values of derivatives of h as well. In the <ref> [24] </ref> and [25] it is shown how to write the Fourier transform of h as a sum of 2 n sums of the form (1.2), involving derivatives of h of order up to n. <p> It is easy to see <ref> [24] </ref> that we may choose these sets to be sets of matrix representations satisfying (R n b ) S (U n1 fiU 1 ) R b ; (R b ) SU (n) = R n and (R n b . The symplectic groups. <p> This result is not required anywhere in this paper, but it does show that the algorithms we develop may be used to compute Fourier transforms of band-limited functions. Lemma 5.4 is stated using the terminology of Section 2. A proof is given in <ref> [24] </ref> and [25] for the SO (n), SU (n) and Sp (n) cases. The U (n) case is similar. Lemma 5.4 ([24, 25]). <p> This parameterization is merely a notational convenience, and is simply related to one coming from the action of SU (n), see <ref> [24] </ref> for further explanation. <p> A n M can be written as A n v u u t 2 n1 (n 1)! j=2 6 4 (B j+1 + j 1) B j+1 k j + j 2 A j + k j 7 5 : A proof of these formulae is given in the thesis <ref> [24] </ref>; see also [20] for the unitary group case. Note that if b m n ; -n , then fi fi ~ A j (' M ) fi 1 j n, but also that k 2 maxfA 2 ; B 2 ; (A 2 + B 2 ); 0g. <p> Of course, it is nice if the sets we choose also form a system of band-limits; there are many choices that make this possible (see <ref> [24, 25] </ref>). 11.3. Multi-matrix algebras. The natural setting for the results of Sections 5-7 is the theory of multi-matrix algebras, i.e. products of complex matrix algebras. This is already clear from the definition of ^ f () X by (1.1).

The Fourier transform on a compact group The algorithms in this paper give a method for computing, approximately or exactly, the Fourier transforms of continuous functions on a compact Lie group. <p> Similarly, Sp (n 1) fi Sp (1) and Sp (n 1) fi U (1) are identified with subgroups of block diagonal quaternionic matrices in Sp (n).
