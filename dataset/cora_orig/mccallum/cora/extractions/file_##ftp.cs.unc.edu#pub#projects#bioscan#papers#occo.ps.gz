Reference-contexts: Rapid Protein Structure Classification 3 alphabetical sequence (1D structure profile) composed of these letters, where each residue is denoted by a letter. Implementation It is well known that the sensitivity and effectiveness of primary sequence comparison algorithms is determined by the quality of the score table <ref> (Altschul et al., 1994) </ref>. The score table (Table 1) for comparing the 1D structure profiles was constructed based on the analysis of correlations between OCCO angles and protein secondary structures.

Reference-contexts: In the future, we also plan to generate more sensitive score tables, based on a similar approach used in generating the BLOSUM scoring tables for primary sequence alignments <ref> (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992) </ref>. We shall further explore the underlying statistical assumptions in ranking the search results.

Reference-contexts: The ability to compare a new structure against the entire pdb in a matter of seconds shall encourage the everyday interactive use of such searches. Our preliminary data suggests that goodness-of-fit of OCCO profile is indicative of the actual 3D similarity of corresponding segments of protein structure <ref> (Hoffman et al., 1995) </ref>. Thus, it should be possible to use the reported method of 1D profile alignment for rapid multiple alignment of protein structures in order to identify the conserved structural motifs.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, this database is growing at an ever increasing rate, mirroring the earlier experiences of protein (swiss-prot) and nucleic acid (GenBank) sequence databases. Current estimates place the growth rate at one structure a day <ref> (Holm and Sander, 1994) </ref> and the rate of growth is increasing geometrically as new techniques for the interpretation of X-ray crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (nmr) data accelerate structure identification efforts.

Reference-contexts: -11 -11 -11 -11 -11 -11 -11 -11 -11 -11 2 5 8 Table 1: Table of pairwise alignment scores To test for the sensitivity of this score table, we first verified that our method can correctly register the structural dissimilarity between proteins in Jones' list of unique protein folds <ref> (Jones et al., 1992) </ref>. This list contains proteins which do not have an apparent structural similarity. Our pairwise comparisons of all proteins in the list shows that each of these unique proteins matched strongly only with itself.

Reference-contexts: The system reports all locations within database sequences which match sufficiently to a given query sequence. The statistical method used Hoffman, et al. Rapid Protein Structure Classification 2 to rank the quality of matches is based on the work of Karlin and Altschul <ref> (Karlin and Altschul, 1993) </ref>. The degree of similarity is inversely related to the sum statistics expressed as the probability of this match occurring by chance. The system scans two million database characters per second and the performance is independent of the query sequence length.

Reference-contexts: The efficiency of protein structure comparison can be greatly improved if one considers the simplified representation of protein geometry using virtual torsion angles such as C ff C ff C ff C ff ((Levitt and Warshel, 1975), (Warshel and Levitt, 1976)) or OCCO angles <ref> (Laiter et al., 1995) </ref>. In this paper, we describe a novel method for rapid comparison and classification of protein structures using the BioSCAN parallel computer and the OCCO based description of protein geometry. <p> Thus, the flexibility of protein backbone is almost entirely defined by rotations (by angles and ) around single bonds adjacent to C ff atoms. We have previously shown <ref> (Laiter et al., 1995) </ref> that the OCCO pseudodihedral angle (Figure 1), defined by the O i1 , C i1 , C i , and O i atoms (where i is the residue number), is a representative single descriptor of protein secondary structures. <p> There are two prominent peaks in the frequency distribution of OCCO angles, corresponding to the ff-helices (M through O) and the fi-sheets (X and A through E) <ref> (Laiter et al., 1995) </ref>. The core regions of each of the two peaks contain approximately one third of the observed angle data.

Reference-contexts: Hoffman, et al.

Reference-contexts: Systems and methods The BioSCAN (Biological Sequence Comparative Analysis Node) is a network accessible computational resource that performs rapid, rigorous searches of DNA, RNA, and protein sequence databases. The massively parallel computing system <ref> (Singh et al., 1993) </ref> implements a locally-optimal linear similarity measure using a programmable score table and reporting threshold in hardware. It can determine all significant alignments of two sequences, entry and query, by computing the weighted similarity in time proportional to the length of the entry sequence.

Reference-contexts: In both cases small deviations from planarity do occur. The cis form is observed in only 0.5% of all non-proline residues whereas 5.6% of prolines are found in cis conformation <ref> (Thornton, 1992) </ref>. Thus, the flexibility of protein backbone is almost entirely defined by rotations (by angles and ) around single bonds adjacent to C ff atoms.
