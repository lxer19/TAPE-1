Abstract: High-speed networks, such as ATM networks, are expected to support diverse Quality of Service (QoS) constraints, including real-time QoS guarantees. Real-time QoS is required by many applications such as those that involve voice and video communication. To support such services, routing algorithms that allow applications to reserve the needed bandwidth over a Virtual Circuit (VC) have been proposed. Commonly, these bandwidth-reservation algorithms assign VCs to routes using the least-loaded concept, and thus result in balancing the load over the set of all candidate routes. In this paper, we show that for such reservation-based protocols|which allow for the exclusive use of a preset fraction of a resource's bandwidth for an extended period of time|load balancing is not desirable as it results in resource fragmentation, which adversely affects the likelihood of accepting new reservations. In particular, we show that load-balancing VC routing algorithms are not appropriate when the main objective of the routing protocol is to increase the probability of finding routes that satisfy incoming VC requests, as opposed to equalizing the bandwidth utilization along the various routes. We present an on-line VC routing scheme that is based on the concept of "load profiling", which allows a distribution of "available" bandwidth across a set of candidate routes to match the characteristics of incoming VC QoS requests. We show the effectiveness of our load-profiling approach when compared to traditional load-balancing and load-packing VC routing schemes.

Reference-contexts: The objective of the routing algorithm is to choose routes that result in high successful VC setup rate (or equivalently, high carried VC load). 2 Routing Algorithms: Routing schemes are commonly based on the least-loaded concept (e.g., <ref> [9, 6, 5, 11, 1, 3, 14] </ref>). When a new VC arrives, it is setup on the least utilized candidate route provided it can support the VC's bandwidth requirement. Thus, the scheme attempts to evenly distribute the load among the candidate routes. We call such scheme Least Loaded Routing (LLR). <p> In both experiments, all routes were identical in terms of their capacity (total bandwidth). In our simulations, subsequent VC requests were assumed to be identically and independently distributed. In particular, VC requests were generated so as to request bandwidth uniformly from the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, where 1 indicates 100% of the total bandwidth available on a single route. For each one of these strategies, the percentage of the VC requests successfully admitted is computed.

The VC load profile may be known a priori (based on traffic forecasts) or dynamically estimated as is often done in telephone networks <ref> [3] </ref>. We found LPR competitive to the asymptotically optimal most-loaded-based routing (MLR) assuming accurate feedback information. Furthermore, LPR is less sensitive to inaccuracy in the feedback information that is inherent in a distributed network system because of its probabilistic selection of routes.

The scheme we will present in the next section does not use this information to achieve a load-balanced system.

Thus, the scheme attempts to evenly distribute the load among the candidate routes. We call such scheme Least Loaded Routing (LLR). Recently <ref> [10] </ref>, it has been recognized that in order to maximize the utilization of available resources, a routing policy in a heterogeneous (multi-rate) environment should implement packing of narrowband VCs (having relatively small bandwidth requirement) on some paths in order to leave room on other paths for wideband VCs (having relatively large <p> This packing strategy achieves two desired properties: (1) it minimizes the fragmentation of available bandwidth, which in turn results in (2) improved fairness by increasing the chances of admittance for wideband VCs. To explain these two points, consider the following example borrowed from <ref> [10] </ref>. Suppose we have two classes of VCs with bandwidth requirements b 1 = 1 and b 2 = 5 units. Suppose a class-1 VC request arrives, and that two candidate routes R 1 and R 2 are available with idle capacity of 11 and 15 units, respectively. <p> It is therefore advantageous to place this class-1 VC on R 1 , even though it is not the least-loaded route. Note that load packing results in the routes being non uniformly loaded. A routing scheme based on the packing concept was proposed in <ref> [10] </ref>. The scheme attempts to pack class-s VCs by keeping in perspective only the next higher class of VCs. In [12], we extended the scheme in order to account for all higher classes. Both schemes are, however, based on pessimistic/deterministic analysis.

Reference-contexts: Even if such reassignment is tolerable, achieving a perfect fit is known to be NP-hard. For these reasons, heuristics such as first-fit or best-fit are usually employed for on-line scheduling. Asymptotically, both the first-fit and best-fit heuristics are known to be optimal for the on-line bin packing problem <ref> [13] </ref>. However, for a small value of N |which is likely to be the case in network routing problems|best-fit outperforms first-fit.

In <ref> [18] </ref>, load balancing was found to reduce significantly the mean and standard deviation of job response times, especially under heavy or unbalanced workloads. For best-effort systems, reducing the mean and standard deviation of the metric used to gauge performance (e.g. job response times or throughput) is indicative of better performance.
