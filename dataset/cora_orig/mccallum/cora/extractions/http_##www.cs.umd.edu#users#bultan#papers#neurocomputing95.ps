Reference-contexts: In recent years, new neurocomputing approaches as maximum neural network and mean field annealing are successfully applied to several NP-hard problems such as bipartite subgraph problem [9, 14], module orientation problem [14], traveling salesperson problem [12, 15], scheduling problem [4], knapsack problem [11], mapping problem <ref> [1] </ref>, and graph partitioning problem [5, 12, 16]. In this work, mean field annealing (MFA) is formulated 1 for solving circuit partitioning problem using the net-cut model. Yih and Mazumder used the net-cut model when they applied Hopfield neural network model to the circuit partitioning problem [17]. <p> Note that, s ik 2 f0; 1g, i.e., s ik can take only two values 0 and 1, whereas v ik 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, i.e., v ik can take any real value between 0 and 1. When 8 the system is stabilized, v ik values are expected to converge to 0 or 1. <p> Another term of the energy function is the term for penalizing imbalanced partitions. We formulate this term (E B ) similar to the formulation of balance term proposed for the mapping problem <ref> [1] </ref>. E B (V) = 2 i=1 j6=i k=1 where w i and w j denote the weights of cells i and j. This triple summation term computes the summation of the inner products of the weights of the cells assigned to individual partitions. <p> For example, the complexity of computing the energy function 11 E is fi (jN jKs avg + jCj 2 K) for the proposed formulation (Eq. (8)). Here, s avg denotes the average number of cells of a net (i.e., average size of a net). We present an efficient scheme <ref> [1] </ref> which reduces the complexity of energy difference computation by asymptotical factors. The incremental energy change ffiE ik due to the incremental change ffiv ik in the value of v ik is ffiE = ffiE ik = ik ffiv ik from Eq. (9). <p> ; ik ; : : : ; iK ] t i = [ i1 ; : : : ; ik ; : : : ; iK ] t i = [ n ik ; : : : ; n The complexity of computing the i vector can be reduced asymptotically <ref> [1] </ref> if the com putation of ik in Eq.

Reference-contexts: The interconnection cost computed according to the net-cut model is 8. This encoding is similar to the encodings used for graph partitioning problem <ref> [2, 5, 12, 16] </ref> and bipartite subgraph problem [9, 14] in the previous works.

Reference-contexts: This approximation gets worse as the sizes of the nets increase [13]. Hence, treating circuit partitioning problem as graph partitioning problem can decrease the performance of the algorithm used for partitioning. Modification of the Kernighan-Lin algorithm from the graph model to the net-cut model is extensively studied <ref> [3, 13] </ref>. Since the circuit partitioning problem is NP-hard [10], finding efficient heuristics is an important research issue. <p> This increases computationally efficiency of the algorithm but decreases its flexibility since the amount of imbalance among the partitions can not be controlled. 4.3 Kernighan-Lin Implementation Kernighan-Lin (KL) heuristic is implemented efficiently as described by Fiduccia and Matthey-ses <ref> [3] </ref>. In order to apply the KL heuristic to K-way partitioning a two phase approach is used which consists of recursive bisection and pairwise min-cut phases. In recursive bisection phase, the circuit is recursively partitioned into two partitions until K partitions are obtained.

Reference-contexts: Also, divide-and-conquer algorithms, used in some VLSI layout problems as placement and floor-planning, necessitate dividing the circuits hierarchically into parts with different minimization criteria. Since the circuit partitioning is extensively used in these algorithms <ref> [10] </ref>, the problem becomes more important. A heuristic for circuit partitioning is given in the seminal paper by Kernighan and Lin [7]. In this work, the circuits are represented as graphs and the problem is treated as graph partitioning problem. <p> Hence, treating circuit partitioning problem as graph partitioning problem can decrease the performance of the algorithm used for partitioning. Modification of the Kernighan-Lin algorithm from the graph model to the net-cut model is extensively studied [3, 13]. Since the circuit partitioning problem is NP-hard <ref> [10] </ref>, finding efficient heuristics is an important research issue. <p> In general, the actual cost contribution of a unit weight net across a cut of a bipartitioning is 1, but the cost contribution of a clique, which is evenly split across a cut, rises quadratically with the size of the clique <ref> [10] </ref>. This quadratic growth does not adequately reflect the costs arising in practice. In fact, heuristics using the graph model for representing circuits will try to remove all nets with large sizes from the cut-set and try to put the smaller ones. <p> It can be 5 argued that some other representation scheme can be used to represent circuits with graphs which can give better approximations to the actual cost, but it can be shown that there is no good way of mapping a circuit instance into a graph <ref> [10] </ref>. 3 Applying MFA to the Circuit Partitioning Problem Mean field annealing (MFA) merges collective computation and annealing properties of Hopfield neural networks [6] and simulated annealing [8], respectively, to obtain a general algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems.

After the spin averages (v ik values) and the parameters T 0 and r are initialized, the cooling schedule of the algorithm proceeds as follows. At each temperature a random sequence is generated for the spins that are not converged yet. <p> Acceptance probabilities of the moves that increase the cost are controlled with a temperature parameter T which is decreased using an annealing schedule. Hence, as the annealing proceeds acceptance probabilities of uphill moves decrease. An automatic cooling schedule is used in the implementation of the SA algorithm <ref> [12] </ref>. Note that, the SA algorithm implemented in this work implicitly achieves the balance among the sizes of the partitions by selecting the neighbor configurations as defined above.

Reference-contexts: In this work, mean field annealing (MFA) is formulated 1 for solving circuit partitioning problem using the net-cut model. Yih and Mazumder used the net-cut model when they applied Hopfield neural network model to the circuit partitioning problem <ref> [17] </ref>. MFA combines the collective computation property of Hopfield neural network model [6] with the annealing notion of simulated annealing [8] in order to form a better algorithm [15]. In MFA, discrete variables called spins (or neurons) are used for encoding the combinatorial optimization problems.
