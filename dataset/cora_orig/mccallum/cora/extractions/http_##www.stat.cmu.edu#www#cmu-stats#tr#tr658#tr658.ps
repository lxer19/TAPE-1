Reference-contexts: When making inferences on fi and , the MCMC output for W is simply ignored. Albert (1992) and succeeding investigators apply this strategy to the normal ogive model, where W represents the vector of continuous, normally MCMC for IRT 9 distributed variables underlying the observed discrete responses <ref> (as in, for example, Bartholomew, 1987, Chapter 5) </ref>. 3.5 Rejection sampling within Gibbs Precalculation of the normalizing constants in (3) may be avoided completely by performing draws using rejection sampling (Ripley, 1987, Ch. 3).

Reference-contexts: The present paper demonstrates an MCMC technique that is easier to implement for novel models than those surveyed above, and hence may be particularly well-suited for research in more complex IRT models. Our methods are based on Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs <ref> (Chib and Greenberg, 1995) </ref> sampling. In Section 2 we briefly review the IRT model, and in Section 3 we review standard Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings sampling methods as they apply to IRT models. Section 4 discusses some methods of tuning Metropolis-Hastings to speed convergence. <p> While convenient for illustration of the algorithms, the full parameter vectors and fi are too highly multivariate to be useful for practical IRT work. In MCMC we are free to group parameters into whatever blocks are convenient to work with <ref> (Chib and Greenberg, 1995) </ref>. An advantage of choosing relatively large blocks of parameters is that it can be more efficient to simulate blocks of random variates that have correlation structure like the inverse Fisher information of the estimated parameters.

Reference-contexts: Then we can estimate the posterior mean as the sample mean of these batch means, with MC SE given by the usual sample SE of the batch means, and so forth. Precise tests of Markov chain stationarity are available <ref> (see for example Cowles and Carlin, 1995) </ref>, as are more sophisticated estimates of Monte Carlo standard errors (see for example Gelman and Rubin, 1992; Gelman et al., 1995, Chapter 11; and Geyer, 1992).

Reference-contexts: Cowles and Carlin (1995) survey current research in this area, and provide useful diagnostic software. An approach <ref> (Gelman and Rubin, 1992) </ref> that is often successful is to imitate what is done with E-M and Newton-Raphson algorithms: start several chains at several well-separated sets of "initial values" and compare the results after many iterations. <p> MCMC for IRT 22 7,400. of iterations, and we found this to be approximately true in this case (by examining Figures 1 and 4 for example). To investigate stationarity more carefully and to address the Monte Carlo standard error, we examine both several independent replications of the Markov chain <ref> (a strategy recommended by Gelman and Rubin, 1992) </ref> and also a single long realization of the Markov chain (a strategy recommended by Geyer, 1992).

Reference-contexts: The cost of this ease of implementation is generally slower execution times for estimation algorithms. Gelfand and Smith (1990) popularized a version of MCMC called Gibbs sampling <ref> (Geman and Geman, 1984) </ref>. Gibbs sampling works best when one can obtain closed-form expressions for all of the so-called "complete conditional" distributions (Section 3.3 below) associated with a particular multivariate posterior distribution.

Reference-contexts: If the results agree, this is evidence that all the chains have converged to the same stationary distribution; if not, we must run the chains longer or examine for errors the computer program implementing the MCMC for IRT 15 chains. An alternate approach <ref> (Geyer, 1992) </ref> using one very long chain is more efficient in using the simulation output, but leads to more complex Monte Carlo standard error expressions, for example. <p> To investigate stationarity more carefully and to address the Monte Carlo standard error, we examine both several independent replications of the Markov chain (a strategy recommended by Gelman and Rubin, 1992) and also a single long realization of the Markov chain <ref> (a strategy recommended by Geyer, 1992) </ref>. The short chains were 7,400 steps long, with the first 400 observations taken to be burn-in, and the long chain was 37,000 steps long, with the first 2,000 observations taken to be burn-in. Tables 3 and 4 summarize the results of our replications. <p> The posterior mean and standard deviation are estimated by the sample mean and sample standard deviation of the realizations in the chain. These estimators are unbiased and consistent for the mean and standard deviation of the stationary distribution of the chain, assuming stationarity has been achieved <ref> (Geyer, 1992) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: If the target densities are log-concave, efficient choices for q can be made automatically <ref> (Gilks, 1992) </ref>; this is the method implemented in the BUGS software of Spiegelhalter, Thomas, Best, and Gilks (1996). 3.6 Metropolis-Hastings algorithm A Markov chain based on rejection sampling may also be constructed directly, following Metropolis et al. (1953) and Hastings (1970).

As the situations in which IRT is applied become more complex, so too become the models. For example, data from large-scale educational assessment surveys include item responses obtained from complex sampling designs for subjects (examinees) and measures (items).

Reference-contexts: Conceptually, setting up an MCMC algorithm for a model is similar to setting up an E-M algorithm <ref> (see for example Rubin, 1991) </ref>, but since MCMC does not involve exact MCMC for IRT 3 numerical quadrature (for the E-step) or pre-calculation of derivatives (for the M step), MCMC is generally easier to implement. The cost of this ease of implementation is generally slower execution times for estimation algorithms.

Reference-contexts: It is often convenient to combine these strategies; the result will still have stationary distribution <ref> (Tierney, 1994) </ref>. In this algorithm, called Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs, we iteratively sample from the complete conditionals according to the Gibbs algorithm, but for complete conditionals whose form is known only up to a normalizing constant, we use a single iteration of the M-H algorithm. <p> again ff simplifies due to extensive cancellation made possible by the conditional independence assumptions entailed by (1), the assumption of prior independence, and symmetry of q fi . 4.2 Choosing proposal densities q and q fi There is much flexibility in choosing the proposal densities q for M-H within Gibbs <ref> (e.g., Tierney, 1994) </ref>, but two methods are in common use. In random-walk Metropolis-Hastings we generate candidates from a symmetric distribution centered at the current parameter state.
