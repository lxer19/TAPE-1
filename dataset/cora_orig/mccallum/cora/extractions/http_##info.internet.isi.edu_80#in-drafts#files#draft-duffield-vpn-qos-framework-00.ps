Reference-contexts: In this draft we develop a framework for providing Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees in VPN and address some of the issues in managing group security. Other VPN drafts have focussed on other issues, especially those related to routing <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. The rest of the draft is organized as follows. In Section 3, we briefly present the different models of VPN. We then present our framework for QoS in VPNs in Section 4. 3. VPN Connectivity Models There are several models of VPN. <p> Other VPNs may not care if an entity that was initially member of the VPN but has subsequently dropped off, is able to decrypt the group's communications. Such policies should be configurable for each VPN. 6.1. Security Model in the Context of Hoses The draft <ref> [1] </ref> discusses various aspects of security for a VPN. IPSec is recommended for securing the packets flowing between the edges. However, most of the mechanisms described assume edge to edge model for security. A limitation of using IPSec in the edge to edge model is its scalability.

VPN Connectivity Models There are several models of VPN. <p> Figure 1 (a) shows a dedicated network and Figure 1 (b) shows a virtual network that emulates it using Virtual Private Links. The virtual links can originate and terminate at customer edge routers. Alternatively, by employing virtual software routers <ref> [2] </ref>, the virtual links can originate and terminate at provider edge routers. This model does not require any modification to the routing protocols. Each VPN runs an instance of a routing protocol. The routing protocols employed by each VPN can be different.

Reference-contexts: This is a model that may be suitable when implementing hoses within the MPLS framework. 5.1. Implementing Hoses in an Integrated Services Framework One possible way of providing Quality of Service for flows belonging to a VPN is using the IntServ framework of services. Either the Guaranteed Service <ref> [5] </ref> or Controlled Load Service [6] could be used to provide the resource management needed for a given VPN, based on the level of commitment desired for the VPN. We assume that the connectivity for the purposes of this discussion exists between all the hose points of the VPN.

Reference-contexts: The diff-serv model assumes that scheduling decisions at routers are based on the value of the DS byte of the IP header <ref> [7] </ref>. The diff-serv working group is standardizing on a small set of DS values that imply a particular per-hop (packet handling) behavior (PHB) [8]. For example, packets marked as requiring Expedited Forwarding (EF) PHB will be forwarded with very little queueing delay at intermediate routers.
