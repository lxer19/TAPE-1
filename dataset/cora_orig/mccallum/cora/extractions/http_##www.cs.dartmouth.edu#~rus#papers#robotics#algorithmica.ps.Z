Title: Coordinated Manipulation of Objects in a Plane  
Author: Daniela Rus

Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Dartmouth College  
Abstract: The ability to manipulate objects is a basic and necessary function of autonomous robots that can perform manufacturing tasks. We present an efficient algorithm for the coordinated manipulation of objects in a plane by independent robot agents and an efficient decision procedure for whether an object can undergo any desired reorientation or not. This algorithm has good stability properties, in that it is not sensitive to small errors in the initial data and it relies on a simple control scheme. Our result is a contribution towards realistic task-level planning for manufacturing.

Reference-contexts: This causes the polygon to rotate. Since we wish to do this while maintaining a grasp, the amount of rotation accomplished in a one-step reorientation is limited. To determine the completion of a one-step motion we are inspired by <ref> [LMT] </ref> and introduce a completion condition, called the termination predicate. The total amount of reorientation can be increased by alternating the tracking agent, effectively composing one-step motions. The approach of this paper is to show that there is a robust 2 counterclockwise. <p> Much relevant work has been done in general motion planning, grasp planning, and manipulation planning.

Reference-contexts: This is called the reorientation task. Figure 2 depicts one robot executing this task. A robot can generate a rotation by applying a force that is displaced from the center of friction. This property relates the dynamics and geometry of rotations <ref> [Mas1] </ref> and it can be used to effect continuous reorientations. The idea is to compliantly apply a sliding force on the face of the object. <p> Then by <ref> [Mas1, Rus3] </ref> the object rotates until the forces become concurrent. This convergence minimizes the energy of the system measured by the area of the triangle determined by the intersection of the three force directions.

Three frictionless contacts are sufficient for obtaining force-direction closure grasps of planar objects. This should be contrasted with the more general case of force-closure grasps, for which any force or torque can be resisted by the grasping agents. <p> V can be calculated efficiently, as shown in <ref> [Ngu] </ref>. Vertex (e i ; e j ; e k ) is connected with an edge to all vertices of the form (e j ; e k ; e l ). The initialization step picks a first grasping edge set.

Reference-contexts: We assume that the objects have polygonal cross-sections with known geometry and that the interaction between the object and the agents is through frictionless point contacts. Extension to polyhedra and point contacts with friction are given in <ref> [Rus4] </ref>. Our strategy for reorientations is called tracking. The basic idea is depicted in Figure 1. Three agents cooperate to reorient a box by sliding on the surface of the box while exerting forces. <p> Grasp planning algorithms that treat uncertainty include [Bro2, Gol].

The sequential algorithm presented in this paper has been parallelized. <p> Since the displacement of the center of grip is caused by the force exerted by the tracking agent, the extreme points correspond to places where the sign on the virtual work 4 of the force changes <ref> [Rus4] </ref>. Intuitively, this means that in order to continue motion, the "pushing" force must change into a "pulling" force. Figure 8 shows a blocked triangle. We call the condition of Proposition 3.1 the blocking condition.
