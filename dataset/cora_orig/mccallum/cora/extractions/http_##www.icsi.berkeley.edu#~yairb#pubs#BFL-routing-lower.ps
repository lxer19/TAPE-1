Abstract: We present lower bounds on the competitive ratio of randomized algorithms for a wide class of on-line graph optimization problems and we apply such results to on-line virtual circuit and optical routing problems. Lund and Yannakakis [LY93a] give inapproximability results for the problem of finding the largest vertex induced subgraph satisfying any non-trivial, hereditary, property . E.g., independent set, planar, acyclic, bipartite, etc. We consider the on-line version of this family of problems, where some graph G is fixed and some subgraph H is presented on-line, vertex by vertex. The on-line algorithm must choose a subset of the vertices of H, choosing or rejecting a vertex when it is presented, whose vertex induced subgraph satisfies property . Furthermore, we study the on-line version of graph coloring whose off-line version has also been shown to be inapproximable [LY93b], on-line max edge-disjoint paths and on-line path coloring problems. Irrespective of the time complexity, we show an (n * ) lower bound on the competitive ratio of randomized on-line algorithms for any of these problems. x International Computer Science Institute (Berkeley) & Dipartimento di Informatica e Sistemistica, Universita di Roma "La Sapienza".

Vertices v 2 V are presented one by one. The adversary may choose to stop the sequence at any time. The on-line algorithm has to decide if to accept v or not. <p> The complementary property is also a non-trivial hereditary property. Ramsey's theorem implies that any non-trivial hereditary property is satisfied by all independent sets or by all cliques <ref> [LY93a] </ref>. Thus, without loss of generality, we thereafter restrict attention to hereditary non-trivial graph properties that are satisfied for all independent sets.
