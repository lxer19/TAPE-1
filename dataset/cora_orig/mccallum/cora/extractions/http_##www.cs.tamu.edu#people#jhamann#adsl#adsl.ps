Reference-contexts: The original intention of the unshielded twisted-pair circuit was to transmit one analog voice channel, ranging from 300 Hz to 3400 Hz, over copper or aluminum wire, ranging in gauge and diameter. A subscriber loop's line attenuation may well vary from link to link <ref> [1] </ref>. Modems allow customers to convert their computer's data stream into an analog format and transmit that data over their POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) line, and with recent advances in modulation and compression, some modems now claim a 28.8 kb/s throughput over a standard POTS circuit. <p> (Unshielded Twisted Pair) for frequencies up to 1 MHz (the upper limits of the ADSL spectrum)<ref> [1] </ref>. Attenuation is high for most of the ADSL spectrum, but the characteristic is fairly linear and easily equalized. More importantly, the group delay is practically constant so that any pulse distortion will be small [1]. The downstream (high capacity) data rate is largely dependent on the length of the subscriber line from the central office and the gauge of the twisted pair cable. <p> Richard Karpinski outlines the length and gauge requirements in Table 1 [4]. 6 2.3 ADSL Channel Configurations Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) is used for ADSL over a 1 MHz spectrum. Figure 2 illustrates the general allocation of the frequency spectrum above the voice band <ref> [1] </ref>. Besides the 0-3.4 MHz band of voice communications, ADSL provides for a low speed upstream channel (from subscriber to central office) and a high speed downstream channel (from central office to subscriber). <p> ADSL can provide VCR-type functionality, like fast forward, rewind, freeze frame, pause, etc. on demand <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) The binary data stream is split into two sub-streams and separately modulated onto orthogonal versions of the same carrier frequency. The two modulated signals are then added and low pass filtered before transmission to the network <ref> [1] </ref>. This is the least used modulation technique for ADSL. 10 Carrierless Amplitude-Phase Modulation (CAP) Developed by AT&T Paradyne, CAP ADSL equipment is available as an alternative to the industry standard DMT. <p> The transfer functions of the two filters have the same amplitude characteristics, but the phase characteristics differ by 90 degrees [6]. The outputs are added, passed through a digital-to-analog converter and filtered before being sent to the transmission network <ref> [1] </ref>. Data encoded using CAP has the same spectral characteristics and provides the same theoretical performance as QAM, but does so without a carrier frequency. Eliminating carrier modulation (mixing) provides two key advantages. <p> This converts the frequency domain samples into time domain values with a sliding time-window effect. These values are then transcoded into a serial format and converted from digital to analog before transmission through the ADSL circuit <ref> [1] </ref>. Some of the most important parameters for standardized ADSL DMT are described below [5]. Pilot Carrier 64 (f=276 kHz) is reserved for a pilot. The data modulated onto the pilot subcarrier shall be constant 0,0. Use of this pilot allows resolution of sample timing in a receiver modulo-8 samples.

Reference-contexts: 1.4 Use the Existing Copper Pair Why not take full advantage of the copper pair already installed to the customer's premises? With more than 800 million twisted pair copper telephone lines deployed worldwide, Local Exchange Carriers (LEC's) have a tremendous incentive to leverage this substantial asset against their new competitors <ref> [2] </ref>. Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line, or ADSL, allows LEC's to use existing copper plant in offering new bandwidth-intensive services. <p> The ATU-C transmits high-speed simplex channels downstream, and sends and receives lower-speed duplex channels. The ATU-C units may either be standalone, or mounted with others in an equipment shelf. In the future, the ATU-C will be integrated into access nodes and remote access nodes <ref> [2] </ref>. The ATU-C is paired with its mirror image, an ADSL remote terminal unit (ATU-R). The ATU-R is generally a standalone device, and receives downstream data and transceives corresponding duplex data [2]. <p> In the future, the ATU-C will be integrated into access nodes and remote access nodes <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line, or ADSL, allows LEC's to use existing copper plant in offering new bandwidth-intensive services. An ADSL modem is placed on each end of the loop to create a high speed link using the existing telephone network <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 2 ADSL The idea for ADSL was spawned by Joe Lechleider, a Bellcore researcher, in the late 1980's. It was a natural extension of the digital subscriber line (DSL) access technology developed for Basic Rate Interface (BRI) ISDN. ANSI has assigned the number "T1.413" to the ADSL standard [3]. <p> <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 2 ADSL The idea for ADSL was spawned by Joe Lechleider, a Bellcore researcher, in the late 1980's.

ANSI has assigned the number "T1.413" to the ADSL standard [3]. 2.1 An ADSL Network Architecture Using the existing subscriber line already installed from the central office to the customer's premises, two ADSL devices are connected to both ends of the local loop. The ADSL functions at the central office are handled by the ATU-C (ADSL Terminal Unit). <p> DS1 T-Carrier) could tamper with spectral compatibility and mutual crosstalk with ADSL systems. Analysis of the interaction between ADSL and DS1 T-Carrier resulted in specific deployment guidelines depending on whether T-Carrier was present and whether the two systems shared the same binder group <ref> [3] </ref>. Impulse Noise While impulse noise has not appeared to be a significant performance impairment for DSL, HDSL, or T1 systems, data indicated that impulse levels were on the same order as ADSL signals and the spectra overlapped. <p> ADSL system designs include forward error correction and coding schemes to counteract the burst error effects of noise impulses <ref> [3] </ref>. 9 Radio Frequency Interference While not expressed in the ADSL stan-dard, there exists potential radio frequency interference from ADSL signal radiation leakage from the loop and inside wiring. Additionally, the AM broadcast band overlaps the ADSL frequency spectrum. <p> Additionally, the AM broadcast band overlaps the ADSL frequency spectrum. It appears that as long as accepted practices for maintaining electrical balance between each of the two loop conductors, and the connecting circuitry and the external environment are followed, there should be minimum concern for radio frequency interference <ref> [3] </ref>. 2.5 Modulation While the ADSL standard specifies only one type of modulation, researchers have tested and implemented three different modulation techniques for use with ADSL: Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), Carrierless Amplitude-Phase Modulation (CAP), and Discrete Multi-Tone Modulation (DMT). <p> A new organization, the ADSL Forum, 13 was formed to deal with market and technical issues for ADSL system de-ployment. The ADSL Forum has patterned itself after the ATM Forum, and plans to push forward on all aspects of ADSL deployment, from Marketing/Services/Educational to Technical issues <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 Current ADSL Projects ADSL is not readily available in any U.S. market as of late 1996. The ADSL Forum has noted that many telephone companies have expressed their intention to offer ADSL services for Internet access and other packet-based communications applications in 1997.

Reference-contexts: Hybrid Fiber-Coax (HFC) require large scale upgrades and depend on break-even points and a minimum number of subscribers within a geographic area, ADSL costs the same for every subscriber. "Serving the first home costs no more than serving the 500th home," says Bill Rodey, director of marketing at Westell Corp <ref> [4] </ref>. There are no large "one-time" costs associated with major upgrades of wireline facilities. * If another technology appears in a few years and some ADSL subscribers abandon their ADSL service, the service provider can recover their ADSL equipment and reuse them on future ADSL customers. <p> The downstream (high capacity) data rate is largely dependent on the length of the subscriber line from the central office and the gauge of the twisted pair cable. Richard Karpinski outlines the length and gauge requirements in Table 1 <ref> [4] </ref>. 6 2.3 ADSL Channel Configurations Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) is used for ADSL over a 1 MHz spectrum.

ADSL can provide VCR-type functionality, like fast forward, rewind, freeze frame, pause, etc. on demand [1].
