Reference-contexts: Traditional FEC permits encoding only on a single priority level. An Adaptable Forward Error Correction (AdFEC) scheme has been proposed [LaEf93], capable of assigning different priority levels to different groups of packets. The more important the group of packets, the more redundancy is devoted. Priority Encoding Transmission (PET) <ref> [AlLu94] </ref> is a new approach regarding the prioritized transmission of scalable messages over lossy packet-switched networks. It allows a user to specify priorities for different segments of data. Based on this hierarchical structure the sender uses the system to encode the data into packets for transmission. <p> We describe a way of packetizing MPEG-1 bitstreams. The basic idea is that inter-frames are less redundantly encoded than reference frames. We introduce a PET-MPEG-1 simulation and describe observed results with different MPEG sequences. - 5 - 2 Priority Encoding Transmission (PET) Priority Encoding Transmission (PET) <ref> [AlLu94] </ref> is a new approach introducing a method for sending messages over a lossy packet-switched network according to a user specified prioritization scheme. It focuses on fault tolerant transmission, especially suitable in case of unpredictable packet losses. Its design is independent from any specific scalable application. <p> B I MPEG Group of Pictures MPEG-1 Video Compression - 18 - I B B P B B P B B I B B P B B I B B P Bitstream Order Display Order - 19 - 4 Prioritized Encoding of MPEG Sequences 4.1 Motivation Priority Encoding Transmission (PET) <ref> [AlLu94] </ref> is designed to be an independent interface between a packet-switched network and any scalable application. The latter has to provide a priority scheme according to which PET is able to assign redundancy.

Reference-contexts: Intentionally it was designed for storage on digital storage media such as CD-ROM and DAT which are perfectly suited for bit-rates of 1 to 1.5 Mbits/sec. Its development therefore addressed the following features <ref> [Gall91] </ref>: l Random Access l Fast Forward/Reverse Searches l Reverse Playback l Audio-Visual Synchronization l Editability l Format Flexibility Image compression usually is achieved by applying several techniques such as subsampling of chrominance components, quantization, frequency transformation by cosine transform (DCT) and variable length coding (VLC)[PeMi93].

Reference-contexts: of or elements, which in the latter case can be considered as polynomials of degree m-1 with coefficients : In Galois field GF [p] operations are calculated modulo p, whereas in Galois field GF [ ] an irreducible polynomial p (x) is needed, so calculation is done modulo p (x) <ref> [Ha93] </ref>. The arithmetic in extension fields is more complicated than in prime fields.

Reference-contexts: However the standard is not limited to this benchmark and may be used at higher data rates <ref> [ISO11172] </ref>. Intentionally it was designed for storage on digital storage media such as CD-ROM and DAT which are perfectly suited for bit-rates of 1 to 1.5 Mbits/sec. <p> Since they are independent, they may be coded in groups. A slice may be a single line of the image or consists of any number of macroblocks. Each of them contains a header and six component blocks <ref> [ISO11172] </ref>: Due to the characteristics of sensitiveness of the human eye, color information is subsampled [PaSm93,PeMi93]. That is, a macroblock of 16x16 pixels represents four blocks of luminance Y, but only one block of chrominance blue Cb and one of chrominance red Cr. <p> Bidirectional frames therefore provide the highest amount of compression, but may not be suitable for all applications, since they require out of sequence transmission which leads to latency <ref> [ISO11172] </ref>. the feedback loop is only needed for P- and B-frames. RGB DCT Q + Intraframe mode Interframe mode DCT Q motion vectors + - error terms Frame memory MPEG-1 Video Compression - 16 - 3.3 Bitstream Hierarchy An MPEG video is represented by a layered bitstream. <p> A GOP provides random access, since it is the smallest coding unit which under certain circumstances can be independently decoded. Due to the variety of picture types, the design of a GOP is constrained by the following properties <ref> [ISO11172] </ref>: l Property 1. A group of pictures, in bitstream order must start with an I-frame and may be followed by any number of I-,P- or B-frames in any order. l Property 2. <p> The MPEG standard provides a closed GOP ag. It denotes whether the GOP is open or closed. In the latter case a GOP can be decoded without any references to previous groups <ref> [ISO11172] </ref>. With respect to the transmission of MPEG sequences over packet-switched networks, the closed GOP ag could slightly increase the fault tolerance of the bitstream. temporal references which denote the display order. In general bidirectional frames change places with reference frames. <p> 1 macroblock_type 010 motion_horizontal_backward_code 1 motion_vertical_backward_code 1 Macroblock Layer Slice Layer Macroblock Layer slice_start_code 0000 0102 VLC Prioritized Encoding of MPEG Sequences - 38 - Note that on the macroblock layer values are variable length coded and therefore have to be looked up in special tables defined in the standard <ref> [ISO11172] </ref>. As macroblock_type the macroblock_motion_backward pattern was selected, since the goal was to copy the previous reference frame. Accordingly the motion codes are set to zero, since no motion vectors appear in the bitstream. These bit patterns are then byte aligned and repeatingly inserted until the whole image is created.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the primary use of FEC by the application would be to recover lost packets [LaEf93,Sha92]. Traditional FEC permits encoding only on a single priority level. An Adaptable Forward Error Correction (AdFEC) scheme has been proposed <ref> [LaEf93] </ref>, capable of assigning different priority levels to different groups of packets. The more important the group of packets, the more redundancy is devoted. Priority Encoding Transmission (PET) [AlLu94] is a new approach regarding the prioritized transmission of scalable messages over lossy packet-switched networks.

Reference-contexts: MPEG-2 by definition is forward compatible with MPEG-1. Consequently the player could also be used for decoding MPEG-1 bitstreams. In our simulation we decided to use this player to decode MPEG-1 sequences. The development focussed on an implementation close to the standard <ref> [MP2/94] </ref>. Therefore the performance of its decoding routines might be slightly worse than in the case of the Berkeley player, but it turned out to be much more fault tolerant. Additionally it provides frame rate control.
