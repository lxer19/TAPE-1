Reference-contexts: Below is an incomplete summary of school regulations. Students are required to read the GSAS General Announcement Bulletin (see <ref> [1] </ref>) for a more complete discussion. 10.1 Registration A student must be registered at all times. The registration procedures and categories are somewhat complicated.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, it is common in our department to include one or two experts from outside the University. Procedures for submission and defense of a dissertation are quite formal; the student should study the document The Ph.D. Dissertation: Research Proposal, Sponsorship, and Defense (see <ref> [2] </ref>). 9 Evaluation of Progress: The Bi-Annual Review. Near the end of each semester the faculty meets to review the progress of each Ph.D. student. This review generally takes place on a "University Study Day" just before finals.
Reference: [3] <institution> GSAS Report on Progress in Candidacy in the Doctoral Program, </institution> <note> due by May 15 each year after the M.Phil. </note>
Reference-contexts: To receive the M.Phil. degree, the student must Ph.D. pass all four qualifiers and satisfy the teaching requirement. It is the student's responsibility to apply for his/her degrees in a timely manner. Also, students who have an M.Phil. must submit a yearly progress report to GSAS (see <ref> [3] </ref>). 10.3 Time Limits GSAS time limits are: * The M.Phil. must be obtained within three years. * The Ph.D. must be obtained within six years. * The dissertation proposal must be submitted within six months of com pletion of the M.Phil.
Reference: [4] <institution> The department's Guidelines for PhD Teaching Assistants, </institution> <note> located online in the file /misc/info/phd/phdta-guidelines.ps </note>
Reference-contexts: Petitions to teach may be denied for various reasons, including insufficient evidence of the student's likely competence as an instructor, or department or University policy constraining the use of student instructors. Before the first TA assignment, the student should study the document Guidelines for PhD Teaching Assistants (see <ref> [4] </ref>). 8 The Dissertation The dissertation must describe a piece of original research and must describe it in a scholarly fashion.
Reference: [5] <institution> The syllabi for qualifiers, </institution> <note> located on-line in the directories /misc/info/syllabus/*. 13 </note>
Reference-contexts: Each of the following areas is covered by an examination given every semester, near the end of a semester: * Theoretical Computer Science * Software Systems * Artificial Intelligence * Computer Systems The qualifiers conform to syllabi (see <ref> [5] </ref> for where to get a copy) published in each area by a committee of faculty. <p> A list of course substitutions for each exam is published as part of the syllabi on which the associated examination is based (see <ref> [5] </ref>). (There is no explicit linkage between courses and areas of the syllabus; however, in practice there is a relatively faithful one-to-one mapping.) Up to four courses may be required, and the student may be offered some choice from a larger list of courses.
