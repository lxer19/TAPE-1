Abstract: Routing mail through a heterogeneous internet presents many new problems. Among the worst of these is that of address mapping. Historically, this has been handled on an ad hoc basis. However, this approach has become unmanageable as internets grow. Sendmail will replace delivermail in the Berkeley 4.2 distribution. Several major hosts are now or will soon be running sendmail. This change will affect any users that route mail through a sendmail gateway. The changes that will be user visible are emphasized. The mail system to appear in 4.2bsd will contain a number of changes. Most of these changes are based on the replacement of delivermail with a new module called sendmail. Sendmail implements a general internetwork mail routing facility, featuring aliasing and forwarding, automatic routing to network gateways, and exible configuration. Of key interest to the mail system user will be the changes in the network addressing structure. In a simple network, each node has an address, and resources can be identified with a host-resource pair; in particular, the mail system can refer to users using a host-username pair. Host names and numbers have to be administered by a central authority, but usernames can be assigned locally to each host. In an internet, multiple networks with different characteristics and managements must communicate. In particular, the syntax and semantics of resource identification change. Certain special cases can be handled trivially by ad hoc techniques, such as providing network names that appear local to hosts on other networks, as with the Ethernet at Xerox PARC. However, the general case is extremely complex. For example, some networks require that the route the message takes be explicitly specified by the sender, simplifying the database update problem since only adjacent hosts must be entered into the system tables, while others use logical addressing, where the sender specifies the location of the recipient but not how to get there. Some networks use a left-associative syntax and others use a right-associative syntax, causing

Reference-contexts: Version 8.2 USENIX - Jan 83 Last Mod 11/27/93 Mail Systems and Addressing in 4.2bsd 6 Forwarding also permits a user to specify a private incoming mailer. For example, for warding to: "| /usr/local/newmail myname" will use a different incoming mailer. 3.3.3. Inclusion Inclusion is specified in RFC 733 <ref> [Crocker77] </ref> syntax: :Include: pathname An address of this form reads the file specified by pathname and sends to all users listed in that file. The intent is not to support direct use of this feature, but rather to use this as a subset of aliasing.

Reference-contexts: The UUCP network is an example of such a network. 2. DESIGN GOALS Design goals for sendmail 1 include: (1) Compatibility with the existing mail programs, including Bell version 6 mail, Bell version 7 mail, Berkeley Mail [Shoens79], BerkNet mail [Schmidt79], and hopefully UUCP mail [Nowitz78]. ARPANET mail <ref> [Crocker82] </ref> was also required. (2) Reliability, in the sense of guaranteeing that every message is correctly delivered or at least brought to the attention of a human for correct disposal; no message should ever be completely lost. <p> USAGE 3.1. Address Formats Arguments may be ags or addresses. Flags set various processing options. Following ag arguments, address arguments may be given. Addresses follow the syntax in RFC822 <ref> [Crocker82] </ref> for ARPANET address formats. In brief, the format is: (1) Anything in parentheses is thrown away (as a comment). (2) Anything in angle brackets (&lt; &gt;) is preferred over anything else.

Reference-contexts: For example, a person at MIT and a person at USC could both send to eric@Berkeley.ARPA and have it arrive to the same mailbox. Ideally a white pages service would be provided to map user identifications into addresses (for example, see <ref> [Solomon81] </ref>). Currently this is handled by passing around scraps of paper or by calling people on the telephone to find out their address. 1.3. Route While an address specifies where to find a mailbox, a route specifies how to find the mailbox.

Reference-contexts: Parentheses, angle brackets, and double quotes must be properly balanced and nested. The rewriting rules control remaining parsing 2 . Although old style addresses are still accepted in most cases, the preferred address format is based on ARPANET-style domain-based addresses <ref> [Su82a] </ref>. These addresses are based on a hierarchical, logical decomposition of the address space. The addresses are hierarchical in a sense similar to the U.S. postal addresses: the messages may first be routed to the correct state, with no initial consideration of the city or other addressing details.

Reference-contexts: Thus as new hosts are added only one host (the domain master) must be updated immediately; other hosts can be updated as convenient. Ideally this name resolution process would be performed by a name server (e.g., <ref> [Su82b] </ref>) to avoid unnecessary copying of the message. However, in a b atch network such as UUCP this could result in unnecessary delays. 5. COMPARISON WITH DELIVERMAIL Sendmail is an outgrowth of delivermail. The primary differences are: (1) Configuration information is not compiled in.
