Abstract: We study the area requirement for upward straight-line grid drawing of complete and Fibonacci tree. We prove that a complete tree with n nodes can be drawn in n + O(log n n) area, and a Fibonacci tree with n nodes can be drawn in 1:17n +

Reference-contexts: Many refer ences about upward drawing of arbitrary graphs can be found in the annotated bibliography maintained by Di Battista, Eades and Tamassia <ref> [1] </ref>. Upward drawings have applications in program animation and in data structure visualization, and, more generally, are a convenient representation of hierarchical structures.

Reference-contexts: Piperno showed that every binary tree admits an upward drawing into a grid of area O (n log n), where n is the number of nodes, and that this bound is optimal within a constant factor because an infinite family of binary trees exists that require area (n log n) <ref> [2] </ref>. Moreover, they also show that both complete and Fibonacci trees can be drawn in linear area. In order to achieve this latter result, they introduce the notion of h-v drawing. <p> Moreover, a straightforward application of the same idea yields an algorithm that draw a Fibonacci tree with n nodes into a grid of area 1:171n + O (log n p n), thus improving over the area requirement of <ref> [2] </ref> (that is about 6n). 1.1 Preliminaries We denote by e the empty tree and by 1 the tree consisting of a single node.

Reference-contexts: Successively, Crescenzi and Piperno presented an algorithm that finds a linear area upward drawing for any AVL tree, again using the notion of h-v drawing <ref> [3] </ref>. It is also interesting to note that minimum area h-v drawings can be found for any binary tree in polynomial time [4].

In a related paper, Garg, Goodrich, and Tamassia proved that any binary tree can be drawn in linear area, provided that we slightly relax both the upward and the straight-line conditions [6].

Reference-contexts: In a related paper, Garg, Goodrich, and Tamassia proved that any binary tree can be drawn in linear area, provided that we slightly relax both the upward and the straight-line conditions <ref> [6] </ref>. In this paper we present a new algorithm that draws a complete binary tree with n nodes into a grid of area n + O (log n p n), so that, asymptotically, all the points of the grid hold a node, but a negligible ratio.

Reference-contexts: For any h 0, c h denotes the complete binary tree of height h, and F h denotes the Fibonacci tree of height h <ref> [8] </ref>. We recall that the inductive definition of F h is the following: F 0 = 1, F 1 = e 1, F i = F i2 F i1 for i &gt; 1.

Reference-contexts: We conjecture that it is indeed possible to find in polynomial time the minimum area upward drawing for complete trees. By the way, Mahaney's theorem implies that if such a problem is not in P , then it is not N P -complete either <ref> [9] </ref>, so that it should be very difficult to prove its intractability.
