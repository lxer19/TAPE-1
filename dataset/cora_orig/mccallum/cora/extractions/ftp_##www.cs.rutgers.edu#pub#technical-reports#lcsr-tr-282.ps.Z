Abstract: This paper considers the support of real-time applications to mobile hosts in an Integrated Services Packet Network. We have proposed a service model for mobile hosts that can support adaptive applications which can withstand wide range of available bandwidth, as well as applications which require mobility independent service guarantees. We describe an admission control scheme and a reservation protocol for implementing this service model. Our admission control scheme achieves high utilization of network resources.

Reference-contexts: Typical applications that require real-time services include audio library, image browsing, video conferencing and video-on-demand. These multimedia applications require a bound, which may be absolute or statistical, on the delivery delay of each packet. Clark et al., <ref> [4] </ref> have described an architecture for an ISPN that supports real-time traffic. In this architecture they have described a service model for real-time traffic with two service classes, guaranteed and predictive. Jamin et al.,[6] have described a scheme to implement the service model described in [4]. <p> Clark et al., <ref> [4] </ref> have described an architecture for an ISPN that supports real-time traffic. In this architecture they have described a service model for real-time traffic with two service classes, guaranteed and predictive. Jamin et al.,[6] have described a scheme to implement the service model described in [4]. As portable computers become more powerful and the accessibility of a fixed network from a mobile host becomes easier, the number of mobile users will grow and additionally the mobile users will demand the same real-time services available to fixed hosts. <p> In this paper, we investigate the 1 problems of providing real-time services to mobile hosts in an ISPN. As described in <ref> [4] </ref>, to handle real-time services an enhanced architecture is required for a network. This architecture has five key components. The first component is the nature of service commitments the network can provide. <p> In this paper, we discuss how mobile users can be accommodated within this architecture. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the problems of providing real-time services to mobile users in an ISPN and show why the mechanisms of <ref> [4] </ref> are not adequate for this purpose. <p> To provide real-time services, this congestion delay must be bounded or minimized. In <ref> [4] </ref>, real-time applications have been classified into two classes, tolerant applications which can adapt to packet delays and thus can tolerate occasional delay bound violations, and intolerant applications which cannot tolerate any delay bound violations. <p> models. 3.1 Mobility Specification The mobility specification of a mobile host consists the set of cells the mobile host is expected to visit during the lifetime of the flow. 3.2 Service Models The service models, we propose, are derived from the two service models, guaranteed and predictive services, described in <ref> [4] </ref> by Clark et al. We define three service classes to which mobile users may subscribe. These are: 1. <p> The MIG flows belong to the guaranteed service class; the MIP and MDP flows belong to the predictive class. There are multiple levels of predictive service with widely separated delay bounds. The scheduling algorithm considers only the active flows at a switch. The unified scheduling algorithm of <ref> [4] </ref> is used, i.e., guaranteed service is provided by the Weighted Fair Queuing scheduling discipline described in [10, 5] and the predictive service is provided by the priority queuing algorithm using the bandwidth leftover from serving guaranteed service.

We assume that the underlying routing protocol is the IETF Mobile-IP routing protocol <ref> [11] </ref>. In this protocol, there are mobility agents who have the necessary functionality to route packets destined for a mobile host. Each mobile host has a designated mobility agent, called home agent, in its home network.
