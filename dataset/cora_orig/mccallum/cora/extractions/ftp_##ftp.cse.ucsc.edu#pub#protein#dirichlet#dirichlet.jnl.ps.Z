Abstract: This paper presents the mathematical foundations of Dirichlet mixtures, which have been used to improve database search results for homologous sequences, when a variable number of sequences from a protein family or domain are known. We present a method for condensing the information in a protein database into a mixture of Dirichlet densities. These mixtures are designed to be combined with observed amino acid frequencies, to form estimates of expected amino acid probabilities at each position in a profile, hidden Markov model, or other statistical model. These estimates give a statistical model greater generalization capacity, such that remotely related family members can be more reliably recognized by the model. Dirichlet mixtures have been shown to outperform substitution matrices and other methods for computing these expected amino acid distributions in database search, resulting in fewer false positives and false negatives for the families tested. This paper corrects a previously published formula for estimating these expected probabilities, and contains complete derivations of the Dirichlet mixture formulas, methods for optimizing the mixtures to match particular databases, and suggestions for efficient implementation.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we propose the use of mixtures of Dirichlet densities (see e.g., <ref> ( Berhardo and Smith, 1994 ) </ref> ) as a means of representing prior information about expected amino acid distributions. In Section 2 we give a description of ways to interpret these mixtures. The mathematical foundations of the method described in this paper are given in Section 3.

Details of the results of these experiments are given in <ref> ( Brown et al., 1993 ) </ref> . 9 In retrospect, the high j~ffj of the LME prior may have handicapped this density in these experiments; j~ffj closer to 1 might have been more effective. 15 In our previous work, the NLL score has always been almost perfectly correlated with superior multiple

We extracted the EF-hand structures from each of the 242 sequences in the database, obtaining 885 EF-hand motifs having an average length of 29.

The Dirichlet priors we used for these experiments were derived from two sources of multiple alignments: a subset of alignments from the HSSP database suggested in <ref> ( Sander and Schneider, 1991 ) </ref> and multiple alignments we generated using HMMs to model the kinase, globin, and elongation factor families ( Haussler et al., 1993; Krogh et al., 1994 ) .

Reference-contexts: They have some of the desirable properties of Dirichlet 2 A comparison of Dirichlet mixtures with data-dependent pseudocount methods is given in ( Karplus, 1995a ) and <ref> ( Tatusov et al., 1994 ) </ref> , where Dirichlet mixtures were shown to give superior results. 5 mixtures, but because they have only a single component, they are unable to represent as complex a set of prototypical distributions. <p> Tatusov, Altschul and Koonin propose a technique in <ref> ( Tatusov et al., 1994 ) </ref> for iterative refinement of protein profiles that is able to start with very few aligned sequences (or even a single protein segment), and repeatedly compute a probability distribution over the amino acids for each column in the alignment, search a sequence database for protein segments <p> Good results with these mixtures are also reported by ( Wang et al., To appear ) , who, in a related set of experiments, created an expanded set of blocks using the same mixtures used in <ref> ( Tatusov et al., 1994 ) </ref> , and then used these blocks to classify protein sequences. In ( Bailey and Elkan, 1995 ) , the authors report several extensions to their motif-finding tool MEME which incorporate prior information into the parameter estimation process.
