Abstract: We consider the problem of providingcommunication protocol support for large-scale group collaboration systems for use in environments such as the Internet which are subject to packet loss, wide variations in end-to-end delays, and transient partitions. We identify a set of requirements that are critical for the design of such group collaboration systems. We present a communication service, Corona, that attempts to meet these requirements. Corona supports two communication paradigms: the publish/subscribe paradigm and the peer group paradigm. In the publish/subscribe paradigm one or more data sources or publishers send data to multiple subscribers. This paradigm is characterized by the anonymous nature of communication, where a publisher is aware of the set of subscribers, but the subscribers are unaware of each other and are only aware of the publisher that they are receiving data from. In the peer group paradigm of communication, on the other hand, all the group members are aware of each other, and can send and receive data directly to each other. We present the interfaces provided by Corona to group collaboration applications. We describe the semantics of each interface method call and show how they can meet a variety of group collaboration requirements. We describe the protocols used to implement these semantics.

Reference-contexts: For example, a failure that results in some users in a shared window collaboration losing connection to the collaboration should be announced to all surviving users. 3 Related Work Existing communications services that we are aware of, such as Isis [2], Consul [8], Transis <ref> [1] </ref>, Horus [11], and SRM [4], are lacking in the following dimensions: * No differentiation is made amongst classes of users. No support is provided for principals vs. observers.

Reference-contexts: Such collaborative applications allow people located geographically apart to share data amongst themselves and to act upon this data. This data may encompass a wide range of media and content. It may be graphical images, streams of raw data from various monitoring instruments <ref> [3] </ref>, application window element state [9], files, or plain text [6, 10]. In a collaborative system there are data sources or producers of the data and data recipients or consumers of the data. <p> Also, in certain situations, the number of recipients may be very large, and the data transport mechanisms must deliver the data in a cost-effective manner in such situations as well. We have been investigating such data transport issues within the context of the Upper Atmospheric Research Collaboratory (Uarc) project <ref> [3] </ref>. As part of this project we are developing a collaborative system to provide space scientists with the means to effectively view and analyze data collected by various remote instruments, present ones being located in Greenland.

Reference-contexts: Depending on the role of the user in these collaborative sessions, i.e., whether the user is a publisher, subscriber, observer, or principal, the view manager executes the appropriate protocols for ensuring that the user maintains the level of awareness associated with its role <ref> [5] </ref>. Message Multicast Manager This component multicasts a message to a group of users. For each destination, it obtains from the Failure Suspector the timeout and retransmit values. The message is then sent to each destination and re-transmitted at the timeout interval or until an acknowledgement is received.

Reference-contexts: Corona provides two classes of services: the publish/subscribe service and the peer group service. The publish/subscribe service is based on the publish/subscribe paradigm <ref> [7] </ref>, while the peer group service is based on the peer group paradigm. The publish/subscribe paradigm is characterized by one or more data sources or publishers sending data to multiple recipients or subscribers. The form of communication here is of an anonymous nature.
