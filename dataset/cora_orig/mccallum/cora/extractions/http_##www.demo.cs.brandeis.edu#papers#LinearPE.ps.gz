Abstract: The pursuer-evader (PE) game is recognized as an important domain in which to study the coevolution of robust adaptive behavior and protean behavior (Miller and Cliff, 1994). Nevertheless, the potential of the game is largely unrealized due to methodological hurdles in coevolutionary simulation raised by PE; versions of the game that have optimal solutions (Isaacs, 1965) are closed-ended, while other formulations are opaque with respect to their solution space, for the lack of a rigorous metric of agent behavior. This inability to characterize behavior, in turn, obfuscates coevolutionary dynamics. We present a new formulation of PE that affords a rigorous measure of agent behavior and system dynamics. The game is moved from the two-dimensional plane to the one-dimensional bit-string; at each time step, the evader generates a bit that the pursuer must simultaneously predict. Because behavior is expressed as a time series, we can employ information theory to provide quantitative analysis of agent activity. Further, this version of PE opens vistas onto the communicative component of pursuit and evasion behavior, providing an open-ended serial communications channel and an open world (via coevolution). Results show that subtle changes to our game determine whether it is open-ended, and profoundly affect the viability of arms-race dynamics.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, the PE game also presents methodological hurdles that highlight shortcomings in the state of the art of coevolutionary simulation itself. While some of these hurdles have diminished, most notably the red-queen effect <ref> (Cliff and Miller, 1995) </ref>, many others remain that demand a more lucid understanding of coevolutionary learning. Key issues involve the conditions that instigate competitive arms races or, to the contrary, mediocre stable-states (MSS) (Ange-line and Pollack, 1994; Pollack et al., 1997), neither of which are well understood.

Reference-contexts: More recent work casts PE into a purely discrete, non-kinematic reactive game (Koza, 1992; Reynolds, 1994), or into a continuous game of, essentially, imperfect information that incorporates a two-dimensional physical model <ref> (Cliff and Miller, 1996) </ref>, for example. Second, these differences in game formulation impact the nature of the solution space; where PE formulations have optimal solutions, the game is closed-ended and, therefore, categorically less interesting than an open-ended domain. <p> Third, and finally, agent behavior in PE is currently described exclusively in subjective, qualitative terms; as <ref> (Cliff and Miller, 1996) </ref> point out, there does not yet exist a quantitative, operational measure by which one can characterize and judge agent behavior.

Reference-contexts: Thus a random source is considered to be simpler than a completely predictable source of higher order; the size and structure of the Markov model is what counts, not the compressibility of the produced signal. This view is substantially similar to the notion of statistical complexity found in <ref> (Crutchfield, 1994) </ref>. 5.

Reference-contexts: Because behavior is expressed as a binary time series we can take advantage of information theory to provide precise characterizations of agent behavior and evolutionary progress. As importantly, recasting the PE game in this way opens vistas onto the communicative component of pursuit and evasion behavior. Recent work by <ref> (Di Paolo, 1997) </ref> raises a concern that much research on communication conflates functional utility with operational process: the utility of communicative behavior may very well be that it confers adaptiveness, yet communication so defined fails utterly to describe the behavior itself.

Reference-contexts: The above examples are emblematic of issues common to a great deal of work on communication, namely: powerful representations, small-scale communicative (behavioral) acts, fixed channels, and a fixed world. Viewed as an experiment in communication, our modified PE game provides 1) an open-ended serial communications channel <ref> (Gregory M. Saunders, 1996) </ref>, which can lead to 2) substantial communicative acts, and 3) an open world (via coevolution). Too, information theory provides a rigorous and accepted vocabulary for describing signal properties.

Reference-contexts: Our variant game may thus appear quite foreign. Indeed, it resembles the penny matching game, a version of which is used in a non-predictive context in parasite/host gene-matching simulations <ref> (Hamilton et al., 1990) </ref>. Nevertheless, we contend that our modifications distill the traditional PE game to its informational essence: given such an agile evader, the (equally agile) pursuer must induce, from observation of behavior, a model of the evader in order to be effective.

Reference-contexts: Rather than give their formal mathematical definitions, we emphasize a more intuitive explanation of these concepts and their implications as they relate to our domain. Formal detail can be found in <ref> (Hamming, 1980) </ref>. 4.1 Entropy Information theory is concerned with characterizing signals and their transmission. A signal source produces some symbol, which is passed through a channel to a receiver. We assume, for our purposes, that the channel does not distort the signal.

Reference-contexts: A comparable situation is found in a system where grammars evolve to climb the Chomsky hierarchy through a competitive game of string generation and parsing <ref> (Hashimoto and Ikegami, 1996) </ref>. The substrate in this case consists of explicit production rules, however, and the mutation operators allow the system to traverse the hierarchy easily.

Reference-contexts: First, there exist many versions of the PE game. The earliest formulations <ref> (Isaacs, 1965) </ref> are games of perfect information where optimal pursuit and evasion strategies follow analytically from agent capabilities.

Reference-contexts: In the second category of the taxonomy, we have systems that eschew convention; competitive games are designed to promote ever increasing "complexity," the precise meaning of which is inevitably domain-dependent. One game of imitation asks agents to observe another's behavior for some time and then reproduce that behavior <ref> (Kaneko and Suzuki, 1994) </ref>; the observation and reproduction phases of the game last 255 and 32 times steps, respectively. Agents are coevolved to become better imitators and more difficult to imitate.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The pursuer-evader (PE) game is argued to be an important domain for coevolutionary simulation <ref> (Miller and Cliff, 1994) </ref> due not only to its ubiquity in nature, but also because it provides a parsimonious, yet powerful, framework of investigation: robust adaptive behavior, open-ended coevolution, and adaptively unpredictable, or protean, behavior all fall within its purview.

Reference-contexts: Other work builds a self-organizing system that converges onto a convention of word/meaning associations <ref> (Steels, 1997) </ref>. The universe of discourse is the set of agents themselves, each of which is uniquely defined by a finite set of meanings, or feature/value pairs. Experiments described have on the order of twenty agents, five meanings, and five words.

Reference-contexts: A coarse taxonomy might divide much research to-date into two classes: convergent systems and competitive systems. Examples of the former include work that focuses on establishing common conventions of behavior. In <ref> (Werner and Dyer, 1991) </ref>, female and male agents converge onto a signaling convention that facilitates reproduction.

Reference-contexts: That regular generators out-score irregular ones by method A indicates that simple prediction strategies can be elicited from the predictor population | prediction strategies against which the most adaptive generators act as potent anti-signals, sequences that make predictors perform worse than random <ref> (Zhu and Kinzel, 1997) </ref>. Indeed, the champion generators shown in Figure 6 receive scores that indicate exactly this. Nevertheless, if the ballistic generators are to be viable as anti-signals, then there must exist some sufficient amount of homogeneity within the predictor population.
