Abstract: This paper presents a synthetic workload model that is capable of modeling self-similar Ethernet traffic. The design of the model is presented, along with a brief description of its implementation in SimKit, a C ++ -based simulation interface to support efficient parallel simulation on Shared Memory TimeWarp (SMTW). Preliminary simulation results are presented comparing the cell loss and cell delay performance in a simulated ATM network, both with and without the presence of self-similar traffic. Results suggest that simple Poisson traffic models, as opposed to self-similar traffic models, may underestimate ATM cell loss by several orders of magnitude, depending on the network utilization. Self-similar traffic models thus provide a valuable tool for "worst-case" stress testing of ATM networks.

Reference-contexts: This "non-Poisson" behaviour has serious implications on the performance of networks and systems that have been designed on the assumption of uncorrelated Poisson traffic. Understanding the performance implications of self-similar traffic is thus important to network designers and planners, and is especially relevant in the context of ATM networks <ref> (Frost and Melamed 1994) </ref>. ATM networks are based on a statistical multiplexing access method that assumes that the law of large numbers holds: given a large number of independent traffic flows, the aggregate bandwidth requirements for all the traffic flows is stable and predictable.

Reference-contexts: TES provides a very general approach to modeling first-order (i.e., frequency histogram) and second-order (i.e., autocorrelation function) statistics of time series. In this case, the time series of interest is the "packet count per interval" time series from the first step above. The testool <ref> (Geist and Melamed 1992) </ref> program was used to construct an abstract TES model that had the same frequency histogram and autocorrelation function as the (synthetic) Ethernet time series. One TES model was constructed for each value of H considered.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION Recent research in network traffic measurement has established the "self-similar" nature of aggregate Ethernet local area network (LAN) traffic <ref> (Leland et al. 1994) </ref>, as well as the presence of self-similarity in Internet traffic (Paxson and Floyd 1994) and video traffic (Garrett and Willinger 1994) as well. <p> In particular, Ethernet LAN traffic has been found to have a "fractal" self-similarity behaviour. Such behaviour has potentially serious implications on the design, control, modeling and analysis of high speed cell-based networks. The paper by Leland et al. <ref> (Leland et al. 1994) </ref> demonstrates that Ethernet LAN traffic is statistically self-similar in the sense that there is no natural length of a burst: at time scales ranging from milliseconds to seconds to minutes, similar-looking traffic bursts are evident. <p> The Hurst parameter expresses the be-haviour of the rescaled adjusted range statistic (R/S statistic) for large sample sizes n <ref> (Leland et al. 1994) </ref>. For many naturally occurring time series, including Ethernet traffic, E [R (n)=S (n)] is proportional to n H , with H "typically" about 0.7. For models with only short-range dependence, H is 0.5. This discrepancy is called the Hurst effect (Leland et al. 1994). <p> statistic) for large sample sizes n <ref> (Leland et al. 1994) </ref>. For many naturally occurring time series, including Ethernet traffic, E [R (n)=S (n)] is proportional to n H , with H "typically" about 0.7. For models with only short-range dependence, H is 0.5. This discrepancy is called the Hurst effect (Leland et al. 1994). Self-similarity manifests itself in a number of ways. One manifestation is a slowly decaying variance. <p> A third manifestation is a straight line of slope fi on a log-log plot of the R/S statistic. Ethernet traffic has been found to have this self-similarity property, and the degree of self-similarity tends to increase with the load level on the Ethernet <ref> (Leland et al. 1994) </ref>. Furthermore, the self-similarity property has been found to hold both in the traffic within a LAN, as well as in the traffic leaving a LAN destined for the Internet. <p> Data sets with higher self-similarity parameter H have higher "burstiness", in the intuitive sense. Empirical measurements of Ethernet traffic (both in <ref> (Leland et al. 1994) </ref> and at the University of Saskatchewan) suggest that the value of H for ag gregated LAN traffic is 0:7 H 0:9. * U: The network utilization 0 U 1 determines the average load level offered by the Ethernet LAN, as a fraction of its total 10 Mbps <p> Most Ethernets operate at low to moderate levels of load (e.g., 1% to 30% utilization). The utilization U has been empirically observed to have an effect on the degree of self-similarity observed in the traffic <ref> (Leland et al. 1994) </ref>. The higher the network load, the higher the degree of self-similarity usually observed. <p> The main methods used in the analysis are variance-time plots, and time-domain analysis based on the R/S-statistic. The latter method subdivides a given sample of N observations into K non-overlapping blocks and computes the rescaled adjusted range (R/S statistic) defined in <ref> (Leland et al. 1994) </ref>. Graphical R/S analysis is used to estimate the Hurst parameter H from the graph's asymptotic slope. More detail about this method can be found in (Leland et al. 1994). The same analysis methods are used to assess the self-similarity of the synthetically generated Ethernet traces. <p> subdivides a given sample of N observations into K non-overlapping blocks and computes the rescaled adjusted range (R/S statistic) defined in <ref> (Leland et al. 1994) </ref>.

The same analysis methods are used to assess the self-similarity of the synthetically generated Ethernet traces. Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 illustrate several characteristics of the synthetically generated Ethernet traces. <p> These plots are shown in a format similar to Figure 4 in the paper by Leland et al. <ref> (Leland et al. 1994) </ref>. When H = 0:5 in Figure 3 (i.e., the lefthand column), the time series aggregates to smooth traffic quite quickly as M increases from 1 to 1000. This behaviour is consistent with the law of large numbers for independent traffic arrivals (i.e., Poisson traffic). <p> This behaviour is consistent with the law of large numbers for independent traffic arrivals (i.e., Poisson traffic).

Cell delay, cell jitter, and cell loss may be significantly higher than predicted by simple traffic models.

The source code for the S program (ss.fourier) is given in the same appendix. * H: The Hurst parameter 0:5 H &lt; 1 expresses the degree of self-similarity in the traffic. <p> Another possible explanation is that our model is based on pseudo-self-similarity <ref> (Paxson and Floyd 1994) </ref>, not true self-similarity. (U = 0:1) (U = 0:1) aggregating bursty traffic streams together still results in bursty traffic. Thus cell loss in a network may be much higher than expected if network traffic is self-similar.
