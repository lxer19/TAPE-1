Reference-contexts: The first part of Figure 22 shows a steady-state request arrival pattern computed using an exponential function. This is unrealistic because demand fluctuations exist especially during "prime time" viewing hours <ref> [1] </ref>. One workload 94 based on known viewing patterns assumes the request rate between 6pm and 12am will be five times greater than the rest of the day. <p> Movie Selection: For each request made, a movie is selected using a Zipf distribution [112] which states that the probability that movie i is chosen equals c (i 1+ ) , where c is a normalizing constant. Empirical evidence presented in <ref> [1] </ref> suggests that = 0:271. The Zipf distribution roughly translates to an above average number of requests for popular or hot movies and less frequent requests for unpopular or cold movies. 3. Reneging Behavior: Various video delivery service models have been proposed and simulated [10, 40, 82].

Reference-contexts: Receivers then choose to receive only a subset of broadcast data. They receive whatever is sufficient to satisfy their request. Other research examines how "broadcast disks" can be used to deliver data over an asymmetric network by continually transmitting anticipated pages <ref> [2] </ref>. The disks paradigm allows multiple disks to be combined onto a single broadcast channel. Each disk can have different content sets; content can be ordered in different arrangements; and variations can be made in the frequency with which certain data is transmitted.

Reference-contexts: The mwatch tool [59] uses this information to create a global database of the multicast routing infrastructure. This database can be queried to obtain an estimate of a multicast route between any two hosts. This work has been advanced in <ref> [3] </ref> to allow individual users to 35 create their own database for the purposes of debugging incorrect static routes and tunnels. In the area of traffic analysis and usage statistics, [83] was a first effort in evaluating the volume and types of traffic carried on the MBone.

Reference-contexts: The problem with this approach is it leads to an expensive-to-operate, non-scalable system. Most VoD trials to-date have only been geared toward servicing a small population of customers (see for example <ref> [4] </ref>). In these systems, as the number of customer requests increases, the quality of service can only be maintained by significantly increasing server resources and network bandwidth. Scalability can only be achieved when system requirements have a sub-linear relationship to the maximum number of simultaneous customers.

In <ref> [10, 40, 39, 45] </ref>, it is proposed that some channels should be set aside to provide continuous service for such unpredictable VCR operations. These channels are referred to as contingency or emergency channels. <p> Empirical evidence presented in [1] suggests that = 0:271. The Zipf distribution roughly translates to an above average number of requests for popular or hot movies and less frequent requests for unpopular or cold movies. 3. Reneging Behavior: Various video delivery service models have been proposed and simulated <ref> [10, 40, 82] </ref>. The model used in this study is based on customers unwillingness to wait for service more than some finite amount of 95 time [111]. Because servicing is first come, first served, all requests will even-tually be satisfied.

Reference-contexts: Even single character losses or mutations can result in incorrectly displayed WWW pages. Research reported in [33] suggest there are significant advantages to using request aggregation and multicast communication. In our work, published in <ref> [11] </ref> and presented in Chapter 7, we propose the use of UDP multicast. Because 37 UDP multicast does not guarantee reliability it is less complex and has less over-head than reliable protocols. Error-free delivery is achieved using redundant, cyclic transmission of a particular page.

Reference-contexts: The algorithms discussed in [40] offer improved system performance but at the cost of fairness and uncertain wait times. If information about customer request patterns 32 is known in advance then scheduling can be done more intelligently [38]. Work in [40, 38, 39] and our work published in <ref> [15] </ref> and presented in Chapter 5 discusses several solutions to the scheduling problem. The Videotex system (mentioned in Section 3.1.2 and additionally in [47]) is the first to explore the relationship between response time and scheduling policies.

Reference-contexts: For cyclic multicast, the number of chunks/packets required is based on the number of cycles, t, needed to provide a high probability of error-free delivery of all chunks to all receivers, C m = C fl t. Using an analysis technique similar to <ref> [16] </ref>, a discrete time Markov chain is used to represent the progress of the system. The state of the system is the number of receivers that have received a particular chunk.

The MBone is an experimental network that overlays the In--ternet. Through the use of "tunnels" and native multicasting, the MBone forms a global multicast-capable network [41]. Low-quality, best-effort audio and video are the two main media types though there is also support for shared whiteboard and shared text applications. <p> VAT [71] and NeVoT [98] are the audio con-ferencing tool. NV [54] and IVS [104] are two alternate but complementary tools for providing video distribution. And finally, WB [73] provides a whiteboard facility for sharing text, graphics, and postscript among conference participants. The MBone <ref> [29] </ref> is an experimental virtual network created to provide the means for multicasting data to any number of connected hosts. Utilizing this connectivity, one well-established function of the MBone is as a platform for the development and testing of global conferencing tools capable of supporting hundreds of participants.

Reference-contexts: The MBone's paradigm of multiple concurrent sessions is similar to that of channelized content on traditional TV. The MBone was originally a set of Internet hosts that agreed to transmit the audio and video data of one host to the rest of the MBone <ref> [30] </ref>. Routing in the MBone was originally all static and pre-configured. As interest and use have grown, more and more of the Internet has become multicast capable and a variety of mul-ticast protocols are now being used. <p> Third, we propose rate-based channel allocation algorithms that solve the problems of the greedy algorithms. 137 Chapter 6 Multicast Group Behavior in the Multicast Backbone The Multicast Backbone (MBone) is a network integrated into the global Internet <ref> [30] </ref>. It provides one-to-many, best effort delivery of real-time multimedia data between MBone-connected hosts. The MBone has served as a testbed for the development of multicast protocols, real-time protocols, and group conferencing tools.

Reference-contexts: The effectiveness of caching is based on the ability of the server to utilize information about known server access patterns [27, 23]. Scalability through request aggregation and multicast communication has been explored in <ref> [33] </ref>. However, this work is based on the use of Single Connection Emulation (SCE)[103], a reliable multicast protocol built as a layer on top of TCP. Reliable delivery is necessary because most data types in the WWW are not robust against errors. <p> Reliable delivery is necessary because most data types in the WWW are not robust against errors. Even single character losses or mutations can result in incorrectly displayed WWW pages. Research reported in <ref> [33] </ref> suggest there are significant advantages to using request aggregation and multicast communication. In our work, published in [11] and presented in Chapter 7, we propose the use of UDP multicast. Because 37 UDP multicast does not guarantee reliability it is less complex and has less over-head than reliable protocols. <p> In these cases, the user can specify that reliable unicast be used instead. This may happen if a user does not have multicast capability or has not been able to successfully receive a page via multicast. Servicing of requests using reliable multicast is described in <ref> [33] </ref>. The operation of the cyclic component is described next. 188 7.2 Cyclic UDP Multicast The cyclic UDP multicast engine is most effectively used to deliver a site's most popular and heavily requested pages. The engine is capable of delivering multiple pages simultaneously using multiple multicast groups. <p> A compromise solution would have receivers immediately join a multicast group (thereby achieving very fast response if the server is actually transmitting) and then actually make the request to the server. Additional merits and limitations of these methods are discussed extensively in <ref> [33] </ref>. In either case, the TCP connection can be closed soon after the request is made and the resources used to handle other incoming requests. 191 7.2.3 Requester Operation The initial challenge for requesters is determining how the server will deliver a page.

Reference-contexts: This "cost" is computed using units of packet-hops (first used in <ref> [35] </ref>). One packet hop represents the resources required to transfer a packet between network routers. For a multicast tree the cost in packet-hops will be equal to the number of links in the tree. In computing the cost of reaching a set of destinations, we consider several types of trees. <p> The routes used are roughly approximated using the MWatch tool [59]. The multicast hop count is compared to a unicast hop count which is computed assuming that the source transmits to each receiver individually (also known as the separately-addressed packets scheme <ref> [35] </ref>). Instead of the transmitter sending one packet into the multicast 173 tree, one unicast packet is sent to each receiver. For simplicity, the unicast path is assumed to follow the multicast path. 2.

The Videotex system (mentioned in Section 3.1.2 and additionally in [47]) is the first to explore the relationship between response time and scheduling policies. <p> One set of proposed solutions achieve scalability by servicing multiple requests with a logical channel, i.e. the server and network resources required to provide continuous end-to-end delivery of a video stream. Program requests can be grouped or batched <ref> [40] </ref> using a variety of conventions (see Section 3.1.2) which results in one logical channel providing service to multiple customers simultaneously. In the server, batching means that the streamed program data need only be loaded from secondary or tertiary storage once. <p> Note that the server performs straightforward "First Come, First Serve" scheduling. Requests are not assigned priority, and no request is denied if resources exist to service it. Other scheduling disciplines are possible, and some have been investigated in <ref> [40] </ref>. Customers are informed through response messages whether their request is accepted or denied. All requests that arrive during the current slot are scheduled or rejected before the end of the slot. Figure 4 shows the flow of control messages between the server and set-top box. <p> The buffer can now be cleared up to the point where 1 As an example, a 67.5 MByte buffer is needed to store 6 minutes of MPEG-1 compressed video at 1.5 Mbps. 2 Alternatively, and as suggested in <ref> [40] </ref>, the customer can be removed from the movie stream and allocated another channel when the resumption of the movie is desired. <p> Grouping requests and servicing them using one logical channel is a critical step in improving performance. Some proposed algorithms attempt to achieve near optimal performance, independent of customer satisfaction, by forcing customers to wait as long as possible <ref> [40, 38, 39] </ref>. The idea is to maximize the number of customers per channel by aggregating as many requests for the same program as possible. <p> For example, one request might receive deluxe or preferred service for a higher fee and thus be served on a priority basis. However, in this chapter, we assume a first come, first served (FCFS) policy because it is fair, effective, and easy to implement <ref> [40] </ref>. In accordance with FCFS, the request in the front of the queue is served first and all other requests waiting for the same program are batched and serviced together. Program playout is decided by the channel allocation policy. <p> In general, a new channel has to be allocated when a customer initiates a VCR action and is no longer synchronized with the original batched stream. In <ref> [10, 40, 39, 45] </ref>, it is proposed that some channels should be set aside to provide continuous service for such unpredictable VCR operations. These channels are referred to as contingency or emergency channels. <p> Empirical evidence presented in [1] suggests that = 0:271. The Zipf distribution roughly translates to an above average number of requests for popular or hot movies and less frequent requests for unpopular or cold movies. 3. Reneging Behavior: Various video delivery service models have been proposed and simulated <ref> [10, 40, 82] </ref>. The model used in this study is based on customers unwillingness to wait for service more than some finite amount of 95 time [111]. Because servicing is first come, first served, all requests will even-tually be satisfied.

Low-quality, best-effort audio and video are the two main media types though there is also support for shared whiteboard and shared text applications. <p> Multicast communication is especially important for use with a variety of applications including conferencing, computer supported collaborative work, remote interaction and large-scale information dissemination. The availability of IP multicast <ref> [41] </ref> in the Internet has facilitated the development of a set of first generation conferencing tools capable of connecting people all over the world. The SD [72] tool provides a mechanism for disseminating 33 information about available sessions. VAT [71] and NeVoT [98] are the audio con-ferencing tool. <p> Using multicast communication means that the same data will not be transmitted multiple times over the same link or segment at the same time <ref> [41] </ref>. Achieving scalability by grouping requests means that a system's ability to provide VCR-like interactivity is made much more difficult. Because there may be 43 multiple customers per channel, interactivity can not be provided by simply mod-ifying the stream being watched by the entire group. <p> Figure 20 shows the server and client prototypes. 79 80 The delivery of multicast data over an IP-based internetwork is a relatively straightforward implementation <ref> [41] </ref>. When started, both the AoD server and clients open a UDP socket to send and receive control messages, i.e. initial song and group change requests/responses. When a channel is allocated, the actual data transmission occurs using IP multicast and a unique UDP port number. <p> This solution is neither cost effective nor scalable, and will cease to be an option as the web grows in popularity. In this chapter we apply our techniques for scalability including a new protocol providing reliability over UDP multicast <ref> [41] </ref>. In our protocol, reliability is achieved through repetitive, cyclic multicast transmission of a requested page. This solution is expected to be most effective when used for highly requested pages, typically a popular site's top level page, for example, CNN Interactive at http://cnn.com.

In [60] the issue is using broadcast delivery for communicating very large amounts of data.

Efforts by the IETF to improve the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) have resulted in a much more efficient protocol than the one used by Mosaic <ref> [51] </ref>. Other research looks at improvements in scalability using caching [27] and parallel processing of requests [76, 22]. The effectiveness of caching is based on the ability of the server to utilize information about known server access patterns [27, 23].

Reference-contexts: Some applications use UDP multicast but add additional delivery services like reliability or quality of service. For example, Application Level Framing (ALF) is based on UDP multicast but has its own method of providing reliable data exchange <ref> [52] </ref>. Some of the application types we investigate require reliable data delivery but others need only best effort delivery and acceptable packet loss rates to provide service. Therefore, when possible we try to use UDP multicast, and if necessary, achieve reliability by some additional mechanism.

Reference-contexts: The workstation implementation of multicast routing, mrouted [44], provides several tools including mtrace [50] and mrinfo which poll multicast-capable routers for information about tunnels and capabilities. The mwatch tool <ref> [59] </ref> uses this information to create a global database of the multicast routing infrastructure. This database can be queried to obtain an estimate of a multicast route between any two hosts. <p> The types of trees we consider are: 1. MBone Tree with Observed Source: We use the MBone topology and create a source to destination set tree. The routes used are roughly approximated using the MWatch tool <ref> [59] </ref>. The multicast hop count is compared to a unicast hop count which is computed assuming that the source transmits to each receiver individually (also known as the separately-addressed packets scheme [35]).

Reference-contexts: Another effort in this area proposes a system in which requests are satisfied as soon as possible, but then the playout speed is increased or decreased so requests for the same program can be joined and serviced with the same channel <ref> [61] </ref>. 31 Having multiple customers watching the same channel makes the provision of interactive VCR-like functions much more difficult. For true VoD systems which do not use multicast communication, interactivity can be provided by simply modifying each customer's audio/video stream individually.

Reference-contexts: The number of logical channels in a cable network is derived from the number of NTSC quality audio/video streams that can be supported. The control channel is bi-directional but requires significantly less bandwidth than a downstream channel. Because cable networks typically use a tree-branch topology <ref> [75] </ref>, any transmission from the head end is considered a broadcast transmission reaching all receivers. Even transmissions destined for only one receiver will use a full channel in the cable network.

Reference-contexts: scalability vs interactivity has been the focus of some of our research [10, 8, 7, 5]. 4.1 Achieving Both Scalability and Interactivity In true VoD systems, the approach is to service customers individually by allocating and dedicating a transmission channel and a set of server resources to each 41 customer <ref> [82] </ref>. The problem with this approach is it leads to an expensive-to-operate, non-scalable system. Most VoD trials to-date have only been geared toward servicing a small population of customers (see for example [4]). <p> Systems that do not scale are therefore undesirable and impractical. * Handle Load During "Prime Time": Usage models strongly suggest that there exist at least two different usage periods during a typical day <ref> [82] </ref>. More requests will typically be made between the "prime time" hours of 6pm and 12am then during the rest of the day. <p> Performance is measured in terms of the server's ability to satisfy customer requests. The model is based on two assumptions: 62 1. The number of requests that arrive during the six evening hours known as "prime time" will be significantly higher than any other time of the day <ref> [82] </ref>. During this period, the scalability of a system becomes critical. For this reason, our simulation only measures performance during these six hours. 2. The request rate is measured in terms of the total number of requests that arrive during the prime time hours. <p> Susceptibility to load conditions severely reduces the ability of a video server to provide adequate service during an entire day. Empirical data suggests load conditions can vary significantly during a 24 hour period <ref> [38, 82] </ref>. We identify four possible 24 hour workload models and examine their affect on the performance of the channel allocation algorithms and then again on the performance of the overall system. The first is the base case steady state. <p> Customer behavior defines the request arrival pattern or workload at the server. Over a 24-hour simulation period 93 the workload is expected to vary depending on the time of day <ref> [39, 82] </ref>. In axis represents time, and the vertical axis shows the number of requests that arrive during a six minute reporting interval. The first part of Figure 22 shows a steady-state request arrival pattern computed using an exponential function. <p> Empirical evidence presented in [1] suggests that = 0:271. The Zipf distribution roughly translates to an above average number of requests for popular or hot movies and less frequent requests for unpopular or cold movies. 3. Reneging Behavior: Various video delivery service models have been proposed and simulated <ref> [10, 40, 82] </ref>. The model used in this study is based on customers unwillingness to wait for service more than some finite amount of 95 time [111]. Because servicing is first come, first served, all requests will even-tually be satisfied.

Reference-contexts: For 1% loss, 1.0101 cycles are required; for 5% loss, 1.0526 cycles are required; for 10% loss, 1.1111 cycles are required; and for 20% loss, 1.25 cycles are required. For cyclic multicast the use of error correction techniques can help reduce waiting times <ref> [88] </ref>. Furthermore, the use of chunking and browser display algorithms can be used to display parts of a page as soon as the browser gets them. This mechanism works well for unicast and will work for cyclic multicast. simulation when each of the 10000 requests is satisfied.

Reference-contexts: The first research looked at using multicast and broadcast communication as an information delivery mechanism <ref> [108, 109] </ref>. By transmitting information requested by one user to everyone, any outstanding request for the same information waiting to be serviced can also be satisfied. Not until several years later is this work being advanced and adapted for use in video-on-demand systems [5, 7, 40]. <p> UDP multicast is one alternative to achieving scalability without relying on a network protocol to provide reliability. The general delivery of information via multicast has been proposed in several papers. The Videotex system has been examined extensively. In particular, <ref> [108] </ref> is a first examination of using broadcast delivery while [47] looks more closely at specific scheduling issues. In [60] the issue is using broadcast delivery for communicating very large amounts of data. The datacycle architecture discussed in [67] looks at how broadcast delivery can be used in database systems. <p> Instead of pre-scheduled programming delivered over numerous broadcast channels, customers will have the ability to tailor content by requesting specific programs. In order for video delivery systems to service a large number of customers and remain cost effective, multicast communication must be used <ref> [108] </ref>. However, the use of multicast creates a trade-off of individualized vs. group servicing. At one extreme, group servicing improves scalability but limits interactivity. At the other extreme, the opposite is true.

The other factor is the popularity of a particular movie. The system is more likely to be able to group requests for currently popular movies than for a less frequently requested movie.

Reference-contexts: Systems similar to Videotex which deal with scheduling and resource allocation include [55, 90].

The model used in this study is based on customers unwillingness to wait for service more than some finite amount of 95 time <ref> [111] </ref>. Because servicing is first come, first served, all requests will even-tually be satisfied. However, during high-load periods a customer's wait time may be very long (on the order of 15 or more minutes). Customers will most likely be unwilling to wait this long.

Interactive Function Usage. Figure 11 represents the viewing pattern for one customer watching one movie. <p> This type of workload is based on the belief that broadcast programs that start and end at the start/end of each hour will still exist and impact on-demand behavior. 2. Movie Selection: For each request made, a movie is selected using a Zipf distribution <ref> [112] </ref> which states that the probability that movie i is chosen equals c (i 1+ ) , where c is a normalizing constant.
