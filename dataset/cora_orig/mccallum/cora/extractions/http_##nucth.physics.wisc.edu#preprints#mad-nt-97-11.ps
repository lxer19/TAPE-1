Abstract: We introduce simple analytic expressions for the neutrino survival probability in media valid in the quasi-adiabatic limit. These expressions provide a quick but accurate alternative to numerical solution of the neutrino propagation equations for the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effect. They can also be used to extract information about the density scale height from the neutrino data. As an example, we present calculations for solar neutrinos.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, analytic approximations are usually sufficient to highlight the salient physics. A convenient starting point for most approximations is the formula <ref> [2] </ref> for the averaged survival probability of a given neutrino flavor: P - (E) = 2 In this equation the vacuum- and matter-mixing angles are introduced in the usual way, two-flavor mixing is assumed, and P hop denotes the probability of hopping from one adiabatic eigenstate to the other.

Reference-contexts: It is straightforward to solve the appropriate equations of motion analytically in some special cases <ref> [5] </ref>, and numerically for an arbitrary density profile. However, as one is treating a quantum-mixing problem over considerable distances, calculations which search a broad range of parameter space may quickly become more tedious than this fundamentally simple level-crossing problem should warrant.

Reference-contexts: For purposes of demonstration, however, we will neglect the variation of P hop with production point. Eq. (2) for P hop is valid for an arbitrary density profile, and for a large range of mixing parameters. In Ref. <ref> [6] </ref>, a uniform semiclassical solution of the MSW equations was introduced, and solved numerically. In Ref. [7], a complete analytic solution for the oscillation probability (including interference terms) was given, and the expression for P hop above derived as a consequence.

For the small-angle solution to the solar neutrino anomaly, the propagation is nonadiabatic in the energy range of interest.

Reference-contexts: The resonance condition ffim 2 E p relates the density probed by the resonance to a given neutrino energy. In Figure 1 (a), we show the density profile from the 1995 standard solar model (SSM) of Bahcall and Pinsonneault <ref> [10] </ref>. For the small angle solution, the resonance for a 5 MeV neutrino occurs at about 0:35R fi ; for a 15 MeV neutrino it occurs at at about 0:45R fi . In that region, the solar density is approximately exponential.

Reference-contexts: The first term in Eq. (7) represents the contribution of the exponential density profile alone (as was implicit in the treatment in Ref. <ref> [14] </ref>). Eq. (7) is remarkable in that it directly connects an expansion of the logarithm of the hopping probability in powers of 1=E to an expansion of the density scale height.

Reference-contexts: The SNO and SK detectors are sensitive to the spectrum distortion due to the MSW effect. In Figure 4, we calculate the spectrum distortion for the small angle MSW solution at SNO, using the method of Ref. <ref> [15] </ref> and neglecting backgrounds. For the calculation of the neutrino-deuterium charged-current cross-sections we used the code of Bahcall and Lisi [16]. This encoded differential charged-current cross-section is based on the Ellis-Bahcall effective range calculation [17] with slight improvements. <p> We found the electron neutrino survival probabilities by full-fledged numerical integration of the MSW equation through the standard solar model of Bahcall and Pinsonneault. Again, we used the method of Ref. <ref> [15] </ref>, which takes account of SNO's finite electron energy resolution. We then randomly generated 2000 electron energy spectra, Poisson-distributed about the theoretical expectation. We fit each of the 2000 statistical instances with Eq. (7), and used that the fit coefficients to produce 2000 measured scale height profiles.
