Reference-contexts: In [28], Lawrence exploits the links between orthogonal arrays, finite projective geometry and both linear and nonlinear error-correcting codes to construct GOAs via the aforementioned construction method from [27]. With this approach he is able to obtain a number of improvements in net parameters. Construction 23. In <ref> [1] </ref> Adams and Shader use arrays, called M arrays, of elements of the finite field F q in which certain collections of rows are linearly independent, along with linear codes to give a new construction of generalized orthogonal arrays.

Reference-contexts: We note that for certain parameter ranges there is also an explicit lower bound for N; the dual Plotkin bound, which is due to Bierbrauer <ref> [2] </ref>. In the binary case, this explicit bound is equivalent to the LP bound, see [3]. Lawrence has inverted the dual Plotkin bound and obtained explicit upper bounds for the quantities f (N; b; d) for the same parameter ranges, see [29].

Reference-contexts: If the number of rows did not exceed about 40, satisfactory results were obtained very easily using the AMPL mathematical programming language [14] in combination with the CPLEX optimization system <ref> [4] </ref>. However, for larger numbers of rows (up to 100) this procedure did not yield results that were accurate to the nearest integer, and we instead used the simplex algorithm that is implemented in the MAPLE programming language [7].

Reference-contexts: An official ACM software package implementing the (t; s)-sequences of Niederreiter (see Construction 9 in [35]) was announced in Bratley, Fox, and Niederreiter <ref> [5] </ref>. Another construction of (t; s)-sequences yielding the same parameters as that of Niederreiter was discussed in Tezuka [54, Chapter 6] and Tezuka and Tokuyama [55].

Reference-contexts: However, for larger numbers of rows (up to 100) this procedure did not yield results that were accurate to the nearest integer, and we instead used the simplex algorithm that is implemented in the MAPLE programming language <ref> [7] </ref>. This was very much slower, but did produce exact answers in these parameter situations, i.e. for orthogonal arrays with 100 or fewer rows. Consequently, values for LP (b h ; b; h t) could only be inferred when these values did not exceed 99.

Reference-contexts: We refer to Section 3 for further information on the construction of (t; s)-sequences by these methods. Construction 19. A short paper by Clayman and Mullen <ref> [8] </ref> gives a computer implementation of the Gilbert-Varshamov bound from coding theory which provides a sufficient condition for the existence of a linear code with a given set of parameters. Schmid [51, p. 33] provides an analogous sufficient condition for the existence of a digital net. <p> Schmid [51, p. 33] provides an analogous sufficient condition for the existence of a digital net. Most of the improvements arising from <ref> [8] </ref> are for base 5. Typeset by A M S-T E X Construction 20. Schmid and Wolf in [53] provide a series of bounds for both digital (t; m; s)-nets and digital (t; s)-sequences.

Reference-contexts: Then f (N; b; d) R (N; b; d): Another upper bound on f (N; b; d) can be obtained from linear programming, following the work of Delsarte <ref> [9] </ref>, and produces results which are always at least as good as Rao's bound (see [15]). We write LP (N; b; d) for the maximum number of rows, k; such that the existence of an orthogonal array (N; k; b; d) is not denied by the linear programming bound.

New (t; m; s)-net constructions. In this section we briefly describe the new constructions for (t; m; s)-nets which have arisen since the publication of [35]. We continue with the numbering which in [35] ended with Construction 16. Construction 17. <p> A number of specific examples are constructed in bases q = 2; 3; 4; with some being obtained by machine calculation. Construction 25. In <ref> [11] </ref> Edel and Bierbrauer provide three families of digital nets in base b = 2 and one family in base b = 3: The constructions are combinatorial in nature and are obtained by using ordered orthogonal arrays and BCH codes.

Related applications to the numerical integration of multivariate Haar series were studied by Entacher <ref> [12] </ref>. Error bounds for the calculation of volumes of Jordan-measurable sets by quasi-Monte Carlo methods with (t; m; s)-nets were given by Lecot [33].

Reference-contexts: A new way of obtaining upper bounds for the star discrepancy of digital (t; m; s)- nets was developed by Larcher [19], and this method was applied in Larcher [18] to obtain probabilistic results on the star discrepancy of sequences constructed by the digital method. Faure and Chaix <ref> [13] </ref> proved a lower bound of the best possible order of magnitude for the star discrepancy of a special (0; 2)-sequence in base 2.

Reference-contexts: The linear programming bounds for certain parameter values were then obtained using Delsarte's method, which was implemented in two ways. If the number of rows did not exceed about 40, satisfactory results were obtained very easily using the AMPL mathematical programming language <ref> [14] </ref> in combination with the CPLEX optimization system [4].

Reference-contexts: Before discussing this new bound, we recall the basic notion of an orthogonal array, which is due to Rao [49] (see <ref> [15] </ref> for more details). Let k; N; d be positive integers with k d and let b 2 be an integer. <p> We note that the transposed array is sometimes used, as for example in <ref> [15] </ref>. We now state the orthogonal array bound for nets, due to Lawrence [27, Thm. 6.1; 29]. Theorem. <p> A general upper bound on k; the number of rows in an orthogonal array (N; k; b; d); was obtained by Rao [49] and expressed in the form of certain inequalities which the parameters of any orthogonal array must satisfy, see <ref> [49, 26, 27, 15] </ref>. Let R (N; b; d) be the maximum number of factors or rows, k; such that the existence of an orthogonal array (N; k; b; d) is not denied by Rao's inequalities. <p> Then f (N; b; d) R (N; b; d): Another upper bound on f (N; b; d) can be obtained from linear programming, following the work of Delsarte [9], and produces results which are always at least as good as Rao's bound (see <ref> [15] </ref>). We write LP (N; b; d) for the maximum number of rows, k; such that the existence of an orthogonal array (N; k; b; d) is not denied by the linear programming bound.

Reference-contexts: It is of special interest to note that the orthogonal array bound for nets cannot always be attained and so is not best possible, in general. In particular, it follows from this bound that a (1; 5; s)-net in base 2 can exist only if s 6: However, Lawrence <ref> [30] </ref> used properties of orthogonal arrays and generalized orthogonal arrays, together with further combinatorial arguments to show that there is no (1; 5; 6)-net in base 2.

Reference-contexts: Rote and Tichy [50] gave bounds for the dispersion of (t; m; s)-nets. The volume discrepancy of (0; s)-sequences was studied by Xiao <ref> [56] </ref> and Xiao and Faure [58]. The paper of Xiao [57] is devoted to geometric properties of (0; m; 2)-nets. Further investigations of randomized (t; m; s)-nets were carried out by Hickernell [16] and Owen [48].
