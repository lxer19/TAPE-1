Abstract: Advanced perceptual systems are faced with the problem of securing a principled relationship between the world and its internal representation. I propose a unified approach to visual representation, based on Shepard's (1968) notion of second-order isomorphism. According to the proposed theory, a shape is represented internally by the responses of a few tuned modules, each of which is broadly selective for some reference shape, whose similarity to the stimulus it measures. The result is a philosophically appealing, computationally feasible, biologically credible, and formally veridical representation of a distal shape space. This approach supports representation of and discrimination among shapes radically different from the reference ones, while bypassing the need for the computationally problematic decomposition into parts; it also addresses the needs of shape categorization, and can be used to derive a range of models of perceived similarity.

Reference-contexts: The impact of this evidence seems to have been limited by a persistent concern that the feature detectors do not "really" 29 detect the features they happen to be tuned to (Dretske, 1981; Fodor, 1987; Cummins, 1989). 13 Nevertheless, it has been suggested <ref> (Albright, 1991) </ref> that philosophical worries regarding possibility of Lockean conformity in the functioning of feature detectors found in the brain should be quelled to some extent by the successful manipulation of the organism's perception of a feature through the injection of current in the vicinity of the appropriate detector pool in

Reference-contexts: feature of the stimulus is its similarity to the i'th reference object. 10 The concept of a feature detector originally developed under the influence of the discovery of "bug detectors" in the frog retina (Lettvin et al., 1959), and was linked to the notion of behavior-releasing mechanisms, borrowed from ethology <ref> (Barlow, 1979) </ref>. Its generalization to higher perceptual functions such as shape recognition was subsequently attempted.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, the theories mention merely "isomorphism," it being implied that the isomorphism holds between structures (and is, therefore, "second-order," in Shepard's terms), and not between individual entities (Palmer, 1978; Holland et al., 1986; Gallistel, 1990).

The stimuli in these experiments were obtained by translating the parts of the animal-like shapes to a common center, resulting in star-like nonsense objects. For these objects, the similarity between true and MDS-recovered configurations was consistently lower than for animal-like shapes.

Reference-contexts: It may be possible to address this requirement, to some extent, by coupling mechanisms that are selective for scale and retinal location with those that are selective for shape (Edelman, 1994). A well-founded approach to such a coupling, built around a recently developed computational mechanism called the Helmholtz Machine <ref> (Dayan et al., 1995) </ref>, has been implemented and tested (on stylized face images) by Riesenhuber and Dayan (1997). According to the reasoning of Dayan et al., complex underconstrained perceptual tasks require an intimate cooperation between bottom-up, or data-driven processes, and top-down, or expectation-driven ones.

Note that a number of classifiers, each tuned to a different reference point, must be activated (just as in triangulation a number of landmarks must be used for each measurement).

Note that a number of classifiers, each tuned to a different reference point, must be activated (just as in triangulation a number of landmarks must be used for each measurement). An ensemble or a Chorus (Edelman, 1995b) of k classifiers maps the distal shape space to a proximal representation space, R k . If the response of each classifier degrades gracefully with the dissimilarity between the test stimulus and the preferred shape, the entire ensemble realizes a mapping M which is smooth and regular.

Reference-contexts: The debate between theories that involve dynamically bound generic parts and prototype-based theories parallels the classical dispute between Empiricist and Rationalist theories of concepts, in which the main argument against prototype-based theories is their alleged failure to support compositionality and productivity <ref> (Fodor, 1981, p.296) </ref>. That argument, however, hinges on a logicist approach, which does not recognize any way of combining simple concepts into complex ones, short of logical/syntactical connectives.

Reference-contexts: Essentially, this is a call for representation of similarity instead of representation by similarity (see Figure 1). 2 1 Agreement between patterns derived from visual and haptic perceptual data has been also reported <ref> (Garbin, 1990) </ref>. 2 The idea of representation by second-order isomorphism has been advanced, under various guises, in a number of fields in cognitive science. Typically, the researchers in these fields take for granted the implausibility of representation by similarity, that is, by first-order isomorphism.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and overview 1.1 Motivation A common assumption underlying theories of vision is that a representation of the world | a geometrical replica (Marr, 1982), and possibly also affordances relevant to the required repertoire of actions <ref> (Gibson, 1966) </ref> | should be delivered to the decision-making stage of an intelligent system, natural or artificial. Achieving principled correspondence between the representation and the world is a challenging philosophical and computational problem. On the philosophical level, one would like to know how, in principle, is representation possible.

The Aristotelian representation by similarity appealingly solves the qualia problem by equating these perceptual qualities with the physical qualities of the corresponding percepts (i.e., the internal representations).

Indeed, as I shall argue in section 5, a distance-based definition of similarity does not preclude one from modeling a considerable variety of similarity-related phenomena in human perception.

Together with the previous reports of a hierarchical two-stage approach to (relative) invariance in the face cells <ref> (Perrett et al., 1989) </ref>, these findings suggest that a cell that responds to a certain shape nearly irrespectively of its view (and that in a cortical implementation of Chorus would be termed a reference-object or "prototype" cell) may do so by integrating the responses of several cells each of which prefers

More importantly, in the light of the possibility of veridical representation of distal changes by proximal ones, as in Shepard's (1968) theory of second-order isomorphism, the philosophical lure of settling the question regarding what this or that individual feature detector "really" detects is significantly reduced.

Reference-contexts: The main tool at the disposal of a psychologist who wishes to show that representations of a set of stimuli can be taken to form a spatial order is multidimensional scaling <ref> (see Shepard, 1980, for a review) </ref>. Using this technique, it is possible to show that, in a wide variety of perceptual tasks, subjects behave as if they represent the stimuli by distributions of points in an internal similarity space of the kind that is needed here (Shepard, 1987; Nosofsky, 1992). <p> Among the examples of this procedure given in <ref> (Shepard, 1980) </ref>, one finds the application of MDS to the processing of perceived similarities between Morse signals (the data were obtained by asking unskilled subjects to decide whether two consecutively sounded signals were same or different).

Reference-contexts: space. 8 major reason for maintaining internal representations is generalization: any system, at any point in time, will have encountered only a finite number of (labeled or rewarded) stimuli; for any other stimulus, the response will have to be generalized, based on memory traces of past experiences with related stimuli <ref> (Shepard, 1987) </ref>. A representation whose fidelity is limited to distinctness provides no basis for generalization, because it does not contain information concerning relationships between stimuli, beyond the identity of each of them. Nearest-neighbor preservation. <p> com 18 putational approach to second-order isomorphism in Chorus is related to other work by Shepard | his law of generalization, which points out that the likelihood of obtaining the same response to two stimuli decreases exponentially with their separation in a psychological space, as defined, e.g., by multidimensional scaling <ref> (Shepard, 1987) </ref>. Within a connectionist framework, Shepard's law of generalization can be implemented in a straightforward manner, by constructing tuned units that exhibit radially symmetric exponential decay around the location of the preferred stimulus in a feature space (Hanson and Gluck, 1993; Shepard and Kannappan, 1993).

In shape-space localization, the response profile of each of the classifiers in Chorus defines a "receptive field" over the space S.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, the philosophical foundation of the current theories of shape representation is still isomorphism: typically, it is assumed that structural (Biederman, 1987) or metric <ref> (Ullman, 1989) </ref> information stored in the brain reflects corresponding properties of shapes in the world, on a one to one basis.

Reference-contexts: The central problem here lies in the fine resolution that must be attained despite the residual misalignment left over from the action of the normalizing transformation T . This problem can be approached by learning hyperacuity in the instance space. In hyperacuity-related visual tasks such as vernier discrimination <ref> (Westheimer, 1981) </ref>, spatial resolution better than the spacing of the photoreceptors on the retina is attained by combined action of graded overlapping receptive fields (Snippe and Koenderink, 1992). In shape-space localization, the response profile of each of the classifiers in Chorus defines a "receptive field" over the space S.
