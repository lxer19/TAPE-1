As the quality of the mesh degrades and small angles are introduced, the bounds on both 1 and N are adversely affected and the condition number increases proportion ally.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The quality of finite element and finite volume meshes has long been known to affect both the efficiency and the accuracy of the numerical solution of application problems (e.g., see <ref> [6] </ref> and [14]). To improve the quality of these meshes, several researchers have devised new algorithms based on local reconnection schemes, node smoothing, and adaptive refinement or coarsening (e.g. [2, 10, 18, 19, 29, 30]).

Reference-contexts: Clearly, smoothing alone improves the angle distribution, dramatically reducing the number of both small and large angles. When combined with swapping, the improvement is even greater. Flow around the cylinder was computed by using an edge-based, vertex-centered finite volume solver. Second-order accuracy was attained by using least-squares reconstruction <ref> [9, 26, 27] </ref>. Following reconstruction, fluxes were computed by using Roe's flux formula and integrated for each control volume. Time advance was performed using an explicit multistage scheme with multigrid convergence acceleration [28].

In both two and three dimensions, this technique can be used to change the topological connections among the vertices making up the simplices incident on a single face. <p> The latter is applicable only along mesh boundaries. A more advanced technique in three dimensions is the reconfiguration of all tetrahedra incident on a single edge. This technique is known as edge swapping or edge removal. Our approach, described in detail in <ref> [13] </ref>, operates by viewing the edge to be swapped end-on and choosing the "triangulation" of the vertices not on that edge that maximizes some mesh quality measure. <p> Optimization-based smoothing techniques offer an alternative to Laplacian smoothing that can be inexpensive, can guarantee valid elements in the final mesh, and can be effective for a wide variety of mesh quality measures. In <ref> [12, 13] </ref>, we described an efficient, local smoothing algorithm based on optimization techniques for piecewise smooth, continuous functions that move the grid points in a manner guaranteed to maintain or improve mesh quality. <p> This technique was shown to be as effective in mesh improvement as the strictly optimization-based approach, at a fraction of the computational cost. 3.3 Recommendations We now summarize our recommendations for two-dimensional mesh improvement based on geometric quality measures <ref> [13] </ref>. * Local reconnection should be followed with mesh smoothing to improve mesh quality. Three to four passes of a combined Laplacian/optimization-based smoother with a floating threshold is the most efficient smoothing technique. <p> We recommend maximizing the minimum sine of element angle (dihedral angle in three dimensions) as a good general-purpose criterion. * In three dimensions, edge swapping is beneficial and should be used. Also, the use of advanced techniques such as BATR <ref> [13] </ref> is highly beneficial in improving tetrahedral meshes. 5 4 Effect of Mesh Quality on Convergence We begin our cost/benefit analysis of mesh improvement techniques in terms of solution efficiency by considering two model problems on the unit square.

We note that similar optimization-based smoothing methods have been proposed by a number of researchers <ref> [1, 8, 32] </ref> for a variety of optimization procedures and mesh quality measures. The optimization-based approach is quite effective, however its computational cost is high compared with Laplacian smoothing. To address this problem, Freitag developed a family of combined Laplacian and optimization-based smoothing techniques [11].

Reference-contexts: If the spectrum of A is not uniformly distributed|that is, if there are isolated eigenvalues at either end of the spectrum|Equation 1 overestimates the iteration count, and improved bounds can be obtained in both exact arithmetic (e.g., [5]) and in the presence of rounding error (e.g. <ref> [24, 17, 33] </ref>). Let the eigenvalues of such a system be denoted by 1 ; 2 ; :::; p ; [a; b]; q ; :::; N , where [a; b] represents the continuous part of the spectrum and the remaining eigenvalues are isolated values at either end of the spectrum.
