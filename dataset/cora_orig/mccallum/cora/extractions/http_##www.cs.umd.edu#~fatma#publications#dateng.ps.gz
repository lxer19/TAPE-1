Abstract: In this paper, we describe a dynamic query optimization technique for a multidatabase system, namely MIND, implemented on a DOM environment. A Distributed Object Management (DOM) architecture, when used as the infrastructure of a multidatabase system, not only enables easy and flexible interoperation of DBMSs, but also facilitates interoperation of the multidatabase system with other repositories that do not have DBMS capabilities. This is an important advantage, since most data still resides on repositories that do not have DBMS capabilities. Dynamic query optimization, which schedules intersite operations at run-time, fits better to such an environment since it benefits from location transparency provided by the DOM framework. In this way, the dynamic changes in the configuration of system resources such as a relocated DBMS or a new mirror to an existing DBMS, do not affect the optimized query execution in the system. Furthermore, the uncertainty in estimating the appearance times (i.e., the execution time of the global subquery at a local DBMS) of partial results are avoided because there is no need for the dynamic optimizer to know the logical cost parameters of the underlying local DBMS. The performance of the developed method is compared with two other most related techniques and the results of the experiments indicate that the dynamic query optimization technique presented in this paper has better performance.

Reference-contexts: One restriction of multidatabase systems has been that they are able to provide interoperability only among DBMSs and can not handle repositories which do not have DBMS capabilities. The Distributed Object Management (DOM) approach has lifted this restriction <ref> [2, 9] </ref>. When a DOM architecture is used as the infrastructure of a multidatabase system, it easily becomes possible to provide interoperability of a multidatabase system with other repositories that do not have DBMS capabilities.

Reference-contexts: In a multidatabase system when a global query is decomposed, two types of queries [17] are produced. One is the queries against the export schemas that are derived by translating the local schemas of the underlying databases into a canonical data model, the other is the post-processing queries <ref> [3] </ref> that combine the results returned by the LDBMSs (i.e., the partial results). Most of the previous work on global query processing has concentrated on producing a static execution plan for post-processing queries based on cost estimations.

Reference-contexts: Although the query optimization is performed in parallel, this algorithm produces only serial query execution plans. Furthermore, the algorithm does not consider the plans with bushy inners. In <ref> [11] </ref>, a technique is suggested to reduce query response time in multidatabase systems. In this paper, the authors propose an algorithm that first produces an optimal left deep join tree and then reduces the response time using simple tree transformations. <p> The overhead incurred by these algorithms are O (n 2 ), n being the number of nodes in the query graph. The algorithms do not guarantee that the resulting tree is optimal with respect to the total response time <ref> [11] </ref>. The algorithm that produces left deep join trees does not consider the bushy inners. The tree transformation algorithms suggested in [11] try to reduce the response time by finding cost reducing bushy inners. <p> The algorithms do not guarantee that the resulting tree is optimal with respect to the total response time <ref> [11] </ref>. The algorithm that produces left deep join trees does not consider the bushy inners. The tree transformation algorithms suggested in [11] try to reduce the response time by finding cost reducing bushy inners. However, since they start with a left deep join tree, they may miss the least costly bushy inners. In [12, 13, 14], a cost based query optimization strategy is given. <p> The scheduling algorithm implementing the dynamic query optimization is given in [20]. 5 Performance Evaluation In this section, performance comparisons of the proposed optimization technique with the two most related techniques are presented. The first algorithm <ref> [11] </ref> (Hybrid Algorithm) tries to reduce the response time by tree balancing. And the second algorithm [12, 13, 14] tries to maximize the parallelism in execution by considering the parameters stemming from the nature of multidatabases. <p> An intersite operation is scheduled if the value of its weight function does not exceed the threshold. The performance results show that the proposed technique is an effective one and performs better than the algorithm given in <ref> [11] </ref>. Although the proposed technique performs almost the same as the technique given in [13, 14], it does not require costly operations such as database calibration.

Reference-contexts: Most of the previous work on global query processing has concentrated on producing a static execution plan for post-processing queries based on cost estimations. Some systems like Garlic <ref> [16] </ref>, however, have looked at optimization for the entire query, not just the post-processing part. Due to local loads and autonomy of the local database systems, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to do a detailed cost-based query optimization.

Reference-contexts: Communication cost and conversion cost for intermediate results are taken to be proportional to the sizes of intermediate results. The left deep tree used as the initial input for the Hybrid Algorithm is obtained as in R* <ref> [18] </ref>. 6 In the second phase of the experiments the effect of the deviation of the estimated costs from their actual values is explored. For this purpose, programs are run for five different deviations from the estimations.

Reference-contexts: However, since the difference between a near-optimum and a bad execution plan may be enormous, finding an effective technique for optimizing post-processing queries is essential. Dynamic query optimization technique described in this paper is an attempt in this respect <ref> [19] </ref>. The technique proposed uses the available partial results at run-time without dictating an execution site. In scheduling the intersite operations between the partial results, the conditions between these results should be considered. <p> The GDA object controls and schedules all the intersite operations required for the execution of the global query. 4 Dynamic Query Optimization Since DOM architectures provide location transparent access to the objects, it is necessary to develop query optimization strategies based on this fact. The dynamic query optimization scheme <ref> [19] </ref>, which is a step in this direction, uses the available partial results at run-time, instead of producing an execution plan based on the estimated execution time of subqueries.

Initial appearance times for the partial results are also randomly chosen assuming that the sizes of the partial results are uncorrelated with the appearance times but correlated with the type of the global subquery.
