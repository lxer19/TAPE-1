Abstract: The epipolar parametrization of a surface is obtained by tracking its profiles in a sequence of images with known camera motion. Generally, this does not provide a global reconstruction and depends on the camera trajectory. This paper gives a systematic way of detecting the gaps left by the reconstruction process. We present an investigation of epipolar curves on the object surface and in a related `spatio-temporal surface'. The epipo-lar curve has a cusp and the epipolar parametrization breaks down where the epipolar plane is tangent to the surface. This parametrization also breaks down where the epipolar curve is tangent to the critical set. A description is given for the geometry of all of the generic cases where the epipo-lar parametrization breaks down.

Reference-contexts: The epipolar plane is the plane spanned by this ray and the tangent to the curve c of centers. In practice the epipolar plane is computed from a visual ray to one camera center and the baseline connecting the two centers <ref> [3, p.170] </ref>. On the surface M an epipolar curve through r is defined as one whose tangent is along the visual ray as shown in Fig. 1. As c moves with time, the visual ray slips along the epipolar curve.

Reference-contexts: Definition 2.1 The surface f M defined by (r (u; v) c (t)) n (u; v) = 0 (2) is called the spatio-temporal surface. It is associated with M and the motion c of the camera center. Compare <ref> [4] </ref>. There is a natural projection : f M ! M given by (u; v; t) = r (u; v). Thus f M can be regarded as the union of the critical sets on M , spread out in the t-direction.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper is concerned with some aspects of the reconstruction of a smooth surface M from a sequence of profiles (also called apparent contours, outlines and occluding contours) where the motion of the observer is known. Such a reconstruction was introduced in <ref> [6] </ref> for a simple class of motions, and was generalised in [1, 2, 15] to arbitrary motion. For the general motion case, the epipolar correspondence (as in stereo) played an important role in matching points from one profile to the next.

Reference-contexts: Second, the critical sets themselves can become singular (having an isolated point or a crossing). A more complete version of this paper will appear in [8], and some of the results have appeared in <ref> [7] </ref>. 2 Critical sets and the spatio-temporal surface Let M be a smooth surface in 3-space, without boundary, and let c (t) and r be as above. We use n to denote the unit (say outward) normal at r.

Reference-contexts: So this parametrization is the best one to choose if one uses the pseudo-intersection of viewlines as an approximation to the surface. In <ref> [8] </ref> we show that there is only one other parametrization besides the epipolar one for which this holds. The epipolar curves on M have the striking property that their osculating planes are precisely epipolar planes. <p> Second, the critical sets themselves can become singular (having an isolated point or a crossing). A more complete version of this paper will appear in <ref> [8] </ref>, and some of the results have appeared in [7]. 2 Critical sets and the spatio-temporal surface Let M be a smooth surface in 3-space, without boundary, and let c (t) and r be as above. We use n to denote the unit (say outward) normal at r. <p> The line of cusps is where the epipolar curves and critical sets are tangent. Typically, the profile ends at these points. The line of cusps forms part of the natural boundary, where the surface profile is occluded. The other part of the natural boundary is associated with T-junctions <ref> [8] </ref>. 4 Conclusion The epipolar parametrization of a surface M has been shown elsewhere to be very useful in the reconstruction process.

Reference-contexts: For orthographic projection, motion in any plane P has stationary frontier points where the tangent plane to M is parallel to P . This is used by Ku-tulakos and Dyer <ref> [10] </ref> for producing a set of stationary points.

Reference-contexts: Note that the frontier curve can be reconstructed by triangulation. Once one has determined where the frontier and natural boundary curves are, there are three ways to fill in the gaps. As in <ref> [11] </ref>, one can actively move the camera to a trajectory that will reconstruct some missing parts of the surface (if this is possible). One could also apply different sensors or use information from surface markings and texture (as in multiframe stereo).

Reference-contexts: A third approach is to use other information which is implicitly present in the profiles. The profile of a surface from a given view determines a bound ing cone. The intersection of these cones from different viewpoints can be used to construct the bounding volume for an object <ref> [12, 13] </ref>. Merging of the appropriate pieces of these two surfaces along the frontier and the natural boundary can produce a closed surface which uses all of the information available from the profiles.

Reference-contexts: It is this `epipolar parametrization' of M which is used in [1, 2] to reconstruct M from its profiles, which are the images of the critical sets in a viewplane or viewsphere. In <ref> [14] </ref> it is shown that reconstruction from the epipolar parametrization is readily transformable into an optimal estimation problem.
