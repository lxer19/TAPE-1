Abstract: In network multimedia applications, such as multiparty teleconferencing, users often need to send the same information to several (but not necessarily all) other users. To manage such one-to-many or many-to-many communication efficiently in wide-area internetworks, it is imperative to support and perform multicast routing. Multicast routing sends a single copy of a message from a source to multiple receivers over a communication link that is shared by the paths to the receivers. Loop-freedom is a specially important consideration in multicasting. Because applications using multicasting tend to be multimedia and bandwidth intensive, and loops in multicast routing duplicates looping packets. We present a new multicast routing protocol, called Multicast Internet Protocol (MIP), which offers a simple and flexible approach to constructing both group-shared and shortest-paths multicast trees. MIP can be sender-initiated or receiver-initiated or both; therefore, it can be tailored to the particular nature of an application's group dynamics and size. MIP is independent of the underlying unicast routing algorithms used. MIP is robust and adapts under dynamic network conditions (topology or link cost changes) to maintain loop-free multicast routing. Under stable network conditions, MIP has no maintenance or control message overhead. Keywords: multicast routing, distributed algorithms

Reference-contexts: This complicates inter-domain multicasting if the domains involved use different unicast routing. The unicast routing also becomes more complicated by incorporating the multicast-related requirements. To overcome the above shortcomings, two protocols have been recently proposed: the core-based tree (CBT) architecture <ref> [1] </ref> and the protocol independent multicast (PIM) architecture [5].

Reference-contexts: The assumption of a diffusing computation is that a query and its reply travel reliably from one router to its neighbor. However, in an internetwork, MIP would have to run on top of an unreliable datagram delivery service such as that provided by IP or UDP <ref> [2] </ref>. Accordingly, MIP provides its own retransmissions of queries and replies to ensure that they are exchanged reliably between neighbor routers.

Reference-contexts: The source does not need to know the addresses of the individual members of the group. Any sender can send to a group, whether or not it is a member of the group. The number and location of members in a group can be arbitrary and dynamic. IGMP <ref> [3] </ref> or a similar protocol is assumed for the routers to monitor the presence of group members on their attached subnetworks and to propagate and exchange multicast information.

Reference-contexts: Multi-casting can benefit a wide array of network applications, including multiparty video or audio teleconferencing, collaborative environments, replicated databases, resource discovery, and parallel processing. Multicasting is supported in local area networks (LANs) using hardware technologies. Recently, multicasting has been extended to internetworks by Deering <ref> [4] </ref>. Based on Deering's work and built into the TCP/IP protocol suite, the internet group message protocol (IGMP) is used to disseminate multicast membership information to multicast routers. Deering's method permits routers to dynamically determine how to forward messages. A delivery tree is constructed on-demand and is data-driven. <p> Sections 3 through 7 describe MIP in detail, provide examples of its operation, and present a formal specification. Section 9 compares the performance of MIP with the performance of PIM. 2 OVERVIEW OF MIP 2.1 Multicast model Like CBT and PIM, MIP adopts the host group multicast model <ref> [4] </ref>, used in the existing IP architecture. The model defines the service interface to the users of an internetwork.

Reference-contexts: PIM is based on the notion of soft state, which requires routers in a multicast tree to refresh their membership in the tree periodically (e.g., every 60 seconds, the suggested default value <ref> [6] </ref>). In contrast, MIP is based on diffusing computations [7, 8], which means that every computation started by a router to create and maintain a multicast tree is propagated to other routers as needed using a recursive query-response mechanism. <p> A shared tree is constructed with router 24 being the root and RP of MIP and PIM, respectively. For PIM, the timers are set to 60 seconds, which is the suggested default value for the Join/Prune refresh interval in PIM's specification <ref> [6] </ref>. For MIP, the receiver-initiated tree creation mode is used. The link delays are assumed to be the same in both directions. The network is lightly loaded, so that the link-delays and processing time is very small (compared to 60 seconds).

Reference-contexts: A delivery tree is constructed on-demand and is data-driven. The tree in the existing IP architecture is the reverse shortest-path tree and shortest-path tree from the source to the group for distance-vector (i.e., DVMRP [11]) and link-state routing (i.e., MOSPF <ref> [9] </ref>), respectively. For example, the Multicast Backbone (MBone) in today's Internet consists of a set of routers running DVMRP. However, there are several shortcomings with the existing IP multicast architecture, i.e., DVMRP and MOSPF.

A major limitation of CBT is that it constructs only a single tree per group and thus provides longer end-to-end delays than would be obtained along a shortest-path tree. <p> An important limitation of PIM is that the periodic control messages, i.e., its soft-state mechanism, incur overhead even in a stable internet. Both protocols have been shown to suffer from temporary loops resulting from the use of inconsistent unicast routing information <ref> [10] </ref>, and neither protocol has been verified to provide correct multicast routing trees after network changes. We present a new multicast routing protocol called Multicast Internet Protocol (MIP), which solves the shortcomings of the previous approaches to multicast routing.
