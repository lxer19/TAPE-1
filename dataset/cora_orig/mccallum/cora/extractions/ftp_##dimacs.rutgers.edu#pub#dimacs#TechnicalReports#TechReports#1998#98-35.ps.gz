Reference-contexts: Now if Carole follows the strategy described in Lemma 4.3 in every round she wins G 0 (T n ; k 1 ; : : : ; k r ). 5 Another Interesting Game The game G (n; k; r) is inspired by another game of Shiva Chaudhuri <ref> [1] </ref>. We describe briefly describe this game. Chaudhuri's game C (n; k; r) is played on mesh which is cut into half diagonally (See Figure 3). Hence, there are n levels. Each level i consists of i nodes labeled (i; 1); : : : ; (i; i).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Combinatorial games have been extensively studied <ref> [2] </ref>. The topic of this paper is the investigation of a game G (n; k; r) between two players. Let T n denote a complete binary tree with n levels. Level 0 of T n consists of a single node labeled by, , the empty string.

Reference-contexts: One can easily show that Paul wins U (n; k; r) if and only if 2 kr n: Ulam's game becomes much more interesting if Carole is allowed to lie at times. Very interesting results are obtained for Ulam's searching game with fixed number of lies <ref> [3, 4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: After r rounds, Paul wins if there is a unique paths consistent with Carole's answers. Remark The names Paul and Carole have been suggested by Joel Spencer <ref> [4] </ref> for these type of searching games. Paul after the great Questioner-Paul Erdos. Carole maybe and thought of her acronym -Oracle. It is interesting to contrast G (n; r; k) with the k round version of Ulam's searching game - 2 - [5]. <p> One can easily show that Paul wins U (n; k; r) if and only if 2 kr n: Ulam's game becomes much more interesting if Carole is allowed to lie at times.

Ulam's game is often compared <ref> [4] </ref> with the classical "Twenty Questions." However, few would be willing to play Twenty Questions, if they were required to ask all of the twenty questions at once! What makes Twenty Questions interesting is that "answers do help in posing questions." The game G (n; k; r) turns out to be
