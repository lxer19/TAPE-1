Title: Modeling Internet Topology

Abstract: The topology of a network, or a group of networks such as the Internet, has a strong bearing on many management and performance issues. Good models of the topological structure of a network are essential for developing and analyzing internetworking technology. This article discusses how graph-based models can be used to represent the topology of large networks, particularly aspects of locality and hierarchy present in the Internet. Two implementations that generate networks whose topology resembles that of typical internetworks are described, together with publicly available source code.

Reference-contexts: None of them produce convincingly realistic networks. 2 A Better Method Over the past few years a better method has been devised independently by the authors for generating graphs that reflect the hierarchical domain structure and locality that is present in the Internet <ref> [1, 4] </ref>. Three levels of hierarchy are modeled, corresponding to transit domains, stub domains, and LANs attached to stub nodes. The method constructs the graph piecewise, where the pieces correspond to domains at the different levels in the hierarchy. <p> The GT-ITM release includes the necessary libraries from the Stanford GraphBase (SGB), thus the user need not download or understand this code to generate and analyze graphs. 4 Tiers The second implementation is called `Tiers' <ref> [1] </ref>. In this model, the three levels of hierarchy, or tiers, are referred to as WAN, MAN and LAN levels, corresponding to the transit domains, stub domains and LANs of the basic method. The model does not currently support multiple WANs, thus T = 1.

Reference-contexts: That is, a shortest path found using the routing policy weights will traverse transit domain (s) if and only if the two endpoints are in different domains. The Transit-Stub generation software is written in C, and uses the Stanford GraphBase <ref> [2] </ref> for representation and manipulation of graphs. The GT-ITM release includes the necessary libraries from the Stanford GraphBase (SGB), thus the user need not download or understand this code to generate and analyze graphs. 4 Tiers The second implementation is called `Tiers' [1].

Reference-contexts: Some stubs domains may have links to other stubs. Transit domains may themselves be organized in hierarchies, e.g. MANs connect mainly to stubs domains and WANs. 1.2 Existing Topology Models One of the most commonly used models for generating random networks algorithmically is due to Waxman <ref> [3] </ref>. The nodes in the network are placed at random points in a two dimensional grid.
