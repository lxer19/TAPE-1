Title: Case Retrieval Nets Applied to Large Case Bases  
Author: Mario Lenz 
Address: Lindenstr. 54a, 10117 Berlin  
Affiliation: Dept. of Computer Science, Humboldt University Berlin  
Abstract: This article presents some experimental results obtained from applying the Case Retrieval Net approach to large case bases. The obtained results suggest that CRNs can successfully handle case bases larger than considered in other reports.

Reference-contexts: No data set contained missing values. The Travel Agency case base has been included in this report mainly for two reasons: Firstly, it has been used for comparative analyses in a number of previous articles describing other retrieval techniques (e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>). Secondly, the employed similarity metric is more knowledge intensive than for the other data sets.

Reference-contexts: In a nutshell, cases are described as set of Information Entities (IEs) which represent single features of each case. These IEs are connected via similarity links which can be utilized for accessing similar cases to a given query case. For more details see <ref> [9, 4] </ref>. The goal of this article is, however, neither the presentation of details of the CRN approach, nor the detailed discussion of other retrieval methods. <p> Secondly, the employed similarity metric is more knowledge intensive than for the other data sets. Hence, there is a large number of similarity links as described in the CRN model (cf. <ref> [9, 4] </ref>). 3 Tests performed In order to test whether CRNs are able to handle case bases of reasonable size, we performed a number of case retrievals and measured the time required.

Reference-contexts: An example application area is the design of diagnosis and decision support systems ([8]). Here it is crucial that the relevant cases can be rapidly selected from large case bases. To satisfy this requirement, a number of techniques have been proposed recently (see <ref> [5] </ref> for an overview), including indexing schemes ([11]), kd-trees ([13]), the Fish-and-Sink approach ([12]), the Crash memory model ([3]), and Case Retrieval Nets (CRNs). The latter employ net-like memory structures to perform a retrieval similar to information access in an associative memory model.
