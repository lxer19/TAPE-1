Title: New Improved Error Bounds for the Linear Complementarity Problem  
Author: O. L. Mangasarian J. Ren 
Keyword: Key Words: Linear complementarity, error bounds. Abbreviated Title: LCP Error Bounds.  
Abstract: New local and global error bounds are given for both nonmonotone and monotone linear complementarity problems. Comparisons of various residuals used in these error bounds are given. A possible candidate for a "best" error bound emerges from our comparisons as the sum of two natural residuals.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We consider the classical linear complementarity problem <ref> [1, 8] </ref> of finding an x in the n-dimensional real space IR n such that Mx + q 0; x 0; x (Mx + q) = 0; (1) where M 2 IR nfin and q 2 IR n . We denote this problem by LCP (M, q) for short. <p> Another interesting result is to show that the natural residual r (x) is a global error bound not only when M has nonzero principal minors [2, 7], but also for the larger class of M 2 R 0 <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> In this work, we extend further these results to a larger class of matrices. Specifically, we prove that r (x) is a global error bound for R 0 -matrices. This class contains all the other three classes <ref> [1] </ref>. We give a completely different and simpler proof by using a local result [3, 10]. First we define the class of R 0 -matrices [1]. <p> Specifically, we prove that r (x) is a global error bound for R 0 -matrices. This class contains all the other three classes <ref> [1] </ref>. We give a completely different and simpler proof by using a local result [3, 10]. First we define the class of R 0 -matrices [1]. Definition 2.2 A matrix M 2 IR nfin is called an R 0 -matrix if the LCP (M, 0) has zero as its unique solution. Theorem 2.1 Let M 2 IR nfin be an R 0 -matrix. <p> Then there exists a t &gt; 0 such that for any x 2 IR n where x (x) is a closest solution of LCP (M, q) to x under the norm k k. Proof. Since the matrix M is an R 0 -matrix <ref> [1] </ref>, the proof follows from Theorem 2.1. Q.E.D. Remark 2.1 The residual r (x) fails to bound the distance to the solution set of a monotone LCP from any point in general [4].

Reference-contexts: We denote this problem by LCP (M, q) for short. Let the solution set be We assume that X is nonempty. Define two natural residuals <ref> [3, 4, 9] </ref>: r (x) := kx (x M x q) + k (3) s (x) := k (Mx q; x; x (M x + q)) + k; (4) where k k is some norm. <p> Specifically, we prove that r (x) is a global error bound for R 0 -matrices. This class contains all the other three classes [1]. We give a completely different and simpler proof by using a local result <ref> [3, 10] </ref>. First we define the class of R 0 -matrices [1]. Definition 2.2 A matrix M 2 IR nfin is called an R 0 -matrix if the LCP (M, 0) has zero as its unique solution. Theorem 2.1 Let M 2 IR nfin be an R 0 -matrix. <p> In particular choose a fixed solution x such that kx k xk kx k x (x k )k &gt; kr (x k ): (6) Since r (x) is a local error bound <ref> [3, 10] </ref>, it follows that there exist K &gt; 0 and * &gt; 0 such that for all k &gt; K, r (x k ) &gt; *. <p> Then there exists a constant t &gt; 0 such that kx x (x)k t (r (x) + s (x)); (8) Proof. Since r (x) is a local error bound <ref> [3, 10] </ref>, there exist * &gt; 0 and t 1 &gt; 0 such that if r (x) r (x) + s (x) *, then kx x (x)k t 1 r (x) t 1 (r (x) + s (x)): Suppose now that r (x) + s (x) *, then there are following <p> Without loss of generality, let fx k g converge to x fl and s (x fl ) = 0. Therefore x fl is a solution. On the other hand, since r (x) is a local error bound for each LCP (M, q) <ref> [3, 10] </ref>, there exist positive K; * and t such that when k &gt; K, r (x k ) * holds. <p> Therefore, in order to be an error bound, a residual must bound r (x). In addition, since r (x) is a local bound <ref> [3, 10] </ref>, locally r (x) is equivalent to the distance to the solution set. So, this distance is precisely characterized by r (x) at least locally. <p> Then for a fixed solution x, we have kx k xk kx k x (x k )k k (1 + kx k k)l (x k ): (24) Since l (x) is a local error bound by <ref> [3, 10] </ref>, there exist K &gt; 0 and * &gt; 0 such that l (x k ) &gt; *, for k &gt; K (See proof of Theorem 2.1).

Define two natural residuals <ref> [3, 4, 9] </ref>: r (x) := kx (x M x q) + k (3) s (x) := k (Mx q; x; x (M x + q)) + k; (4) where k k is some norm. <p> A principal result of this paper is to show that r (x)+s (x) bounds the distance to the solution set of the monotone LCP from any point when multiplied by an appropriate condition constant. This is a better result than that in <ref> [4] </ref> because it also serves as a local error bound for the nonmonotone cases and in addition it does not contain a square root term. We also show that r (x) + s (x) is a global error bound for classes of LCPs that are larger than the monotone cases. <p> Proof. Since the matrix M is an R 0 -matrix [1], the proof follows from Theorem 2.1. Q.E.D. Remark 2.1 The residual r (x) fails to bound the distance to the solution set of a monotone LCP from any point in general <ref> [4] </ref>. However, we do not know whether Theorem 2.1 holds for M beyond the class of R 0 -matrices. We suspect that the answer is no. <p> This is an open question. As the first part of Remark 2.1 indicates, in order to obtain a global error bound for the monotone LCP, other types of residuals are required. The residual s (x) is one such suitable residual. Mangasarian and Shiau <ref> [4] </ref> established the first global error bound for the monotone LCP by using s (x) + s (x) 1 2 . In addition Mangasarian has further showed that s (x) itself is a global error bound for a special class of LCPs [5]. <p> Q.E.D. Corollary 2.2 Let LCP (M,q) is monotone. Then r (x) + s (x) is a global error bound for LCP (M, q). Proof. Since s (x) + s (x) 1 2 is a global error bound <ref> [4] </ref>, then, by Theorem 2.2, r (x) + s (x) is also a global error bound. Q.E.D. In fact, There are LCPs where r (x) + s (x) is a global error bound, but s (x) + s (x) 1 2 is not.

In addition Mangasarian has further showed that s (x) itself is a global error bound for a special class of LCPs <ref> [5] </ref>. However, there are examples which show that either s (x) or s (x) 1 2 by itself cannot serve as error bounds for the monotone LCP. Also r (x) itself is not an error bound.

Reference-contexts: This is a major drawback of this type of global error bounds. There are similar cases in <ref> [6] </ref>. 4 Conclusion We conclude by summarizing our error bound relationships in Table 1, where the following defini tions have been used: r (x) := kx (x M x q) + k t (x) := k (M x q; x) + ; i=1 psd := positive semi-definite pd := positive definite
