Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction This manual describes the Ada binding to the SAFENET Lightweight Application Services. The binding consists of several Ada package specifications which contain data types and subprograms that provide the lightweight service primitives described in chapter four of reference <ref> [1] </ref>. This manual describes the services provided by each Ada package in terms of the data types and subprograms defined therein. Portions of this report were prepared while one of the authors (Jeff Michel) was in residence at the Software Engineering Institute in July 1992. 2.

Reference-contexts: However, the length of the physical address must conform to that of the address type it contains if the physical address is to be valid. In accordance with chapter 5 of reference <ref> [2] </ref>, a MAC address must be six bytes long (section 5.2.6), a network address must be 20 bytes long (section 5.2.4), and a transport address must be four bytes long (section 5.2.3.3). 1.

Reference-contexts: Unless stated otherwise, semantics that apply to an Ada task also apply to the main programs thread of control. For brevity, the discussion is in terms of tasks. 2. A provision for bounding blocking is provided in Appendix A of reference <ref> [3] </ref>. 8 receiving primitive will not deliver the data sent in the sending primitive until either the receivers data buffer is full, or the connection closes. For sending unitdata and transaction primitives, the END_OF_MESSAGE component has a no semantic effect.

Reference-contexts: The CONNECTION_PARAMETERS, MESSAGE_OPTIONS, and UNITDATA_ OPTIONS types are used in various primitives to allow an application access to parameters of the underlying transport service provider, the Xpress Transfer Protocol. Many of the parameters map directly to XTP protocol parameters listed in Figure 2-6 of reference <ref> [4] </ref>. Others map indirectly to protocol options found in the XTP header. For complete descriptions of the semantics of these protocol parameters and options, see references [4] and [5]. The correspondence of the Ada binding protocol parameters to XTP parameters and options is given by the table below. <p> Many of the parameters map directly to XTP protocol parameters listed in Figure 2-6 of reference <ref> [4] </ref>.
