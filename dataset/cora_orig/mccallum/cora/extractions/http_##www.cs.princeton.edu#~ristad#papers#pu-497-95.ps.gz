Title: Effect of Speed on Handwriting Shape: A Descriptive Generalization 1  
Author: Eric Sven Ristad 
Keyword: handwriting, motor complexity, speed-accuracy tradeoff.  
Abstract: Research Report CSTR-497-95 August 1995 Abstract In this report, we characterize the natural simplifying transformations of a handwritten curve. We argue that the number and type of singularities in a geometric curve determine the amount of time required for the human handwriting system to produce that curve to a given level of accuracy. Therefore, the behavior of the human handwriting system under increasing time pressure may be characterized by a set of stochastic transformations that replace costly curve segments with less costly segments, or remove segments entirely.

Reference-contexts: The wrist saccade is not a biomechanical necessity. It is all the more interest 3 ing because it is at odds with elementary school handwriting instruction, which encourages writers to maintain a constant rightward wrist velocity <ref> [1] </ref>. The wrist saccade appears to arise primarily from the writer's conceptualization of the handwriting task as organized into a hierarchy of linguistic subtasks: the utterance, the word, and the character. The wrist saccade marks the completion of one complex motor task and the initiation of the next task.
