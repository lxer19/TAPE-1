Abstract: The dynamics/computation debate recalls a similar debate in the evolutionary biology community concerning the relative primacy of theories of structure versus theories of change. I argue that a full account of cognition will require a rapprochement between such theories, and will include both computational and dynamical notions. The key to making computation relevant to cognition is not making it analog, but rather understanding how functional information-processing structures can emerge in complex dynamical systems. Is cognition about change or is it about structure? Van Gelder clearly thinks that change is the essence: he champions dynamical systems theory because "Dynamicists are interested, in the first instance, in how things change; states are the medium of change, and have little intrinsic interest. Computationalists, by contrast, focus primarily on states; change is just what takes you from one state to another....Computationalists focus on internal structure...." (p. 10) Van Gelder's formulation of this opposition|between dynamics as focused on state change and computation as focused on state internal structure|brings to mind a similar debate that has gone on for years in the evolutionary biology community, and whose resolution will, I believe, be instructive for the dynamics/computation debate in cogntive science. What accounts for the particular biological phenomena that we observe in the world? The predominant explanatory framework has been neo-Darwinism, a theory of change par excellence (inherited random change from one generation to the next leads to adaptation via natural selection). But some evolutionary theorists have questioned the adequacy of classical neo-Darwinism as either an explanatory or a predictive theory, and argue instead for the primacy of historical contingency (Gould, 1989a) or the self-organization of biological structure not due to natural selection (Fontana & Buss, 1994; Goodwin, 1990; Kauffman, 1993). These "historicists" and "structuralists" are the connectionists of the evolutionary biology community|the people questioning the classical orthodoxy. The selection-ist/historicist/structuralist debate was summarized by Seilacher in his triangle of causal

Reference-contexts: What's needed is a theory that incorporates both change and structure 1 . Similarly, in cognitive science, we have theories of change and movement ("dynamical" approaches): how robots walk in a stable manner <ref> (Beer, 1995) </ref>, how babies reach and grasp (Thelen & Smith, 1994), how people move from a condition of uncertainty to making a decision (Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993).

These theories, however, do not explain the information-processing content of the states over which change is occurring; they either address tasks that don't require complex information processing or assume high-level information-related primitives a priori. <p> For example, in Busemeyer and Townsend's Decision Field Theory, described in the target article, information-loaded notions such as "positive and negative consequences", "attention and shift of attention", "preferences", and "motivation" are atomic primitives <ref> (Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993) </ref>, and the theory does not attempt to explain how these are implemented or why a particular decision-maker might have one version of them instead of another.

Reference-contexts: As van Gelder points out, most of these theories assume that information processing consists of the manipulation of explicit, static symbols rather than the autonomous interaction of emergent, active ones <ref> (Hofstadter, 1985) </ref>. Such theories typically cannot explain what driving forces and constraints there are on how the system in question can change, what trajectories it can take, and how the high-level symbols can emerge from a lower-level substrate.

It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that the stark oppositions posited among these three frameworks are not only false oppositions, but are hindering progress in evolutionary theory.
