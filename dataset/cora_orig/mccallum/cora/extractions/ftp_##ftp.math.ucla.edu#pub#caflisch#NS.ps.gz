Abstract: This is the second of two papers on the zero-viscosity limit for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a half-space in either 2D or 3D. Under the assumption of analytic initial data, we construct solutions of Navier-Stokes for a short time which is independent of the viscosity. The Navier-Stokes solution is constructed through a composite asymptotic expansion involving the solutions of the Euler and Prandtl equations, which were constructed in the first paper, plus an error term. This shows that the Navier-Stokes solution goes to an Euler solution outside a boundary layer and to a solution of the Prandtl equations within the boundary layer. The error term is written as a sum of first order Euler and Prandtl corrections plus a further error term. The equation for the error term is weakly nonlinear; its linear part is the time dependent Stokes equation. This error equation is solved by inversion of the Stokes equation, through expressing the solution as a regular (Euler-like) part plus a boundary layer (Prandtl-like) part. The main technical tool in this analysis is the Abstract Cauchy-Kowalewski Theorem.

Reference-contexts: This result suggest further work on several related problems: Analysis of the zero-viscosity limit for Navier-Stokes equations in the exterior of a ball is presented in <ref> [1] </ref>. An alternative derivation of this result may be possible by a more direct analysis of the Navier-Stokes solution. In two-dimensions, a solution is known to exist for a time that is independent of the viscosity.

Reference-contexts: The initial data were assumed to be analytic: although this restriction is severe, we believe that it might be optimal. In fact separation of the boundary layer is related to development of a singularity in the solution of the time-dependent Prandtl equations, as discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>. We conjecture that the time of separation (and thus the singularity time) cannot be controlled by a Sobolev bound on the initial data, unless some positivity and monotonicity is assumed as in [5].

Reference-contexts: There are several other ways to represent the Navier-Stokes solution for small viscosity. The most common method in perturbation theory <ref> [3] </ref> is to write the solution as a matched asymptotic expansion in which u NS = u P + O (") for y small enough (2.28) u NS = u E + O (") for y not too small: (2.29) The formal validity of this representation is usually demonstrated by showing

Reference-contexts: While this representation is more easily understood than the composite expansion, it is much more difficult to rigorously analyze due to the two spatial regimes. A second method for representing the solution, which has been used for example in <ref> [4, 8] </ref>, is to introduce a cut off function m = m (y=" ff ) with m (0) = 1, m (1) = 0, and 0 &lt; ff &lt; 1.

Reference-contexts: We conjecture that the time of separation (and thus the singularity time) cannot be controlled by a Sobolev bound on the initial data, unless some positivity and monotonicity is assumed as in <ref> [5] </ref>. It would be very important to verify this by an explicit singularity construction, or to refute it by an existence theorem in Sobolev spaces for Prandtl.

Reference-contexts: In the zero-viscosity limit, we show that this Navier-Stokes solution goes to an Euler solution outside a boundary layer and to a solution of the Prandtl equations within the boundary layer. As argued in the Introduction of Part I <ref> [6] </ref>, we believe that the imposition of analyticity is needed to make this problem well-posed, by preventing boundary layer separation, but there is no proof of this. In the first paper [6], we proved short time existence of solutions for the Euler equations and the Prandtl equations with analytic initial data. <p> As argued in the Introduction of Part I <ref> [6] </ref>, we believe that the imposition of analyticity is needed to make this problem well-posed, by preventing boundary layer separation, but there is no proof of this. In the first paper [6], we proved short time existence of solutions for the Euler equations and the Prandtl equations with analytic initial data. In this second paper, we construct the Navier-Stokes solution as a sum of the Euler solution, the Prandtl solution and an error term. <p> The error equation is weakly nonlinear, since its solution is small. Its linear part is exactly the time-dependent Stokes equation, with forcing terms and with boundary and initial data. As for the solution of the Euler equations in <ref> [6] </ref>, the incompressibility of the solution is ensured by use of the projection method in order to avoid dealing directly with the pressure. The main technical tool here is the Abstract Cauchy-Kowalewski (ACK) Theorem, which is invoked to establish existence for the error equation. <p> This condition is equivalent to the existence of an intermediate region (e.g. a region where y = O (" ff ) with 0 &lt; ff &lt; 1), where there is a smooth transition between the viscous and inviscid regimes. As already noticed (see Subsection 5.2 of <ref> [6] </ref>), it is natural to introduce the new variable ~ u P defined as ~u P = u P flu E (2.18) x = 0 and write Prandtl equations in terms of ~u P as (@ t @ Y Y ) ~u P + ~u P @ x flu E + <p> 1) ! 0 (2.22) 0 (x; Y ) flu E 0 : (2.23) We also define the normal velocity v P to be the velocity ~v P minus its value at infinity; i.e. v P (Y ) = ~v P (Y ) ~v P (Y = 1) = Y In <ref> [6] </ref> we have proved that, under suitable hypotheses on the initial conditions, i.e. analyticity, incompressibility and compatibility with boundary conditions, both the Euler and Prandtl equations admit a unique solution in the appropriate space of analytic functions (see Theorems 4.1 and 5.1 in [6]). <p> P (Y = 1) = Y In <ref> [6] </ref> we have proved that, under suitable hypotheses on the initial conditions, i.e. analyticity, incompressibility and compatibility with boundary conditions, both the Euler and Prandtl equations admit a unique solution in the appropriate space of analytic functions (see Theorems 4.1 and 5.1 in [6]). To be more specific, we found the existence and the uniqueness of an analytic solution for Euler equations which is L 2 in both the x and y variable. <p> Let us consider f 1 .

(4.7)-(4.10) is somewhat similar to the structure of Euler equations and the proof of the above theorem closely follows the proof of Theorem 4.1 in <ref> [6] </ref>.

The first term in this expression provides the correct initial data, the second term the correct boundary data, and the third term the correct forcing terms.
