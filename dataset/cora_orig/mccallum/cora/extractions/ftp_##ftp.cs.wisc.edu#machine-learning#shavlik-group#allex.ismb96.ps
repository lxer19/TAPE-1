Abstract: Virtually all large-scale sequencing projects use automatic sequence-assembly programs to aid in the determination of DNA sequences. The computer-generated assemblies require substantial handediting to transform them into submissions for GenBank. As the size of sequencing projects increases, it becomes essential to improve the quality of the automated assemblies so that this time-consuming handediting may be reduced. Current ABI sequencing technology uses base calls made from fluorescently-labeled DNA fragments run on gels. We present a new representation for the fluorescent trace data associated with individual base calls. This representation can be used before, during, and after fragment assembly to improve the quality of assemblies. We demonstrate one such use end-trimming of suboptimal data that results in a significant improvement in the quality of subsequent assemblies.

Reference-contexts: The current causes the migration of sub-fragments through the gel. Since smaller pieces of DNA migrate more quickly than larger ones, the sub-fragments become separated by size. The fluorescent labeling then provides the means for determination of the fragment sequence <ref> (Ansorge et al. 1986, Smith et al. 1986) </ref>. The ABI sequencer reads the intensity trace of each of the four fluorescent dyes as the sub-fragments migrate past. This process is called reading the trace, and the data produced is called trace data.

Reference-contexts: Seqman sequence-assembly software. In this program, sequences are added one at a time to contigs. New sequences are compared against the consensus of each existing contig.

Bad data adds many ambiguous and incorrect base calls to, or poisons, the consensus for its contig and may prevent subsequent sequences from being added to the contig (McCombie & Martin-Gallardo 1994).

Reference-contexts: Although we have had success in using it as described, we believe that it can be enriched to make it more powerful. Relative intensities and relative separations among peaks have been identified as important features in patterns of DNA sequences <ref> (Golden, Torgersen & Tibbetts 1993, Tibbetts, Bowling & Golden 1994) </ref>. We will study the merit of incorporation of these features in our representation.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the sequencer makes a no-call and labels the base with an N. The goal is to obtain the exact sequence of bases that is the complement of the fragment. In practice, the accuracy of the base calls made by modern sequencers is 98-99% <ref> (Chen 1994, Kelley 1994) </ref>. A sequence of base calls and corresponding trace data is depicted in Figure 2. <p> In fact, this is rarely the case. Difficulties inherent in the preparation and sequencing of fragments lead to incorrect base calls. Also, the quality of the trace data becomes progressively worse near the end of the fragment. Many more incorrect calls and no-calls are in this region <ref> (Kelley 1994, Perkin Elmer 1995) </ref>. <p> To demonstrate the value of our representation, we next describe a method that successfully uses base tracedata classifications in an important pre-assembly step. Case Study: End-Trimming The quality of the trace data, and therefore the base calls, decreases dramatically as the read through a gel progresses <ref> (Kelley 1994) </ref>. In good data, peaks are sharp, well-defined, and scaled high (Perkin Elmer 1995). Figure 10 shows a set of trace data as it progresses from good to nearly useless. <p> The absolute cutoff method trims sequence data after a userspecified number of bases. Often with ABI data, the number of bases is about 500 this is based on the observation that the quality of trace data generally deteriorates after 500 bases <ref> (Kelley 1994) </ref>. Given this information, data from base 500 to the end of the sequence is trimmed off the sequence. Although trimming the data after 500 base calls is reasonable, the problem is that sometimes good data is trimmed away while at other times poor data is kept.

Reference-contexts: The set is complementary since it is generated through replication using polymerase and a primer. At each replication step deoxynucleotides (A, G, C, and T) and dideoxynucleotides (A*, G*, C*, and T*) compete for addition to the growing sequence. Deoxynucleotides permit elongation whereas dideoxynucleotides terminate replication <ref> (Prober et al. 1987) </ref>. The result is a set of sub-fragments that encompasses all possible lengths (except those of the initial primer).

Reference-contexts: The sequence of bases can be thought of as a string over an alphabet of four symbols: A , G, C, and T. Algorithms for matching and aligning strings have been wellstudied in computer science and can be applied to problems in DNA sequencing <ref> (Waterman 1989, Kruskal 1983) </ref>. One critical application involves the alignment of overlapping sequences of bases among DNA fragments; this process is called sequence assembly. The sequences of bases used for assembly are determined by an examination of the fluorescent-dye intensity signal, called trace data, that is output by automatic sequencers.
