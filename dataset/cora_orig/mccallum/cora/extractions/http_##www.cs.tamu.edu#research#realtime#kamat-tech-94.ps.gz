Abstract: In this paper, we study the performance of FDDI networks in terms of their guarantee probability, i.e., the probability that a set of synchronous messages are guaranteed to meet their deadlines. Traditional techniques such as queuing analysis cannot be directly used to derive the guarantee probability. To counter this problem, we develop a new geometric model of schedulability. Based on this model, we obtain a numerical method to compute the exact values of the guarantee probability. A closed-form approximation for the guarantee probability is also derived, and is shown to be relatively accurate and computationally efficient. The network performance is then systematically examined in terms of the guarantee probability. We find that there is a high probability that a randomly chosen message set can be guaranteed even when the real-time traffic is increased beyond the worst case achievable utilization bound. Hence, FDDI networks are applicable for real-time applications in a wide range of loading conditions.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper we investigate the performance of the FDDI network for real-time communications. With the growing use of distributed hard real-time systems, the ability of computer networks to handle real-time traffic is becoming increasingly important. The fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) <ref> [3] </ref> is an ANSI standard for a 100 Mbit/s fiber optic token ring designed to support both real-time synchronous traffic and conventional asynchronous traffic. FDDI uses the timed token protocol [5] to regulate access to the channel. <p> Consequently, asynchronous messages are only sent by a node if the token arrived earlier than expected. Thus, a fixed portion of the network bandwidth is reserved for synchronous messages, and the remainder can be used for the transmission of asynchronous messages. The reader is referred to <ref> [3] </ref> for further details regarding the protocol operation. We denote the token walk time by t . The token walk time, t , includes the node-to-node delay and the token transmission time. Hence, t is the portion of TTRT that is not available for message transmission. <p> The bit delay per node was taken to be 75 bits, and the signal propagation speed through the medium was assumed to be 75% of the speed of light. The frame length for asynchronous messages (used to compute the maximum amount of asynchronous overrun, see <ref> [3] </ref> for details) was taken to be 512 bits (64 bytes) with an overhead of 118 bits.

Regions W 2 and W 3 = W 1 " W 2 may be more complicated than they were in this paper, mainly due to the complexity of the schedulability criteria. Nevertheless, they should be Lebesgue-measurable.

Also, during D i time units, D i P i C i can loosely be regarded as the load on node i. <p> The following lemma establishes a useful relationship between these two constraints. LEMMA 3.1 When the synchronous bandwidths are allocated according to (12), meeting the protocol constraint is sufficient to satisfy the deadline constraint <ref> [14] </ref>. This property considerably simplifies the analysis of the guarantee probability, because we only need be concerned with the protocol constraint. Now, H i TTRT is the fraction of network bandwidth allocated to node i. <p> Figure 6 shows that for the same difference between average periods and deadlines, the performance is better when the average deadline is higher. * There is a very high probability of guaranteeing message sets even when the utilization is increased beyond the worst case achievable utilization (which is approximately 0:33 <ref> [14] </ref>). This shows that the average performance of FDDI networks is much better than that predicted by the worst case figure. Hence, FDDI is suitable for use in real-time systems over a wide range of loading conditions. <p> The allocation scheme defined by (12) is valid for D i P i . For a synchronous message stream, if D i &lt; P i then the allocation of its synchronous bandwidth should be modified as below (see <ref> [14] </ref> for details): H i = b D i TTRT 1c : (39) The rationale for this modification is as follows: In a time interval of length D i , the token will visit node i at least b D i TTRT 1c times. <p> This results in (39). With this modification, satisfaction of the protocol constraint is still sufficient to ensure schedulability. Thus, GP (U ) = F A (U) (1 ff) still holds. However, as noted in <ref> [14] </ref>, in this case it is more appropriate to define the utilization of a message stream with deadline smaller than its period as U i = C i D i . The method used for obtaining F A (U) remains the same as before with this modification.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge of the guarantee probability is very useful, because it embodies both the average case and the worst case real-time performance of a network. Unfortunately, obtaining the guarantee probability can be very difficult. Network performance evaluation has traditionally been conducted using queuing theory <ref> [15] </ref>. For our real-time synchronous communication problem, queuing theory might be able to yield performance measures such as the average message delay, though the analysis would be complicated due to the periodic arrivals. Nevertheless, queuing theory is not appropriate for obtaining the guarantee probability.
