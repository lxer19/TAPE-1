Title: A Neural Network Model for Prognostic Prediction  
Author: W. Nick Street 
Address: Stillwater, OK 74078  
Affiliation: Computer Science Department Oklahoma State University  
Abstract: An important and difficult prediction task in many domains, particularly medical decision making, is that of prognosis. Prognosis presents a unique set of problems to a learning system when some of the outputs are unknown. This paper presents a new approach to prognostic prediction, using ideas from nonparametric statistics to fully utilize all of the available information in a neural architecture. The technique is applied to breast cancer prognosis, resulting in flexible, accurate models that may play a role in prevent ing unnecessary surgeries.

Reference-contexts: However, removing the nodes for examination leaves the arm subject to infection and possible lymphedema (Aitken et al., 1989), and does not affect overall survival <ref> (Abe et al., 1995) </ref>. In both of our test cases, the separation with this method represents an improvement over that achieved by the lymph node status feature. Further, statistically significant separation was achieved in both data sets without using the lymph feature (WPBC, p = 0.02; SEER, p &lt; 0.001).

Reference-contexts: In traditional breast cancer staging, postoperative treatment decisions are based largely or even entirely on whether or not the cancer has spread to the patient's axillary lymph nodes.

In both of our test cases, the separation with this method represents an improvement over that achieved by the lymph node status feature.

Reference-contexts: Their computational results are verified only by demonstrating that their predicted survival rates closely approximate those of the test cases. The problem has also been approached in an unsupervised learning fashion, using clustering <ref> (Bradley et al., 1997) </ref> and self-organizing neural networks (Schenone et al., 1993). However, these techniques did not directly address the problem of prediction using censored data. While this research also separates the cases into classes based on recurrence time, it differs from the above techniques in several respects.

Reference-contexts: In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the application of machine learning methods to prediction using censored data. Several groups have approached prognosis as a separation problem using different learning architectures, including backpropagation artificial neural networks (ANNs) (Burke, 1994; Burke et al., 1997), entropy maximization networks <ref> (Choong et al., 1996) </ref> and decision trees (Wolberg et al., 1992; Wolberg et al., 1994).

Reference-contexts: Problems involving censored data are common to several fields. In engineering, one might be interested in the survival characteristics of electronic components, while sociologists might consider what factors lead to long-lasting marriages. These problems have traditionally been approached using statistical techniques such as Cox proportional-hazards regression <ref> (Cox, 1972) </ref>. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the application of machine learning methods to prediction using censored data.

Reference-contexts: Again, a test case is predicted to recur at time t if the activation of output node t is the first one indicating a DFS probability of less than 0.5. The two curves are very similar and show no significant statistical difference (p = 0.2818, generalized Wilcoxon test <ref> (Gehan, 1965) </ref>). disease-free survival curve compared to predicted DFS curve. The predicted group survival for the SEER data did not closely match the actual survival curve.

Reference-contexts: They were similarly trained with values of +1 up to the observed disease-free survival time. The probabilities of DFS for later times were computed using a variation of the standard Kaplan-Meier maximum likelihood approximation to the true population survival rate <ref> (Kaplan and Meier, 1958) </ref>. We define the risk of recurrence at time t &gt; 0 as the conditional probability that a patient will recur at time t, given that they have not recurred up to time t 1. As an example, consider a study containing a total of 20 patients.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper applies artificial neural network classification to the analysis of survival or lifetime data <ref> (Lee, 1992) </ref>, in which the objective can be broadly defined as predicting the future time of a particular event. In this work we are concerned specifically with prognosis, that is, predicting the course of a disease.

Reference-contexts: Collectively, the activation values of the output units represent an expected survival curve for the individual case. If we view the network as learning a survival curve, the task becomes one of function approximation using incomplete data. The training signal is then a modified thermometer encoding <ref> (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989) </ref>, a relatively common encoding for ordered categorical outputs, with the added complication of the survival probabilities for censored cases.

Reference-contexts: us not only separate the cases into "good" and "bad" prognoses, but also to generate predicted survival curves for individual patients, making the system more useful in a clinical setting. 2 Neural Architecture The ANNs used in this work were standard feedfor-ward networks with one hidden layer, trained with backpropagation <ref> (Rumelhart et al., 1986) </ref>. The hyperbolic tangent activation function was used for hidden and output nodes.
