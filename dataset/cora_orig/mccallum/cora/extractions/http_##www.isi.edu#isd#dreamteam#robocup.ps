Abstract: The Robocup 97 competition provides an opportunity to demonstrate the techniques and methods of artificial intelligence, autonomous agents and computer vision. In this competition each of the robots (or agent s) must know how to dribble, shoot, pass, and recover the ball from an opponent. Each agent must also be able to evaluate its position with respect to its teammates and opponents, and then decide whether to wait for a pass, run for the ball, cover an opponent's attack, or go to help a teammate; while at the same time following the rules of the game. The most important feature of the USC/ISI robot soccer team is that every robot is autonomous and self-contained with all of its essential capabilities onboard. There are three types of soccer playing position that a robot can be: goal keeper, defender and forward. The role that a robot plays on the field influences the robots perception of the environment and its playing strategy on the field. While each robot has different motivations and goals, they all share the same general architecture and basic hardware.

Reference-contexts: It stops by disconnecting the move order. The car has the capability to spin in place. There is motor for each wheel which can be controlled independently to enable its quick-turn ability. The control module is a combination of production rules and behavior-based <ref> [2] </ref> systems with each behavior represented as a set of rules [2,3]. The most important problem in this module is counterbalancing the different sources of uncertainty which come to the system from environment and from the system equipment.

Reference-contexts: Since teamwork and individual skills are fundamental factors in the performance of a soccer team, Robocup is an excellent testbed for autonomous agents. For this project we define an autonomous agent as an active physical entity intelligently maneuvering and performing in realistic and challenging surroundings <ref> [4] </ref>. On a soccer field the core capabilities a player must have are to navigate the soccer field, track the ball and other agents, recognize the difference between agents, collaborate with other agents, and hit the ball in the correct direction. <p> There are many techniques in agent modeling and design [1,4]; however, much of the work in this area has focused on agents performing under supervision. We believe that further work should be done in the area of autonomous agents <ref> [4, 5] </ref>, with the capability of autonomous learning and adaptation to the environment. Moreover, agents have to be intelligent enough to cooperate among themselves. A robot consists of a single PC laptop board on a 30cm x 50cm, 4-wheel drive, DC model car (Figure 1).

A team cannot achieve its optimal performance without correct coordination between members of a team. Therefore, it is necessary to power up each agent with proper communication tools to negotiate the future plans with its teammates.

Reference-contexts: Introduction The Robocup task is for a team of multiple fast-moving robots to cooperatively play soccer in a dynamic environment <ref> [6] </ref>. Since teamwork and individual skills are fundamental factors in the performance of a soccer team, Robocup is an excellent testbed for autonomous agents. For this project we define an autonomous agent as an active physical entity intelligently maneuvering and performing in realistic and challenging surroundings [4]. <p> The challenge of inter-agent communication is to implement a robust, noise-free system which can transfer the desire information without any interference. Achieving a high quality teamwork needs a high level of communication <ref> [6] </ref>. We hope to eventually implement a multi-agent communication architecture to provide our robot team with tools to real-time autonomous team collaboration.

Reference-contexts: Our vision system needed to be flexible, robust, and efficient in order to succeed in such a rapidly changing environment as a soccer field. We have chosen to use a commercial onboard digital video camera (the popular QuickCam <ref> [7] </ref>) as the main sensor to implement positioning, collision avoidance, and ball tracking due to its simplicity, robustness, and software availability. To provide a faster reaction to changes in the environment, we use a simple color shape scan of the input frames fed by the camera.
