Abstract: Line drawings provide an effective means of communication about the geometry of 3-D objects. An understanding of how to duplicate the way humans interpret line drawings is extremely important in enabling man-machine communication with respect to images, diagrams, and spatial constructs. In particular, such an understanding could be used to provide the human with the capability to create a line-drawing sketch of a polyhedral object that the machine can automatically convert into the intended 3-D model. A recently published paper (Marill 1991) presented a simple optimization procedure supposedly able to duplicate human judgment in recovering the 3-D "wire frame" geometry of objects depicted in line drawings. Marill provided some impressive examples, but no theoretical justification for his approach. In this paper we introduce our own work by first critically examining Marill's algorithm. We provide an explanation for why Marill's algorithm was able to perform as well as it did on the examples he presented, discuss its weaknesses, and show very simple examples where it fails. We then provide an algorithm that improves on Marill's results. In particular, we show that an effective objective function must favor both symmetry and planarity|Marill deals only with the symmetry issue. By modifying Marill's objective function to explicitly favor planar-faced solutions, and by using a more competent optimization technique, we were able to demonstrate significantly improved performance in all of the examples Marill provided and those additional ones we constructed ourselves. Finally, we examine some questions relevant to the implications of this work for understanding the human ability to interpret line drawings.

Reference-contexts: This is not quite what we would like in the ideal case. Ideally, we would like to find the orthographic extension of the line drawing 10 with the lowest SDA that has exactly planar faces (i.e., for which DP = 0). To achieve this, we use a continuation method <ref> (Leclerc 1989, Witkin et al. 1987) </ref>, which is a sequence of descent steps applied to E (), for decreasing values of . The sequence begins with the initial condition that Marill suggests (z = 0 for all points) and with some initial 0 1.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the costs and benefits of two- versus 3-D interpretations could be assessed. Figures that could be coded more simply under a depth interpretation were, in fact, seen in depth; those that could not be simplified in this way were seen to lie in the picture plane." <ref> (Pomerantz and Kubovy 1981, pp. 439-440) </ref>. Barrow and Tenenbaum (1981) suggested ideas similar to Marill's for interpreting line drawings (both for simple closed curves and polyhedra), but did not pursue the ideas in greater depth.

Reference-contexts: One of the better descent algorithms is the conjugate gradient algorithm. To estimate achievable run times, we implemented the conjugate gradient algorithm described in Numerical Recipes <ref> (Press et al. 1986) </ref>. The algorithm requires an objective function (in this case, E ()) and the gradient of the objective function (in this case, a function that returns a vector whose i th element is the partial derivative of E () with respect to z i ).

Reference-contexts: But in the case of a Blocks World object, competent algorithms exist for finding all the valid completions of the wire frame as a solid polyhedral object <ref> (Strat 1984, Markowsky and Wesley 1981) </ref>. 19 As noted in Appendix A, we have made some initial progress toward the solution of this problem and have developed an algorithmic procedure that can successfully handle all of the examples discussed in this paper, but we recognize that this is still far short

Reference-contexts: More recently, Barnard and Pentland (1983) and Pentland and Kuo (1990) have pursued Barrow and Tenenbaum's approach for 2 Gradient space, originally conceived of by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864 (see <ref> (Whitely 1986) </ref>) and rediscovered by D. A. Huffman, provides only necessary conditions for planar realizability of general polyhedral objects with hidden lines removed, and thus consistent edge labeling is possible for impossible blocks world and Origami objects.
