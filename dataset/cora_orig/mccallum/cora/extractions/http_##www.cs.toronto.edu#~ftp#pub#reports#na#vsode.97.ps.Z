Abstract: Compared to standard numerical methods for initial value problems (IVPs) for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), validated methods for IVPs for ODEs have two important advantages: if they return a solution to a problem, then (1) the problem is guaranteed to have a unique solution, and (2) an enclosure of the true solution is produced. The authors survey Taylor series methods for validated solutions of IVPs for ODEs, describe several such methods in a common framework, and identify areas for future research. 1. Introduction. We consider validated numerical methods for the solution of

Reference-contexts: The purpose of this paper is to review the most significant developments in the area of validated solutions of IVPs for ODEs. We focus on the interval methods of Moore [28, 29, 30], Kruckeberg [22], Eijgenraam [14], and Lohner <ref> [1, 25, 26] </ref>, all of which are based on Taylor series. One reason for the popularity of this approach is the simple form of the error term for Taylor series methods. <p> Consider the autonomous differential system y 0 (t) = f (y); y (t j ) = y j :(2.5.4) We introduce the sequence of functions f <ref> [1] </ref> = f ;(2.5.5) 1 @f [i1] f; for i 2:(2.5.6) Using (2.5.4-2.5.6), the Taylor coefficients of y (t) at t j satisfy (y j ) 0 = y j ;(2.5.7) (y j ) i = f [i] (y j ) = i @f [i1] f (y j ); for i <p> j ) = f [i] (^y j ) + J f [i] ; y j ; ^y j (y j ^y j );(7.3) where J is the Jacobian of f [i] with its l-th row evaluated at y j + il (^y j y j ) for some il 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> (l = 1; : : :; n). <p> Computing [S j ]. Lohner shows how the matrices [S j ] can be computed (see for example <ref> [1] </ref>). We describe his method in a slightly different notation. <p> Since kjAj jA 1 jk cond (A) for a nonsingular A 2 R nfin ; a small condition number of A j+1 will always guarantee that kjA j+1 jjA 1 j+1 jk is small. 7.5. Lohner's Method. We derive Lohner's method from (7.4) in a different way than in <ref> [1, 25, 26] </ref>. We show how [y 1 ] and [y 2 ] are computed, and then we give the algorithm for any [y j ]. <p> Example. Let A = 1 1 <ref> [1; 4] </ref> : The QR-factorization of A is A = p 2 1 p 0 1 =: QR (7.5.18) Consider the set fAr j r 2 [r]g :(7.5.19) The parallelepiped specified by [r] (see Fig. 7.5.1a) is mapped by A into the parallelepiped shown in Fig. 7.5.1b.

One reason for the popularity of this approach is the simple form of the error term for Taylor series methods. <p> In Taylor series methods, the computation of a tighter enclosure is based on Taylor series plus remainder, the mean-value theorem, and various interval transformations. In Algorithm I, it is important to take as a large a step as possible. Kruckeberg [22], Eijgenraam <ref> [14] </ref>, and Lohner [26] use constant a priori enclosures in their algorithms. A disadvantage of the constant a priori approach is that the stepsize is restricted to Euler steps, independently of the order of the Taylor series used in the second algorithm. <p> If f is continuously differentiable, then there exists ff &gt; 0 such that the Picard-Lindelof operator satisfies (5.3) with the metric being the exponential norm with this ff, <ref> [14, pp. 66-67] </ref>, [26, pp. 27-29]. Therefore, if Y is a complete metric space with the exponential norm and T Y Y; then T has a unique fixed-point in Y . 5.1. Constant Enclosure. <p> The inclusion in (5.1.2) can be easily verified. However, a serious disadvantage of the method is that the stepsize is restricted to Euler steps, even when high-order methods are used to tighten the a priori enclosure in Algorithm II.

Lohner also represents the enclosure of the solution as a linear transformation of an interval vector. He proposes a QR-factorization method, which shows the most promising behavior. <p> Moore [30, p. 134] showed that at t = 2, the interval inclusion is inflated by a factor of e 2 535, as the stepsize tends to zero.

Reference-contexts: The purpose of this paper is to review the most significant developments in the area of validated solutions of IVPs for ODEs. We focus on the interval methods of Moore [28, 29, 30], Kruckeberg [22], Eijgenraam [14], and Lohner <ref> [1, 25, 26] </ref>, all of which are based on Taylor series. One reason for the popularity of this approach is the simple form of the error term for Taylor series methods. <p> In Taylor series methods, the computation of a tighter enclosure is based on Taylor series plus remainder, the mean-value theorem, and various interval transformations. In Algorithm I, it is important to take as a large a step as possible. Kruckeberg [22], Eijgenraam [14], and Lohner <ref> [26] </ref> use constant a priori enclosures in their algorithms. A disadvantage of the constant a priori approach is that the stepsize is restricted to Euler steps, independently of the order of the Taylor series used in the second algorithm. <p> We discuss in more detail the wrapping effect in x6 and the algorithms of Moore, Kruckeberg, Eijgenraam, Lohner, and the extended mean-value method in x7. The most successful software for the validated solution of IVPs for ODEs is Lohner's Anfangswertaufgabe (AWA) package <ref> [26] </ref>. It does not automatically select the stepsize or order: they have to be specified by the user and cannot be changed during execution. As Stetter [41] points out, AWA is often computationally expensive. We discuss stepsize and order control in more detail in x8. 5. <p> If f is continuously differentiable, then there exists ff &gt; 0 such that the Picard-Lindelof operator satisfies (5.3) with the metric being the exponential norm with this ff, [14, pp. 66-67], <ref> [26, pp. 27-29] </ref>. Therefore, if Y is a complete metric space with the exponential norm and T Y Y; then T has a unique fixed-point in Y . 5.1. Constant Enclosure. <p> The inclusion in (5.1.2) can be easily verified. However, a serious disadvantage of the method is that the stepsize is restricted to Euler steps, even when high-order methods are used to tighten the a priori enclosure in Algorithm II. Eijgenraam [14, pp. 59-67] and Lohner <ref> [26, pp. 27-31] </ref> use a constant a priori enclosure in their algorithms. 1 We use superscripts on vectors to indicate different vectors, not powers of vectors. Validated Solutions of Initial Value Problems 11 5.2. Polynomial Enclosure. <p> Since kjAj jA 1 jk cond (A) for a nonsingular A 2 R nfin ; a small condition number of A j+1 will always guarantee that kjA j+1 jjA 1 j+1 jk is small. 7.5. Lohner's Method. We derive Lohner's method from (7.4) in a different way than in <ref> [1, 25, 26] </ref>. We show how [y 1 ] and [y 2 ] are computed, and then we give the algorithm for any [y j ]. <p> Some Directions for Future Research. Compared to the standard numerical methods for IVPs for ODEs, little work has been done for the validated solution of ODEs. The most advanced (and probably the only) validated solver for ODEs is AWA <ref> [26] </ref>. As Corliss points out [9], "there is no widely available portable, production-quality software for validated solution of ODEs". Such software should allow researchers to experiment easily with interval algorithms for ODEs and should be: * portable; * modular; * easy-to-modify; and * able to solve large problems.

Reference-contexts: There are situations when guaranteed error bounds are desired or needed. For example, a solution with a guaranteed error bound could be used to prove a theorem <ref> [39] </ref>. Also, some calculations may be critical to the safety or reliability of a system. It may therefore be necessary or desirable to ensure that a computed solution meets a user-specified accuracy requirement.
