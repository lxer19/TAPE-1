Abstract: We present empirical evidence for considering volatility of Eurodollar futures as a stochastic process, requiring a generalization of the standard Black-Scholes (BS) model which treats volatility as a constant. We use a previous development of a statistical mechanics of financial markets (SMFM) to model these issues.

Reference-contexts: In such highly nonlinear nonequilibrium contexts, it may be useful to look for other criteria that can maximize profits and reduce risk. A formal approach to a statistical mechanics of nonlinear financial markets (SMFM) <ref> [4] </ref> has been shown to be useful in other disciplines, e.g., analyses of electroencephalography and combat scenarios, as documented in several papers available from the http://www.ingber.com archive. <p> This can be understood in the Stratonovich (midpoint discretized) representation for more than two variables for nonconstant diffusions, where it is seen that a Riemannian geometry is induced by the metric g GG , exhibiting the invariance of the basic probability distribution under this geometry <ref> [4] </ref>. For example, the Lagrangian in in Eq. (24) is in the Ito ^ prepoint representation.

Reference-contexts: These physical entities provide another form of intuitive, but quantitatively precise, presentation of these analyses. For example, daily newspapers use this terminology to discuss the movement of security prices. The CMI can be used to develop trading rules <ref> [8] </ref>. The extreme sensitivity of the CMI gives rapid feedback on the changes in trends as well as the volatility of markets. A time-locked moving average, yielding averages over each time in moving windows during which the model is fit to data, provides manageable indicators for trading signals.

Reference-contexts: OUTLINE OF OPTIONS 2.1. Eurodollars Eurodollars are fixed-rate time deposits held primarily by overseas banks, but denominated in US dollars. They are not subject to US banking regulations and therefore tend to have a tighter bid-ask spread than deposits held in the United States <ref> [9] </ref>. Volatility of Volatility ... - 2 - L Ingber & JK Wilson 2.2. Futures The three-month Eurodollar futures contract is one of the most actively traded futures markets in the world. <p> The Eurodollar futures are cash settled based on the 90-day London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR). A notional principal amount of $1 million, is used to determine the change in the total interest payable on a hypothetical underlying time deposit, but is never actually paid or received <ref> [9] </ref>. Currently a total of 40 quarterly Eurodollar futures contracts (or ten years worth) are listed, with expirations annually in March, June, September and December. 2.3.

Reference-contexts: For the above example of V = C, Other trading strategies based on this simple model are based on hedging with other similar constructs, e.g., using gamma (G), theta (Q), vega, rho (r) <ref> [10] </ref>, G = 2 S 2 Q = t vega = P , Volatility of Volatility ... - 4 - L Ingber & JK Wilson r = r The BS equation, Eq. (1), may be written as Q + rSD + 2 2 4. GENERALIZATION OF BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL 4.1. <p> above three-variable set of stochastic differential equations for S, V and s of course can be processed by the BS methodology, subject to linear algebraic constraints, essentially combining weighted sums of these equations to subtract out the noise terms in dX and dY dX to contribute to a risk-neutral-type portfolio <ref> [10] </ref>. However, there exist other techniques to constrain such systems to paths that are not affected by noise to at least first and second order.

Reference-contexts: SOME DISCRETIZATION ISSUES Since tree approximations and/or discretization of variables are often applied to calculating the above entities, it is useful to apply limits to some of these discretizations wherever possible [12-14]. Eq. (1) has another mathematically equivalent path-integral representation <ref> [15] </ref>, which often offers some advantages in formulation, calculation, and inclusion of boundary conditions. Here, attention is drawn to the derivation of limits on the meshes of d t and d V such that there can be maintained numerical equivalence between these equivalent algebraic representations. 4.3. <p> There are of course other discretizations than the Ito ^ prepoint discretization of stochastic differential equations such as Eq. (4), related to other differential-operator orderings of partial differential equations such as Eq. (1), also related to other transformations of variables in Lagrangians such as Eq. (24) <ref> [15] </ref>. This can be understood in the Stratonovich (midpoint discretized) representation for more than two variables for nonconstant diffusions, where it is seen that a Riemannian geometry is induced by the metric g GG , exhibiting the invariance of the basic probability distribution under this geometry [4].
