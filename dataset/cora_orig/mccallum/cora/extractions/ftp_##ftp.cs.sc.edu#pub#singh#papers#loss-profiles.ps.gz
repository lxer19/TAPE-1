Abstract: In an earlier paper [3] we proposed the implementation of Loss Profiles (a new QoS measure for Mobile Computing) as a sub-layer at the transport layer. In this paper we examine the possibility of implementing a limited form of Loss Profiles at the link layer.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In <ref> [3] </ref> we identified a new QOS parameter for the mobile environment, called loss profiles, that ensures graceful degradation of service (for applications that can tolerate loss) in situations where user demands exceed the network's capacity to satisfy them. <p> There is thus nothing to prevent several users with open connections from congregating within the same cell. How can the network deal with such situations? Our proposal, discussed in our earlier paper <ref> [3] </ref>, is to implement a sub-layer, sitting on top of UDP and CM (Continuous Media) protocols that enables the sender to put flags within the data stream. These flags delineate logical data segments that can be discarded (by an intermediate node) in the event of a bandwidth crunch. <p> follow our specification! For that reason, we propose a version of loss profiles that can be implemented by the base stations (MSSs in our architecture) and, perhaps, by an ad hoc node `close' to the MH. 3 Loss Profiles at the MSS The central idea is to require, as in <ref> [3] </ref>, that the sender insert flags within the data stream to delineate logical data segments. However, these flags are not interpreted by the MSS. <p> For example, for an audio connection, a random uniform loss would be preferred, by the user, to a clustered loss at the end of every T seconds. While the latter may be appropriate for a video connection (see the user studies reported in <ref> [3] </ref>). <p> This information is sufficient to determine which segments have suffered partial data loss. Assume that the application running at the MH has a predefined acceptable loss profile specified as a library function. In <ref> [3] </ref> we propose that loss profiles, such as uniform loss, clustered loss, etc., be parameterized as function calls. A simple example is a function that implements uniform loss.
