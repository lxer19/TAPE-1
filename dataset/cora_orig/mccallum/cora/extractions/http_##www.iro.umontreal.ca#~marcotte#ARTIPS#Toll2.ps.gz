Abstract: We consider a bilevel model where the leader wants to maximize revenues from a taxation scheme, while the follower rationnally reacts to those tax levels. We focus our attention on the special case of a toll-setting problem defined on a multicommodity transportation network. We show that the general problem is NP-complete, while particular instances are polynomially solvable. Numerical examples are given.

Reference-contexts: The linear bilevel programming problem has been shown to be NP-complete by Jeroslow [12]. Penalty schemes have been investigated, dating back to Aiyoshi and Shimizu <ref> [1] </ref> in the nonlinear case. Recently, Marcotte and Zhu [17] have generalized this result to bilevel problems where the lower level is described by a variational inequality.

Reference-contexts: We show that TOP is NP-complete by a reduction from the Directed Hamiltonian Path problem (DHP, see Garey and Johnson <ref> [11] </ref>) to TOP. Let G = (N; A) be a directed graph. We seek an Hamiltonian path between two distinguished vertices s and t of N and show that this can be achieved by finding a polynomially related toll setting problem.

Reference-contexts: Both these drawbacks could be eliminated by introducing a range of value-of-time parameters across users. For instance (see Leurent <ref> [13] </ref>), let ff denote the value-of-time parameter associated with a cross-section ff of the user 29 population, and assume that ff is distributed according to a function H (ff) whose derivative h (ff) is the associated density function, i.e.: H 0 (ff) = h (ff) h (ff) 0 0 The lower
