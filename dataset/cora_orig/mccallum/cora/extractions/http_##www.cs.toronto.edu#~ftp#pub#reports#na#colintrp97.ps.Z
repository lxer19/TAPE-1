Abstract: A long-standing open question associated with the use of collocation methods for boundary value ordinary differential equations is concerned with the development of a high order continuous solution approximation to augment the high order discrete solution approximation, obtained at the mesh points which subdivide the problem interval. It is well-known that the use of collocation at Gauss points leads to solution approximations at the mesh points for which the global error is O(h 2k ), where k is the number of collocation points used per subinterval and h is the subinterval size. The collocation solution also yields a C 0 continuous solution approximation that has a global error of O(h k+1 ). The discrete solution is thus said to be superconvergent. In this paper, we show how to efficiently augment the superconvergent discrete collocation solution to obtain C 1 continuous "superconvergent" interpolants, whose global errors are O(h 2k ). The key ideas are to use the theoretical framework of continuous Runge-Kutta schemes and to augment the collocation solution with inexpensive mono-implicit Runge-Kutta stages. Specific schemes are derived for k = 1,2,3, and 4. Numerical results are provided to support the theoretical analysis.

Reference-contexts: The general form of a CRK scheme, for the ith subinterval, is (see e.g. [15]) u i (t i1 + h) = y i1 + r=1 3 where b r () is a polynomial in 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, b t r = t i1 + c r h, and by r = y i1 + h j=1 The evaluations of the derivatives, f ( b t r ; by r ), will be referred to as implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) stages. <p> The idea of deriving schemes which use a combination of different kinds of stages, i.e. collocation and mono-implicit stages, is also related to the SDIRK schemes [8] where singly-implicit Runge-Kutta schemes are augmented with diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) <ref> [1] </ref> stages.

Reference-contexts: Note that since endpoint stages can be shared between adjacent subintervals, the CRK schemes are obtained at the cost of only one extra function evaluation per subinterval. 5 Collocation with k = 2 The implicit Runge-Kutta scheme corresponding to collocation at two Gauss points per subinterval is given in <ref> [7] </ref>.

The corresponding C 0 collocation polynomial has local and global errors of O (h 4 ). <p> The equivalent implicit Runge-Kutta scheme is given in <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The CRK scheme will also employ additional MIRK stages, (8), in order to obtain a scheme of the desired order of accuracy. The idea is a very natural extension of the embedding of a discrete MIRK scheme within a CMIRK scheme, as employed in MIRKDC <ref> [11] </ref> and as further considered in [13]. The idea of deriving schemes which use a combination of different kinds of stages, i.e. collocation and mono-implicit stages, is also related to the SDIRK schemes [8] where singly-implicit Runge-Kutta schemes are augmented with diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) [1] stages.

Reference-contexts: Another is to investigate the development of continuous Runge-Kutta schemes for higher order differential equations, since the collocation method is able to handle such equations quite naturally.

Reference-contexts: It is also possible to write (6) in an equivalent "parameterized" form, <ref> [14] </ref>, by r = (1 v r )y i1 + v r y i + h j=1 and we will refer to stages written in this form as parameterized IRK stages or PIRK stages. <p> Note also that any stage written in MIRK form, (8), can be transformed to IRK form, (6) (see <ref> [14] </ref>), while any IRK stage (6) can be trivially written in the form (7), with v r = 0 and x rj = a rj . The CRK scheme will be constructed to use as much information from the collocation method as possible.

Reference-contexts: The general form of a CRK scheme, for the ith subinterval, is (see e.g. <ref> [15] </ref>) u i (t i1 + h) = y i1 + r=1 3 where b r () is a polynomial in 2 [0; 1], b t r = t i1 + c r h, and by r = y i1 + h j=1 The evaluations of the derivatives, f ( b <p> Since the extra MIRK stages and the endpoint stages can be computed explicitly, and the collocation stages are already available, the associated costs are low. The general approach used in deriving the CRK schemes is the same as in <ref> [15] </ref>, to which we refer the reader for further background. It should be emphasized that the computations for the setup of the super-convergent interpolant occur after the collocation solution has been computed. Thus the stability of the calculation of the global solution is not affected. <p> The resultant scheme will contain the endpoint stages and collocation stages embedded within it and will include three extra MIRK stages assumed to have at least stage order 5. We continue with our analysis of the order conditions, following a strategy similar to that of <ref> [15] </ref>. We focus on the four nonquadrature conditions.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [16] </ref>, the author considers augmenting the high order discrete collocation solution by constructing, for each subinterval, a high order polynomial interpolant, having a global error also of O (h 2k ), determined using mesh point solution approximations from several adjacent subintervals.

Reference-contexts: The author reports some difficulties, one of which is that the numerical stability of the approach depends on the ratio of subinterval sizes; these ratios can be large for the nonuniform meshes which arise in the solution of difficult BVODEs.
