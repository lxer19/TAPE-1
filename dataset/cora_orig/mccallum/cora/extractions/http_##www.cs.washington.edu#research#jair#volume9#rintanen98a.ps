Abstract: In default reasoning, usually not all possible ways of resolving conflicts between default rules are acceptable. Criteria expressing acceptable ways of resolving the conflicts may be hardwired in the inference mechanism, for example specificity in inheritance reasoning can be handled this way, or they may be given abstractly as an ordering on the default rules. In this article we investigate formalizations of the latter approach in Reiter's default logic. Our goal is to analyze and compare the computational properties of three such formalizations in terms of their computational complexity: the prioritized default logics of Baader and Hollunder, and Brewka, and a prioritized default logic that is based on lexicographic comparison. The analysis locates the propositional variants of these logics on the second and third levels of the polynomial hierarchy, and identifies the boundary between tractable and intractable inference for restricted classes of prioritized default theories.

Reference-contexts: For partial priorities tractability can be achieved only with extreme syntactic restrictions, the complexity being the same as with the prioritized default logics by Brewka and by Baader and Hollunder. 2. Preliminaries on Computational Complexity In this section we introduce some basic concepts in computational complexity. For details see <ref> (Balcazar, Diaz, & Gabarro, 1995) </ref>. The complexity class P consists of decision problems that are solvable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine. NP is the class of decision problems that are solvable in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine.

Reference-contexts: procedural nature of prioritization is 440 Complexity of Prioritized Default Logics sensitive to the lengths of sequences of defaults involved in deriving certain facts: among two conflicting defaults the one with the lower priority may become applied solely because the sequence of defaults needed for deriving its prerequisite is shorter <ref> (Brewka & Eiter, 1998) </ref>. Approaches to prioritizing defaults that are based on lexicographic comparison (Lif-schitz, 1985; Brewka, 1989; Geffner & Pearl, 1992; Ryan, 1992) do not exhibit that kind of behavior. Lexicographic comparison has properties that are favorable from the point of view of knowledge representation.

Reference-contexts: This paper can be seen as giving guidelines in that direction. The decision problems of propositional default logic are located on the second level of the polynomial hierarchy <ref> (Gottlob, 1992) </ref>, and hence they do not belong to the classes NP or co-NP unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its first level. <p> prerequisite-free ordered unary :q q q :q 12 prerequisite-free normal :b 1 ^^b n b 1 ^^b n 13 prerequisite-free normal unary :q q :q 14 prerequisite-free positive normal unary :q q Table 1: Form of defaults in a number of classes of default theories the restriction to normal defaults <ref> (Gottlob, 1992) </ref>.

Lemma 5.12 Computing a given component of X 1 in Maximum 2-quantified formula is polynomial time many-one reducible to the problem of testing whether a formula belongs to all T -preferred L extensions of a default theory for strict total orders T .

Reference-contexts: When extending this set, some of the inferences may become invalid, and hence the set of inferable facts does not monotonically increase. For example, in the kind of reasoning expressed as inheritance networks <ref> (Horty, 1994) </ref>, one network link may say that priests imbibe non-alcoholic beverages only. This is, in the absence of contrary information, a sufficient reason to conclude that a certain priest will not drink vodka. <p> Specificity as a basis for resolving conflicts between defaults has been investigated in the framework of path-based inheritance theories <ref> (Horty, 1994) </ref>. In general, however, priorities may come from different sources, and therefore it is justified to investigate non-monotonic reasoning with an abstract notion of priorities as orderings on defaults.

Reference-contexts: Not all seminormal default theories have extensions, but all ordered default theories do. In some cases, a decision problem for a class of default theories is intractable, but for the subclass in which the default theories are ordered, it is tractable <ref> (Kautz & Selman, 1991) </ref>. In later sections we analyze the complexity of decision problems both with and without the orderedness condition. Definition 3.6 (Etherington, 1987) Let = hD; W i be a seminormal default theory. Without loss of generality assume that all formulae are in clausal form. <p> Cautious reasoning has not been investigated. * If W consists of literals, brave reasoning for the prerequisite-free normal class and the Horn class are tractable (Kautz & Selman, 1991; Stillman, 1990). Cautious reasoning is tractable for the normal unary class <ref> (Kautz & Selman, 1991) </ref>. Cautious reasoning for the prerequisite-free classes has not been investigated. We present a similar analysis for the same classes of prioritized default logics starting with the case where priorities totally order the defaults. <p> By definition this disjunct is true in M . Hence every clause in C is true in M . 2 An alternative way of obtaining the intractability of cautious reasoning for all classes with a Horn objective part is to apply Theorem 8.2 in <ref> (Kautz & Selman, 1991) </ref> that reduces brave reasoning to cautious reasoning by adding a default :l=l and the intractability result for brave reasoning in Horn classes (Stillman, 1990). This is not applicable to the 2-literal case because in it brave reasoning is tractable. <p> is applied in all preferred L extensions if it is possible to apply it, and k belongs to those extensions if and only if OE belongs to them. 2 As a corollary, together with a theorem that shows the intractability of brave reasoning of the class in Reiter's default logic <ref> (Kautz & Selman, 1991) </ref>, we obtain the following result. Corollary 5.18 Testing hD; W i j= L P l for strict total orders P, literals l, and disjunction-free normal default theories hD; W i where W is a set of literals, is NP-hard. <p> Therefore the procedure returns true if and only if there is an extension E of hD; W i such that A GD (E; ). 2 The tractability result is related to the tractability of brave reasoning of the same class as shown by Lemma 6.4 in <ref> (Kautz & Selman, 1991) </ref>. 5.2.4 Results for Arbitrary Priorities The previous section restricts to the special case where priorities are a strict total ordering on the defaults. However, for instance in representing inheritance networks, two defaults sometimes need to have an equal (or incomparable) priority. <p> The complexity results for unrestricted priorities are summarized in Table 6. Like in earlier sections, references to theorems are given in Table 7. The results in the previous sections as well as results on the complexity of cautious reasoning <ref> (Kautz & Selman, 1991) </ref> directly imply the intractability of many classes of reasoning with arbitrary priorities, because the former two are a special case of the latter. Classes of default theories for which the tractability question remains open are the prerequisite-free normal classes and the normal unary class with literals. <p> Hence it is correct to return false. Therefore the algorithm returns true if and only if l is in all P-preferred L extensions of . Clearly, the algorithm runs in polynomial time. 2 Without priorities, cautious and brave reasoning for normal unary theories and 1-literal clauses is tractable <ref> (Kautz & Selman, 1991) </ref>. We show that priorities increase the expres-sivity sufficiently to make this class intractable.

Reference-contexts: In many cases the restrictions that lead to polynomial time decision procedures are too severe to make the procedures practically useful. Even though nonmonotonic reasoning usually cannot be performed in polynomial time, new developments in implementation techniques have made it possible to solve problems that previously were too difficult <ref> (Niemela & Simons, 1996) </ref>. Hence there are some prospects of making nonmonotonic reasoning practically useful, which makes the problem of introducing priority information in nonmonotonic reasoning more acute. This paper can be seen as giving guidelines in that direction.

Reference-contexts: First we analyze the computational complexity of two closely related prioritized default logics (Brewka, 1994; Baader & Hollunder, 1995). These logics are based on the semicon-structive definition of extensions of default logic <ref> (Reiter, 1980) </ref>: the priorities control the construction of extensions, ruling out those that do not respect the priorities. In the general case the complexity of the decision problems of these logics equals the complexity of those of Reiter's default logic, being complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. <p> We say 425 Rintanen that the function f L 0 is a translation from L 0 to L. A problem is C-complete if it belongs to the class C and is C-hard. 3. Preliminaries on Default Logic Default logic is one of the main formalizations of nonmonotonic reasoning <ref> (Reiter, 1980) </ref>. <p> The size of a default theory hD; W i is the sum of the lengths of the formulae in W and in defaults in D. A default theory is finite if D and W are finite. Definition 3.1 <ref> (Reiter, 1980) </ref> Let = hD; W i be a default theory. <p> A set of formulae E L is an extension for if and only if (E) = E. 426 Complexity of Prioritized Default Logics More procedural is the semiconstructive definition, so called because it suggests a nondeterministic procedure for computing extensions.

Then E = Cn (W [ ffljff:fi 1 ; : : : ; fi n =fl 2 GD (E; )g). <p> By Theorem 3.2 in <ref> (Reiter, 1980) </ref> there is an extension E of hD; ;i such that E 0 E. Because n 2 E 0 E for all n = N (c) with c 2 C, false 62 E. Assume that there is an extension E of hD; ;i such that false 62 E. <p> The proofs of both the base case and the inductive case are straightforward. The claim of the lemma is obtained from the facts established in the induction proof as follows. By (1) the set X n is non-empty. By (2) and Theorems 2.4 and 2.5 in <ref> (Reiter, 1980) </ref> 442 Complexity of Prioritized Default Logics PROCEDURE extension (D; W; E); E 0 := W ; REPEAT E 00 := E 0 ; FOR EACH ff:fi 1 ; : : : ; fi n =fl 2 D DO IF hE 0 ; ffi 2 CN and hE; :fii 62 <p> Proof: By Lemma 5.4 there is at most one P-preferred L extension for each member of C, and because the defaults in members of C are normal, there is at least one extension for each member of C by Theorem 3.1 in <ref> (Reiter, 1980) </ref>. Therefore there is exactly one P-preferred L extension for each member of C. A decision procedure for the class of default theories stated in the theorem is given in Figure 8. <p> The "only if" direction directly follows from Theorem 3.2 in <ref> (Reiter, 1980) </ref> because D 0 D and D is normal. Assume that there is an extension E of such that A GD (E; ).

Lexicographic Prioritized Default Logic A definition of prioritized default logic is used by Rintanen (1999). This definition is based on an earlier one for autoepistemic logic <ref> (Rintanen, 1994) </ref>. The priority mechanism uses lexicographic comparison and the preferred extensions in this approach do not in general coincide with the preferred extensions in the prioritized default logics discussed in Section 4.

Reference-contexts: There have been many proposals of differing generality. Preferred subtheories (Brewka, 1989) and ordered theory presentations (Ryan, 1992) do not have as general a notion of defaults as Reiter's default logic, and they can both be translated to prerequisite-free normal default theories of a prioritized default logic <ref> (Rintanen, 1999) </ref>. Also the definitions of model minimization in conditional entailment (Geffner & Pearl, 1992) and in prioritized circumscription (Lifschitz, 1985) do not directly support defaults with prerequisites. <p> In this work we concentrate on Brewka's (1994) and Baader and Hollunder's (1995) proposals for incorporating priorities to default logic, as well as a proposal that uses lexicographic comparison <ref> (Rintanen, 1999) </ref>. These three proposals address default reasoning with defaults that have prerequisites. <p> With arbitrary strict partial orders there is no similar decrease. We continue by analyzing a prioritized default logic that is based on comparing the Reiter extensions of a default theory by lexicographic comparison <ref> (Rintanen, 1999) </ref>. The decision problem of this logic is harder than the decision problems of Reiter's default logic, assuming that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse. <p> Brewka and Eiter show that the prioritized default logic investigated in Section 5 violates this principle. However, Principle II is not violated by a closely related prioritized default logic that replaces application with non-defeat <ref> (Rintanen, 1999) </ref>. A default ff:fi=fl is defeated in E if E j= ff ^ :fi. Therefore it is not in general the case that lexicographic definitions of preferredness would violate Principle II. However, we believe that Brewka and Eiter would nevertheless find this definition of preferred extensions counterintuitive. <p> If a restriction to defaults with literal prerequisites and conclusions is made, this could be done simply by requiring that l:m=nPl 0 :m 0 =n 0 whenever n = l 0 . Priorities used in translating inheritance networks to prioritized default logic fulfill this requirement <ref> (Rintanen, 1999) </ref>. 7. Conclusions We have presented a thorough analysis of the complexity of three versions of prioritized default logic, giving results that place these logics in the polynomial hierarchy, and analyzing the question of intractability versus tractability for syntactically restricted classes of default theories.

Rintanen setting the problem is to define what are the correct inferences in the presence of priorities. There have been many proposals of differing generality. Preferred subtheories (Brewka, 1989) and ordered theory presentations <ref> (Ryan, 1992) </ref> do not have as general a notion of defaults as Reiter's default logic, and they can both be translated to prerequisite-free normal default theories of a prioritized default logic (Rintanen, 1999).

Reference-contexts: and also the case where defaults are prerequisite-free. 1 The most general tractable classes in default logic without priorities are the following. * If the objective part W may contain Horn clauses, none of the restrictions on the form of default rules is sufficient for achieving tractability in brave reasoning <ref> (Stillman, 1990) </ref>. Cautious reasoning has not been investigated. * If W consists of 2-literal clauses, brave reasoning for the prerequisite-free normal class is tractable (Stillman, 1990). <p> the objective part W may contain Horn clauses, none of the restrictions on the form of default rules is sufficient for achieving tractability in brave reasoning <ref> (Stillman, 1990) </ref>. Cautious reasoning has not been investigated. * If W consists of 2-literal clauses, brave reasoning for the prerequisite-free normal class is tractable (Stillman, 1990). Cautious reasoning has not been investigated. * If W consists of literals, brave reasoning for the prerequisite-free normal class and the Horn class are tractable (Kautz & Selman, 1991; Stillman, 1990). Cautious reasoning is tractable for the normal unary class (Kautz & Selman, 1991). <p> An alternative way of obtaining the intractability of cautious reasoning for all classes with a Horn objective part is to apply Theorem 8.2 in (Kautz & Selman, 1991) that reduces brave reasoning to cautious reasoning by adding a default :l=l and the intractability result for brave reasoning in Horn classes <ref> (Stillman, 1990) </ref>. This is not applicable to the 2-literal case because in it brave reasoning is tractable. Theorem 4.13 Testing hD; ;i j= c l for literals l and sets D of prerequisite-free normal defaults with conclusions that are conjunctions of literals, is co-NP-hard. <p> That the procedure runs in polynomial time on the size of hD; W i is also obvious. Thus any polynomial time subset C of classical propositional logic produces a tractable class of default theories. 2 Without priorities reasoning with prerequisite-free normal default rules and Horn clauses is NP-complete <ref> (Stillman, 1990) </ref>. For normal defaults, tractability can be obtained also for defaults with prerequisites if suitable restrictions are imposed on the prerequisites, conclu sions, and the objective parts of the default theories. Next we present such a class that is neither subsumed by nor subsumes the tractable prerequisite-free classes.
