Abstract: The development of a software system which can detect and identify the flight calls of migrating birds is reported. The system first produces a spectrogram using a Discrete Fourier transform. Calls are detected in the spectrogram using an ad-hoc combination of local peak-finding and a connectedness measure. Attributes are extracted both globally from the call and from a window moved incrementally through the call. Quinlan's C4.5 machine learning system is used to induce a decision tree-based classifier. The system has been tested on a set of 138 flight calls from 9 species of birds. Some calls are faint and interfering insect noise is present in others. Eight-fold resampling was used to classify the calls unseen. 78% of calls were identified correctly, 4% incorrectly and 18% were left unclassified.

Reference-contexts: We believe a useful set of animal vocalisations have sufficiently similar basic characteristics that they could also be identified using this methods. These include the echo-location signals of bats and the whistles of dolphins and other small cetaceans. 2 Data Set Evans <ref> [Eva94] </ref> has used recording stations spread over several hundred kilometres to census the extensive nocturnal bird migrations of North America. Manually identifying and counting the flight calls is an extremely time consuming part of Evans' study.

Reference-contexts: In some areas and for some taxa few suitably-skilled observers are available. Automatic methods to identify and count animal vocalisations would allow more extensive, more consistent and cheaper population monitoring for many species. It also can make feasible important studies which are not feasible with human observers <ref> [Gri95] </ref>. In this paper we report a successful method for identifying the flight calls of number of bird species. We believe a useful set of animal vocalisations have sufficiently similar basic characteristics that they could also be identified using this methods.

Reference-contexts: The obvious remedy is to somehow filter out poor attributes. We developed a wrapper shell script for C4.5 which starts with an empty set of attributes and incrementally adds to the set the attribute that produces the largest improvement in classifier performance. We developed this method independently of <ref> [JKP94] </ref> who term this forward selection and discuss it and alternative methods in detail. This approach may be not be feasible with classification systems in which classifier construction is more expensive. Fortunately, classifier construction time in C4.5 is linear in the number of cases.

Reference-contexts: Exploratory attempts at inducing separate classifiers for each of the 9 species suggested the data set was too small for this approach to be successful. Otherwise the combination of 9 separate classifiers might produce a significantly lower error rate. Mills <ref> [Mil95] </ref> was successful in constructing separate classifiers using a larger version of the same data set which contained roughly 600 calls. Exact comparison with Mills' work is difficult because Mills employed some manual preprocessing.

Reference-contexts: Classifiers of suitable performance could likely have been produced by other methods, for example using a network classification system, which are popular in similar domains, e.g <ref> [PMC94] </ref>. However the efficiency of classifier construction was crucial and other classification systems may not have met these demands. 4 5 Global Classification We tried many methods for extracting attributes from frequency tracks and there are many other possibilities we didn't explore.

Reference-contexts: Low energy peaks forming a spurious suffix or prefix to a frequency track are detected by comparison to the average energy of the peaks of the track. 4 Classification System We have used Quinlan's C4.5 <ref> [Qui93] </ref> to build the classifiers in this work. Classifiers of suitable performance could likely have been produced by other methods, for example using a network classification system, which are popular in similar domains, e.g [PMC94].

Reference-contexts: This, in combination with machine learning, has been applied very successfully to speaker recognition <ref> [SS95] </ref>. After some trial-and-error experimentation with the window size and the resolution of the DFT we developed a successful windowed approach to classifying calls.
