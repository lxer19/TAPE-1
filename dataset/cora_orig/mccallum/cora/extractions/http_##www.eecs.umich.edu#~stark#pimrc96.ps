Abstract: In this paper the performance of different coding schemes for direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DS-SS) with multiple-access (MA) interference in a nonselective Rayleigh fading channel is considered. A conventional 64-ary orthogonal code (M 64 ) transmitting 6 bits of information is examined first. Each of the 64 code symbols in the M 64 code is assumed to be spread by a random sequence of length N , and the channel is assumed to be interleaved every N chips. We consider a M 64 DS-SS code concatenated with a (63; k) Reed-Solomon (RS) outer code and vary the amount of spreading and the code rate for a fixed data rate and bandwidth. Our analysis based on Gaussian approximation shows, when the number of users is reasonably large, an optimal value k fl to achieve minimum bit error probability of the (63,k) RS code can be found. Furthermore, we extend the results by substituting the M 64 code with the trellis coded Nordstrom-Robinson code (TCNR), and the trellis coded Reed-Muller code (TCRM), which have the same data rate as that of the M 64 code. An optimal value k fl to achieve minimum bit error probability can also be found when the TCNR code or the TCRM code is concatenated with a (63; k) RS outer code.

Reference-contexts: Trellis Coded NR (TCNR) Code We can further modify the NR code by combining the cosets B 0 ; B 1 ,...,B 7 with a 4-state trellis shown in Fig.1 [6] to form a trellis coded Nordstrom-Robinson (TCNR) code <ref> [1] </ref>. To encode, we divided each 6 information bits into 2 bits and 4 bits. The 2 bits determine which coset, and hence which outgoing branch, of the trellis, while the 4 bits determine which codeword in that coset is transmitted. <p> A fair comparison can be made between the TCNR code and the M 64 code since both have the same data rate. Previous work <ref> [1] </ref> has shown that when SIR is high, the errors in the TCNR code occur asymptotically independently, and most errors happen within a 16-ary orthogonal signal set, i.e., within the same coset in the NR code.

Reference-contexts: Starting with this biorthogonal code, we can increase the number of codewords up to 256 by carefully adding selected cosets of the biorthogonal code to the original code, with the minimum distance slightly decreasing to 6. By doing so we get the nonlinear Nordstrom-Robinson (NR) code <ref> [3] </ref>. The 256 codewords are divided into 8 cosets, each of 32 biorthogonal codewords. The geometric uniformity property is satisfied with the NR code, although it is not linear. Since the demodulator under consideration is noncoherent, only the orthogonal subcode of the NR code can be used. <p> IV. TCRM Code A. Reed-Muller (RM) Code The original NR code with 256 codewords, is actually a subcode of second-order Reed-Muller code of length 16 (RM (2,4)) <ref> [3] </ref>. Moreover, in addition to the 8 cosets of the NR code, we can carefully add 8 more cosets to the NR code, which is also a subcode of the RM (2,4) code, with the minimum distance decreasing to 4.

Reference-contexts: The orthogonality of signal set is also retained. Therefore, under the Gaussian assumption, the codeword error probability p e; M 64 of the M 64 code is <ref> [6] </ref> p e; M 64 = n=1 n ) (13) and the bit error probability is p b; M 64 = 32 63 p e; M 64 . <p> Trellis Coded NR (TCNR) Code We can further modify the NR code by combining the cosets B 0 ; B 1 ,...,B 7 with a 4-state trellis shown in Fig.1 <ref> [6] </ref> to form a trellis coded Nordstrom-Robinson (TCNR) code [1].

The 2 bits determine which coset, and hence which outgoing branch, of the trellis, while the 4 bits determine which codeword in that coset is transmitted.
