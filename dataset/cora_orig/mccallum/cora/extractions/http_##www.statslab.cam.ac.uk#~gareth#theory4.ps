Abstract: This paper considers the problem of scaling the proposal distribution of a multidimensional random walk Metropolis algorithm, in order to maximize the efficiency of the algorithm. The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimension of a sequence of target densities, n, converges to 1. When the proposal variance is appropriately scaled according to n, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first component of each Markov chain, converge to the appropriate limiting Langevin diffusion process. The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straight-forward efficiency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form. Extensions of the result are discussed.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, if the variance is too large, the Metropolis algorithm will reject too high a proportion of its proposed moves. A number of authors have suggested informal guidelines for scaling proposal to target variance ratios <ref> (for example, Besag and Green 1993) </ref> or monitoring accept/reject ratios (see for example Besag et. al., 1995). However, although such rules of thumb often work well in practice, to date there have been no theoretical results to support them.

In this paper, we consider the asymptotic problem as the dimension of the state space, n, converges to infinity.

Reference-contexts: The asymptotic result is unaltered by the choice of divisor, however our prefered choice here leads to a simpler proof. Let us denote by ), weak convergence of processes in the Skorokhod topology <ref> (see for example Ethier and Kurtz, 1986) </ref>. We can now state the result more precisely as follows. Theorem 1.1. Suppose f is positive and C 2 , and that (A1), and (A2) hold.

Reference-contexts: Note that in the definition of 2 n , we use the divisor n 1. This could be replaced by n which seems to be a more appropriate divisor for small n at least in the Gaussian case <ref> (see Gelman et. al., 1996) </ref>. The asymptotic result is unaltered by the choice of divisor, however our prefered choice here leads to a simpler proof. Let us denote by ), weak convergence of processes in the Skorokhod topology (see for example Ethier and Kurtz, 1986). <p> This result gives rise to the useful heuristic for random walk Metropolis in prac tice. Tune the proposal variance so that the average acceptance rate is roughly 1 4 . The accompanying paper <ref> (Gelman, Roberts and Gilks 1996) </ref> discusses the use of this heuristic in practice, and other related issues. Note that the optimal value ` is scaled, not by the standard deviation of the target density (as is often suggested), but by 1= p I.
