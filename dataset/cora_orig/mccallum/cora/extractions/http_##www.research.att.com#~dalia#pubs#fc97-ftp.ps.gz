Reference-contexts: They use pricing functions for preventing the mass utilization of electronic mail. Pricing functions are not incremental, and cannot be utilized (compactly) to measure the duration of visits. Cai et al. define the related notion of uncheatable benchmark <ref> [4, 1] </ref> for efficiently verifying claims of computational power. Some of the methods proposed for uncheatable benchmarking can be used incrementally. The methods used both in pricing functions and uncheatable benchmarks contain a trapdoor that allows efficient computation of the results.

Reference-contexts: We assume that clients and meters engage in a external visiting protocol by which clients access meters for certain durations. Our assumptions about the (opaque) vis iting protocol borrow from the HTTP protocol <ref> [2] </ref>, which motivated our work. However, other protocols may suit our abstract representation as well. 3.1 Assumptions about Meters and Clients Let m denote a meter and c a client. m and c communicate via a reliable FIFO communication channel.

Reference-contexts: Currently, dynamic deployment of software is supported in the Internet only for Java programs running on a Java virtual machine. Experience with com-putationally intensive Java applications indicates that it is inefficient <ref> [3] </ref>. This suggests that a forger can gain a significant advantage, even on a machine of comparable power, by coding the timing function in a more suitable language.

Reference-contexts: Another, more manageable way, is to position the meter on the gateway entering an organization's network and filter out visits generated from within the network. Most known routing tricks can be prevented by a meter thus positioned (see <ref> [5] </ref>). These types of network verifications prevent some small number of clients from masquerading as a larger and/or broader set of clients. Thus almost all visit records in the log file will represent visits by external clients.

Reference-contexts: Our metering scheme engages the client in computing the timing function incrementally throughout the duration of its visit, and thus, the output captures the duration of the visit. Dwork and Naor defined a related notion of a pricing function <ref> [6] </ref>, whose computation requires a known lower-bound investment of resources. They use pricing functions for preventing the mass utilization of electronic mail. Pricing functions are not incremental, and cannot be utilized (compactly) to measure the duration of visits.

Reference-contexts: A lightweight security mechanism in the virtual realm, where each individual forgery requires a modest but non-trivial computational effort, can be adequate for preventing large-scale fraud in practical applications. A number of "micro-payment" schemes have been designed in this manner (beginning with <ref> [7] </ref>). Note also that lightweight and heavyweight security mechanisms can be combined. In the physical world, one's valuables might be protected by a cheap lock on the front door, and a burglar alarm, and recorded serial numbers, and the threat of arrest.

Reference-contexts: Employing standard cryptographic methods to keep self-authenticating records of interactions on the WWW would be secure, and is enabled by some existing extensions to the WWW protocols, such as S-HTTP [10] and SSL <ref> [8] </ref>. These methods are clearly advantageous in offering a high level of auditability and non-repudiability. However, authenticating all clients has the drawback that all clients must register to obtain authentication keys. Not only is this a heavy administrative burden, but it leads to solutions that threaten the clients' privacy. <p> A meter can verify the origin of a visit at the network level to some extent. One method of achieving a high degree of assurance is to use cryptographically secure authentication codes, as supported in various extensions to the WWW protocols (e.g., S-HTTP [10], SSL <ref> [8] </ref>), to authenticate origins. Another, more manageable way, is to position the meter on the gateway entering an organization's network and filter out visits generated from within the network. Most known routing tricks can be prevented by a meter thus positioned (see [5]).

Reference-contexts: We believe that the Java environment will mature in the future, will become efficient, and will include accompanying mathematical libraries (such as Cryp-toLib <ref> [9] </ref>), enabling efficient cryptographic software in Java. Clients can avoid being metered in our approach in many ways, e.g., by disabling Java. This will be detectable by the meter after the client has finished its visit, and of no real benefit to the client.
