It has a resolution of 1024 fi 1280, with pixels of size 16m fi 16m. The 12 bit dynamic range gives 0 to 4095 integer radiance readings. The liquid cooling unit is capable of cooling the chip down to -50 ffi C. <p> Once the camera response for each focal distance was found, they were plotted together in Figure 5.2.2.2 for comparison. The figure also shows the manufacturer's published response curve for the CCD chip KAF1300L <ref> [13] </ref> as a solid line. This is a quantum efficiency curve for the CCD chip, uncorrected for the CCD camera lens transmittance or for actual energy (i.e. energy = hC where h is Plank's constant, C is the speed of light and is the wavelength).

Reference-contexts: Wide-band, unfiltered source signals are measured and compared with estimates of the same signal obtained by integrating the recreated spectral signal over all wavelengths. A reflecting surface (a picture in MATLAB User's Guide Plate 7 <ref> [19] </ref>) composed of eight regions of different reflection characteristics (i.e., different colors) was illuminated by the Lowel Tota 60 watt light source, and was imaged using the CCD camera. These regions, R, were selected for spectral recreation.
