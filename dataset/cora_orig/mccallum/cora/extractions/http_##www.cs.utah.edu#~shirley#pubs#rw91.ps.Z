Title: Direct Lighting Calculation by Monte Carlo Integration

Abstract: The details of doing a Monte Carlo direct lighting calculation are presented. For direct lighting from multiple luminaires, a method of sending one shadow ray per viewing ray is presented, and it is argued that this is preferable for scenes with many luminaires. Some issues of the design of probability densities on unions of luminaire surfaces are discussed.

One problem with Cook's method is that a direct lighting calculation generates a shadow ray for every luminaire, which is excessive for some environments.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Many rendering algorithms separately calculate direct and indirect lighting for visible surfaces. In early rendering algorithms, the direct lighting calculation was carried out on point luminaires, and the indirect lighting was approximated by an "ambient" term <ref> [3, 10] </ref>. This idea was later used by Whitted, but shadowing was added using visibility rays [15]. Cook extended this idea to area luminaires by using Monte Carlo integration [1].

Reference-contexts: Any integral over a region R (see Figure 1) can be approximated using Monte Carlo methods <ref> [4] </ref>: x 0 2R f (x) (2) where the point x is a random variable with probability density p. For this formula to be valid, p must be positive where f is nonzero. Equation 2 gives a primary estimator which might have a high variance.
