Abstract: Technical Report CSE-TR-300-96, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, August, 1996. ABSTRACT A wireless local area network (WLAN) or a cell with quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees for various types of traffic is considered. A centralized (i.e., star) network topology is adopted as the topology of a cell which consists of a base station and a number of mobile clients. Dynamic Time Division Duplexed (TDD) transmission is used, and hence, the same frequency channel is time-shared for downlink and uplink transmissions under the dynamic control of the base station. We divide traffic into three classes (say I, II, and III) according to the required QoS. Whenever there is no eligible class-I and II traffic, class-III traffic which requires no delay bound guarantees is transmitted, while uplink transmissions are controlled with a reservation scheme. Class-I traffic which requires a bounded delay and guaranteed throughput is handled with the framing strategy [1] which consists of a smoothness traffic model and the stop-and-go queueing scheme. We also establish the admission test for adding new class-I connections. We present a modified framing strategy for class-II voice uplink transmissions which utilizes the wireless link efficiently at the cost of some packet losses. Finally, we present the performance (average delay and throughput) evaluation of the reservation scheme for class-III traffic using both analytical calculations and simulations.

Reference-contexts: Basically, class-III traffic is transmitted when there is no class-I and II traffic to be transmitted since it has a lower priority than class I and II. The reservation scheme is also used for establishing new class-I and II connections requested by the mobile clients. The framing strategy <ref> [1, 5] </ref>, which was originally proposed as a framework for congestion management in integrated service packet networks, is, with some modifications, used to provide guaranteed delay bound and guaranteed throughput for class I. <p> We first obtain the average number of the queued downlink messages or uplink requests in the base station service queue which is given by E <ref> [ ^ N 1j ^ N &gt; 1] </ref> = n n ; (6.26) where ^ bsq n = m ^ m;n . <p> Note ( ^ N (t) 1) corresponds to the number of downlink messages or queued requests in the base station service queue for [E k ; E k+1 ). Now, the delay in the base station service queue is given using Little's theorem: D queue = E <ref> [ ^ N 1j ^ N &gt; 1] </ref>=G new ; (6.27) where G new = total = d + R succ u for the system to be stable.

Reference-contexts: Voice and video from low-priority sub-bands are examples of this class. Finally, class-III traffic like the conventional data service does require zero loss, but no bounded delay. Class III can also be divided further into two subclasses <ref> [11] </ref>: (1) class III-A which is delay-sensitive like FTP and remote log-in; and (2) class III-B which is delay-tolerable like paging and e-mail. Class III-A has priority over class III-B.

Reference-contexts: We define the traffic model of speech, and describe a scheme that utilizes the wireless link efficiently by transmitting class-III packets while the voice transmitter is in the silent mode. In a companion paper <ref> [15] </ref>, we also proposed another scheme for supporting QoS in a WLAN using a token allocation and slotted ALOHA. <p> mini-slot format (2) due to the alternating slot and mini-slot format, the maximum achievable throughput is expected to decrease while enabling us to schedule the uplink and downlink more dynamically and flexibly; (3) there are only a finite number of delay bound levels in contrast to the other scheme in <ref> [15] </ref> with virtually infinite delay bound levels; (4) using the framing strategy, the scheduling and admission test are much simpler; and (5) with the reservation scheme instead of slotted ALOHA, better delay and throughput performances of class-III traffic are attained. The paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: In this topology, the uplink (mobile-to-base) is not a broadcast channel while the downlink (base-to-mobile) is. Hence, mobile clients are not able to listen directly to other mobiles using the same frequency channel. This assumed situation can occur in real world due to the existence of hidden terminals <ref> [16] </ref>. As shown in Figure 2, the transmission ranges of mobile 1 and 2 do not allow them to hear each other, but can both be heard by the base station in between. The mobile 1 and 2 are hidden terminals to each other.

For uplink accesses using the reservation scheme, we use the model of K u clients. Our analysis will be based on the following assumptions. A1. The message length has a geometric distribution with parameter p len measured in the number of fixed-size packets. A2.

Usually, a combined channel coding and diversity scheme <ref> [18] </ref> is used to meet this need. To handle various types of traffic in our system, we can apply error-handling schemes adaptively. We adopt an ARQ (Automatic Retransmission Request) scheme for class III to ensure virtually error-free transmission of data.

Reference-contexts: The dual-mode receiver is expected to work well since using a channel code, the decoder can detect more errors than those correctable <ref> [19] </ref>. To ensure virtually error-free packet delivery, we assume that certain channel coding and diversity schemes with a dual-mode receiver (with an ARQ scheme) are used to combat noises, interferences, and multipath fadings.
