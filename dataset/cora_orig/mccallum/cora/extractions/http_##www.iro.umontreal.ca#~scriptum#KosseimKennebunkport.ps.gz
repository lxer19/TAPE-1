Title: Content and Rhetorical Status Selection in Instructional Texts

Abstract: This paper discusses an approach to planning the content of instructional texts. The research is based on a corpus study of 15 French procedural texts ranging from step-by-step device manuals to general artistic procedures. The approach taken starts from an AI task planner building a task representation, from which semantic carriers are selected. The most appropriate RST relations to communicate these carriers are then chosen according to heuristics developed during the corpus analysis.

Reference-contexts: Our view of instructional texts is rather larger than in other NLP research. For example, in <ref> [15, 12, 2] </ref> texts are restricted to execution-oriented instructions, where the reader is assumed to be the agent of the procedure. However, many texts that indicate how to perform a task are explanation-oriented and thus do not assume that the reader will immediately or even ever execute the procedure.

Reference-contexts: However, it cannot be applied directly in most other domains where the proportion of action sequences is lower. On the other hand, to explain a plan, [9] includes in the text all operations and hierarchical relations available in the task representation. No result, condition, negative imperative <ref> [3] </ref>, or other information found in naturally occurring texts are included.

Reference-contexts: However, many texts that indicate how to perform a task are explanation-oriented and thus do not assume that the reader will immediately or even ever execute the procedure. Our corpus thus ranges from step-by-step procedures (also called procedural directives <ref> [4] </ref> and linear explanations [5]), like device manuals to explanations-oriented texts like arts and crafts books. We performed an RST analysis only at the bottom level of the textual structure, that is at the inter- and intra-clausal levels.

Our efforts are aimed at developing heuristics guiding the selection of content and rhetorical status to produce "natural" instructions. We have emphasized two types of tasks. According to the classification of <ref> [5] </ref>, these are: operator tasks, ie. procedures on a system or device to accomplish a goal external to that system/device (eg. mowing the lawn); and maintenance/repair tasks, that is, specific operations on a system/device (eg. repairing a tape recorder). 3 The Corpus Analysis In order to generate "natural" texts, we first <p> However, many texts that indicate how to perform a task are explanation-oriented and thus do not assume that the reader will immediately or even ever execute the procedure.

It tries to transform the current state of the world, where the goal is not satisfied to a final state where the goal is true. The task planner takes as input a library of operation schemas and selects and orders a subset of these by constructing some task representation.
