Abstract: In a previous paper the authors showed that almost all labelled cubic graphs are hamiltonian. In the present paper, this result is used to show that almost all r-regular graphs are hamiltonian for any fixed r 3, by an analysis of the distribution of 1-factors in random regular graphs. Moreover, almost all such graphs are r-edge-colourable if they have an even number of vertices. Similarly, almost all r-regular bipartite graphs are hamiltonian and r-edge-colourable for fixed r 3. fl Research supported by the Australian Research Council

The obvious conjecture has been that this can be reduced to r 3. Previous early evidence for this was the result of the authors <ref> [5] </ref> that asymptotically at least 2 3e 13=12 of all cubic (3-regular) graphs are hamiltonian, using the standard second moment method applied to the number of Hamilton cycles of a triangle-free cubic graph. Then very recently, we showed [6] that almost all cubic graphs are hamiltonian. <p> For fixed r 3, almost all r-regular graphs with an even number of vertices are r-edge-colourable. In addition, the same proof works easily to give the analogous results for bipartite r-regular graphs. The case r = 3 was already proved in <ref> [5] </ref>. Theorem 3. For fixed r 3, almost all r-regular bipartite graphs have a complete decomposition. Corollary. For fixed r 3, almost all r-regular bipartite graphs are hamil-tonian and r-edge-colourable. not 2 Proof of Theorem 2 The proof is by induction on r. <p> From <ref> [5, proofs of Theorems 2.3 and 2.4] </ref>, k = 2n=3 + o (n) almost surely as n ! 1. More loosely expressed, this says that the two distinguished Hamilton cycles almost surely have roughly 4n=3 edges in common.

For fixed r 3, almost all r-regular graphs are hamiltonian. We could presumably use the method in <ref> [6] </ref> to prove Theorem 1 directly. In this, it would be reasonable to expect that due to greater edge density, the case r 4 would be easier than r = 3. <p> The approach of the present paper begins by following that in <ref> [6] </ref>, but with regard to perfect matchings instead of Hamilton cycles: divide the graphs G in into groups according to the values of the variables X i for i = 3; : : : ; b, where b 3, then refine the second moment method for M using these groups. <p> A cubic graph with a Hamilton cycle must have a complete decomposition, and so the validity of Theorem 2 for r = 3 comes from the main result of <ref> [6] </ref>.

The probability that G 2 fl 2n has a complete decomposition in which the Hamilton cycle contains the first distinguished edge but no other distinguished edge tends to 1 as n ! 1. Proof. The first step is to modify the Theorem of <ref> [6] </ref>. So for the moment, take r = 3, so that all graphs are cubic.

Let ^ M denote the number of perfect matchings of a graph G 2 fl which do not contain any of the j distinguished edges of G.

Firstly, Exp fl (r 1) j r j ExpM: Secondly, from [3, proof of Theorem 3], for a random labelled r-regular graph with 2n vertices and two distinguished perfect matchings, the number of edges in the intersection of the matchings is almost surely asymptotic to n=r.
