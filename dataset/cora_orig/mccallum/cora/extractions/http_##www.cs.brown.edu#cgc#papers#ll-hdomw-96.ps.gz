Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of characterizing those graphs that can be drawn as minimum weight triangulations and answer the question for maximal outerplanar graphs. We provide a complete characterization of minimum weight triangulations of regular polygons by studying the combinatorial properties of their dual trees. We exploit this characterization to devise a linear time (real RAM) algorithm that receives as input a maximal outerplanar graph G and produces as output a straight-line drawing of G that is a minimum weight triangulation of the set of points representing the vertices of G.

Reference-contexts: The drawing algorithm exploits the combinatorial properties of the minimum weight triangulations of regular polygons and is based on a decomposition rule of minimum weight triangulations. 2 Preliminaries We assume familiarity with the basic terminology of graph theory and computational geometry (see also Bondy and Murty <ref> [2] </ref>, and Preparata and Shamos [21]). A graph G is outerplanar if it has a planar embedding such that all vertices lie on a single face. G is maximal outerplanar if G is outerplanar, but the addition of any new edge results in a non-outerplanar graph.

Reference-contexts: Drawings that follow such a standard are called straight-line drawings and the design of algorithms to produce such drawings is a field of growing interest. An extensive survey of results on straight-line drawings as well as on other graphic standards is provided by Di Battista et al. <ref> [3] </ref>. Recently, attention has been devoted to a special type of straight-line drawings, called minimum weight drawings, which have applications in areas including computational geometry and numerical analysis. Let C be a class of graphs, let P be a set of points in the plane.

Reference-contexts: In the same paper it is shown that no tree having at least one vertex with degree greater than six can be drawn as a minimum spanning tree. As for trees having maximum degree equal to six, Eades and Whitesides <ref> [5] </ref> showed that it is NP-hard to decide whether such trees can be drawn as minimum spanning trees. Surprisingly, nothing seems to be known about the problem of constructing a minimum weight drawing of a planar triangulation.

Reference-contexts: Surprisingly, nothing seems to be known about the problem of constructing a minimum weight drawing of a planar triangulation. Moreover, it is still not known whether computing a minimum weight triangulation of a set of points in the plane is an NP-complete problem (see Garey and Johnson <ref> [6] </ref>). Several papers have been published on this last problem, either providing partial solutions, or giving efficient approximation heuristics.

Reference-contexts: When arbitrary convex polygons are considered, the fastest known algorithms require O (n 3 ) time, where n is the number of vertices of the polygon (see Gilbert <ref> [7] </ref>, Klincsek [11], and Heath and Pemmaraju [8]).
