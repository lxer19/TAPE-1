Abstract: We are investigating ways in which media space technologies can support distributed work groups through access to information that supports general awareness. Awareness involves knowing who is around, what activities are occurring, who is talking with whom; it provides a view of one another in the daily work environments. Awareness may lead to informal interactions, spontaneous connections, and the development of shared culturesall important aspects of maintaining working relationships which are denied to groups distributed across multiple sites.

Reference-contexts: While sitting at a desk, we are aware of activities going on around uswe hear the sounds of conversations in corridors, see people as they pass by, notice people in offices as we walk down a hallway, and so forth. The Polyscope system at EuroPARC <ref> [2] </ref> and the Imager system at PARC were attempts to capture some of this information in the respective media spaces. The basic approach that each took was to present regularly-updated digitised video images from locations around the media space on the workstation screen.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATIONS Reports on the use of media space technology (e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>, [5], [6], [8], [10], [11]) typically focus on the use of direct audio and video connections as an aid to collaboration among remotely located individuals. The emphasis on real-time connections is not surprising; such uses are highly visible and identifiable mechanisms through which remote collaboration can be enhanced.

Reference-contexts: The emphasis on real-time connections is not surprising; such uses are highly visible and identifiable mechanisms through which remote collaboration can be enhanced. However, our experiences of using media space technology at Rank Xerox EuroPARC <ref> [4] </ref> and at Xerox PARC [9] have also pointed to the importance of a different style of connection.
