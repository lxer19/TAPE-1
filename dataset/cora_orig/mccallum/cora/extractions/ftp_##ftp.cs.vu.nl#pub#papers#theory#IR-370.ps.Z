Abstract: Our main aim is to review the frame semantics and axiomatics of modal logic from the perspective of the duality between (Kripke) frames and boolean algebras with operators as defined by Jonsson and Tarski. To this end, we introduce modal languages and their interpretation in models and frames in Part II. We define and discuss the notion of a modal formula characterizing a class of frames or models, and give the Sahlqvist algorithm which yields, given a suitable modal formula as input, the corresponding first-order frame condition of the class of frames characterized by the modal formula. We define the concept of a normal modal logic and work out the canonical frame method for proving completeness of a logic with respect to a class of frames. In Part III we develop the algebraic perspective on modal logic. We introduce boolean algebras with operators and show how they arise naturally in both the semantic and the axiomatic approach towards algebraizing modal logic. We discuss in detail how the category of boolean algebras with operators and homomorphisms links up with the category of frames with so-called bounded morphisms. Finally, we apply this duality to give easy proofs for some important and well-known results from modal logic. AMS Subject Classification (1991): 03B45, 03G25, 03G15, 06E25. CR Subject Classification (1991): F.4.0, F.4.1, I.2.3, I.2.4. Keywords & Phrases: Modal logic, algebraic logic, boolean algebras with operators, duality theory, deduction, knowledge representation formalisms. Note: This report is loosely based on parts of Blackburn, de Rijke and Venema [4]; the material was used as lecture notes for a course on Modal Logic and Boolean Algebras with Operators given by the third author during the summer school on Algebraic Logic and the Method of Applying It (Budapest, July 11-17 1994), which was held as part of the TEMPUS summer school series `Algebraic and Categorial Methods in Computer Science.' It has been a long time since modal logic involved only the study of extensions of classical propositional logic with one operator `2' referring to the necessity of truth of a formula. Nowadays, modal logicians are studying a variety of modal languages and interpretations for them, each system designed to formalize some aspect of linguistic, computational, mathematical or philosophical reasoning, and it has become increasingly hard to indicate what these

Part I: Introduction It has been a long time since modal logic involved only the study of extensions of classical propositional logic with one operator `2' referring to the <p> Theorem 2.24 Let t be the basic modal similarity type. A class K is definable within the class of transitive finite t -frames if and only if K is closed under taking bounded morphic images, generated subframes and (finite) disjoint unions. Proof. See Blackburn, de Rijke and Venema <ref> [4, Chapter 3] </ref>. a In general however, a frame class has to satisfy more closure conditions in order to be modally definable. <p> A proper treatment of the concept of strong completeness would involve an interesting but lengthy discussion on the various ways of defining and algebraizing the modal consequence relation j= and the derivability relation ` . For details we refer the reader to <ref> [4] </ref>. 6. Basic duality 43 if every Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra of K is representable as a complex algebra, then K is complete with respect to the class of all frames. (5.27) So, assume that L K () is representable as a complex algebra. <p> Then F has an ultrapower Q U F such that Q F U F Z Z Proof.

Then validity of is preserved under taking ultrafilter extensions. 6. Basic duality 52 Proof. <p> Then G is a bounded morphic image of a disjoint union of ultraproducts of frames in K. For a proof of this Fact, which is essentially a result of Goldblatt, we refer to [15] or <ref> [4] </ref>. Now assume that A is V K = HSPCmK. In other words, there are a family fF i j i 2 Ig of frames in K and an algebra B such that 7.

Reference-contexts: Worse still, there are modal logics for which no completeness result with respect to frames can be given at all.

Finally, Blok <ref> [5] </ref> shows that there is a continuum of distinct incomplete extensions of KT. Part III: An algebraic perspective In the second Part of our notes we will develop an alternative, algebraic semantics for modal logic. <p> Another important issue on the borderline between modal logic and boolean algebras with operators is the lattice of modal logics. The observation that the lattice of normal extensions of K is dually isomorphic to the lattice of subvarieties of the variety of modal algebras has been used by Blok <ref> [5] </ref> to invoke powerful results from the theory of lattices of varieties. As a consequence, one can get strong results on incompleteness, or on tabular and pretabular logics. Finally, in these notes we concentrated on normal modal logics whose semantics employ arbitrary relations.

Algebraizing modal logic As usual in algebraic logic, there are two approaches towards the algebraization of modal logic: a semantic approach based on the connections between frames and boolean algebras with operators, and a more syntactic, axiomatic approach relating logics to equational theories.

Reference-contexts: What we then get is a categorial duality between modal algebras and general frames. We refer the reader to Goldblatt's <ref> [12] </ref> for further details on the duality between frames and boolean algebras with operators. In these notes we exploited the connection between frames and algebras mainly to get completeness results. But the connection can exploited to transfer many more results between logics and algebras.

Reference-contexts: Now, applying Birkhoff's result through the channel of duality theory, (and with some additional modal reasoning), Goldblatt and Thomason <ref> [13] </ref> give an analogous structural characterization of the frame classes that are modally definable (Theorem 7.2). Finally, we should mention that results are also being transferred in the opposite direction, i.e., from modal logic to the theory of boolean algebras with operators.

Reference-contexts: Recall that in the previous subsection, we already hinted that every boolean algebra with operators is isomorphic to a complex algebra. This fundamental result in the algebraization of modal logic, which is due to Jonsson and Tarski <ref> [17] </ref>, will be discussed and proved in the next section. 6. Basic duality In this section, which really forms the heart of these lecture notes, we will show how to link up boolean algebras with operators with frames. <p> Definition 6.7 Let t be a modal similarity type, and C a class of boolean algebras with t -operators. C is canonical if it closed under taking canonical embedding algebras, i.e., if for all algebras A, EmA is in C if A is in C. In the original paper <ref> [17] </ref>, Jonsson and Tarski proved (by algebraic and topological means) that classes of BAOs axiomatized by special kinds of (quasi-)equations are canonical. This important result can be derived as a corollary to our Theorem 7.4 below. <p> A very important paper with implications for modal logic is Jonsson and Tarski's paper of 1951 <ref> [17] </ref>. If it had been widely read when it was published, the history of modal logic might have looked different. This paper extends the Stone duality for boolean algebras (see, for example, [21]) to boolean algebras with operators.

Often the main motivation for using (propositional) modal logic in either of the above two uses is their flexibility, their naturalness and the fact that in many cases they have better computational properties than richer formalisms such as first-order logic.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, Theorem 7.4 implies that the variety generated by SQ is canonical. This variety is well-known in the literature on algebraic logic as the variety RRA of Representable Relation Algebras (cf. <ref> [20] </ref>). Rephrased in terminology from modal logic, Theorem 7.4 boils down to the following result, originally due to Fine (for the standard similarity type): Corollary 7.7 Let t be modal similarity type, and K be a class of t -frames which is closed under ultraproducts. <p> References 60 We refer the reader to Nemeti <ref> [20] </ref>, and Blok and Pigozzi [6] for further details on algebraic counterparts of logical properties.

This paper extends the Stone duality for boolean algebras (see, for example, <ref> [21] </ref>) to boolean algebras with operators. Moreover, the paper shows that to get a full duality between modal frames and modal algebras one needs to consider so-called general frames.

Reference-contexts: It consists in first taking the canonical model, and then applying various constructions to massage it into a model based on a frame that has the required properties. The method has proved particularly useful in temporal logic (cf. Segerberg <ref> [23] </ref>). Using the finite canonical model method and the Segerberg method, it is possible to establish many completeness results that escape the ordinary canonical model method. However, these methods have limitations too.
