Title: Parallel Real-Time Videotransmission over Lossy Channels  
Author: Christoph Gunzel Falko Riemenschneider Jurgen Wirtgen 
Abstract: We present a construction to transmit high quality video streams, such as MPEG-video in realtime over lossy channels. To protect our messages against losses in the network during transit we use a new Forward Error Correction (FEC) scheme called ERT [G 96]. Unfortunately a lot of losses are not caused by the network itself but by buffer overflows in the receivermachine when the receiver is not as fast as the sender. In this case we do not use a single machine as the receiver but a cluster of workstations. fl Dept. of Computer Science, University of Bonn, 53117 Bonn, Germany.

Reference-contexts: Therefore we have to protect our messsage against losses in the network during transmission. Here we use a mechanism called ERT (Error Resilient Transmission). ERT is a Forward Error Correction scheme with several priority levels. It is based on PET (Priority Encoding Transmission) designed at ICSI [BKK + 95] <ref> [ABE + 94] </ref>. With this method one can initially transmit extra redundant information along with the raw message so that the message can be recovered from any sufficiently large fraction of the transmission. <p> Here we use a Forward Error Correction scheme 3 called ERT. ERT is an approach to the transmission of prioritized information over lossy packet-switched networks. It is based on PET (Priority Encoding Transmission) designed at ICSI [BKK + 95] <ref> [ABE + 94] </ref>. The basic idea is that the source assigns different priorities to different segments of data. ERT encodes the data using multi-level redundancy and disperses the encoding into the packets to be transmitted.

Reference-contexts: It is useful for applications dealing with realtime transport streams like video or audio in a lossy environment. Such streams for example MPEG-video streams consist of several data parts with different importance <ref> [Le 94] </ref>. ERT allows to protect those parts with appropriate redundancy and thus guarantees, that the more important parts arrive before the less important ones.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In many communication situations, data is lost in transit. A standard response to this problem is to request retransmission of data that is not received. The network transport protocol TCP <ref> [St 94] </ref> deals with that error correction scheme. When some of this retransmission is lost, another request is made and so on. Such communication protocols like TCP are often the source of delays in networks and are a disadvantage for realtime applications. <p> <ref> [St 94] </ref> deals with that error correction scheme. When some of this retransmission is lost, another request is made and so on. Such communication protocols like TCP are often the source of delays in networks and are a disadvantage for realtime applications. To avoid these delays we use the UDP [St 94] protocol in our construction. The UDP protocol does not have an error correction mechanism. Therefore we have to protect our messsage against losses in the network during transmission. Here we use a mechanism called ERT (Error Resilient Transmission).
