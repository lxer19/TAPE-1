Abstract: In this paper we present two approaches to deal with degradation of automatic speech recognizers due to acoustic mismatch in training and testing environments. The first approach is based on the multi-band approach to automatic speech recognition (ASR). This approach is shown to be inherently robust to frequency selective degradation. In the second approach, we present a conceptually simple unsupervised feature adaptation technique, based on recursive estimation of means and variances of the cepstral parameters to compensate for the noise effects. Both techniques yield significant reduction in error rates.

Reference-contexts: The cepstral mean subtraction (CMS) technique as well as the RASTA [8] technique were introduced to compensate for the changes in means of the parameters at the feature level. Though several dynamic adaptation schemes ( <ref> [10, 11, 1] </ref>) are being used to adapt both the means and variances of features and acoustic models to changing environmental conditions, most of these approaches are based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods in the HMM framework.

Reference-contexts: One approach towards addressing this problem, is to understand the robust mechanism of the human speech recognition system and try to incorporate it into the ASR model. Fletcher's work <ref> [2] </ref> on articulatory index suggests that in humans, the linguistic message gets decoded independently in different frequency sub-bands and the final decoding is based on merging the decisions from the sub-bands.

Reference-contexts: This supports the notion that if some frequency sub-band carries unreliable information (possibly due to noise) it could be de-emphasized in the final merging. Our first approach towards robust ASR, the multi-band approach <ref> [9, 3] </ref> is motivated by this idea. We show that this approach is robust towards noise which selectively corrupts only a few regions of the frequency spectrum. Another approach towards addressing the problem, is to characterize the adverse effect of the interfering noise. <p> The training set consists of 150 speakers and 50 speakers comprise the test set. Each speaker has uttered the vocabulary once. The classifiers used are the phoneme-based HMM/MLP hybrid classifiers [4]. 3. MULTI-BAND ASR APPROACH The multi-band approach <ref> [9, 3] </ref> to automatic speech recognition is illustrated in Fig. 1. In our multi-band model the frequency spectrum is divided into 7 sub bands, each sub-band comprising of about two crit-ical bands.

Reference-contexts: In our multi-band model the frequency spectrum is divided into 7 sub bands, each sub-band comprising of about two crit-ical bands. The features in each sub-band are the cepstra obtained from the all-pole modeling of the PLP <ref> [7] </ref> cube-root compressed and equalized (equal-loudness equalization) critical band energies. Independent probability estimation for each class (phoneme) is conducted in each sub-band using a MLP.
