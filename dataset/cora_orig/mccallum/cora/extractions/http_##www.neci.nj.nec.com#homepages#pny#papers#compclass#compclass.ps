Reference-contexts: The probability that a sequence could have been generated by choosing random phrases from our dictionary may be understood as P r (Sjd), conditional probability of the sequence, given the dictionary <ref> [1] </ref>. The entropy of the sequence is E = log 2 P r (sjd), and can be understood as the smallest number of bits to which the sequence may be compressed such that the compressed sequence and the dictionary together are sufficient to reconstitute the original sequence [32]. <p> In place of a dictionary, any stochastic method for generating appropriate sequences may suffice, including Markov models <ref> [1] </ref>, stochastic choice among an infinite set of algorithms [16], or a corpus of sequences [19]. Therefore, the number of bits to which a model can compress a sequence may be used to calculate the probability that the sequence could have been generated from the model. <p> We tested the effect of relaxing this assumption. Tryeach!nbias extended tryeach-near! by replacing the pointers of form (i; l; o) with pointers of form (i; p; o), where p was a cumulative probability associated with the match, such that the length of p using arithmetic coding <ref> [1] </ref> would increase for matches found in few sequences and decrease for matches found in many. Similarly, tryeach!rbias used p such that the length of p increased for more common matches, and tryeach!bbias maximized the length of p for both rare and common matches.

Reference-contexts: Different approaches have been employed to define the consensus sequence of various DNA binding sites, including promoters, and to then use this consensus to locate members of that sequence family. These include using frequency ratios [14], consensus frequency tables [22], information theory [29], analogies to statistical mechanics <ref> [2] </ref>, and methods that combine these [34, 37, 24, 25].

Reference-contexts: The problem is typically stated as distinguishing two or more classes of sequences, given a corpus of labelled training examples. Many standard machine learning algorithms have been applied to problems within this domain, including C4.5 [15] and artificial neural networks <ref> [3, 33] </ref>. The majority of such work treats individual nucleotides positions as attributes and applies algorithms that attempt to construct a classifier that considers each attribute individually. <p> Such sequence conservation serves as the basis both for proposed mechanisms [35] as well as evolutionary inference [31]. The most successful efforts to date to create splice junction classifiers have employed artificial neural networks <ref> [3] </ref>. Our data set was a selection of 719 Splice-junction donors from the STATLOG DNA dataset, derived from Genbank 64.1 primate data, using nominal (A,C,G,T) rather than numeric attributes. This dataset is substantially the same used in [23].

Reference-contexts: Similarly, tryeach!rbias used p such that the length of p increased for more common matches, and tryeach!bbias maximized the length of p for both rare and common matches. Tryeach!fstar used the F* statistic described in <ref> [4] </ref> to increase p as jF fl j ! 1; that is, p was small when the match was much more common or much rarer than would be expected for a sequence of its length and composition. 4 Experiment Design and Results This paper describes our on-going efforts at using compression-based

Reference-contexts: Textual substitution methods have been used to characterize DNA in [21, 20]. Hidden Markov chain models have been to characterize DNA in <ref> [26, 5] </ref>. Complexity estimates based upon repetition vectors have been used to estimate entropy to characterize exons and introns [27] and protein residue clusters [38]. It is important to improve our understanding of the relationship between these efforts and our own.

Reference-contexts: We note in passing that this is a more complete set than represented in other recent studies <ref> [6, 17] </ref>, which use an older and more restricted set (typically only bacterial promoters, or only the pre-aligned -10 and -35 regions). This set thus includes transposon and plasmid promoters, as well as promoters created by fusion or mutation. <p> An initial concern of ours was the construction of "negative" examples (sequences which contained no promoters). Most studies randomly permute sequences in an effort to derive examples which do not meet consensus criteria, but nonetheless retain the correct nucleotide - 7 - frequencies <ref> [6, 17] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Were promoters constituted solely by the -35 and -10 sequence at this level of match stringency, they would occur in one or the other direction approximately every 200 bases in a random sequence <ref> [7] </ref> | a much higher frequency than is found. As a result, most of the analysis techniques referred to above generate a superset of candidate promoters, then use a series of ad hoc filters to reduce the number of false positives (for an example, see [25]). <p> Most studies randomly permute sequences in an effort to derive examples which do not meet consensus criteria, but nonetheless retain the correct nucleotide - 7 - frequencies [6, 17]. DNA, however, is known to be highly non-random <ref> [7] </ref> | therefore negative training examples were derived by selecting contiguous subsequences from randomly selected and non-overlapping coding sequences in the Genbank E. coli collection, specifically coding regions of ECORGNB, ECORPLRPM, ECORPOA, ECORPSOP, ECORPSRPO, ECORPST, ECORPSTA, ECORPSU, ECORRFX, ECORRNH, and their complements.

Reference-contexts: First, we are investigating the reasons underlying the differential classification success between promoters and splice junctions. Secondly, the compression methods that we used are incremental, and it is important to understand how the convergence rates of the underlying compression techniques affect the results of CBI. (cf <ref> [8] </ref>) Finally, there are other efforts that bear many similarities to this work. Textual substitution methods have been used to characterize DNA in [21, 20]. Hidden Markov chain models have been to characterize DNA in [26, 5].

Reference-contexts: This method is related to a method of calculating similarity seen, for example, in [30]. It was felt likely that the same biologically interesting feature could vary significantly from one sequence to another, as for example the various features in prokaryotic promoters <ref> [9] </ref>. To account for this variance, it was decided to explore replacing exact text compression with a lossy technique. <p> These include using frequency ratios [14], consensus frequency tables [22], information theory [29], analogies to statistical mechanics [2], and methods that combine these [34, 37, 24, 25]. Inspired by such consensus specifications, a number of algorithms have been proposed for the recognition of promoters <ref> [28, 9, 22] </ref>; most of which rely on specific agreement with conserved regions within the -10 and -35 regions of promoter sequences (numbering refers to the approximate position upstream of the first transcribed base).

Reference-contexts: average E. coli bacterial or phage promoter matches only 3.9 bases of the -35 consensus (TTGACA) and 4.2 bases of the -10 consensus (TATAAT), whereas a sequence of at least 11 bases is nominally required for unique iden tification in a random sequence the size of the E. coli genome <ref> [10] </ref>. Even allowing for the fact that this criterion may be too stringent (the genome is not random DNA), the observed specification of 8 out of 12 bases is relatively quite degenerate.

Reference-contexts: A consensus sequence, therefore, cannot automatically be used as a pattern recognizer for genetic sequences. In fact, if the 12 bases of the "perfect" Hawley consensus is used as a screen, no promoters are matched in a recent compilation <ref> [13] </ref>. For our first task, we chose to distinguish bacterial promoter sequences from non-promoter sequences. We used 291 sample promoters and 291 nonpromoter sequences. The 291 sample promoters were obtained from a compilation produced by Harley and Reynolds [13], and were all E. coli promoters for which transcriptional start points had <p> used as a screen, no promoters are matched in a recent compilation <ref> [13] </ref>.

For example, our earliest attempts applied the zdiff algorithm (described below) to the data used in <ref> [15] </ref>. However, it was discovered that there was a flaw | the estimated true error rate was less than 0.1%! Analysis revealed that the cause of this error was a bias in the negative training data.

The Hamming distance was expressed using a prefix code <ref> [16, p. 12] </ref>, so that smaller Hamming distances were encoded as shorter codes. 3.2 Encoding Feature-Ordering Information in Pointers The above methods use no biological information other than the fact that DNA sequences are, in fact, sequences of characters drawn from a finite alphabet.

The most successful efforts to date to create splice junction classifiers have employed artificial neural networks [3].

Reference-contexts: The compressed length of the test example given the training set is then calculated as I (tjS) = I (t; S) I (S). All subsequent methods use a textual substitution method for compression <ref> [36] </ref>, rather than the Ziv-Lempel dictionary method. This method was determined to be simpler to modify as we explored different methods of representing various types of domain knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Textual substitution methods have been used to characterize DNA in [21, 20]. Hidden Markov chain models have been to characterize DNA in [26, 5]. Complexity estimates based upon repetition vectors have been used to estimate entropy to characterize exons and introns [27] and protein residue clusters <ref> [38] </ref>. It is important to improve our understanding of the relationship between these efforts and our own.

Reference-contexts: from the way compression is used in CBI, to the encoding of features of interest within the compression method, and finally to the merging of compression with non-compressive techniques for separating meaningful features from spurious ones. 3.1 Compression Variations Our initial method, zdiff, is an application the well-known LZ78 algorithm <ref> [39] </ref>. The training examples for each category are simply concatenated (separated by line feeds), and compressed, yielding I (S), where S is either S + or S . The concatenated training examples are then concatenated with each test example individually, and compressed, yielding I (t; S).
