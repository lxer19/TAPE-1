Abstract: We apply morphing to the problem of generating the initial mesh for finite element simulations. This algorithm reduces mesh adaptation time by integrating physical and geometric constraints to provide a near optimal initial mesh. We apply this method to large-scale bioelectric field problems involving the complex geometries of the human body.

Reference-contexts: The intermediate interpolated shapes are resampled in space and "time" to provide the actual mesh points. For models with simple topologies, this method produces results similar to mapping methods for grid generation <ref> [3] </ref>. However, as we will demonstrate, the morphing method is also capable of handling domains with complex topologies. Methods As an initial testbed, we have constructed an algorithm to generate meshes for a two-dimensional slice of our thorax data.

Reference-contexts: In two dimensions, the boundaries of the voltage sources, current sources, internal geometries, and the exterior of the model are closed planar curves. A curve in two-dimensional space may be represented in several different ways. These representations can be divided into three classes: parametric, explicit, and implicit <ref> [4] </ref>. For this application, we will exploit the properties of the implicit repre 3 sentation in order to perform shape interpolation. Let f 1 and f 2 be the implicit representations of two curves, c 1 and c 2 .
