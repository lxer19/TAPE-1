Reference-contexts: The drips decision-theoretic refinement planning system automates the process of decision tree construction and evaluation. The system uses abstraction to explore a large space of possible plans efficiently; it composes individual action descriptions to create decision trees <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> . The system can reason about discrete and continuous attributes, as well as about time. It finds the plan or plans that maximize the expected value of a user-defined utility function. With these capabilities, drips provides a mechanism to identify optimal plans involving diagnosis and treatment. <p> Such pruning is important to gain computational efficiency in large models. Theoretical analysis shows that with an appropriate abstraction hierarchy, the runtime complexity of drips is exponentially better than that of exhaustive enumeration <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> . In order to demonstrate the efficiency of drips in practice, we compared it to a standard branch-and-bound algorithm for evaluating decision trees. Any decision problem can be represented by a decision tree in which the only chance nodes are at the leaves.

Reference-contexts: To study the applicability of this technique to medical decision making, we applied drips to data from a published analysis of management of acute lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT), in which 24 decision trees (out of a space of 6,206 possible trees) were evaluated <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> . Acute Deep Venous Thrombosis Appropriate management of patients with suspected acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities remains an important and complex clinical problem. The clinical findings of DVT do not permit diagnosis with certainty [ 3, 4 ] . <p> To evaluate the applicability of drips to medical decision making, we constructed a model for diagnosis and treatment of DVT. Our model was based on data from an article that compared 24 different management strategies <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> . We chose this manuscript because it contained explicit probability and utility data, and because we hoped to show the advantage of our technique over the manual construction of decision trees. <p> Since drips only eliminates plans that it can prove are suboptimal and if run to completion it explores the entire space of possible plans, it is guaranteed to find the optimal plan or plans. Results Based on the "standard model" assumptions of the original model <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> , in which the cost of a fatal event was set at $30,000, drips determined that the plan with the highest expected utility was their Strategy A, "No Tests, No Treatment." This plan differed from the one 6 identified in the reference article, namely, "RUS, Treat if RUS

Reference-contexts: Acute Deep Venous Thrombosis Appropriate management of patients with suspected acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities remains an important and complex clinical problem. The clinical findings of DVT do not permit diagnosis with certainty <ref> [ 3, 4 ] </ref> . Unchecked, lower-extremity DVT can progress to pulmonary embolism, a condition that entails significant morbidity and mortality. Anticoagulation therapy for DVT is expensive and carries the risk of severe hemorrhage. Even diagnostic procedures such as venography entail risks such as contrast reaction and iatrogenic DVT.

Reference-contexts: Although these tests are assumed to take no time, action effects may also specify temporal duration. Our action representation is similar to that introduced by Hanks <ref> [ 5 ] </ref> . The probabilities of the initial world states (prior probabilities), as well as the probabilistic effects of all the primitive actions in the DVT domain are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The drips planner uses a temporal utility model that represents the utilities of time streams.

Reference-contexts: The drips planner uses a temporal utility model that represents the utilities of time streams. The utility model can express both partially satisfiable deadline goals (achieve a condition by a time) and maintenance goals (maintain a condition over a period of time) <ref> [ 6, 7 ] </ref> . In our analysis, we used a simple nontemporal utility function, which was defined as the sum of the costs of tests and treatment and the costs associated with the state of the patient at the end of the plan.

Reference-contexts: Thus the effect is realized with a probability in the range [.90 .98]. For these two actions the conditions on the grouped branches are identical, so the abstract branch is labeled with that condition. In general, grouped branches need not have the same condition. Haddawy and Doan <ref> [ 8 ] </ref> describe the general theory for abstracting probabilistic actions used by the drips planner. 5 The drips Algorithm drips finds the optimal plan by building abstract plans, comparing them, and refining only those that might yield the optimal plan.

Reference-contexts: In fact, for several plans, drips calculated expected utility values that differed from those published in the reference article. In attempting to resolve this discrepancy, we discovered that at least one of the 24 decision trees constructed by Hillner and colleagues was incorrect <ref> [ 9 ] </ref> . We studied the effect of the cost of a fatal event on the selection of the optimal management plan (Figure 3).

Reference-contexts: To compare the performance of drips to that of decision trees, we built software that uses the primitive action descriptions to generate a decision tree representing all possible plans and evaluates it using branch-and-bound techniques <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> to find the optimal plan. In order to make the comparison fair, both drips and the decision tree algorithm were implemented in the CommonLisp programming languange and analyses were run on the same machine. branch-and-bound algorithm at all values.

Reference-contexts: Our method of representing abstract actions is similar to that of Chrisman <ref> [ 11 ] </ref> . He represents the uncertainty in the effects of an abstract action by using Dempster-Shafer intervals. He derives a closed-form projection rule that works by finding the convex hull of possible poststate probability distributions.

Reference-contexts: He derives a closed-form projection rule that works by finding the convex hull of possible poststate probability distributions. Although his actions can include conditions, he does not show how to abstract the conditions. His approach assumes attributes have finite domains, while ours does not. Wellman's SUDO-PLANNER system <ref> [ 12 ] </ref> uses decision-theoretic principles to eliminate classes of suboptimal plans in domains characterized by partially satisfiable goals and actions with uncertain effects. It eliminates only those classes of plans which it can prove are dominated without resorting to reasoning about tradeoffs.
