Abstract: An explicit quantitative approach to this problem requires (a) a priori information about the interior geometry of the car and the calibration of the camera, and (b) accurate computation of the subject's location and gaze direction. This paper describes a more qualitative approach. The subject is observed over an extended period of time, and a "pose-space histogram" is used to record the frequency with which particular head poses occur. For observation of a car driver, peaks will appear in the histogram according to the frequently viewed directions of straight-ahead, toward the dashboard, and the mirrors. Each peak is labelled, and the focus of attention of the driver in all subsequent images is then classified by use of the histogram.

Reference-contexts: We discuss situations where head pose alone is insufficient for the application, plus extension of the work to handle eye direction in Section 6. The algorithms used are appropriate for the Artificial Retina camera <ref> [3] </ref>, a low-cost (a few tens of dollars) image detector which has programmable on-chip processing. We have a version with a 32x32 detector array, and so employed algorithms which are able to give useful results at coarse image resolutions. The next section is an overview of our approach.

Reference-contexts: For homogeneous quantities `=' indicates equality up to a non-zero scale factor. In a Euclidean coordinate frame, P can be decomposed as P = C [Rj RT] (3) where C is the camera matrix <ref> [4] </ref>. An image pixel x backprojects to a ray in the world coordinate frame described by X = T 0 (4) where D = (d x ; d y ; d z ) = R 1 C 1 x (5) Substituting into equation (1) gives a quadratic in , construction.
