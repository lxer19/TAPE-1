Title: Technical Innovations deployed by the MERCI Project  
Author: Peter T. Kirstein Roy Bennett 
Abstract: The paper reviews some of the important recent developments within the MERCI project in the technical improvement and deployment of Multimedia conferencing. The developments address four of the known limitations of the Mbone technology heretofore: lack of security, absence of QoS guarantees, inability to interwork with conferences using the ITU-T standards and lack of good access over low bandwidth unicast links. Description of the developments is coupled with a discussion of future improvements and plans for further deployment.

Reference-contexts: This paper reviews several technical innovations which have been introduced in pilot operations in Europe to improve usability and describes our plans to improve them and to further deploy them. 2. Piloting of RSVP A number of the MERCI partners have ongoing pilot activities in the deployment of RSVP <ref> [1] </ref>. The aim of this work is to improve the quality of MBONE conferencing by providing Quality of Service guarantees to users. The project as a whole will run RSVP on its dedicated European Mbone links over JAMES, extending these within countries as conditions allow.

Reference-contexts: While it might have been possible to do this in a tool-independent way using secure IP (IPSEC) <ref> [2] </ref>, the extent to which this will be implemented in IPv4, and the timescale of the implementation, were too uncertain for our purposes.
Reference: [3] <author> National Bureau of Standards: </author> <title> "Data Encryption Standard" FIPS 46, Government Printing Office, </title> <address> Washington, </address> <year> 1977. </year>
Reference-contexts: The media tools themselves require the provision of information specifying the encryption algorithm used, other parameters to describe the encryption and the encryption key. In the only version of this implemented so far for the MERCI tools, the encryption algorithm used is the symmetric single DES <ref> [3] </ref>, and the only parameter needed is the encryption key. In each case, we are using an initiation vector and an encryption key.

Reference-contexts: In each case, we are using an initiation vector and an encryption key. The developers of the tools have agreed to pass information about the symmetric key in the form of a PassPhrase; this is conformant to <ref> [4] </ref>, which has been agreed in the IETF.
Reference: [5] <author> Rivest, </author> <title> R : "The MD5 MessageDigest Algorithm", RFC 1321, </title> <publisher> MIT, </publisher> <month> April </month> <year> 1992. </year>
Reference-contexts: The developers of the tools have agreed to pass information about the symmetric key in the form of a PassPhrase; this is conformant to [4], which has been agreed in the IETF. This PassPhrase is passed through an MD5 <ref> [5] </ref> module, to ensure true randomness of the encryption key; the first 56 bits after passing through the module are used as the Encryption Key; this mechanism has been built into the above existing media tools.

Reference-contexts: There are also secured versions of the shared workspace tools WB and NTE. 3.2 Security at the Session level 3.2.1 Secured SAP Conference control and security functionality are intricately related, and the SAP, SDP and SIP protocols all include explicit security mechanisms to perform key exchange for multicast sessions <ref> [6 ] </ref>. The security requirements and implementations require full papers by themselves; these are being prepared, but are not yet available.

Reference-contexts: Thus only persons holding the group Secret Key can decrypt the Header, and thus the announcement. In both cases, initial implementations use both PGP and X.509 versions of the system <ref> [7] </ref>. PGP is made available because the PGP software is fairly widely used, and X.509 [8] versions of certificates are used because such an infrastructure is envisaged both in the IETF and the European ICETEL [9] project. We are still experimenting with different methods of key distribution.

Reference-contexts: We are still experimenting with different methods of key distribution. We expect to use three methods of key distribution: Secured WWW access, Secured Email and Secured X.509 Directory access. Further details are presented in <ref> [10] </ref>. 3.2.2 Secured SIP In addition to announcing public sessions as a table of contents, an alternative mechanism to initiate multimedia sessions follows a telephone style analogy - a user wishes to call another user to start a session immediately.
Reference: [11] <author> Schulzrinne, </author> <title> H : "Simple Conference Invitation Protocol", </title> <address> draft-ietf-mmusic-scip-00.txt, </address> <month> February </month> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: The current implementation of SIP in SDR is minimal, but performs well. SIP, however, allows for relays to provide user-location, firewall transition, etc. An alternate proposal, a Simple Conference Invitation Protocol (SCIP) <ref> [11] </ref>, had a partially complementary and partially overlapping functionality. It has been agreed that SCIP will be incorporated into a new version of SIP which will replace the individual activities. A draft of this new version of the SIP protocol was presented to the December IETF meeting [12].

Reference-contexts: It has been agreed that SCIP will be incorporated into a new version of SIP which will replace the individual activities. A draft of this new version of the SIP protocol was presented to the December IETF meeting <ref> [12] </ref>. We have gone far in the design of a secured version of SIP. This follows much the same lines as the private announcements, but now the Public Key used is that of the individual being invited to the conference.

Reference-contexts: The invitation will initially be via UDP; however, we also will provide an implementation based on the S-MIME message mechanism. One version of this has been implemented by GMD <ref> [13] </ref>; their specific implementation makes certain assumptions on the message system used, but a more general version will be developed over the next few months. The implementation of a secured SIP has been slightly delayed pending the completion of the integration of SCIP into SIP. 4.

Reference-contexts: queuing module will be needed and a modification of the Session Directory to allow the setup of these relays. 4.2 ISDN and Low Speed Support A major effort was undertaken between Hewlett-Packard and UCL to ensure that the ISDN access facilities, using a Primary Rate ISDN Router (with ASCEND hardware <ref> [14] </ref>), worked well with multiple B-channels. This has now been completed, and n x 64 Kbps channels can be supported. It is possible to run IP over multiple B-channels (between 1 and 30) into the primary rate devices at UCL and HP.
