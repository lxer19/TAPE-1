Title: Knowledge Considerations in Robotics and Distribution of Robotic Tasks  
Author: Ronen I. Brafman and Yoav Shoham 
Address: Stanford, CA. 94305  
Affiliation: Robotics Laboratory Stanford University  
Abstract: We develop a formal tool for representing and analyzing informational aspects of robotic tasks, based on the formal concept of `knowledge.' Specifically, we adopt the notion of knowledge-based protocols from distributed systems, and define the notions of knowledge complexity of a robotic task and knowledge capability of a robot. The resulting formalism naturally captures previous work in the areas of robot information management, but is sufficiently rigorous and natural to allow many extensions. In this paper we show one novel application the automated distribution of robotic tasks.

Reference-contexts: We recently showed a particular application of the formal notion of knowledge to the task of robot motion planning under uncertainty <ref> [ Brafman et al., 1994 ] </ref> ; here we propose a more ambitious application of the notion, namely as a basis for the general model of informational aspects of robots and robotic tasks. <p> Throughout this paper we assume a discrete model; specifically, we assume all state spaces to be discrete, and adopt a discrete model of time. We do so to simplify the exposition; the generalization to continuous domains is for the most part straightforward, though some subtleties do arise (cf. <ref> [ Brafman et al., 1994 ] </ref> for an application of logics of knowledge in motion planning in domains that are continuous in both time and space).

Reference-contexts: While still crude, our ability to classify different computational problems in terms of their complexity allows us to understand inherent difficulties in solving such problems. Some areas of robotics, such as motion planning, have benefited from advances in computational complexity (e.g., <ref> [ Canny, 1989 ] </ref> ). However, the area of robotics as a whole still lacks the analog of a Turing machine, a formal device that faithfully quantifies the difficulty of a robotic task or the capabilities of a robot.

Reference-contexts: In a longer version of this paper we discuss a natural notion of knowledge-based reduction that arises in our work, and tie it in with Donald's work. 5 Motivating our investigation of task distribution was the work of <ref> [ Donald et al., 1993 ] </ref> . This work examines distribution of manipulation tasks, starting from a centralized protocol. Their analysis of the information needed there shows that it pertains to the configuration of the manipulating robot w.r.t. the manipulated object.

Reference-contexts: In doing so we join a number of authors who have recently attempted to quantify the sensing difficulty of robotic tasks. [ Erdmann, 1994 ] attempts to assess the sensing requirements of robotics tasks in terms of what he calls abstract sensors. <ref> [ Donald, 1994 ] </ref> develops formal tools that allow him, among other things, to compare and classify the sensing capabilities of different concrete sensor systems such as a radial sensor and a beacon sensor. <p> One contribution of our work is to supply a formal language that captures these ideas, which (as we have shown) has natural extensions. Another influential idea is Donald's notion of information invariants <ref> [ Donald, 1994 ] </ref> , in which `reductions' play an important part. Roughly speaking, system A can be reduced to system B if we can use system B to obtain the same information that system A can obtain.

Reference-contexts: They are then able to obtain an asynchronous distributed protocol for such problems. 5 Updated versions of this work appear in URL http://robotics.stanford.edu/users/brafman/bio.html Finally, the use of prioritization in multi-robot environments appears in a different context in <ref> [ Erdmann and Lozano-Perez, 1987 ] </ref> . There, prioritization is used to produce motion plans for multiple moving objects. We believe that the marriage of knowledge representation and robotics is an extremely promising direction, which we intend to pursue.

Reference-contexts: Information, and more specifically sensing, are issues of central importance in robotics. The unreliability of sensors and the difficulty in reasoning about sensory information has lead some researchers to attempt to reduce the sensing requirements of tasks (e.g., <ref> [ Erdmann and Mason, 1993; Goldberg, 1993 ] </ref> . More generally, there has been increasing interest in understanding the inherent sensing requirements of a task. [ Erdmann, 1994 ] is one such effort which has had major influence on our work.

Reference-contexts: We propose a framework that faithfully models the information and lack thereof inherent in robotic tasks, such as is brought about by spatial distribution and imprecise sensors. In doing so we join a number of authors who have recently attempted to quantify the sensing difficulty of robotic tasks. <ref> [ Erdmann, 1994 ] </ref> attempts to assess the sensing requirements of robotics tasks in terms of what he calls abstract sensors. [ Donald, 1994 ] develops formal tools that allow him, among other things, to compare and classify the sensing capabilities of different concrete sensor systems such as a radial sensor <p> Given a progress measure we can prove that a protocol performs a task by showing that each transition the protocol takes produces a new state whose value is smaller than that of the previous state. <ref> [ Erdmann, 1994 ] </ref> ingeniously employs these ideas to the problem of generating minimal sensors. He uses an existing protocol to generate a progress measure that assigns to each state the maximal number of steps that the protocol might take to achieve the goal. <p> More generally, there has been increasing interest in understanding the inherent sensing requirements of a task. <ref> [ Erdmann, 1994 ] </ref> is one such effort which has had major influence on our work. Erdmann argues that sensors should be constructed to provide sufficient information to choose an action that makes progress. He uses progress measures, discussed earlier, to do so.

Reference-contexts: In particular, we believe that the formal notion of `knowledge' that has been proposed and studied in AI (e.g., [ Moore, 1985; Rosenschein, 1985 ] ) and distributed systems (e.g., <ref> [ Fagin et al., 1995 ] </ref> ) can serve as a basis for just such an abstraction. <p> We define a slight variant of an abstract notion of protocol knowledge-based protocols (KBP), due to <ref> [ Fagin et al., 1995 ] </ref> . 4 A KBP is a (possibly partial) function from the set of knowledge-states to the transitions of the given ARD. It can be viewed as a big case statement, each condition of which is a test on the knowledge of the ARU. <p> This last point is an important difference between our definition and that of <ref> [ Fagin et al., 1995 ] </ref> . Their KBPs contain a final ELSE clause, and are thus executable by any ARU.

Reference-contexts: The following definitions are by now standard in the formal AI and distributed computing communities (cf. [ Rosen-schein, 1985 ] and <ref> [ Halpern and Moses, 1990 ] </ref> ), but are probably new to many robotics researchers. While we include all definitions here, we will be able to provide full intuition for those new to the area only in a long version of this paper.

Reference-contexts: An ARD consists of a set of possible states and the possible transformations among them. Roughly, a state of the ARD corresponds to the notion of configuration in robotics <ref> [ Lozano-Perez, 1983 ] </ref> ; it encodes everything that is not internal to robots, such as the location of the robot and other objects. The information and computation capabilities of a robot are captured by an Abstract Robotic Unit (ARU).
