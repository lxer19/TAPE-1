Abstract: We define a new energy minimizing structure, the rubber sheet, that can be used to reliably detect and segment objects in noisy images. A rubber sheet is a flexibile bidimensional patch that evolves by trying to minimize a suitably defined energy function. The model doesn't impose restrictions on the type of energy functions that can be defined, but we give some considerations that can serve as a basis for useful ones. A practical implementation is described and used to solve object segmentation in intensity or disparity images, as well as an interesting tracking application.
