Abstract: 2 decays into a Z (fl) boson and the lightest neutralino. For large chargino masses the limits are improved with respect to the previous analyses at lower centre of mass energies. Exclusion regions at 95% C.L. of parameters of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) are determined. Within this framework the lightest chargino 1 limits exceeding the kinematical boundary of the ~ + 1 ~ 1 production are obtained due to the interpretation of the results from the direct ~ 0 2 ~ 0 1 search. Exclusion regions are also presented for neutralino masses, including an absolute lower limit on the lightest neutralino of 30.1 GeV at 95% C.L. with significant implications for its suitability as a dark matter candidate. The above limits are for the case of a large universal scalar mass (m 0 500 GeV). This note describes PRELIMINARY OPAL results and is intended primarily for members of the collaboration. These preliminary results supersede those presented at the LEPC 11/11/97.

Reference-contexts: This note describes a chargino and neutralino search using the new data and an analysis which is improved relative to the one presented in the previous publication <ref> [2] </ref> and in the previous Physics Notes [3]. Previous searches for charginos and neutralinos have been performed using data collected near the Z peak (LEP1), at p 172 GeV [2] by OPAL and the other LEP collaborations [6] [7]. <p> neutralino search using the new data and an analysis which is improved relative to the one presented in the previous publication <ref> [2] </ref> and in the previous Physics Notes [3]. Previous searches for charginos and neutralinos have been performed using data collected near the Z peak (LEP1), at p 172 GeV [2] by OPAL and the other LEP collaborations [6] [7]. Charginos, ~ j , are the mass eigenstates formed by the mixing of the fields of the fermionic partners of the W boson (winos) and those of the charged Higgs bosons (charged higgsinos). <p> The luminosity is measured using small-angle Bhabha scattering events detected in the silicon-tungsten calorimeter. A common preselection is applied for all data. The criteria are identical to those in Ref. <ref> [2] </ref> except that the visible mass cut has been reduced to 2 GeV for the low track multiplicity analysis and a veto against beam wall events, employing the mean of the impact parameters (with respect to the beam spot position) of the reconstructed charged tracks, is used for the high track <p> The criteria of the isolated lepton selection (including isolated tau selection) are similar to that described in Ref. <ref> [2] </ref> 4 The percentage of expected ~ + 1 ~ 1 events in each category is given in Table 1. <p> These systematic errors are considered to be independent and are added in quadrature (7-12%). The systematic errors in luminosity, Monte Carlo statistics and modelling of the cut variables in Monte Carlo are evaluated as in the previous Physics Note [3]. Other systematic errors are taken from the previous publication <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> The modelling of the cut variables in Monte Carlo (both signal and background processes) have been reevaluated for essential variables. Most of the variables used in this analysis were used in the previous analysis. Estimated values of other systematic errors have been taken from the previous publication <ref> [2] </ref>. The rate of events in which the measured energy in the SW, FD or GC calorimeters, due to noise and beam related background, exceeded the thresholds in the preselection is 4.5% as estimated from random beam crossing events.

Reference-contexts: Fermionic partners of the fl, the Z boson, and the neutral Higgs bosons mix to form mass eigenstates called neutralinos, ~ 0 i . In each case, the index j or i is ordered by increasing mass. R-parity <ref> [8] </ref> conservation is assumed; therefore, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable. The LSP is usually considered to be the lightest neutralino, ~ 0 1 , although it could be the scalar neutrino, ~-, if it is sufficiently light. The LSP is undetected due to its weakly interacting nature.

In the MSSM analyses reported here all possible cascade decay processes <ref> [26, 28] </ref> are 1 The decay would be via a Z fl , a neutral SUSY Higgs boson (h 0 or A 0 ), sneutrino, slepton, or squark. The decay via Z fl is the dominant mode in most of the parameter space. 1 taken into account. <p> ~ 0 2 =E beam = p ~ 0 1 =E beam for ~ 0 2 ~ 0 1 production. 16 From the input parameters M 2 , , tan fi, m 0 and A (the trilinear coupling), masses, produc-tion cross-sections and branching fractions are calculated according to the CMSSM <ref> [24, 25, 26, 28] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: 1 fl leading to single photon topologies from ~ 0 2 ~ 0 1 production and acoplanar photons with missing energy topolo gies from ~ 0 2 ~ 0 2 are taken into account using the 95% CL cross-section upper limits on these topologies from the OPAL results of Ref. <ref> [29] </ref>. The following regions of the CMSSM parameters are scanned: 0 M 2 2000 GeV, jj 500 GeV, and A = M 2 ; m 0 and 0. The typical scan step is 0.2 GeV.
