Abstract: The function of an unknown biological sequence can often be accurately inferred by identifying sequences homologous to the original sequence. Given a query set of known homologs, there exist at least three general classes of techniques for finding additional homologs: pairwise sequence comparisons, motif analysis, and hidden Markov modeling. Pairwise sequence comparisons are typically employed when only a single query sequence is known. Hidden Markov models (HMMs), on the other hand, are usually trained with sets of more than 100 sequences. Motif-based methods fall in between these two extremes.

Reference-contexts: The most widely used means of inferring homology involves performing a pairwise comparisons between a single query sequence and a sequence in a protein database. Dynamic programming algorithms, such as the Smith-Waterman algorithm, or related heuristic algorithms, such as BLAST <ref> [2, 3] </ref> and FASTA [30], can be used to assign to each sequence in a database a score indicating the likelihood that this sequence is homologous to the query sequence. Because homology inferences are based upon statistical measures, they become increasingly uncertain when the evidence for homology is weak. <p> This resulted in 73 query sets of size 2, 57 sets of size 4, 35 of size 8, 16 of size 16 and 3 query sets of size 32. Pairwise sequence comparison For homology detection using pairwise comparisons, gapped BLAST version 2.0 was used <ref> [2] </ref>. BLAST is a heuristic approximation of a dynamic programming optimization of maximal segment pair scores. The program was run with its default parameters, including the filtering of low-complexity regions and the use of the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix.

Each sequence in the database is compared with each sequence in the query set and the resulting scores are combined into an overall score for that sequence. <p> Iterating this bootstrap procedure should provide even better homology information than the single pass reported here. Iterative applications of BLAST have been suggested by Koonin and Tatusov [22] and implemented in Probe [27] and PSI-BLAST <ref> [3] </ref>. However, Probe and PSI-BLAST search the database using position-specific scoring matrix representations. In order to test the usefulness of these matrix representations, it would be interesting to compare the performance of PSI-BLAST with that of an iterative search that employs the average BLAST score.

Reference-contexts: This heuristic excludes motifs that are specific to subfamilies of the given query set. For eight-sequence queries, the heuristic selected an average of 5.2 motifs. Homology detection was performed using MAST <ref> [6] </ref>. For each sequence in the database, MAST computes a p-value for each given motif and combines these values assuming that motif occurrences are statistically independent. The resulting sequence-level E-value scores were used to rank the sequences in the database.

Attempts to model families of related proteins are necessarily biased because the set of known protein sequences does not uniformly sample from the space of existing family members.

These statistical models have a strong theoretical basis in probability and are supported by efficient algorithms for training, database searching, 1 and multiple sequence alignment. The model parameters are learned via expectation-maximization, and the homology detection algorithm is a form of dynamic programming.

Reference-contexts: One drawback to modeling proteins using HMMs is that they contain many free parameters and therefore require a large amount of training data. A typical, 200-state HMM may contain on the order of 5000 trainable parameters. The use of empirically derived Dirichlet mixture priors <ref> [12] </ref> can partially offset the need for larger training sets. The size of the model may be greatly reduced by focusing only upon regions that are highly conserved across family members. Usually these regions, called motifs, have been conserved by evolution for important structural or functional reasons.

Reference-contexts: The twilight zone of sequence similarity sets the boundary of confidence levels for detecting evolutionary relatedness of proteins [14]. For most pairwise alignment programs, the twilight zone falls between 20-25% sequence identity <ref> [13] </ref>. In order to push back the twilight zone and thereby discover more remote homologs, additional information is needed. Family-based methods of homology detection leverage the information contained in a set of proteins that are known to be homologous.

Reference-contexts: Accordingly, all the experiments reported here employ a simple, binary weighting scheme based upon BLAST similarity scores <ref> [26] </ref>. This approach is simple, since the highly similar sequences can be removed at once before any analysis is performed, and leads to faster training, since the sizes of the weighted training sets are reduced. For these experiments, a BLAST similarity threshold of 200 was used.
