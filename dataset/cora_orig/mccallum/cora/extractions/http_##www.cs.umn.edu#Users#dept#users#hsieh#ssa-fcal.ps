Abstract: Two emerging serial storage interfaces, Serial Storage Architecture (SSA) and Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL) are studied in this paper. The advantages of these two emerging standards include (1) simple cabling system (serial instead of parallel), (2) higher bandwidth, (3) capable of connecting a large number (more than one hundred) of disks, (4) fault tolerance and (5) fair access of the channel. We intend to find the performance limitations and characteristics of these two interfaces. We have investigated the performance of both SSA and FC-AL in terms of latency, overhead and aggregate throughput under three types of traffic load: light, heavy and based on a trace log from a database application. We have also studied the fairness algorithms of SSA and FC-AL. The results presented in this paper not only enhance our knowledge of SSA and FC-AL, but can also be used to effectively utilize the two technologies for potential applications.

Reference-contexts: The experiment result shows the impact of SCSI's unfair bus arbitration, especially when the SCSI is heavily loaded. Several serial storage interfaces with higher data transfer rates were developed as alternatives which may solve some of the SCSI's problems discussed before. These interfaces include Serial Storage Architecture (SSA) <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL) [4], IEEE P1394 serial bus [14], and others. A serial interface uses compact connectors and serial links to simplify cabling schemes and reduce the cost. <p> We emphasize features that can affect the performance. We also present interface specifications in order to explain their behaviors. This overview is not a comprehensive introduction to both technologies. Interested readers should refer to related standards and draft standards <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 6] </ref>. <p> On the other hand, the communications between the initiator and all other disks (from bN=2c+1 to N) go through the right part of the loop. (See Figure 9.) In the SSA simulation model, the interleaving of special characters and the application frames is simulated as specified in the standard draft <ref> [1] </ref>. For simplicity, RR and ACK characters are always transmitted in two consecutive character slots. We assume the initiator is capable of transmitting frames to both output ports and receiving frames from both input ports simultaneously.

Reference-contexts: This is due to its arbitration protocol and per-node delay. To reduce the arbitration overhead, an extended version of FC-AL has been proposed in the standard committee <ref> [5] </ref>. The extension provides an option of slotted loop protocol. With the slotted loop protocol, an FC-AL node which won the arbitration can be designated as the master L Port. The master L Port can regulate the traffic by sending out slots circulating the loop.

Reference-contexts: FC-AL is a loop architecture which can have any combination of hosts and storage devices up to a total of 127. With 100 MBytes/sec bandwidth, the loop structure enables the rapid exchange of data between devices. As an enhancement to the Fibre Channel standard <ref> [6] </ref>, FC-AL is capable of using either copper cables for low-cost connections or optical cables for longer distance connections (up to 10 km with single-mode fiber optics). FC-AL can be used together with a Fibre Channel switch to form a distributed storage system. <p> We emphasize features that can affect the performance. We also present interface specifications in order to explain their behaviors. This overview is not a comprehensive introduction to both technologies. Interested readers should refer to related standards and draft standards <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 6] </ref>. <p> During the transmission of frames, the sender restrains itself from transmitting more frames than the receiver can accommodate. Functional layers FC-0 to FC-2 are defined in Fiber Channel - Physical and Signaling Interface (FC-PH) <ref> [6] </ref>. * FC-3, Common Services, is concerned with functions that span multiple N ports (node ports), including Striping (uses multiple N ports in parallel for their aggregate bandwidth), Hunt groups (allows more than one Ports to respond to the same alias address for higher efficiency), and Multi-cast (delivers information to multiple <p> In Figure 8, we differentiate the states with white boxes and shaded boxes. An L port in 16 those states with shaded boxes can transmit and receive FC-2 data and control frames as specified in ANSI X3.230 FC-PH <ref> [6] </ref>. Those states with white boxes are used by L Ports for arbitration and monitoring activities on the loop. Fairness Algorithm Like other prioritized protocols, FC-AL's arbitration scheme could lead to situations where an L Port with a low priority can not gain access of the loop.
