Title: An (D log(N=D)) Lower Bound for Broadcast in Radio Networks  
Author: Eyal Kushilevitz Yishay Mansour 
Date: March 17, 1996  
Abstract: We show that for any randomized broadcast protocol for radio networks, there exists a network in which the expected time to broadcast a message is (D log(N=D)), where D is the diameter of the network and N is the number of nodes. This implies a tight lower bound of (D log N) for any D N 1" , where " &gt; 0 is any constant.

Reference-contexts: In contrast they show that for any deterministic broadcast algorithm there are networks of constant diameter on which the algorithm needs (N ) time slots. Alon et al. <ref> [ABLP91] </ref> made the first step towards proving the optimality of the upper bound of [BGI92]. Their result can be viewed as a graph-theoretic result; they show that there exist networks of diameter D = 3 on which any schedule needs at least (log 2 N ) time slots. <p> In case that D N 1" , the above proof shows a lower bound of (D log N ). Combining our result with the results of Alon et al. <ref> [ABLP91] </ref> and Bar-Yehuda et al. [BGI92] we have the following tight result. 13 Corollary 8 For any non-uniform broadcast protocol, for every number of processors N and every diameter D, there exists a network in which the time to complete a broadcast is (log 2 N + D log (N=D)). <p> Furthermore, there is a (uniform) protocol that requires only O (log 2 N + D log N ) expected time (which is tight for D N 1" ). Note that unlike <ref> [ABLP91] </ref> we show that for any protocol there exists a network for which the lower bound holds, while they prove that there exists a network on which any protocol requires the lower bound. 6 Acknowledgments We wish to thank Oded Goldreich for his very useful comments.

An important issue in the study of radio networks is whether collisions can be detected; namely, whether a listener can distinguish between the case that none of its neighbors transmit and the case that two or more of them transmit.

Reference-contexts: In this work we assume that none of the processors have initially any topological information, except for the size of the network and its diameter. 1 See <ref> [Tan81, Gal85, BGI92, BGI91] </ref> for a discussion on this model and related models. We study broadcast protocols; those protocols are initiated by a single processor (the originator) that has a message M it wishes to propagate to all the other processors in the network. <p> In many of the radio networks applications (e.g. cellular phones) broadcast is a central primitive which is frequently used, for example to perform a network-wide search for a user. Bar-Yehuda et al. <ref> [BGI92] </ref> present a randomized broadcast algorithm, that runs in expected O (D log N + log 2 N ) time slots, where N is the number of processors in the network and D is its diameter. <p> In contrast they show that for any deterministic broadcast algorithm there are networks of constant diameter on which the algorithm needs (N ) time slots. Alon et al. [ABLP91] made the first step towards proving the optimality of the upper bound of <ref> [BGI92] </ref>. Their result can be viewed as a graph-theoretic result; they show that there exist networks of diameter D = 3 on which any schedule needs at least (log 2 N ) time slots. <p> This lower bound shows that there are networks on which broadcast requires this many time-slots, and it matches the known upper bounds <ref> [BGI92, CW87] </ref>, in the case of constant-diameter networks. In this work we complete the picture by proving an (D log (N=D)) lower bound. <p> For D N 1" this gives an (D log N ) lower bound. Hence, it proves the tightness of the upper bound of <ref> [BGI92] </ref> for all N and D N 1" . Moreover, the lower bound holds even if each of the N processors is allowed to use a different program (e.g. the processors can use their IDs). <p> There is another common model in which it is assumed that the two cases are distinguishable (say, if no neighbor transmits the listener hears silence while if two or more neighbors transmit the listener hears noise). A discussion justifying both models can be found in <ref> [Gal85, BGI92] </ref>. Willard [Wil86] studies a broadcast problem, in a single multi-access channel under this second model (i.e., when collision-detection is available). He shows matching upper and lower bounds of fi (log log n) expected time slots 2 in this model. <p> In particular, he requires independence between the decision whether to transmit in a certain time slot and the decisions made in previous time slots. In our case such a restriction is unacceptable as the upper bound of <ref> [BGI92] </ref> has such dependencies. Also he does not handle the case where each processor may use different program. 3 2 Preliminaries A radio network is described by an undirected graph G (V; E) 3 , where N = jV j and D is the diameter of the graph. <p> Claim 5 Let Q be as above, and let Q 0 = fQ 0 1 ; : : : ; Q 0 2 ` g be a set of 2 ` processors. Each processor Q 0 j run the program of Q j at the odd steps and the <ref> [BGI92] </ref> program at the even steps (note that the [BGI92] program is also a uniform protocol, and therefore so is the program run by the processors Q 0 ). <p> Each processor Q 0 j run the program of Q j at the odd steps and the <ref> [BGI92] </ref> program at the even steps (note that the [BGI92] program is also a uniform protocol, and therefore so is the program run by the processors Q 0 ). Let fi ` be the probability that 8j 1 6= j 2 : c (Q j 1 ) 6= c (Q j 2 ). <p> Then, E [T ` ] 2fi ` E [T In the above claim we mixed the given (unknown) protocol with the <ref> [BGI92] </ref> protocol. This is because we have no guarantee about the running time of the simulation, in case that some Q j 's choose to simulate the same P i . <p> In the case that the choices of c (Q j ) are not unique we cannot use the properties of the original protocol. However, we can use the fact that the <ref> [BGI92] </ref> protocol has expected time until first success of at most 4 log n. Therefore, E [T ` jnot unique] 8 log n which completes the proof of the claim. * The next claim says that with "high probability" the choices c (Q j ) are unique. <p> This implies a similar lower bound for the case where for the worst case running time, when a small probability of error is allowed (which is the scenario in which the upper bound of <ref> [BGI92] </ref> is described). Given an algorithm, and the values N and D we construct a network as follows. Let n = N=D, and assume for simplicity that n is a power of 2. We construct a complete layered network of D + 2 layers. <p> In case that D N 1" , the above proof shows a lower bound of (D log N ). Combining our result with the results of Alon et al. [ABLP91] and Bar-Yehuda et al. <ref> [BGI92] </ref> we have the following tight result. 13 Corollary 8 For any non-uniform broadcast protocol, for every number of processors N and every diameter D, there exists a network in which the time to complete a broadcast is (log 2 N + D log (N=D)).
