Title: Experimenting Systems Analysis Teaching Using a Comparative Approach A position paper  
Author: Avigdor Gal 
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Toronto Opher Etzion Information Systems Engineering Department Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management Technion Israel Institute of Technology  
Abstract: There are many methods for modeling information systems, none of which has a definite advantage over the others. Thus, it is necessary to develop a decision process for existing modeling methods to determine the most appropriate set of modeling tools for a specific application. This position paper outlines such a decision process, based on the experience accumulated over the years of teaching courses in analysis and design of information systems in the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology. The decision procedure is carried out by using a set of evaluation criteria, that are applied to a specific application.

Reference-contexts: The DFD method, introduced by Yourdon and DeMarco [2] is the representative of this class of methodologies. * The structural object-oriented approach. Various models of this family have been taught, including Coad and Yourdon's method <ref> [1] </ref>, and the model developed by Embley et al. [4]. * The behavioral control-oriented approach. The model taught in this category is the Statechart model [7]. 3 3 The evaluation process The evaluation process is based on the simple process of Application characterizations ! Evaluation ! Tool (set of tools). <p> The use of several levels of description is required whenever there is a big number of analyzed elements. While DFD has a natural mechanism of unfolding a process, OOA is basically a single layer method. In <ref> [1] </ref>, for example, there is only a single level above the objects level. complexity: This criterion evaluates the complexity of activities and objects in the system. High complexity of objects suggests the use of OOA, while high complexity of activities advocates the use of DFD.

Reference-contexts: In the methodology area, the students are faced with different system analysis paradigms to develop critical evaluation of these tools. During the systems analysis course, the following three main approaches are being introduced. * The functional data-flow oriented approach. The DFD method, introduced by Yourdon and DeMarco <ref> [2] </ref> is the representative of this class of methodologies. * The structural object-oriented approach. Various models of this family have been taught, including Coad and Yourdon's method [1], and the model developed by Embley et al. [4]. * The behavioral control-oriented approach.

Reference-contexts: The critical evaluation method refers to this list as well, and it will probably evolve in the future. The evaluation model resulted in several new modeling tools that have been developed in the Technion, including the OPA method <ref> [3] </ref> and the CODES model [6]. OPA combines the DFD and the OOA approaches to enable a better representation of interaction. CODES supports a combination of a functional approach with a behavioral approach to support scheduling constraints and causality.

Reference-contexts: This criterion enables the cost-effectiveness evaluation of introducing new tools. As an example of using this evaluation process, we consider the analysis of the cooperation of a set of existing systems in a workflow <ref> [5] </ref> required as a first step towards an implementation. Our conclusions are that a workflow system contains inter-relationships among system elements, and therefore there is a need to provide scheduling constraints and causality.
