Abstract: The main goal of this study was to survey current applications of GPS to distributed systems and networks. While GPS is appearing in the computer magazines very often and while many computer companies have announced GPS related efforts, most such efforts are in providing navigational guidance to drivers. Digitized city maps along with a GPS sensor on a mobile computer provide directions to drivers. A number of consortiums have been formed by companies such as IBM, Apple, Toshiba, Sony, and others. We have identified twenty new applications of GPS for distributed computing and networking. These applications include circuit switching using synchronized clocks, synchronous slotted systems, clock synchronization in distributed systems, database synchronization, connectionless real-time communication, one-way delay, delay based routing, time to live, resource location, location adaptive protocols, home vs office vs car, electronic fence, hand-offs in wireless networks, prescheduled handoffs based on velocity and direction, adaptive transmission power control algorithms, directional antennas, temporary cell partitioning for congestion avoidance, peer-to-peer routing with limited range receivers, email delivery based on geographic location, distributed robot control and navigation, and equipment location marking for maintenance crew. There two main obstacles to applications of GPS. First is that GPS antennas must point to open sky. They cannot be used directly inside a building. Unless this is avoided by new antenna designs or by rebroadcasting GPS data inside a building, the use of GPS techniques is limited to improving the performance of distributed systems rather than proper operation. This is similar to cache memories in computer systems. Systems can operate without cache but perform better with cache. The second obstacle is the psudo-random noise introduced 1 We would like to thank 3COM Corporation for partially sponsoring this project.

Reference-contexts: Stratum 1 (ST-1) is the highest quality clock for a network. Building Integrated Timing Supply (BITS) is the Bellcore's stand-alone clock-system specification for a timing supply. BITS allows using LORAN/Rubidium ST1 clock systems. In near future, they plan to use GPS frequency reference at each SONET site <ref> [41] </ref>. To provide a high level of performance, AT&T has developed a primary reference clock (PRC) system using the timing signals from GPS. In PRCs, GPS receivers provide long term timing accuracy and rubidium oscillators provide short-term stability [10].
