Title: Integration Methods for Galerkin Radiosity Couplings  
Author: Reid Gershbein 
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science, Princeton University  
Abstract: Computing energy transfer between objects is the most expensive operation in radiosity systems. This energy transfer operation, known as the irradiance operator, is an integral that, in general, must be calculated numerically. We perform a study of numerical integration techniques to increase the speed of this computation without severely compromising fidelity. A theoretical discussion of numerical integration is presented followed by details of the studied methods. The results of our study give us insight into greatly reducing the cost of the irradiance operator while maintaining accuracy. An adaptive method for choosing Gauss quadrature rules is presented, and our performance analysis of the new adaptive algorithm shows that it can be up to 10 times faster than previous methods.

For non-constant bases, the methods of choice have been Gauss quadrature product rules, except when there are singularities in the kernel [20, 19, 5, 13, 11]. In a hierarchical Galerkin radiosity system, a subdivision strategy is invoked so that each K ij has the same amount of error.

We have tried the adaptive algorithm in a range of scenes with linear, quadratic, and cubic multiwavelets. These tests were done with a quadtree subdivision. The subdivision oracle was BF refinement <ref> [6] </ref> and visibility was determined by Teller and Hanra-han's visibility classification [18]. We find that the speedup is half the theoretical best-case maximum of 4, 9, and 16 times for linear, quadratic, and cubic bases, respectively. This theoretical maximum occurs when you have only constant sources.

Reference-contexts: We are looking for the cheapest way of evaluating these integrals. Based on this, Gauss integration rules are the best. An N point Gauss rule will exactly integrate polynomials of up to degree 2N 1. As stated in <ref> [16] </ref>, Gauss quadrature rules compared to methods such as Newton-Cotes and extrapolation yield the most accurate results for the same amount of computation.

Reference-contexts: A detailed account of such rules can be found in <ref> [17] </ref> and we now present an abridged discussion of the topic. A cubature rule in the form (3) has degree d if it is exact for all polynomials in x 1 ; : : : ; x m whose exponents sum to d. <p> These methods typically have less error than methods that have some negative weights and/or have points outside the integration domain <ref> [17] </ref>. The numerical integration methods we have studied can be broken down into three main categories: Gauss product rules, non-product Rules, and Monte Carlo methods. <p> For a given basis, we test a number of these rules that are of the same degree as the F ullGauss rule and have fewer function evaluations. The non-products methods tested are presented by Stroud <ref> [17] </ref> and our experiments used linear and quadratic bases. In the linear case, F ullGauss is degree 3 and uses 16 function evaluations (N = 2, 2 4 ).
