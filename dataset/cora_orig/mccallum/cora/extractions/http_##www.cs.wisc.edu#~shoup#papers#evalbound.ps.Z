Title: Lower Bounds for Polynomial Evaluation and Interpolation Problems  
Author: Victor Shoup Roman Smolensky 
Keyword: n log n  
Abstract: We show that there is a set of points p 1 ; p 2 ; : : :; p n such that any arithmetic circuit of depth d for polynomial evaluation (or interpolation) at these points has size Moreover, for circuits of sub-logarithmic depth, we obtain a lower bound of (dn 1+1=d ) on its size.

Reference-contexts: This problem is the same as computing the linear transformation on C n defined by the Vandermonde matrix V = (p j1 Multi-point evaluation is of central importance in algebraic computation, and has been well-studied (see, e.g., <ref> [AHU74] </ref> or [Bmu75]). The best arithmetic circuits for this problem are of size O (n (log n) 2 ) and depth O ((log n) 2 ). When the points are the n-th roots of unity, then this problem is called the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).

Reference-contexts: There exists an absolute constant C such that ` &gt; C log (2 + d= log n) Moreover, if d log n= log 3, then ` &gt; Cdn 1+1=d : We remark that the idea of writing V T = HV 1 comes from the paper <ref> [CKY89] </ref>, which uses this relation to prove an upper bound for computing the linear transformation defined by the matrix V T . 5 Open Problems Question 1.

Reference-contexts: It was conjectured by Valiant that all the Vandermonde matrices have high rigidity, but this conjecture remains unproven. Moreover, it is not known if any Vandermonde matrix has high 3 rigidity. Some estimations of rigidity for specific matrices were made by Razborov [Raz] and Friedman <ref> [Fri93] </ref>. However all the known bounds on the rigidity of specific matrices are still not high enough to imply complexity bounds.

Reference-contexts: We also point out that even though we do not prove any rigidity conditions, the lower bounds we obtain are similar to what one would obtain if these matrices could be shown to be highly rigid. Other restrictions on circuits besides depth are possible. For example, Morgenstern <ref> [Mor73] </ref> showed that if the constants used in the linear circuit have absolute value at most one, then a circuit that computes the DFT has size (n log n). In fact, the best known circuits for this problem satisfy this property.

Reference-contexts: A linear circuit is an arithmetic circuit that that uses only multiplication by constants and addition. At the expense of increasing the size and depth by constant factors, we can replace an arbitrary arithmetic circuit for computing a set of linear forms by a linear circuit <ref> [St73b] </ref>. We allow unbounded fan-in of addition gates, so that linear circuits of sub-logarithmic depth are possible. In this paper we consider circuits of small depth. <p> known that for infinite K, if an arithmetic circuit P computes a linear transformation, then there is a linear circuit P 0 that computes the same function as P , and the size and depth of P 0 are within a constant factor of the size and depth of P <ref> [St73b] </ref>. 3 Lower Bounds for Polynomial Evaluation The motivation for our proof comes from the theory of algebraic dimension, which measures the amount of algebraic independence of a set x 1 ; : : : ; x r of elements in some algebra over a field in terms of the function

Reference-contexts: We also prove analogous results for the inverse problem of polynomial interpolation, i.e., computing the linear transformation on C n defined by the matrix V 1 . Related work Valiant <ref> [Val77] </ref> also considered circuits of small depth for computing linear transformations. Valiant proved that if the matrix of a linear transformation is "rigid" then a linear circuit of small depth requires superlinear size in order to compute the transformation.
