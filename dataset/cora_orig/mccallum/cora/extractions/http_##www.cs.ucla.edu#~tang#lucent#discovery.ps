Reference-contexts: As mentioned earlier, the visualization issue is essentially ignored for this version, although it would not be difficult to pipe Netmaps results into some external visualization module. 3.2. Implementation Netmap was implemented using C++ on a Solaris 2.5.1 platform. It uses CMUs SNMP API library <ref> [CMU98] </ref> to facilitate SNMP access.

Reference-contexts: We can therefore only speculate on the approaches used by these tools. Note, too, that HP OpenView was the only commercial package to which we had access for evaluation. 4.2.1. OpenView OpenView <ref> [HP98] </ref> is Hewlett-Packards complete platform and solutions package that covers a wide range of network and system management tasks. One of the modules, the Network Node Manager, specifically covers network discovery.

Reference-contexts: One reason is that some of the tools do not support a Solaris platform, but mainly it was due to lack of access to the products. For further details, see [ON98], <ref> [O98] </ref>, and [SW98], among others. 5.

Reference-contexts: However, the downside, similar to Scotty, is the reliance on nonstandard heuristics, not to mention the amount of work required to properly implement and coordinate the multitude of protocols. 4.1.3. Netdig Netdig <ref> [R91] </ref> is a very simple commandline program that uses SNMP to query for routing information to discover a network. Unfortunately, since it only queries routing information, it can only discover routers connected to the network, and thus it does not provide a very complete picture.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, as network technology develops, networks become faster and better able to handle the additional load of our network probes. Thus, we have little qualms in using active probing. Another forward-looking design decision was to use only ICMP <ref> [RFC792] </ref> and SNMPv1 [RFC1157] for our system information. The idea of a lightweight, proprietary protocol was discussed, but it was rejected as being too difficult to deploy widely.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we count on the assumed widespread acceptance of SNMP in all network hardware. The use of other protocols, such as DNS and ARP, were rejected as unnecessary given our assumptions about SNMP. Only standard MIB-II <ref> [RFC1213] </ref> entries (mandatory elements) for SNMP were accessed to ensure maximum compatibility. Remote probing is made possible by the above two decisions. Netmap can discover any network to which it has IP connectivity due to its non-reliance on protocols such as ARP.

Reference-contexts: Three free tools and an equally-low number of commercial tools were studied while researching this problem. These tools are described below. 4.1. Free Discovery Tools Presumably because the task is so difficult, only three free discovery tools were found: Scotty, Fremont, and Netdig. 4.1.1. Scotty Scotty <ref> [S98] </ref> is actually an entire package of network management software built upon a custom Tcl-based API. The network discovery tool itself is called tkined and is described in [SL93]. tkined uses ICMP (ping, traceroute, netmask request) and DNS heuristics to discover a network.

Reference-contexts: In addition, due to its size, it uses a significant number of resources, and examining its impact on the networks that it is probing would be an interesting subject of future research. 4.2.2. NetView NetView <ref> [TS98] </ref> is a part of the Tivoli Enterprise Software package, Tivolis competitor to HPs OpenView. Like the Network Node Manager, NetView allows IP discovery, visualization, automatic updates, event notification, and so on. It too seems to use SNMP for gathering its system information. 4.2.3.

Reference-contexts: For example, tkined relies on the fact that many system administrators name different interfaces of a multi-homed machine with the same name prefix (e.g., demimonde-144 and demimonde-163). Tang 6 4.1.2. Fremont Fremont <ref> [WCS93] </ref> is a network discovery tool that takes a slightly different approach to discovery than Scotty.
