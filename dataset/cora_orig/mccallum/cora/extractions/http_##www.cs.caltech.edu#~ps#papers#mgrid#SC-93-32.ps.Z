Reference-contexts: These polynomials are orthogonal and therefore hierarchical in p. result 1. We conclude that there are shape functions generating local matrices with condition number one. Some are hierarchical in p, too. A remark concerning hierarchy in h. Besides the so-called hierarchical basis algorithms <ref> [Ban88, DLY89, Yse86, CZZ84, ZGK83] </ref>, shape functions being hierarchal in h are not very convenient. Some of these shape functions have a global support. They generate dense global matrices A which are expensive to compute with. Another problem is the number of hierarchical 8 levels in an h-p-version.

Reference-contexts: In the one-dimensional case there are shape functions with C independant from p, namely the integrated Legendre polynomials (chapter 3.3). Next we can conclude from sharp estimates in <ref> [BCMP91] </ref>, that there are shape functions in two dimensions with global condition number (A) C (a; fl)h 2 (1 + log 2 p) for uniform h. <p> The required functions are split into point-, edge- and internal shape functions in the usual way and the edge-functions have to be discrete harmonic with respect to the operator a. For dimensions higher than two (d &gt; 2) an analogous construction delivers rapidly growing condition numbers in p <ref> [BCMP91] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: There is no need for other linear shape functions and in this sense they are optimal. Working with higher polynomial degrees the choice should depend on the version of finite elements. Interpolatory and orthogonal polynomials are commonly used in this case. In spite of different suggestions <ref> [MP72, Nic72, Pea76, SB91, ZT89, BGP89, DORH89] </ref>, there is no canonical set of polynomials concerning optimal condition number and simplicity of usage. There is no systematic analysis about shape functions on any simplex either (except for the interval). <p> The original shape functions on the triangle are not p-hierarchical for the step from degree 3 to 4. We modified the basis to be hierarchical, loosing symmetry. 3.2 Condition Numbers We now compare the resulting local condition numbers like in <ref> [BGP89] </ref>. We choose the Laplace operator u (i.e. a 0 0 and a ik I) and vary the geometry of the elements. Equivalently we could have changed the differential operator keeping the element fixed.

Besides the so-called hierarchical basis algorithms <ref> [Ban88, DLY89, Yse86, CZZ84, ZGK83] </ref>, shape functions being hierarchal in h are not very convenient. Some of these shape functions have a global support. They generate dense global matrices A which are expensive to compute with. Another problem is the number of hierarchical 8 levels in an h-p-version.

Reference-contexts: These polynomials are orthogonal and therefore hierarchical in p. result 1. We conclude that there are shape functions generating local matrices with condition number one.

Reference-contexts: There is no need for other linear shape functions and in this sense they are optimal. Working with higher polynomial degrees the choice should depend on the version of finite elements. Interpolatory and orthogonal polynomials are commonly used in this case. In spite of different suggestions <ref> [MP72, Nic72, Pea76, SB91, ZT89, BGP89, DORH89] </ref>, there is no canonical set of polynomials concerning optimal condition number and simplicity of usage. There is no systematic analysis about shape functions on any simplex either (except for the interval). <p> But for the simplex one has to give up some other nice charcteristics of the Legendre polynomials and a more complicated approach <ref> [Pea76, SB91, ZT89] </ref> has to be used. For a pure h-version one can keep Lagrange interpolation [MP72, Nic72]. In the following we analyze the operations for solving a problem by an adaptive (multilevel) finite element code with respect to the operations on the shape functions. <p> Legendre [SB91] fi 2-D only - fi mod. monomials [Pea76] fi 2-D only - fi p-hierarch. mod. <ref> [ZT89] </ref> fi 2-D only fl -fl fi fl original fl [ZT89] fi fi fi - Lagrange [MP72, Nic72] fi fi fi - Bernstein [Far90] fi fi fi - symm. hierarch. chapter (2) fi fi fi fi The reader should not be surprised that we can separate two classes of shape functions: <p> Legendre [SB91] fi 2-D only - fi mod. monomials [Pea76] fi 2-D only - fi p-hierarch. mod. <ref> [ZT89] </ref> fi 2-D only fl -fl fi fl original fl [ZT89] fi fi fi - Lagrange [MP72, Nic72] fi fi fi - Bernstein [Far90] fi fi fi - symm. hierarch. chapter (2) fi fi fi fi The reader should not be surprised that we can separate two classes of shape functions: The p-hierarchical and the symmetrical ones. <p> The only 25 exception are the new symmetric hierarchical polynomials.

The original shape functions on the triangle are not p-hierarchical for the step from degree 3 to 4. We modified the basis to be hierarchical, loosing symmetry. 3.2 Condition Numbers We now compare the resulting local condition numbers like in [BGP89]. <p> We may draw conclusions from this 1-D case for edge based shape functions in higher dimensions.
