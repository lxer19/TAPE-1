Abstract: This paper reports a computational model of Boole's discovery of Logic as a part of Mathematics. George Boole (1815-1864) found that the symbols of Logic behaved as algebraic symbols, and he then rebuilt the whole contemporary theory of Logic by the use of methods such as the solution of algebraic equations. Study of the different historical factors that influenced this achievement has served as background for our two main contributions: a computational representation of Boole's Logic before it was mathematized; and a production system, BOOLE2, that rediscovers Logic as a science that behaves exactly as a branch of Mathematics, and that thus validates to some extent the historical explanation. The system's discovery methods are found to be general enough to handle three other cases: two versions of a Geometry due to a contemporary of Boole, and a small subset of the Differential Calculus.

Further, many of its heuristics stem from theory, i.e., from the precise symbolic in which G.

Reference-contexts: is not by mere chance that he entitled his main logical treatise "The Laws of Thought", and that in his first public appearance, in an 1835 lecture on Newton, well before he met Gregory, he stated that his aim was to deal with Newton's mind rather than with Newton's biography <ref> [2, p.1] </ref>. * Fourth, in terms of AI, we have found another example of an AI system that resembles how humans work in representing and solving problems.

Reference-contexts: Boole's interest in Logic dated from much earlier: "... I was induced by the interest which it (the controversy) inspired, to resume the almost forgotten thread of former inquires" <ref> [3, p.1] </ref>. He renewed his interest in Logic because of the controversy between the philosopher William Hamilton and the mathematician Augustus De Morgan. However, there is no evidence that Gregory had been interested in Logic. <p> However, there is no evidence that Gregory had been interested in Logic. Boole's exposition of the first principles of Logic at the start of his book "The Mathematical Analysis of Logic" <ref> [3] </ref> reveals his awareness of the interdependence between Logic and Language: That which renders Logic possible, is the existence in our minds of general notions,-our ability to conceive of a class, and to designate its individual 6 members by a common name. <p> The theory of Logic is thus intimately connec-ted with that of Language. A successful attempt to express logical propositions by symbols, the laws of whose combinations should be founded upon the laws of the mental processes which they represent, would, so far, be a step toward a philosophical language... <ref> [3, pp.4-5] </ref>. Thus, Logic is a language with signs and rules for combining signs. The mind forms the idea of a class, to which a name (a label or a sign) is given. <p> These laws are found by investigating the mental processes which carry out these acts of classification. 2 The goal of determining laws then led to the discovery of Mathematical Logic, which Boole formulated in The Mathematical Analysis of Logic <ref> [3] </ref> as follows: Further, let us conceive a class of symbols x; y; z; possessed of the following character. The symbol x, operating upon any subject comprehending individuals or classes, shall be supposed to select from that subject all the X's [individuals of some class] which it contains... <p> Boole on the subject. 7 This quotation explains that Logic is a calculus governed by algebraic laws (distributive, commutative, and index), which is the starting point for the use of the MSS. Boole's entire book <ref> [3] </ref> completely develops an Algebraic Logic based on precisely those three laws. This special Algebra is elementary, its main procedure being the solution of systems of algebraic equations. However, it is powerful: it even surpasses somewhat the level of Boole's contemporary Logic (G.

Reference-contexts: spirit of the present study. 3 A brief description can be found in the remark of Section 1. 8 Our subsequent version, boole2, uses a uniform and plausibly humanoid way of representing and reasoning and is able to discover that Logic, Geometry, and a subset of Differential Calculus are symbolizable <ref> [8] </ref>, and that the generalization of Gregory's Geometry is not symbolizable because of its lack of commutativity. boole2's representation and reasoning tools are intended to handle any science as a candidate for symbolization, provided its basic contents can be made accessible to the system.

Reference-contexts: Texts other than Boole's were purely philosophical: they used mostly natural language and, for the sake of a clearer and shorter look, some occasional mathematical symbols, but these symbols lacked algebraic meaning and no mathematical operations involved them (see, for instance, [15] or <ref> [9] </ref>). In his Mathematical Analysis of Logic, G. Boole did not try to mathematize the whole edifice of Logic. Instead, he chose one fundamental operation, the act of election, and two ways of combining it, succession and aggregation (see Section 2.2).
