Reference-contexts: We would like to speed up our im-plementations of these algorithms as much as possible. Possible directions here are branch and bound strategies, and the use of non-euclidean kd-tree structures, <ref> [ Bentley, 1980 ] </ref> . * Non-numerical data. So far we have only applied our algorithms to numerical ratings and numerical features. It would be a simple extension to allow letter grades (A, B, C) or boolean ratings (liked/disliked).

Reference-contexts: extended, and discuss related work. 2 Our Approach A number of groups have begun developing distributed systems to collect and predict consumer preferences, including [ Shardanand and Maes, 1995 ] for the music domain, [ Resnick et al., 1994 ] and [ Lang, 1994 ] for the Usenet domain, and <ref> [ Hill, 1994 ] </ref> for the video domain. Some of these groups have put significant effort into implementation issues to do with user interfaces, and the gathering and communicating of data via Internet and Usenet. The ability to analyze and predict consumer preferences will be increasingly valuable in coming years. <p> Lang is currently working to extend these results to predicting people's ratings of Usenet articles. Will Hill at Bellcore is working on a video recommendation service, <ref> [ Hill, 1994 ] </ref> , and has an Internet site that receives ratings from people. But to our knowledge he has yet to publish results. 7 Conclusions Practical tools to model consumer preferences would be of great benefit in a wide range of domains.

Reference-contexts: We then suggest how this initial work could be extended, and discuss related work. 2 Our Approach A number of groups have begun developing distributed systems to collect and predict consumer preferences, including [ Shardanand and Maes, 1995 ] for the music domain, [ Resnick et al., 1994 ] and <ref> [ Lang, 1994 ] </ref> for the Usenet domain, and [ Hill, 1994 ] for the video domain. Some of these groups have put significant effort into implementation issues to do with user interfaces, and the gathering and communicating of data via Internet and Usenet. <p> They describe one nearest-neighbor prediction scheme, but to our knowledge have not yet published results on appreciable test sets. Lang is also investigating collaborative filtering of Usenet articles, and is developing a system called NewsWeeder, <ref> [ Lang, 1994 ] </ref> . Unlike the above two projects, NewsWeeder looks at the content of the products concerned, processing the text in the Usenet articles.

Reference-contexts: With our current implementation, for each new dataset one first has to tune the parameters for each algorithm. Using cross-validation ( [ Stone, 1974 ] , [ Wahba and Wold, 1975 ] , <ref> [ Moore and Lee, 1994 ] </ref> ) this process could be automated, and also extended to select such things as the best type of weight function.

Reference-contexts: These can then be used to predict any unknown ratings. 8 Our second and third algorithms use an indirect approach and do not assume a linear model. The second algorithm is very similar to the methods described in <ref> [ Resnick et al., 1994, Shardanand and Maes, 1995 ] </ref> . These indirect approaches look for individuals whose past ratings have been in close agreement, and then assume that these individuals will agree on future ratings. <p> We then suggest how this initial work could be extended, and discuss related work. 2 Our Approach A number of groups have begun developing distributed systems to collect and predict consumer preferences, including [ Shardanand and Maes, 1995 ] for the music domain, <ref> [ Resnick et al., 1994 ] </ref> and [ Lang, 1994 ] for the Usenet domain, and [ Hill, 1994 ] for the video domain. <p> We call these people the individual's nearest neighbors. Our prediction is then just a weighted sum of the means-adjusted nearest neighbor ratings for the product concerned. This algorithm is very similar to the methods described in <ref> [ Resnick et al., 1994, Shardanand and Maes, 1995 ] </ref> . We would expect prediction accuracy to improve significantly as the number of consumers in the database increases (and thus the probability of finding people with similar tastes likewise increases). <p> Although their results are drawn from a different domain, they appear to be very similar to those reported here, with mean prediction errors about twenty percent lower than the naive algorithm that uses the average popularity of products. 30 In the Usenet domain, <ref> [ Resnick et al., 1994 ] </ref> discuss the use of collaborative filters and describe a prototype system called GroupLens. They have given considerable thought to the architectural issues involved in integrating such filters into Usenet readers and communicating the article ratings from one Usenet site to another. <p> If we had used the identity function as the weighting function, weight (x) = x, then this method would be essentially equivalent to the method mentioned in <ref> [ Resnick et al., 1994 ] </ref> (see section 6). The restriction to consumers who have rated at least MIN-COMMON of the same products as j is a crude measure.

Our initial results-and those reported in <ref> [ Shardanand and Maes, 1995 ] </ref> - offer perhaps a twenty percent improvement over the naive algorithm that merely looks at the average popularity of products. We hope and expect that further improvement is possible. <p> We call these people the individual's nearest neighbors.

The system has been running on Internet since July 1994, gathering ratings from users via email, and returning recommendations and predictions.
