Abstract: In this paper, we present approaches toward an interactive visualization of a real time input, applied to 3D visualizations of 2D ultrasound echography data. The first, 3degrees-of-freedom (DOF) incremental system visualizes a 3D volume acquired as a stream of 2D slices with location and orientation with 3DOF. As each slice arrives, the system reconstructs a regular 3D volume and renders it. Rendering is done by an incremental image-order ray-casting algorithm which stores and reuses the results of expensive resampling along the rays for speed. The second is our first experiment toward real-time 6DOF acquisition and visualization. 2D slices with 6DOF are reconstructed offline, and visualized at an interactive rate using a parallel volume rendering code running on the graphics multicomputer Pixel-Planes 5.
