Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction It is common in the literature on instrumental variables to remark upon the difficulty of knowing or demonstrating that a potential instrument is exogenous, in the sense of being uncorrelated with the disturbances <ref> [Bartels, 1991, Johnston, 1972] </ref>. It is also widely recognized that exogeneity is an assumption embedded in the model specification [Engle, et al, 1984], hence, it rests on subjective judgment and, like other structural assumptions of causation and "zero-restrictions", it cannot be tested in purely observational studies. <p> In particular, this solution yields the celebrated "instrumental-variable" estimator ^ b = R zy =R zx (14) for the parameter b in Eq. (13), which is known to be consistent only when z is truly uncorrelated with u <ref> [Bartels, 1991] </ref>. Thus, the Instrumental Inequality cannot weed out bad instruments z if all measured variables are normally distributed. The effectiveness of the Instrumental Inequality is realized in non-normal distributions, especially over discrete variables.

Reference-contexts: Although such changes could in principle be explained by strong correlation between u and v (since x does not screen off z), the Instrumental Inequality sets a limit on the magnitude of the changes. The similarity to Bell's Inequality in quantum physics <ref> [Cushing & McMullin, 1989, Suppes, 1988] </ref> is not accidental; both inequalities delineate a class of observed correlations that cannot be explained by hypothesizing latent common causes (in our formulation, common causes are modeled by setting u = v).

Reference-contexts: For example, if all observed variables are binary we obtain the inequalities P (y = 0; x = 0jz = 0) + P (y = 1; x = 0jz = 1) 1 (15) which were derived in the analysis of non-compliance in experimental studies <ref> [Pearl, 1993] </ref>. 3 3 Remarks We see that the Instrumental Inequality is violated when the controlling instrument z manages to produce significant changes in the response variable y while the regressor x remains constant.
