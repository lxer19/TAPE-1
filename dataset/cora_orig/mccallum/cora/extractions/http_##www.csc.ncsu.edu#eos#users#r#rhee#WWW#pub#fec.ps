Abstract: This paper proposes a new error recovery technique for interactive video transmission over error-prone, slow, and bandwidth constrained networks. The technique effectively combines forward error correction (FEC) and retransmission to solve the error propagation problem which is inherent in any motion-based video codecs. Prior work has mainly taken an approach that prevents display errors from occurring from the first place. This approach is not effective for interactive video transmission over the target network environments because data losses inevitably occur in such networks and repairing them tends to introduce the delays in video playout. Our approach is to focus on eliminating error propagation and isolating errors when they occur. This approach allows more time for packet repairs and can effectively mask out delays in repairing lost packets. A simulation study shows that the proposed techniques can be effectively used to transmit high-frame-rate interactive video over slow, error-prone, and bandwidth constrained networks. We name this approach Recovery from Error Spread using Continuous Updates (RESCU). A simulation study shows that under 10% data loss, RESCU-FEC can give a PSNR 1 dB higher than H.261 with 10% less bandwidth. For H.261 to achieve a similar video quality, an experiment shows that it needs about 40% more bandwidth than RESCU-FEC. Further improvement can be achieved when retransmission is combined with RESCU-FEC. It is shown that this hybrid scheme can be used for interactive video transmission over error-prone, high latency networks with higher bit efficiency than RESCU with either FEC or retransmission alone. fl This work is supported by in part by Faculty Research and Professional Development Fund of North Carolina State University. y contact author: email: rhee@csc.ncsu.edu, Phone: 919-515-3305, Fax: 919-515-7925

Reference-contexts: Image distortion in a reference frame can propagate to its succeeding frames and becomes amplified as more bits are lost. Most of earlier work on error recovery focuses on repairing packet losses before the scheduled display times of those video frames contained in lost packets (e.g., <ref> [31, 28, 20, 39, 1, 36, 19, 22] </ref>). However, this approach is ineffective for interactive video because data losses inevitably occur in packet-switched communication, and detecting and repairing losses incur latency. To handle this latency, existing techniques introduce additional delays in frame display times. <p> This latency can significantly impair the interactiveness of any video applications under the current Internet. Forward error correction is also commonly proposed for error recovery of continuous media transmission <ref> [19, 1, 16, 5, 3] </ref>. However, conventional FEC schemes do not work well for interactive video. <p> Since all the coded blocks are temporally independent, packet loss affects only those frames that are contained in lost packets. FEC has been successfully applied to audio transmission [4, 3, 29, 30]. There are only a few studies on applying FEC to video transmission. Priority encoding transmission (PET) <ref> [1, 19, 36] </ref>, encodes different segments of video data with different priority. Each packet contains relatively more redundant information about the higher priority segments of the data, so the information with a higher priority can have a higher chance of correct reception.

Reference-contexts: This latency can significantly impair the interactiveness of any video applications under the current Internet. Forward error correction is also commonly proposed for error recovery of continuous media transmission <ref> [19, 1, 16, 5, 3] </ref>. However, conventional FEC schemes do not work well for interactive video. <p> The PET scheme is also incorporated into vic [25] and is reported a good performance [38]. This good performance is partially due to vic's intracoding which limits error propagation caused by loss of lower priority segments. Bolot and Turletti <ref> [5] </ref> proposed an interesting FEC technique for packet video where a packet contains the redundant information of some of previous packets. The redundant information is created by encoding the image blocks contained in the previous packets with a large quantization step. <p> Most of these techniques focus on preventing lost data from affecting the decoding of received data. Remarks A drawback of proactive techniques is that it wastes bandwidth under error-free transmission. Furthermore, in wireless mobile networks, the assumption made in <ref> [5] </ref> does not hold as long burst losses 18 can be common due to fading and channel interference. Thus, the FEC schemes mentioned above are susceptible to burst errors because both data and FEC-encoded packets have to be transmitted at the same frame interval.

Reference-contexts: Error concealment is one of widely proposed error control techniques (e.g.,[10, 15, 40, 23]). Although error concealment techniques can be combined with error recovery techniques, they are not strictly error recovery techniques <ref> [6] </ref>, so we do not discuss them. We also focus on recovery techniques for video transmission. 16 4.1 Feedback-based recovery Recently H.263+ incorporated two feedback-based techniques: error tracking and reference picture selection.

Reference-contexts: A good balance among the advantages and disadvantages of FEC and retransmission can be achieved if the two schemes can be combined. A hybrid ARQ technique of Type-I <ref> [7] </ref> can be used as follows. First, the original data packets of a periodic frame are sent within its frame interval. Then a small number of their parity packets are transmitted over a fixed interval to guard against random and short burst losses. <p> MPEG-4's techniques can be used along with RESCU to further reduce the effect of data loss. 4.3 Hybrid recovery Hybrid techniques combine ARQ (retransmission) and FEC for better error resilience. There are two types of hybrid techniques: type-I hybrid ARQ <ref> [7] </ref>, and type-II hybrid ARQ [21]. Type-I hybrid ARQ transmits both error detection and correction data at the initial transmission of data. If the receiver cannot recover lost packets using the transmitted parity data, it requests retransmission of the same data from the sender.

Reference-contexts: Several popular video conferencing tools, such as nv [9], vic [25] and CU-SeeMe <ref> [8] </ref>, adopt this approach. Using a technique called conditional replenishment, these tools filter out the blocks that have not changed much from the previous frame and intra-code the remaining blocks. Since all the coded blocks are temporally independent, packet loss affects only those frames that are contained in lost packets.

Reference-contexts: Since in RESCU, late packets are used to restore buffered reference frames, parity packets can be transmitted over a relatively longer period, interleaving with the packets of other frames. The interleaving helps reduce bursty losses of the periodic frame. Note that this interleaving is different from link-level symbol interleaving <ref> [41, 12] </ref> where symbols from multiple codewords are interleaved. The granularity of our proposed interleaving is much larger and thus, more effective. Unlike retransmission, FEC involves no feedback delay, incurring shorter recovery delays and accordingly shorter error propagation.

Reference-contexts: They claimed that if the video source is not bursty, long burst losses are rare, and the proposed scheme would work well for video. H.263+ also includes a similar technique called independent segment decoding (ISD) <ref> [17] </ref>. In the ISD mode, each video slice is encoded as an individual picture (or subvideo) independent of other slices. In particular, each slice boundary is treated just like picture boundary. ISD does not eliminate error propagation, but limits the extent of error propagation to a slice.

Reference-contexts: Image distortion in a reference frame can propagate to its succeeding frames and becomes amplified as more bits are lost. Most of earlier work on error recovery focuses on repairing packet losses before the scheduled display times of those video frames contained in lost packets (e.g., <ref> [31, 28, 20, 39, 1, 36, 19, 22] </ref>). However, this approach is ineffective for interactive video because data losses inevitably occur in packet-switched communication, and detecting and repairing losses incur latency. To handle this latency, existing techniques introduce additional delays in frame display times. <p> To handle this latency, existing techniques introduce additional delays in frame display times. However, delaying frame playout times greatly impairs the interactiveness of video communication. Many researchers <ref> [31, 28, 20, 39] </ref> have proposed using retransmission of lost packets by delaying frame playout times to allow arrival of retransmitted packets before their display times. Any packets received after their display times will be discarded. <p> The retransmitted packet arrives at time t 3 which is before frame 3 is displayed. Packet 3 is now used to restore the R-frame of frame 3, so frame 3 can be decoded and displayed without an error. Our retransmission technique is fundamentally different from other retransmission schemes <ref> [31, 28, 20, 39] </ref> in that it does not introduce any delay in frame playout times. In interactive video conferencing, introducing a delay in frame playout times severely impairs interactive communication. Thus, the previously proposed schemes do not work well in this environment. <p> Since motion prediction is always based on the frames that are received by the receiver, error propagation is effectively eliminated. Retransmission has recently attracted much attention for packet loss recovery in video transmission. Ramamurthy and Raychaudhuri <ref> [31] </ref> applied a similar technique to video transmission over ATM. They analyzed the performance of video transmission over an ATM network when both retransmission and error concealment are used to repair errors occurring from cell loss.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, since FEC is applied to a block of packets, before FEC-encoded redundant packets is computed and transmitted, large delay must transpire. In our earlier work <ref> [32, 33] </ref>, we proposed an entirely complementary approach to these earlier ap 2 proaches by focusing on eliminating error propagation when distortion on displayed images happens. Our point of departure from previously proposed approaches is that packets do not have to arrive in time for display to be useful. <p> We named this approach Recovery from Error Spread using Continuous Updates (RESCU). RESCU has been shown effective for interactive video transmission when retransmission is used to recover lost packets <ref> [32, 33] </ref>. However, retransmission tends to prolong error propagation. because of the delay involved in detecting and repairing lost packets. Moreover, in some networks such as wireless cable modems and direct satellites, feedback channels are contentious, and bandwidth-limited. <p> Since retransmission can recovers long burst losses, many parity packets do not have to be sent a priori, which reduces wasted bandwidth. 3 Simulation We showed the efficacy of RESCU with retransmission in <ref> [33, 32] </ref>. In this section, we show through simulation that the performance of RESCU can be enhanced by incorporating FEC.

Reference-contexts: This n packets is called as a FEC block. The RSE decoder at the receiver side can reconstruct the source data packets using any k packets out of its FEC block. Efficient (n; k) RSE encoding and decoding algorithms have been developed and implemented to achieve real-time performance <ref> [2, 14, 34, 27] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: They showed that using rate-compatible punctured convolutional (RCPC) codes [11, 13], one or two retransmission attempts achieve a low packet error rate under a perfectly interleaved Rayleigh fading channel. Hybrid ARQ techniques were also studied in reliable multicast <ref> [35, 27] </ref>. While FEC helps reduce occurrences of independent losses, retransmission repairs correlated packet losses. They showed that hybrid ARQ reduces the bandwidth overhead of repairing packet losses in reliable multicast involving many receivers.

Priority encoding transmission (PET) <ref> [1, 19, 36] </ref>, encodes different segments of video data with different priority.

Reference-contexts: In particular, each slice boundary is treated just like picture boundary. ISD does not eliminate error propagation, but limits the extent of error propagation to a slice. MPEG-4 adopted several error resilient techniques for wireless video transmission <ref> [37] </ref>. These include resynchronizations strategies, data partitioning, reversible VLCs, and header extension codes. Most of these techniques focus on preventing lost data from affecting the decoding of received data. Remarks A drawback of proactive techniques is that it wastes bandwidth under error-free transmission.

Reference-contexts: Each packet contains relatively more redundant information about the higher priority segments of the data, so the information with a higher priority can have a higher chance of correct reception. The PET scheme is also incorporated into vic [25] and is reported a good performance <ref> [38] </ref>. This good performance is partially due to vic's intracoding which limits error propagation caused by loss of lower priority segments. Bolot and Turletti [5] proposed an interesting FEC technique for packet video where a packet contains the redundant information of some of previous packets.

Reference-contexts: Since in RESCU, late packets are used to restore buffered reference frames, parity packets can be transmitted over a relatively longer period, interleaving with the packets of other frames. The interleaving helps reduce bursty losses of the periodic frame. Note that this interleaving is different from link-level symbol interleaving <ref> [41, 12] </ref> where symbols from multiple codewords are interleaved. The granularity of our proposed interleaving is much larger and thus, more effective. Unlike retransmission, FEC involves no feedback delay, incurring shorter recovery delays and accordingly shorter error propagation.
