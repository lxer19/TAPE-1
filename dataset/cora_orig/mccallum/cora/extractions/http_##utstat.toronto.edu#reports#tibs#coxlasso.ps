Abstract: We propose a new method for variable selection and estimation in Cox's proportional hazards model. Our proposal minimizes the log partial likelihood subject to the sum of the absolute values of the parameters being bounded by a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly zero and hence gives interpretable models. The method is a variation of the "lasso" proposal of Tibshirani (1994), designed for the linear regression context. Simulations indicate that the lasso can be more accurate than stepwise selection in this setting.

Reference-contexts: The distinct failure times are denoted by t 1 &lt; &lt; t k , there being d i failures at time t i . The proportional-hazards model for survival data, also known as the Cox model <ref> (Cox, 1972) </ref>, assumes that (tjx) = 0 (t) exp j 1 where (tjx) is the hazard at time t given predictor values x = (x 1 ; . . . ; x p ), and 0 (t) is an arbitrary baseline hazard function.

Reference-contexts: Minimize (z Xfi) T A (z Xfi) subject to P 4. Repeat steps (2) and (3) until ^ fi doesn't change. Note that if an unconstrained minimization were instead used in step 3, this procedure would be equivalent to the usual Newton-Raphson algorithm for maximizing the partial likelihood <ref> (Hastie and Tibshirani 1990, chapter 8) </ref>. One difficulty with the above procedure is that A is a full matrix and hence it requires computation of O (N 2 ) elements. We can avoid this however by replacing A by a diagonal matrix D, having the same diagonal elements as A.
