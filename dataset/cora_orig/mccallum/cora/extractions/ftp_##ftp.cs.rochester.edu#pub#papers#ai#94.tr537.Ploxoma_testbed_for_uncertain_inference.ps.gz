Abstract: This report compares two formalisms for uncertain inference, Combinatorial Semantics and Dempster-Shafer belief function theory, on the basis of an example from the domain of medical diagnosis. We review Shafer's example about the imaginary disease ploxoma and show how it would be represented in Combinatorial Semantics. We conclude that belief function theory has a qualitative advantage because it offers greater flexibility of expression, and provides results about more specific classes of patients. Nevertheless, a quantitative comparison reveals that the inferences sanctioned by Combinatorial Semantics are more reliable than those of belief function theory.

Reference-contexts: This point is mentioned as early as <ref> [Dempster, 1967] </ref>. 19 of an analyst's state of uncertainty about the real world. We believe that it is literally impossible to answer the question outside the context of real examples based on attempts to construct formal representations of uncertainty reflecting actual uncertain knowledge of the real world.

Reference-contexts: Combinatorial Semantics may be less flexible in its representation of knowledge, may yield less "informative" conclusions, but at least the inferences it does sanction are not misleading. However, the practical usefulness of Combinatorial Semantics has yet to be demonstrated. Dempster and Kong <ref> [Dempster and Kong, 1987, p. 33] </ref> emphasize that we cannot evaluate a theory of uncertain inference without reference to its practical applications.

Reference-contexts: In the tradition of Smets [Smets, 1991; Smets, 1994], we center our investigation on a concrete instance chosen not as a counterexample, nor as a philosophical conundrum like the three prisoner problem <ref> [Diaconis, 1978; Diaconis and Zabell, 1986] </ref>, but as a basis for contrasting alternative analyses. A good example is a valuable tool to isolate the points of difference among theories, and to identify their strengths and weaknesses.

Reference-contexts: How shall we interpret this relationship? Classical probability theory provides a common framework in which to evaluate belief function theory and Combinatorial Semantics. <ref> [Kyburg, 1987] </ref> has shown that to any belief function BEL, defined over a frame of discernment , there corresponds a closed, convex set P of classical probability functions, where P = f P r : P r is a probability function and 8A (BEL (A) P r (A) PL (A)) g <p> Belief function methodology does introduce more complexity into the class of available representations of uncertainty : : : The important question is whether the added flexibility is necessary in practice to permit satisfactory representation 12 This comes as no surprise in light of Theorem A.3 in <ref> [Kyburg, 1987, pp. 286-287] </ref>, which states that the lower and upper bounds on the conditional probability derived using Bayes' Rule are always as wide (and often wider) than the belief-plausibility intervals resulting from Dempster conditioning.
