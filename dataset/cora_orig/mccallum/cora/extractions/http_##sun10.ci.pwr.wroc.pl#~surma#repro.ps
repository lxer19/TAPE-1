Abstract: Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) paradigm is very close to the designer behavior during the conceptual design, and seems to be a fruitable computer aided-design approach if a library of design cases is available. The goal of this paper is to presents the general framework of a case-based retrieval system: REPRO, that supports chemical process design. The crucial problems like the case representation and structural similarity measure are widely described. The presented experimental results and the expert evaluation shows usefulness of the described system in real world problems. The papers ends with discussion concerning research problems and future work.

Reference-contexts: Several approaches were made in this field including: analogical reasoning (Holyoak & Thagard 1989, Falkenhainer et. al. 1989), conceptual graphs (Myaeng & Lopez-Lopez 1992, Maher 1993), and objectoriented representation <ref> (Bisson 1995) </ref>. In CBR the mentioned FABEL project investigates several approaches to structural similarity based on: graph theory, term-based representation, gestalt indices and psychological theories of perception (Voss et al. 1994a). <p> The uniqueness property fundamentally reduces a complexity of the matching process, but requires deep knowledge acquisition. The similarity measure based only on the same type components is under consideration. One of the most promissing approaches for this problem is described in the Bisson paper <ref> (Bisson 1995) </ref>. Based on the expert suggestions two similarity measures between the input flowsheet aggregation ( Y I ) and the retrieved flowsheet aggregation ( Y R ) were created. First, the aggregation similarity treats the flowsheets as a set of components.

Reference-contexts: PFDs represent complex processes, that can be defined as systems that generate required output products from a given set of input feedstocks under appropriate operating conditions. These processes can be represented at different levels of abstraction corresponding to different phases in the design <ref> (Douglas 1988) </ref>: conceptual (synthesis) phase: only the most important functions, connections, and input/output streams are represented in Block Diagrams; basic engineering design phase: all equipments, connections, streams, some operating conditions (pressure, temperature, flow rates) are represented in PFDs; additional detailed information such as the control systems, utilities, sensors are represented in

Reference-contexts: This mean that in opposite to the most CBR systems the similarity measure for flowsheets should be based not only on the local structure of the objects but on the relational structure existing between them as well. Several approaches were made in this field including: analogical reasoning <ref> (Holyoak & Thagard 1989, Falkenhainer et. al. 1989) </ref>, conceptual graphs (Myaeng & Lopez-Lopez 1992, Maher 1993), and objectoriented representation (Bisson 1995).

Reference-contexts: The instances in the process taxonomy are aggregation taxonomies that represent the flowsheet itself: the flowsheet aggregation (e.g. Flowsheet-1). Aggregation is the relationship (transitive and antisymetric) in which objects representing the components are associated with an object representing the entire assembly <ref> (Rumbaugh et al., 1991) </ref>. Figure 1 illustrates the process taxonomy, and the component taxonomy that is the source of components for a flowsheet aggregation. For example a Flowsheet-1 consists of a Pump-1, Reactor-1, and Pipe-1.

We adopted this approach <ref> (Surma & Braunschweig 1995) </ref> and finally the following classes were defined: the generalization taxonomy of flowsheet components: the component taxonomy (e.g., Reactor). the class defining pipes (stream) connections between components: the class PIPE. the generalization taxonomy of available chemical processes: the process taxo-xonomy (e.g., Hydrogenation C3).

Reference-contexts: This functional information saves a lot of computation but implies more input from the user. The paper extends <ref> (Surma & Braunschweig 1996) </ref> by showing the detailed structural similarity calculation and some results on a relatively complex process example. At present there is considerable growing interest in the use of CBR in design activities. <p> In fact in each flowsheet (after careful function labeling) there are no two or more of the same type components performing the same function: the uniqueness property. The practical utilization of this property and the role of the quantity slot is discussed in Surma and Braunschweig paper <ref> (Surma & Braunschweig 1996) </ref>. The uniqueness property fundamentally reduces a complexity of the matching process, but requires deep knowledge acquisition. The similarity measure based only on the same type components is under consideration. One of the most promissing approaches for this problem is described in the Bisson paper (Bisson 1995). <p> A predicate that belongs to a mappable system of mutually interconnecting relationships is more likely to be imported into target than is an isolated predicate. 4 Case Retrieval in REPRO The knowledge representation and structural similarity for flowsheets introduced in the previous sections have been implemented in the REPRO system <ref> (Surma 1996) </ref>. The main task of REPRO is the case-based retrieval of flowsheets based on the aggregation and/or connection similarity. The system has been implemented on a SUN 10 Sparc workstation with the G2 expertsystem development environment.

The flowsheet might be treated as a graph, that implies the use one of the know approaches, which are mostly NP-complete. But the availability of the domain knowledge and the specific nature of the flowsheets allow to create a flowsheet-specific measure that is computationally acceptable.
