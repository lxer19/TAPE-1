Abstract: The aim of this study is to present the "Incremental Polynomial Model-Controller Network" (IPMCN). This network is composed of controllers each one attached to a model used for its indirect design. At each instant the controller connected to the model performing the best is selected. An automatic network construction algorithm is discribed in this study. It makes the IPMCN a self-organising non-linear controller. However the emphasis is on the polynomial controllers that are the building blocks of the IPMCN. From an analysis of the properties of polynomial functions for system modelling it is shown that multiple low order odd polynomials are very suitable to model non-linear systems. A closed loop reference model method to design a controller from a odd polynomial model is then described. The properties of the IPMCN are illustrated according to a second order system having both system states y and _y involving non-linear behaviour. It shows that as a component of a network or alone, a low order odd polynomial controller performs much better than a linear adaptive controller. Moreover, the number of controllers is significantly reduced with the increase of the polynomial order of the controllers and an improvement of the control performance is proportional to the decrease of the number of controllers. In addition, the clustering free approach, applied for the selection of the controllers, makes the IPMCN insensitive to the number of quantities involving nonlinearity in the system. The use of local controllers capable of handling systems with complex dynamics will make this scheme one of the most effective approaches for the control of non-linear systems.

Reference-contexts: If the function is discontinuous, adaptive control cannot be applied. In addition, the slowness 1 of such an adaptation may result in a large transient error (Narendra et al., 1995). A more serious problem is the basic design problem for learning machines emphasised by <ref> (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1988) </ref>: the "stability-plasticity dilemma". While the controller is adapting to an operating region of the system it is forgetting previous adaptations concerning other regions. <p> All the model-controller pairs are adapted; but, because multiple models are used, there is no need to use a forgetting factor. Indeed, such forgetting would be harmful as it would loose pertaining to the particular model. This gives "stability" is the sense of <ref> (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1988) </ref> in the context of the the "stability-plasticity dilemma". On the other hand, the "plasticity" arises from the generation of new models as described in the next section. 3 A network of feedback controllers. A gating system is used to select only one controller at each instant.

Reference-contexts: The interpolation between points is catastrophic for the polynomial function of order 12 (see graph "Poly12 approximation"). In addition to this oscillation problem, when the functions to be identified are not smooth, polynomial functions are not really suitable for the modelling. Hence, as emphasised by <ref> (Lancaster and Salkauskas, 1986) </ref>, it is much more efficient to use piecewise polynomial functions of low order to obtain an accurate and flexible fit of an unknown function, rather than trying to find a single polynomial function fitting the data.

Reference-contexts: The control version of the LMN is the "Local Controller Network". The concept underlying the other controller network has been introduced in <ref> (Middleton et al., 1988) </ref> and further extended in (Morse, 1990; Morse et al., 1992; Weller and Goodwin, 1994) and is know as the "hysteresis switching algorithm". <p> This actually implies far more computations than the selection of the controller using the clustering approach described in the previous section. We have not evaluated the "hysteresis" feature, introduced in <ref> (Middleton et al., 1988) </ref> and used also in the MSM, in the context of the MCN. Such hysteresis implies a time delay between the selection of a new controller and its activation; this avoids potential instability arising from a rapid change of controllers.

Reference-contexts: Such a method can only be effective if the dynamics of the system are changing smoothly and quite slowly through time. If the function is discontinuous, adaptive control cannot be applied. In addition, the slowness 1 of such an adaptation may result in a large transient error <ref> (Narendra et al., 1995) </ref>. A more serious problem is the basic design problem for learning machines emphasised by (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1988): the "stability-plasticity dilemma". While the controller is adapting to an operating region of the system it is forgetting previous adaptations concerning other regions. <p> By removing the INC one makes the MCN entering a generalisation stage. Note also that a similar technique than the INC is reported in <ref> (Narendra et al., 1995) </ref>. However, their method contains no pruning feature.

Reference-contexts: This is closely related to the control strategy known as gain scheduling (see, for instance, (Shamma and Athans, 1990; Shamma and Athans, 1992)). There are a couple of algorithms that have been recently developed for this purpose. One of them is the "Local Model Network" introduced in <ref> (Poggio and Girosi, 1990) </ref> and further extended for modelling and control purposes by (Johansen and Foss, 1993; Johansen and Foss, 1992). The control version of the LMN is the "Local Controller Network".

Reference-contexts: This problem has been resolved by developing the "Incremental Network Construction" (INC) algorithm (see chapter 3 in <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref> for full details about this algorithm, (Ronco et al., 1996a; Ronco et al., 1996b; Ronco and Gaw-throp, 1997a; Ronco and Gawthrop, 1997b) for an early version of this algorithm or (Ronco and Gawthrop, submittedb; Ronco and Gawthrop, submitteda; Ronco and Gawthrop, 1997c) for a further improved version). <p> describes the main features of the " Model-Controller Network" (MCN) and the algorithm used to automatically construct its architecture: the "Incremental Network Construction" (INC) algorithm. 2.1 Model-Controller Network The "Multiple Switched Model" (MSM) has been extensively studied in (Narendra et al., 1995; Narendra and Balakrishan, 1997) (See chapter 3 in <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref> for details about this algorithm). The MSM is a network of model-controller pairs where each controller is designed from its connected model (See figure 1). There are various possibilities to compose the network. One can use solely fixed or adaptive model-controller pairs or a combination of them. <p> Hence, the overall modelling and control of the plant is significantly facilitated by an incremental construction of the network of model-controller pairs. Such an algorithm has been developed in <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref> and is called the "Incremental Network Construction" (INC). The idea of the INC is to construct the architecture of the MCN on-line whilst controlling the plant. <p> From those samples a local model of the system is determined. A linear controller is then designed from this model using any conventional method; A Model Reference Adaptive Controller design method is used in this study (see <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref> chapter 1 for details about this control design method). The new model-controller pair is finally added to the MCN. Note that the value of the threshold should be chosen so as to meet the control requirements since a small threshold implies a very accurate control. <p> An other argument for the use of cubic polynomial models rather than any other is that, when using a regression method such as the singular value decomposition (SVD) (see <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref> chapter 1 for details about this algorithm), it is possible to make a low order polynomial model (e.g. a cubic polynomial model) approximate any polynomial function of the same or lower order than its own (for some illustrative results see (Ronco and Gawthrop, 1997b)). <p> The minimisation of equation (11) is then simply accomplished by performing a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of S and choosing the singular vector corresponding to the smallest singular value (see <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref> chapter 1 for details concerning parameter estimation using SVD). 4.2 Reference model polynomial controller design The purpose of this section is to describe the method for designing a Model Reference Adaptive Polynomial Controller (MRAPC) which is the polynomial version of the Model Reference Ad aptive Controller (MRAC) described in <p> 1 for details concerning parameter estimation using SVD). 4.2 Reference model polynomial controller design The purpose of this section is to describe the method for designing a Model Reference Adaptive Polynomial Controller (MRAPC) which is the polynomial version of the Model Reference Ad aptive Controller (MRAC) described in details in <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref> chapter 1. Note that although the design method will involves a single controller, this of course applies to the design of any of the local controllers composing the MCN. A MRAC is a very intuitive way of designing controllers. <p> One can easily work out these constants according to the maximum desired overshoot and the settling time (see <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref> chapter 1 for details). Note that this reference model of the closed loop system is linear rather than polynomial. This means that although we are dealing with non-linear models and therefore non linear controllers the closed loop system is linear. <p> X r i a i ) i=1 X a j2 s Ni y P 0 +42j A (17) where P 0 = P odd +1 2 with P odd 3 being the odd polynomial order. 12 Note that this MRAC is not able to handle systems with complex dynamics (see <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref> chapter 1 for details about the properties of this controller). <p> u + r 1 a 1 )sy + r 2 a 2 )y + c i=1 X a j2 s 2i y P 0 +42j A (19) where r 1 = 1:5, r 2 = 1:84 are the parameters of the reference model of the closed loop control system (see <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref> chapter 1 for details), b 1 , b 2 , a 1 , a 2 and c are the parameters of a second order local model of the system, a p j2 are the parameters related to the polynomials of the system output y and P 0 = P

Reference-contexts: such as the singular value decomposition (SVD) (see (Ronco, 1997) chapter 1 for details about this algorithm), it is possible to make a low order polynomial model (e.g. a cubic polynomial model) approximate any polynomial function of the same or lower order than its own (for some illustrative results see <ref> (Ronco and Gawthrop, 1997b) </ref>). For instance, whilst approximating a linear function, the singular value decomposition can deduce that only the parameters related to the first order polynomial terms are crucial. Hence, the other parameters are identified as zero.
