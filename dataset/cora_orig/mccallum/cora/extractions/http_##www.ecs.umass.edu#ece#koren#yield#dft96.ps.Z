Abstract: As semiconductor technology enters the deep submicron era, reliability has become a major challenge in the design and manufacturing of next generation VLSI circuits. In this paper we focus on one reliability issue the antenna effect in the context of 3-layer channel routing. We first present an antenna effect model in 3-layer channel routing and, based on this, an antenna effect cost function is proposed. A layer reassignment approach is adopted to minimize this cost function and we show that the layer reassignment problem can be formulated as a network bipartitioning problem. Experimental results show that the antenna effect can be reduced considerably by applying the proposed technique. Compared with previous work, one advantage of our approach is that no extra channel area is required for antenna effect minimization. We show that layer reassignment technique can be used in yield-related critical area minimization in 3-layer channel routing as well. The trade-off between these two objectives is also presented. Continued advances in IC technology along with the development of packaging technologies with superior thermal characteristics enable an increase in the level of integration of VLSI systems. In this process, the aggressive scaling of device and interconnect dimensions has played, and in the foreseeable future will still play, an important role in achieving significant improvements in VLSI performance and circuit density. However, scaling has a detrimental effect on reliability due to increase in current density, electric field, leakage currents and oxide breakdown [1]. As a result, reliability has become a major issue and challenge in the design and manufacturing of next generation deep-submicron VLSI circuits [2, 3, 4, 5]. In this paper, we focus on the antenna effect [6, 7, 8, 9], one of the important reliability issues in today's VLSI systems, in the routing stage of VLSI design. The antenna problem is a side effect of various plasma-based manufacturing processes such as etching, etc. These plasma-based processes are widely used to get the fine feature size of modern IC. Plasma etchers or ion implanters can induce a voltage into isolated leads, overstressing thin gate oxides. The leads (polysilicon or metal) act like an antenna to collect charges and the accumulated charges may result in oxide breakdown. These charges may also have a negative effect on hot-carrier device aging lifetime [10]. As device scaling goes on, the oxides of new devices are getting thinner and thinner and, as a result, the problem of antenna effect is expected to become worse and worse.

Reference-contexts: The only published research in the area of routing for antenna effect minimization has been done at the University of California in Santa Barbara by Wang et al <ref> [11] </ref>. They proposed several techniques to minimize the antenna effect in 3-layer channel routing. One drawback of their approach is the penalty of channel height increase. <p> We study 3-layer channel routing in this paper. The two most common routing styles for 3-layer channel routing are HVH (horizontal-vertical-horizontal) and VHV (vertical-horizontal-vertical). In <ref> [11] </ref>, it was shown that in VHV routing, the length of each antenna can be limited to the height of the routing channel by insisting that for each net its driver is connected to a vertical wire segment in layer one. <p> This is mainly due to the high channel density in the Deutsch difficult example resulting in less room for yield improvement than in other examples. Since the 3-layer channel router used in <ref> [11] </ref> is unavailable [22], we cannot use their router to generate antenna effect optimized routing solutions for the benchmark examples and compare them with those obtained by our layer reassignment technique. The only comparison we can do is comparing our result on the Deutsch difficult example with theirs. <p> Since they don't consider the critical area in their approach, we use the result when a = 1.0. Both results for the Deutsch difficult example are shown in Table 4. max antenna length average antenna length #tracks used Result in <ref> [11] </ref> 15 7.22 14 Our Result 14.02 7.54 10 Table 4: Comparison with previous work. From Table 4, we can see that the two approaches achieve similar quality solutions for the Deutsch difficult example in terms of maximum antenna length and average antenna length. However, in [11] 14 tracks were used, <p> #tracks used Result in <ref> [11] </ref> 15 7.22 14 Our Result 14.02 7.54 10 Table 4: Comparison with previous work. From Table 4, we can see that the two approaches achieve similar quality solutions for the Deutsch difficult example in terms of maximum antenna length and average antenna length. However, in [11] 14 tracks were used, while we use only 10 tracks. This corresponds to a 30% savings in channel area. 6: Conclusion A layer reassignment technique has been developed to minimize the antenna effect in 3-layer channel routing.

Reference-contexts: This suggests that the antenna effect can usually be eliminated in VHV routing. We will therefore focus on HVH routing, which is also more important than VHV routing in practice since a HVH router can usually achieve a better result than a VHV router <ref> [12] </ref>. In HVH routing, two layers can be used to route horizontal wire segments. Without losing generality, we assume that the two horizontal layers in all the examples used in this paper are Metal 1 and Metal 3, respectively, and the vertical layer is Metal 2.

Reference-contexts: classical network bipartitioning problem, but they are not identical since we are minimizing here the objective function defined in (1) and (2) instead of the total weighted cuts between the bipartite subgraphs. 4: Relation with Yield Enhancement Since layer reassignment can also be used for reducing yield related critical area <ref> [16] </ref>, it is interesting to compare solutions for these two different objectives. <p> We further assume that the probabilities of short-circuit faults for Metal 1 and Metal 3 are the same. Under this assumption, the weight of a edge between two clusters can be defined as Critical Area diff Critical Area same <ref> [16] </ref>, where Critical Area diff and Critical Area same are the critical areas between these two clusters when the reference wires of these two clusters are assigned to different layers and the same layer, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we can focus on the critical area for short-circuit faults, which are also much more important than open-circuit faults in practice <ref> [17] </ref>. Since the vertical wires are kept unchanged during layer reassignment, so does the critical area between vertical wires. As a result, we only need to consider the critical area between horizontal wires.

Reference-contexts: We ignore the critical area between two wires which are not in adjacent tracks, and this simplification is based on the observation that the diameter x of a defect has a density function f (x) that decreases as 1=x 3 <ref> [18] </ref>, and therefore, the error introduced by ignoring the critical area between non-adjacent wire segments is small. Similar to layer reassignment for antenna effect minimization, we use clusters to represent a group of wire segments.

Reference-contexts: This is mainly due to the high channel density in the Deutsch difficult example resulting in less room for yield improvement than in other examples. Since the 3-layer channel router used in [11] is unavailable <ref> [22] </ref>, we cannot use their router to generate antenna effect optimized routing solutions for the benchmark examples and compare them with those obtained by our layer reassignment technique. The only comparison we can do is comparing our result on the Deutsch difficult example with theirs.
