Abstract: The Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) scheduling discipline is an important scheduling mechanism that can support both class isolation and bandwidth sharing among different service classes, thus making it an appealing choice for networks providing multiple services with Quality-of-Service guarantees. In this paper, we study a broad class of GPS networks known as Consistent Relative Session Treatment (CRST) GPS networks and establish closed-form end-to-end performance bounds for CRST GPS networks. This result generalizes the results of Parekh and Gallager [9] where simple, closed-form end-to-end performance bounds are derived for a special sub-class of CRST GPS networks, the so-called Rate Proportional Processor Sharing (RPPS) GPS networks, but performance bounds for the general CRST GPS networks do not have closed-form. Our result is obtained through the notion of CRST partition, which in fact yields a broader class of CRST GPS networks than the one originally defined in [8]. Moreover, our approach is quite general. It not only applies to the deterministic analysis of GPS networks, but can also be employed in the study of GPS networks in a stochastic setting.

Reference-contexts: Although we have focused primarily on CRST GPS networks with leaky bucket regulated sessions, the results can also be generalized to CRST GPS networks where the session traffic is modeled by other traffic models, say, the deterministic minimum envelope process model <ref> [1] </ref>. Moreover, the end-to-end sample path bounds obtained for CRST GPS networks is independent of the traffic models, and can be applied to establish closed-form, end-to-end bounds for backlog and delay tail distributions for sessions characterized by stochastic processes [12].

Reference-contexts: In the seminal papers [8, 9], Parekh and Gallager present a thorough examination of GPS scheduling under a deterministic model where source traffic of each session is regulated by a (; )-leaky bucket regulator [10] (hence traffic from each session conforms to Cruz's Linear Bounded Arrival Process (LBAP) traffic model <ref> [3] </ref>). In the case of a single GPS server in isolation, it is shown that the backlog and delay of each session are bounded from above provided that the total arrival rate of the sessions is smaller than the service rate. <p> Or equivalently, the arrival process A i of session i (after regulation) can be modeled by the so-called a ( i ; i )-Linear Bounded Arrival Process (LBAP) <ref> [3] </ref>. We say an arrival process A i conforms to (or is) a ( i ; i )-LBAP if A i (t; t) i (t t ) + i over any time interval [t; t].
