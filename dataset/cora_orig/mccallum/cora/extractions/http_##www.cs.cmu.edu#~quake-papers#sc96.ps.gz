Reference-contexts: It is now generally recognized that while one- and two-dimensional local models can help explain observed behavior in certain situations, a complete quantitative understanding of strong ground motion in large basins requires a simultaneous consideration of three-dimensional effects of earthquake source, propagation path, and local site conditions. See <ref> [1] </ref> for a general overview, and [12, 11, 22, 8, 9, 18, 16], for instance, for representative recent work in this field.

Reference-contexts: These boundaries allow the passage of outgoing waves with minimum reflection. Since, in many cases, the earthquake source can be outside the computational domain, its effect must be introduced into the region. This is carried out as described in <ref> [3, 6] </ref> by means of effective forces. In short, for an arbitrary earthquake excitation these forces are determined in terms of the free-field motion by introducing a fictitious auxiliary surface that surrounds the basin. Across this auxiliary surface one imposes the conditions of continuity of displacement and traction.

Reference-contexts: In order to render the computational domain finite, we introduce absorbing boundaries at the bottom and sides of the basin that are local in both space and time <ref> [4, 10] </ref>. These boundaries allow the passage of outgoing waves with minimum reflection. Since, in many cases, the earthquake source can be outside the computational domain, its effect must be introduced into the region. This is carried out as described in [3, 6] by means of effective forces.

Reference-contexts: This set of nodes is then triangulated (more properly, tetrahedralized) according to the Delaunay criterion. 2 Figure 3 shows the resulting mesh of tetrahedra. Delaunay tetrahedralization is performed by a straightforward implementation of the Bowyer/Watson incremental algorithm <ref> [5, 23] </ref>, which constructs a triangulation by adding one node at a time and locally adjusting the mesh to maintain the Delaunay criterion.

In addition to the finite element method we describe in this paper, there have been recent efforts to endow finite difference wave propagation methods with multi-resolution capabilities. See the work described in <ref> [14] </ref>, which uses composites of regular grids to achieve variable resolution. 3 Algorithms In this section we discuss the numerical and geometric algorithms necessary for modeling earthquake-induced ground motion in large, heterogeneous basins.

Reference-contexts: The partitioner we use is based on the algorithm of Miller, Teng, Thurston, and Vavasis <ref> [15] </ref>. This algorithm uses geometric information to construct a separator, i.e. a set of nodes whose removal separates the mesh into two pieces of roughly equal size. Each of these pieces is then recursively partitioned until the desired number of subdomains is reached. <p> For the largest problems, such as the Greater Los Angeles Basin at a frequency of 2Hz, sequential mesh generation may become a bottleneck. We may parallelize this task in the future. Archimedes' toolset also includes Slice, an implementation of the asymptotically optimal mesh partitioner <ref> [15] </ref> discussed in Section 3.2. Once Slice partitions a mesh into subdomains, its output is fed to Parcel, which prepares input for the parallel program. Parcel generates the communication schedule for each processor, the global-to-local mapping information for the mesh nodes and elements, and the local stiffness matrix structure.

Reference-contexts: Such failures became increasingly common for us as the size of our meshes grew. To overcome this problem, we have developed a method for fast exact arithmetic that is particularly well-suited for certain tests that arise in computational geometry codes <ref> [19] </ref>. Our method is used to construct predicates that determine whether a point falls to the left or right side of a line, or whether a point falls inside or outside a sphere.

Reference-contexts: For implicit methods, the Archimedes language provides for expression of various stationary iterative solvers as well as Krylov subspace methods. Furthermore, users can add new primitives as the need arises. Triangle <ref> [20] </ref> is a two-dimensional quality mesh generator in the Archimedes toolset. Triangle operates on a description of the input geometry and produces a two-dimensional triangular mesh with guaranteed angle bounds that satisfies user-specified bounds on element size.
