Title: Computational Emotion  
Author: Ajit Narayanan and Jeremy Olsen

Abstract: Classical accounts of emotion are coming under increasing attack as advances are made in neuroscience, resulting in claims that emotion is not amenable to a classical, symbolic treatment. The implication is that symbolic computational models of emotion are irrelevant and that neurocomputational models based on artificial neural networks (connectionism) offer a better approach. This paper identifies some problems with the neurocomputational approach, especially if the neurocomputational model is intended to be eliminative of the symbolic account. An integrated architecture is proposed which takes into account (a) developments in neuroscience as well as (b) classical symbolic treatments.

Reference-contexts: An emergent model of emotion can then be provided by neuroscience once research is sufficiently advanced. Having a neuroscientific base to emotions is not inconsistent with a commonsense conception of emotion (e.g. (x)(p)[(x fears that p) (x desires that :p)] <ref> (P.M. Churchland, 1981) </ref>, where different emotion types are related. Such relationships must be supported by co-occurrences of neural activity in the appropriate neural regions. Nor is a neuroscientific base incompatible with the idea that emotions then cause motor activity (by some mechanism which is not yet fully understood).

Reference-contexts: These activities are, however, all very clinically definable and involve what Gelernter (1994) would call `high focus thought'. To get closer to real world experiences such as emotion we need to ask if current `model nets can solve only problems clearly isolated from their messiness au naturel ' <ref> (P.S. Churchland and Sejnowski, 1992, p 125) </ref>: current models `generally have not addressed a range of critically important factors such as attention and arousal, the role of emotions such as fear, hope, and joy, the role of moods, desires, expectations ...' (P.S. Churchland and Sejnowski, 1992, 413). <p> Churchland and Sejnowski, 1992, p 125): current models `generally have not addressed a range of critically important factors such as attention and arousal, the role of emotions such as fear, hope, and joy, the role of moods, desires, expectations ...' <ref> (P.S. Churchland and Sejnowski, 1992, 413) </ref>. Perhaps to tackle these areas current network architectures are not sufficiently detailed, being only crude approximations to brain structure. To find more appropriate models we will have to look at the fields of neuroscience and computational neuroscience.

Reference-contexts: The idea of interpreting emotion as a set of computationally realisable rules (however complex) may seem to some to be an approach which fails to grasp exactly what emotions are and how they affect us. One attempt along these lines is PARRY <ref> (Colby et al., 1971) </ref> | a system which simulates the human emotion of paranoia using a traditional symbolic programming approach. Basically, the PARRY program follows through a script-like schema (Schank and Abelson, 1977) in which memories of prior emotional responses are stored.

Reference-contexts: For instance, an anomalous monist <ref> (Davidson, 1973) </ref> could argue that even if we had a detailed understanding of the way the brain operates when dealing with emotional events this would not constitute knowledge of emotion. This is because emotional events are supervenient on the physical, at the individual event level.

Reference-contexts: Neuroscience still has a lot of work to do in this area: `the interaction of neural and humoral feedback to the brain is indeed complex' <ref> (LeDoux, 1986, p 323) </ref>. Within neuroscience LeDoux (1986) reports that it is accepted `as a matter of fact that there are emotional centres ... found in what is now called the limbic system, the limbic system is often described as the emotional system of the brain' (p 327). <p> All of the work on emotions in neuroscience is underpinned by the assumption that `it is at least possible that "the mental" can be understood in terms of "the physical". Otherwise the pursuit of a cognitive neuroscience would be empty' <ref> (LeDoux, 1986, p 349) </ref>. This highlights the fact that the problem of subjective experience has been the enduring and troubling barrier to a unified theory of consciousness within the materialist tradition.

Reference-contexts: The system performs a match between input sentences and schematic structures and produces the appropriate response as given by the schema. Apart from the obvious criticism that Searle has identified problems for such a simplistic computational account of mental processes <ref> (Searle, 1984) </ref>, we can also ask what evidence there is to suggest that humans use this type of schematic processing for their emotional expression. Beck and Clark (1988) published a cognitive theory for depressive disorders which involved maladaptive schemas.
