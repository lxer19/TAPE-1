Abstract: Report SYCON-93-09 Recent Results on Lyapunov-theoretic Techniques for Nonlinear Stability ABSTRACT This paper presents a Converse Lyapunov Function Theorem motivated by robust control analysis and design. Our result is based upon, but generalizes, various aspects of well-known classical theorems. In a unified and natural manner, it (1) includes arbitrary bounded disturbances acting on the system, (2) deals with global asymptotic stability, (3) results in smooth (infinitely differentiable) Lyapunov functions, and (4) applies to stability with respect to not necessarily compact invariant sets. As a corollary of the obtained Converse Theorem, we show that the well-known Lyapunov sufficient condition for "input-to-state stability" is also necessary, settling positively an open question raised by several authors during the past few years.

Reference-contexts: In the particular case in which the set D consists of just one point, the above definition reduces to the standard notion of set asymptotic stability of differential equations. (Note, however, that this definition differs from those in <ref> [3] </ref>, and [30], which are not global.) If, in addition, A consists of just an equilibrium point x 0 , this is the usual notion of global asymptotic stability for the solution x (t) x 0 . <p> As explained earlier, our proof is modeled along the lines of that paper. See also the textbooks [31] and [11] for many of these classical results. Nondifferentiable Lyapunov functions have been studied in many papers and textbooks. Among these we may mention the classic book <ref> [3] </ref> by Bhatia and Szego, as well as Zubov's work (see for instance [32]) which study in detail continuous Lyapunov function characterizations for global asymptotic stability with respect to arbitrary closed invariant sets.

(Such a function always exists since any closed subset of Euclidean space can be described as the zero set of a smooth function; see for instance <ref> [6] </ref>. Now consider the system _x = x y + xa (x; y)d; Note that the system is smooth everywhere. Let D = IR, and let A be the origin.

One of the central tools used in [21] and the follow-up papers has always been the fact that a system is input/state stable if it admits an "ISS-Lyapunov function." This motivates checking the ISS property by investigating ISS-Lyapunov functions for the given system.

Reference-contexts: Smooth Lyapunov functions, as opposed to merely continuous or once-differentiable, are required in order to apply "backstepping" techniques in which a feedback law is built by successively taking directional derivatives of feedback laws obtained for a simplified system. (See for instance <ref> [10] </ref> for more on backstepping design.) Finally, the effect of disturbances, and the study of associated Lyapunov functions, are topics of interest in robust control theory. In practice, control systems are very often affected by noise, expressed for instance as perturbations on controls and errors on observations.

Reference-contexts: These notions are closely related to the topic of stability under perturbations (total stability), studied in the classical dynamical systems literature. In the late 1980s, one of the coauthors introduced a particular precise definition of input/state stability, and established a few basic results; see for instance <ref> [21] </ref>, [23], and [22]. These results then were applied in different areas, including observer design and new small-gain theorems; see for instance [25], [27], [7], and [19].

One of the central tools used in [21] and the follow-up papers has always been the fact that a system is input/state stable if it admits an "ISS-Lyapunov function." This motivates checking the ISS property by investigating ISS-Lyapunov functions for the given system. <p> Equivalent characterizations of stability by means of decay estimates have proved very useful in control theory -see e.g. <ref> [21] </ref>- and this is the subject of Section 3. Some technical facts about Lyapunov functions, including a result on the smoothing of such functions around an attracting set, are given in Section 4. After this, Section 5 establishes some basic facts about complete systems needed for the main result. <p> The definition is intended as a nonlinear generalization of the bound jx (t)j j~j e fft + ckuk which holds for linear systems _x = Ax + Bu when the matrix A is asymptotically stable. Using this definition, it was proved in <ref> [21] </ref> and [23] that a system can be stabilized by a smooth feedback if and only if it is feedback equivalent to an ISS system. Thus the definition appears to be natural, and the further characterizations given later confirm this fact. <p> Finally, observe that Equation (57) states that the derivative _ V along trajectories is negative definite for large enough x, given any control magnitude. In <ref> [21] </ref> as well as in the literature since the publication of that paper, the fact that a system is ISS has always been established by showing that there is an ISS-Lyapunov function. <p> Let ~ fi = 2fi; ~fl = 2~fl. Then jx (t; ~; u)j max ~ fi (j~j ; t); ~fl (kuk) ; for all ~ 2 IR n , all inputs u, and all t 0. The next lemma relates ISS to the "input/output stability" property introduced in <ref> [21] </ref>: Lemma 11.6 A system (54) is ISS if and only if there exist KL functions fi 0 ; fi 1 and a K function fl such that, for any ~ 2 IR n and any input u, it holds that jx (t; ~; u)j fi 0 (j~j ; t) + <p> It is weakly robustly stable.

Section 7 deals with the compact case, essentially by reparameterization of trajectories. An example, motivated by related work of Tsinias and Kalouptsidis, is given in Section 8 to show that the analogous theorems are false for unbounded disturbances. <p> In the particular case in which the set D consists of just one point, the above definition reduces to the standard notion of set asymptotic stability of differential equations.
