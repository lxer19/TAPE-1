Abstract: In translingual information retrieval (TIR), ad hoc queries in any of a set of languages can be used to retrieve documents in any of a set of languages. Classical information-retrieval methods such as the vector-space model cannot be applied to TIR because they base similarity on the overlap of terms between queries and documents| this is typically zero in TIR. The generalized vector-space model (GVSM) and latent semantic indexing (LSI) are two variations of the vector-space model that make comparisons outside of term space. For this reason, both can be and have been applied to TIR. In this paper, we report on a series of experiments comparing the performance of GVSM and LSI on monolingual and translingual retrieval tasks. We find that the performance of both methods depends crucially on parameter settings, that LSI performs better, and that GVSM runs more quickly.

Reference-contexts: In fact, the LSI comparison uses r = 0, i.e., no multiples of the singular values are included. The reason for this error is simple: comparisons in LSI are often described in terms of the creation of "pseudo-documents" <ref> (Deerwester et al. 1990) </ref>, which involve multiplication by 1 . However, comparisons between pseudo-documents include a factor of , which cancels out the 1 . This second point is not made clearly by Berry, Dumais, & O'Brien (1995), and in some other LSI papers.

The mate-retrieval task is simple because it only requires a document-aligned testing corpus; no queries and relevance judgments are needed. However, it is not very closely related to realistic applications, so its overall usefulness is somewhat in doubt. The mate-retrieval task is defined as follows.
