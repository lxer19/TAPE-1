Abstract: Current radiosity methods rely on the calculation of geometric factors, known as form-factors which describe energy exchange between the surfaces of an environment. The most widely used method for storing the illumination across a surface is a mesh of quadrilaterals and/or triangles. For more exact computations these meshes need to be subdivided adaptively. The subdivision methods create artifacts which have visible results. A new technique for storing the surface is presented, based on Voronoi diagrams, which are well suited for the task, and can be subdivided without introducing Radiosity has become a popular method for image synthesis due to its ability to generate images of high realism. It was first introduced to computer graphics by Goral et al. [8]. Further research resulted in the progressive refinement method which is able to produce good approximations of the final solution very quickly [5]. The radiosity method was extended to include specular reflection through the so called two-pass approach. For recent developements see [11], [15], [16]. The geometric form-factors were first calculated by the use of a hemicube [6]. A hemicube is placed around the center of a patch and all other patches are projected onto its surfaces. The projected area gives an estimate for the geometric form-factor between the patches. This method, although very efficient because it can be done in hardware, has two major shortcomings. First, serious inaccuracies can occur if the size of the patch is large relative to the distance between patches. Second, a number of aliasing problems may occur. Other methods for computing the form-factors were suggested and/or implemented. Baum used a hybrid method involving both numerical and analytic methods [3] and other methods use ray-tracing to compute the form-factors [19], [15], [11], [17]. Wallace subdivides the shooting patch until an analytic solution to approximate the form-factor of the delta-areas can be used. Then the form-factors for all visible delta-areas are summed up giving a good approximation to the form-factor of the shooting patch. To reduce the computational expense without sacrificing image quality, a widely used two-level adaptive subdivision approach has been formulated by Cohen et al. [7]. The surface is subdivided into patches and these are used to compute a coarse solution for the global illumination. Then the patches are further subdivived into elements. The elements act as receivers of the light coming from the coarse patch solution, and provide the sample values for the final rendering process. artifacts.

The plane is subdivided into polygons where each polygon contains all points nearest to a given site (see Fig. 1.1).

Reference-contexts: Also it is difficult to calculate the correct area for the sampling points, especially for points lying on the common border of neighbouring polygons, when their subdivision level is different.

If we use a different type of mesh we can eliminate these problems. In the following we assume that we can assign a two dimensional coordinate system to each surface. <p> Wallace's method of computing the form-factors with raytracing [19] will therefore yield better results as his method approximates the shooting patch by a disk. Note that the Delauny triangulation of the sampling sites (Fig. 1.4) produces almost the same results as Baum's mesh elements <ref> [2] </ref>. This method was implemented using the Delauny triangulation as the internal representation. Initial experiments showed that the shading of the mesh shown in Fig. 1.4 produced undesireable artifacts along the shadow edge (Fig. 1.5, top).

Reference-contexts: This holds especially if we subdivide regularly (e.g. in a quadtree like manner) and disregard the direction of the discontinuity. Recently there has been a lot of research on how to represent these discontinuities in the mesh <ref> [4] </ref>. In some situations the opposite problem can occur, that is, shading discontinuities appear where they don't belong. This can happen when smooth surfaces in the environment are actually represented by a collection of independent polygons in the model. <p> This could be used to produce even better meshes. * If we use a constrained Voronoi diagram [14] it is possible to insert edges directly into the Voronoi diagram. This could be used to represent shadow edges on the surfaces directly <ref> [4] </ref>.
