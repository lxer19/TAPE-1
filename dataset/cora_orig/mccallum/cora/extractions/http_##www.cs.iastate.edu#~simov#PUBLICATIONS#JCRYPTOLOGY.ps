Abstract: In this paper we are interested in the resources required by a test to distinguish between a function collection and a collection of truly random functions. We define the level of interactiveness of a test for function collections as the number of rounds of queries it asks about the values of a function from the collection. We introduce a hierarchy of function collections, parameterized by the number of rounds required by some test to break them. We show that if there exists a one-way function, the hierarchy is proper.

Reference-contexts: Pseudorandom functions enable the following paradigm for designing cryptographic protocols, as explained in <ref> [1] </ref>. First design a cryptographic protocol which uses truly random functions. Prove that the protocol is secure. Now replace the protocol with one which uses a pseudorandom function in place of the truly random one.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The notion of a poly-random function collection is an important one in cryptography. It was first introduced by Goldreich, Goldwasser and Micali <ref> [3] </ref> as part of the constructive theory of randomness for functions. <p> The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly restates the main results in <ref> [3] </ref>: the definition of a poly-random function collection and the criterion for its existence. In Section 3 we introduce the definitions of deterministic and randomized classes of poly-random function collections parametrized by the number of query rounds required to break them. <p> As a corollary, in Section 5 we show that there does not exist a universal test for poly-random function collections. Section 6 contains the conclusions and suggestions for future work. 2 Function Collections: Notation and Preliminaries We use the following standard notation, similar to the one used in <ref> [3] </ref>. We denote the set of all natural numbers by N (0 2 N). The set of all positive integers is Z + . <p> The symbols and are used to denote "subset" and "proper subset" respectively. The following definitions, given by Goldreich, Goldwasser and Micali in <ref> [3] </ref>, develop the basic concept of poly-random function collections. Definition 2.1 ([3]) F = fF k j k 2 Z + g is a function collection if and only if, for all k, F k is a multiset with elements from H k , and F has the following properties: * <p> Function collections in D r -F C (respectively, R r -F C, D-F C, R-F C) are said to be D r -secure (respectively, R r -secure, D-secure, R-secure). R-F C coincides with the set of all poly-random function collections defined in <ref> [3] </ref>. The main result in [3] is that if there exists a one-way function, then R-F C 6= ;. In addition, a particular G 2 R-F C is constructed. There are several immediate observations about the classes of function collections that we have defined. <p> Function collections in D r -F C (respectively, R r -F C, D-F C, R-F C) are said to be D r -secure (respectively, R r -secure, D-secure, R-secure). R-F C coincides with the set of all poly-random function collections defined in <ref> [3] </ref>. The main result in [3] is that if there exists a one-way function, then R-F C 6= ;. In addition, a particular G 2 R-F C is constructed. There are several immediate observations about the classes of function collections that we have defined. <p> Indeed, we let G = fG k j k 2 Z + g be in R-F C, where G k = fg x 2 H k j x 2 I k g, e.g., the one defined in <ref> [3] </ref>. (Note, however, that in [3] the function collection which was proven to pass all R-tests was denoted as F . <p> Indeed, we let G = fG k j k 2 Z + g be in R-F C, where G k = fg x 2 H k j x 2 I k g, e.g., the one defined in <ref> [3] </ref>.
