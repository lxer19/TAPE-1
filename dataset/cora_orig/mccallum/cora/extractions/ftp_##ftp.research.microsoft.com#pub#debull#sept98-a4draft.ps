Reference-contexts: An example of an implementation-free table function is a generic OLEDB consumer that retrieves data from a variety of OLEDB providers that expose their data in the form of OLEDB rowsets. 3.2 Extenders Extenders provide a way for the DB2 database engine to interoperate with other search engines <ref> [DM97] </ref>. Using extenders, DB2's engine can learn about a new type of data which it may access with help from an internal or external search engine. Extender data may be stored in the database itself; if the search engine is external, it essentially acts as an external index.

Reference-contexts: This allows us to meet our extensibility and evolvability goals while still providing the optimizer with enough information to be effective <ref> [HKWY97, HKWY96] </ref>. Default code is provided for each of the wrapper interfaces, so wrapper writers only need to refine appropriate portions of the default code to expose the functions he or she wishes to provide.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we cover three complementary approaches that provide varying amounts of functionality, transparency, and performance. 3.1 Table Functions A table function is a user-defined function (UDF) that returns a collection type such as a table. Table functions were first introduced in Starburst <ref> [LLPS91] </ref> as a convenient way to import data from outside the database and present it as a virtual table without having to first store the data within the database. Products such as IBM's DB2 Universal Database have extensively enriched this concept.

Reference-contexts: Thus, in addition to providing seamless access to a multitude of (mostly relational) databases, the IBM DB2 UDB family offers several ways to provide access to more exotic data sources <ref> [RP98] </ref>. In this section, we cover three complementary approaches that provide varying amounts of functionality, transparency, and performance. 3.1 Table Functions A table function is a user-defined function (UDF) that returns a collection type such as a table.
