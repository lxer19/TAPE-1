Abstract: List navigation devices such as scrollbars provide a simple way to browse and find items in a list, but they typically do not communicate information about individual list entries. This paper presents two alternative devices, a mural bar and a pile bar, which encode information about each entry into the trough of the bar. Results from an experiment suggest that these new devices lead to improved user performance on typical list-based tasks.

Reference-contexts: Categories or classifications of the entries could be shown using the color, size, or offset of the line. A number of systems use this type of graphical representation to communicate information. Data visualization sliders provide a scrollbar-like interface for specifying numeric values <ref> [2] </ref>. The space inside the sliders contains a color-coded barplot or density plot representing the range of numeric values. Fisheye views, originally described in [3], have been adapted to text interface devices in systems such as [5].

Reference-contexts: This paper describes two navigation bars that use the line-based list representation: the mural bar and the pile bar. The mural bar uses an information mural <ref> [4] </ref> to communicate list entry properties, while the pile bar employs a pile metaphor [9] to arrange the encodings. <p> However, if there are a large number of highlighted entries, certain entries can be completely obscured. Mural Bars Information murals, compressed graphical displays of an information space, have been used in a wide range of applications, including visualizations of software execution, numerical data, and general information <ref> [4] </ref>. Information murals represent a large information space (in this case a textual list) with a smaller graphical space by mapping the elements in the large space into the smaller one.

Reference-contexts: This makes it easier to find messages from a particular person. Navigation bars were also added to Irwin, an information monitoring and display system <ref> [7] </ref>. Irwin is often used to monitor wire news articles available on the World Wide Web and create clusters of related articles. The navigation bar is used to highlight the most closely related clusters.

Reference-contexts: that more items are visible, structured lists such as directory listings, where the offset of lines has meaning, would not work as well with this display. 5 IMPLEMENTATION AND USE OF NAVIGATION BARS To test our ideas we implemented a navigation bar widget as an extension to the Tcl/Tk toolkit <ref> [8] </ref>. The widget can display either an information mural or a pile view in a scrollbar trough. The command set of a navigation bar is a superset of the commands for a Tcl/Tk scrollbar, so programmers can use navigation bars in situations where scrollbars typically would be employed.

Reference-contexts: This paper describes two navigation bars that use the line-based list representation: the mural bar and the pile bar. The mural bar uses an information mural [4] to communicate list entry properties, while the pile bar employs a pile metaphor <ref> [9] </ref> to arrange the encodings. We expect that these navigation bars will provide more information than a scrollbar about the contents of the list in a comparable amount of space, thus assisting the user in certain list browsing and accessing tasks. <p> Just as documents can be piled on a desk and identified by their appearance, items on the computer desktop can overlap and be recognized by their color, size, or shape. The pile metaphor was introduced in a desktop document layout system <ref> [9] </ref>. Piles created by the user had a disheveled appearance with parts of the document icon sticking out slightly so the user could find a document even if it were in the middle of the pile. The pile bar employs the pile metaphor in the arrangement of graphical bars.

Reference-contexts: Of course, the navigation bar widget contains additional commands that provide control over the color and layout of the bars. Navigation bars have been incorporated in a number of programs as a replacement for scrollbars. One such program is exmh, a graphical email reader <ref> [10] </ref>. Though exmh supports filtering and nested folders, lists of email messages can still become large and difficult to navigate. The navigation bar can highlight messages by sender name.
