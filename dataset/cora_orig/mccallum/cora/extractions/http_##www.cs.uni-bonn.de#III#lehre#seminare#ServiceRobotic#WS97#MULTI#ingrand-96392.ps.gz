Abstract: The Martha 1 project objectives are the control and the management of a fleet of autonomous mobile robots for transshipment tasks in harbours, airports and marshaling yards. Our presentation focuses on one of the most challenging and key problems of the Martha project: the multi robot cooperation. Indeed, high level missions are produced by a Central Station and sent to robots. It is then up to the robots to refine their missions, to plan their actions and trajectories in the environment and to coordinate these actions and trajectories with the other robots. In particular, these coordinations occur in crossings, in lanes when unexpected obstacles require the robot to move in the opposite lane, and in open areas where robots need to synchronise their trajectories. We present a general concept for the control of a large fleet of autonomous mobile robots which has been developed, implemented and validated in the framework of Martha.

Reference-contexts: We present in the sequel how this can be done. 3.3.1 Application to a fleet of mobile robots For the case of a number of mobile robots in a route network environment, we have devised a specific Plan-Merging Protocol based on spatial resource allocation (see <ref> [1] </ref>). It is an instance of the general protocol described above, but in this context, Plan-Merging Operation is done for a limited list of required spatial resources: a set of cells.

Reference-contexts: We will limit our analysis to contributions which involve an effective cooperation (at plan or program level) between several robots. Several approaches have been proposed, such as generation of trajectories without collision (e.g. [5, 19]), traffic rules [7, 10], negotiation for dynamic task allocation <ref> [13, 2] </ref>, and synchronisation by programming [17, 21]. Inter-robot communication allows to exchange various information, positions, current status, future actions, etc [2, 21, 20] and to devise effective cooperation schemes. <p> Several approaches have been proposed, such as generation of trajectories without collision (e.g. [5, 19]), traffic rules [7, 10], negotiation for dynamic task allocation [13, 2], and synchronisation by programming [17, 21].

Negotiation have been used for dynamic task <ref> [2] </ref> or resource [13] allocation to several robots on a situation-dependent basis. Most contributions which make use of synchronisation through communication are based on a pre-defined set of situations or on task dependent properties.

Reference-contexts: This procedure uses pre-existing landmarks present in the environment (buildings, furniture, . . . ). The geometry and the position of these landmarks are given to the robot. The localisation is based on a matching of segments extracted from acquired images with segments from the landmark models <ref> [3] </ref>. The obstacles modelling is directly the result of the segmentation of the acquired image. These obstacles are exported in the "perceived obstacles" poster to be used by the other modules.

Reference-contexts: The second module allows dynamical avoidance of unpredicted obstacles. The obstacles are detected with range sensors, such as ultra sonars or laser range finder. The avoidance consists in doing a deformation of the given trajectory under the influence of a potential field <ref> [11] </ref>. It is important to note that the trajectory should remain in a bounded area specified by the supervisor (the allocated cells or a corridor along the initial trajectory) in order not to interfere with the other robots. The failures, due to bulky obstacles, must be managed by the supervisor.

Reference-contexts: When other robots share common resources, the computed path avoids the last positions of these robots. The perceived obstacles are of course taken into account.

However, the term "cooperation" has been used in several contexts with different meanings. We will not consider here contributions to cooperation schemes at servo level (e.g. <ref> [14] </ref>) nor contributions which aim at building an "intelligent group" of simple robots (e.g. [15]). We will limit our analysis to contributions which involve an effective cooperation (at plan or program level) between several robots.

Reference-contexts: Whenever a robot elaborates a new plan, it has to validate it in the current multi robot context. This is done by collecting all the other robot plans and by "merging" its own plan with them. This operation is "protected" by a distributed mutual exclusion mechanism <ref> [16] </ref>, and is performed without modifying the other robots plans, to allow them to continue their current execution. However, the robot which does the plan-merging may ask the other robots to inform it of the occurrence of particular events, so that it can synchronise itself on them.

Reference-contexts: The Plan-Merging paradigm remains then applicable: the inserted plan will then concern several robots at a time. Again a PMO for several robots at a time, instead of one, may fail leading, in very intricate situations, to more and more aggregation until one reaches a completely centralised system (see <ref> [18] </ref> for a detailed discussion). At this point, if the last planning robot cannot find a solution, it means that the problem is infeasible. Here we must recall that we do not claim that the Plan-Merging paradigm can solve or help to solve multi-robot planning problems.
