Reference-contexts: Tests of a simple procedure of this type applied to the microcluster problem showed that this is the case and that order-of-magnitude improvements in efficiency can be obtained on low-dimensionality (number of atoms 100) problems <ref> [10] </ref>. Performance degraded with increasing dimensionality, possibly - 9 - because only isotropic averaging (i.e., fl a scalar) was used; the use of anisotropic averaging may overcome this difficulty. Effective energy simulated annealing has also been adapted into a build-up procedure which is more efficient for large dimensionality problems.

It is axiomatic that the solution of a global optimization problem, or multiple-minima problem, will be improved by any physical understanding of the problem which serves to restrict the search space, or domain, which contains the global solution. <p> Works along this line include [1, 13, 14, 15, 25, 26, 40, 49, 54, 55, 71, 78, 79, 80]. The support for this assumption comes primarily from numerical investigations <ref> [26, 49] </ref>. For the Lennard-Jones cluster, the lattice structures consist of an icosahedral core and particular combinations of surface lattice points. Given this physical insight into the problem, the approach outlined below begins with a discrete optimization algorithm applied to a relatively small sample of initial states.

For general global optimization algorithms, we refer readers to the two classical references <ref> [29] </ref> and [51]. 3.1 Lattice Based Search The difficulty of the Lennard-Jones cluster problem arises from the fact that it is a global optimization problem with an exponential number of local minima [26].

Reference-contexts: The third strategy of GA is that of mutation, meaning that genetic material is occasionally corrupted, leading to individuals who may or may not be more fit than they would have been otherwise, but always maintaining a certain level of genetic diversity in the population. In reference <ref> [30] </ref>, both SA and GA are implemented to compute the global minimizers of the Lennard-Jones cluster. Results show that both GA and SA perform progressively better relative to random search as the problem size increases, compared to the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm.

Reference-contexts: However, whether this kind of approach will lead to success in more complicated clusters and in protein folding is still not clear at this time. 3.2 Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms Simulated annealing (SA) is a general purpose optimization technique that has been proposed by Kirkpatrick et al. <ref> [31] </ref>. This method is an extension of a Monte Carlo method developed by Metropolis et al. [45], to determine the equilibrium states of a collection of atoms at any given temperature T . <p> This method is an extension of a Monte Carlo method developed by Metropolis et al. [45], to determine the equilibrium states of a collection of atoms at any given temperature T . Since the method was first proposed in <ref> [31, 32] </ref>, much research has been conducted on its use and properties. Besides its applications to other problems, SA has been widely used in the search of lower energy configurations of molecular clusters. <p> The global minimization problem can be viewed as that of interpolating from (8) to (9). Simulated annealing, in which the stochastic Metropolis algorithm is used to search the space with probability density p T (R) <ref> [31] </ref>, is one method for doing this; but it is too inefficient for the large dimensionality continuous problems posed by molecular structure prediction. A key to good performance is the identification and utilization of appropriate sizes for the stochastic jumps.

Reference-contexts: The method found the global minimum when applied to standard test cases for low dimensionality (n 10) (e.g., Goldstein-Price, Griewank, ...) <ref> [34] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For example, in the microcluster problem, the lowest energy state was obtained in 9 out of 14 cases investigated (where the number of atoms ranged from 5 to 55. Even when the global minimum was not found, relatively low-energy local minima were identified <ref> [35] </ref>. Performance of the method on small peptides was also tested using a typical protein model potential [36]. The method found the global minimum of a simplified model of dialanine restricted to 2 degrees of freedom. <p> This problem was addressed simply by replacing the Lennard-Jones potential with a truncated version that goes to a finite value as r ! 0 <ref> [35] </ref>. However, the effect of this procedure and sensitivity of the obtained solution to the truncation parameter is unknown.

Reference-contexts: The minimization of nonconvex potential energy functions arising from molecular conformation or protein folding problems has become one of the most important problems for interdisciplinary research <ref> [8, 57, 24] </ref>. It should be noted that this is a very hard problem. Current methods are limited by the problem size since, when the cluster size grows, the number of local minimizers often grows exponentially.

Reference-contexts: It should be possible to overcome these problems by replacing H (R) in boundary conditions (5) with the exponentially transformed form exp [fiH (R)]. The utility of this procedure is being investigated (H. Scheraga, personal communication). 3.3.2 Effective Energy Methods This class of methods <ref> [61, 62] </ref> is motivated by considering the physical process of thermally annealing a molecular structure from high temperature, where it is largely disordered, down to a low temperature T lo , where the conformation fluctuates in a narrow range about the - 7 - global minimizer. <p> Intuitively, we guess that these scales corresponds to the magnitudes of the thermal fluctuations experienced by a physical system at temperature T . Different size scales fl ff (T ) may be needed in different regions. 3.3.3 Packet Annealing The packet-annealing method <ref> [61] </ref> is designed to focus attention on the appropriate temperature-dependent size scales in a systematic manner. <p> However, since it only contributes an R-independent constant to ~ H fl ff ;T (R), in practice it can be ignored.

Use of the full method, incorporating packet branching, might improve performance, but this has not yet been tested. 3.3.4 Effective Energy Simulated Annealing ~ H fl ff ;T can be used directly in stochastic simulated annealing methods.
