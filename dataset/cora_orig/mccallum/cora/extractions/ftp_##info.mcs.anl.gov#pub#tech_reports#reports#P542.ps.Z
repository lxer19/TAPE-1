Reference-contexts: Given the smooth function hf i , we use continuation on to trace the minimizers of hf i back to the original function. In this paper we unify and extend the work of Wu [31] and More and Wu <ref> [18, 19] </ref> on using the Gaussian transform hf i for smoothing. Our results in Sections 2 and 3 show that the Gaussian transform can be viewed as a special case of a generalized transform and that these generalized transforms share many of the properties of the Gaussian transform. <p> Theorem 3.2 was stated informally by Wu [31] for the Gaussian density function; a formal proof under assumption (3.3) appears in More and Wu <ref> [18] </ref>. The proof for the generalized transform follows the arguments used by More and Wu [18]; the only tricky part in the proof is to show that assumption (3.3) guarantees that we can differentiate under the integral sign. <p> Theorem 3.2 was stated informally by Wu [31] for the Gaussian density function; a formal proof under assumption (3.3) appears in More and Wu <ref> [18] </ref>. The proof for the generalized transform follows the arguments used by More and Wu [18]; the only tricky part in the proof is to show that assumption (3.3) guarantees that we can differentiate under the integral sign. Theorem 3.2 is of interest from a computational viewpoint because optimization algorithms require the gradient and Hessian of hhf ii . <p> This class of functions was introduced by Wu [31] under the term generalized multilinear functions; More and Wu <ref> [18] </ref> introduced the term decomposable to avoid confusion with the use of multilinear for a function that is linear in each argument. Decomposable functions form an algebra, that is, a vector space that is closed under multiplication. Linear and quadratic functions in IR n are decomposable.
