Abstract: We consider the problem of coordinating access to the various channels of a single-hop WDM network. We present HiPeR-`, a high performance reservation protocol specifically designed to overcome the potential inefficiencies of operating in environments with non-negligible processing, tuning, and propagation delays. HiPeR-` differs from previous reservation protocols in that each control packet makes reservations for all data packets waiting in a node's queues, thus significantly reducing control overhead. Packets are scheduled for transmission using algorithms that can effectively mask the tuning times. HiPeR-` also uses pipelining to mask processing times and propagation delays; parameter ` of the protocol is used to control the degree of pipelining. We use Markov chain theory to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the protocol. The stability condition provides insight into the factors affecting the operation of the protocol, such as the degree of load balancing across the various channels, and the quality of the scheduling algorithms. The analysis is fairly general, as it holds for MMBP-like arrival processes with any number of states, and for non-uniform destinations.

Reference-contexts: As described, the protocol is said to have a look-ahead ` = 1, since control information transmitted during the k-th frame is used to construct the (k + 1)-th frame; thus the name HiPeR-1. This protocol falls into the class of gated reservation schemes <ref> [3] </ref>, since only those packets that arrived prior to the beginning of frame k will be transmitted in frame k + 1. The difference between HiPeR-` and traditional reservation protocols (including FatMAC [19]) is that HiPeR-` does not have a distinct reservation phase. <p> Proof.

Reference-contexts: This is a Bernoulli process whose arrival rate varies according to a two-state Markov chain. (For details on the properties of the 2-MMBP, the reader is referred to <ref> [14] </ref>.) We note that all of our results can be readily extended to MMBPs with more than two states. <p> Obviously, q (k0) (k1) i = 1; k = 0; 1. Also, ff (0) (1) arrival rates of the Bernoulli process at states 0 and 1, respectively. The arrival process to each node i is given by a different 2-MMBP, independent of the arrival processes to other nodes. From <ref> [14] </ref> we obtain the average arrival rate fl i of the i-th 2-MMBP as: fl i = (10) (0) (01) (1) q i + q i fl i is the probability that any slot contains a packet, regardless of the state of the 2-MMBP. <p> The total arrival rate to each network is fl = 7:344. In Figure 6 we show the squared coefficient of variation of the interarrival time obtained in <ref> [14] </ref>. As we can see, the arrival processes were selected so that the two parameters take a wide range of values. Based on the results of the previous section, we have assigned receive wavelengths to the various nodes so as to spread the traffic evenly across the channels.

Reference-contexts: The novelty of HiPeR-` lies in the fact that, by transmitting a single control packet, nodes can make reservations for multiple data packets. Thus, control overhead is significantly reduced, and nodes can use scheduling algorithms that can effectively mask tuning times <ref> [17] </ref>.

Doing so makes it possible to overlap the tuning latency at a node with packet transmissions from other nodes. The main result of <ref> [17] </ref> was a set of new algorithms for constructing near-optimal (and, under certain conditions, optimal) schedules for transmitting a set of traffic demands fa ic g. Quantity a ic represents the number of packets to be transmitted by node i onto channel c . <p> The schedules are such that no collisions ever occur. They are also easy to implement in a high speed environment, since the order in which the various nodes transmit is the same for all channels <ref> [17] </ref>. assigned a ic contiguous slots for transmitting packets on that channel. These a ic slots are followed by a gap of g ic 0 slots during which no node may transmit on c . <p> This gap may be necessary to ensure that node i + 1 has sufficient time to tune from wavelength c1 before starting transmission on c . However, the algorithms in <ref> [17] </ref> are such that the number of slots in most of the gaps is equal to either zero or a small integer. Thus, the length of the schedule is very close to the lower bound. The scheduling algorithms in [17] require complete information about the traffic demands fa ic g. <p> However, the algorithms in <ref> [17] </ref> are such that the number of slots in most of the gaps is equal to either zero or a small integer. Thus, the length of the schedule is very close to the lower bound. The scheduling algorithms in [17] require complete information about the traffic demands fa ic g. HiPeR-` is a reservation protocol used by the network nodes to dynamically share this information. 3.3 Traffic Model The performance analysis of protocols for WDM networks has been typically carried out assuming uniform traffic and Poisson arrivals. <p> are source node dependent and non-uniformly distributed. 4 Description of the HiPeR-` Protocol The operation of HiPeR-` is rather simple: * Each network node periodically sends control packets informing all other nodes about its traffic demands. 6 * Each node has a copy of the packet scheduling algorithm developed in <ref> [17] </ref>. Upon receipt of all control packets transmitted by other nodes, each node independently runs the algorithm to determine at what time slots to transmit its own data packets. There are two main differences between HiPeR-` and any of the protocols that have appeared in the literature. <p> Assume that, somehow, each node i has made reservations for a (k) ic data packets on wavelength c , and that these reservations are known to all nodes. Each node independently runs the scheduling algorithm in <ref> [17] </ref> to compute a packet transmission schedule. However, the input to this algorithm is not quantities fa (k) ic g, but rather quantities fa (k) ic + 1g; the extra slot is for transmitting a control packet (more on this shortly). <p> In effect, the value of a ic in a control packet transmitted in frame k + 1 represents the number of packets that arrived to the 1 One important aspect of the scheduling algorithms in <ref> [17] </ref> is that their running time depends only on system parameters such as the number of nodes and channels, not on the actual frame length. 8 c-th queue of node i between time t k (the beginning of transmission of frame k) and time t k+1 (the beginning of transmission of

There, the generating functions of the queue size and of the delay distribution are derived for fairly general arrival processes. The model in [18] assumes a fixed TDMA frame size, with each node receiving a fixed number of slots occupying the same positions in every frame. In HiPeR-`, however, each node will make reservations for a different number of slots from frame to frame. Consequently, the frame size will vary. <p> Consequently, the frame size will vary. Furthermore, the scheduling algorithm is run anew for each frame, therefore, the order in which the various nodes transmit may be different in consecutive frames. As a result, the analysis in <ref> [18] </ref> is not applicable here. For the same reasons, an exact delay analysis of a system running HiPeR-` appears to be difficult. We note, however, that packet delay is directly related to the frame size.

Reference-contexts: But these packets are scheduled independently of each other, thus a tuning overhead is incurred for each. DQMW also has higher processing requirements than other protocols, since two control packets must be sent for each data packet. FatMAC <ref> [19] </ref> is a reservation protocol that does not require a separate control channel. Instead, all channels operate in cycles, with each cycle consisting of a control and data phase. Reservations are transmitted in the control phase, and the corresponding data packets are sent in the following data phase. <p> Secondly, control packets are not transmitted over a separate channel. Reservations are in-band over the same channels used for data. Furthermore, time in the channels is not divided into distinct reservation and data phases as in FatMAC <ref> [19] </ref>. Exactly when control packets are transmitted will be discussed shortly. The next subsection describes a first version of HiPeR-`. <p> This protocol falls into the class of gated reservation schemes [3], since only those packets that arrived prior to the beginning of frame k will be transmitted in frame k + 1. The difference between HiPeR-` and traditional reservation protocols (including FatMAC <ref> [19] </ref>) is that HiPeR-` does not have a distinct reservation phase. Instead, control packets are transmitted within a frame along with data packets. This is necessary in order to minimize the tuning overhead.

Then, they process the information in the control slot to determine if a data slot has been reserved for them.

Reference-contexts: In Section 6 we present some numerical results, and we conclude the paper in Section 7. 2 Why A New Media Access Control Protocol? Access to the various channels of a single-hop network is usually based on reservation schemes that require the use of control channels <ref> [5, 6, 8, 11, 10, 21] </ref>. Existing protocols require that control 1 information be transmitted on the control channel for each packet sent on the data channels. <p> Its main drawback, however, is lack of scalability, as it requires N +k wavelengths. In fact, almost all control channel protocols require a number of wavelengths at least equal to the number of nodes N . The MaTPi protocol <ref> [21] </ref> uses pipelining to mask the effect of tuning times. The PROTON protocol [11] can operate with any number of wavelengths, and its design explicitly considers tuning and processing times.
