Abstract: We describe a system for extracting concepts from unstructured text. We do this by identifying relationships between words in the text based on a lexical database and identifying groups of these words which form closely tied conceptual groups. The word relationships are used to create a directed graph, called a Semantic Relationship Graph (SRG). This SRG is a robust representation of the relationships between word senses which can be used to identify the individual concepts which occur in the text. We demonstrate the usefulness of this technique in several applications.

Reference-contexts: One approach for effectively mining relevant information from raw text is based on finding common "themes" or "concepts" in a given document. The Information Retrieval is mainly concerned with the specific problem of search <ref> [4] </ref>, we are primarily interested in concept identification, which can in turn be applied to a number of specific problems, including search.

Reference-contexts: WordNet contains information about a number of different types of relationships between words. Currently, we only use sub- and super-class relationships for most common nouns and verbs, but are be able to expand to use other types of relationships found in WordNet <ref> [5] </ref>. Sub- and super-class relationships are a natural way of relating concepts, and provide for much greater flexibility than a dictionary or synonym-based thesaurus, thus providing us with a solid basis for testing and evaluating our system.

Reference-contexts: A hierarchical tree approach to this problem, for example, has exactly this weak point; the tree branching is too dependent on the completeness of the knowledge base. 3.2 Example SRGs Consider the following paragraph, taken from an undergraduate history text <ref> [6] </ref>: Another problem was to make governments strong enough to prevent internal disorder. In pursuit of this goal, however, rulers were frustrated by one of the strongest movements of the eleventh and twelfth centuries: the drive to reform the Church.

Reference-contexts: Applications to World Wide Web searching, document summarization, email sorting, or any other application where search and extraction of concepts are more meaningful than mere keywords. To illustrate this in more detail, consider an example web-based classification problem <ref> [7] </ref>: given a set of pre-classified training pages, be able to identify a given web page as either a student page, faculty page, or `other'. We can design the system as follows: for the training data, create separate SRGs for the student and faculty classes.
