Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Since early versions of GPSG <ref> (Gazdar et al. 1985) </ref>, the separation of phrase structure grammar into immediate dominance (ID) and linear precedence (LP) information has found widespread acceptance in monostratal theories of grammar such as HPSG (Pollard & Sag 1987; Pollard & Sag 1994).

Reference-contexts: sharing is exemplified by (2), which requires a head constituent to be ordered after its subject. (2) synsem 1 i h synsemjsubj h 1 i i The motivation for such constraints will be explained in the next section. 2 Linearization in HPSG In what follows we adopt (word) order domains <ref> (Reape 1993) </ref> as a linear representation over which LP constraints operate. This allows a more flexible way of deriving linear order from constituent structure than in standard HPSG, which is totally phrase structure-based.

Reference-contexts: Thus, if the new domain consists of the union of the daughters' order domain elements (cf. Reape's sequence-union), we have the effect of "liberating" subconstituents <ref> (Zwicky 1986) </ref>. Alternatively, if each daughter uniformly contributes a single domain element to the mother domain, the result will not allow any discontinuities and hence be equivalent to GPSG's ID/LP format.
