Abstract: This paper presents a novel concept of multi-drop path-based multidestination message passing on switch-based irregular networks. First, the multi-drop mechanism is defined with an associated header encoding scheme, and this mechanism is used to develop path-based multidestination worms. Next, a method is proposed to identify valid multidestination paths on arbitrary irregular networks with a typical deadlock-free routing. Then, the deadlock-free property of multi-drop path-based worms is emphasized. Using the above concepts, three mul-ticast algorithms are proposed: multi-drop path-based greedy (MDP-G), multi-drop path-based less-greedy (MDP-LG), and multi-drop path-based binomial (MDP-B). The proposed algorithms are compared with each other and with the best unicast based algorithm, the CCO [5], for a range of system and technological parameters. The MDP-LG scheme is shown to be the best to implement multicast with reduced latency.

Reference-contexts: The final destination absorbs the complete worm. 3.2 Tree-based Multidestination Worms The above path-based multidestination mechanism (with a header of destination ids) cannot be directly applied to switch-based networks because there is no one-to-one correspondence between switches/routers and processors on such networks. Thus, a tree-based mechanism <ref> [3, 9, 14, 16] </ref> has been proposed which allows a multidestination worm to replicate at switches with multiple replicas of the worm following different paths in the network. In this approach, the switches possess the capability to replicate flits of an arriving multidestination worm to multiple output ports.

Reference-contexts: These algorithms are evaluated over a range of system parameters and compared with the best unicast-based multi-cast algorithm, the CCO algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. The MDP-LG algorithm shows benefits of 50%, 40%, and 20% for multicast latency when compared to the CCO, MDP-G, MDP-B algorithms, respectively. These results clearly demonstrate that the multi-drop path-based multidestination mechanism promises significant potential to implement fast and efficient collective communication operations in future switch-based irregular systems. <p> Therefore, generating a valid multi-drop multidestination path for a worm w on an arbitrary switch-based irregular network N is equivalent to generating a valid path which covers the switches in L sw (w), in that order, on the interconnection graph G of that network. In our recent work <ref> [5] </ref>, we have defined the concept of a partial ordered chain (POC) with the specific purpose of constructing an ordering among switches in an irregular network to reduce link contention between two messages of the same multicast using unicast message passing. <p> list of switches &lt; s 1 ; s 2 ; : : : ; s n &gt;, where s i is connected to s i+1 by a "down" tree link (from the BFS spanning tree) or a "down" cross link connecting switches at different levels of the BFS spanning tree <ref> [5] </ref>. It can be easily observed that the path of a multi-drop multidestination worm can possibly lie on some POC. Since up*/down* routing is deadlock-free, such multi-drop multidestination worms can also implement deadlock-free multicast. <p> All these algorithms use the POC concept to construct as many longest POCs as possible from the participating switches and group these POCs in some hierarchy to implement multicast. Let us first look at how the POCs are constructed. 6.1 Construction of POCs In <ref> [5] </ref>, we described a method to construct as many longest POCs as possible from the participating switches of a multicast. We explain the method using an example multicast. Interested readers can refer to [5] for details. graph and let the processors on the switch numbered i be labelled as p i;1 <p> Let us first look at how the POCs are constructed. 6.1 Construction of POCs In <ref> [5] </ref>, we described a method to construct as many longest POCs as possible from the participating switches of a multicast.

Let us consider a multicast with the source as p 10;1 and two destinations on each switch except switches 10 and 6. <p> In either case, information about the topology of the network is available to the communication layer, like in the IBM SP amd Myrinet. 7 Simulation Experiments and Results We performed simulation experiments to evaluate and compare performance of the MDP-G, MDP-LG, MDP-B, and CCO <ref> [5] </ref> algorithms for single multicast. A flit-level wormhole-routed simulator WORMULSim was used to model the irregular network. For all simulation experiments, we assumed system and technological parameters representing the current trend in technology. <p> For all experiments (unless otherwise stated) we assumed the following default system configuration: a 256 processor system interconnected by 64 eight-port switches and network having 75% connectivity, as defined in <ref> [5] </ref>. The default message length was assumed to be 128 flits. We performed several experiments to study the impact of system size, message length, communication start-up time, switch size, and degree of connectivity on single multicast latency for varying sizes of destination sets.

Reference-contexts: Due to lack of space, we are not able to present the proof of this Theorem here. Interested readers are requested to read <ref> [6] </ref> for the detailed proof. It must be noted that the concept of valid multi-drop multidestination worms using POCs on Autonet routing can also be extended to the case when the routing tables support non-minimal paths. <p> Due to lack of space, we are not able to present this proof here. Interested readers are requested to read <ref> [6] </ref> for the detailed proof. 6 Multicast Algorithms In this section we propose three multicast algorithms using the multi-drop path-based mechanism. All these algorithms use the POC concept to construct as many longest POCs as possible from the participating switches and group these POCs in some hierarchy to implement multicast. <p> Due to lack of space, we are not able to present the results of variation in switch size and connectivity. Similar benefits were observed by the multi-drop algorithms in these experiments too. Interested readers are requested to refer to <ref> [6] </ref> for these results. 8 Conclusions In this paper we have proposed a new multi-drop path-based multidestination message passing mechanism on switch-based irregular networks. A method to identify valid multi-drop paths with respect to a typical deadlock-free routing on arbitrary irregular networks has been proposed.

Reference-contexts: This mechanism allows a message to have exactly one destination. This leads to collective communication operations being implemented as multiple phases of unicast message exchange. In order to reduce the number of phases to implement collective communication operations, a Hamiltonian Path-based scheme was proposed on MPP networks <ref> [7] </ref>. This scheme uses a modified router organization to support propagation of multidestination messages (a message with multiple destinations) and allows a message to be consumed at a destination node while being forwarded to the next node concurrently. <p> Next, we discuss tree-based multi-destination worms on switch-based irregular networks and show the motivation for path-based multidestination worms on such networks. 3.1 Multidestination Message Passing and Path-based Worms The concept of wormhole message passing with multiple destinations was first introduced by Lin and Ni for <ref> [7] </ref> Hamiltonian meshes. Then, multidestination message passing was introduced [11] for k-ary n-cube networks with different base routing schemes. These schemes were proposed for regular direct networks typical of MPPs. In such networks each node consists of a router and a processor. <p> Such a mechanism allows easy construction of paths (of switches) in an irregular network. It simplifies handling of deadlock problems because a worm does not get replicated into several worms, branched over multiple paths. It also allows simplified header encoding by using a variation of the all-destination encoding <ref> [7, 11] </ref> where `destination' ids are replaced by `switch' ids and ids of `destinations connected to a switch'. Figure 3 (a) shows an example of a multi-drop path-based multidestination worm. <p> It also requires minimal modification to the switch and results in low complexity for creation of multidestination worms. Fig. 3. The Multi-drop mechanism: (a) example of a multidestination worm and (b) the header encoding. 4.2 The Multi-drop Header Encoding Scheme This new scheme is a hybrid of the all-destination <ref> [7, 11] </ref> and multiport [14] encoding schemes. It makes use of the fact that switches too have unique addresses in a typical switch-based irregular network like Autonet [13]. The current implementation of the Autonet switch can route messages addressed to a particular switch.

Four different message lengths - 128, 256, 512, and 1024 flits, on a 256 processor system with default parameters were considered. Figure 8 shows the respective results.
