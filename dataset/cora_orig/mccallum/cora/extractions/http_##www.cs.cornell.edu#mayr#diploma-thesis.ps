Reference-contexts: The idea was to realize a development environment on which some of the design techniques of the project Focus (see <ref> [BDD + 95] </ref>) could be based. There are already formalizations for that purpose, but none are using HOL and none are realizing mobility. This thesis can be seen as preparatory work for a future formalization of mobile networks in Isabelle 1 .

Reference-contexts: This thesis can be seen as preparatory work for a future formalization of mobile networks in Isabelle 1 . The second motivation stems from examinations of term algebras for mobile networks and their axiomatisation (compare <ref> [BS~95] </ref>). Some of the considerations about renaming, name abstractness, and the operators where guided by these algebraic goals. The last and most important inspiration was the search for a denotational model of the -calculus of Milner ([MPW92a],[MPW92b]).

Reference-contexts: Introduction 1.1 Motivation This thesis is based upon an article written by Radu Grosu and Ketil Sttlen <ref> [GS96] </ref>. They describe a denotational model for mobile networks whose components share channels. It models nondeterministic data-flow networks by sets of stream processing functions which are contractive with respect to the metric of streams. <p> We tried to make the theory apt to model synchronous communication as in the -calculus. This was realized through the synchronous operations, the name abstractness principle, the equivalence of components, and the concatenation operation. 1 Some sources implementing real numbers, metric spaces, and the original model of <ref> [GS96] </ref> are available. Please contact the author. 7 8 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 1.2 Survey of Contents The second chapter begins by defining the basics of networks: named message streams and contractive functions on such streams. <p> Due to the contractivity with respect to the complete metric space of streams, these functions, called behaviors, have unique fixed points according to Bannach's fixed point theorem (T.B.4). After that we define genericity, the correspondence to dynamic channel access rules. Here we use a different approach than <ref> [GS96] </ref>, based on an idea of Radu Grosu, privacy of channel names is no longer explicitly controlled by each component's genericity rules, rather it is guaranteed in an assumption/commitment style. Private channels are simply active channels which cannot be initially used by the other components. <p> The third chapter examines the operations on the defined components. Besides the operators which correspond to the ones given in <ref> [GS96] </ref> (in the context of our changed model), we introduce the union, which corresponds to the sum operator of the -calculus. Furthermore we define the concatenation of partial components, giving expression to our concept of time partiality in acordance to the prefix operator `.. <p> The biggest part of the chapter however, is devoted to the three main operators: feedback, parallel composition, and mutual feedback composition. All three are given in an asynchronous version, like the ones given in <ref> [GS96] </ref> and in a 2 Name abstractness however, does not include the possiblity of receiving an already active channel name. This case has to be included explicitly, which is a clear weakness of our model. 1.3. RESULTS 9 synchronous one. <p> Perhaps, name abstractness and renaming are first steps in this direction. While deepening our understanding of mobile networks and their denotational models, there were important results as by-products. For example, the composition of <ref> [GS96] </ref> is not associative. That was our main motivation for turning down the list representation in favor of multisets as representation for messages sent during a time unit on one channel. <p> BASIC DEFINITIONS Appendix B Metric Space Basics B.1 Metric Spaces This section was, because of its generality, simply taken from <ref> [GS96] </ref>. The fundamental concept in metric spaces is the concept of distance. Definition B.1 Metric Spaces .
