Abstract: Inherent in robot control and behavior is cyclicity. Sequences of actions taken by the robot tend to repeat. This is no more apparent than in the locomotion of hexapod robots. The movement of the separate legs must be coordinated in such a way that smooth forward motion will result. The individual legs each have their own cyclic nature and the combination of leg movements forms a cycle of over all movement. In primitive robots, with simple controllers that require a string of activations for locomotion, an appropriate cycle of these activations needs to be provided. The problem is further complicated by the robots uniqueness and accompanying variance of leg capabilities. In previous work we introduced Cyclic Genetic Algorithms which have successfully been used to generate gaits for actual hexapod robots. In this paper, we extend on that work by showing that the CGA can adapt to disabilities in the robot and adjust the gait accordingly.

This technique was successful for the robots used, which had relatively complex controllers.

Small inexpensive robots that require a repeatable sequence of activations for control need to be able to generate gaits using minimal a priori knowledge of tripod gaits.

Small inexpensive robots that require a repeatable sequence of activations for control need to be able to generate gaits using minimal a priori knowledge of tripod gaits. Graham Spencer <ref> [3] </ref> used genetic programming and minimal a priori knowledge to evolve programs that could produce gaits. Although the programs learned were capable of producing gaits with sustained forward movement, they did not result in the optimal tripod gait.

Reference-contexts: Although the programs learned were capable of producing gaits with sustained forward movement, they did not result in the optimal tripod gait. In addition, his tests were done only on simulations and not on an actual robot. In previous work, we developed <ref> [4] </ref> Cyclic Genetic Algorithms (CGAs), which generate gaits using minimal a priori knowledge. It has been shown that the use of CGAs can be an effective means of gait generation for hexapod robot simulations. They can, with only low-level primitives, produce reasonable gaits in minimal time. <p> An average rate per activation was calculated for horizontal and vertical movement by dividing the maximum throw by the minimum number of activations required to attain it. CYCLIC GENETIC ALGORITHMS Cyclic Genetic Algorithms <ref> [4] </ref> solve the problem of evolving repetitive behavior that requires continual cycles of sequential actions. They are based on Genetic Algorithms, which were introduced by John Holland [6], and use the standard selection, crossover and mutation operators.

Reference-contexts: Their output requires little in intermediate controller complexity, as it is a sequence of these primitives, which can be fed directly into the robot. In addition, the applicability of these algorithms has been tested on an actual robot <ref> [5] </ref>. A model for simulation was produced based on the measured capabilities of the ServoBot robot. This model was trained with the CGA and the evolved gaits were transferred to the actual semi-autonomous robot.

They are based on Genetic Algorithms, which were introduced by John Holland <ref> [6] </ref>, and use the standard selection, crossover and mutation operators. They differ in that the CGA chromosome has a cycle of genes that can accommodate the cyclic nature of gaits. In addition, the genes can represent tasks that must be completed in a predetermined segment of time.
