Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present a model of how systems can organ-ise into multi-celled communities based around the biological concept of mutualism (Boucher, 1985). The resulting model will be shown to be applicable to understanding phenomena in a variety of domains including economics, sociology, and other environments where simple units are subject to local and global forces. The paper questions the relevance of the Prisoners Dilemma in understanding the behaviour of these systems, and speculates that swarm-like models may actually comprise an equivalence class. It is suggested that a movement to models more like those traditionally defined in population biology may well provide fruitful insights into the construction of multiple adaptive systems.

Reference-contexts: Economic models of such processes have been developed using Cellular Automata <ref> (eg. Kirman, 1994, Darley, forthcomming) </ref>, and there a great deal of scope for emulating these models using the current framework. Human groups The model has also been compared against human data from experiments testing cooperation between players in a multi-user game.

Reference-contexts: But soon after its introduction, less virulent strains of the myxoma virus appeared and began to spread through the population. The drift of myxoma towards various non-lethal strains is shown in figure 5. Thus, since defectors need cooperators to exploit, successful parasites tend to evolve strategies for supporting cooperators <ref> (May and Anderson, 1983) </ref>. values e (c)=0.8, e (n)=1.0, r1 (c)=0.4, r0 (c)=0.0, r1 (n)=0.4, r0 (n)=0.6. A: The initial payoff matrix for this system satisfies the requirements for a Prisoners Dilemma problem (Axelrod, 1981).

Reference-contexts: However, in moving to these architectures, engineers are faced with the massive (and computationally intractable) problem of control. How can distributed biological creatures coordinate their various multiple components to achieve computational goals? Presently, researchers at Santa Fe are exploring this issue <ref> (eg. Mitchell, Crutchfield and Hraber, 1994) </ref>. Treating locally-interacting aggregate systems as an equivalence class opens the possibility of broadly understanding the dynamics of these systems in general, and engineering them to exhibit appropriate adaptive properties.

Reference-contexts: In this game defection (exploitation of a partner without giving mutual benefit) can potentially offer greater rewards than cooperation and happens to be the games Nash equilibrium. The repeated game with humans, however, usually leads to mutual cooperation, <ref> (Poundstone, 1992) </ref>, and so too it is with the model in this paper (cooperators increase while defectors decrease).
