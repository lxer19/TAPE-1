Reference-contexts: Almost all researchers agree that some direct measure of past use is the most significant predictor of future use. Fussler and Simon, in their seminal 1969 study, concluded that past use is the only good indicator of future use <ref> [4] </ref>. Slote, in his study of 1971, agreed: "The most recent 6 use pattern as reflected by the current circulation is a strong and valid predictor of the future use [of books]: : : . <p> This does not mean, however, that maximal trees are inherently flawed; in fact, due to the large variance it is hard to tell exactly how well maximal trees perform. We need a way of choosing 24 recommended by Fussler and Simon <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> In this way, titles that will not be used often in the future can safely be placed in the depository. We have followed the latter approach, as in previous studies of library book use <ref> [4, 16, 17] </ref>.

Furthermore, we do not study all the titles in Widener, since some 1.5 million titles are not yet in the computer system. 8 The results we have obtained thus apply not to Widener as a whole but to some "sub-Widener" that excludes many relatively unpopular titles.

Reference-contexts: Proponents of this view hope that because of the work involved in recalling a title from the depository, casual students of a topic will be guided to the higher quality titles in the main collection (see, e.g., <ref> [18, page 201] </ref>). The other school of thought, the "What readers do want" school, believes the library should try to minimize use of the depository by predicting patterns of future use.
