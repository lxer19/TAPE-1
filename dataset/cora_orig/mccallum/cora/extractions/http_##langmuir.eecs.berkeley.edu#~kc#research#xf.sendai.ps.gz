Reference-contexts: The simulations show three different `states'; laminar flow, virtual cathode oscillation and warm flow. Warm flow occurs when the electrons have a spread of energy, either due to an instability or by thermal injection, when they pass though the potential minimum. Birdsall and Bridges <ref> [3] </ref> showed that a small thermal spread (few percent) of injected electrons damps virtual cathode oscillations in a short circuited diode. <p> The value of the potential minimum, V m , is: V m = E 0 (ff 2 1) (6) The potential minimum has a range from 0 to 3 4 E 0 . As V ! 0 and E 0 finite, these equations agree with Birdsall and Bridges <ref> [3] </ref> analysis of a diode with no potential bias. To numerically resolve the potential minimum, x must be smaller that the potential of the minimum. <p> We have found in our simulations that a small temperature does change the value of the critical current.

Reference-contexts: the initial velocity, eE 0 = 0 1 At the Hull cutoff, the limiting current is given by J c J CL = 9 4 at u 0x ! 0, where J CL is the unmagnetized Child-Langmuir limiting current: J CL = 9 2e 3 d 2 (2) Lau et.al <ref> [4] </ref> have worked out the results of an initial finite drift. The unmagnetized limiting current is: J CL = 9d 2 2e p p This agrees with Jaffe [6]. <p> A few 1d runs confirmed the formation of the potential minimum and the increase of the limiting current. When the potential minimum was not resolved the limiting current found agreed with the E 0 = 0 limiting current. For the magnetized case, Lau et.al. <ref> [4] </ref> have plotted the effect of initial velocity on the critical current.

Reference-contexts: For an injected current less than the limiting current a steady state solution exists, greater than the limiting current a steady state solution does not exist. Injecting current larger than the critical current causes a rapid reduction in transmitted current. <ref> [5] </ref> This work expands on the work of Verboncoeur and Birdsall [5] and Gopinath et.al [1] from 1d to 2d to investigate the added degree of freedom. 3 Theory Critical Current In simulations at the plane of injection, with a J specified, there must be an average injection velocity, in order <p> Injecting current larger than the critical current causes a rapid reduction in transmitted current. <ref> [5] </ref> This work expands on the work of Verboncoeur and Birdsall [5] and Gopinath et.al [1] from 1d to 2d to investigate the added degree of freedom. 3 Theory Critical Current In simulations at the plane of injection, with a J specified, there must be an average injection velocity, in order to have a finite charge density ( ~ J = ~v). <p> We have found in our simulations that a small temperature does change the value of the critical current.

Reference-contexts: The unmagnetized limiting current is: J CL = 9d 2 2e p p This agrees with Jaffe <ref> [6] </ref>. Because of the initial velocity, the gradient at the cathode may and does become negative, and the potential curve moves down until it has a minimum (somewhere close to the cathode for E 0 t V ) at which point the potential is negative. <p> To see the effect of the finite drift we need to resolve the potential minimum. Expanding the analysis done by Jaffe <ref> [6] </ref> the potential minimum, x m , forms at: x m = (1 + 1 + V 3 (4) with, ~ ffi = (1 2ff) 1 + ff; ff = 1 + V 1 + 1 + V (5) Note ff varies between 1 (E 0 ! 0) and 1 2

Reference-contexts: The warm for the warm unmagnetized case was worked out by Langmuir <ref> [7] </ref>. We will use this analysis along with the cold magnetized theory of give us an estimate the change of the limiting (critical) current by adding a temperature. <p> The electrons with higher velocity will be collected with some velocity. For a thermal distribution the unmagnetized Child-Langmuir <ref> [7] </ref> limit is: J CL = 9 2e 3 (d x m ) 2 (1 + 2:66 kT e + : : :) (7) Where kT e is the electron temperature at the cathode, V m the potential minimum, and x m is the potential minimums position.

Reference-contexts: This ignored the initial half step backward in velocity used at t = 0 for leap frog integration, as discussed in Birdsall and Langdon <ref> [9] </ref>, page 43. Without time centering we found that the particles add high frequency "noise", short wavelength density perturbation and produce a spread of velocities.
