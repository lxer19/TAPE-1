Title: CODA Project Online access to Electronic Journals, ACM Special Issue The CODA Project OnLine Access
Author: Peter Kirstein 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the UCL CODA project, working with a large database of journal articles of chemical journals in several compound document forms (text/image). As part of the project, we had to set up a database comprising approximately 500,000 pages of technical papers in a mixture of SGML, ODA and bit-map representations; our experiences in, setting up this database and organising its searching are described. We provide a number of interfaces to access that data over various forms of network - LAN, the Internet and the ISDN in particular. Our users experiences are presented in working with the data.

Reference-contexts: There is a considerable body of recent work in this area; mostly this is concerned with specialised document collections, which have been put together for other purposes or even specifically for studying the problems involved. An example of this is the Dienst system <ref> [1] </ref> from Cornell U, Department of Computer Science. <p> Overview of the CODA Project The American Chemical Society (ACS), Bellcore, Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), Cornell University and OCLC collaborated in the CORE project [7] to deliver electronic information from primary publications to end-user chemists. Although this project originated from the same institution as the Dienst project <ref> [1] </ref>, they came from different parts of Cornell U, and, as far as we can judge, had no relationship with each other. The period of the journals covered by both the CORE and the CODA pilots was largely dictated by the availability of data in electronic form.

Reference-contexts: That project is designed to access a distributed document collection, and is a logical follow-on from the project we describe here. That project is developing well the distributed search facilities, and makes heavy use of the World Wide Web (WWW) <ref> [2] </ref>. This has the advantage of not incurring the problems we describe below in building up the database; it cannot give, however, the sort of experience of access to conventional journals that we are describing in this paper.

Reference-contexts: There are other projects attempting to provide access to journal collections; these have normally been restricted to work with scanned images of the journals (e.g. the Red Sage project <ref> [3] </ref>, [4]). This has been partly because this is the only form in which the data could be assembled, and partly because that is the only form that the publishers were willing to supply. In this paper, we discuss a quite difference sort of activity.

Reference-contexts: An important aspect of the interchange of documents between different systems is the choice of data representation; two popular formats are the Standard General Markup Language (SGML <ref> [5] </ref>) and the Office Document Architecture (ODA [6]). SGML is a tagging language, which is used to mark up documents according to a set of Document Type Definition (DTD); these DTDs can be defined by each publisher, though there is an attempt to use common DTDs in different areas. <p> As part of this experiment Bellcore scanned most of the pages of ACS journals published between 1989 and 1994 - some several times. They processed the typesetting tapes from the same journal issues into a SGML <ref> [5] </ref> format so that it may be indexed and used in the pilot. By the end of the project, they were providing electronic access to a large electronic database containing approximately 60,000 articles, representing 400,000 pages of journal articles of the American Chemical Society (ACS) for the period 1989-94. <p> It can be integrated with the users' facilities, so that it is possible to extract information for other purposes always subject, of course, to consideration of copyright and other constraints. 5.2 The Main Characteristics of SGML and ODA 5.2.1 The Characteristics of SGML SGML <ref> [5] </ref> is a system of specifying intellectual markup for documents. The point of intellectual markup is that one denotes what an element represents, rather than what it looks like. <p> extending the work into using more efficient storage, lower data transmission, and more generalised document searching tools The starting point for all is the work of Michael Lesk at Bellcore who built a number of tools to convert the original ACS data from their typesetting form into the SGML format <ref> [5] </ref>. This data is augmented with scanned images of the journals and diagrams to form a rich enough base of information to build the database upon - again an activity undertaken by Lesk [11].

Reference-contexts: An important aspect of the interchange of documents between different systems is the choice of data representation; two popular formats are the Standard General Markup Language (SGML [5]) and the Office Document Architecture (ODA <ref> [6] </ref>). SGML is a tagging language, which is used to mark up documents according to a set of Document Type Definition (DTD); these DTDs can be defined by each publisher, though there is an attempt to use common DTDs in different areas. <p> The paper discusses the way the database was set up - which involved conversion from a SGML representation into an ODA one <ref> [6] </ref>, the methods of indexing, the access methods provided, and our user experience. We discuss also CODA Project,On-line access to Electronic Journals ACM special issue 3 the motivation of many of our implementation choices, and the lessons to be learned from our experiences.. <p> For the same reason, the version of BK-D to which we gave our users access was only xx GB - the data for 1993. Our main user activity was with the whole database in the form of the Open Document Architecture (ODA) <ref> [6] </ref> form. The comparisons between ODA and SGML are given in [8] and Section 6; of some importance is that ODA has a unitary data content which includes text and image, so that the image portion with extracted graphics could be encompassed in the same database (ODA-D). <p> Another advantage is that it is so flexible that it is possible to express the styles of the publisher by providing a specific DTD or set of DTDs. 5.2.2 The Characteristics of ODA ODA has quite different properties from SGML. The ODA standard <ref> [6] </ref> describes an abstract view of an office document and a document processing model as well as an interchange format.

Reference-contexts: Finally, in Section 11, we draw conclusions both from our experience in setting up the pilots and the users reactions to it. 2.

Reference-contexts: There were differences between the CORE and CODA projects <ref> [8] </ref> but these are not discussed in this paper. This project started in 1991, when UCL-CS was heavily involved with ESPRIT PODA projects (e.g. [9]) in the use of ODA. <p> The format of the typesetting tapes need not be the same as (a) or even (b). CODA Project,On-line access to Electronic Journals ACM special issue 6 4.3 The Text/Image Data The text portion of the journal articles themselves were provided in several forms - many discussed in <ref> [8] </ref>. The basic raw text data was received in SGML format from Bellcore (SG-D). The extracted image data (EI-D), mentioned in Section 3.1, were used for the tables, equations and figures. <p> Our main user activity was with the whole database in the form of the Open Document Architecture (ODA) [6] form. The comparisons between ODA and SGML are given in <ref> [8] </ref> and Section 6; of some importance is that ODA has a unitary data content which includes text and image, so that the image portion with extracted graphics could be encompassed in the same database (ODA-D). <p> However, the ODA format does need a proper browser to be read. Both ODA and SGML allow editing and modification of the source; this is not the case with a page description language like Postscript. Converters between ODA and SGML are straightforward to implement <ref> [8] </ref>. An SGML text file can be searched directly with a string-based search engine; to search an ODA representation for the occurrence of text strings, it is not possible to index the ODA file itself; it is necessary to index an auxiliary file such as an SGML version. <p> The converter uses a translation specification which determines how the SGML elements are to be converted into ODA entities. While the development of this tool represented a major part of the UCL work, it has been well described in <ref> [8] </ref>, [20]; Due to the size of the dataset, the most sensible device for storing the documents is an Optical JB; we have developed a JB interface library which virtualises the JB as a single large storage device, so that application programs do not need to track the locations of files <p> a very long-winded process; CORE has usually worked for a longer time with smaller databases on disc store, and been very hesitant to commit to using the JB. 7.2 Database Sizes and Access Times We now have considerable experience on the size of the data, and on the access times <ref> [8] </ref>. We have the text components of the database for most of 1988-1994, and the bitmap form for much of 1989-1994. For recent years, there have typically been 15-16K articles p.a. in the database; of these we have typically made available 8K articles p.a. in bit-map form also. <p> We expect to introduce at a later stage other document stores, which have less constraints on their usage than the current ACS ones. A fuller discussion of the various User interfaces available in the CODA and CORE projects is given in <ref> [8] </ref>, [20]. 9. User Experiences We had had considerable feed back from the users on what was needed to make them interested in participating in accessing journals electronically, or what they require once they have started to participate. Their views can be categorised into availability, accessibility, presentation and facilities.

Reference-contexts: There were differences between the CORE and CODA projects [8] but these are not discussed in this paper. This project started in 1991, when UCL-CS was heavily involved with ESPRIT PODA projects (e.g. <ref> [9] </ref>) in the use of ODA. Originally, the CORE project used no standard language for the representation of the text, so that ODA was a natural choice for the CODA project. Later the ACS textual material became available in SGML form.

Reference-contexts: This in itself may be different in future such projects, if the publishers provided the Value Added Services.. Both OCLC and Chemical Abstracts (a division of the ACS) provided some of the secondary services; the Chemical Abstracts data was provided, and the OCLC Newton search engine <ref> [10] </ref> was used in the CORE project by Cornell U - though not by UCL. 4. The Different Data Sets and their Retrieval 4.1 The Source Data. <p> The first was Idx-si-db, the second Idx-bk-db. 4.5 Data Search It is usual in the library field to do bibliographic search on attributes such as author, journal and subject - and key words. In the CORE project, with its library orientation, a standard search engine called Newton <ref> [10] </ref> from OCLC was used; this has facilities for field search with Boolean Operations. This search engine was available only near the end of that project, and we felt it rather limiting in its capabilities.

Reference-contexts: Bellcore derived the graphic images by scanning the microfilm copies of the published journals and using custom OCR techniques to identify page components such as figures, tables and schemas (captionless figures) since no other record of the images is available <ref> [11] </ref>. Moreover the formats even of the text material has changed in the last 15 years; for this reason, while some of the text data does indeed go back to 1980, that before 1989 is incomplete - only 3500 of the articles prior to that date are in electronic form. <p> This data is augmented with scanned images of the journals and diagrams to form a rich enough base of information to build the database upon - again an activity undertaken by Lesk <ref> [11] </ref>. It was our intention to provide a document database which could be queried in a convenient manner, and allowed the users to browse their results on-screen using a number of different tools.

Reference-contexts: For some purposes we intended using the full scan images, together with a an appropriate retrieval mechanism; hence we needed a full database of these images (SI-D), which we received from Bellcore. Finally, there was a proprietary Hypertext/image system called SuperBook <ref> [12] </ref> from Bellcore, so that all the data for one year was provided also in this form (BK-D). We had the image data for 1988-94. However, we have made available to our users only .the articles from 1991-94 in the full image form in SI-D. <p> For this reason, Even when the documents to be retrieved were in the ODA format (ODA-D), the searching was done on the SGML text version (SG-D) - but these were arranged to point to articles in ODA-D. The SuperBook version <ref> [12] </ref> of the system had its information in a Hypertext format (BK-D), with its own search and retrieval engine; the indexing therefore had to be done independently, leading to an index database of Idx-bk-DB. <p> At present we provide a number of interfaces to access that data, including WAIS [13], SuperBook <ref> [12] </ref> and PixLook (also from CODA Project,On-line access to Electronic Journals ACM special issue 11 Bellcore [18]). We are also evaluating how SuperBook, can be extended to give intelligent Hypertext guidance to users [19].

Reference-contexts: From the SGML form of the data, both we and the CORE project have derived field-indexed versions of the text data which can be searched very fast. UCL decided to provide full text search using the text searching package WAIS <ref> [13] </ref>. WAIS is the Wide Area Information Server tool developed and placed in the public domain by Thinking Machines Corp, and now being developed further as a commercial product by WAIS Inc. <p> At present we provide a number of interfaces to access that data, including WAIS <ref> [13] </ref>, SuperBook [12] and PixLook (also from CODA Project,On-line access to Electronic Journals ACM special issue 11 Bellcore [18]).

Reference-contexts: Xwaisq is an X-based question program which is provided with the WAIS distribution. The size of this index database (Idx-oda-DB), which pointed to the data in ODA-D, is 6.1 GB. WAIS has the capability to access documents via the WWW using WAISGATE <ref> [14] </ref>. To exercise this feature, we derived an index of the HTML data in HTML-D, using the WAIS indexing mechanism, which was called Idx-html-DB. <p> The earlier Public Domain versions of WAIS have facilitates for free text search; they were used in the early trials. The commercial version of WAIS from WAIS Inc <ref> [14] </ref> also has the capability for field search with Boolean operations; this is the version we used on most of our trials, since it met most closely the wishes of our users. <p> In fact there is now also a Public Domain version of this search engine (WAIS-SF) [15] with similar facilities. For our trials, we used the version of <ref> [14] </ref>, which had somewhat more advanced features including the ability to use multiple processors (though only on different databases in the release we were using ), and could return a larger number of hits.

Reference-contexts: However, the SGML viewing tools have different types of translation specification file; such a file would be needed for each CODA Project,On-line access to Electronic Journals ACM special issue 10 viewing tool which end-users intended to use. The take-up of DSSSL <ref> [16] </ref> will remove this difficulty, but for the next year, possibly two, this will be the problem. Both SGML and ODA can be readily converted into a wide range of commonly-used word-processing formats; however often these converters lose the structure available in the original form.
