Abstract: We study the problem of counting the number of matchings of given cardinality in a d-dimensional rectangular lattice. This problem arises in several models in statistical physics, including monomer-dimer systems and cell-cluster theory. A classical algorithm due to Fisher, Kasteleyn and Temperley counts perfect matchings exactly in two dimensions, but is not applicable in higher dimensions and does not allow one to count matchings of arbitrary cardinality. In this paper, we present the first efficient approximation algorithms for counting matchings of arbitrary cardinality in (i) d-dimensional "periodic" lattices (i.e., with wrap-around edges) in any fixed dimension d; and (ii) two-dimensional lattices with "fixed boundary conditions" (i.e., no wrap-around edges). Our technique generalizes to approximately counting matchings in any bipartite graph that is the Cayley graph of some finite group.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we consider the d-dimensional rectangular (or cartesian) lattice L (n; d), where the vertices are the n d integer lattice points in <ref> [1; n] </ref> d , and two points x; y are connected by an edge iff they are unit distance apart. <p> We refer to the set of unmatched vertices as holes, and let N (u; v) be the set of near-perfect matchings with holes u and v . 1 A beautiful classical result due to Fisher, Kasteleyn and Temperley <ref> [1, 9, 14] </ref> provides an analytic (closed-form) expression for the number of perfect matchings in the two-dimensional lattice L (n; 2), for any n. <p> We extend this map to matchings in the natural way: if N is a matching, then t (N ) 2 [2; n 1 + 1] fi <ref> [1; n 2 ] </ref> is defined by (t (x); t (y)) 2 t (N ) iff (x; y) 2 N . Let M and N be the sets of perfect and near-perfect matchings respectively in the lattice L (n; 2) .

Reference-contexts: We extend this map to matchings in the natural way: if N is a matching, then t (N ) 2 <ref> [2; n 1 + 1] </ref> fi [1; n 2 ] is defined by (t (x); t (y)) 2 t (N ) iff (x; y) 2 N . Let M and N be the sets of perfect and near-perfect matchings respectively in the lattice L (n; 2) . <p> It is not clear how the positions of the two holes u and v affect the number of near-perfect matchings in a lattice graph, a quantity which is also studied in the context of monomer-dimer systems <ref> [2] </ref>. We conjecture that the injections we have established between near-perfect matchings with fixed holes and perfect matchings might shed light on this correlation.

Reference-contexts: Equivalently, we can think of dominoes as covering a pair of adjacent squares (cubes) in the dual lattice. This is a classical problem in statistical physics, first introduced by Fowler and Rushbrooke in 1937 <ref> [3] </ref>, and is the earliest example of a large class of problems concerned with computing the number of non-overlapping arrangements of figures of various shapes on a lattice (see, e.g., [11, 16] for a survey). The problem arises in several physical models.

Reference-contexts: In three dimensions, the same problem occurs in the theory of mixtures of molecules of different sizes and in the cell-cluster theory of the liquid state. For further background information, see <ref> [4, 11] </ref> and the references given there. The problem also has inherent combinatorial interest: clearly a domino arrangement is simply a matching, so we are actually being asked for the number of matchings of specified cardinality in the lattice graph.

Reference-contexts: In fact, in both of these cases the problem is known to be #P-complete for general graphs: counting perfect matchings in a graph [15], and matchings of specified cardinality in a planar graph <ref> [5] </ref> are both #P-complete problems. Thus it is extremely unlikely that the Fisher, Kasteleyn and Temperley technique for fixed genus graphs can be extended to answer these questions for all lattices. In recent years, there have been considerable advances in the design of efficient approximation algorithms for counting matchings.

Reference-contexts: Jerrum and Sinclair <ref> [6] </ref> showed the existence of a fpras for counting matchings of any cardinality up to (1 ff)k (for constant 0 &lt; ff &lt; 1) in arbitrary graphs containing a k -matching. <p> perfect matching yields a unique near-perfect matching.) Condition (1) is known to hold for all dense graphs, all graphs with sufficiently good expansion properties, and almost every random bipartite graph in the B (n; p) model for any density p above the threshold value for existence of a perfect matching <ref> [6] </ref>. However, these results shed no light on the special case of lattice graphs since (1) is not known to hold for them (even in two dimensions). <p> The approximation algorithm referred to in the theorem is based on simulation of a rapidly mixing Markov chain whose states are matchings <ref> [6, Theorem 5.3] </ref>. Theorem 4 (Jerrum and Sinclair) There exists a fpras for counting the number of perfect matchings, jMj, in any family of 2m-vertex graphs that satisfies jN j=jMj q (m), for some fixed polynomial q . <p> Theorem 4 (Jerrum and Sinclair) There exists a fpras for counting the number of perfect matchings, jMj, in any family of 2m-vertex graphs that satisfies jN j=jMj q (m), for some fixed polynomial q . The remark following this result in <ref> [6] </ref> points out that this polynomial relationship between near-perfect and perfect matchings also allows one to approximately count matchings of arbitrary cardinality in polynomial time. <p> It is already known that almost every graph satisfies (1) for a certain fixed polynomial q , and that the condition can be efficiently tested for an arbitrary graph <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps any graph that does not satisfy (1) can be efficiently decomposed in such a way that the resulting components satisfy (1), and hence fall within the scope of Theorem 4; this idea was used in <ref> [7] </ref> to obtain an approximation scheme for the general permanent whose running time, though still exponential, improves substantially on nave deterministic methods. We hope that the methods of the present paper will contribute to a better understanding of condition (1) for general graphs.

Reference-contexts: This is actually based on a more general result which shows that the number of perfect matchings in any planar graph can be computed in polynomial time by evaluating a suitable determinant. In fact, the technique extends to counting perfect matchings in any family of graphs with fixed genus <ref> [10] </ref>. Thus, in particular, the periodic two-dimensional lattice e L (n; 2), which has genus 1 for all n, can also be handled. However, the technique breaks down completely in three or more dimensions, about which very little is known.

Reference-contexts: Counting matchings is a central problem in computer science and has received much attention since the seminal work of Valiant <ref> [15] </ref>, who proved that it is #P-complete for general graphs. The enumeration of perfect matchings (where the dominoes are required to completely cover the graph) is equivalent to computing the permanent of a 0-1 matrix, a long-studied problem in its own right [12]. <p> Moreover, it yields no information about the number of matchings of cardinality smaller than m, even in the planar case. In fact, in both of these cases the problem is known to be #P-complete for general graphs: counting perfect matchings in a graph <ref> [15] </ref>, and matchings of specified cardinality in a planar graph [5] are both #P-complete problems. Thus it is extremely unlikely that the Fisher, Kasteleyn and Temperley technique for fixed genus graphs can be extended to answer these questions for all lattices.
