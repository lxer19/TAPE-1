Reference-contexts: This methods is based on a general anytime algorithm for probabilistic inference called Epistemic Constraint Propagation (ecp) [ Ramoni and Riva, 1993 ] . The incremental character of ecp allows the decision maker to trade execution time with precisions of solutions and, given a measure of the "object-related value" <ref> [ Boddy and Dean, 1994 ] </ref> of each solution | that is, a measure of how good is the answer of the decision maker | to plan the resources allocation during the evaluation of the id. The reminder of this paper is structured as follows.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the number of conditional probabilities needed to specify a conditional dependency grows exponentially with the number of parent variables. A sound method for evaluating an id requires complete information and is therefore computationally intractable <ref> [ Cooper, 1990 ] </ref> , even for approximate results [ Dagum and Luby, 1993 ] . These results leave no much hope to devise an efficient method for a sound propagation of probabilities in ids and this limitation may impair their applicability to many real-world domains.

Reference-contexts: literal l 1 is bounded by: P fl (l 1 ) X (1P fl (:l 1 _C i ))P fl (l 1 ) 2 s1 X P fl (:l 1 _C i ) The propagation of these constraints is performed by a version of Waltz's propagation algorithm extended to intervals <ref> [ Davis, 1987 ] </ref> : each proposition is labeled with a set of possible values, and the constraints are used to restrict this set.

Reference-contexts: a probabilistic reasoning system, an incremental refinement policy means that the system starts with a subset of the large amount of information needed to specify a standard id, bounds the probability values within certain intervals, "and proceeds by computing increasingly narrow probability intervals that contains the tightest entailed probability interval" <ref> [ Frisch and Haddawy, 1994 ] </ref> . The implementation of such a desirable policy requires the use of an anytime algorithm, able to incrementally derive a fully specified probabilistic model (i.e. a joint probability distribution) from the available information, by incrementally refining the accuracy of the solutions.

However, few years ago, Horvitz <ref> [ Horvitz, 1989 ] </ref> identified a class of inference policies for probabilistic reasoning systems, called incremental refinement policies, able to improve the accuracy of their solutions as a monotonically increasing function of the allocated resources and the available information.

Reference-contexts: formalism able to provide a compact representation of decision problems. ids are based on the axioms of probability and decision theory, and they provide a normative framework to model decision-making under risk. ids were introduced in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community in a simplified form, called Bayesian Belief Networks (bbns) <ref> [ Pearl, 1988 ] </ref> , and they gained back the interest of AI researchers to the normative methods of probability theory. A bbn is a direct acyclic graph in which nodes represent stochastic variables and arcs represent conditional dependencies among the variables.

Reference-contexts: When the Stochastic Dominance criterion fails, we have to resort to a weaker condition of admissibility, able to discriminate among competing strategies when the expected utilities intervals are not disjoint. Pittarelli <ref> [ Pittarelli, 1988 ] </ref> proposes to adopt a generalized version of the well-know Hurwicz criterion. This criterion suggests to rank the possible strategies according to a weight average of their minimum and maximum expected util ity, using a constant ff , with 0 ff 1.

Reference-contexts: This paper investigates the anytime character of a method for evaluating ids and provides a measure of the "object-related value" of the solutions. This methods is based on a general anytime algorithm for probabilistic inference called Epistemic Constraint Propagation (ecp) <ref> [ Ramoni and Riva, 1993 ] </ref> . <p> When all literals but one in a clause are labeled as f alse bcp forces the unlabeled literal to be true. In order to extend the bcp from Boolean to probabilistic truth-values, we derived, from the theory of probabilistic entailment <ref> [ Ramoni and Riva, 1993 ] </ref> , a probabilistic interpretation of disjunction able to define which constraints are imposed by a clause over the (probabilistic) truth-values of the literals occurring in it. <p> The incompleteness with respect to other clauses of the language is the result of a compromise between expressivity and efficiency, since theoretical analysis and empirical results show that the ecp propagation runs to completion in linear time with respect to the number of clauses <ref> [ Ramoni and Riva, 1993 ] </ref> , thus making easy the estimation and the trading off of the computational effort. 3 Epistemic Diagrams Epistemic diagrams (eds) are graphical formalisms developed on the basis of ecp. <p> ja j ; : : : ; a s ) k=j It is worth noting that the resulting posterior probability set is still convex, since it is the result of a linear mapping of the extreme values of a probability interval, and ecp was proved to preserve convexity during propagations <ref> [ Ramoni and Riva, 1993 ] </ref> . Furthermore, in ibns, the inversion formula shares with the chain rule the appealing property of propagating only the available information, thus preserving the incremental refinement policy of ecp. 3.3 Properties There are two main properties of eds worth to be mentioned. <p> First of all, eds converge toward point valued probabilities, and when all the conditionals defining a complete probabilistic model are supplied, they behave as standard id, returning point-valued probabilities, since the ecp is complete for clauses representing joint probability distributions <ref> [ Ramoni and Riva, 1993 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: They include a new class of bbns, called Ignorant Belief Networks (ibns) <ref> [ Ramoni and Riva, 1994 ] </ref> . Using an ecp-based lbms, eds are able to exploit the incremental character of ecp. eds are able to reason on the basis of any subset of the conditional probabilities defining a standard bbn.
