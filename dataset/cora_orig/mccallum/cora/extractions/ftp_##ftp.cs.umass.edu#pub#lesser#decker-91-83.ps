Abstract: Coordination is a crucial behavior in cooperative distributed problem solving (CDPS). Analyzing coordination requires an understanding of the interplay between the agents, their problem, and their environment. The core behaviors of distributed coordination in CDPS systems are the coherent specification and scheduling of tasks over the set of distributed agents working on sets of interrelated problems. The complexity of, and uncertainty about, the problem interrelationships make distributed task coordination difficult. This paper describes a causal model of this process that links the interrelationships, called coordination relationships, to the local scheduling constraints of distributed agents. Besides coordination relationships, environmental uncertainty and the lack of infinite computational resources also make distributed coordination difficult. It is not only the presence or absence of a coordination relationship that is important, but its quantitative properties: how likely is it to appear, how significant is its effect, etc. These aspects determine the usefulness of a particular coordination relationship in the context defined by an environment, a problem to be solved, and an agent architecture. This paper discusses the analysis of coordination relationships, using as an example our abstract model for the facilitates relationship. We detail the derivation and assumptions of this model and apply it to the the design of a generalized coordination module that is separate from, and interfaces cleanly with, the local scheduler of a CDPS agent. A set of simulation experiments is described that test our assumptions and design process in the coordination of a group of real-time problem-solving agents.

Reference-contexts: This validates our claim that we are examining general issues of coordination and the effect of environmental factors on coordination, while still allowing us to ground experiments in real, implemented agent architectures. It also is appealing from an asynchronous, layered subsumption architecture point of view <ref> (Brooks, 1986) </ref>. Secondly, it allows us to take advantage of the advances currently being made in planning and scheduling. The original PGP mechanisms had to deal with a rather unsophisticated local scheduling mechanism; to do so, it often kept track of and enforced constraints on its own.

Reference-contexts: More sophisticated real-time schedulers actually make the coordination task easier by directly interpreting most of the needed coordination behaviors (in the form of scheduling constraints) <ref> (Decker et al., 1992a) </ref>. Scheduling constraints may be hard or soft. Admissibility refers to hard constraints. A local scheduling algorithm is admissible with respect to a hard constraint if it always produces a feasible schedule if that is possible.

Reference-contexts: Other than having a common language, the agents may be heterogeneous and have different capabilities and responsibilities. We are developing a formal model of task environment structures for CDPS and single-agent scheduling tasks <ref> (Decker et al., 1992b) </ref>. <p> Each task group has a deadline D (T ). The quality of the execution or result of each task influences the quality of the task group result Q (T ) in a precise way <ref> (Decker et al., 1992b) </ref>. These quantities, deadline and quality, can be used to evaluate the performance of a system. <p> Communication after the start of processing has no effect; the effect on quality when q 6= 0 is computed analogously. A fuller treatment of the mathematical details can be found in <ref> (Decker et al., 1992b) </ref> 3 . Two tasks can be mutually facilitating; either there will be a clear preference for one over the other via the shared global utility function, or they are co-routiningiteratively exchanging results while executing in parallel. <p> We have developed a much more comprehensive model (introduced in <ref> (Decker et al., 1992b) </ref>) of task environments that allows a mathematical specification of task interactions for either analysis or simulation. We are using this model to analyze problems in CDPS, parallel scheduling, and real-time scheduling.

Reference-contexts: After developing a quantitative theory, qualitative statements may be derived from it. We are now focusing on generalizing the partial global planning mechanism. This process involves identifying the types of coordination relationships that are used by the basic PGP algorithm and that exist but that are not used <ref> (Decker and Lesser, 1992) </ref>, developing a conceptual model that clearly specifies the roles of a PGP-style coordination algorithm as identifying coordination relationships and producing behaviors (primarily the creation and refinement of local scheduling constraints), and generalizing the partial global planning algorithm itself (GPGP) (Decker and Lesser, 1992). <p> that exist but that are not used <ref> (Decker and Lesser, 1992) </ref>, developing a conceptual model that clearly specifies the roles of a PGP-style coordination algorithm as identifying coordination relationships and producing behaviors (primarily the creation and refinement of local scheduling constraints), and generalizing the partial global planning algorithm itself (GPGP) (Decker and Lesser, 1992). Our current approach views the coordination mechanism as modulating local control, not supplanting ita two level process that makes a clear distinction between coordination behavior and local scheduling (Corkill and Lesser, 1983). <p> Several hypotheses about our environmental assumptions and our design are articulated, and experimental results are presented. 1 Other potential coordination relationships include inhibits, cancels, constrains, causes, enables, and subgoal <ref> (Decker and Lesser, 1992) </ref>. 1 2 Conceptual Model and Environmental Assumptions Our approach to distributed task coordination rests on a conceptual, causal model of the generalized PGP-style distributed coordination process (see Figure 1). Information flows from the environment through the agent's coordination mechanism and local scheduling mechanism, eventually influencing performance. <p> The content of the information does not necessarily reflect the position or the policy of the Government and no official endorsement should be inferred. 1 Other potential coordination relationships include inhibits, cancels, constrains, causes, enables, and subgoal <ref> (Decker and Lesser, 1992) </ref>. 2 Our description of the coordination process is consistent with social views of organizational coordination mechanisms or behaviors: the use of rules, regulations, and standards; the creation of supervisory and decision-making hierarchies; and specialization or departmentalization.

Reference-contexts: The term quality in the model summarizes several possible properties of actions or results in a real system: certainty, precision, and completeness of a result, for example <ref> (Decker et al., 1990) </ref>. Quality of an agent's performance on an individual task is a function of the timing and choice of agent actions (`local effects'), and possibly previous task executions (`non-local effects'). <p> pressed for time that class of tasks typically is (a relative measure based on the average deadline), and how amenable it is to trading off time for quality (the particular mix of methods available to each task, each with its own average duration and result quality; c.f., approximate processing algorithms <ref> (Decker et al., 1990) </ref>, anytime algorithms (Boddy and Dean, 1989)).

Reference-contexts: Slack has long been viewed as a coordination behavior and as such should be an organizational parameter <ref> (Durfee and Lesser, 1988) </ref>. <p> Delay time is similar to the slack time that was investigated in Durfee and Lesser's predictability vs. responsiveness experiments <ref> (Durfee and Lesser, 1988) </ref>. 5 Discussion and Conclusion These experiments show that abstract simulations can produce interesting phenomena and can be used to validate hypothesis about coordination strategies.

Reference-contexts: Less uncertainty in the environment means less uncertainty in the existence and extent of the CRs, less uncertainty in local scheduling, and therefore less complex coordination behavior (communication, negotiation, partial plans, etc) is needed (for example, one can have cooperation without communication <ref> (Genesereth et al., 1986) </ref>). Even given complete certainty, the lack of infinite computational resources/time results in the necessity of satisficing, not optimal, behaviors.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 1: Conceptual view of the distributed coordination process The primary interruption to the flow of information just described is uncertainty. Uncertainty also flows from the environment (the open systems concept <ref> (Hewitt, 1991) </ref>), and through the above mechanisms to create local scheduling uncertainty.

Reference-contexts: later than task T i 's deadline), and the objective function is to minimize the number of tardy jobs (those that miss their deadlines) then there exists a O (n 2 ) local scheduling algorithm that is admissible (with respect to ready times) and rational (with respect to soft deadlines) <ref> (Kise, 1978) </ref>. As a designer of a coordination algorithm, we now have some powerful information for designing coordination algorithms. For many scheduling problems a useful (i.e., non-exponential) local scheduling algorithm cannot be proven to be rational.
