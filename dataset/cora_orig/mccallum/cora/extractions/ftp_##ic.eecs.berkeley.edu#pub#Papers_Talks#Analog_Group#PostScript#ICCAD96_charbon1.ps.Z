Abstract: A number of methods are presented for highly efficient calculation of substrate current transport. A three-dimensionalGreen's Function based substrate representation, in combination with the use of the Fast Fourier Transform, significantly speeds up the computation of sensitivities with respect to all parameters associated with a given architecture. Substrate sensitivity analysis is used in a number of physical optimization tools, such as placement and trend analysis for the estimation of the impact of technology migration and/or layout re-design.

Reference-contexts: To alleviate the problem, heavily over-designed structures are generally laid-out, thus seriously limiting the advantages of innovative technologies. The effects of thermally inhomogeneous substrate on circuit performance were first studied in <ref> [1] </ref>. According to this approach, the substrate was first discretized into a resistive/capacitive mesh. DC/steady-state analysis was carried out by solving directly the system of simultaneous thermal and electrical equations. Transient analysis was performed by using variable time-step trapezoidal integration techniques on the system of simultaneous equations.

Reference-contexts: DC/steady-state analysis was carried out by solving directly the system of simultaneous thermal and electrical equations. Transient analysis was performed by using variable time-step trapezoidal integration techniques on the system of simultaneous equations. More efficient techniques for DC and transient analysis have been proposed in <ref> [2] </ref>. Direct LU factorization was replaced with the Incomplete Choleski Conjugate Gradient iterative method in the DC solution. In the transient simulation the RC mesh was reduced to a macro-model that could be used efficiently inside a Asymptotic Waveform Evaluation (AWE) simulator.

Reference-contexts: Extensive literature has recently appeared on modeling and analysis of silicon substrate. Compact and accurate macro-models for both lightly and heavily doped substrates have been proposed by several authors, e.g. <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. Recently, attempts to introduce the effects of substrate on medium-sized integrated circuits have been made using a numerical finite-difference (FD) method. This technique is versatile and general in nature, since it can handle lateral and vertical resistivity variations and arbitrary substrate geometries.

Reference-contexts: The grid size is made fine in areas close to the substrate contacts and coarse in distant regions. The use of non-uniform or coarse grids usually involves a speed-accuracy trade-off. Boundary element methods can also be used for parasitic extraction. In <ref> [5] </ref> the use of the Green's Function was proposed for a finite uniform medium, with Neumann boundary conditions, exploiting the technique of the separation of variables. Image-charge based concepts have been used, in order to avoid the series computation involved in the method. <p> For isotropic medium with uniform dielectric constant * the Green's Function is relatively straightforward <ref> [5] </ref>. On the contrary, for a multiple-layer substrate, the problem is more complex due to presence of more boundary conditions.

Reference-contexts: In many design problems however, a dynamic substrate noise analysis would be preferable. Recently, a number of authors have addressed the problem of performing these tasks efficiently within physical assembly phases e.g. <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. Common to these approaches is the use of a FD method for the evaluation of the electric field on a coarse grid spanning the workspace combined with AWE for an efficient solution of the resulting system of simultaneous algebraic equations.

Reference-contexts: One can immediately see that equation (8) is almost identical to the two-dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) of k mn K ( p; q) = m=0 n=0 p ) cos (n Q In fact one can easily show that equations (8) and (9) can be interchanged <ref> [11] </ref>. Hence, the computation of p ij ultimately requires only a simple DCT. Several efficient techniques exist for efficient computation of the DCT, e.g. FFT based techniques only require a computation complexity O ( P Q log 2 P Q). <p> Several inversion techniques, both direct and iterative, have been implemented. Among the direct methods, a LU decomposition based algorithm of complexity O (jPj 3 ) has been used for relatively small configurations ( 1000 partitions). Larger circuits required the use of various accuracy-driven simplification schemes, discussed in <ref> [11] </ref>. <p> Alternatively, we propose two methods based on the Green's Function approach, exploiting the fact that small adjustments in the position and orientation of layout elements result in a small change in the potential matrix P <ref> [11] </ref>. The first technique is based on the Sherman-Morrison formula. Consider a single partition i within the moving contact, matrix P will only change in 2N 1 entries at most. <p> The expression in (7) is well-behaved for all finite-sized contacts in the workspace <ref> [11] </ref>. Hence, the terms will necessarily ffip i;j1 &lt; 1 and ffip i1;j &lt; 1. <p> Similarly, using (24), (26) and, slightly modified, (27), expressions can be easily derived for T ` = d or * N . Finally, consider the sensitivity of term p ij with respect to contact depth c. Expressions of term p ij for non-zero depth, derived in <ref> [11] </ref>, are reported here. p ij = 1 c s c 2 2 + s P 1 P 1 fi a )sin (m a 1 flfi sin (m a 4 a ) (a 2 a 1 )(a 4 a 3 ) fi fi b 2 b 1 fl fi b 4

Reference-contexts: These techniques have been used during the evaluation phase in a Simulated Annealing (SA) based placement tool called PUPPY-A <ref> [12] </ref>. <p> If a violation to specifications has occurred, then a precise extraction step must be performed and the precise value for the violation is used to drive the cost of the annealing in a manner similar to <ref> [12] </ref>. Otherwise, the contribution of substrate noise to node j in degrading performance K i is considered negligeable and the cost function will not take it into account. <p> The cost relative to the remain ing analog-specific constraints, as well as area and wiring length will however be computed and use to drive the annealing similarly as in <ref> [12] </ref>. 4 Results In this section experiments are presented using the techniques discussed in this paper, implemented in a C package called SUBRES. <p> The placement was performed using the heuristics presented in Algorithm 3. The constraints on the maximum admissible noise voltage at each node of the VCO were used in the cost function of the annealing in a manner identical to that proposed in <ref> [12] </ref>. Figure 3 shows the estimated values of switching noise voltage at each location in the chip at different temperatures during the annealing. As expected, the annealing attempted to reduce the switching noise amplitude at critical receptors locations in the VCO, CP and LPF.

Reference-contexts: Then, the sensitivity of a given performance K i is computed with respect to the parameters P j related to each noise source j acting on every node in the analog modules being placed. Using constrained optimization techniques <ref> [13] </ref> and the specification on the maximum positive and negative performance degradation 4K i += , a set of bounds P (bound) j is generated only for a reduced set of critical nodes n c . <p> The set n c is generated based on the cumulative effect of all parasitic noise sources acting on each node similarly as in <ref> [13] </ref>. In step 3 a given placement configuration is mapped onto a fully connected graph G S (V; E), whose vertices V are the substrate contacts and edges E are weighted by the conductance Y ij or resistance R ij between the corresponding vertices i and j. <p> Using this fact a sensitivity based model of the PLL could be constructed relating the PLL jitter performance to the level of the noise voltage peak-to-peak present at some critical locations in the VCO. Then, constraint generator PARCAR <ref> [13] </ref> was used to derive a set of constraints on the maximum admissible noise voltage in each one of the 85 sensitive nodes of the VCO. The CPU time needed for the constraint calculation was 2545 seconds.
