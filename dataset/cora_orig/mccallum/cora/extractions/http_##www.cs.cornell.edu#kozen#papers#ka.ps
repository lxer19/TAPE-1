Title: A Completeness Theorem for Kleene Algebras and the Algebra of Regular Events  
Author: Dexter Kozen 
Address: Ithaca, New York 14853  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Cornell University  
Abstract: We give a finitary axiomatization of the algebra of regular events involving only equations and equational implications. Unlike Salo-maa's axiomatizations, the axiomatization given here is sound for all interpretations over Kleene algebras.

The states are the row and column indices. <p> The language accepted by A is the element u T A fl v 2 K : For automata over F , the free Kleene algebra on free generators , this definition is essentially equivalent to the classical combinatorial definition of an automaton over the alphabet as found in <ref> [20, 11] </ref>. A similar definition can be found in [8]. 16 Example 13 Consider the two-state automaton in the sense of [20, 11] with states fp; qg, start state p, final state q, and transitions p ! p q ! q p ! q q ! q : Classically, this automaton <p> F , the free Kleene algebra on free generators , this definition is essentially equivalent to the classical combinatorial definition of an automaton over the alphabet as found in <ref> [20, 11] </ref>.

Then u T A fl v = u T A v : Proof. In the combinatorial approach [11, 20], the unique minimal automaton is obtained as a quotient by a Myhill-Nerode equivalence relation after removing inaccessible states.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Kleene algebras are algebraic structures with operators +, , fl , 0, and 1 satisfying certain axioms. They arise in various guises in a number of settings: relational algebra [22, 23], semantics and logics of programs <ref> [14, 24] </ref>, automata and formal language theory [18, 19], and the design and analysis of algorithms [1, 21, 12]. An important example of a Kleene algebra is Reg , the family of regular sets over a finite alphabet . <p> The algebra of regular events and its axiomatization is the subject of the extensive monograph of Conway [8]. The bulk of Conway's treatment is infinitary. In 1981, we gave a complete infinitary equational deductive system for the algebra of regular events that is sound over all *-continuous Kleene algebras <ref> [14] </ref>. A completeness theorem for relational algebras with fl , a proper subclass of Kleene algebras, was given by Ng and Tarski [23, 22], but their axiomatization relies on the presence of a converse operator. <p> Schematic equational axiomatizations for the algebra of regular events, necessarily representing infinitely many equations, have been given by Krob [17] and Bloom [6]. There is some disagreement regarding the definition of Kleene algebras <ref> [8, 24, 14] </ref>. The literature contains several inequivalent definitions. In this paper we introduce yet another: a Kleene algebra is any model of the equations and equational implications given in x2. <p> In semantics and logics of programs, Kleene algebras are used to model programs in Dynamic Logic and Dynamic Algebra <ref> [14, 24] </ref>. In the design and analysis of algorithms, n fi n Boolean matrices and matrices over the so-called min; + algebra are used to derive efficient algorithms for reachability and shortest paths in directed graphs [1, 21].

Reference-contexts: Schematic equational axiomatizations for the algebra of regular events, necessarily representing infinitely many equations, have been given by Krob <ref> [17] </ref> and Bloom [6]. There is some disagreement regarding the definition of Kleene algebras [8, 24, 14]. The literature contains several inequivalent definitions. In this paper we introduce yet another: a Kleene algebra is any model of the equations and equational implications given in x2. <p> The result is proved by encoding the classical combinatorial constructions of the theory of finite automata, e.g. state minimization, algebraically. 2 There is an extensive literature on the algebra of regular events <ref> [8, 4, 17] </ref> and much of the development of this paper is a recapitulation of previous work. <p> We then use the uniqueness of the minimal deterministic finite automaton to obtain completeness. Conway states a similar theorem without proof in the latter part of his book [8, Theorem 5, p. 108]. Krob <ref> [17] </ref>, based on work of Boffa [7], and Archangelsky [3] have recently independently obtained similar results based on different techniques. 1.1 Examples of Kleene Algebras Kleene algebras abound in computer science. We have already mentioned the regular sets Reg . <p> These results are apparently new, although the deter-minization result was recently given independently by Krob <ref> [17, x10.2] </ref> using different techniques. Lemma 17 For every simple *-free automaton (u; A; v) over F there is a deterministic automaton ( b u; b A; b v) over F such that u T A fl v = b u T b A fl b v : Proof.

Reference-contexts: The relationship between these two formalisms forms the basis of a well-developed classical theory. Classical developments range from the more combinatorial <ref> [20, 11] </ref> to the more algebraic [29, 10, 5, 9, 27]. The approach taken in this paper must ultimately be attributed to Conway [8]. 15 In this section we define the notion of an automaton over an arbitrary Kleene algebra. <p> Since we will be interpreting expressions only over Kleene algebras, and all interpretations factor through F via the canonical map, this usage is without loss of generality. The following definition is closer to the algebraic definition used for example in [8, 5] than to the combinatorial definition used in <ref> [20, 11] </ref>. Definition 12 A finite automaton over K is a triple A = (u; A; v) ; where u; v 2 f0; 1g n and A 2 M (n; K) for some n. The states are the row and column indices. <p> The language accepted by A is the element u T A fl v 2 K : For automata over F , the free Kleene algebra on free generators , this definition is essentially equivalent to the classical combinatorial definition of an automaton over the alphabet as found in <ref> [20, 11] </ref>. A similar definition can be found in [8]. 16 Example 13 Consider the two-state automaton in the sense of [20, 11] with states fp; qg, start state p, final state q, and transitions p ! p q ! q p ! q q ! q : Classically, this automaton <p> F , the free Kleene algebra on free generators , this definition is essentially equivalent to the classical combinatorial definition of an automaton over the alphabet as found in <ref> [20, 11] </ref>. A similar definition can be found in [8]. 16 Example 13 Consider the two-state automaton in the sense of [20, 11] with states fp; qg, start state p, final state q, and transitions p ! p q ! q p ! q q ! q : Classically, this automaton accepts the set of strings over = fa; bg containing at least one occurrence of b. <p> The matrix A a in (55) corresponds to the adjacency matrix of the graph consisting of edges labeled a in the combinatorial model of automata <ref> [11, 20] </ref> or the image of a under a linear representation map in the algebraic approach of [29, 5]. An automaton is deterministic according to this definition iff it is deterministic in the sense of [11, 20]. <p> matrix of the graph consisting of edges labeled a in the combinatorial model of automata <ref> [11, 20] </ref> or the image of a under a linear representation map in the algebraic approach of [29, 5]. An automaton is deterministic according to this definition iff it is deterministic in the sense of [11, 20]. The automaton of Example 13 is simple, *-free, and deterministic. 17 5 Completeness In this section we prove the completeness of the axioms of x2 for the algebra of regular events. <p> The proof is by induction on the structure of the regular expression. We essentially implement the combinatorial constructions as found for example in <ref> [11, 20] </ref>. The ideas behind this construction are well known and can be found for example in [8]. <p> This construction is also folklore and can be found for example in [19, 27]. This construction models algebraically the combinatorial idea of computing the *-closure of a state; see <ref> [11, 20] </ref>. 20 Lemma 16 For every simple automaton (u; A; v) over F , there is a simple *-free automaton (s; B; t) such that u T A fl v = s T B fl t : Proof. <p> Lemma 17 For every simple *-free automaton (u; A; v) over F there is a deterministic automaton ( b u; b A; b v) over F such that u T A fl v = b u T b A fl b v : Proof. We model the subset construction <ref> [11, 20] </ref> algebraically. Let (u; A; v) be a simple *-free automaton with states Q. By Definition 14, A can be expressed A = a2 where each A a is a 0-1 matrix. 21 Let P (Q) denote the power set of Q. <p> follows: b u T b A fl b v = e T b A fl Xv u XA fl v 2 Lemma 18 Let (u; A; v) be a simple deterministic automaton and let (u; A; v) be the equivalent minimal deterministic automaton obtained from the classical state minimization procedure <ref> [11, 20] </ref>. Then u T A fl v = u T A v : Proof. In the combinatorial approach [11, 20], the unique minimal automaton is obtained as a quotient by a Myhill-Nerode equivalence relation after removing inaccessible states. We simulate this construction algebraically. <p> v 2 Lemma 18 Let (u; A; v) be a simple deterministic automaton and let (u; A; v) be the equivalent minimal deterministic automaton obtained from the classical state minimization procedure <ref> [11, 20] </ref>. Then u T A fl v = u T A v : Proof. In the combinatorial approach [11, 20], the unique minimal automaton is obtained as a quotient by a Myhill-Nerode equivalence relation after removing inaccessible states. We simulate this construction algebraically. Let Q denote the set of states of (u; A; v).
