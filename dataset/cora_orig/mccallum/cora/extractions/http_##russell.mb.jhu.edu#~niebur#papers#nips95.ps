Title: Control of Selective Visual Attention: Modeling the "Where" Pathway

Abstract: Intermediate and higher vision processes require selection of a subset of the available sensory information before further processing. Usually, this selection is implemented in the form of a spatially circumscribed region of the visual field, the so-called "focus of attention" which scans the visual scene dependent on the input and on the attentional state of the subject. We here present a model for the control of the focus of attention in primates, based on a saliency map. This mechanism is not only expected to model the functionality of biological vision but also to be essential for the understanding of complex scenes in machine vision.

Reference-contexts: These maps are organized around the known operations in early visual cortices. They are implemented at different spatial scales and in a center-surround structure akin to visual receptive fields. Different spatial scales are implemented as Gaussian pyramids <ref> (Adelson, Anderson, Bergen, Burt, & Ogden, 1984) </ref>. The center 1 In (Niebur, Koch, & Rosin, 1993), a similar model was developed using periodic "40Hz" modulation.

Reference-contexts: difference in orientation at every location, and which also takes into account the relative "strength" of the oriented edges. 2.2.4 Change The appearance of an object and the segregation of an object from its background have been shown to capture attention, even for stimuli which are equiluminant with the background <ref> (Hillstrom & Yantis, 1994) </ref>. We incorporate the attentional capture by visual onsets and motion by adding the temporal derivative of the input image sequence, taking into account chromatic information.

Reference-contexts: The principal task of the other major pathway is the determination of the location of objects and therefore it is called the Where pathway or, again for anatomical reasons, the dorsal pathway. In previous work <ref> (Niebur & Koch, 1994) </ref>, we presented a model for the implementation of the What pathway. The underlying mechanism is "temporal tagging:" it is assumed that the attended region of the visual field is distinguished from the unattended parts by the temporal fine-structure of the neuronal spike trains. <p> The output of the saliency map consists of a spike train from neurons corresponding to this selected area in the topographic map which project to the ventral ("What") pathway. By this mechanism, they are "tagged" by modulating the temporal structure of the neuronal signals corresponding to attended stimuli <ref> (Niebur & Koch, 1994) </ref>. 2.3.1 Fusion Of Information Once all relevant features have been computed in the various feature maps, they have to be combined to yield the salience, i.e. a scalar quantity.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, it is straightforward to incorporate some top-down influence. For instance, in a "Posner task" <ref> (Posner, 1980) </ref>, the subject is instructed to attend selectively to one part of the visual field.
