Abstract: In the designing of a distributed real-time multimedia system such as multimedia conferencing system, the network bandwidth scarcity issue is a big problem faced by all designers. Unicast-only IP connections have serious scaleup problems. Using this kind of networking links, when a data packet needs to be sent to multiple recipients, the source node must send the same data packet repeatedly to each receiver. If the data packet size is huge, just as those used in multimedia systems, inevitably, congestion at some routers will occur because at these routers the same data packets are queued multiple times due to the repeated sending by the source. As a promising solution to the problem mentioned above, IP multicasting has been gaining attentions from both computing industry and academia. Residing above IP layer, multicast protocols transfer datagrams efficiently to neighboring routers towards different recipients. Using multicast-aware links, the source node no longer needs to send datagrams multiple times. This single copy of the data packet will only be replicated when it reaches a branching point on a pre-computed multicasting path tree on which the nodes are the recipients. In this paper, IP multicasting is looked in detail. A critical study focusing on several multicast protocols such as DVMRP, CBT, and PIM is carried out. As an application example, MBone, which has been used as multicasting testbed by the internet engineering community for several years, will be analyzed. The real-time application protocol RTP/RTSP and the use of MBone in multimedia system will is also closely studied.
