Reference-contexts: Since West Germany is a modern, Western country, we expect to see some decentralization, despite the stronger orientation toward the central city which exists in most European nations <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.2 East Germany Only eleven cities meet the specified criteria. Again, Berlin is not included. A list of the cities can be found in Table 5. <p> The conclusion that East German cities have been centralizing appears, based on the data, to be a valid one. Is this a reasonable conclusion? Cities in European, communist countries are likely to exhibit a strong orientation toward the center for all the reasons mentioned in <ref> [1] </ref>, but to a stronger degree, as the communist cites tend to be more strictly planned, with more emphasis toward the center, more officed employment toward the center, and a greater lack of dependence on private transportation.

Reference-contexts: A is a constant with no direct physical interpretation. As with the exponential, in a comparison of results, smaller A, ff, or fi implies more decentralization. Mills presents six criteria he feels a "reasonable measure of suburbaniza-tion" should satisfy (I quote each from <ref> [2] </ref>): 1. It should identify central city and suburban jurisdictions. . . and should contain parameters that permit estimation of effects of central city and suburban conditions on suburbanization. 2. <p> The measure should accommodate a variety of specific density patterns. . . . Clearly, (2) satisfies 1 and 2. Permitting P c to vary separately with P and L c satisfies 3. The conditions on ff and fi satisfy 4 and 5 <ref> [2] </ref>. An interesting feature of this model is that it resembles the standard production function, although unlike the Cobb-Douglas function, ff + fi &gt; 1 2 here.

Reference-contexts: Again, Berlin is not included. A list of the cities can be found in Table 5. Two sets of population were available: populations from 1950 and 1970-1990, based on 1990 jurisdictions projected backwards to previous years [6]; and populations based on boundaries in effect at that time for 1960-1990 <ref> [3, 4, 5, 6] </ref>. Again, the distribution of cities is fairly good in terms of location and population distribution.

Reference-contexts: A.2 Available Data I found two potential sources for the needed data for non-U.S. countries: the U.N.'s Demographic Yearbook and individual countries' statistical yearbooks. Curiously, the Demographic Yearbook only reports separate statistics for central city and metro area populations for 37 nations <ref> [11] </ref>, reporting only one figure for all other countries. A further difficulty is that many of the nations for which separate statistics exist are small and only have a handful of cities with populations over 100,000. Finally, the Demographic Yearbook does not report any land areas.
