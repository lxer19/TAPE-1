Abstract: I present an overview of some ongoing research on IVHS-related prob lems at the University of Michigan Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Our work covers three princi - pal areas: (1) individual route planning under timedependent uncertainty, (2)decentralized computation of network equilibria using market-price mechanisms, and (3)dynamic traffic modeling for routing and situation assessment.

Reference-contexts: A stochastic version of this condi tion, with the times replaced by ex pectations, would similarly validate the use of the standard algorithm with expectations. However, this version would not be reasonable, as demonstrated by some sim ple examples <ref> (Hall, 1986) </ref> . (Moreover, the expectation version of the shortest-path algorithm would not produce correct results for these examples.) As an alternative, I propose the following condition. <p> Although I believe this algorithm to possess advantages over existing meth ods for com - puting fastest path in stochastic timede - pendent networks (e.g., <ref> (Hall, 1986) </ref>), definitive statements await the result of formal and empirical analysis, which has just be - gun. This ap proach should also be applica - ble to problems with non-additive (but monotonic) costs, generalizing the scope of existing search-based optimization algo - rithms in OR and AI.

Reference-contexts: In the distributed version, we re quire that flow allocation decisions are made sepa - rately for each movement re quirement. The following figure depicts a simple trans - portation network (from <ref> (Harker, 1988) </ref>). 1 4 We have investigated three market configu - rations for solving multicommodity flow problems. In model S, the economy consists of a set of shipper agents (consumers), one for each movement re quirement.

Reference-contexts: This sort of situation should be expected in realistic highway networks, where traffic patterns vary throughout the day, as well as in other transporta tion net - works (e.g., bus routes), where transfer times de pend on fixed schedules. For the deterministic case, however, it has been shown <ref> (Kaufman & Smith, 1993) </ref> that the standard shortest-path algorithm is indeed sound as long as the network satisfies the following reasonable consis tency condition.

Reference-contexts: Dynamic Traffic Interpretation Finally, we are exploring the use of modern uncertain reasoning techniques from AI for transportation tasks such as dynamic traffic interpretation. We represent our state of in - formation in probabilistic networks, graphical representations of random variables and their in terdependencies <ref> (Pearl, 1988) </ref> . The technical advantage of probabilistic net - works is that they exploit independence relations among the variables for computa - tion, without imposing any uniform inde - pendence re strictions.

Reference-contexts: We have studied network equilibrium problems as a special type of distributed re - source-allocation task. Our general ap - proach, called market-oriented pro gram-ming <ref> (Wellman, 1992) </ref>., works by casting a problem as a computational economy and deriving its competitive equilibrium. We formulate the given problem as a general - equilibrium sys tem, with agents corre - sponding to the decision-making entities, and goods corresponding to relevant re - sources and outcome attributes. <p> This problem of knowledge-based model construc - tion is an active area of research in the un - certain reasoning community <ref> (Wellman, Breese, & Goldman, 1992) </ref>. 5. Summary In summary, we are investigating the appli - cation of AI techniques to a variety of transportation and IVHS-related problems.
