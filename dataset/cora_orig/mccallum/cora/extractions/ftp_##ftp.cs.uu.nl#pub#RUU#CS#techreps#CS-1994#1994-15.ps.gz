Abstract: This paper presents a framework for the theoretical comparison of information retrieval models based on how the models decide aboutness. The framework is based on concepts emerging from the field of situation theory. So called infons and profons represent elementary information carriers which can be manipulated by union and fusion operators. These operators allow relationships between information carriers to be established. Sets of infons form so called situations which are used to model the information born by objects such as documents. An arbitrary information retrieval model can be mapped down into the framework. Special functions are defined for this purpose depending on the model at hand. An important aspect is the inference mechanism which is mapped to inference between situations. Two examples are given based on the Boolean retrieval and coordination level matching models. The framework allows the comparison of retrieval models at an abstract level. Starting from an axiomatization of aboutness, retrieval models can be compared according to which axioms they are governed by. This approach is highlighted by the theoretical compari son of Boolean retrieval with coordinate level matching. fl This work was partly performed while employed at the Utrecht University.

Reference-contexts: However, in order to avoid the heavily loaded word relevance, we will instead use the term aboutness. Our goal is to study aboutness within a general theory of information. Such theories are emerging from the field of situation theory (see for example <ref> [BE87] </ref>, [BE90], and [Dev91]). We propose that situation theory is a sufficiently powerful theory of information for studying the aboutness relation between documents or between a document and a query. Lalmas & Van Rijsbergen have recently expounded the merits of situation theory in information retrieval [LR92].

For example, from the infon hhR,water,pollution; 1ii the infon hhI,pollution; 1ii can be inferred, as the latter infon is intuitively implied by the former. Inferences of this sort are available to model the strict inference mechanism of a retrieval system.

Reference-contexts: In 1971, Cooper introduced an objective notion of relevance termed logical relevance. A stored sentence is logically relevant to a representation of an information need if and only if it is a member of some minimal premiss set of stored sentences for some component statement of that need <ref> [Coo71] </ref>. <p> The set of situations will be denoted by S. 2.3 The Aboutness Relation between Situations The relation j between two situations expresses that one situation carries information about another situation. In the literature, one can find a number of informal characterizations of this notion like "topically related" <ref> [Coo71] </ref>, "about" [Mar77], "likely to contain information about" [Rij92], and "correspondent to" [Nie92]. As mentioned earlier, in this article the neutral term aboutness is preferred. It is formalized as a relation over situations: j S fi S.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the expressive power of the logical framework has been demonstrated by several authors. However, expressiveness has been restricted showing how existing retrieval models can be mapped to logical inference mechanisms. In addition a number of principles have been launched like for example the "logical uncertainty principle" <ref> [Rij86] </ref>. Notions such as the soundness and completeness of an inference mechanism have been defined within the context of information retrieval, but so far there have not been soundness and completeness results as is typical in logic. <p> A formula may contain negation, expressing for example that the user wants documents that are not about a certain keyword t. All documents that do not have t in their characterization satisfy the query :t. In other words, Boolean retrieval operates under a Closed World Assumption <ref> [Rij86] </ref>. Negation is modelled at the level of profons as follows: sit (:t) = fhhI, t; 1iig. 1 Without loss of generality we require the formula to be in a disjunctive normal form.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In recent years the logical approach to information retrieval has gained quite a deal of attention (see for example [Bru93],[CC92],[LR92],[Nie92], and <ref> [Rij89] </ref>). Various inference mechanisms have been proposed. Furthermore, the expressive power of the logical framework has been demonstrated by several authors. However, expressiveness has been restricted showing how existing retrieval models can be mapped to logical inference mechanisms.
