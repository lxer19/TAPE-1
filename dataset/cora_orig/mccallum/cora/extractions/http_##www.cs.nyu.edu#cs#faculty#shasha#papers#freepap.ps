Reference-contexts: Comparison to Past Research This paper generalizes the work on the edit distance between strings [6, 11, 13, 16, 20, 21, 25] and trees [19, 28, 29]. Various kinds of constrained and generalized edit distance on strings and trees have been developed <ref> [1, 9, 10, 17, 27] </ref>. Our degree-2 distance, when applied to unordered trees, is a restricted form of the constrained distance previously reported in [27].

Reference-contexts: Relabeling node n means changing the label on n. Deleting a node n means making the neighbors of n (except an arbitrarily specified neighbor n 0 ) become the neighbors of n 0 and then removing n. (This amounts to contraction of the edge between n and n 0 <ref> [4] </ref> and making the resulting node have label of n 0 .) Insert is the complement of delete. This means that inserting n as a neighbor of n 0 makes a subset of the current neighbors of n 0 become the neighbors of n.

Reference-contexts: One can solve the problem by using Gabow and Tarjan's algorithm in <ref> [5] </ref>. 6 Algorithm A Input: Unordered trees T 1 and T 2 . <p> of finding the maximum weighted matching in BG is O (minfn i ; n j g (E + V log V )) when the edges have general weights and is O ( V E log (V W )) when the edges have integral weights where W is the maximum weight <ref> [5] </ref>. Without loss of generality, assume n i n j . Then V is at most n i + n i n i and E is at most n i n i . Suppose the node label alphabet for unordered trees is finite. Then the maximum edit cost is finite.
