Abstract: Future Video-On-Demand (VOD) servers will need to support many existing and emerging video data types. These data types include 15-fps (frames per second) animation, 30-fps NTSC (National Television Systems Committee) television quality video and 60-fps HDTV (High Definition Television) video. The different display speeds and the frame sizes of the various video types impose a major constraint on the design of VOD storage systems. This paper presents the results of an experimental study, conducted on a Silicon Graphics Inc. Onyx computer system, that investigated the impact of of these video types on the design of a VOD storage system. The key issues involved in supporting these different video types in a VOD environment are: (1) the video allocation method, and (2) the proper block size (a block is a basic unit of several contiguous video frames that will be accessed from several disks each time a request is made) to use for data striping and retrieval. Two allocation schemes, logical volume striping and application level striping, along with varying frame and block sizes for each of the three different video data types are examined in this paper. The focus of our study was to determine the maximum number of concurrent accesses that can be supported with a guaranteed quality of service. The degree of scalability (i.e., striping data over more disk arrays) of the experimental VOD system used was also studied.

Reference-contexts: To perform a systematic experiments, the size of a compressed video frame is assumed to be fixed. Current video compression schemes usually adopt the run-length encoding, thus resulting variable frame sizes. However, it is our experience that JPEG video with few scene changes will produce close frame sizes <ref> [1] </ref>. Similarly, a video stream without severe scene changes also can be encoded as MPEG stream with only I frames, thus resulting close frame sizes. Since a video block consists of several video frames, the performance will be closed to what we obtained.

Reference-contexts: However, only one video type (e.g., usually MPEG or AVI video) was assumed in these studies. We have already reported the experimental performance of a storage system based on an array of RAID 3 disks in <ref> [19] </ref> using a Silicon Graphics's (SGI) Onyx symmetric multiprocessor computer. RAID 3 disk array uses bit or byte striping onto 8 synchronized disks. We used 30-fps 2 compressed NTSC video (e.g., MPEG-2) for that study. <p> This scheme potentially can improve the access time of a single disk access because of parallel processing. However, it is not clear how logical volume striping performs for multiple concurrent accesses. We have proposed another allocation scheme called application level striping in <ref> [19] </ref>. In application level striping, the data can be striped through multiple logical volumes or disks. However, each logical volume is intentionally kept small (i.e., only one-way or two-way logical volume striping is used). Two-way logical volume striping is a striping over two RAIDs. <p> A more effective allocation scheme has to be designed to increase the supported number of concurrent accesses with a smaller buffer size. We have proposed an allocation scheme called application level striping in <ref> [19] </ref>. In application level striping, the video files are divided into blocks and stored on the constituted storage devices (e.g., RAID 3s) in a round-robin fashion. <p> The 30-fps NTSC video with fixed frame size of 32 KBytes and block size of 16 frames was adopted in our previous study. How application level striping supports the other video types with varying frame and block sizes was not considered in <ref> [19] </ref>. In this section, we use six striping widths: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24. Block sizes are varied from 16, 32, 64 to 128 frames. Since we already demonstrated in [19] that application level striping consisting of physical RAID 3 (i.e., 1 wide) resulted in the best performance, no <p> application level striping supports the other video types with varying frame and block sizes was not considered in <ref> [19] </ref>. In this section, we use six striping widths: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24. Block sizes are varied from 16, 32, 64 to 128 frames. Since we already demonstrated in [19] that application level striping consisting of physical RAID 3 (i.e., 1 wide) resulted in the best performance, no logical volume is used in this section. 5.1 Supporting 15-fps Animation Video Table 7 lists experiment results to support animation video using application level striping.

Reference-contexts: In our experiments, we did not apply any scheduling mechanism to the operating system to control the retrieval processes. Since no disk scheduling policies are implemented in the RAID 3 <ref> [20] </ref>, the access requests are served by the physical storage devices in a FCFS (First Come First Serve) basis 3 . All processes start around the same time.

Reference-contexts: Part (b) demonstrates that concurrent accesses are started from the first disk array, and load balancing is achieved after smoothing in Part (c). striping 2.3 Buffer Arrangement In all experiments, we allocated two buffers for each retrieval process (we called this buffering method the two-buffer scheme in <ref> [21] </ref>). The two buffers were used in a pipelined style, one for retrieval from the storage system, and the other for delivering data to the network interface. The roles of the two buffers are then exchanged in the next time interval.

Reference-contexts: However, the increase is less significant when block size is bigger than 32 frames or frame size is larger than 32 KBytes. This is because the size of the requested block greatly affects the achievable data transfer rate of a RAID <ref> [22] </ref>. The data transfer rate can be increased accordingly when we enlarge the requested block size until the size reaches a certain threshold. When the requested block size is larger than the threshold, a smaller increased data transfer rate is observed.
