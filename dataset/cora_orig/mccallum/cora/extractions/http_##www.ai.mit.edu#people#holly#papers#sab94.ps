Abstract: Sensors and internal states are often considered necessary components of any adaptively behaving organism, providing the information needed to adapt a creature's behavior in response to conditions in its external or internal environment. But adaptive, survival-enhancing behavior is possible even in simple simulated creatures lacking all direct contact with their environment evolutionarily shaped blind action may suffice to keep a population of creatures alive and reproducing. In this paper, we consider the evolution of the behavioral repertoires of such sensor-less creatures in response to environments of various types. Different spatial and temporal distributions of food result in the evolution of very different behavioral strategies, including the use of looping movements as time-keepers in these otherwise cognitively-challenged creatures. Exploring the level of adaptiveness available in even such simple creatures as these serves to establish a baseline to which the adaptive behavior of animats with sensors and internal states can be compared.

Reference-contexts: The environment defines a fitness function that is used for some sort of genetic search over the space of possible behaviors of individual creatures. Systems of this type include Wilson's original animat (1985), the Genesys/Tracker system <ref> (Jefferson et al., 1992) </ref>, Floreano's (1993a) work on nest-based foraging strategies, the work of Parisi, Nolfi, and Cecconi (1992) and Todd and Miller (1991a,b) on neural network-controlled creatures that evolve learning abilities, and Cec-coni and Parisi's (1993) neural networks with motivational units.

Reference-contexts: All of these systems differ from ours in that multiple creatures with different behaviors never interact in a common world, and as a result much of the richness of both social behavior and the effects of whole populations on a shared environment is left out. The RAM system <ref> (Taylor et al., 1989) </ref> is notable in having the potential to model arbitrary interactions between multiple animals in a gridworld by representing each part of the system as a distinct computer program.

Reference-contexts: Again we set the food regrowth rate to be equal to the maximum food amount per location, so that food regrows to its full level as soon as it can. 4 The Creatures As we described in our original statement of this research program <ref> (Todd & Wilson, 1993) </ref>, we are interested in the evolution of three components of behavior in response to different environment structures, namely action, sensation, and memory. Only the first, action, is actually necessary for behavior, and indeed adaptive behavior. <p> This effectively makes these non-splitting creatures immortal, a situation that can lead to such dire consequences as the eventual end of all evolution <ref> (as described in Todd, 1993) </ref>. In place of the disappearing likelihood of splitting, though, another action must increase in likelihood (since the creatures always select something to do at each time-step, even if it is just sitting still).
