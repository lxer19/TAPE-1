Abstract: The evolution of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) toward the use of multiple learning strategies calls on a multi-agent architecture. We show how such an architecture can be defined for the pedagogical component of an ITS. After considering the evolution of intelligent agents, we observe that ITS need to have cognitive agents able to model the human behavior in learning situations. They represent what we call actors, a category of reactive, adaptive, instructable and cognitive agents.To assume these properties we present an actor architecture with different layers of cognition: a reactive layer, a control layer, and a cognitive layer which contains learning capabilities. We provide a detailed view of this architecture and show how it functions with an example involving the different actors of a new learning strategy, the learning by disturbing strategy.

Reference-contexts: The role of the metatutor is to select the best strategy according to the learning objectives to reach (in relation with the curriculum) and the characteristics of the learner (learner model) <ref> [1] </ref>. All the agents interact according to an intelligent behavior that we precise in the following sections. 5 3.

Reference-contexts: In fact this evolution progressively highlighted several fundamental characteristics: (1) learning in ITS is a constructive process involving several partners, (2) various learning strategies can be used to improve the process such as one-on-one tutoring, learning with a co-learner [6], learning by teaching [14], learning by disturbing <ref> [2] </ref>. The consequence in term of ITS architecture is that we need to resort to a distributed architecture (multi-agent architecture) in which various partners can play a role. Flexibility in learning requires that the ITS be based on multiple strategies. <p> We provide a detailed view of this architecture and show 3 how it functions with an example involving the different actors of a new learning strategy, the learning by disturbing strategy <ref> [2] </ref>. 4 2. Toward a new agent-based ITS architecture The fundamental elements of an ITS architecture generally include a curriculum, a learner model and a pedagogical module. However, as mentioned above, we need a more flexible communication between the learner and the system, allowing various pedagogical interactions [12]. <p> Moreover, an actor can still decide to restrict the internal view on its behavior. 6. Design and implementation of the learning by disturbing strategy We will illustrate the functioning of the actor-based architecture with the 'learning by disturbing' strategy <ref> [2] </ref>. This strategy involves three actors (a tutor, a troublemaker, and an artificial learner) in order to stengthen the learner self-confidence, as indicated in section 2. In fact the old control task can remain valid in another context, typical-situation or control task 13 6.1.

Reference-contexts: Agents with diagnosis capabilities are intended to search a conclusion through a set of hypotheses [13]. However, these capabilities are insufficient to take on tutoring functions. We need a reasoning level and a dynamic improvement of agent's knowledge. The second category of agents are called instructable agents <ref> [11, 3] </ref> which can dynamically receive instructions or new algorithms (for instance new pattern matching algorithms), and agents that can learn or improve their learning according to an history of actions.

Reference-contexts: Reactive agents have only immediate responses to stimuli, without reasoning. Planning consists in finding a sequence of actions that will achieve a desired goal (sometimes by matching graphs or post-conditions of actions against the desired goal). Planning systems evolved from linear to nonlinear planners <ref> [4, 17] </ref>. Predictions follow from planning with hypothesis. Agents with diagnosis capabilities are intended to search a conclusion through a set of hypotheses [13]. However, these capabilities are insufficient to take on tutoring functions. We need a reasoning level and a dynamic improvement of agent's knowledge.

Reference-contexts: A reason is that if an agent is supposed to fulfill human capabilities it must have a large number of properties. Let us examine some of these properties. Agents have generally an autonomy; they can operate without human control <ref> [5] </ref> and interact with other agents (they have social ability) using an agent-communication language. They show a reactivity to the changes in the environment but also act according to a goal-directed behavior.

Reference-contexts: More recent ITS developments consider a cooperative approach between the learner and the system [8] using a co-learner. The system participates with the learner in the learning process and facilitates knowledge acquisition through interactions under the control of the learner. An extension of this approach was presented by Chan <ref> [6] </ref> with the learning companion who simulates the behavior of a second learner (the companion) who would learn together with the human learner. <p> In fact this evolution progressively highlighted several fundamental characteristics: (1) learning in ITS is a constructive process involving several partners, (2) various learning strategies can be used to improve the process such as one-on-one tutoring, learning with a co-learner <ref> [6] </ref>, learning by teaching [14], learning by disturbing [2].

Reference-contexts: They improve their own behavior in cooperating with other actors. 4.2 Global architecture The architecture (Figure 2) we need contains four modules (Perception, Action, Control and Cognition) distributed in three layers (Reactive, Control and Cognitive). The reactive layer is similar (but extended) to the Touring Machines <ref> [7] </ref>, consisting in perception and action subsystems that interface with the environment of the agent and three control layers (reactive, planning and modelling layers). Similarly, our architecture contains also a reactive layer, with direct association between perception and action modules, and a control layer which corresponds to the planning layer.

Reference-contexts: Initially, the control of the training was assumed by the tutor (prescriptive approach), not the learner. More recent ITS developments consider a cooperative approach between the learner and the system <ref> [8] </ref> using a co-learner. The system participates with the learner in the learning process and facilitates knowledge acquisition through interactions under the control of the learner.

Reference-contexts: Instructable agents can receive new instructions to perform new tasks, directly from the users or from the system (that performs an analysis of a sequence of actions). A third category of agents are called adaptive agents <ref> [9] </ref>. They can adapt their perception of situations and modify their decisions by choosing new reasoning methods.

(Ed), </editor> <address> New York, </address> <publisher> Academic Press. </publisher>
Reference-contexts: However, the third layer (cognitive layer) is not restricted to solving goal conflicts (as in Touring machines) but supports the ability to learn from experience which is an important element of an intelligent entity <ref> [10] </ref>. 8 An original point of this architecture is that each actor has the possibility to observe the previous behavior of the other actors, their trace of actions (and not only the results of actions).

Reference-contexts: Toward a new agent-based ITS architecture The fundamental elements of an ITS architecture generally include a curriculum, a learner model and a pedagogical module. However, as mentioned above, we need a more flexible communication between the learner and the system, allowing various pedagogical interactions <ref> [12] </ref>. This flexibility can be supported by several agents which assume a pedagogical role (as indicated in Figure 1) and may intervene in several strategies with different roles. This is the case of the tutor which appears in the one-on-one, the companion or the learning by disturbing strategies.

Reference-contexts: They show a reactivity to the changes in the environment but also act according to a goal-directed behavior. This last point converges toward a set of additional and humanlike properties of an agent such as beliefs, desires and intentions <ref> [15] </ref>. If we consider the evolution of intelligent agents we can distinguish a first period of research in which agents are defined with basic capabilities such as reactivity, planning, prediction and diagnosis. Reactive agents have only immediate responses to stimuli, without reasoning.
