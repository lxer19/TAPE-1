Title: A Quantitative Comparison of Graph-based Models for Internet Topology  
Author: Ellen W. Zegura and Kenneth L. Calvert and Michael J. Donahoo 
Keyword: Scalability, Network modeling, Internetwork-ing  
Abstract: Graphs are commonly used to model the topological structure of internetworks, to study problems ranging from routing to resource reservation. A variety of graphs are found in the literature, including fixed topologies such as rings or stars, "well-known" topologies such as the ARPAnet, and randomly generated topologies. While many researchers rely upon graphs for analytic and simulation studies, there has been little analysis of the implications of using a particular model, or how the graph generation method may affect the results of such studies. Further, the selection of one generation method over another is often arbitrary, since the differences and similarities between methods are not well understood. This paper considers the problem of generating and selecting graph models that reflect the properties of real inter-networks. We review generation methods in common use, and also propose several new methods. We consider a set of metrics that characterize the graphs produced by a method, and we quantify similarities and differences amongst several generation methods with respect to these metrics. We also consider the effect of the graph model in the context of a specific problem, namely multicast routing.

Reference-contexts: For a graph with n nodes and m edges, we consider the following topological properties: * Average node degree. (2m=n). * Diameter. The diameter of a graph is the length of the longest shortest-path between any two vertices <ref> [11] </ref>. Informally, a low diameter generally corresponds to shorter paths. We consider several variations on the diameter, depending on the metric used to construct and evaluate the shortest paths. <p> The diameter is the length of the longest path. * Number of biconnected components. A bicon-nected component (or bicomponent) is a maximal set of edges such that any two edges in the set are on a common simple cycle <ref> [11] </ref>. The number of bicompo-nents is a measure of the degree of "connectedness" or "edge redundancy" in a graph. Generally, a smaller number of bicomponents corresponds to a larger number of paths between nodes in the graph. We considered a number of other possible metrics, includ Edges Hop-diameter Bicomps L.

Reference-contexts: The number of "extra" edges of each type is controlled by parameters to the method. Clearly, if the random graphs generated are all connected, this construction results in a connected graph. Doar has independently proposed a graph generation method that has a somewhat similar hierarchical structure to this method <ref> [15] </ref>. The size of the graph (number of nodes) and the distribution of nodes between transit and stub domains in this method is controlled by the following parameters: Param. Meaning Ex.

Reference-contexts: That is, how do methods compare for problems of interest? To determine this effect, we consider the problem of multicast routing. We assume the reader is familiar with the concepts of multicasting, and center-based (or shared-tree) multicast routing. (See <ref> [16] </ref> for details). Many different generation methods have been used to study multicast routing algorithms, including the Waxman method [61] and well-known topologies such as the ARPAnet [63].

Reference-contexts: We also do not model link characteristics (e.g., bandwidth); such information can be easily included as an overlay to the basic topological structure, as needed for studying particular problems. Today's Internet can be viewed as a collection of interconnected routing domains <ref> [19] </ref>, which are groups of nodes that are under a common administration and share routing information. A primary characteristic of these domains is routing locality: the path between any two nodes in a domain stays entirely within the domain.

Reference-contexts: assessing algorithms, consider the following results: * Doar and Leslie found that the efficiency of their dynamic multicasting algorithms was reduced by as much as a half when using random graphs versus using hierarchically structured graphs designed to reflect some of the properties of real internetworks. (See Figure 5 in <ref> [26] </ref>.) * Wei and Estrin found that the traffic concentration in core-based multicast routing trees is comparable to traffic concentration in shortest-path trees for a network model with average node degree of about 3.0, but the traffic concentration is almost 30% higher in core-based trees when average node degree increased to <p> An increase in ff increases the number of edges in the graph, while an increase in fi increases the ratio of long edges to short edges [61]. Several variations on the Waxman method have been proposed <ref> [26, 63] </ref>; because they are essentially equivalent to the Waxman method, our study includes only the original method. We propose two new methods that are also intended to capture locality by relating edge probability to distance between vertices.

Reference-contexts: Note that our large sample size (1000 graphs/runs) relaxes the need for normality in this type of hypothesis testing <ref> [45] </ref>. for each metric. Note that, as expected, the frequency distributions for the two flat methods are very similar, and the Transit-Stub frequency distribution is dissimilar to the flat methods. Also note that the frequency distribution for the Transit-Stub method is tightly centered around 1.0 for both optimal metrics.

Reference-contexts: the traffic concentration in core-based multicast routing trees is comparable to traffic concentration in shortest-path trees for a network model with average node degree of about 3.0, but the traffic concentration is almost 30% higher in core-based trees when average node degree increased to 8.0. (See Figure 9 (a) in <ref> [63] </ref>.) * Mitzel and Shenker found that multicast resource reservation styles compared quite differently in the quantity of resources reserved for linear, tree and star topologies. (See Tables 4 and 5 in [44].) It should be clear from these examples that the network model does matter: the conclusions reached about the <p> An increase in ff increases the number of edges in the graph, while an increase in fi increases the ratio of long edges to short edges [61].
