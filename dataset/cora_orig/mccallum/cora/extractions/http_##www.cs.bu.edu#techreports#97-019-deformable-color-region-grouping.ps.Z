Abstract: Boston University Computer Science Technical Report 97-019, November, 1997. Abstract A new deformable shape-based method for color region segmentation is described. The method includes two stages: over-segmentation using a traditional color region segmentation algorithm, followed by deformable model-based region merging via grouping and hypothesis selection. During the second stage, region merging and object identification are executed simultaneously. A statistical shape model is used to estimate the likelihood of region groupings and model hypotheses. The prior distribution on deformation parameters is precomputed using principal component analysis over a training set of region groupings. Once trained, the system autonomously segments deformed shapes from the background, while not merging them with similarly colored adjacent objects. Furthermore, the recovered parametric shape model can be used directly in object recognition and comparison. Experiments in segmentation and image retrieval are reported.

Reference-contexts: This initial pose problem is a known weakness of many deformable model recovery schemes. Approaches to solving this have been suggested: graduated non-convexity [3], multi-grid approaches [24], and nonlinear programming methods <ref> [1] </ref>. In our system, we employ the downhill-simplex method [19] because it requires only function evaluations, not derivatives. Downhill-simplex method must be started not just with a single point, but with N + 1 points defining a initial simplex (where N is the number of variables in the function).

Reference-contexts: A system flow chart is shown in Fig. 1. We will now give a brief overview of the segmentation process as it is applied to find banana shapes in the example color image in Fig. 2 (a). First, the input color image is over-segmented via standard region-merging algorithms <ref> [2, 6] </ref>. The regions found by the over-segmentation module are shown in Fig. 2 (b). The output of this module also includes a standard region adjacency graph. Using this over-segmentation, candidate regions for interesting objects are determined based on their color features. <p> Finally, discarding the highest-frequency modes can also make recovery more robust to noise [18]. 4 Segmentation and Model Fitting The deformable model will now be used to guide grouping and merging of color regions. The process begins with over-segmentation using a traditional color region segmentation algorithm <ref> [2, 6] </ref>. There are two goals of the initial over-segmentation procedure: to avoid the effects of background and clutter in the subsequent stages, and to guarantee that region from adjacent objects are not merged. Background and clutter regions will be culled later using a model-driven approach. <p> For a new group of candidate regions, from the area of the group and its centroid, we can estimate the scale factor and translation parameters, then we sample N + 1 rotation parameters uniformly over the range <ref> [0; 2] </ref>, and compute the initial templates of varying orientation. The downhill-simplex algorithm is then used to adjust the parameters until convergence is obtained. Some grouping hypotheses have considerable common regions. In such cases, the matching parameters for one grouping hypothesis can be reused for another, thereby speeding convergence.
