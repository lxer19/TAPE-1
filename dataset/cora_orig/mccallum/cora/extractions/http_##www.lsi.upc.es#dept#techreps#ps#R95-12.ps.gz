Reference-contexts: Previous Work There are several formulations of interest for this work. One of the most important describes the analysis performed at the National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC) <ref> [DSMSW 82] </ref>, where FORTRAN functions to compute thermodynamic parameters are listed. The general frame of atmospheric convection can be found in [Sco 78] and a systematic exposition of the thermodynamics of atmospheres in [Hou 77] . The best-known package for presenting metorological data is McIdas [HUSB 89]. <p> For other parameters, we refer to <ref> [DSMSW 82] </ref> ( literally quoted for the sake of completeness) : W is the wet bulb potential temperature. M is as W for saturated conditions at (T ,p). A is as W for dry conditions (mixing ratio equal to zero) at (T ,p). <p> And this is done for a range of values of the parameter. The analytical formulation of each of the three sets of lines (dependent variables) is given in the formulae section. In <ref> [DSMSW 82] </ref> complete listings are given for the functions. The dry adiabat set is drawn in the usual ligth brown, and the wet adiabat and the humidity mixing ratio line sets are drawn in green. This coulour schema follows traditional practice. After this, the observed data have to be plotted.

Formulae To compute points and then draw humidity mixing ratio lines we have to calculate the water reference.

Reference-contexts: The most radical change in the program would be to group all directives and requests to and from the graphics package (in this case, GKS <ref> [HDGS 83] </ref>), in a single library of modules; this would act as the interface between this application and the graphics package. This is a concept borrowed from Object Oriented Programming: the encapsulation of the transmission of information between modules or groups of modules.
