Title: Model-Supported Exploitation as a Framework for Image Understanding  
Author: Anthony Hoogs and Douglas Hackett 
Address: P.O. Box 8048 Philadelphia, PA 19101  
Affiliation: Martin Marietta Management and Data Systems  
Abstract: Model-Supported Exploitation (MSE) is the central focus of the RADIUS project, whose goal is to use Image Understanding technology to improve the imagery exploitation process. This paper describes the assumptions and conditions applicable for using the MSE paradigm for IU research.

Reference-contexts: Through the use of site models (model-supported exploitation, or MSE), recent IU research results are being evaluated for future implementation in an operational setting by the Research and Development for Image Understanding Systems (RADIUS) project <ref> [GerWood94] </ref>. Model-supported exploitation uses a 3-D model, combined with imagery and sensor information, to serve as a framework within which IU is directed toward the goals relevant to RADIUS.

Reference-contexts: The scene type can provide important a priori information for determining what types of features may be present in the site, which algorithms may applied at what resolution, etc. For more details regarding the scene context, refer to the paper by Mundy and Vrobel <ref> [MundyVro94] </ref>. Each modeled object in the site may contain more information than the geometry of the model. The purpose of the object, its functionality and other object-specific parameters may be available to provide constraints of use to IU.

Reference-contexts: The storage and retention of object data is of continued interest to the RADIUS project <ref> [HoogsKnif94] </ref>. 3 Free Parameters When the site model has contributed all of its information, what remains for IU to do is still a formidable problem.

Reference-contexts: The site model supplies much of the geometric information needed to perform change detection; however, even in this case the object models are not detailed enough to reduce the problem to simple feature matching <ref> [HoogsBajcsy94] </ref>. One of the major problems in performing model-supported change detection is that the change to be detected is not predictable or modeled.
