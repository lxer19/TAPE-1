Reference-contexts: The straightforward approach is to use the transformation method described in [103, page 200]. A desired PRN can be generated from a transformation of uniform U <ref> [0; 1] </ref> deviates, if the cumulative distribution function is known. The requirement here is the ability to compute the modified Bessel function K for fractional values of in general. Numerical Recipes [103] and Abramowitz and Stegun [1] offer approximating formulas only for integer and half-integer -'s. <p> A desired PRN can be generated from a transformation of uniform U [0; 1] deviates, if the cumulative distribution function is known. The requirement here is the ability to compute the modified Bessel function K for fractional values of in general. Numerical Recipes [103] and Abramowitz and Stegun <ref> [1] </ref> offer approximating formulas only for integer and half-integer -'s. IMSL generalizes to fractional values of -, but their implementation is still somewhat cumbersome to use. A different approach, based on a numerical method of solving an associated Fokker-Planck equation is described in Oliver and Tough [99]. <p> The Rayleigh r.v. R is generated from the square root of the exponential E = where u ~ U <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The 2- r.v. C is similarly generated from the square root of a 2 2-, which is a special case of a gamma distributed variable G. For integer values of the function GAMDEV from [103] is found useful (after scaling with 1=b 2 ). <p> For half-integer -, G can be easily enough generated as a sum of m = 2- squared normal deviates, or (from the IMSL manual) as G = 2 ln i=1 i where u i ~ U <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and n i ~ N (0; 1). <p> Otherwise, two uniform PRN's from U <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, u 1 and u 2 , are generated and the quantity W computed W = u 1 u 1 + u 2 Moreover, an exponential T = Er (1) and an Erlang Z = Er (k) are generated, and the final gamma G is obtained from G = Z <p> For comparison, 5000 Rayleigh PRN's are also generated from a uniform U <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and the same procedure applied. dataset with thermal noise without noise - b 2 2 2 - b 2 - = 5:1 (5,000 samples) 3.744 0.411 1.340 4.661 0.459 - = 5:1 (50,000 samples) 2.614 0.352 3.610 4.996 0.487 - = 1:3 (5,000 samples) 1.247 0.481 0.066 1.297 0.490

Reference-contexts: Kinsman [65] and Phillips [101] are the classic introductory references in this area. A more recent discussion at an elementary level, of the interaction of radar/radio waves with the sea surface and near surface, is also given by Apel <ref> [2] </ref>. 2.3 Electromagnetic scattering and rough surfaces The straightforward approach to the scattering problem of microwaves from the rough sea surface is to start from Maxwell's equations, impose suitable initial and boundary conditions and then solve them.

Reference-contexts: Oliver [98] and Oliver and Tough [99] outline a method of simulating correlated K-distributed clutter, which should be closer to the real world since real clutter is indeed correlated in both time and space. Note also the recent letter by Armstrong and Griffiths <ref> [3] </ref> regarding such simulations. <p> See also the recent letter by Armstrong and Griffiths <ref> [3] </ref> where some improvements are made, in this area.

Reference-contexts: The construction of a random process with a narrow-band spectrum peaking at a frequency other than zero is also discussed and the development seems to be similar to Rayleigh's SPM. Simulations of scattering from 1-dim perfectly conducting rough surface can be found in <ref> [4, 93, 72, 46, 25] </ref> (the latter two have a good discussion on how to generate Gaussian correlated random surfaces numerically although Mitchell [84] and Ogilvy [97] were also found useful.

Reference-contexts: The individual results are then added together in the appropriate wavenumber interval and this also takes care of the wrapping. Grating lobes With d e = &gt; 0:5 grating lobes appear <ref> [5] </ref>. As an example, for the case d e = = 1:94 and M = 32 there are (Fig. B.5) three grating lobes appearing in the array factor. This gives us the array response for a plane wave impinging from angle . <p> Note that for more accurate results the directional patterns of the transmitter and receiver pyramidal horns has to be taken into account. In fact, improvement is observed, both for the grating lobe and tail-end behaviour. The standard gain horn patterns were calculated from <ref> [5, pages 565-576] </ref>). Even though no diffraction effects are included in these formulas and their derivation considers the pyramidal horn as an aperture antenna mounted on an infinite ground plane, they give accurate enough results for the purposes required here.

Reference-contexts: Together with Bahar [9] they correct Kodis [67] in deriving the expression for the quasispecular scattering cross section at high frequencies for perfectly conducting surfaces. An older paper of Barrick <ref> [6] </ref> discusses a preliminary formulation of rough surface scattering based on the specular point theory.

Reference-contexts: Extraction of statistical parameters of random surfaces from the surface spectrum (claimed to be more robust in some respects) is outlined in [107]. Bidirectional scattering by [69]. A precise quantitative relationship <ref> [7] </ref> between the roughness heights and the winds for the longer higher gravity waves is complicated by several factors. <p> They show that the wave spectrum is closer to being isotropic than the cosine-squared directionality assumed in the Neumann-Pierson and also some small deviations from normality and Gaussianity. Barrick <ref> [7, 8] </ref> develops an effective surface impedance model for wave propagation over the sea, applicable for EM waves in the MHz range (HF and VHF). He points out [8] that at microwave frequencies the ocean sea surface is "composite" and thus more difficult to analyze.

Reference-contexts: For low elevation targets the glistening surface extends essentially to the horizon, and energy from the more distant portions of the surface is subject to multiple scattering by intervening surface features (shadowing Chapter 2: Theoretical Background 9 phenomenon). Barton <ref> [11, 12] </ref> emphasizes the existence of a horizon component based on the observation that, small variations in elevation angle of the receiver antenna, correspond to larger scattering areas near the horizon, which results in a larger amount of power received.

Reference-contexts: Most of this energy appears in the forward direction (due mostly to capillary waves from the sea surface; and small discontinuities - order of wavelength from land surfaces, including twigs and vegetation). Most of the forward scattered energy (for slightly to medium rough surfaces) <ref> [12, 16] </ref>, appears to originate from the glistening surface (similar to the Fresnel zones) according to a normally distributed surface facet model. Scattering is done by the tilted facets and the glistening surface is a function of Xmtr/Rcvr geometry and surface properties, such as roughness and correlation distance. <p> For low elevation targets the glistening surface extends essentially to the horizon, and energy from the more distant portions of the surface is subject to multiple scattering by intervening surface features (shadowing Chapter 2: Theoretical Background 9 phenomenon).

Reference-contexts: The scattering of EM waves from a randomly rough surface has been studied extensively for a number of years <ref> [16, 13, 97] </ref>. Of the many theories that have been proposed, there are two that are most widely used. The Kirchhoff, also called Physical Optics or tangent plane approximation and the small perturbation method (SPM). <p> The implication is, that for backscattering, the theory is better for large angles of incidence and is expected to perform poorly for the smaller ones. Bass and Fuks <ref> [13] </ref> note that for the forward scattering case the limits of validity should be larger. Indeed, an excellent experiment on rough surface scattering (of laser light from carefully prepared material samples) conducted by O'Donnell and Mendez [96] in 1987, supports the above claim.
