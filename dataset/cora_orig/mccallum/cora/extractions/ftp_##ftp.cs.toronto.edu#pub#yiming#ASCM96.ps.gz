Reference-contexts: In this situation, we must use other methods to approximately calculate the area and volume. One simple method for calculating the plane area is the "square grid method" <ref> [4] </ref> [7]. The "square grid method" has the following property: the error of the "square grid" method is bounded by the length of the boundary of the region. <p> Hua and Wang <ref> [4] </ref> also described three practical ways of measuring the volume: the Baymah Formula, the truncated-cone method, and the trapezoid-method. These volumetric methods are simple but the errors are large and not evaluated. In this paper, we propose much more accurate and efficient methods of measuring the area and volume.

Reference-contexts: This constraint can be used in practice to increase the accuracy of the measurement. It is interesting to point out that a similar result can be obtained for the method proposed in <ref> [5] </ref> and [6] for calculating the length of a space curve. We describe the result here. Suppose OP is a space curve.

Reference-contexts: Then the bound s l El 2 (1) holds if l is small enough. Here the constant E is given by E = 8 ( 4 max + 3 000 and K max is maximum curvature on G. This proposition is first proved in <ref> [6] </ref> and [9], where the authors derive an important property in calculating the length of a space curve without analytical expression. However, the error of the method is not evaluated, because the condition that s must satisfy for 2.1 to hold is unknown. <p> It can also be used to evaluate the error of the method in calculating the curve length proposed in <ref> [6] </ref> and [9]. 3.
