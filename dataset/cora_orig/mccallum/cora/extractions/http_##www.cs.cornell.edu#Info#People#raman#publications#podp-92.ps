Abstract: Modern use has emphasized the written/printed nature of documents to the extent that today documents imply writing on paper. This trend is well reflected by document processing systems that can produce high quality paper output. The world of electronic documents currently abounds with a plethora of markup languages, document encodings and typesetting systems designed to facilitate the production of visual documents. In the process, the principal function of the document as a vehicle of information has been overlooked. Our work considers an alternative view of the document, namely the audio view. Attempting to produce audio documents in a scientific manner has shown up several interesting questions in the theory of document processing. We regard the process of producing a physical document as the application of formatting rules to a high-level representation of the document. Visual formatting uses its own set of rules. To generate audio documents, we need to apply audio rendering rules instead. Capturing two-dimensional document content, such as mathematical formulae, and rendering it in audio forms a major part of our work. The principle focus of this paper is the high-level representations that we need in order to generate audio documents. Our goal is to generate audio documents with little extra effort from the same electronic source used to produce visual documents. An audio document generated from the electronic source used to typeset this printed copy is available.

Reference-contexts: The approach used by this program revealed several shortcomings and pointed the way ahead. 2 Simple string substitution. T E XT A LK carried out simple string substitution on the linear representation of the document as embodied in the L a T E X <ref> [Lam86] </ref> source. This approach works only locally and is incapable of handling nested constructs. In addition, string substitution has severe limitations when it comes to handling examples that are context sensitive. Consider for instance the following nave substitution rule for reading integrals.
