Title: The Role of Generic Models in Conceptual Change

Abstract: 1 This research was funded in part by NSF Grant No. IRI-92-10925 and in part by ONR Grant No. N00014-92-J-1234. We thank John Clement for the use of his protocol transcript, James Greeno for his contribution to developing our constructive modeling interpretation of it, and Ryan Tweney for his helpful comments Todd W. Griffith, Nancy J. Nersessian, and Ashok Goel Abstract We hypothesize generic models to be central in conceptual change in science. This hypothesis has its origins in two theoretical sources. The first source, constructive modeling, derives from a philosophical theory that synthesizes analyses of historical conceptual changes in science with investigations of reasoning and representation in cognitive psychology. The theory of constructive modeling posits generic mental models as productive in conceptual change. The second source, adaptive modeling, derives from a computational theory of creative design. Both theories posit situation independent domain abstractions, i.e. generic models. Using a constructive modeling interpretation of the reasoning exhibited in protocols collected by John Clement (1989) of a problem solving session involving conceptual change, we employ the resources of the theory of adaptive modeling to develop a new computational model, ToRQUE. Here we describe a piece of our analysis of the protocol to illustrate how our synthesis of the two theories is being used to develop a system for articulating and testing ToRQUE. The results of our research show how generic modeling plays a central role in conceptual change. They also demonstrate how such an interdisciplinary synthesis can provide significant insights into scientific reasoning.

Reference-contexts: The generic models are abstracted from the SBF device representations of a known design situation, indexed by the functional/behavioral abstractions, and stored in memory. Given a new design situation, the stored generic models are accessed and instantiated to help create SBF representations for the new situation. The IDEAL system <ref> (Bhatta & Goel 1993) </ref> instantiates the extended theory of adaptive modeling.

Reference-contexts: We interpret much of the research in expert physics problem solving as demonstrating this <ref> (see for example Chi et al ., 1981) </ref>. Further, we believe generic models facilitate analogical retrieval, mapping, and adaptation in the constructive modeling process. This is exemplified in the psychological literature by Holyoak and collaborators (see for example Gick & Holyoak 1983).

This is exemplified in the psychological literature by Holyoak and collaborators <ref> (see for example Gick & Holyoak 1983) </ref>. Through the mediation of generic models, knowledge from multiple domains can be brought to bear on a problem and can be transformed to such an extent that something truly novel emerges, as is the case in conceptual change.

Reference-contexts: In an independent line of research, Goel and collaborators have developed an AI theory of conceptual design of physical devices that views device design as model construction and adaptation . This theory, called adaptive modeling , arose from work on the Kritik project <ref> (Goel 1991) </ref>. A designer's comprehension of the functioning of a known device is represented in the form of a structure-behavior-function (SBF) model that provides a functional and causal explanation of how the structure of the device delivers its functions.

Reference-contexts: Goel has developed a theory of generic models in the context of design <ref> (see Stroulia & Goel 1992 and Bhatta & Goel 1993) </ref>. In his work, generic models are learned from specific domain experiences and are used for analogical transfer across design domains (Section 5).
