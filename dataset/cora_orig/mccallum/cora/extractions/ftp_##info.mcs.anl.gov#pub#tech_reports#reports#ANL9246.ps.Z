Abstract: Mathematics and Computer Science Division Report ANL-92/46 December 1992 ABSTRACT BlockSolve is a software library for solving large, sparse systems of linear equations on massively parallel computers. The matrices must be symmetric, but may have an arbitrary sparsity structure. BlockSolve is a portable package that is compatible with several different message-passing pardigms. This report gives detailed instructions on the use of BlockSolve in applications programs.

Reference-contexts: It runs on a variety of parallel architectures and can easily be ported to others. BlockSolve utilizes the Chameleon package [3] to achieve portability across architectures and compatibility with message-passing paradigms such as p4 <ref> [1] </ref> and PVM [8], as well as the message-passing primitives available on architectures such as the Intel iPSC/860.

Reference-contexts: For basic information on these algorithms, we refer the reader to <ref> [2] </ref>. One important note is that the SYMMLQ algorithm requires a positive definite preconditioner, and this requirement can be a serious limitation if the matrix being solved is very indefinite. 1 The user has the option of selecting a combination of four preconditioners.
