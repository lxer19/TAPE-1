Abstract: Given a square matrix and single right and left starting vectors, the classical nonsymmetric Lanczos process generates two sequences of bior-thogonal basis vectors for the right and left Krylov subspaces induced by the given matrix and vectors. In this paper, we propose a Lanczos-type algorithm that extends the classical Lanczos process for single starting vectors to multiple starting vectors. Given a square matrix and two blocks of right and left starting vectors, our algorithm generates two sequences of biorthogonal basis vectors for the right and left block Krylov subspaces induced by the given data. The algorithm can handle the most general case of right and left block Krylov subspaces with arbitrary sizes of the starting blocks, while all previously proposed extensions of the Lanczos process are restricted to right and left starting blocks of identical sizes. Other features of our algorithm include a built-in deflation procedure to detect and delete linearly dependent or almost linearly dependent vectors in the block Krylov sequences, and the option to employ look-ahead in order to avoid the potential breakdowns that are typical for nonsymmetric Lanczos-type methods.

Reference-contexts: It was then that we decided to write this joint paper. However, we would like to stress that the algorithm presented in this paper has evolved quite a bit from the earlier versions we had in 1994. Finally, we note that, in his doctoral thesis <ref> [1] </ref>, Aliaga investigated variants of the algorithm that are tailored to parallel computers.

Reference-contexts: We remark that early versions of the Lanczos-type algorithm described in this paper had been developed independently by Aliaga, Boley, and Hernandez, and by Freund, and were presented by Boley <ref> [2] </ref> and Freund [16] at the same Oberwolfach meeting in 1994. It was then that we decided to write this joint paper. However, we would like to stress that the algorithm presented in this paper has evolved quite a bit from the earlier versions we had in 1994.
