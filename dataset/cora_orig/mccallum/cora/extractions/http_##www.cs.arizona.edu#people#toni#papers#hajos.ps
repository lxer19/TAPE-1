Abstract: The Hajos Calculus is a simple, nondeterministic procedure which generates the class of non-3-colorable graphs. Mansfield and Welsch [MW] posed the question of whether there exist graphs which require exponential-sized Hajos constructions. Unless N P 6= coN P , there must exist graphs which require exponential-sized constructions, but to date, little progress has been made on this question, despite considerable effort. In this paper, we prove that the Hajos Calculus generates polynomial-sized constructions for all non-3-colorable graphs if and only if Extended Frege systems are polynomially bounded. Extended Frege systems are a very powerful family of proof systems for proving tautologies, and proving superpolynomial lower bounds for these systems is a long-standing, important problem in logic and complexity theory. We also establish a relationship between a complete subsystem of the Hajos Calculus, and bounded-depth Frege systems; this enables us to prove exponential lower bounds on this subsystem of the Hajos Calculus.

Reference-contexts: G 0 contains two copies of each vertex other than vertex v 3 ; by contracting vertices v and v fl (using rule 3), we obtain the desired graph, G. 2 Definition. Let the graph system HC be the system HC without the Contraction rule. In <ref> [Be, pp. 352-353] </ref>, it is shown that HC is complete. The proof actually shows the stronger result that HC is complete. The following theorem is a a new and stronger form of completeness for HC than in the earlier proof by Hajos.

Reference-contexts: The following basic simulation result was proved by Cook [C]. Theorem 29 If F is provable in P V , then every F n has a proof in EF 2 of polynomial size. In later work, Buss considered more general systems of feasibly constructive mathematics <ref> [Bu2] </ref>. In particular, he investigated a system of bounded arithmetic, S 1 2 , based on classical predicate logic, and containing an induction scheme restricted to N P predicates. <p> If a primitive function symbol is added to S 1 2 for each polynomial-time function and predicate, together with appropriate defining equations for each such function and predicate, then the resulting system is a conservative extension of Cook's P V <ref> [Bu2] </ref>. This result shows that the notion of "feasibly constructive proof" is robust. The above theorem has important consequences for proving lower bounds for HC. Let us suppose that we have chosen a fixed method of encoding graphs as binary numbers.

Reference-contexts: If G is a Frege system, the system which results from G by adding the renaming rule will be denoted by RG. It is a surprising result of Buss <ref> [Bu4] </ref> that in the context of Frege systems the renaming rule is as powerful as the f0; 1g-substitution rule (up to a polynomial). Lemma 7 The system RF 2 p-simulates S 0;1 F 2 . Proof. The proof presented here is due to Steve Cook.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, a proof of a mathematical theorem is feasibly constructive if it involves only feasible predicates, and the logical reasoning in the proof involves only feasibly computable functions. (Here we are using the common identification of "feasible" with "polynomial-time computable".) In a seminal paper <ref> [C] </ref>, Cook introduced a free-variable system of arithmetic, P V , which contains a primitive symbol for every polynomial-time function and predicate, together with a rule of induction on notation. Boolean connectives are included, but not quantifiers. <p> If in addition F is provable in P V , then even stronger consequences follow. The following basic simulation result was proved by Cook <ref> [C] </ref>. Theorem 29 If F is provable in P V , then every F n has a proof in EF 2 of polynomial size. In later work, Buss considered more general systems of feasibly constructive mathematics [Bu2].

Reference-contexts: We shall also consider Extended Frege systems, in which it is possible to introduce new sentence letters as abbreviations for complex formulas. For a more in-depth treatment of propositional proof systems and their relative efficiency, see <ref> [CR] </ref>. Let P be a fixed propositional proof system. We say that P is sound if all of its axioms are tautologies, and its rules of inference preserve truth (for each truth assignment). <p> Such a system is an Extended Frege system. Cook and Reckhow <ref> [CR] </ref> show that any two Extended Frege systems are p-equivalent, so that the results of this paper do not depend on the formal details of a particular system. <p> The new derivation d 0 can be constructed in polynomial time from the old derivation d, so that EF 2 p-simulates E S. This proof is essentially the same as the proof by Cook and Reckhow <ref> [CR] </ref> of the corresponding result for Extended resolution. 2 7 3.4 Systems with substitution rules Another natural and powerful rule used in many propositional proof systems is the the rule of substitution: &gt;From A derive A [B=p], where p is a variable, B any formula. <p> If G is a Frege system, then we write SG for the system which results from G by adding the rule of substitution. Such systems are called Frege systems with substitution by Cook and Reckhow <ref> [CR] </ref>, who prove that any such system can p-simulate any Extended Frege system. 2 A weak form of the substitution rule is the rule which allows the substitution of the constants 0 and 1 for all occurrences of a propositional variable.

Reference-contexts: Garey, Johnson and Stockmeyer <ref> [GJS] </ref> showed that 3SAT is reducible to 3-Colorability, by obtaining a polynomial-time, many-one transformation from 3CN F formulas to graphs. Here, we slightly modify their construction so that it is a transformation from arbitrary CN F formulas to graphs. <p> The observation leads to the following lemma, which was proven in <ref> [GJS] </ref>. <p> Let f = C 1 ^ C 2 ^ :: ^ C q be a CNF formula, with underlying variables fx 1 ; :::; x n g. The proof follows the basic idea behind the <ref> [GJS] </ref> proof that if Graph (f ) is non-3-colorable, then f is unsatisfiable. We will define a particular coloring for Graph (f ), based on the propositional variables fx 1 ; :::; x n g.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Hajos calculus (or Hajos construction) is a simple, nondeterministic procedure for generating the class of graphs that are not k-colorable <ref> [Haj] </ref>. 1 Mansfield and Welsh [MW] have posed the problem of determining the complexity of this procedure; in particular, it is an open problem whether or not there exists a polynomial-size Hajos construction for every non-3-colorable graph. <p> The simulating construction which results has size O (jv (G)j 2 ), so the systems with and without the duplication rule are p-equivalent. It is not too hard to see that any graph constructed by means of the above Hajos calculus procedure is not 3-colorable. Moreover Hajos showed <ref> [Haj] </ref> that the Hajos calculus is complete. The proof of this completeness theorem yields an algorithm which generates a Hajos construction for any non-3-colorable graph. The length of the construction, in the worst case, is exponential in the size of the graph.
