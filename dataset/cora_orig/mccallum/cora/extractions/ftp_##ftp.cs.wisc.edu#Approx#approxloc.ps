Abstract: Approximation orders of shift-invariant subspaces of L p (IR d ), 2 p 1, generated by the shifts of one compactly supported function are considered. In that course, explicit approximation maps are constructed. The approach avoids quasi-interpolation and applies to stationary and non-stationary refinements. The general results are specialized to box spline spaces, to obtain new results on their approximation orders.

Reference-contexts: The standard method for converting the information about these zeros into approximation order results is the polynomial reproduction / quasi-interpolation argument; (cf. the book [C], the survey <ref> [B] </ref>, and the references therein). However, several important PSI spaces that were introduced and studied in recent years do not satisfy the requirements imposed above on the PSI space. One difficulty arises in the area of radial basis functions, since there the typical generator is not compactly supported.

Reference-contexts: In retrospect, it seems that the quasi-interpolation approach fails to realize the approximation order of general PSI spaces, a fortiori of general SI spaces. 1 New approaches that circumvent quasi-interpolation were recently developed in [BR2] (p = 1) and <ref> [BDR1] </ref> (p = 2). While the two methods differ in the approximation scheme they employ as well as in their error analysis, they both perform the entire error analysis on the Fourier domain, hence, in turn, avoid the imposition of decay rates on the generator . <p> Also, importantly, both characterizations do not require fS h g h to be stationary, and, furthermore, <ref> [BDR1] </ref> even dispense with the regularity assumption b (0) 6= 0. Extensive discussions of the various applications of the results of [BR2] and [BDR1] to radial function approximation can be found in x3 of [BR2] and [R3] respectively. Further discussion of the literature can be found in x3.2. <p> Also, importantly, both characterizations do not require fS h g h to be stationary, and, furthermore, <ref> [BDR1] </ref> even dispense with the regularity assumption b (0) 6= 0.

[K] focuses on stationary refinements, and attempts to impose as mild as possible decay conditions on the generator . <p> We stress, however, that examples of this type are the exception rather than the rule. The only reference that we are aware of which treats the approximation order provided by M ffi; for a rational ffi and general is <ref> [BR2] </ref>, where approximation in 1-norm is considered.

Reference-contexts: Further, more recently, it was shown in <ref> [R2] </ref> (L 1 -norm) and [BDR1] (L 2 -norm) that whenever is compactly supported and b (0) 6= 0 (which is certainly the case for a polynomial box spline = M ) the polynomials in S (M ) characterize the unconstrained approximation order (i.e., the one defined and analyzed in the <p> This local approximation order of H (M ) is then converted to lower bounds on the approximation orders via the quasi-interpolation argument (for this argument, in the exponential case, see [DR], [LJ], <ref> [R2] </ref>, [BR1] and [CW]). However, in contrast with the stationary case, there is no general theory that can be applied to the exponential box spline to show that the lower bounds obtained by quasi-interpolation are the best approximation orders. <p> In contrast, the error analysis of [BR2] cannot be adopted here: that analysis makes use of the optimal approximation to the exponential functions e : x 7! e ix ; 2 IR d of <ref> [R2] </ref>, and synthesize those optimal approximations on the Fourier domain to yield optimal approximation to other smooth functions. However, when p &lt; 1 the above exponentials are not in L p any more, hence the [BR2] approach cannot go through.

Reference-contexts: Extensive discussions of the various applications of the results of [BR2] and [BDR1] to radial function approximation can be found in x3 of [BR2] and <ref> [R3] </ref> respectively. Further discussion of the literature can be found in x3.2. In the present paper, we revisit PSI spaces generated by compactly supported functions (such spaces were coined local in [BDR2]).

Reference-contexts: Another proof of that result is included in the subsequent work of Dahmen and Micchelli, [DM1]. The characterization of the approximation order of a polynomial box spline associated with a general ffi was only recently established in <ref> [RS] </ref>, where, again, the main result is concerned with the identification of the polynomials in S (M ). <p> Instead, we use here the following identity (4:1) ff2ZZ d X fl (e fi g); which is valid for any compactly supported distribution provided that g is sufficiently smooth, say, g 2 C 1 (IR d ) (cf. Theorem 2.6 of <ref> [RS] </ref>). The convergence of the right hand side of (4.1) is valid in the topology of tempered distributions (and in most circumstances, in much stronger topologies), provided that g and all its derivatives grow no faster than polynomially at 1. Proof of Theorem 2.6.

Reference-contexts: For some time, the analysis of approximation orders of PSI spaces was largely dominated by the Strang-Fix conditions, <ref> [SF] </ref>. <p> We mention that such results (concerning simultaneous approximation from SI spaces) are a rarity, especially since there is no standard way to derive them from quasi-interpolation arguments. The most notable exception is <ref> [SF] </ref> that states such results in the L 2 and L 1 -norm (for the stationary case), and proves the L 2 -statement. 5 Theorem 2.9. <p> As mentioned before, the problem of the former case is stationary, i.e., the spaces fS h g are all obtained from the original space S (M ) by dilation, and there is a variety of papers (including, but not restricted to, <ref> [SF] </ref>, [DM1,2], [BJ], and [JL]) which treat such setting for a general compactly supported , and links restrictive (hence stronger) notions of approximation order (known as "controlled" and "local") to the polynomials in S (M ).
