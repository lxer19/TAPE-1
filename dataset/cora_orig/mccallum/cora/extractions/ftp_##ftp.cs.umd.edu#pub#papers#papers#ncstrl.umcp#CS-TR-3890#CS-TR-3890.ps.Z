Abstract: Summary In this work we calculate the eigenvalues obtained by preconditioning the discrete Helmholtz operator with Sommerfeld-like boundary conditions on a rectilinear domain, by a related operator with boundary conditions that permit the use of fast solvers. The main innovation is that the eigenvalues for two and three-dimensional domains can be calculated exactly by solving a set of one-dimensional eigenvalue problems. This permits analysis of quite large problems. For grids fine enough to resolve the solution for a given wave number, preconditioning using Neumann boundary conditions yields eigenval-ues that are uniformly bounded, located in the first quadrant, and outside the unit circle. In contrast, Dirichlet boundary conditions yield eigenvalues that approach zero as the product of wave number with the mesh size is decreased. These eigenvalue properties yield the first insight into the behavior of iterative methods such as GMRES applied to these preconditioned problems.

Reference-contexts: Discretization of the problem (1)-(2) results in a linear system of equations Au = f: (3) where A is typically complex, non-Hermitian, indefinite, and in two or three dimensions, very large and sparse. In <ref> [1] </ref>, we developed a set of preconditioning techniques for this problem in the three-dimensional case, and we demonstrated their effectiveness in a collection of numerical experiments on benchmark problems. <p> The purpose of this paper is to introduce a methodology for computing the eigenvalues of various preconditioned operators associated with (3), and to use the computed eigenvalues to help explain the performance of the ideas presented in <ref> [1] </ref>. The approach under consideration for preconditioning derives from perturbation of the boundary conditions leading to A. <p> This enables the identification of the eigenvalues of the higher-dimensional problems, a task that would otherwise be compu-tationally intractable for fine grids, especially in the three dimensional case. Using these computed values, we demonstrate a correlation between the performance of the various preconditioners as presented in <ref> [1] </ref> and the spectral properties of the preconditioned operators. Manteuffel and Parter [8] and Joubert, Manteuffel, Parter, and Wong [6] have proven a very interesting series of results about problems similar to ours. <p> In this section, we explore the correlation between the spectra of the preconditioned operators AM 1 and the performance of GMRES (m), the restarted GMRES algorithm with restarts every m steps. We first present one table from <ref> [1] </ref>, showing iteration counts of GMRES (20) (restarts every twenty steps), for three-dimensional preconditioned Helmholtz problems (8) with various values of wave number k and mesh size n, and both Dirichlet and Neumann precondi-tioners. (Entries above the jagged line correspond to problems with at least ten grid points per wave.) The <p> This explains Figure 13, which shows the history of residual norms and indicates that roughly the same number (1.8) of cycles is needed to solve this problem with these two preconditioners and restart parameters. Finally, we note that we also observed in <ref> [1] </ref> that when the Dirich-let preconditioner was used to solve problems with a nonsmooth solution, the sensitivity to mesh refinement was considerably less pronounced than when the solution is smooth (as in Table 1). We have Eigenanalysis of Some Preconditioned Helmholtz Problems 25 Fig. 10.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the preconditioners are discretizations of the same differential operator but with different boundary conditions on two of the four edges of the unit square. This approach was first developed in <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These results are largely consistent with the iterative performance. We explore these trends further in Figures 8 and 9. Let p m now denote the iteration polynomial generated by m steps of GMRES. It Eigenanalysis of Some Preconditioned Helmholtz Problems 23 is shown in <ref> [3] </ref> that the roots of this polynomial are the eigenvalues of the matrix ( ~ H fl 1 m H m ) ; where H m is the rectangular upper Hessenberg matrix of dimension (m + 1) fi m generated by m steps of the Arnoldi computation used for GMRES [10]

Reference-contexts: low-rank operator (depending only on the number of grid points on the boundary), many of the eigenvalues of the preconditioned operator will be identically one, and therefore we expect good performance of Eigenanalysis of Some Preconditioned Helmholtz Problems 3 Krylov minimization or projection methods such as GMRES [10] or QMR <ref> [4] </ref>. Thus, we seek an understanding of the nonunit eigenvalues of M 1 A. The methodology presented here is to examine the eigen-values of one-dimensional versions of these preconditioned problems, and then to bootstrap these results into expressions for eigenvalues for problems in two or three dimensions.

Reference-contexts: Note that this mesh size is generally considered to be too coarse for this value of k, since it has fewer than ten grid points per wavelength; the usual rule is to keep k 2=(10h) <ref> [5] </ref>. 3.2 Preconditioning using Dirichlet boundary conditions If we construct the preconditioning matrix using Dirichlet boundary conditions on two sides of the domain, the situation is similar. Multiplication by the matrix F corresponds to a discrete inverse sine transform, and multiplication by F fl corresponds to a discrete sine transform.

Reference-contexts: They also show results on the H 1 condition number. Unfortunately, these beautiful results do not directly yield insight into the behavior of iterative methods such as GMRES and QMR; see, for example, <ref> [9] </ref>. The first two statements say that the singular values of AM 1 and those of M 1 A can behave quite differently.
