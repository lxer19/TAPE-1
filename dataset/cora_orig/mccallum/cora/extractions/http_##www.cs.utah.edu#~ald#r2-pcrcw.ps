Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The work presented here is a natural extension of previous work on a high performance router called the Post Office. The Post Office is a 300,000 transistor CMOS chip that is used to form the interconnect fabric for a prototype scalable parallel multiprocessing system called Mayfly <ref> [Davis92] </ref>. The Mayfly processing element (PE) architecture was designed to hide communication latency and hence the Post Office was designed primarily with the goal of providing a high capacity fabric. The current interest is to create multicomputer systems that are based on more conventional PE and operating system architectures. <p> Each node in the surface is uniquely identified by an integer 3-tuple &lt; X; Y; Z &gt;. The labelling scheme and the method for computing the route from an absolute address contained in the packet header is described in <ref> [Davis92] </ref>. It is important to note that for most of the possible sender receiver pairs there are multiple best paths due to the choice of a 2D hexagonal mesh topology, as well as two no-farther path options. No-farther paths neither decrease or increase the distance to the receiver.

Reference-contexts: The primary interest of this work is the development of the appropriate streamlined protocol, operating system and API interfaces, the FIC functionality, and the R2 switch. 2.4 The R2 Switch All normal packets are adaptively routed using virtual cut-through <ref> [Fujimoto83] </ref> from their inbound port to the desired output port. Priority packets always proceed on best path routes only. The availability of multiple best path routes still provides some freedom from strict deterministic routing delays caused by hot-spot contention.

Reference-contexts: If a priority packet arrives and all best path routes are occupied by priority traffic then the packet waits its turn to be forwarded. A backpressure mechanism is necessary to avoid persistent saturation of any network <ref> [Jain92] </ref>. This backpressure signal is used to throttle the rate at which packets can be injected into the interconnect fabric. Increasing the amount of buffering in the fabric increases the capacity of the network.

Reference-contexts: The FIC connects to the main-memory bus of the PB and provides a DMA capability that is consistent with a particular sender based message protocol <ref> [Swanson94] </ref>. Details of this protocol are suppressed here due to the focus on the R2 switch but the important aspect of this protocol is that each sender owns a portion of memory in each receiver.

Reference-contexts: An additional requirement of this effort is the need to support a certain level of fault tolerance.
