Abstract: UPMAIL Technical Report No. 97 Abstract Natural cycletrees, formally defined in this report, is a subclass of Hamiltonian graphs with maximum degree 3 that contain a binary spanning tree. A natural cycletree used as an interconnection network thus supports directly broadcasting through the binary tree as well as nearest-neighbour communication through the cycle. Natural cycle-trees have several other interesting properties, e.g., they are planar, easily extensible and can be contracted using the same methods as for binary trees. The two main results of the paper are: (i) Given an arbitrary basic binary spanning tree, there exists a natural cycletree with a minimal number of edges. (ii) Given a set of vertices, we present an algorithm for constructing a natural cycletree such that it has a minimal number of edges, its binary spanning tree has the minimal total path length and its structure satisfies a given abstract specification. For example, if we wish to construct a natural cycletree connecting k processing elements, we could invoke the algorithm with a set of k distinct vertices and a simple specification (provided as an example in the paper).

Reference-contexts: Some parameters that are commonly used to char acterize networks are: number of edges, degree of the network (maximum degree of the nodes), diameter (the largest distance between any two nodes), average distance, symmetry, edge- and node connectivities, extensibility, and reliability <ref> [1, 2, 7, 38, 39, 50] </ref>. 1 In this paper, the following parameters are treated as the most important, in the order given. 1. Minimal degree. When using an interconnection network for communication between computation nodes, the number of physical communication ports of each node is usually limited. <p> The edges represented by straight lines form a basic binary tree. The dashed lines represent edges that are not part of the cycle. The curved lines represent edges that are not part of the basic binary tree.

Reference-contexts: Some parameters that are commonly used to char acterize networks are: number of edges, degree of the network (maximum degree of the nodes), diameter (the largest distance between any two nodes), average distance, symmetry, edge- and node connectivities, extensibility, and reliability <ref> [1, 2, 7, 38, 39, 50] </ref>. 1 In this paper, the following parameters are treated as the most important, in the order given. 1. Minimal degree. When using an interconnection network for communication between computation nodes, the number of physical communication ports of each node is usually limited. <p> Let us now turn to the more practical issue of using natural cycletrees as in 18 terconnection graphs in the MP-RAM model, see for example Almasi and Gottlieb <ref> [2] </ref> for a formal treatment of the various computational models. We will present an algorithm that recursively configures a natural cycletree from a given collection of nodes. We will think of our RAMs simply as nodes. <p> For an overview of other static and dynamic connection topologies see, e.g., Almasi and Gottlieb <ref> [2] </ref>. Our main reason for introducing cycletrees is to support pipeline communication and broadcasting from (or collecting data to) a specific node, i.e., the two communication patterns mentioned in the introduction.

The same contracted graph is obtained, since the nontree edges occur only locally within each "supervertex" at the leaf level.

Reference-contexts: The natural cycletree in Figure 11 satisfies this constraint and is, for example, the interconnection graph of the cyclic-order odd-even transposition bilinear sorter <ref> [26] </ref>. We needed neither the mark nor the level in the simple examples 6.1 and 6.2. Using the mark and the level is more powerful and one can define a `split' that yields, for example, a path-minimal natural cycletree. This is illustrated with the next example.

Reference-contexts: An inductively defined class of graphs that we call natural cycletrees, is introduced. Figure 2 illustrates a natural cycletree. It is shown that 1. natural cycletrees indeed belong to the class of cycletrees; 2. the degree of every nontrivial natural cycletree is three; 3. the class of ringtrees <ref> [52] </ref> is strictly contained by the class of natural cycletrees; 1 In fact, our first application of natural cycletrees was as an interconnection network between Transputers on a Meiko parallel computer. 2 are not part of the binary tree and the dashed lines correspond to edges that are not part of <p> As an immediate consequence we get that all full natural cycletrees are minimal, e.g., the natural cycletree in Figure 3 is minimal. This also confirms the result proved for ringtrees <ref> [52] </ref>, which are in fact full natural cycletrees. We shall first prove a lemma in which we will make use of the following definitions. Let T be a basic binary tree. <p> Then Formula 6 reduces to n 1 + b (n + 2)=3c; (7) which was also shown by Xie and Ge <ref> [52] </ref> to be the number of edges in a ringtree. One can easily verify that the natural cycletree in Figure 9 is path-minimal, by using Formula 6. We also get the following corollary from Theorem 4.6. <p> The main feature of sneptrees is that they can simulate over-sized computation trees through the additional links and are thus particularly suitable for divide-and-conquer algorithms. A deBruijn network of degree 4 is one kind of sneptree. Cyclic sneptrees contain two Hamiltonian circuits. Ringtrees. Ringtrees <ref> [52] </ref> form a special case of cycletrees, namely, full natural cycletrees. Natural cycletrees can therefore be seen as a generalization of ringtrees. A ringtree is constructed of two k-linear trees. A k-linear tree corresponds to a full natural chaintree of 2 k 1 vertices.
