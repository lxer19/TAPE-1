Title: Partitions of 2

Abstract: There are many ways that 2 n can be expressed as the sum of lower powers of 2, that is k=0 a k 2 k = 2 n , where a k is a non-negative integer. Each collection of coefficients &lt; a k &gt; is a partition of 2 n . This paper presents a way of counting the number, p n , of such partitions, which is super exponential.

Reference-contexts: While there exists at least one closure space on n points corresponding to every partition &lt; a 0 ; ; a n &gt;, it has been suggested that for the closure space to be a convex geometry <ref> [1] </ref> or an alignment [2] the empty set should be closed, or equivalently a 0 6= 0. These, therefore, correspond to normal partitions.

Reference-contexts: Such partitions arise in the study of closure spaces, where it can be shown that every closure operator ' has a trace satisfying (1), and that for any given partition of 2 n , there exists a closure operator having that sequence as its trace <ref> [3] </ref>. Several characteristics of (1) are readily apparent. First, a n 6= 0 if and only if a k = 0 for all 0 &lt; k &lt; n.
