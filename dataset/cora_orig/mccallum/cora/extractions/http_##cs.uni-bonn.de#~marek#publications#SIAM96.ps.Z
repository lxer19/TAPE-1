Abstract: We design an algorithm for computing the generalized (algebraic circuits with root extracting, cf. [P 81], [J 81], [GSY 93]) additive complexity of any rational function. It is the first computability result of this sort on the additive complexity of algebraic circuits.

In the case of one variable (n = 1) we give an (elementary) complexity bound of the designed algorithm (see theorem below) as it uses the quantifier elimination algorithm from <ref> [G 89] </ref>. <p> But the complexity of quantifier elimination is elementary in the case of ordinary differential equations for the algorithm designed in <ref> [G 89] </ref>, i. e. when n = 1, in another words when there is only one independent variable X. <p> Therefore (see the bounds in <ref> [G 89] </ref>), one can eliminate quantifiers and produce a system of polynomial equations and inequalities with integer coefficients (see above) in the unknowns ~ff (i+1) (i+1) i ; 0 i t in time N = M O (1) (degf ) 2 2 O (t 2 ) ; the degrees of the
