Abstract: Effective exploitation of meteorological archives has long been impeded by an inability to rapidly identify relevant data, and by the difficulties of managing the large volume of data involved. We present a new approach to archiving meteorological data that addresses these problems. Our approach is implemented in MetVUW Workbench, a case-based system for intelligent retrieval and display of historical meteorological data. The system is intended to serve as a "memory amplifier" for meteorologists that allows them to rapidly locate historical situations of interest. In developing MetVUW Workbench, we have addressed challenging issues of representation and retrieval of spatial information. This paper outlines our approach to some of these issues.

Reference-contexts: To address these problems, we are developing MetVUW Workbench, a system for intelligent retrieval and display of historical meteorological data <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. The system is intended to serve as an intelligent assistant for meteorologists: a kind of memory amplifier that allows meteorologists to rapidly locate and analyze historical situations of interest. Past situations are retrieved by specifying high-level descriptions of their content, using a graphical query language. <p> The entire region covered by a cluster is likely to experience adverse weather, especially near centers of low pressure. It is therefore important to encode the shape of clusters in a way that makes clear the location of regions of low pressure. 1 High-pressure systems are another matter; see <ref> [1] </ref>. 10 A cluster is represented as a tree whose leaves are simple low-pressure systems and whose internal nodes are smaller clusters.

A novel mechanism for speeding up case retrieval has also been implemented <ref> [2] </ref>. Using this mechanism, a typical query takes MetVUW Workbench on the order of a minute to process on a Sparc 10 model 30 with 64 Mb of memory, using our current case base of 2500 cases.

Reference-contexts: Case-based reasoning is an approach to problem solving in which past solutions to old problems are retrieved and adapted to solve new problems <ref> [3] </ref>. MetVUW Workbench assists in the retrieval of relevant past cases, but leaves their adaptation and interpretation to the user of the system. Each case is a slice of time for which meteorological data is available.

Reference-contexts: Case selection presupposes a suitable memory organization for index labels, and a retrieval mechanism that exploits this memory organization to efficiently access cases whose labels match a query. MetVUW Workbench uses a relational database called Postgres to implement case selection <ref> [4] </ref>. Postgres provides a number of sophisticated indexing methods, including R-tree indexing of spatial data [5]. This heavy duty machinery was chosen so that the current system will readily scale up to a very large case base.

Reference-contexts: The system employs a form of width-bounded depth-first search with successor ordering <ref> [6] </ref>. The search enumerates sets of possible correspondences between regions in the query and regions in the case and returns the best matching set of correspondences that it finds, if any. Two structural constraints are imposed on the sets of correspondences.

Reference-contexts: A procedure for case selection cannot be faulted if when using this procedure, MetVUW Workbench returns all and only the cases on the benchmark list. Two standard evaluation metrics from the information retrieval literature are useful in evaluating case selection <ref> [7] </ref>: * The precision of an information retrieval system is the percentage of items retrieved in response to a query that are good answers to the query. * The recall of an information retrieval system is the proportion of good answers to a query that the system retrieved, expressed as a
