Abstract: Concept learning is one of the most studied areas in machine learning. A lot of work in this domain deals with decision trees. In this paper, we are concerned with a different kind of technique based on Galois lattices or concept lattices. We present a new semi-lattice based system, IGLUE, that uses the entropy function with a top-down approach to select concepts during the lattice construction. Then IGLUE generates new relevant numerical features by transforming initial boolean features over these concepts. IGLUE uses the new features to redescribe examples. Finally, IGLUE applies the Mahanalobis distance as a similarity measure between examples. Keywords : Multistrategy Learning, Instance-Based Learning, Galois lattice, Feature transformation

This paper deals with one of these systems, namely LEGAL [MN94], and focuses on such system in order to improve both its efficiency and its computational complexity in case of real-world applications, and to facilitate its usage in practice. LEGAL needs two user-specified learning parameters to achieve the concept formation process. These parameters have two major drawbacks.
