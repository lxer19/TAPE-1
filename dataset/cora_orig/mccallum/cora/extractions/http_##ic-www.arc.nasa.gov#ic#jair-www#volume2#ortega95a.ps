Abstract: The DNA promoter sequences domain theory and database have become popular for testing systems that integrate empirical and analytical learning. This note reports a simple change and reinterpretation of the domain theory in terms of M-of-N concepts, involving no learning, that results in an accuracy of 93.4% on the 106 items of the database. Moreover, an exhaustive search of the space of M-of-N domain theory interpretations indicates that the expected accuracy of a randomly chosen interpretation is 76.5%, and that a maximum accuracy of 97.2% is achieved in 12 cases. This demonstrates the informativeness of the domain theory, without the complications of understanding the interactions between various learning algorithms and the theory. In addition, our results help characterize the difficulty of learning using the DNA promoters theory.

Reference-contexts: The second piece of domain knowledge is that the concepts in this domain tend to take the form of M-of-N concepts. Some of the final rules extracted in the KBANN approach take this form. This was also made clear in the NEITHER-MofN system <ref> (Baffes & Mooney, 1993) </ref>, which added a mechanism to handle M-of-N concepts to the original learning mechanism of the EITHER/NEITHER system. 3. <p> As shown in Figure 2 a few random guesses allow us to do much better than that. 364 On the Informativeness of the DNA Promoter Sequences Domain Theory 4. Learning with the DNA Promoters Theory The accuracies of various systems that integrate analytical and empirical learning are around 93% <ref> (Baffes & Mooney, 1993) </ref>. These results are typically means computed over multiple trials with 80-85 training examples and 21-26 tests examples. Our reported accuracies of 93.4% and 97.2% are not based on such splits of training and test data.

Reference-contexts: The positive examples of promoters were taken from the compilation of Hawley and McClure (1983). This database has been recently augmented (Harley & Reynolds, 1987; Lisser & Margalit, 1993) and new theories of promoter action are still appearing <ref> (Lisser & Margalit, 1993) </ref>. Nevertheless, the UCI promoter sequences database of examples and domain theory has remained a prominent testbed for evaluating machine learning methods. The DNA promoters domain theory obtained from the UCI repository is shown in as a conjunction of conditions.

Reference-contexts: First, the conformation condition has very weak biological support. This was implied by the initial KBANN experiments (Shavlik et al., 1992), where none of the learned rules referenced the conformation conditions. In addition, the EITHER system <ref> (Ourston, 1991) </ref> eliminated rules involving conformation altogether from the domain theory. Eliminating conformation was also supported by a domain expert (Ourston, 1991).
