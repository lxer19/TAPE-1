Reference-contexts: The parser transforms Gypsy text into an internal form for storage in the library. The pretty printer transforms the internal form back into parsable Gypsy text. The interpreter, compiler [Smith 80] and Ada translator <ref> [Akers 83] </ref> also are fairly conventional tools for running Gypsy programs. Although the interpreter would be a very useful debugging tool, it is not well developed and it is not presently available.
