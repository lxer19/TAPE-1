Abstract: Until recently, VLSI designers rarely considered yield issues when selecting a floorplan for a newly designed chip. This paper demonstrates that for large area VLSI chips, especially those that incorporate some fault tolerance, changes in the floorplan can affect the projected yield. We study several general floorplan structures, make some specific recommendations, and apply them to actual VLSI chips. We conclude that the floorplan of a chip can affect its projected yield in a non-negligible way, for chips with or without fault-tolerance.

Reference-contexts: This is justified when the chip is relatively small and the defect distribution can be accurately described by either the Poisson or the compound Poisson yield models ([3]). In particular, in the most commonly used compound Poisson model, i.e., the negative binomial (NB) distribution with large-area clustering <ref> [4] </ref>, the "size" of the defect clusters is assumed to be much larger than the size of the chip and thus selecting a different floorplan will not affect the projected yield of the designed chip. <p> It is well known that manufacturing defects tend to cluster on the wafer, and are, therefore, better matched by a Negative Binomial (N B) distribution than by a Poisson distribution <ref> [4] </ref>. The negative binomial distribution has two parameters, and ff. <p> If, however, the area consists of two disjoint parts of sizes A 1 and A 2 , each with a different "critical area" <ref> [4] </ref> and probabilities p 1 and p 2 , respectively, of a defect becoming a fault, then P (no f aults in an area of size A 1 + A 2 ) = e A 1 p 1 lA 2 p 2 l (7) Integrating (7) over l with respect to <p> Based on the previous examples we draw the general conclusion that even in a floorplan with no redundancy (i.e, all faults are chip-kill faults <ref> [4] </ref>), if different modules have different fault densities then the relative position of the modules may have a significant impact on the yield. <p> The top two rows (out of the 66 rows) constitute the redundant cells to replace either defective rows or defective individual cells. The remaining functional units have no redundancy incorporated into them and as such, each fault occurring in them is a chip-kill fault <ref> [4] </ref>. The current floorplan as shown in Figure 14 has the D-CACHE on one side and the I-CACHE on the other side of the chip.

Reference-contexts: This situation is now changing with the introduction of integrated circuits with a total area of 2cm 2 and up. Recent studies of defect maps of very large area VLSI ICs <ref> [5] </ref> have shown that the large-area clustering N B distribution does not provide a sufficiently accurate yield model for such ICs. The newly proposed medium-area clustering model [6] provides a much better match to empirical data [5]. <p> Recent studies of defect maps of very large area VLSI ICs <ref> [5] </ref> have shown that the large-area clustering N B distribution does not provide a sufficiently accurate yield model for such ICs. The newly proposed medium-area clustering model [6] provides a much better match to empirical data [5]. Our objective is to study the possible impact that the floorplan of a large area chip (with or without redundancy) has on its yield, using the new medium-area clustering N B yield model. In this paper we report on a detailed study of the relationship between floorplanning and yield. <p> Most of the literature dealing with yield issues assumes large area clustering, i.e., large defect clusters comparable in size to the chip or even the wafer size. As has been demonstrated in <ref> [5] </ref>, the empirical defect distribution of large area chips has a better fit to a medium-area clustering than to a large-area clustering N B distribution. A detailed description of the 2 medium-area N B distribution, including several suggested ways of estimating the block size, appears in [6].

The most unique feature of its implementation is its use of stacked wafers. The basic processing element is divided into five functional units, each of which is implemented on a different wafer. <p> Thus, each wafer contains only one type of functional units and includes spares for yield enhancement as explained below. Units in different wafers are connected vertically through microbridges between adjacent wafers to form a complete processing element. The first working prototype of the 3-D computer, reported in <ref> [13] </ref>, was of size 32fi32. The current prototype includes 128fi128 processing elements. Fault-tolerance in each wafer is achieved through a (2,4) interstitial redundancy scheme [15].

Reference-contexts: However, the close proximity of the spare and primary units may lead to a low yield in the presence of clustered defects since a single cluster may cover several of these units, as has been experienced in practice <ref> [14] </ref>. There are several alternative floorplans that place the spare farther apart from the primary units connected to it (as recommended in Section 3).
