Abstract: Our Ethiopic support software runs under the standard UNIX + the X window system environment and requires no special hardware. As a result of the integration of Mule and GNU Emacs, GNU Emacs 20.1 supports these Ethiopic features by default. Porting to Windows 95 and NT is also on going.

Reference-contexts: Though independent from file I/O, SERA has been applied as the input method (IM) for Mule as well, thus much of the system has already been discussed in Section 3.2. Comprehensive and current information on SERA is available online <ref> [2] </ref>. Mule provides a very rich support of SERA and goes a little further to add typesetting intelligence to make the transliterated documents more pleasant to read. Some functions are available in the Ethiopic Mode for working with SERA buffers.

Reference-contexts: The required mapping tables are not provided with Mule but are available by ftp with example L A T E X files <ref> [5] </ref>. A sample usage of the files is presented in Appendix B. 6 Summary We have described various Mule's functions concerning the Ethiopic script. Note that all of these functions were implemented by user level extensions.
