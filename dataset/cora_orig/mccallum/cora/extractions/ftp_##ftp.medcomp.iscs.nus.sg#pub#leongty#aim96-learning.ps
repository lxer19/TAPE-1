Abstract: This paper concerns knowledge acquisition for supporting therapy decision making (TDM) within the formal setting of Markov decision processes (MDP's). It presents a method for learning from medical databases high-level transitions, transition probabilities and action rewards. The method is based state comparison. We also discuss insights in terms of what/when/why/how expert advice is needed to handle various situations where an automated learning technique may fail.
