Reference-contexts: but it has similarites to 1 There has been a recent debate about whether the place code is separate from the path integration system (McNaughton et al., 1996; Redish and Touretzky, 1997a; Samsonovich and McNaughton, 1997), but recent data has provided strong support for the separation of the two systems <ref> (Alyan et al., 1997, see EX.59) </ref>. See Chapter 6 for an in-depth discussion of this issue. CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 5 taxon/praxic navigation. It is related to memory consolidation issues often discussed in the context of hippocampal lesions (e.g. Cohen and Eichenbaum, 1993; Skaggs et al., 1996). <p> Seguinot et al. found systematic errors depending on specifics of the path taken. Other species make similar errors (Maurer and Seguinot, 1995). Reviewed Result EX.59 Rats can show path integration abilities even after hippocampal lesions <ref> (Alyan et al., 1997) </ref>. Alyan et al. (1997) tested rats in two tasks | (a) rats were lured via a circuitous route to a location in the arena from which they were allowed to return back to the nest. They went directly to the nest. <p> Samsonovich and McNaughton (1996) suggest that phase precession is a consequence of an interaction between the mechanism that drives path integration and internal neuronal dynamics. However their hypothesis that the hippocampus is necessary for path integration has been recently disproven <ref> (Alyan et al., 1997, EX.59, see also Chapter 6) </ref>. Therefore this model cannot be the whole story either. However, this doesn't disprove their phase precession mechanism, but there isn't any data supporting it, either. What mechanism produces phase precession is still an open question. Off-route asymmetries. <p> This means that shortcuts to a goal can be planned from a location only if that location lies between two previously experienced locations. The transfer experiments of Matthews et al. (1995, EX.29) belie this. Another problem with this hypothesis is that the hippocampus is not necessary for online navigation <ref> (Alyan et al., 1997) </ref>: animals can navigate back to a starting point without a hip-pocampus. <p> The fact that there is no effect at zero delay implies that rodents can perform configural associations as long as they don't have to re-instate the context. Finally, the question of path integration with hippocampal lesions has just recently been tested <ref> (Alyan et al., 1997) </ref>. As reviewed in the Experimental Review (EX.59), Alyan et al. confirmed the prediction that animals should be able to show path integrative abilities even with ibotenic lesions of the hippocampus (originally made in Redish and Touretzky, 1997a).

Reference-contexts: place cells of the hippocampus (see Experimental Review, Section 2.2.2-A) are well-suited for this role. 3.2.4-A Anatomy The hippocampus is a bilateral C-shaped structure, with one end at the septal regions dorsally (just ventral to parietal cortex) and the other at the amygdala ventrally (just medial to the entorhinal cortex) <ref> (Amaral, 1993, see Figure 3.7) </ref>. This makes it a very easy target for recording electrodes; it is both large and accessible. However, it is the internal structure of the hippocampus that has made it such a treasure trove for experimental work.

Reference-contexts: Hill (1978) reports that place cells show pretty clean fields the first time an animal passes through the field, but later studies have shown that fields can require 10-30 minutes (Wilson and McNaughton, 1993) or as much as 4 hours <ref> (Austin et al., 1993) </ref> to "tune up". Although they may show initial place fields, the place fields become more reliable and more stable over that initial exploration period (Austin et al., 1993; Wilson and McNaughton, 1993).

Reference-contexts: CHAPTER 2. EXPERIMENTAL REVIEW 27 2.1.3 The hole-board circular platform board. One hole leads to a hidden nest. The arena is bathed in bright light. In order to escape the bright light, rats try to find the hole with the nest where they can hide. The hole-board arena <ref> (introduced by Barnes, 1979) </ref> is similar to the water maze in that it forces animals to use distal cues to find an escape route from an aversive stimulus (in this case bright light). <p> Because the holes are all around the edge of the platform, it would be sufficient to know the orientation of the escape hole. Reviewed Result EX.30 Old animals show deficits in finding a hidden location in the hole-board circular platform <ref> (Barnes, 1979) </ref>. Young animals show better retention of the location of the escape hole even after a week's delay (Barnes et al., 1980). <p> Like the water maze, after switching the location of the escape tunnel, animals with a nonspatial strategy (such as check all holes randomly) will not change their time-to-goal, while animals who prefer to keep trying to use a spatial strategy will <ref> (Barnes, 1979) </ref>.

Young animals show better retention of the location of the escape hole even after a week's delay <ref> (Barnes et al., 1980) </ref>. Barnes (1979) found that both old and young animals showed three basic behavioral patterns: (1) examination of many holes with many center-crossings, (2) systematic exploration of the holes, going from one hole to the next, and (3) taking a direct path to the escape hole. <p> In other words, they could learn to go to one of the arms, but could not remember two rewards on two arms.

OPEN QUESTIONS 277 If the anatomical hypothesis and mechanism discussed in Chapter 6 is correct, then two additional neurophysiological predictions can be made.

This issue has also been examined by Knierim et al. (1995). 3.2.1-B Cue types Point landmarks. There are many examples of rodents navigating based on small objects <ref> (e.g. the cylinders in Collett et al., 1986) </ref>, but whether these are seen as single "objects" by the rodents is an open question. However, most models treat landmarks as points in space. This gives the distinct advantage that distance and bearing are easily defined. <p> Thus external and internal cues complement each other. Internal cues will be addressed in the following two sections: Head direction (HD) and Path integration (PI). 3.2.2 Head direction (HD) Because animals can use allocentric bearing in navigation <ref> (e.g. Collett et al., 1986, EX.1, see also Section 3.2.1, above) </ref>, they must have a means of calculating allocentric bearing. Allocentric bearing can be computed by measuring egocentric bearing and factoring out the animals own head direction (Equation 3.1). <p> A theory that purports to explain navigation should be able explain the different search distributions seen in response to manipulations of the landmark arrays. In this chapter, I present simulations that replicate these open-field navigation results. 14.1 Prior hypotheses 14.1.1 Vector voting <ref> (Collett et al., 1986) </ref> To account for the gerbils' behavior in their experiments, Collett et al. posited that the animals began planning their path to the goal by applying every learned landmark-to-goal vector (Figure 14.1) to all the landmarks they perceived.

Reference-contexts: The autocorrelation was found to become insignificant after approximately 100 samples (approximately 5.5 secs). We therefore subsampled all data used in subsequent analyses at a ratio of 1:100. The EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm is a general-purpose algorithm for fitting general mixtures of models to data <ref> (Dempster et al., 1977) </ref>. We used the EM algorithm to fit mixtures of Gaussians here. For stability reasons, the variances of all the Gaussians was assumed to be equal, that is, there was a single parameter which was fit by the EM algorithm. CHAPTER 2. <p> Outliers were re-included in the following Expectation step, so a data sample could be an outlier in one iteration and not in another. The quality of the fit of the 2D Gaussians to the data sample can be measured by log likelihood <ref> (Dempster et al., 1977) </ref>. We determined whether K 0 Gaussians produced a significantly better fit than K Gaussians by comparing the log likelihoods. If the increase in log likelihood was more significant than P &lt; 0:05, we used K 0 Gaussians instead of K.

Reference-contexts: hypothalamus have been implicated in emotion and goal information by a number of studies (see Aggleton, 1993, and Davis et al., 1994, for reviews), and NAcb receives afferent fibers from amygdala (Aggleton, 1993; Davis et al., 1994; Finch, 1996), the ventral tegmental area (Wolske et al., 1993), and the hypothalamus <ref> (Domesick, 1981) </ref>. NAcb also receives afferents from the medial prefrontal cortex (Sesack et al., 1989; Finch, 1996), which may supply contextual information (Kolb, 1990b). Finch (1996) has shown that many of these inputs (amygdala, hippocampal formation, medial prefrontal) all converge on single neurons in the accumbens.

The simultaneous recording of a hundred cells or so described by Wilson and McNaughton (1993) should be sufficient.

Reference-contexts: An important problem with auto-associative memories is that if the synaptic transmission continues to occur across recurrent connections when a memory is being stored in the system then incorrect correlations will occur between two memories that share neurons. This is called interference <ref> (Hasselmo and Bower, 1993) </ref>. In order to fix the problem of interference, when LTP occurs in the system (i.e. when the system is storing a memory), the recurrent connections should be ineffective.

Reference-contexts: Since the Schaffer collaterals are the same axons which form the CA3 excitatory feedback pathway, this suggests that ACh may shut off these recurrent connections. ACh also has an effect on learning: although it suppresses synaptic transmission, ACh enhances LTP in DG, CA1, and other structures <ref> (Hasselmo, 1995) </ref>. CHAPTER 2. EXPERIMENTAL REVIEW 60 Reviewed Result EX.115 Rats show normal habituation even under scopolomine (Buhot and Naili, 1995). <p> There hippocampal and catecholaminergic terminals converge on single spines (Sesack and Pickel, 1990) I am not going to review the complex effects of dopamine on cellular physiology <ref> (I refer the reader to Hasselmo, 1995, for a review) </ref>, nor will I review the anatomical structure of the basal ganglia or the involvement of dopamine therein. For this and other related issues, I refer the reader to Houk et al. (1995). <p> Returning to the conceptual framework above, we can say that ACh turns off pattern completion while not affecting pattern separation. ACh also has an effect on learning: although it suppresses synaptic transmission, ACh enhances LTP in DG, CA1, and other structures <ref> (see Hasselmo, 1995, for a review) </ref>. This means that ACh should enhance the learning and separation of place codes. 3.2.5 Goal Memory (GM) In this theory, the role of the place code is thus to determine the location of the animal, given the (possibly) conflicting internal and external cues.

Reference-contexts: Reviewed Result EX.34 Hippocampal lesions combined with caudate lesions produced a drastic increase in locomotor behavior, while hippocampal lesions combined with accumbens lesions produce a drastic decrease in locomotor behavior (Whishaw and Mittleman, 1991). A number of early experiments <ref> (see Isaacson, 1974) </ref> found that hippocampal lesions produced hyperactivity in open arenas. Whishaw and Mittleman tested hippocampal lesions with 6-OHDA-induced damage to the dopaminergic inputs to the caudate or nucleus accumbens. <p> The limbic system is popularly known as the "reptilian" brain, and was believed to control the emotions and feelings that we can not control consciously. This theory traces its roots to Freud (1923) and the concept of the triune brain <ref> (see Isaacson, 1974) </ref>. It comes mostly from early inabilities to separate structures that control emotion (such as amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex) from nearby structures (such as hippocampus and posterior cingulate). Most of the data used to inform this theory comes from early lesion data.

The data from Gothard et al. (1996a) that the population of place fields always represents a coherent location when the length of a track was shortened disproved this hypothesis.

Environmental manipulations. <p> An important point to make is that all of these experiments show that when the animal is returned to an environment, the place fields return to the representation encoding that environment. In other words, place fields are often stable from session to session <ref> (Muller et al., 1987) </ref>, particularly for normal animals that are very familiar with the environment. For example, Thompson and Best (1990) report recording a stable place field for months. However, older animals show unstable representations of the environment (Barnes et al., 1997, EX.83). <p> They term this extension of the cognitive graph the multi-chart model of hippocampus and each map a chart. I have already reviewed the relationship between the multi-chart theory and the other multi-map hypotheses (multiple maps in the hippocampus (O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978), active subsets <ref> (Muller and Kubie, 1987) </ref>, and reference frames (Wan et al., 1994c; Wan et al., 1994b; Touretzky and Redish, 1996; Redish and Touretzky, 1997a)). <p> Sharp, 1996b, EX.79). * Place cells are directional when an animal takes limited paths, but non-directional when wandering randomly on open fields.

Substituting a transparent barrier didn't affect the results. <p> When the cue card was removed from the cylindrical environment shown in Figure 2.14, the place fields sometimes rotated around the center of the arena, but they did not change shape <ref> (Muller and Kubie, 1987) </ref>, suggesting that the cue card serves mainly as an orienting stimulus. O'Keefe and Speakman (1987) trained rats on a plus maze and then removed the landmarks. <p> An important point to make is that all of these experiments show that when the animal is returned to an environment, the place fields return to the representation encoding that environment. In other words, place fields are stable from session to session <ref> (Muller et al., 1987) </ref>. Thompson and Best (1990) report recording a stable place field for months. Reviewed Result EX.80 Changing the cue card from white to black eventually produces change in place field topology (Bostock et al., 1991). <p> The fact that that only barriers that intersected a cell's place field changed the field <ref> (Muller and Kubie, 1987) </ref> also supports the hypothesis that the detection range of surface orientation might be local. Compass points If a landmark is very distant to the environment, the egocentric bearing to it won't change much as the animal moves around an arena. <p> However, this cannot be the whole story because of other properties of place cells (see below). Some place cells show crescent-shaped fields along the wall of circular arenas <ref> (Muller et al., 1987, EX.65) </ref>. There are three possible explanations for this result: 1. <p> In contrast, because the animal has only one path integrator and one head direction code, it should only be able to represent a single reference frame. 3.3.2 Non-spatial aspects of place cells The multi-map hypothesis (multiple maps in the hippocampus (O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978), active subsets <ref> (Muller and Kubie, 1987) </ref>, reference frames (Wan et al., 1994b; Wan et al., 1994c; Touretzky and Redish, 1996; Redish and Touretzky, 1997a), charts (McNaughton et al., 1996; Samsonovich and McNaughton, 1997; Samsonovich, 1997)) can explain most of the non-spatial aspects seen in place cell recordings. Environmental manipulations. <p> An important point to make is that all of these experiments show that when the animal is returned to an environment, the place fields return to the representation encoding that environment. In other words, place fields are often stable from session to session <ref> (Muller et al., 1987) </ref>, particularly for normal animals that are very familiar with the environment. For example, Thompson and Best (1990) report recording a stable place field for months. However, older animals show unstable representations of the environment (Barnes et al., 1997, EX.83). <p> They term this extension of the cognitive graph the multi-chart model of hippocampus and each map a chart. I have already reviewed the relationship between the multi-chart theory and the other multi-map hypotheses (multiple maps in the hippocampus (O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978), active subsets <ref> (Muller and Kubie, 1987) </ref>, and reference frames (Wan et al., 1994c; Wan et al., 1994b; Touretzky and Redish, 1996; Redish and Touretzky, 1997a)). <p> Sharp, 1996b, EX.79). * Place cells are directional when an animal takes limited paths, but non-directional when wandering randomly on open fields. (McNaughton et al., 1983a; Markus et al., 1994; Muller et al., 1994; Gothard et al., 1996a, EX.64). * Not all place fields are convex, some fields are crescent-shaped <ref> (Muller et al., 1987) </ref>; they hug the arena walls (see Figure 2.20, EX.65). * Not all place fields are compact. <p> Samsonovich and McNaughton, 1997) be made to track actual trajectories of real animals? How accurate can it be? What is required to make it accurate? By simulating 3 In Section 3.3, I discussed the relation between the multi-map concepts (multiple maps in the hippocam-pus (O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978), active subsets <ref> (Muller and Kubie, 1987) </ref>, reference frames (Wan et al., 1994b; Wan et al., 1994c; Touretzky and Redish, 1996; Redish and Touretzky, 1997a), charts (McNaughton et al., 1996; Samsonovich and McNaughton, 1997; Samsonovich, 1997)) CHAPTER 15. <p> In this thesis, I have assumed that head direction reset occurs by distal cues only, including assuming that the cue card is a distal cue. Evidence that changing the width of the cue card does not change place fields <ref> (Muller and Kubie, 1987) </ref>, that removing the cue card only changes the orientation of the place field relative to the center of the environment (Muller and Kubie, 1987; Muller et al., 1991a; Quirk et al., 1992), and that the head direction system can be reset by a cue card even after

(1987) lesioned the fimbria, fornix, and corpus callosum and then grafted fetal septal tissue into the third ventricle near the dorsal hippocampus. <p> This is a particularly interesting view when held in comparison to the evidence that caudate is involved in taxon and praxic navigation strategies (Section 3.1, above). Animals with fimbria-fornix lesions and septal grafts can still learn the hidden platform water maze <ref> (Nilsson et al., 1987, EX.26) </ref>.

As discussed in Section 3.2.5, there is evidence that the nucleus accumbens is a key component of the goal memory (as first hypothesized by Mogenson, 1984), however, animals with fimbria-fornix lesions and septal grafts can still learn navigation tasks such as the water maze <ref> (Nilsson et al., 1987, EX.26) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In the delayed working memory version of this task, the animal is allowed to enter three of the arms, then a delay was imposed, after which the rats could enter any arm. In the reference memory version, some of the arms are never baited <ref> (Olton et al., 1979) </ref>. This forces the animals to remember those arms across all trials. Reviewed Result EX.42 Rats choose an average of more than seven different arms in their first eight choices (Olton and Samuelson, 1976). This suggests that the animals are able to recognize the different arms. <p> Rats could also be trained to use a cued version of the task in which the arms had distinctive floor textures and the arms were rotated after each choice <ref> (Olton et al., 1979) </ref>. Unfortunately, this task includes a strong delay component after each choice as the arms are rotated, and there is no way to remove that delay component from the cued version of the task.

Reference-contexts: Typical cylinder diameters are 50-100 cm. Reviewed Result EX.33 In a odor-match-to-place task, lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) lesions produce odor discrimination errors, but LEC + medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) lesions produce spatial errors as well <ref> (Otto et al., 1996) </ref>. Otto et al. (1996) examined a task which paired an odor with a location (given a specific odor, go to a specific location), LEC lesions produced occasional odor discrimination errors (animal went to the location indicated by the wrong odor). <p> It seems to be more strongly represented in the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) than the medial (MEC). In an odor-to-place matching task, LEC lesions produce incorrect odor-to-place matches, but when the LEC lesions encroached on MEC, the rats also made spatial errors <ref> (Otto et al., 1996, EX.33) </ref>. An interesting possibility is that while the location information may enter the system through MEC, the reference frame selection information (such as object identity, olfactory information, etc.) may enter via LEC.

Reviewed Result EX.51 Post-training entorhinal lesions produce both working memory and reference memory errors in spatial but not cued tasks <ref> (Rasmussen et al., 1989) </ref>. Rasmussen et al. (1989) examined rats on a collection of tasks on the radial maze that purport to examine working memory and reference memory across the cue-spatial axis. Non-spatial reference memory: one floor-textured-cued arm was baited. Spatial reference memory: one externally-cued arm was baited.

Reference-contexts: An interesting question becomes what exactly produces a context-switch. As pointed out by Rawlins, delay learning in normals is facilitated by removal from the environment during the delay, but it is also facilitated by a salient event occurring soon before the choice <ref> (Rawlins, 1985) </ref>. <p> It suggests that what matters is not the absolute time but whether a context-switch is involved or not <ref> (in contrast to Rawlins, 1985) </ref>, and it suggests that intra-maze context shifts will be hippocampally dependent (in contrast to Hirsh, 1974, and Nadel, 1994; 1995).

Furthermore, the amount of lead in ATN will depend on the angular velocity of the rotation (Redish et al., 1996). A prediction of this model, originally pointed out in Redish et al.

Place fields could be small, compact (Gaussian-shaped) fields, but they could drift in orientation (due to drift in the head direction system) (B. McNaughton, personal communication). 3. Place cells could be sensitive to the surface orientation of the wall <ref> (Touretzky and Redish, 1996) </ref>. The first mechanism is unlikely to be correct because it cannot generate place fields with concave sides | only convex, and the interior edges of these cells are concave (see e.g. <p> Since the simulations were done before Blair et al.'s experimental work, I will first present the simulations and the conclusions 1 This work was done in collaboration with Adam Elga and David S.

CHAPTER 5. <p> We have suggested that one possible explanation for this is that animals are making an association between local view and path integrator representations in the place code <ref> (Touretzky and Redish, 1996) </ref>. If the path integrator drifts as an animal explores the environment then the wrong association will be made. <p> Then let us imagine the animal is disoriented and placed into the environment. During early trials, it may self-localize to the wrong orientation (off by 180 ffi ). 1 This work was done with D. S. Touretzky <ref> (see Touretzky and Redish, 1996) </ref> and follows similar work done with D. S. Touretzky and H. S.

Reference-contexts: This representation is one possible extension of the head direction representation shown in Chapter 5. It is also an extension of a represention found in primary motor cortex and first described by Georgopoulos et al. (1983).

Wittmann and Schwegler (1995) showed how this encoding could be used to model path integration in ants, however, no such cells have yet been found in the rodent. 6.1.2-C Two-dimensional attractor networks.

Reference-contexts: Although this explanation works for specific cases (a-f, Figure 2.22), it cannot explain the interaction effect seen in cases g and h (SE entry point; two cue cards rotated by 30 ffi ; place field rotates by 180 ffi 30 ffi ). Redish and Touretzky <ref> (1996b, see also Touretzky and Redish, 1996) </ref> presented simulations of this experiment. We suggested that the results could be a consequence of a complex re-entry process dependent on intial hypotheses for head direction and path integrator representations, as well as local views to the wall and cue cards.

Reference-contexts: The second key claim in Chapter 3 is that locale navigation can be understood as an interaction between five subsystems: local view, head direction, path integration, place code, 1 and goal memory <ref> (Redish and Touretzky, 1997a) </ref>. Following explications of each of these sections, detailing computational, anatomical, and representational issues, I discuss two additional navigational issues that arise from the subsystem discussions: reference frames and route navigation. <p> I will argue in this overview that a rodent's ability to perform locale navigation tasks such as the hidden platform water maze depends on an interaction between five different spatial representations <ref> (see also Redish and Touretzky, 1997a) </ref>: * a representation of the animal's relationship to landmarks in its environment called the local view, * a metric representation of position that accommodates vector arithmetic (the path integrator), * a representation of orientation in space (head direction), CHAPTER 3. <p> Finally, the question of path integration with hippocampal lesions has just recently been tested (Alyan et al., 1997). As reviewed in the Experimental Review (EX.59), Alyan et al. confirmed the prediction that animals should be able to show path integrative abilities even with ibotenic lesions of the hippocampus <ref> (originally made in Redish and Touretzky, 1997a) </ref>. <p> The parasubiculum receives input from the postsubiculum (van Groen and Wyss, 1990), which represents the head direction of the animal (see Chapter 5). 4 This work was done with D. S. Touretzky and has been published in abstract (Redish and Touretzky, 1996a) and journal <ref> (Redish and Touretzky, 1997a) </ref> form. CHAPTER 6. PATH INTEGRATION 176 3. The parasubiculum is interconnected with parietal and cingulate cortex (Wyss and van Groen, 1992), which includes directional and behavioral representations (Chen et al., 1994a). 4. <p> We call this process path integrator reset (Wan et al., 1994a; Touretzky and Redish, 1996; Redish and Touretzky, 1997b) or self-localization <ref> (Redish and Touretzky, 1997a) </ref>. Many place cell models have included the idea that the local view influences the place code (see review, previous chapter, Section 7.2.1), but most of those models include the local view as the sole input. As reviewed previously, this must be incomplete. <p> Given the two hypotheses that (1) different directions along a linear track are represented by different maps (Wan et al., 1994c; McNaughton et al., 1996; Touretzky and Redish, 1996; Redish and Touretzky, 1997a; Samsonovich and McNaughton, 1997; Samsonovich, 1997, see EX.64 and Section 3.2.4), (2) self-localization occurs during map transitions <ref> (Redish and Touretzky, 1997a, see also Section 3.3) </ref>, then one would expect self-localization at the ends of the arms of a linear track.

As described in Section 3.3, there are two possible mechanisms for separating reference frames between two similar environments: (1) CA3 could be pre-wired into a number of charts <ref> (Samsonovich and McNaughton, 1997) </ref> or (2) the dentate gyrus could orthogonalize the input (McNaughton and Morris, 1987, see also Marr, 1969; McNaughton, 1989; Rolls, 1989; O'Reilly and McClelland, 1994; Rolls, 1996 and Chapter 10). These two theories are not incompatible, and both may be correct.

Reference-contexts: of these theories work on a variant of the following: weights are updated by a product of three terms: activity (firing rate) of the presynaptic neuron, activity (firing rate) of the postsynaptic neuron, and an error signal, indicating whether the system should encourage or discourage the pair to fire simultaneously <ref> (Schultz et al., 1995) </ref>. For this to work, the signals have to all meet together, i.e. dopaminergic synapses and glutamatergic synapses have to meet in a three-way pair with dendritic spines.

Reference-contexts: Because REM sleep is so distinctive it is easy to wake a subject up whenever it goes into REM sleep. There is a window of a few hours during which animals must be able to get REM sleep in order to learn a task such as the water maze <ref> (Smith, 1995) </ref>. During sleep, rats first enter slow-wave sleep. LIA occurs throughout the hippocampus, and irregular slow activity occurs throughout the cortex. With the onset of REM sleep, all of the animal's muscles go limp and theta appears in hippocampus, while low voltage fast activity (LVFA) occurs in the cortex.

However, the anatomical connections of the ventral presubiculum are slightly different from that of the postsubiculum (van Groen and Wyss, 1990) suggesting that the two structures may really play different roles.

Place fields could be small, compact (Gaussian-shaped) fields, but they could drift in orientation (due to drift in the head direction system) (B. McNaughton, personal communication). 3. Place cells could be sensitive to the surface orientation of the wall <ref> (Touretzky and Redish, 1996) </ref>. The first mechanism is unlikely to be correct because it cannot generate place fields with concave sides | only convex, and the interior edges of these cells are concave (see e.g. <p> We have suggested that one possible explanation for this is that animals are making an association between local view and path integrator representations in the place code <ref> (Touretzky and Redish, 1996) </ref>.

It is also an extension of a represention found in primary motor cortex and first described by Georgopoulos et al. (1983). We have shown that some motor control results can be explained by it <ref> (Redish and Touretzky, 1994) </ref>.

A number of other local view models did examine the effects of learning rules, including competitive learning (Sharp, 1991; Fuhs et al., 1997), and genetic algorithms <ref> (Treves et al., 1992) </ref>. The learning mechanisms have minor effects on the place fields. For example, Sharp (1991) used a limited field of 300 ffi in her local view input. Combined with competitive learning, this makes place cells along repeated paths directional.

Reference-contexts: The actual timing of spikes fired by hippocampal place cells precesses along the theta cycle (O'Keefe and Recce, 1993; Skaggs et al., 1996, EX.74). Effectively, the position represented in the place code sweeps across the actual position from back to front with each theta cycle <ref> (Tsodyks et al., 1996) </ref>. 3. LTP is correlational (see McNaughton and Morris, 1987; Bliss and Lynch, 1988; Brown et al., 1991; McNaughton, 1993; Malenka, 1995 for reviews). The connection between two neurons is potentiated only when spikes in the presynaptic neuron are combined with a depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron. <p> of proposals have been put forward to explain the phase precession effect, including that it is an intrinsic process formed by an interaction of two rhythms with similar frequencies that are just different enough to produce beats (O'Keefe and Recce, 1993) and that it can be generated by asymmetric connections <ref> (Tsodyks et al., 1996) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The amygdala and hypothalamus have been implicated in emotion and goal information by a number of studies (see Aggleton, 1993, and Davis et al., 1994, for reviews), and NAcb receives afferent fibers from amygdala (Aggleton, 1993; Davis et al., 1994; Finch, 1996), the ventral tegmental area <ref> (Wolske et al., 1993) </ref>, and the hypothalamus (Domesick, 1981). NAcb also receives afferents from the medial prefrontal cortex (Sesack et al., 1989; Finch, 1996), which may supply contextual information (Kolb, 1990b).

Reference-contexts: PaS receives input from the postsubiculum (van Groen and Wyss, 1990) which is a key component of the head direction system (see Chapter 5). And PaS is interconnected with posterior cingulate cortex <ref> (Wyss and van Groen, 1992) </ref>, which includes directional and behavioral representations (Chen et al., 1994a) that could supply self-motion information. The proposed loop of Sub, PaS, and ECs meet the five criteria listed above: 1. <p> S.

There is no data showing that the update mechanism described in Section 6.1.2-C occurs in the Sub-PaS-ECs loop, but it is plausible because only one complex connection structure would have to be learned.

The firing rates of hippocampal pyramidal ("place") cells are also correlated with information other than location of the animal: speed, direction, and turning angle (McNaughton et al., 1983a; Wiener et al., 1989; Markus et al., 1994), texture underfoot <ref> (Young et al., 1994) </ref>, odor (Eichenbaum et al., 1987; Eichenbaum and Cohen, 1988; Otto and Eichenbaum, 1992; Cohen and Eichenbaum, 1993), task (Markus et al., 1995), and stage of task (Eichenbaum et al., 1987; Otto and Eichenbaum, 1992; Hampson et al., 1993). <p> As discussed in the Experimental Review, place cells in a number of tasks have been found to be correlated with nonspatial aspects including speed, direction, and turning angle (McNaughton et al., 1983a; Wiener et al., 1989; Markus et al., 1994), texture underfoot <ref> (Young et al., 1994) </ref>, odor (Eichenbaum et al., 1987; Eichenbaum and Cohen, 1988; Otto and Eichenbaum, 1992; Cohen and Eichenbaum, 1993), task (Markus et al., 1995), and stage of task (Eichenbaum et al., 1987; Otto and Eichenbaum, 1992; Hampson et al., 1993). <p> pyramidal cells are sometimes correlated to other aspects of the environment beyond the location of the animal, including local view (Muller et al., 1987; Muller and Kubie, 1987; Bostock et al., 1991), speed, direction, turning angle (McNaughton et al., 1983a; Markus et al., 1994; Wiener et al., 1989), texture underfoot <ref> (Young et al., 1994) </ref>, odor (Eichenbaum et al., 1987), task (Markus et al., 1995), and stage of task (Eichenbaum et al., 1987), as well as recent environmental effects such as a wall being lifted (Wilson and McNaughton, 1993), the lights turning on or off (Quirk et al., 1990), or the environment
