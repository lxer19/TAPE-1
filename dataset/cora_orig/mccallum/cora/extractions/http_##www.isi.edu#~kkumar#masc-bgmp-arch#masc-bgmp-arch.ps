Title: The MASC/BGMP Architecture for Inter-domain Multicast Routing architecture, together with existing protocols operating within each
Author: Satish Kumar Pavlin Radoslavov Dave Thaler Cengiz Alaettinoglu Deborah Estrin Mark Handley 
Note: This  
Abstract: Multicast routing enables efficient data distribution to multiple recipients. However, existing work has concentrated on extending single-domain techniques to wide-area networks, rather than providing mechanisms to realize inter-domain multicast on a global scale in the Internet. We describe an architecture for inter-domain multicast routing that consists of two complementary protocols. The Multicast Address-Set Claim (MASC) protocol forms the basis for a hierarchical address allocation architecture. It dynamically allocates to domains multicast address ranges from which groups initiated in the domain get their multicast addresses. The Border-Gateway Multicast Protocol (BGMP), run by the border routers of a domain, constructs inter-domain bidirectional shared trees, while allowing any existing multicast routing protocol to be used within individual domains. The resulting shared tree for a group is rooted at the domain whose address range covers the group's address; this domain is typically the group initiator's domain. We demonstrate the feasibility and performance of these complementary protocols through simulation.

MOSPF [5] floods group membership information to all the routers so that they can build multicast distribution trees.

Reference-contexts: Senders to the group use this address as the destination of packets to reach all the members of the group. The multicast addresses do not have any structure to them. A multicast group initiator typically contacts an address allocation application (e.g., the session directory tool, sdr <ref> [10] </ref>) and an address is randomly assigned from those not known to be in use. <p> Hence, a need has been recognized for a hierarchical multicast address allocation scheme <ref> [10] </ref> for the Internet. The Internet today is an interconnection of networks administered by different organizations. The set of networks under administrative control of a single organization is referred to as an Autonomous System or domain.

Reference-contexts: These servers coordinate with each other using intra-domain mechanisms <ref> [13] </ref> to assign unique multicast addresses to clients in their domain from address ranges provided, and to monitor the domain's address space utilization. When necessary, they communicate to the MASC nodes the need for more address space or to relinquish some of the acquired space.

Reference-contexts: The claimers wait for a suitably long period to detect any collision, before communicating the acquired range to the domain's Multicast Address Allocation Servers (MAAS's)[13] and to other domains through the inter-domain routing protocol, BGP <ref> [14, 15] </ref> as group routes. MAAS's can then allocate individual multicast addresses to groups initiated in their domain. BGMP (run by the border routers of a domain) uses the BGP group routes to construct multicast distribution trees for active multicast groups.

Reference-contexts: They then locally select the same best route (using the same preference function) to each destination. The chosen route is then advertised by the border routers to the external peers. BGP is currently being extended <ref> [16] </ref> to carry multiple types of routes for destinations and consequently allow multiple logical views of the routing table corresponding to each route type. This helps in supporting other network layer protocols like QoS routing and multicast routing protocols.

Reference-contexts: This cannot be addressed by caching the information obtained from a remote lookup since data packets can be lost deterministically if the packet inter-arrival time is greater than the router state time-out period <ref> [20] </ref>. Intra-domain multicast routing protocol independence: Intra-domain multicast routing protocol independence allows each domain the choice of which multicast routing protocol to run inside the domain. This allows each domain the autonomy to run a protocol that is best suited for its needs.

Reference-contexts: This helps us adapt continually to usage patterns so that better aggregation can be achieved. The results below are with the use of contiguous masks for address prefixes. We are also investigating the use of non-contiguous masks as in Francis' Kampai <ref> [21] </ref> scheme. The use of non-contiguous masks in the Internet may face operational resistance (due to difficulty in understanding the scheme) but would provide even better address space utilization. <p> MASC claim algorithm: The algorithm that domains use to claim address ranges, while achieving good address space utilization and aggregation of group routes, needs to be studied more. The performance of the algorithm could be improved by the use of non-contiguous masks as in Tsuchiya's Kampai <ref> [21] </ref> scheme. Address allocation interface: It may be desirable to allow a group initiator to pick a group address such that the resulting tree is rooted in another domain.

Reference-contexts: When a host in the domain joins a new group whose root domain is elsewhere in the Internet, the BGMP component of the best exit router is informed by the domain's MIGP. The rules to achieve this are MIGP-specific. For example, in DVMRP, a Domain Wide Report <ref> [22] </ref> is sent to the MIGP components of the domain's border routers, including the exit border router, when a host joins a new group.

Reference-contexts: The unidirectional trees performed much worse compared to the bidirectional trees, with their average path lengths being about twice that of the shortest-path trees (maximum worst case path lengths up to 6 times that of the shortest-path trees). 6 Related work HPIM <ref> [23] </ref> builds on PIM-SM by using a hierarchy of RPs for a group. A receiver would send joins to the lowest level RP, which in turn would join a RP at the next level, and so on.

Reference-contexts: Data from senders flows along the branches of this tree in a bidirectional manner to reach receivers. However, as HPIM uses hash functions to choose the next RP at each level, the trees can be very bad in the worst case, especially for global groups. OCBT <ref> [24] </ref> is a proposed extension to CBT where a hierarchy of cores is used for a group on the lines of HPIM.

Reference-contexts: Both HPIM and OCBT do not allow MIGP independence; i.e., it is not possible to run an arbitrary MIGP inside the domain, and run HPIM or OCBT only for inter-domain multicast. HPIM and OCBT also do not explicitly address policy constraints of domains. HDVMRP <ref> [25] </ref> has been proposed as an inter-region (or domain) routing protocol that interconnects regions running any of the existing multicast protocols.
