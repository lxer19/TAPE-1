Title: Towards Goal-Directed Diagnosis (Preliminary Report)

Abstract: Recent research has abstracted diagnosis away from the activity needed to acquire information and to act on diagnosed disorders. In some problem domains, however, such abstraction is counter-productive and does not reflect real-life practice, which integrates diagnostic and therapeutic activity. Trauma management is a case in point. Here, we discuss a formalization of the integrated approach taken in TraumAID, a system we have developed to serve as an artificial aide to residents and physicians dealing with multiple trauma. Among other things, the active pursuit of information raises the question of what is and what is not worth pursuing. In TraumAID 2.0, we take the view that the process of diagnosis should continue only as long as it is likely to make a difference to future actions. That view is formalized in the goal-directed diagnostic paradigm (GDD). Unlike other diagnostic paradigms, goal-directed diagnosis is first and foremost concerned with setting goals based on its conclusions. It regards the traditional construction of an explanation for the faulty behavior as secondary. In order to explicitly represent goal-directedness, the diagnostic process is viewed as search in a space of attitude-beliefs. From this, we derive a high-level algorithm that produces appropriate requests for action while searching for an explanation. A complete explanation, however, is not the criterion for terminating action. Such a criterion, we argue, is better treated in terms of goal-means tradeoffs. TraumAID's architecture, in so far as it embodies this goal-directed approach, assigns to a complementary planner the resolution of such tradeoffs.

Reference-contexts: The obvious problem with this solution is that rules become complex and hard to maintain, while also losing the separate function that these particular antecedent clauses are meant to serve (cf. <ref> [Clancey 83] </ref>.) Our alternative solution to goal inhibition is a general framework for specifying relationships among goals and between goals and conclusions. It is in the form of two hierarchies that can be expanded over a set of GDD rules before they are run, thereby adding relevant inhibition clauses automatically.

Reference-contexts: In addition to that research, within the GDD paradigm, it appears worthwhile to add a time component to beliefs, augmenting the inference rules appropriately with mappings from the times in which the antecedents hold to the times in which the consequent holds. A mechanism of the type suggested by <ref> [Console and Torasso 90] </ref> seems a natural start point for that process.

Reference-contexts: Within that approach the user can define an acceptable mode of operation, and the theory provides for which forms of repair may entail a situation that is compatible with such a requirement. <ref> [Friedrich et al 91] </ref> presents a general theory for diagnosis and repair. Within that theory, the user may again define acceptable working conditions for the ailing system. A possible-worlds approach is then taken to formally define those steps that can bring the faulty system to such a condition.

Reference-contexts: TraumAID's planner is described in more detail in [Rymon 91a, Webber et al 91, Rymon 90]. An important issue in dynamic diagnostic systems is the timely and orderly acquisition of necessary information. The problem of efficiently acquiring new information along the diagnosis process has been addressed in medical systems <ref> [Horvitz et al 84, Shwe et al 89] </ref>, as well as in domain-independent paradigms [de Kleer and Williams 87, Reggia et al 85b]. Most have taken a probabilistic approach that maximizes the utility associated with the next piece of information.

Reference-contexts: One of the problems with general theories of diagnosis has been that every too often, an exponential number of hypothetical failures (diagnoses) can "explain" the faulty behavior [Rymon 91]. Thus one faces the problem of which possibility to attend to first. <ref> [Poole and Provan 90] </ref> were the first to note that the optimality of a diagnosis must depend on post-diagnosis goals. To that end, [Provan and Poole 91] advocates the use of utilities in order to choose among different potential diagnoses.

Reference-contexts: Such activity is often costly and may present direct risk to the patient. Goal-Directed diagnosis begins from the point of view that diagnosis is only worthwhile only to the extent that it can affect decisions concerning actions. As such it differs from other characterizations of diagnosis (e.g. <ref> [Reggia et al 85a, Reiter 87] </ref>), that seek complete explanations for observed faulty behavior. This view is embodied in TraumAID 2.0 | a system designed to serve as an artificial aide to residents and physicians dealing with multiple penetrating injuries in a trauma domain [Webber et al 91].

An important issue in dynamic diagnostic systems is the timely and orderly acquisition of necessary information. <p> Finally, there is the time taken for planning. As we all know, planning is computa-tionally costly. Even very costly. However, that cost is inescapable since TraumAID must anyhow plan for therapeutic reasons. <ref> [Rymon 90] </ref> describes a greedy planning paradigm used by TraumAID's planner. 5 Example This example is meant to illustrate the diagnostic reasoning process just described and the way it complements the activities recommended by a planner such as TraumAID's.

Reference-contexts: This view is embodied in TraumAID 2.0 | a system designed to serve as an artificial aide to residents and physicians dealing with multiple penetrating injuries in a trauma domain <ref> [Webber et al 91] </ref>. TraumAID 2.0 integrates diagnostic reasoning with planning and action.

Work in progress: 1. Implementation within the TraumAID project, we have completed a revision of our existing system <ref> [Webber et al 91] </ref>. The new system's architecture is identical to the one just described. Its diagnostic component is similar, although not identical, to the one described. In the last step of the revision process, funded by AHCPR, we have just finished validating the system against 234 theoretical cases.
