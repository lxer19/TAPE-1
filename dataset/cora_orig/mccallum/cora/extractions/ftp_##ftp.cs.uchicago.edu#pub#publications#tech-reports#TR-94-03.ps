Abstract: We present here a proof of H-astad's switching lemma. The switching lemma has important applications in the proof of lower bounds in circuit complexity as well as other areas of complexity theory. The proof presented here is based on the one presented in [5], expressed in terms of Kolmogorov complexity by Lance Fortnow. H-astad's switching lemma [3] is a prime example of the so-called "restriction" or "bottom-up" method used to find lower bounds in circuit complexity. This approach consists of considering circuits from the bottom level (inputs), and showing that restricting the function by fixing some of the inputs does not always force the function to zero or one. Applications of H-asta's lemma include lower bounds on the size of constant-depth, unbounded fan-in circuits for parity ([3]), and the construction of oracles for which the polynomial-time hierarchy is infinite ([2, 6]).

Reference-contexts: Let R l be the set of restrictions that leave l variables free. In the course of the proof, we will use the fact that the cardinality of R l is jR l j = n ! H-astad's lemma <ref> [3] </ref> is stated below. 2 Lemma 1.1 (H-astad) If f is t-closed on n variables then there is a restric- tion 2 R l such that f j is s-open if fltl n &lt; 1 for a fixed constant fl &lt; 5.
