Abstract: OO7 has been widely used by developers to benchmark commercial Object Oriented Data Bases (OODB) and by researchers as a realistic workload for experimenting with persistent object systems (POS). These uses of OO7 levy very different requirements; the former needs an application benchmark while the latter needs a system benchmark. This paper describes our experiences with using OO7 both as an application benchmark and a system benchmark. Based on this experience, we outline a framework of the features needed for both kinds of benchmarks. We evaluated OO7 using this framework and found it unsuitable for these tasks.

Reference-contexts: In the absence of real application workloads, a synthetic OODB benchmark is a reasonable option. OO1 [2] was the first OODB benchmark, followed by the HyperModel benchmark <ref> [1] </ref> and OO7 [3] benchmarks. Since these benchmarks have incrementally built upon earlier efforts, we will focus on OO7, the latest in the series. The rest of this paper is based on our experience with OO7 as both a systems and an application benchmark.

Reference-contexts: The lack of a foundation based on analysis and measurement of real applications in synthetic workloads makes it difficult to correlate them with real applications. In the absence of real application workloads, a synthetic OODB benchmark is a reasonable option.

Reference-contexts: surrogate workload by mapping the application data structures and workloads to OO7 which we could port and run on commercial OODBs.We also used OO7 as a systems benchmark to measure the cost of swizzling in the Texas POS [5] and compare its performance to a single address space system, Opal <ref> [4] </ref>.
