Abstract: The University of Michigan Digital Library is a large-scale confederation of software agents, providing library content and services to users and each other within a distributed network environment. Allocation of resources and activities to the various agents is determined through a market-based negotiation process, where agents tender offers to buy or sell services, basic resources, and other information goods for specified prices. Generalized auction modules resolve these offers into deals among agents. Viewing each agent as an information consumer or entrepreneur, the digital library as a whole constitutes a virtual economy of information goods and services.

The SIGMA information retrieval system (Karakoulas & Ferguson 1995) is expressly conceived as a computational market, and we expect that the particular SIGMA information agents would be relatively at home in UMDL.

Reference-contexts: Section presents a very simple, but representative, scenario|implemented in UMDL|where typical digital library goods and services are exchanged using one particular class of market mechanisms. Market Facilitators Within a multiagent environment, system agents specializing in brokering connections among other agents are often called facilitators <ref> (Genesereth & Ketchpel 1994) </ref>. In the UMDL, market facilitators, or auctions, serve to determine which agents provide services to which others, under what terms. UMDL auctions operate by collecting offers and determining agreements consistent with those offers.

Reference-contexts: As with negotiation mechanisms, the ideal payment mechanism may depend on many context-specific factors (MacKie-Mason & White 1996), and so it may be advantageous to support a generic payment interface <ref> (Ketchpel et al. 1996) </ref>. Specifying Auctions We define auctions in UMDL via a straightforward auction specification language. This language serves two purposes. One is to organize the software implementation, so that components realizing particular auction features can be combined and reused.

Our own prior work studied a computational market model of network information services <ref> (Mullen & Wellman 1995) </ref>, and served as a prototype for the UMDL information service economy discussed in this paper. Several of the emerging large-scale digital library systems are incorporating payment mechanisms, primarily to support compensation for intellectual property usage.

Reference-contexts: After a market clears, the auction may invoke some transaction execution services, depending on the nature of the exchange being mediated. For instance, we are currently planning to integrate UMDL with the NetBill payment mechanism <ref> (Sirbu & Tygar 1995) </ref> to exchange monetary fees for digital objects. As with negotiation mechanisms, the ideal payment mechanism may depend on many context-specific factors (MacKie-Mason & White 1996), and so it may be advantageous to support a generic payment interface (Ketchpel et al. 1996).

Reference-contexts: If there are multiple units and price discrimination (i.e., charging different buyers different prices) is acceptable, then the generalized Vickrey procedure described by Varian <ref> (Varian 1995) </ref> might be a good choice. Under alternate circumstances, yet other rules would yield the best balance of desiderata. For example, some key criteria for choosing auction types within UMDL are fostering market configurations that are incentive compatible and individually rational.
