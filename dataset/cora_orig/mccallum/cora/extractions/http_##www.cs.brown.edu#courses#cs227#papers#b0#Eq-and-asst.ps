Reference-contexts: Eiffel also provides a recursive equality test called deep equal , which is carefully defined ([4, page 306]) to provide correct results for cyclic structures. Smalltalk-80 provides several primitives from which programmers can construct appropriate equality predicates <ref> [1] </ref>. Value comparison is built-in: x = y is true if x and y have the same representation. Reference comparison is also built-in: x == y is true if x and y denote the same object.

Reference-contexts: Acknowledgements This paper was motivated partly by a discussion in the internet newsgroup comp.object. Some of the ideas presented here were drawn from an earlier paper <ref> [2] </ref>. Discussions with Richard Fateman, Michael Monagan, and Adam Steele were very helpful.

Reference-contexts: Although CLU is not an object oriented language, it comes close, especially with its approach to data abstraction <ref> [3] </ref>. The definition of equality for a user-defined type is the programmer's responsibility, but there are certain conventions. One of the conventions is that, if x = y, it must be impossible to distinguish between x and y.

Reference-contexts: The function similar is used to determine whether two distinct objects have similar or equal components. Eiffel provides a number of options for object comparison <ref> [4] </ref>. The predicate equal returns true if its arguments: are both void; both point to the same object; are equal values of a simple type; or are objects with identical components. The name equal is statically bound to a method: calls have the form equal (x; y).

Reference-contexts: The same operator can be overloaded in the definition of a member function, allowing users to define their own equality tests. Equality 8 CLOS, which is based on Common LISP, provides several built-in functions to test equality <ref> [5] </ref>. The expression (eq x y) is true iff x and y are the same object. However, CLOS does not guarantee that strings and numbers have unique representations. Consequently, expressions such as (eq "ho" "ho") and (let ((n 19)) (eq n n)) might be true or false.
