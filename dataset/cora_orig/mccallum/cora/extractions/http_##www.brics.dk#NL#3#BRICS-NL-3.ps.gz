Abstract: We stand now at the middle of our second year, having just completed a second successful theme in Logic in Semantics. To date we have 87 publications in our report series and 10 in the notes series. In addition, we have begun a Lecture Series for the propagation of high quality lecture notes on topics in the foundations of Computer Sciencewe presently have 3. These are all available electronically. All told there are many indications that BRICS is becoming widely regarded as a significant site for theoretical Computer Science. A part of our contribution is through hosting and chairing conferences (we have recently held TAPSOFT, shall host CSL '97 and Glynn Winskel is to be program chair for LICS '97). But, ultimately a more important contribution is the active participation of BRICS researchers on the international research scene. We are pleased by the level of activity of BRICS researchers and their visibility through presentations at prestigious conferences. Our visibility has led to a satisfyingly high number and broad international spread of well qualified applicants for BRICS positions. Closer to home, we have made efforts to explain the enterprises of BRICS to our younger students. In particular, a course on Pearls of theory, described in more detail below, introduces students to a range of issues, techniques and problems in theoretical Computer Science. We will continue to work towards an exciting research environment that can be felt also at the undergraduate level. It's surely not just a coincidence that we recently attracted an impressive pool of applica tions for PhD's in the areas of BRICS.

Reference-contexts: The third lecture considered simplifications resulting from considering only partially dynamic algorithms. The final lecture covered the very recent work of [4]. A draft of a forthcoming book on the subject <ref> [1] </ref> was also circulated in addition to the covered literature. For further information, see the BRICS WWW page. The course was very well attended by researchers and students from Aarhus and Odense.

Reference-contexts: Sparsification, 3. Semi-Dynamic Graph Algorithms, 4. Fully Dynamic Randomized Connectivity. The first lecture was introductory and covered the seminal work of Frederickson [3]. The second lecture introduced the simple but powerful general method to speed up dynamic graph algorithms called sparsification introduced by <ref> [2] </ref>. The third lecture considered simplifications resulting from considering only partially dynamic algorithms. The final lecture covered the very recent work of [4]. A draft of a forthcoming book on the subject [1] was also circulated in addition to the covered literature. For further information, see the BRICS WWW page.

Reference-contexts: The course was or-ganised into four lectures, each lasting approximately two hours: 1. Introduction and Basic Dynamic Graph Algorithms, 2. Sparsification, 3. Semi-Dynamic Graph Algorithms, 4. Fully Dynamic Randomized Connectivity. The first lecture was introductory and covered the seminal work of Frederickson <ref> [3] </ref>. The second lecture introduced the simple but powerful general method to speed up dynamic graph algorithms called sparsification introduced by [2]. The third lecture considered simplifications resulting from considering only partially dynamic algorithms. The final lecture covered the very recent work of [4].
