Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a known two-dimensional object in an image, or verifying that it does not appear in the image. We adopt the strategy of doing a fast scan for potential places in the image where the object could be; we call this scan pose proposal. Each pose hypothesis is a set of edges that correspond to a subset of the transformed object boundary. Our algorithm works by finding U-shaped segments of object boundaries, doing a quick match process between U-shaped segments in the image and the model, and combining the matches into overall pose hypotheses. Analysis and experiments show that the algorithm runs efficiently, and does a good job of discarding all but a few spots in the image as possible pose hypotheses.

Reference-contexts: For each pose hypothesis there is a set of image edges that are postulated to belong to the contour if so posed, and these are called the edge set selected by the pose hypothesis. proposal <ref> [8, 6, 1, 9] </ref>, it is assumed that the model is represented as a set of "features," where a feature is typically a curvature extremum of the model's boundary. <p> Pose clustering is often expensive and error-prone because each match constrains the possible poses only a little bit, so that many matches have to be accumulated before a clear cluster emerges. The reason each match means so little is that most work in the field <ref> [2, 8, 6, 1, 9] </ref>, takes features to be point-like entities, or small groups of such entities. But many features look alike; and any given feature match doesn't constrain the pose very much.

Reference-contexts: One can then locate peaks in the histogram of votes, and discard all features that do not participate in these clusters. Each cluster corresponds to a pose hypothesis.
