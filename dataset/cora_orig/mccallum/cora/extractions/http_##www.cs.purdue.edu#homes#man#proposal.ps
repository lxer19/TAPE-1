Title: Information Retrieval from a Vast Repository of Complex Data  
Abstract: NASA has terabytes of multimedia data for exploration of Space Science, Atmospheric Science, Flight Dynamics, Life Sciences, and other related fields of science. This data is available in electronic and other forms. Scientists and the general public including students should be able to use it in learning and scientific research. The task of accessing this data can be made simple by using a variety of user interfaces and the notion digital libraries. A digital library contains text, images, and sound in an integrated document repository. Digital libraries can be networked to give users (local/remote) access to a vast amount of data, information, knowledge, and vision. The concept of digital libraries can be realized by enhancing and integrating technologies in databases, communication networks, user interfaces, knowledge management, and information retrieval. A digital library containing the NASA data like satellite images, global change data, data from space shuttle or space station experiments can be built taking advantage of research advances in graphics, window-based systems, and ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) networks for high bandwidth communication. Our research will contribute in managing the NASA databases so that a variety of users can retrieve it in various degrees of detail and depth. Users should be able to locate relevant data without searching the entire information repository. Users may know approximately what data they need but might not be able to specify their needs precisely. They may not initially know exactly what data is available and needed. But if the system can interactively assist the users in getting the right data and information they will be able to increase their scientific knowledge. To help them, a retrieval based on content and imprecise queries should be supported. Existing indexing schemes are too rigid and do not support retrieval based on semantic content of information. We propose to develop techniques that will allow the user to specify a query based on her partial knowledge of the content and route her query to the appropriate information base. We propose to develop techniques for content-based retrieval of images and other multimedia data in addition to text. We will propose new algorithms and techniques in the area of digital library management and develop a prototype to demonstrate the implementation of a NASA digital library.

Reference-contexts: It is often the case with nontechnical users that the person's resources or knowledge is inadequate and hence the query specified is not specific <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 Approach We will integrate techniques used in O-RAID, (object-oriented RAID), MM-RAID (multimedia RAID), user interface systems (Suite system) and information retrieval to develop a prototype system for digital libraries for NASA data. RAID (robust adaptable distributed database system) has been developed in our laboratory. <p> In this method, texts and queries are vectors in multidimensional space, the dimensions of which are the words used to represent the texts. Queries and texts are compared by comparing the vectors using some similarity measure like cosine similarity. Probabilistic methods are based on the Probability Ranking Principle <ref> [1] </ref>. This states that the function of an information retrieval system is to rank the texts in the database in the order of the probability of relevance to the query. This principle takes into account that representation of an information need is uncertain.

Reference-contexts: The system will provide some intelligence to assist users who may not fully 2 understand the complex structure of the multimedia database. We have prototyped a graphical interface called O-UI [12] using the Suite system <ref> [2] </ref> for the O-RAID database system at Purdue University. Suite provides a dialogue manager to manage the user interface aspects of the application. The Suite dialogue manager will be used to interactively refine the user query.

Reference-contexts: The Wide Area Information Server system (WAIS), which uses the Z39.50 standard as its basis, supports traditional text search, mostly index based. A WAIS user has to scroll through a long list of servers to locate a server which contains the desired kind of information <ref> [3] </ref>. WAIS has the ability to handle non-textual data, but this capacity is currently being used to a very limited extent. For example, some images can only be retrieved by providing the name of the file in which the image is stored. World-Wide Web facilitates hypermedia access across the Internet. <p> In the following subsections we present existing retrieval schemes and study their suitability for implementation in a digital library. The schemes are presented in increasing order of complexity. Information retrieval techniques can be divided into three classes: tag-based retrieval, partial content-based retrieval and full content-based retrieval <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.1 Tag-Based Retrieval When data objects are added to the information base, a human expert has to provide a set of keywords to represent the object. The information retrieval system uses this information as an index to retrieve data. The data objects themselves are never inspected by the system. <p> There is thus a conflict between desire for thorough information retrieval and the desire for tight, efficient access structures. The limits of information retrieval are attained by full-content based methods <ref> [3] </ref>. These methods use no access structures whatsoever. The entire data object can be used for retrieval. No information is omitted from the search.

Reference-contexts: Experts, students, and others will be able to use NASA data. Our prototype system will demonstrate the principles of the implementation of a NASA digital library. 2 Background and Related Work A variety of systems have been built for networked information retrieval and discovery <ref> [4] </ref>. Archie uses the rather limited approach of text scanning or string search to find useful, publicly accessible files scattered around the Internet. Gopher is slightly better, and supports browsing through the so-called cyberspace, using menus and directory navigation.

Reference-contexts: An image query language has been specified in [14]. Another approach is to use shape similarity-based retrieval where the user specifies iconic queries (queries which include images). Polygonal approximations are used to represent actual shape boundaries <ref> [6] </ref>. The similarity of any two features is defined by the Euclidean distance between the corresponding pairs of points. An exact match is not possible because of the inherent problem of distortion 4 in images. A measure of similarity must be developed.

Reference-contexts: This intelligent interface should allow the user to interactively refine her query based on her partial knowledge. * Explore different schemes for displaying data. Presentation of data could be by text descriptions, photographs, changing images, or video <ref> [7] </ref>. Changing images must be displayed on a temporal scale. The view of the ozone hole for example, over the last century, the last ten years, or the last year, may be of interest to a user. This research will make NASA data accessible to a number of users.

Reference-contexts: The discrimination value of a term reflects the amount of difference it makes to the document similarity function if that term is removed from consideration. As discussed above, these schemes target text applications. Automatic indexing of images is a difficult problem <ref> [13] </ref>. However, given a sufficient body of domain-specific patterns and rules for image analysis, one can identify the different objects in an image. The data available at NASA for example, can be classified into domains like space data, Earth data, atmospheric data, and aircraft control data.

Reference-contexts: It will not be possible to define exact-match methods but best-match methods could be employed. The images can be subjected to a domain-specific image analysis and this information can be used by the user to perform semantic content-based retrieval. An image query language has been specified in <ref> [14] </ref>. Another approach is to use shape similarity-based retrieval where the user specifies iconic queries (queries which include images). Polygonal approximations are used to represent actual shape boundaries [6]. The similarity of any two features is defined by the Euclidean distance between the corresponding pairs of points.

Reference-contexts: To fully exploit this facility, users should be able to retrieve books using any component. Multimedia objects such as images carry an information content which enriches the textual content of documents and which could be exploited by the user and the system in query formulation <ref> [15] </ref>. Existing systems allow image information to be queried only on the basis of manually inserted textual descriptors of the image content. Digital libraries have the added functionality of being interactive. This feature can be exploited so that the user need not specify a precise query. <p> For example, an image of the earth (figure 2) can be represented using the following qualities: Color: Blue Season when the image was taken: Winter What it was meant to capture: Cloud formations A primitive class can be associated with images <ref> [15] </ref>. The paper suggests that there should be an IMAGE class, the instances of which are all the image objects stored in the information base. It will not be possible to define exact-match methods but best-match methods could be employed.

Reference-contexts: A Sparc-10 will be made available to the NASA fellow. The WANCE tool (a Wide Area Network Communication Emulation System), developed at the RAID laboratory, will be used to emulate a real distributed system consisting of geographically distributed sites <ref> [17] </ref>. Thus evaluation and testing of techniques can be conducted at the laboratory. Several tools and software kits for user interface development, communication, and multimedia research are available. The RAID laboratory is supported by AT&T and Unisys.
