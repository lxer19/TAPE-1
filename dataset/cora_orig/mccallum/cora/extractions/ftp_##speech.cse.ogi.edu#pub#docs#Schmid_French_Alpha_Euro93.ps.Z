Abstract: We describe a real-time speaker-independent French alphabet recognizer that performs with sufficient accuracy for commercial use. The system (a) digitizes a sequence of letters separated by brief pauses and computes a RASTA-PLP spectral representation, zero-crossing rate and peak-to-peak amplitudes of the waveform; (b) uses a neural network to assign 23 phonetic category labels to successive time frames; (c) performs an initial segmentation of the speech by mapping the phonetic label scores for each frame to pronunciation models for each letter using a modified Viterbi search; (d) performs a second classification of each hypothesized letter using the segment boundaries provided by the first-pass segmentation, producing a set of 26 letter scores plus a score for the category "Not-A-Letter"; and (e) uses the letter scores (plus the score for the category "Not-A-Letter") to identify the spelled word from a data base. The system has been evaluated on calls that were not used for training either network. The system achieved 84.4% first choice letter recognition accuracy on the test set. The system has also been evaluated on 84 spelled names from different callers where it achieved 92.8% correct recognition of the 84 spelled names contained in a database of 50,000 names. The final system has been optimized to run in real-time on a PC-board based on a single DSP TMS320C30. The two passes described above are performed in real-time by the DSP while the name search (up to 50,000 names) is performed (as letters are recognized) by the PC.

Reference-contexts: Because of the similarities between the alphabets, we were able to use the English alphabet recognizer to help automate the transcription of French letters. 2. SYSTEM OVERVIEW The French alphabet recognizer is modeled after an English alphabet recognizer described at Eurospeech 1991 <ref> [2] </ref>. The system accepts telephone speech and performs speaker-independent French alphabet recognition and directory name retrieval. The system modules are shown in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: Data Capture. Telephone speech is sampled at 8 kHz at 14-bit resolution using the Gradient Technology Desklab attached to a UNIX workstation. Signal Representation. Signal processing routines perform a seventh order RASTA-PLP (Perceptual Linear Predictive) analysis <ref> [3] </ref> every 6 msec using a 10 msec window. This analysis yields eight coefficients per frame. In addition the zero-crossing rate and the peak-to-peak amplitude are computed at this stage. Frame-based Phonetic Classification.

Reference-contexts: Training and Test Sets The first pass segmenter was trained on 160 phonetically labeled alphabets (the letters "A" through "Z" in correct or 2 der). The speech frames used to extract the features and train the neural network were carefully selected as suggested in <ref> [4] </ref>. A cross-validation test set was used to determine the optimal amount of training for the neural network. It was made up of the remaining 40 phonetically labeled alphabets.

Reference-contexts: In order to determine the best construction of French letter models using the English letter sound categories, we ran the English segmenter on several French alphabets, using only duration constraints to guide the Viterbi search. This process is similar to the pronunciation model generation algorithm described in <ref> [5] </ref>. Once the first 20 French alphabets were automatically segmented and hand corrected, the initial English phoneme labels were remapped to the French phonetic labels. Then an initial French segmenter was trained and used to segment the next 20 alphabets, which in turn were again hand corrected.
