Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In order to tell the story of CICS, it is simpler to begin by explaining what CICS is and thus the next few sections describe the CICS products of 1994. For more general information on IBM's transaction monitors, see [IBM4]. For more general information on CICS see <ref> [Gera93, Yela85] </ref>. CICS runs on a number of operating systems which are listed at the end of this article. In addition, there are a number of CICS-like products that have been developed independently of IBM, which are an indication of CICS's success. <p> Thanks also to all the people who have worked on CICS. 8 5.3 Dates of first releases These are the first shipment dates for some of the CICS products from IBM. The list is derived from information in <ref> [Gera93] </ref>. * CICS/OS: 1969, CICS/OS/VS: 1974, CICS/MVS: 1988, CICS/ESA: 1990. * CICS/DOS: 1971, CICS/DOS/VS: 1974, CICS/VSE: 1990. * CICS OS/2: 1989, CICS/6000: 1993, CICS/400: 1993. CICS from IBM has been available for other operating systems, e.g. VM and DPPX.

Reference-contexts: The application programmers still used 360 Assembler macros to access CICS services. 4.2 A tale of two transaction monitors Also in the 1960s, the Information Management System (IMS) transaction monitor and database manager was developed by IBM in collaboration with Rockwell <ref> [Graf83] </ref>. Rockwell was one of the contractors for the Apollo space program, and one of Rockwell's requirements was to manage the two million parts needed for a single spacecraft, which IMS helped to satisfy.

Reference-contexts: It was observed that many elements of these systems were common, and a team of six people was set up at IBM in Des Plaines (near Chicago) to develop what became CICS [IBM92]. The product was initially announced as "Public Utility Customer Information Control System" (PUCICS) in 1968 <ref> [IBM68] </ref>. It was re-announced the following year at the time of availability as CICS [IBM69] and it included the following components: Program, storage and task management; Terminal management; File, temporary storage and transient data management; Signon/Signoff; Master and supervisory terminal function; System statistics and system shutdown.

Reference: [IBM5] <author> SC33-1007 - CICS Family: </author> <title> API Structure. </title>
Reference-contexts: The CICS API is made up of about a hundred commands with hundreds of keywords and it is summarized in <ref> [IBM5] </ref>. The CICS API and the way CICS systems communicate with each other is monitored closely at Hursley by the CICS Architecture Board, to ensure compatibility when extensions are made. <p> Information can be returned in "sun-shine" to the calling program. The program Hursley can be on the same or different CICS system, e.g. the client system could be CICS OS/2 and the server system could be CICS/6000. These are the CICS API functional areas, as listed in <ref> [IBM5] </ref>: abend handling (processing abnormal terminations), APPC (Advanced Program to Program Communication), authentication, BMS (Basic Mapping Support), diagnostic services (dump and trace), environment services, exception handling, 3 file control, interval control, journal control, monitoring program control, storage control, syncpoint (commit, rollback), task control, temporary storage, terminal control and transient data.

Reference-contexts: Multiple invocations can be part of the same transaction or run in separate transactions. An interface similar to the External Call Interface has recently been announced for CICS/ESA 4.1 enabling batch MVS, TSO or IMS programs to call CICS programs. For more information on CICS OS/2, please see <ref> [Lamb92] </ref>. 4.10 CICS/6000 CICS/6000 for the AIX operating system is built very differently from the other CICS products. It uses various components from Transarc, a Pittsburgh based company that specializes in OLTP, e.g. the Encina Server which acts as the transaction coordinator and supports the X/Open XA coordinator interface.

Reference-contexts: Currently about one fifth of CICS/ESA has been specified in Z. These are the core sections which CICS spends 80% of its time executing. There are many Z experts at Hursley and at least two books on the subject have been written by Hursley authors <ref> [McMoPow93] </ref> and [Word92]. 7 4.9 CICS OS/2 CICS OS/2 was introduced in 1988 and with it came support for some other CICS interfaces, e.g.: * Distributed Program Link: The ability for a CICS program to invoke another CICS program across a network, without either program needing to know that the other

Reference-contexts: CICS/6000 (and CICS OS/2) support the External Presentation Interface enabling non-CICS programs to simulate a 3270 terminal to drive existing applications. A similar interface is available on CICS/ESA enabling CICS applications to simulate 3270 devices. See <ref> [StoKnut92] </ref> for more information about CICS/6000. 4.11 The CICS workstation products generally These products tend to be smaller in terms of lines of code than CICS/ESA, reflecting the difference in underlying software. In addition, they come in two flavors, client and server.
