Reference-contexts: The antibody is a clear liquid and is invisible to the human eye once it has dried on a thin-film substrate. The high specificity and affinity to the antibody results in a measurable colorimetric reaction when an antigen binds to the antibody under appropriate thin-film material configuration <ref> [1] </ref>. The test plate containing the antibody is exposed to the sample, either a vapor or liquid stream, to determine if the antigen is present in the sample. <p> 9, or 10, so weight is // subtracted from the array value for these objects. xval = fabs (boundary.left - boundary.right)/2.0 + boundary.left; yval = fabs (boundary.top - boundary.bottom)/2.0 + boundary.top; if ((fabs (x_centroid - xval) &lt; 0.6) && (fabs (y_centroid - yval)&lt; 0.6)) - objs [0] += -10; objs <ref> [1] </ref> += -10; objs [2] += 5; objs [3] += 5; objs [4] += 5; objs [5] += 5; objs [6] += 5; objs [7] += 5; objs [8] += -10; objs [9] += -10; - else Page 4747 // If both the x and y centroid points for both the <p> Otherwise, it is likely to be object 1, 2, 9, or 10, so weight is // added to the array value for these objects. - objs [0] += 5; objs <ref> [1] </ref> += 5; objs [2] += -10; objs [3] += -10; objs [4] += -10; objs [5] += -10; objs [6] += -10; objs [7] += -10; objs [8] += 5; objs [9] += 5; - Once all of the rules have been fired, the actual object associated with the object

Reference-contexts: Since the edges represent boundaries between two regions, boundary-based techniques are used to represent the object boundary and its features.

Reference-contexts: Two approaches are commonly used in the preprocessing phase, edge detection and region segmentation techniques.[5] The popularity of these two methods is fairly equal, with the selection of method based upon the particular application.

Page 55 2.2 Edge Detection The edge detection methods focus primarily on the principle that an edge is the boundary between two regions of different gray scale intensities. Templates can be used to find edges in several different directions. <p> recognition independent of translation, scaling, and rotation, therefore for signals with low levels of expected noise or where it can be adequately filtered, this method may be very successful. 2.8 Genetic Algorithm Page 99 An alternative approach to the standard method of edge detection is using a genetic based algorithm <ref> [8] </ref>. Instead of using the concept that edges are changes in light intensity, this algorithm uses a cost minimization approach to edge detection. The cost minimization uses a heuristic approach where a goodness value is generated to determine the cost of each chromosome or pixel image. <p> However, the tradeoff between Page 1010 computation time and benefits from edge enhancement must be weighed to determine if the results are worth the time.

Reference-contexts: Application of this technique is more appropriate for continuous signals such as EEG and speech patterns. This technique is not appropriate for the application that is to be considered in this project. 2.7 Principal Component Analysis Principal component analysis is an alternate scheme for performing shape recognition <ref> [10] </ref>. In order for principal component analysis to work, edge detection needs to be performed and the shape needs to be represented as a boundary-based representation. In this technique, only the first principal component is used to determine the features. <p> This can be difficult if the input signals are varying or have a large amount of noise present. Automatic recognition algorithms can be difficult if the thresholds need to be varying because the signal to noise ratio is varying. The tests reported in <ref> [10] </ref> were not performed on noisy signals so its usefulness with noisy signals has not been determined.

Reference-contexts: This technique is more suited to a parallel computer system [8]. 2.9 Approximate String Matching Approximate string matching is a technique that uses the curvatures of the boundary to develop a symbolic string representation of image objects and models <ref> [11] </ref>. The representation of the shape and the model is a sequence of numbers representing the angle between the x-axis and the tangent to the shape at each interval. The matching operation is based upon the similarity or difference among the two strings. <p> Modifications can be made to enhance the recognition capabilities of the system by altering the cost function and the manner in which the matrix is formed. This technique is fairly simple and from the testing reported it performed matching satisfactorily <ref> [11] </ref>. 2.10 Hashing Techniques Page 1111 A variation on matching using hashing techniques has also been performed for model acquisition and recognition processes [12]. In this technique, invariants are computed from an object and then used as indices into a lookup table to find references to possible matching models.

Reference-contexts: When a large number of models is needed and an incremental development of the models is required, then this method may be very beneficial. 2.11 Detection of Classes of Objects Another technique that can be used to detect classes of objects is parameter point matching <ref> [13] </ref>. With this method, objects whose parts may move with respect to one another may be classified as well as objects with various shapes and proportions that can Page 1212 be classified into one parametric model. A parameterized point is made up of a location vector, direction, and deformation parameter.

Reference-contexts: Detection of feature points on noisy curved shapes can be very difficult. One approach to the detection of feature points on a noisy curve is to break up the curve into a minimal set of convex and concave sections with a threshold for the maximum deviation from the curve <ref> [14] </ref>. A convex section, Q, of a set of points, P, is defined as a set of contiguous points such that all points in P-Q lie to the right of Q. <p> The main difficulty Page 1313 with this algorithm is determining the maximum deviation tolerance. This should usually be done by examining the curve and its level of noise. This method has been shown to be successful even with very noisy curves <ref> [14] </ref>. Techniques that try to perform curve detection similar to human perception are also being studied [15]. Eight standard curve patterns, four curve segments and four line segments, have been identified to represent curve segments. Curve following rules can be associated with each of the eight curve patterns.

Reference-contexts: This should usually be done by examining the curve and its level of noise. This method has been shown to be successful even with very noisy curves [14]. Techniques that try to perform curve detection similar to human perception are also being studied <ref> [15] </ref>. Eight standard curve patterns, four curve segments and four line segments, have been identified to represent curve segments. Curve following rules can be associated with each of the eight curve patterns. <p> The elimination of noise by basing it on the number of points in the curve is not a very substantial method for noise elimination. Since this work was not supported by thorough testing it needs more research to prove its effectiveness <ref> [15] </ref>. 2.13 Offline Arabic Character Recognition Since ultimately some of the patterns generated by the antibody response may have features similar to that of cursive Arabic characters, the techniques used in an offline Page 1414 Arabic character recognition system may be useful [16].

Reference-contexts: it needs more research to prove its effectiveness [15]. 2.13 Offline Arabic Character Recognition Since ultimately some of the patterns generated by the antibody response may have features similar to that of cursive Arabic characters, the techniques used in an offline Page 1414 Arabic character recognition system may be useful <ref> [16] </ref>. The offline Arabic character recognition system consists of two steps, the preprocessing step where the shape is defined and the recognition step where the pattern and the model are compared. The character representation is done using a clustering based skeletonization algorithm, which converts the character into a tree structure.

Reference-contexts: Chain coding can be used to describe a shape [6] and Polygonal/B-spline approximation can also be used to represent object boundaries [6][14]. Shape features can also be used to represent objects and aid in the pattern recognition process [6]. These features include perimeter, curvature, area, and moments <ref> [19] </ref>. The Hough transformation is a commonly used technique for shape representation using boundary based methods [5]. The Hough transformation parameterizes the shapes into single point representations thereby reducing the complexity of the image. <p> The recognition must take into account the differences in the smaller objects as well as the Page 77 differences in connectivity among the objects. Statistical matching is a feature based technique that uses features that have been defined for a shape to perform shape matching <ref> [19] </ref>. 2.6 Combinatorial Techniques Traditional methods of pattern recognition using the shape representation and matching as two separate processes is often inefficient. Techniques that integrate both feature extraction and matching have been developed by Hu and Ahuja in [9]. They use feature extraction and matching as a signal detection process.

Reference-contexts: This data is then converted into an x-y rectangular image if it is the scan that is to be displayed. Bresenhams circle drawing routine is used to convert the scanned circular data into the image <ref> [20] </ref>. Since the biological aspects of the project have not been completed, it was determined that for proof of principle the raw data be converted into a binary image instead of a gray scale image.
