Reference-contexts: such algorithms is the subject matter of this paper. 1.2 Relation to previous work Most of the existing work on admission control algorithms for multimedia servers has been focussed on developing techniques for providing deterministic service guarantees to clients (i.e., playback requirements are strictly met for the entire service duration) <ref> [1, 5, 9, 11, 13, 15] </ref>. However, since human perception is tolerant to brief distortions in audio and video, providing deterministic guarantees to each client is superfluous. <p> Without loss of any generality, let us assume that clients retrieving strands S 1 ; S 2 ; :::; S n d require deterministic service guarantees, and those retrieving S n d +1 ; ::::; S n are tolerant to brief distortions or loss of information. Let 8i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref>, the level of tolerance for client i be characterized by the the value P i , which denotes the percentage of media blocks of strand S i that must be retrieved on time so as to satisfy the service requirements of the clients. <p> Clearly, since clients retrieving strands S 1 ; S 2 ; :::; S n d require deterministic service guarantees, we get: 8i 2 <ref> [1; n d ] </ref> : P i = 1. On the other hand, for all the tolerant clients, we get: 8i 2 [n d + 1; n] : 0 &lt; P i 1. <p> Let k 1 ; k 2 ; :::; k n denote the number of media blocks of strands S 1 ; S 2 ; :::; S n retrieved during each round. Then, assuming that 8i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> : R i pl denotes the playback rate of strand S i , the playback duration of a round is given by: R = min R i ! On the other hand, the total time spent in retrieving the media blocks from disk during each round (referred to as <p> Furthermore, since the average time spent in retrieving a media block from disk is empirically derived to be b = avg + * fl , the requirements of tolerant clients will not be violated if: b fl n+1 X k i fl P i R (5) where 8i 2 <ref> [1; n d ] </ref> : P i = 1, 8i 2 [n d + 1; n] : 0 &lt; P i 1, and P n+1 = 1. <p> z j starting from location z i , then a sequence for retrieving N media blocks can be considered optimal if it minimizes the sum: = (z 0 ; ! 1 ) + (! 1 ; ! 2 ) + + (! N1 ; ! N ) where 8i 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref> : ! i 2 fz 1 ; z 2 ; :::; z N g, and 8j 2 [1; N ]; j 6= i : ! i 6= ! j . The sequence ! 1 ; ! 2 ; :::; ! N denotes the retrieval sequence. <p> if it minimizes the sum: = (z 0 ; ! 1 ) + (! 1 ; ! 2 ) + + (! N1 ; ! N ) where 8i 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref> : ! i 2 fz 1 ; z 2 ; :::; z N g, and 8j 2 [1; N ]; j 6= i : ! i 6= ! j . The sequence ! 1 ; ! 2 ; :::; ! N denotes the retrieval sequence. <p> In what follows, we present a technique for addressing this problem. Consider a multimedia server that is servicing n clients simultaneously. Let 8i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> : P i denote the percentage of media blocks of strand S i that must be retrieved on time from the multimedia server so as to meet the service requirements of the clients. <p> Assuming that n d clients require deterministic service guarantees, we get 8i 2 <ref> [1; n d ] </ref> : P i = 1. Let the requirements of each of the tolerant clients be met on an average over a period of length I time units. <p> To clarify the exposition of the algorithm, let us assume that ! 0 ; ! 1 ; :::; ! N (! 0 = z 0 , 8i 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref> : ! i 2 fz 1 ; z 2 ; :::; z N g, and i 6= j ) ! i 6= ! j ) denotes the retrieval sequence derived by the greedy al Disk capacity 4 GBytes Number of disks in the array 16 Number tracks per <p> Client requests in each class were generated using a poisson process, with average inter-arrival times of 2, 1, and 1 seconds, respectively. During each round, exactly one block from each of the disks was retrieved for each client (i.e., 8i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> : k i = 1). Since the block size is assumed to be 32 Kbytes, the total amount of media information retrieved during each round is 512 KBytes. Assuming that the playback rate of each strand is 512 Kbytes/s yields R = 1 second.

Reference-contexts: A multimedia server that employs such an observation-based approach is referred to as providing predictive service guarantees to clients (A similar technique was presented by Clark et al. <ref> [3, 7] </ref> for optimizing the utilization of network resource). Notice that the observation-based admission control algorithm offers fairly reliable service, but no absolute guarantees. The admission control decisions are based on the measured characteristics of the current load on the server, rather than theoretical worst-case behavior.

A multimedia server must organize the storage of such media strands on disk (in terms of media blocks) so as to ensure their continuous retrieval at real-time rates <ref> [9] </ref>. Due to the periodic nature of media playback, a multimedia server can service multiple clients simultaneously by proceeding in rounds. During each round, the multimedia server retrieves a sequence of media blocks for each strand.

Reference-contexts: It can be shown that the com plexity of the above algorithm can be reduced to O (N 2 ) by employing bucket sort for ordering the edges in the increasing order of weight. A detailed description of these techniques is provided in <ref> [12] </ref>, and is beyond the scope of this paper. Observe that the greedy algorithm is an off-line algorithm. Hence, it requires that the set of blocks to be retrieved from disk be known a priori.

The number of blocks of each media strand retrieved during a round is dependent on its playback rate requirement, as well as the available buffer space at the client <ref> [13] </ref>. Consequently, ensuring continuous retrieval of each strand requires that the service time (i.e., the total time spent in retrieving media blocks during a round) does not exceed the minimum of the playback durations of the sequences of blocks for each strand retrieved during the round.
