Abstract: The Stop-and-Go service discipline allows a rate-controlled Virtual Circuit to obtain (small) delay-jitter bounds independent of the number of hops along its path. This may prove to be desirable for isochronous applications in wide-area virtual circuit networks. We consider how to integrate the Stop-and-Go and Hierarchical Round Robin service disciplines to allow delay-jitter bounded communication in large homoge
