Abstract: This paper reports on the early stages of a project with four main objectives. First, to achieve a more thorough admixture of systems design with the analysis of the social organization of work. Second, to explore the mutual contribution of ethnographic and participatory approaches to design. Third, to support CSCW in practice, deploying modest and readily-available technology in a real working context. Fourth, to explore some of the characteristics of sthetic production as a substantive domain. It describes some organizational and technical changes developed within a practice of landscape architects in a context of situated experimentation. It maps some of the complex relations between technical change and local and distributed practice. CSCW has been a fertile environment for attempts to meld systems design with analyses of the social organization of work. While much progress has been made, their interpenetration has on the whole remained quite limited, retaining the character of a hand-off between the two activities. This paper reports on the early stages of a project (begun in November 1995) intended to take the liaison further. It also addresses a second major concern: the relationship between ethnographic and participatory approaches to design. Has participatory design anything to gain from the intrusion of the ethnographer? Does the analysis of the social organization of work benefit from action research abandoning its traditional ambition to minimise the effects of its observation, in favour of immediate and continuing implementation of designs which it has informed? Is organizational change rendered easier, more benign or more comprehensible through the combination of approaches? The project involves a practice of landscape architects, one of eight branches of SGS Environment, based in Kendal in the Lake District of north west England. SGS Environment employs around 100 people and its landscape architecture activities are of two main types. Landscape design involves creating visualisations of, and drawings and plans for, a specific change to a specific site. This is often to be used in applications and negotiations for planning consent, eg to a local authority Landscape architecture is concerned with sthetic production. It is creative, open-ended and craft-based; but also professional, technical and quantitative. It therefore unpacks into a very wide range of overlapping practices. Landscape architecture is sthetic production also in the sense that its outputs must do sthetic work. For some purposes a graphic must be precise and photo-realistic for example, a photomontage for planning consent showing the change to a landscape resulting from the introduction of a building. For other purposes, a graphic

Reference-contexts: They have therefore themselves generated the survival strategy of supporting work obtained by other branches. Competitive pressures have also led them to develop specialised skill bases, located in different branches. Together, these mean the necessity to communicate and coordinate within a distributed organization has increased. Bansler & Kraft <ref> [1] </ref>, in a critique of Participatory Design, point out that the trend is for organizations to make use of shrinkwrap software so that custom designs, whether participatory or not, will be increasingly irrelevant. However true this may be in general, it certainly applies to the SME sector.

Reference-contexts: ANT is attentive to mobilisation, punctualization and hand-off, whereas for COP the boundary of a practice is problematic. ANT envisages mutually structuring networks composed of heterogeneous materials, whereas COP perceives members of language games. One emphasises the social construction of science, the other the social production of science <ref> [3] </ref>. Both, in different ways, are concerned with the achievement of social structure. There is not the space to pursue these matters here. 3 work, and in later sections we discuss some of their further implications. The first concerns a photomontage for a famous wetland conservation centre and bird sanctuary.

Reference-contexts: For example, the artisan learns under the master craftsman until he/she can produce a work of art themselves. There is a clear demarcation between learning and producing a work of art. In the majority of the professions today, there is no longer such a clear separation <ref> [6] </ref>. In landscape architecture, the learner normally becomes fully qualified upon taking exams (Part IVs), which are taken after some time has been spent in a practice. In the public sphere, this is formally expressed in the ability to sign legal letters/contracts.

Reference-contexts: But the complexities of this job, which would be typical of many others if distributed production among different offices were to be seriously attempted, mean that something much closer to a distributed community of practice must be supported. Technologies supporting shared screen or distributed conferences seem obvious possibilities <ref> [8] </ref>. The challenges facing this kind of technology in the specific setting include the need to run on both PCs and Macs, being able to incorporate or integrate with existing applications (e.g. Photoshop), perform over a 28.8 Kbps connection, and being in a fairly robust state.
