Title: Grammar Modularization for Efficient Processing: Language Engineering Devices and Their Instantiations  
Author: Axel Theofilidis, Paul Schmid and Thierry Declerck 
Abstract: This paper describes how unification-based grammar development benefits from a modularization methodology resulting in significant efficiency gains without giving up recognized advantages of unification grammars. Gains in efficiency are of such a scale that an industrial deployment of unification grammars seems to become realistic. We introduce a number of devices provided by the ALEP system which support grammar modularization at an operational level, and we illustrate how these devices have been instantiated in the grammatical resources developed in the LS-GRAM project. We conclude with drawing a prospective scenario of modular grammars serving industrial applications.

Reference-contexts: In LS-GRAM, various tagging procedures have been developed for the recognition and markup of all kinds of so called "messy details" occurring in the LS-GRAM corpora such as names, dates, numbers, currency expressions, fixed multi-word units etc. (cf. <ref> [Bredenkamp et al.1996] </ref>): &lt;USR LEVEL="W" VAL="30 Millionen Dollar"&gt; &lt;USR LEVEL="M" TYPE="CURRENCY"&gt; 30_millionen_dollar &lt;/USR&gt; The flow of information from frontends to linguistic processing (or from linguistic processing to backends) is modelled by special declarations - ts_ls_rule declarations establishing correspondences between feature-based linguistic descriptions and the markup of text, i.e. (i) a particular

Reference-contexts: To achieve this, the design of grammars was based on an investigation of coverage requirements for real-life documents of a specific domain (newspaper articles on economy) and on the exploitation of grammar engineering techniques supporting optimal performance (cf. <ref> [Schmidt et al.1996] </ref>). 2 Modular Grammar Design Devices and Instantiations The Advanced Language Engineering Platform (ALEP) that served as the implementation framework of the LS-GRAM project provides a range of devices supporting modularization of grammars, and thus efficiency-oriented grammar engineering in the paradigm of unification 1 LRE 61029: Large-Scale Grammars for
