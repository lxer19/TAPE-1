Abstract: Dynamic burn-in is an important process that is used to improve the reliability of circuits. In this paper, we investigate the problem of computing cyclic sequences which can be used during burn-in of full scan circuits. We show that the problems are computationally difficult. In addition, we demonstrate experimentally that good heuristics can be developed to compute stress test for dynamic burn-in of full scan circuits.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Growing size and complexity of VLSI circuits is making production of reliable chips a challenging task. Environmental stress testing is an effective method for improving product reliability <ref> [1] </ref>. Products often have hidden defects which cause field failures. Of particular concern are failures that occur soon after the end user starts using it ( infant mortality ). Stress testing is a process in which stress stimuli are applied to products to expose such latent defects. <p> Stress testing is a process in which stress stimuli are applied to products to expose such latent defects. Stress tests can be applied in a variety of ways such as burn-in, power cycling, temperature cycling, voltage variations, clock variations etc <ref> [1] </ref>. Burn-in is the process of testing a product for an extended period at an elevated temperature. It is one of the most common form of stress testing [2, 1]. There are three different types of burn-ins : Static, Dynamic and Monitored. <p> Burn-in is the process of testing a product for an extended period at an elevated temperature.

Selection of a particular technique depends upon the types of defects targeted and the extent to which these defects are activated by various techniques [3]. Dynamic burn-in and monitored burn-in are widely used [4, 5]. <p> Highlighted blocks show the places where burn-in and testing are performed. It can be seen that burn-in is performed at two places, once on the bare die and then on the assembled module. In addition to MCMs, burn-in used to separate infant mortalities in many other applications <ref> [1] </ref>. The objective of this research is to compute good stress tests that are to be used during burn-in. We assume that during burn-in stress conditions are induced by raising temperature and applying good set 1 of vectors that generate high switching activity in the targeted part of the circuit. <p> Let c be the last vector of the partial cycle constructed so far. For each vector v 2 V compute the set of nodes which the pair (c; v) switches (step 4.8). These nodes are classified into 10 Bins (Bin <ref> [1] </ref>-[10]). Bin [1] stores the number of nodes that pair (c; v) switches and having average switching activity between 0 and 0.1 Bin [2] stores the number of nodes with activity between 0.1 and 0.2 and so on. (step 4.8) Each Bin has a weight associated with it (BinWeight [i]).

Reference-contexts: We assume that during burn-in stress conditions are induced by raising temperature and applying good set 1 of vectors that generate high switching activity in the targeted part of the circuit. We had proposed the use of cyclic sequences <ref> [6] </ref> which makes it possible to apply them repetitively for an extended period. The idea is to maximize switching activity during application of these cyclic sequences. The issue that we are interested is how to compute such a sequence. <p> The idea is to maximize switching activity during application of these cyclic sequences.

Optimal algorithm and faster heuristics along with experimental results were presented in [6] for computing stress tests for monitored burn-in. Monitored burn-in has several drawbacks. (i) It requires a tester throughout the burn-in process. <p> This is done by classifying the nodes of the circuits and developing different heuristics for each class of nodes. We show that these heuristics are faster and work considerably better than the optimal algorithm used for monitored burn-in <ref> [6] </ref>. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the background and notation used in the paper. In section 3, measure of goodness used to compare the cyclic sequences is discussed along with the problem definition. <p> Intractability of dynamic burn-in problems is discussed in Appendix. 2 Background 2.1 Power Dissipation Model We briefly describe the power dissipation model used in the paper. For more details please refer to <ref> [6] </ref>. Let P d be the power required to charge and discharge the output capacitive load of every gate. <p> Note that with every shift of a vector in the scan chain the inputs to the combinational circuit C change. Equations that take into account the power dissipation during monitored burn-in have been derived in <ref> [6] </ref>. They can be easily modified for dynamic burn-in. For the sake of completeness we briefly describe the equations in Appendix A. We divide the circuit nodes into different categories whose characteristics is exploited while constructing cyclic sequences that maximize switching activity at their output. <p> Nodes which have only scan latches in their fanin are called s-nodes and nodes having both, primary inputs and scan latches in their fanin are called h-nodes (meaning hybrid nodes). 3 Problem Definition Determining measure of goodness of a cycle is an important issue. In <ref> [6] </ref>, average number of nodes switched per clock of the cyclic sequence was used as the measure. It has the following drawback. <p> Average switching of C 1 per clock is 1.7 while that of C 2 is 1.6. According to the measure used in <ref> [6] </ref>, C 1 is better than C 2 . However, it can be seen that in C 1 50% of the nodes have very low activity (10%) and in C 2 100% of the nodes have moderate activity (40%). <p> For s-nodes, cycles generated for monitored burn-in can also be used for dynamic burn-in. We compare the solutions given by optimal algorithm for generation cyclic stress tests for monitored burn-in described in <ref> [6] </ref> with k-lookahead heuristics. Results obtained by the Monitored burn-in heuristic are shown in Table 5. It can be seen that in general lookahead heuristics give much better cycles than that computed for monitored burn-in.

Reference-contexts: The former is approximated by delay models. We use zero delay model under which all gates are assumed to have zero delay. 2.2 Power Dissipation in Full Scan Circuits Block diagram of Full Integrated Scan is shown in Figure 2 <ref> [7] </ref>. C is the combinational part of the circuit and R is the test register where the tests are scanned serially. In dynamic burn-in the output from the combinational circuit is not latched back to the scan chain.
