Reference-contexts: The next natural question is can Maker win faster, i.e., can Maker win if N &lt; R (n; n) and, ultimately, what is the minimal number of moves needed for Maker to win the game. Using the weight function method, Beck <ref> [3] </ref> showed that Maker can win if N &gt; (2 + *) n for n sufficiently large.

Reference-contexts: However, Maker needs to play all the dN (N 1)=4e moves to assure the exsitence of a red K n only. On the other hand, by the Theorem of Erd-os and Selfridge <ref> [9] </ref> (which is essentially the weight function method), Breaker can win the game if N &lt; n2 (n1)=2 . The winning strategy requiring (n 3)2 n1 + n + 1 moves is presented in this paper.
