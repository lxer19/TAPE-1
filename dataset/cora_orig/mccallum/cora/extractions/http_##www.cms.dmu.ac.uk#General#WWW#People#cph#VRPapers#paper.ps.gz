Abstract: AI Planning for many years was concerned with solving problems in small, controlled domains like the Blocksworld, and testing the algorithms on small, pathological problems like the Sussman anomaly. Lately the field has taken on two new goals: to apply planning techniques to more realistic worlds, and to find a better way to validate the research efforts. One solution that is gaining popularity is to provide more-or-less realistic simulated worlds, in which one implements a planner and provides experimental results reflecting its performance. The Tileworld system, reported in [Pollack and Ringuette 1990], confronts three interesting issues: what constitutes a good simulated testbed world for planning research, what constitutes a successful implementation of a planning architecture, and what constitutes experimental validation of such an implementation. This paper examines the program, claims, and experimental results contained in the Tileworld paper, and offers comments about the difficult issues facing a field that is trying to apply its methods to more realistic problems and simultaneously trying to find more rigorous and satisfying ways of measuring its progress. Thanks to Oren Etzioni, Dan Weld, Denise Draper, J. Scott Penberthy, and Mike Williamson, who helped develop the ideas reported herein. Animosity should be directed to the authors alone, however. Martha Pollack and Marc Ringuette were both extremely helpful in providing more detailed information about the Tileworld. Hanks was supported in part by NSF grant IRI-9008670.

Reference-contexts: Of course the real world is neither controlled nor simple, so the question arose whether this model of planning was actually useful in real situations. Particularly troublesome was the idea of generating complete plans ahead of time, so the field took a turn toward the "reactive" planners| <ref> [Agre and Chapman 1987] </ref>, [Schoppers 1987], [Firby 1989] among many others|which did no predictive reasoning. They simply reacted to the immediate sensory inputs, and did whatever seemed best at the time. <p> Relaxing this assumption makes the process of predicting the effects of plans more difficult [Hanks 1990b] and also introduces the concept of reacting to unplanned events as they occur at execution time <ref> [Agre and Chapman 1987] </ref>, [Firby 1989]. It also makes the passage of time more important|the longer one waits, the more the world changes|which brings up a number of issues having to do with the time cost of reasoning.

Reference-contexts: This has led to a line of research centered around taking into account reasoning time when deciding whether and when to plan, and when to act [Russell and Wefald 1989] <ref> [Boddy and Dean 1989] </ref>. The implications for a testbed is that the passage of time must be handled in a realistic way: the world and the agent must be able to operate simultaneously, and to synchronize their actions through well-defined sensing and effecting operations.

Reference-contexts: Multiple Agents Allowing multiple agents to act in the world introduces new problems: how to coordinate behaviors, how the agents should communicate, how the effects of simultaneous actions differ from the effects of those actions performed serially. Multiple-agent planning is an active research area <ref> [Bond and Gasser 1988] </ref> and a good testbed should allow simultaneous and coordinated behavior by the agents that inhabit it. The requirements above mostly concern the testbed's adequacy to represent currently challeng ing research problems. If the testbed is to be used widely for validation purposes, some engineering concerns arise.

Reference-contexts: The Tileworld agent is an implementation of the IRMA architecture 5 , discussed in <ref> [Bratman et al. 1988] </ref> and summarized in Figure 2. IRMA distinguishes among three sorts of reasoning|filtering, deliberating and means-end reasoning|which is reflected in Figure 2. <p> The filtering mechanism is strongly emphasized in <ref> [Bratman et al. 1988] </ref>: the filter must be provide a fast way to reject incompatible options and identify promising ones. <p> This will happen if the new hole's score exceeds the current hole's score by at least the threshold value (recall that the filter threshold is one of the agent parameters). The simplicity of this implementation runs curiously counter to the emphasis <ref> [Bratman et al. 1988] </ref> places on designing a good filter: "an agent's filter override mechanism must be carefully designed to embody the right degree of sensitivity to the problems and opportunities that arise in 12 her environment" (p. 352). <p> The notion of a compatibility filter, for example, is trivial in such an environment, which explains why it wasn't implemented in the Tileworld Agent in any form resembling the discussion in <ref> [Bratman et al. 1988] </ref>. The distinction made between deliberation and means-end reasoning emphasized in [Bratman et al. 1988] is translated into the difference between choosing a hole and filling it, but there is no reason given why that distinction is important in the Tileworld. <p> The notion of a compatibility filter, for example, is trivial in such an environment, which explains why it wasn't implemented in the Tileworld Agent in any form resembling the discussion in <ref> [Bratman et al. 1988] </ref>. The distinction made between deliberation and means-end reasoning emphasized in [Bratman et al. 1988] is translated into the difference between choosing a hole and filling it, but there is no reason given why that distinction is important in the Tileworld. <p> The results show that, at the slow and medium speeds, performance actually degrades as the filter becomes more restrictive. At the fast speed there seems to be no correlation between filtering strategy and performance. This result tends to undercut the emphasis <ref> [Bratman et al. 1988] </ref> places on the filtering mechanism. In the Tileworld it was at best irrelevant and at worst harmful.

Reference-contexts: Effecting and Sensing Sensing and effecting, generally ignored by the classical planners, are neither perfect nor cost free.

Reference-contexts: architecture? The success of a "classical" planner was typically demonstrated by showing that it worked correctly on a small number of canonical problems, the most famous of which was the "Sussman anomaly" [Sussman 1975]. 1 There is currently a desire to subject planning architectures to some sort of experimental validation <ref> [Langley and Drummond 1990] </ref>, and also to develop one or more realistic "testbed worlds" in which to conduct these experiments [Hart and Cohen 1990], [Montgomery and Durfee 1990], [Firby and Hanks 1987]. 1 The term "classical planner" is due to David Wilkins, and it should also be noted that his classical <p> So far we have seen no such arguments coming from those who perform these experiments or advocate the methodology. <ref> [Langley and Drummond 1990] </ref> quite rightly point out that "researchers should attempt to identify the reasons for success or failure on a problem or class of problems, attempting to generalize beyond a specific system and experiment."

Reference-contexts: We noted many features of the real world that planning researchers are currently studying that are not included in the Tileworld. The rationale behind using a small world is best expressed in a paper describing a similar small world: the NASA TileWorld Simulator <ref> [Philips et al. 1991] </ref>. They designed their simulator to isolate three interesting aspects of the planning problem: exogenous events, uncertain action outcomes, and metric time. Other aspects of the world are made as simple as possible. <p> Working on a real-world problem has obvious benefits, but to understand the systems that we build we must isolate attributes and carry out systematic experi mentation. <ref> [Philips et al. 1991, p. 1] </ref> This is a lucid statement of the argument for small, controlled simulated worlds, but it is also a controversial one: defenders of this position must also make the argument that the results and insights gained from this work will indeed "scale up" to the building
