Abstract: Three-dimensional microscopy imaging is important for understanding complex biological assemblies. Computers and digital image acquisition systems have made possible the three-dimensional reconstruction of images obtained from optical microscopes. Since processing such images requires tremendous CPU, storage, and I/O capacities, a high-performance computing facility is necessary in order to achieve real-time performance. However, it is not practical for many medical centers or biological research institutions to operate their own large computer system. One solution is to provide access to remote high-performance computers via high-speed networks. In this paper, we present such a prototype system that integrates microscopy image acquisition, parallel deblurring, 3D image visualization, and high-speed networks. Keywords: Optical Sectioning Microscopy, Deblur-ring, Volume Rendering, Client/Server, Parallel Computing.

Reference-contexts: Five bead images are acquired and averaged as the PSF of the system in our restoration algorithm. The Nearest-Neighbor Deblurring Method. This de-convolution algorithm is a widely used microscopy image deconvolution method <ref> [3] </ref>. The algorithm assumes that the most blurring within a slice is caused by the light scattering from its neighboring slices, one above and one below, and that the intra-plane PSF is much smaller compared with the inter-plane PSF.

Reference-contexts: Client/Server Computing. A client/server suite to transfer images between the medical center of the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory (20 miles distant). The software is based on a high-speed ATM link between Argonne and the university. We have implemented it by using Nexus <ref> [8] </ref>, a runtime task-parallel tool that supports heterogeneous architectures and protocols. We are also implementing it by using CC++, a small set of extensions to C++ for parallel computing.

Reference-contexts: However, on the SGI ONYX, 3D texture mapping, done in hardware, can be used for volume rendering in real time. The Software. Our volume visualization tool uses the 3D texturing hardware the same way as does SGI's vol-ren application <ref> [9] </ref>, and as described in [10][11]. In brief, the data is defined as a 3d texture which is then sam 3 pled by a stack of equally-spaced slicing planes. There are many ways to use 3D texture mapping in direct volume rendering.
