Title: A SURVEY OF THE KREISS MATRIX THEOREM FOR POWER BOUNDED FAMILIES OF MATRICES AND ITS EXTENSIONS  
Author: JOHN C. STRIKWERDA* and BRUCE A. WADE** 
Date: October 1994  
Abstract: We survey results related to the Kreiss Matrix Theorem, especially examining extensions of this theorem to Banach space and Hilbert space. The survey includes recent and established results together with proofs of many of the interesting facts concerning the Kreiss Matrix Theorem.

Reference-contexts: Condition [R] is clearly equivalent to kff (z)k c: It is well known that Abel means are related to Cesaro means, cf. <ref> [1] </ref>, [64], or [71], and this leads naturally to the consideration of the kth Cesaro means of the sequence fa n g 1 n=0 : Cesaro means are important in ergodic theory, cf. [15 ch.5], however there appears to be no direct relation between that theory and the results discussed here.

Reference-contexts: We can decompose A as Re A+iIm A, each of which is normal and so has numerical radius 2 equal to its norm, cf. <ref> [19] </ref>. Also, r I (A) = r I (A fl ). <p> Condition [] is less useful in the variable coefficient case, but it sometimes can be directly verified with = I, cf. <ref> [19] </ref> or [60]. If condition [A] holds with a given constant C; then condition [R] holds with the same constant. The reverse is not true, the constant for condition [A] must grow with the dimension of the space. Tadmor [60] was the first to prove this result. <p> Example: We show that the matrix N can be taken equal to H, but not the converse. Here is an example using a family of a single matrix. F := 2 1 2 : Referring to <ref> [19] </ref>, the numerical radius of A can be computed because it equals the spectral radius of its real part. <p> Additionally, condition [N] is a straight generalization of the condition on the symbol given in [34 1.12], in which the matrix N is the identity.

Reference-contexts: The family of matrices consists of the matrices G (k; h; ~) for values of h; k; and ~; and for variable coefficients, the parameters t and x; as well. For such systems, methods from pseudo-difference operators is required, see Kreiss <ref> [31] </ref>, Lax and Nirenberg [34], Michelson [42], Shintani and Toemeda [53], Yamaguti and Nogi [68], and Wade [65]. 4 In general, the stability of finite difference systems such as (2.2) is equivalent to a family of matrices having powers that are uniformly bounded, such as the estimate (2.4). <p> For proving the stability of variable coefficient finite difference equations it is essential to be able to construct `smooth' matrix families fHg or fN g, cf. [32], <ref> [31] </ref>, [42], [63], [66] and [67]. <p> A theorem similar to Theorem 3.1 by Kreiss <ref> [31] </ref> gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the well-posedness of constant coefficient partial differential equations. 4. Extension of results to Banach Space. An obvious question concerning the Kreiss Matrix Theorem is the possibility of extending the results to a Hilbert space or Banach space setting.

Also, one can find an alternate proof that [] implies [A] by adapting the solution of [24 #221].
