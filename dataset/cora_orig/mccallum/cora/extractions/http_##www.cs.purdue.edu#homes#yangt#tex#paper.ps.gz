Reference-contexts: In section 2 we introduce the image model. In section 3 we discuss some problem about the model. In section 4 we describe the estimation algorithm. And the experimental results will be showed in section 5. 2 Image Model We introduce some notations which are similar to that of <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> A still digital image is a map ~ : V ! f1; 2; : : : ; Qg and is denoted by f~ t : t 2 V g, where ~ t 2 f1; 2; : : : ; Qg. Ordinarily, we take V 1 = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 and L = M for convenience. <p> Assuming that A V 1 , then can be mapped to a digitalized image in the viewing window with certain color assignment map. Throughout the paper we use color assignment map f () defined as follows: f : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! f1; 2; : : : ; Qg i 1 &lt; x Q For any given probability measure which support is in V 1 , we can define a digitized image f t ; t 2 V g as follows: t := f ( max s2V (C s ) <p> We call W i ; p i ; i = 1; 2; : : : ; N , which satisfies the above conditions, an IFS <ref> [1] </ref>. We call A the attractor of IFS, the invariant measure of IFS, and f () the constructed image of IFS. The concept of IFS can be generalized [3][4]. <p> The concept of IFS can be generalized [3][4]. For convenience of discussion only IFS satisfying the above conditions are considered in the present paper. 3 Discussion of the Model Barnsley <ref> [1] </ref> provided a simulation algorithm to construct a digitized image from IFS, which is based on the point-wise ergodic theorem [4] for Markov process with p (x; B) as its transition probability. A more detailed description of the algorithm is as follows. <p> The solution of the inverse problem is difficult and has great significance to image compression <ref> [1] </ref>. Before discussing the inverse problem a natural question is whether any digitized image can be constructed approximately by some IFS at a tolerable error. The following theorem answers this question. <p> Numerical experiments of the estimation algorithm and its application to image compression are studied. 11 A Proof of Theorem 1 Without losing generality we assume that V 1 = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 and L = M = n, i.e. [0; 1] 2 is partitioned into n 2 sub-squares. <p> Numerical experiments of the estimation algorithm and its application to image compression are studied. 11 A Proof of Theorem 1 Without losing generality we assume that V 1 = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 and L = M = n, i.e. [0; 1] 2 is partitioned into n 2 sub-squares.

Reference-contexts: The inverse problem, finding a reasonably simple IFS which reproduces a given image, is difficult and interesting. [5] presented a method for solving inverse problem, which was based on Collage Theorem [5]. But it is difficult to find an algorithm for Collage Theorem. <ref> [3] </ref> provided an iterated estimation algorithm for invariant measure of IFS, which was based on moments of invariant measure. But the algorithm is nonlinear and the numerically experimental results were not satisfactory [5]. Moreover, it seems that it is difficult to estimate the error in their method. <p> exists an unique compact set A in &lt; 2 , called the attractor of W i ; i = 1; 2; : : : ; N, such that A = [ N where W i (A) := fx 2 &lt; 2 : x = W i (y); y 2 Ag <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> The proof is in Appendix B. The condition (i) is not very restrictive in image computation. But the condition (ii) may not be satisfied by many IFS <ref> [3] </ref>. In present paper the existence of density function up to Lebesgue measure will not be discussed. We plan to use (7) to get an approximation formula for f (C t ); t 2 V g. Not that (C t ) = C t where d means Lebesgue measure.

Reference-contexts: The idea is to recognize the image as the invariant measure for some Markov process which converges in distribution to this measure. This is valuable for image compression if transition probability of the process is fairly simple, even though the image itself is complicated <ref> [4] </ref>. IFS, used to construct image, comprises of several affine transformations and corresponding probability parameters. The transition probability is determined by the affine transformations and probability parameters. With a color assignment map the invariant measure of the transition probability is transformed to an image data. <p> The concept of IFS can be generalized [3]<ref> [4] </ref>. For convenience of discussion only IFS satisfying the above conditions are considered in the present paper. 3 Discussion of the Model Barnsley [1] provided a simulation algorithm to construct a digitized image from IFS, which is based on the point-wise ergodic theorem [4] for Markov process with p (x; B) as its transition probability. A more detailed description of the algorithm is as follows. <p> In fact, as K converges to infinite, n t K converges to (C t ), where u is the invariant measure of fW i ; p i ; i = 1; 2; : : : ; Ng <ref> [4] </ref>. Thus f t ; t 2 V g is an approximation of ff ((C t )); t 2 V g.
