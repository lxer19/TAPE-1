Abstract: Given a physical system, there are experts who have knowledge about how this system operates. In some cases, there exists quantitative knowledge in the form of deep models. One of the main issues dealing with these different types of knowledge is "how does one address the difference between the two model types, each of which represents a different level of knowledge about the system?" We have devised a method that starts with 1) the expert's knowledge about the system, and 2) a quantitative model that can represent all or some of the behavior of the system. This method then adjusts the knowledge in either the rule-based system or the quantitative system to achieve some degree of consistency between the two representations. Through checking and resolving the inconsistencies, we provide a way to obtain better models in general about systems by exploiting knowledge at all levels, whether qualitative or quantitative.

Reference-contexts: Generally speaking, fuzzy sets may be viewed as an attempt to deal with a type of imprecision which arises when the boundaries of classes are not sharply defined. A fuzzy set A of a universe of discourse X is characterized by a membership function A : X ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> which associates with each element x of X a number A (x) in the interval [0, 1] which represents the grade of membership of x in A. <p> A fuzzy set A of a universe of discourse X is characterized by a membership function A : X !
