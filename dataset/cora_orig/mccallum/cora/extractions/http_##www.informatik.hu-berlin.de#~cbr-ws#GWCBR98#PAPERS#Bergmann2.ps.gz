Abstract: Although several systematic analyses of existing approaches to adaptation have been published recently, a general formal adaptation framework is still missing. This paper presents a step into the direction of developing such a formal model of transformational adaptation. The model is based on the notion of the quality of a solution to a problem, while quality is meant in a more general sense and can also denote some kind of appropriateness, utility, or degree of correctness. Adaptation knowledge is then defined in terms of functions transforming one case into a successor case. The notion of quality provides us with a semantics for adaptation knowledge and allows us to define terms like soundness, correctness and completeness. In this view, adaptation (and even the whole CBR process) appears to be a special instance of an optimization problem.

Reference-contexts: try to come up with some relaxed versions of these properties, e.g., in a more PAC-like manner. 5 Similarity It might strike one's mind that we have not yet spoken about the concept of similarity, although usually considered the key concept in CBR. 3 The undecidablity result for action planning <ref> (Bylander, 1991) </ref> can be used to show this property. Similarity for retrieving cases Similarity measures are usually used for selecting an appropriate case during retrieval.

Reference-contexts: Let C = P fi S fi R be the space of all cases, and the case base CB C is a finite set of cases. A case representation of that kind was already suggested by Kolodner <ref> (Kolodner, 1993) </ref> (p. 147, 158ff.). Besides problem and solution, she also introduces a third component of a case called outcome. The outcome is the resulting state of the world when the solution is carried out.

Reference-contexts: This view on adaptation knowledge extends the traditional view of transformational adaptation since we propose that the problem, the solution, and the quality value may get modified. Traditionally, only the solution of the retrieved case is modified. The adaptation knowledge container <ref> (Richter, 1995) </ref> A is a set of adaptation operators A = fff 1 ; ff 2 ; : : :g. We can now state what soundness of the adaptation knowledge means. Definition 2 (Soundness of an adaptation operator, the adaptation container) An adaptation operator ff is sound w.r.t. <p> From these considerations we can see, that we can move all the domain knowledge that is usually captured in a similarity measure of pure case retrieval systems into adaptation operators of our more general knowledge. This is another instance of the observation by Richter <ref> (Richter, 1995) </ref> that in principle, every container of a CBR system can hold any knowledge.

Reference-contexts: A) applied to the current problem ^p and a case c delivers a similarity value which is a function of the best quality of the solution we can obtain by adapting the case c to the current problem ^p. Hence, this similarity measures guarantees to retrieve adaptable cases <ref> (Smyth and Keane, 1994) </ref>. Retrieval-only systems It might be surprising that in this model, similarity measures don't encode new domain knowledge since there are many pure retrieval systems in which similarity measures do in fact encode domain knowledge. <p> From that we can conclude that we should start thinking about the adaptation knowledge and only afterwards start to determine the similarity measure particularly suited for the present adaptation knowledge. This intuition was already present in the work by Smyth and Keane <ref> (Smyth and Keane, 1994) </ref>, but we now have a formal justification for it. From our considerations, case retrieval and adaptation can be viewed as a special kind of optimization problem, i.e., finding an optimal solution to a problem.

Reference-contexts: For pure case retrieval systems, there is a good theory and mathematical formalization focusing on similarity measures, preference relations, and related properties of the similarity measures and retrieval algorithm like correctness and completeness <ref> (Wess, 1995) </ref>. This solid foundation laid the ground for the success of such systems in practice. For CBR systems which include adaptation such a formalization is still missing. This paper presents a step into the direction of developing a formal model of transformational adaptation.
