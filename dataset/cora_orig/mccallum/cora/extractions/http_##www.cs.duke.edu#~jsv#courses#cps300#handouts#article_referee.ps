Abstract: Your success as a scientist will in part be measured by the quality of your research publications in high-quality journals and conference proceedings. Of the three classical rhetorical techniques, it is logos, rather than pathos or ethos, which is most commonly associated with scientific publications. In the mathematical sciences the paradigm for publication is to describe the mathematical proofs of propositions in sufficient detail to allow duplication by interested readers. Quality control is achieved by a system of peer review commonly referred to as refereeing. This guide is an attempt to distill the experience of the theoretical computer science community on the subject of refereeing into a convenient form which can be easily distributed to students and other inexperienced referees. Although aimed primarily at theoretical computer scientists, it contains advice which may be relevant to other mathematical sciences. It may also be of some use to new authors who are unfamiliar with the peer review process. However, it must be understood that this is not a guide on how to write papers. Authors who are interested in improving their writing skills can consult the "Further Reading" section. The main part of this guide is divided into nine sections. The first section describes the Editorial process, the role of the referee within it, and some potential benefits of being a good referee. The second expands on the referee's role in enforcing quality control. The third describes the major categories of research papers. The fourth addresses the difficult subject of ethical behaviour in a referee. The fifth attempts to solve some common dilemmas that new referees may experience. The sixth describes the major categories of referee's reports. The seventh discusses the referee's obligation to improve the technical writing of the paper. The eighth describes the correspondence between the Editor and the referee. The ninth contains pointers to further information on the processes of scientific writing, refereeing, and Editing.

Reference: <editor> The Bibliography should be correct (the attributed results must appear in the referenced paper), </editor> <title> accurate (the right volume and page number, etc.), up-to-date (recent breakthroughs and accepted history should be acknowledged), and accessible (crucial references should not be to papers that are "in print", or in obscure or out-of-print publications). The reference list should not be over-done. Only papers that are truly relevant should be mentioned. Every paper in the reference list should be referred to at some point in the text. Correspondence The correspondence between Editor and referee usually follows a set pattern. </title> <type> 15 </type>
Reference: 1. <author> The Request: </author> <title> The Editor's initial request to the referee will typically be via a form-letter accompanied by a manuscript. The manuscript should be returned if the referee refuses the commission. </title>
Reference: 2. <author> The Reply: </author> <title> Some Editors want a formal reply, whilst others are more laissez faire. Some include a reply card which is returned by the referee if the commission is accepted. </title>
Reference: 3. <author> The Reminder: </author> <title> If, after what the Editor considers to be a reasonable amount of time, </title> <note> no report is received, the referee will receive a reminder that it is overdue. </note>
Reference: 4. <institution> The Report: </institution> <note> The referee submits a formal report accompanied by a cover letter. </note>
Reference: 5. <author> The Resubmission: </author> <title> The Editor notifies the author of his or her decision, including anonymous copies of the referees' reports. The author is given a chance to respond, and if the Editor feels it is warranted, resubmit the paper after revision. The Editor may choose to send the revised version of the paper to the referees for a second, and (exceptionally) a third pass. </title>
Reference: 6. <editor> The Thank-you Note: </editor> <title> Once the final decision has been reached, most Editors will acknowledge the referee's effort with a short form-letter expressing gratitude. </title>
