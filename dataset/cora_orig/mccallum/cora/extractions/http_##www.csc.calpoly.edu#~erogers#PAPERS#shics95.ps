Abstract: There is an increasing need in complex environments for computerized assistance, both for the effective filtering and display of pertinent information or data, and also for the decision-making task itself. The combination of artificial intelligence techniques with image processing and graphics capabilities provides the foundation for building intelligent systems which act as mediaries between the human and the task domain. In the field of tele-assistance, this type of system enables cooperative problem-solving between a remote semi-autonomous robot and a local human supervisor. This paper describes current work on such a system, with an emphasis on the development of knowledge-based image enhancement capabilities. These allow the intelligent assistant to request particular images related to a failure state, and to automatically enhance those images in such a manner that the local supervisor may quickly and effectively make a decision.

Reference-contexts: Advanced robotics still has a need for keeping the "human in the loop" for two main reasons: 1) to observe the evolution and state of the robot, and 2) to compensate for the information and decision-making inadequacies of the robot <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The intelligent assistant uses a blackboard architecture to observe and manage the information posted independently by the remote and human intelligences. Blackboards have been previously used successfully for teleoperation by Edwards et al <ref> [2] </ref> in the Ground Vehicle Manager's Associate project and by Pang and Shen [6] for the high level programming and control of mobile robots to assist the operation of the emergency response team involved in a hazardous material spill.

Reference-contexts: Systems such as Lyons and Allton's work on a planetary rover, which is designed to cooperate with a human user in the task of geological sampling and field-work already demonstrate many of these concepts <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the highly modular and adaptive nature of the systems is expected to support the incremental evolution of telesystems to full autonomy. BACKGROUND The approach taken in our project is to combine the autonomous perceptual and motor control abilities of the Sensor Fusion Effects (SFX) architecture for mobile robots <ref> [4] </ref> with the intelligent supervisory assistance provided by the VIA system. This work is a collaborative effort between researchers at Clark Atlanta University and Colorado School of Mines; the latter houses the mobile robot laboratory which is providing the testbed for the tele-assistance experiments.

Reference-contexts: The assistant must also coordinate the display of relevant contextual information such as terrain or cartographic data, imagery-related data (weather conditions, etc.), and general information (e.g., <ref> [5] </ref>). SYSTEM OVERVIEW A diagram of the current system design is shown in figure 1 [11]. The teleVIA blackboard is the central structure of the cooperative intelligent assistant since it is where the evolutionary results of the problem-solving effort are captured.

Reference-contexts: when a component (e.g., a sensor, an actuator) fails in the system, canceling an autonomous capability of the machine, or even when a change in human operator takes place with the new operator not knowledgeable of given procedures, roles, or capabilities which himself and/or the machine are expected to exhibit <ref> [7] </ref>. Current telesystems are challenged by problems of prohibitively high communication bandwidth and human supervisor fatigue due to repetitive tasks, poor displays, and the demands of too much data and too many simultaneous activities to monitor, especially in cases of robot failure.

Reference-contexts: Our original work began in the field of diagnostic radiology, and extensive human protocol studies led to the development of a cognitive model of visual interaction, which formed the basis for the first intelligent assistance program, called VIA (Visual Interaction Assistant) <ref> [8] </ref>. The blackboard-based architecture of the VIA system was chosen to facilitate the opportunistic problem-solving needed for complex and ill-structured applications, and evaluation of a preliminary prototype for radiologists, (VIA-RAD), demonstrated some promising results, both in performance and in acceptance by the users [10]. <p> The original logical partitioning of the blackboard into Context Panel, Perceptual Panel, Hypothesis Panel and Attention Panel was based on components of the cognitive model of visual interaction described in <ref> [8] </ref>. In the domain of tele-assistance, similar logical partitions or panels are used, but they reflect a somewhat different emphasis as described below. In the general VIA design, the Context Panel contains information that is known about the overall problem context.

Reference-contexts: Deliberate landmark search, on the other hand, reflected a systematic examination of known landmarks in the image. This occurred either in the absence of immediate visual capture, or to seek further nonobvious abnormalities <ref> [9] </ref>. In the teleVIA system, there is not a single static image presented for diagnosis. Rather, the system must first decide which images to display at all.

The application of this approach to the field of tele-assistance has exploited the fundamental need for more effective interaction between the local human supervisor and remote semi-autonomous robots.
