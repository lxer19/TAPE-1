Reference-contexts: A regular submesh consists therefore of quadrilaterals and 4-valent points. On this mesh a surface formed as a linear combination of the shifts of the 4-direction box spline, called the Zwart-Powell element ([11],[7]), is defined by the following subdivision process (c.f. <ref> [1] </ref>, [8]). 2 a b ! 2a+b+c 4 2b+a+d 4 4 4 At each step replicate each coefficient with index (i; j) in a new array at positions (2i; 2j), (2i + 1; 2j), (2i; 2j + 1), and (2i + 1; 2j + 1). <p> We conclude with three examples of modified midedge subdivision. To distribute the change of normal and keep some features sharp, we parametrize the mask in the first subdivision double-step only as follows (cf. [5]): 1fl fl 1fl fl 2 <ref> [0:5; 1] </ref>: vergence for large facets. 8 In the extreme case, setting fl = 1 at a vertex results in a sharp point and setting fl = 1 for the two vertices of an edge results in a sharp edge. Conversely, setting fl = 0:5 at a point, smoothes maximally.

Reference-contexts: A regular submesh consists therefore of quadrilaterals and 4-valent points. On this mesh a surface formed as a linear combination of the shifts of the 4-direction box spline, called the Zwart-Powell element ([11],[7]), is defined by the following subdivision process (c.f. [1], <ref> [8] </ref>). 2 a b ! 2a+b+c 4 2b+a+d 4 4 4 At each step replicate each coefficient with index (i; j) in a new array at positions (2i; 2j), (2i + 1; 2j), (2i; 2j + 1), and (2i + 1; 2j + 1).

Reference-contexts: For almost all inputs, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the subdivision matrix determine the smoothness of the limit surface <ref> [9] </ref>. The conversion to the Bernstein form in the preceeding section shows that 3 layers of control points suffice to define a complete new surface layer x m that attaches to a previous layer x m1 .

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1 On a regular mesh, midedge subdivision converges to a surface parametrized by shifts of the 4-direction box-spline. Proof Two steps of the midedge subdivision equal one step of the 4-direction box spline subdivision. (see also <ref> [10] </ref> p280). 2 Since we know the limit surface for regular mesh regions, we will in the following always combine two steps of midedge subdivision and refer to it as a double-step.
