Abstract: The formal semantics of MSC only considers the meaning of a single MSC. Composition techniques, in particular so-called conditions, are not treated. In this paper we will discuss possible approaches towards the semantics of condi tions.

Reference-contexts: The first option consideres Y and Z alternatives in the sense of the non-deterministic alternative composition operator +. The second option adopts the delayed choice operator for alternatives (See <ref> [BM95] </ref>).

We will try to transpose the approaches from these two papers to the process algebraic setting in which the current semantics of MSC is defined.
