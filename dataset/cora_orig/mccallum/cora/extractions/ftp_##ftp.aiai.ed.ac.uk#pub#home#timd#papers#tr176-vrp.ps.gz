Abstract: Distribution is a substantial cost in many companies and in some sectors it contributes a high percentage of the value added to goods. Therefore the potential for savings is large, and there is much interest in improving distribution efficiency. The Vehicle Routing Problem (vrp) is an abstraction of a class of problems that has been studied both as a theoretical problem and for its practical relevance to applications. In this paper we investigate Neighbourhood Search techniques for solving the vrp and describe some experiments with variations on the approach applied to a set of benchmark problems.

Reference-contexts: Obviously the size of the ts's candidate list is an important factor and one would intuitively feel that larger population sizes for gas would also be better. Although we have not examined this here, <ref> [Alander 92] </ref> suggests that between n and 2n is the ideal population size. This would make our choice of 100 about right for the datasets we were looking at.

Reference-contexts: In the next section we briefly outline these methods and show how they can be applied to the vrp. In the following section we report some experimental comparisons of systems embodying ideas from both Genetic Algorithms and Tabu Search, applied to a set of benchmark problems <ref> [Beasley 90] </ref>. 2 2 Neighbourhood Search 2.1 Genetic Algorithms Genetic Algorithms (ga) are based on an analogy with biological evolution. A population of chromosomes (i.e. strings representing possible solutions) is maintained. New chromosomes are produced by combining members of the population, and these replace existing chromosomes. <p> Naturally the size of the penalty should be proportional to the degree of constraint violation. 3 Experiments In this section we describe some experiments applying these ideas to a set of problems from the or library <ref> [Beasley 90] </ref>. A number of variations were incorporated into the scheduling system and each was tested with the datasets vrpnc1, vrpnc2, vrpnc3, vrpnc6, and vrpnc14 (originally drawn from [Christofides et al 79]).

Reference-contexts: Currently methods such as Genetic Algorithms and Tabu Search (see [Reeves 93] for overviews) are popular within Artificial Intelligence and or circles. Constraint satisfaction (csp) methods have not yet been very successful, e.g. <ref> [Christodoulou et al 94] </ref> had to extend their csp approach with local search techniques. Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithms belong to a class of methods known as Neighbourhood Search.

Reference-contexts: Therefore the potential for savings is large and there is much interest in improving distribution efficiency. The Vehicle Routing Problem (vrp) is an abstraction of a class of problems that has been studied both as a theoretical problem and for its practical relevance to applications <ref> [Christofides et al 79, Osman 93] </ref>. There are a number of extensions to the vrp, however the basic problem consists of a set of customers to be served by a fleet of vehicles from a single depot (see Figure 1). <p> Historically the focus in Operational Research (or) has been on methods for generating a feasible solution which can then be improved through local search <ref> [Christofides et al 79] </ref>. Currently methods such as Genetic Algorithms and Tabu Search (see [Reeves 93] for overviews) are popular within Artificial Intelligence and or circles. <p> A number of variations were incorporated into the scheduling system and each was tested with the datasets vrpnc1, vrpnc2, vrpnc3, vrpnc6, and vrpnc14 (originally drawn from <ref> [Christofides et al 79] </ref>). The first three of these contain data for 50, 75, and 100 customers respectively, with capacity restrictions on vehicles but none on distance. The vrpnc6 dataset is vrpnc1 with the additional restriction that no route can exceed 200 units of distance. <p> Judging whether this has occurred or not is difficult, however we note that most of the graphs are beginning to level off by 300 cycles and that the results are not as good as those reported in <ref> [Christofides et al 79] </ref>. The operators used here seem to have been reasonably effective in generating new solutions. Swapping on its own does not appear as effective as relinking. This may be because the latter produces larger changes.

Reference-contexts: Nearest Neighbour: It has sometimes been suggested that seeding a ga with a good initial solution leads to better results [Reeves 93]. There are many algorithms for constructing feasible solutions (e.g. the well known "savings" algorithm of <ref> [Clarke & Wright 64] </ref>). We decided to try a very simple one: first a customer is picked at random, then the customer's five nearest neighbours are considered. The route is extended by adding the nearest unassigned customer which does not violate the weight or distance constraints.

Reference-contexts: This may be because the latter produces larger changes. On the other hand relinking sometimes reaches a plateau and swapping or inserting may help to get the system 11 out of it. It would also have been possible to use other operators such as uniform order-based crossover <ref> [Davis 91] </ref> in the ga. This is a modified crossover which maintains the structure of sequence-based chromosomes.

Reference-contexts: As a generalisation of the Travelling Salesman Problem the vrp is np-hard <ref> [Lenstra & Rinnooy Kan 81] </ref>, i.e. there are no known methods for finding the optimal solution within polynomial time. Historically the focus in Operational Research (or) has been on methods for generating a feasible solution which can then be improved through local search [Christofides et al 79].

As a generalisation of the Travelling Salesman Problem the vrp is np-hard [Lenstra & Rinnooy Kan 81], i.e. there are no known methods for finding the optimal solution within polynomial time.
