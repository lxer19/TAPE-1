Abstract: The problem of trajectory tracking in the presence of input constraints is considered. The desired trajectory is reparameterized on a slower time scale in order to avoid input saturation. Necessary conditions that the reparameterizing function must satisfy are derived. The deviation from the nominal trajectory is minimized by formulating the problem as an optimal control problem.

Reference-contexts: A more geometric description of condition (12) may be found in <ref> [14] </ref>. Since many reference trajectories may not satisfy this necessary condition, we ask whether we can satisfy necessary condition (12) by reparameterizing the desired trajectory r (t) to r (s (t)). Note that the system still traverses the same trajectory in output space but on a different time scale. <p> One has to ensure that z d , which is essentially an input to the inverse dynamics, does not steer the zero dynamics and the state out of X, the region where feedback linearization is valid. For sufficient conditions which ensure this problem does not happen, see <ref> [14] </ref>. 2.4 Asymptotic Tracking Without Inverse Dynamics We consider using reparameterization to avoid saturation in asymptotically tracking a reference trajectory. In case the tracking error is large, reparameterization will slow down the desired trajectory and distribute more control authority to stabilizing the tracking error. <p> This may potentially place restrictions on how large the initial error e can be. For sufficient conditions on the initial error which guarantee that z 2 (X) see <ref> [14] </ref>. We will again use a reperameterization algorithm in order to avoid saturation. The only difference in this case is the addition of the tracking error.
