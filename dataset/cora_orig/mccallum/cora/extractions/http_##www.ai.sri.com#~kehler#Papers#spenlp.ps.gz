Abstract: The SpeechActs system is a testbed for building computer applications utilizing continuous speech input and speech synthesis output. It supports a variety of speech recognition (SR) systems and text-to-speech (TTS) generators; our main goal is to produce a generalized interface scheme allowing new research systems to be substituted easily. The essential components of the system, in addition to the externally-developed SR and TTS modules, are our natural language interpreter SWIFTUS, our Unified Grammar (UG) compiler, and the discourse manager. SWIFTUS provides the tools necessary to easily develop natural language interfaces between SR systems and end applications that exhibit a suitable granularity of analysis. The Unified Grammar compiler creates grammars supporting a variety of SR systems and NLP modules from one, module-independent formalism. The discourse manager is currently an under-developed prototype that coordinates user interactions between a co-existing suite of different speech applications. To date, several prototypes have been developed for a variety of end applications using several different SR and TTS systems.
