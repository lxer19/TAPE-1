Title: Automated Decomposition of Model-based Learning Problems

Abstract: A new generation of sensor rich, massively distributed autonomous systems is being developed that has the potential for unprecedented performance, such as smart buildings, reconfigurable factories, adaptive traffic systems and remote earth ecosystem monitoring. To achieve high performance these massive systems will need to accurately model themselves and their environment from sensor information. Accomplishing this on a grand scale requires automating the art of large-scale modeling. This paper presents a formalization of decompositional, model-based learning (DML), a method developed by observing a modeler's expertise at decomposing large scale model estimation tasks. The method exploits a striking analogy between learning and consistency-based diagnosis. Moriarty, an implementation of DML, has been applied to thermal modeling of a smart building, demonstrating a significant improvement in learning rate.

Reference-contexts: The focus there is on graphical models representing probabilistic influence, where the graphical information implicitly used by DML represents deterministic influences. More recent work on Bayesian learning incorporates connec-tives representing deterministic relations. Recent work in the qualitative reasoning community has also focussed on automated modeling for estimation. <ref> (Kay & Ungar 1993) </ref> uses a deterministic monotone influence diagram to bias estimation, (Bradley & Stolle ) presents a series of symbolic methods for generat-ing model-bsed estimation codes.

Reference-contexts: DML is a key element of a larger program to develop model-based autonomous systems (MBAs). MBAs achieve unprecedented performance through capabilities for self-modeling (e.g., DML) and self-configuration. A complement to Mo-riarty, called Livingstone, performs discrete modeling and self-configuration <ref> (Williams & Nayak 1996) </ref>, and will fly a deep space probe in 1988. Our work on DML was developed in the context of synthesizing an optimal heating and cooling control system for a smart, self-modeling building.

Reference-contexts: What is important is that the existence of this error results from the model being overdetermined by the sensed variables. 6 In an additional stage, not presented here (see (Zhang, Williams, & Elrod 1993)), these three estimators were in turn simplified using dominance arguments (in the spirit of <ref> (Williams & Raiman 1994) </ref>) to a set of six estimators, one requiring two unknown parameters to be estimated, and the remaining involving only one unknown. e 0 and s 0 need not be the complete system of equations and sensed variables he; si.

Reference-contexts: The power of this condition is that it doesn't require knowledge of the form of an equation, just the variables each equation interacts with. Hence using this condition DML is able to decompose a graph of interactions <ref> (Williams 1990) </ref> into estimation subproblems, without restriction on, or further knowledge about, the form of the underlying equations. This is in the spirit of graphical learning methods, such as (Buntine 1994; Shachter, Anderson, & Poh 1990).

Reference-contexts: synthesis process we built a testbed for fine grained sensing and control of a building, called the responsive environment (et al. 1993b; 1993a), and used this testbed to study the manual art of our control engineers at decomposing the model estimation and optimal control components of the overall control problem <ref> (Zhang, Williams, & Elrod 1993) </ref>. A key insight offered by our study is that the process of decomposing a large model estimation problem is analogous to that used in model-based diagnosis to solve large scale multiple fault diagnosis problems. <p> What is important is that the existence of this error results from the model being overdetermined by the sensed variables. 6 In an additional stage, not presented here (see <ref> (Zhang, Williams, & Elrod 1993) </ref>), these three estimators were in turn simplified using dominance arguments (in the spirit of (Williams & Raiman 1994)) to a set of six estimators, one requiring two unknown parameters to be estimated, and the remaining involving only one unknown. e 0 and s 0 need not
