Reference-contexts: Common practice is to demand that these points are very evenly distributed in the t-dimensional unit hypercube <ref> [0; 1] </ref> t . Of course, points that are too uniformly distributed do not look random and fail to imitate i.i.d. uniform variates as well as points whose distribution is too far from even. <p> One can imagine a large box containing all the points of t . If those points are very evenly distributed over <ref> [0; 1] </ref> t , then a good way to generate an i.i.d. sample from (approximately) the uniform distribution over [0; 1] would be to pick up points randomly from this box, with replacement , and use all the components of each vector. <p> One can imagine a large box containing all the points of t . If those points are very evenly distributed over <ref> [0; 1] </ref> t , then a good way to generate an i.i.d. sample from (approximately) the uniform distribution over [0; 1] would be to pick up points randomly from this box, with replacement , and use all the components of each vector. <p> When the set of points produced by the generator is viewed as a random sample taken form t , then it makes sense to have t as evenly distributed as possible over <ref> [0; 1] </ref> t . This argument also suggests that RNGs should have huge periods, many orders of magnitude larger than whatever can be exhausted in practice. Good equidistribution over the whole period improves our confidence in good statistical behavior over the fraction of the period that we use. <p> For specific examples, see [?, ?, ?, ?]. Tausworthe and GFSR generators also have a lattice structure in the space of formal series, and that structure can also be used to analyze the geometrical distribution of the points t . Let m = 2 and partition the unit hypercube <ref> [0; 1] </ref> t into 2 t` cubic cells of equal size. It each cell contains the same number of points of t (with the possible exception of the zero vector), we say that the sequence is (t; `)-equidistributed .
