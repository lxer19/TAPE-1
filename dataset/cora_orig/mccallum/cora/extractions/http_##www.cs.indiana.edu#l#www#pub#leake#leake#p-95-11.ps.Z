Title: Learning to Improve Case Adaptation by Introspective Reasoning and CBR

Abstract: In current CBR systems, case adaptation is usually performed by rule-based methods that use task-specific rules hand-coded by the system developer. The ability to define those rules depends on knowledge of the task and domain that may not be available a priori, presenting a serious impediment to endowing CBR systems with the needed adaptation knowledge. This paper describes ongoing research on a method to address this problem by acquiring adaptation knowledge from experience. The method uses reasoning from scratch, based on introspective reasoning about the requirements for successful adaptation, to build up a library of adaptation cases that are stored for future reuse. We describe the tenets of the approach and the types of knowledge it requires. We sketch initial computer implementation, lessons learned, and open questions for further study.

Reference-contexts: Although much progress has been made in methods for case retrieval, both the American and European CBR communities have identified case adaptation as a particularly challenging open problem for the field (e.g., <ref> [1, 18] </ref>). The problem is so acute that the most effective current strategy for building CBR applications is to bypass adaptation entirely, building advisory systems that provide cases to human users who perform the adaptation themselves (e.g., [2, 14]).

Reference-contexts: The problem is so acute that the most effective current strategy for building CBR applications is to bypass adaptation entirely, building advisory systems that provide cases to human users who perform the adaptation themselves (e.g., <ref> [2, 14] </ref>). However, despite the practical benefits of retrieval-only advisory systems, successful use of advisory systems may require considerable user expertise. Consequently, automatic case adaptation is important from a practical perspective, not only to enable CBR systems to perform autonomously but to enable them to aid naive users.

Reference-contexts: In many of those contexts, the knowledge acquisition problem has been significantly ameliorated by the use of case-based reasoning. Consequently, it is natural to consider applying CBR to the case adaptation process itself, replacing pre-defined adaptation rules with adaptation cases that reflect prior adaptation experience <ref> [3, 17, 29] </ref>. An important question is the source of the needed library of adaptation cases. We propose a method that starts with a library of domain-independent adaptation rules, using them to solve novel adaptation problems. <p> In these systems, however, the adaptation information learned is quite domain and task specific, while memory search cases have more flexibility. The use of CBR for case adaptation has also been advocated by Berger <ref> [3] </ref>, in the context of storing and re-using an expert's adaptations.

Reference-contexts: For example, in the radiation treatment planning domain, the general rule add a step to remove harmful side-effect can be replaced by specific rules such as add the step "rotate radiation sources" to remove harmful side-effect "excess radiation" <ref> [4] </ref>. Both these approaches exhibit the classic operationality/generality tradeoff from explanation-based learning (e.g., [28]). Abstract rules have generality: a small set of transformations appears sufficient to characterize a wide range of adaptations [5, 15]. However, abstract rules are difficult to apply.

Reference-contexts: This paper describes research based on characterizing case adaptation knowledge by decomposing it into two parts: (1) a small set of abstract structural transformations (e.g., <ref> [5, 9] </ref>), and (2) memory search strategies for finding the information needed to apply those transformations. <p> Both these approaches exhibit the classic operationality/generality tradeoff from explanation-based learning (e.g., [28]).

Specific rules, on the other hand, are easy to apply but have limited generality. In addition, defining such rules is difficult because of the specific knowledge that they require. Kass [11] proposes one way to address the operationality/generality tradeoff.

Reference-contexts: However, as will be discussed in a later section, we have also begun to investigate how this view of adaptation can be used to facilitate interactive acquisition of adaptation knowledge. DIAL's memory search mechanism uses a reactive planning framework, inspired by the RAPS system <ref> [7] </ref>, to interleave planning with execution and respond to problems during memory search (e.g., that needed intermediate information cannot be found). In this process, DIAL's rule-based adapter accepts a knowledge goal and chooses a strategy or stored memory search case indexed by the knowledge goal.

Reference-contexts: We begin by discussing the significance of the case adaptation problem for CBR and the tenets of our approach. We then summarize an initial implementation that applies our approach to learning case adaptation for case-based planning (e.g., <ref> [8] </ref>) in the disaster response planning domain. We close by highlighting lessons learned and related research on case adaptation and memory search. 2 Acquiring Case Adaptation Knowledge Coding effective adaptation rules can require extensive knowledge of the CBR system's task, its domain, and the contents of its memory. <p> The first is with abstract rules, such as the rule add a step to remove harmful side effect for case-based planning <ref> [8] </ref>. Such rules are applicable to a broad class of plan adaptation problems, but give no guidance about how to find the specific knowledge needed to apply them (e.g., to find the right step to add in order to mitigate a given side-effect). <p> The case-based planning framework is based in a straightforward way on previous case-based planners (e.g., CHEF <ref> [8] </ref>). Consequently, this paper will only discuss the adaptation component. 2 For Disaster response with Introspective Adaptation Learning. DIAL's adaptation component receives two inputs: an instantiated disaster response plan and a description of a problem in the response plan requiring adaptation. <p> Case adaptation: Some previous systems are able to learn knowledge useful for guiding adaptation. For example, although CHEF <ref> [8] </ref> has a static library of domain-independent plan repair strategies, it augments that library with learned ingredient critics that suggest adaptations appropriate to particular ingredients. Likewise, PERSUADER [29] uses a combination of heuristics and case-based reasoning to guide adaptation, searching memory for similar prior adaptations to apply.

Reference-contexts: This paper describes research based on characterizing case adaptation knowledge by decomposing it into two parts: (1) a small set of abstract structural transformations (e.g., <ref> [5, 9] </ref>), and (2) memory search strategies for finding the information needed to apply those transformations.

Reference-contexts: The memory search process: During DIAL's initial rule-based adaptation process, it finds the information needed to apply adaptation transformations by an introspective reasoning process that implements memory search as a form of planning, using operators that describe actions within its internal, or "mental" world, rather than within the external world <ref> [10] </ref>. Using a planning process facilitates flexible re-combination of memory search knowledge. By decoupling memory search knowledge from specific adaptation rules, memory search knowledge can be applied to any problem for which it appears relevant. Two types of memory search knowledge are provided to the system.

Reference-contexts: For EBG to apply successfully to memory search rules, those memory search rules must provide a complete and correct theory of the contents and organization of memory. Unfortunately, the contents and organization of a specific memory are highly idiosyncratic <ref> [13, 27] </ref> and thus hard to characterize precisely. Consequently, a chain of memory search rules that finds desired information in one instance is not guaranteed to ap-ply to other problems that appear to be within the scope of those same rules: explanation-based generalization may not yield reliable results. <p> By decoupling memory search knowledge from specific adaptation rules, memory search knowledge can be applied to any problem for which it appears relevant. Two types of memory search knowledge are provided to the system. First, the system is provided with knowledge goal transformation rules, similar to Kolod-ner's <ref> [13] </ref> query transformation rules, that reformulate the questions posed to memory. For example, one strategy for retrieving an instance of an event is to search for contexts in which it would have been likely to play a role. <p> Our research follows an alternative course, developing explicit models of the memory search process to increase the flexibility and effectiveness of memory search, in the spirit of <ref> [13, 25] </ref>, and to make it accessible to learning, as in [6, 12].

Reference-contexts: The problem is so acute that the most effective current strategy for building CBR applications is to bypass adaptation entirely, building advisory systems that provide cases to human users who perform the adaptation themselves (e.g., <ref> [2, 14] </ref>). However, despite the practical benefits of retrieval-only advisory systems, successful use of advisory systems may require considerable user expertise. Consequently, automatic case adaptation is important from a practical perspective, not only to enable CBR systems to perform autonomously but to enable them to aid naive users.

In this comparison, the knowledge planning method resulted in an order of magnitude savings in the number of primitive memory operations performed. This improvement is encouraging, although at this point it cannot be taken too seriously because of the limited set of examples used.

Reference-contexts: DIAL's evaluator determines that the notification step does not apply to the current situation, because of a conflict with normative type restrictions on union members: elementary school students do not belong to unions. (The evaluation and problem characterization process is similar to that described in Leake <ref> [16] </ref>). Consequently, the response plan must be adapted to apply to the students.

Reference-contexts: This framework forms the basis of an approach to adaptation in which new adaptation problems are solved by first selecting a transformation indexed under the type of problem motivating adaptation, and then performing introspective reasoning about how to strategically search memory for the information needed to apply the transformation <ref> [17] </ref>. Not only does this approach provide increased flexibility in finding needed information, but it serves as a foundation for learning to improve adaptation performance from experience: A trace of this process can be stored as an adaptation case and used in future case-based reasoning about the adaptation process itself. <p> In many of those contexts, the knowledge acquisition problem has been significantly ameliorated by the use of case-based reasoning.

The knowledge goal is then passed to a planning component that uses introspective reasoning about alternative memory search strategies <ref> [17, 20] </ref> to find the information needed. This search process generates a memory search plan whose operators include both an initial set of memory search strategies and memory search cases stored after solving previous adaptation problems. 3.

Reference-contexts: Likewise, not enough examples are yet implemented to have reliable data on the tradeoffs between memory search by knowledge planning and CBR. We are now extending the system with the aim of performing additional tests. In particular, an important tradeoff to investigate is the utility problem <ref> [21] </ref> for learned adaptation knowledge: the danger that processing overhead due to the proliferation of adaptation cases and memory search cases will counterbalance the benefits of the additional guidance that they provide.

Reference-contexts: This process guides the search for information needed to perform the adaptation. 2.2 From Rule-Based Adaptation to CBR After an adaptation problem has been solved by reasoning from scratch, a natural question is how to learn from that reasoning. Initially, it appears that explanation-based generalization (EBG) (e.g., <ref> [22] </ref>). would be the appropriate learning method, because it allows forming operational new generalizations: The memory search plan that found the needed information could be generalized and stored. However, one of the conclusions of our research is that using EBG to learn memory search rules is not practical [17].

Reference-contexts: Given the transformation, the program generates a knowledge goal <ref> [23] </ref> for the information needed to apply the transformation. E.g., for substitutions of role-fillers, the knowledge goal is to find an object that satisfies all the case's constraints on the object being replaced. <p> To do this reasoning, it must first have an explicit representation of the sought-after information.
