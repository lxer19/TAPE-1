Reference-contexts: It specifies the procedures and structures utilized for intersystem communication. The protocol targets "connection oriented, program-to-program communication utilizing telecommunication... It is assumed that the [client] initiates requests on behalf of the a user who wishes to to search a database located on a remote system." <ref> [Z39.50] </ref> The client computer capabilities include the submission of search requests, petitions for database record contents retrieval and responses to miscellaneous control requests by the data server. 2.2.1 A Session Maintaining State The Z39.50 protocol defines three phases during the life of the applications' intercon-nectivity: establishment, information transfer, and termination.

Reference-contexts: capable of combining information from disparate data sources. (In fact, a translation driver that interfaces to a WAIS system can be easily added to the Organization Engine system). 14 2.4 World Wide Web The World-Wide Web (W 3 ) initiative aims to construct a global information universe using available technology. <ref> [WWW] </ref> The project defines a scheme to integrate information from varying data sources. (see Figure 2.1) Similar to the Organization Engine, the model relies on the client-server model for information translation and transfer.

Reference-contexts: 2.2, the Wide Area Information Servers discussed in section 2.3, and finally the World Wide Web implementation that is discussed in section 2.4. 2.1 Semantic File System The Semantic File System (SFS) project of Gifford at MIT is a contemporary implementation that incorporates search facilities into an organization-based storage system <ref> [SFS] </ref>. It overlays a UNIX NFS file system with a search and indexing server to provide associative access to the system's contents. The system automatically extracts and indexes attributes from files with type specific transducers. <p> This replication technique is similar to the immediate duplication method discussed in section 6.1. It is also possible to maintain the query specifications, rather than the query results. "When a symbolic link names a virtual directory, the link describes a computed view of 10 a file system". <ref> [SFS, p.19] </ref> The notion of Query Links in this thesis bears a resemblance. Chapter 5 elaborates on the maintenance of query links in the Organization Engine.

Reference-contexts: For instance, the user can group such references into personally meaningful categories, or store them in desirable and easy to locate destinations for future access. In addition, the WAIS documentation does not fully discuss the significance of unique record identifiers. <ref> [KAHL90] </ref> Finally, the WAIS metaphor currently allows the client to access only WAIS servers. Therefore, the premise is that the data sources will conform to the WAIS client protocol specifications. This thesis takes a different approach to information retrieval from disparate data sources.

Reference-contexts: For example, in the current prototype development, translation drivers exist for a CODASYL-compliant hospital information system, a MUMPS-based radiology information system, and an SQL database. <ref> [OEVDI92] </ref>. 2.4.1 Hypertext Links and Search Capabilities The World-Wide Web project incorporates hypertext links and text search capabilities into its wide area networking capabilities. The user can store links to the result of performing a search. These searches are evaluated the next time the user follows the link. <p> (SDO) data model. 17 The goal [of the Organization Engine] is to provide a software base for use in exploring the issues that arise from dealing with vast quantities of data, primarily located in "legacy repositories" - pre-existing systems that merge raw data with structuring information in individual, idiosyncratic ways. <ref> [OEVDI92, p. 5] </ref> 3.1.1 Self-Describing Objects The data model chosen for the homogeneous representation is the Self-Describing Objects data model. It is similar to the Object Oriented data model in the sense that the database is composed of data entities, or objects. <p> As stated above, the User Interface communicates with the Tool Kit through an API using functions concerned with objects' fielded information. The Tool Kit's responsibility is to convert these operations into a "smaller set which communicates back to the actual source of data" <ref> [OEVDI92] </ref>. The Tool Kit maintains an internal object identifier for each SDO. This identifier is composed of two parts: an identification of its data source , and a unique identifier to be used by the data source.

Reference-contexts: In addition, one can retrieve or modify the component parts of this SDO." <ref> [OETR92, p. 4] </ref> Each SDO is composed of an ordered list of fields. Each field has three parts: Name A simple string used to distinguish and access the field. Each name must be unique within an object. Value This is an arbitrary value associated with a field name. <p> For other objects, the lower layer is always responsible for assigning the unique record identifier. <ref> [OETR92] </ref> In the query method, the user who creates the query link assigns the object identity through the selection of the remote database and the search string. 5.4.2 Editing Query Links Identifiers The process of query modification and refinement is facilitated by the query link identifier editing capability.

Reference-contexts: However, for fundamentally different data sources, such as an object-oriented data base versus a full-text information retrieval system, user level transparency to the search protocol is not advantageous. * A more intuitive user interface to the Organization Engine (for instance Maya 2000 Points Of Light <ref> [JSM92] </ref>) should be implemented. This enhancement should include a different metaphor for the incorporation of search abilities. [KSW92] * In order to exploit the benefits of the client application to the overall system, the implementation needs to provide the ability for data updates initiated by the client.

Reference-contexts: This section presents an overview of client interaction with the Library 2000 search engine and data server. The discussion is partially based on the help facilities of the system and partially on the weekly meetings held with Professor Saltzer. <ref> [REDRM] </ref> 3.2.1 Client Protocol The client protocol of the search engine is concerned with the formulation of queries over data collections and the retrieval of record contents. The protocol syntax is based on s-expressions. These allow a high degree of flexibility in specifying long and complex queries.

Reference-contexts: For instance, what are the implications if records are guaranteed only for a prespecified time? Here, the record identifier may need to include expiration information. <ref> [JHS92] </ref> * In order to enhance the Organization Engine, personalized views should be made accessible to other users upon demand. This requirement may include the transfer of record identifiers and query links to others. Ultimately, the Organization Engine could function as a value added index server.
