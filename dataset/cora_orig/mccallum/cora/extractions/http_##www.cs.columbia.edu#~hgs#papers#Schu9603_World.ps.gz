Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In a time span of about five years, the World-Wide Web (WWW) <ref> [1] </ref> has become, next to electronic mail, the most popular Internet application. It has been a major contributor in turning the Internet from an obscure data network for scientists and computer programmers to a household word.

Reference-contexts: There are other reasons for the rapid proliferation of WWW, making its rise, in hindsight, a bit less surprising than R. Lucky describes <ref> [2] </ref>: The technology works reasonably well for access speeds from 2400 baud modems on up since it retrievals can be restricted to text only, and newer Internet users, accustomed to graphical user interfaces, are far less tolerant of the command-based interfaces of traditional retrieval mechanisms like ftp or telnet.

Reference-contexts: The final section summarizes some of the new applications and alternatives for information delivery that might be viable in the near term. This article does not discuss the important topic of how to organize the resources that can be accessed via the world-wide web; Lynch <ref> [3] </ref> offers a survey of these more generic issues. 2 HTTP The native WWW protocol for data retrieval is the hypertext-transfer protocol, HTTP [4].

Reference-contexts: This article does not discuss the important topic of how to organize the resources that can be accessed via the world-wide web; Lynch [3] offers a survey of these more generic issues. 2 HTTP The native WWW protocol for data retrieval is the hypertext-transfer protocol, HTTP <ref> [4] </ref>. HTTP is an application level-protocol that currently is used probably exclusively with the Transmission Control Protocal (TCP), although there is no reason it could not be used with other reliable transport protocols.
Reference: [5] <author> R. Fielding, H. Frystyk, and T. Berners-Lee, </author> <title> Hypertext transfer protocol - http/1.1, Internet Draft, </title> <institution> Internet Engineering Task Force, </institution> <month> Nov. </month> <year> 1995. </year> <title> Work in progress. </title>
Reference-contexts: The client should then store these and return appro priate parameter-value pairs when accessing the given range of URLs. * HTTP could be extended to maintain a single TCP connection across several requests <ref> [5] </ref>. While this is desirable for performance reasons (see below), it does not work across several visits separated by a larger time span.

Reference-contexts: One of the greatest current problems with HTTP is its relative inefficiency. For a typical HTML page, the client first retrieves the HTML page itself, then discovers the potentially dozens of images contained within the page and issues a separate HTTP request for each. (Cunha et al. <ref> [6] </ref> have measured the average HTML page retrieved at 6.4 kBytes, with roughly 7 images per page.) Each HTTP retrieval requires at least one round trip time, plus the TCP connection setup of 3 one-way delays and a connection tear-down of another two round trips. <p> Caches may connect to other caches. The client connects to the cache and requests the document, which the cache server either has stored already or in turn retrieves from the actual server, keeping a copy to satisfy future queries. Caches can be quite effective <ref> [6] </ref>, but can also easily become bottlenecks and are then avoided by users. Also, many documents that look static are actually generated anew for each request and thus are not cacheable.

Reference-contexts: Since there is some overlap possible, the smallest retrieval time is 4 round trip delays. Thus, for typical long-distance round-trip times of around 300 ms, the minimum latency even with an infinitely fast link would be 1.2 seconds. In addition, the TCP congestion control mechanism <ref> [7] </ref> reduces the achievable throughput until the window has been fully opened, again without regard to the link speed.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the TCP congestion control mechanism [7] reduces the achievable throughput until the window has been fully opened, again without regard to the link speed. Experiments <ref> [8] </ref> show that using a TCP connection to transfer only 2 Kbytes for a link with 70 ms of round-trip delay results in a throughput less than 10% of the best-case value, increasing to only 50% with 20 kByte transfers. Typical browsers open several TCP connections at once.

Reference-contexts: For a busy server, this can add up to thousands of connection records. Some of the TCP-related latencies and the connection record problems can be reduced by a modified version of TCP, called transactional TCP (T/TCP) <ref> [9] </ref>. HTTP 1.1 suggests extensions that allow a single TCP connection to stay open for several HTTP transfers. This also allows servers to proactively transfer a HTML page, say, with all its icons, without the client explicitly asking for each.

Reference-contexts: not been implemented by any browser or server that the author is aware of. (For servers, it breaks the convenient notion of mapping URLs more-or-less one-to-one to file names.) For some media types, notably audio and video, additional parameters such as supported sampling rates or pixel depths would be desirable <ref> [10] </ref>, although it seems likely that most systems capable IEEE Network Magazine, March/April 1996 4 of displaying multimedia objects will soon have the maximum useful capability of 16-bit audio and 24-bit pixels. <p> There are some efforts to replace HTTP with a binary, ASN.1-based version that supports pipelining of several objects and asynchronous retrievals <ref> [10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: reach a large fraction of the throughput of a revised protocol and the textual parsing overhead is only relevant for the relatively small number of servers, displacement of HTTP by a different protocol does not seem imminent. 3 HTML HTML is a mixture of a presentational and descriptive markup system <ref> [11] </ref>. Presentational markup systems indicate how some text is to be rendered, e.g., in bold face of a certain font, with a given paragraph width. Descriptive markup tags the structure of a document, i.e., whether a certain piece of text is a heading, the abstract, a quotation, and the like.
Reference: [12] <author> L. Lamport, </author> <title> LaTeX: A Document Preparation System. </title> <address> Reading, Massachusetts: </address> <publisher> Addison-Wesley, </publisher> <year> 1986. </year>
Reference-contexts: Most of the web pages use the HTML descriptive elements to achieve layout and font effects. For example, the lower-ranked headings are used to produce small print. L A T E X <ref> [12] </ref> and some nroff macro sets also have both presentational and descriptive markup properties, but they differ from HTML in that they are programmable, i.e., contain the ability to write (small) programs, declare and invoke macros or functions, or conditionally execute certain parts of the description.

Reference-contexts: In fairness it should be noted that a generic, content-oriented encoding of even English text <ref> [13] </ref> is rather complicated. A particularly relevant omision, however, is document navigation.

Reference-contexts: Because of its non-procedural nature, HTML parsers can be rather forgiving of any HTML coding violations. A large fraction of web pages, even those professionally authored, contain coding mistakes, often used to achieve particular layout effects on popular browsers. Only since November 1995 has there been an IETF standard <ref> [14] </ref> for HTML. However, a large fraction of HTML pages use various supersets of this standard, e.g., to display tables, colored and textured page backgrounds or fonts of different sizes.

Reference-contexts: Within the Internet, HTML is already replacing a number of similar text systems, such as MIME rich text <ref> [15] </ref> or nroff manual pages. While there have been extensions of SGML to the presentation of continuous media (HyTime), they appear overly complex, yet still do not offer the full programming flexibility of a client-side programming and scripting language such as Safe-Tcl or Java.

Reference-contexts: The whole family is technically known as universal resource identifiers, of which URLs <ref> [16, 17] </ref> name the physical location of an object, URNs the identity without regard to location, and Uniform Resource Citations (URCs) describe properties of the object. Only URLs are in any widespread use.

Reference-contexts: A number of solutions can be envisioned. First, non-TCP protocols such as Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP) <ref> [18] </ref> that provide congestion feedback can be used to adaptively tune their buffering and encoding to the available bit rate. In addition, for both TCP and other protocols, resource reservation could guarantee a minimum bandwidth [19].

Reference-contexts: Web browsing is a solitary occupation. A visitor to a web page cannot see if there are other like-minded people reading the same page or interacting with the same 3D-world. There have been a number of proposals to create mutual awareness. The Virtual Places <ref> [21] </ref> protocol uses a separate server to track visitors, represented by small cartoons or pictures displayed on a custom browser. A visitor sees the movement of others on the page and can move her image to touch that of another visitor. As images touch, a packet voice connection is established.

Reference-contexts: However, all of these interactions only use the browser as a platform and bypass WWW protocols. Such web-based interactions might also be feasible by using scripting languages and multicast notifications of presence and location. This offers an enhanced version of the room metaphor employed in some video conferencing systems <ref> [22] </ref>. Chat rooms are quite popular on on-line services and there have been attempts to use WWW technology.

Reference-contexts: Efforts to develop micropayment schemes might provide a way to charge some small amount for each page retrieved, but nobody knows how users will react to hearing the meter ticking. The September Project <ref> [25] </ref> is investigating some of these issues in the context of scientific publications. On corporate intranets, Lotus Notes TM has been used for many of the same functions as the Web.

Reference-contexts: Thus, for publishing relatively static documents and simple scripts, WWW and Notes offer similar capabilities, while Notes seems to have a headstart IEEE Network Magazine, March/April 1996 12 on the backend, that is, server, side. Recently, Notes databases have become accessible from web browsers <ref> [26] </ref>. 9 Conclusion The success of the World Wide Web has, at least in the eyes of the non-technical public, made it and the Internet nearly synonymous. However, there are many interesting Internet-based services which are largely independent of the Web, and have quite different requirements.
