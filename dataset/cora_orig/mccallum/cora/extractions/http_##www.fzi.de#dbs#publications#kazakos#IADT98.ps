Abstract: The Catalogue of Data Sources (CDS) of the European Environment Agency is an environmental meta-information system to direct the user towards information about the state of the environment in Europe. The CDS comprises metadata (data about data sources of European interest), addresses, and a multilingual thesaurus. To provide global access to the CDS data via the Web, WebCDS has been developed. Major requirements were multilingual search and result forms, multilingual search by use of the multilingual thesaurus, independence of platforms, DBMS, and Web servers, user friendliness, easy extensibility. The Web application incorporates Java (on the server site), JDBC, RMI, servlets, and HTML. Servlets were utilized in order to overcome the problems of the classical HTML/CGI approach, e.g. servlets allow the communication of a client with an initialized service. We combined Java and HTML in WebCDS in order to gain nearly all advantages of Java without requiring Java capable Web browsers.

Reference-contexts: The CDS an environmental catalogue system to direct the user towards information about the state of the environment in Europe. It comprises metadata (data about data sources of European interest), addresses, and a multilingual thesaurus, the General European Multilingual Thesaurus GEMET <ref> [CNR, Rome, Umweltbundesamt, Berlin, 1997] </ref>. The CDS is designed for the collection, management, and dissemination of detailed descriptions of information resources. Currently for the collection and maintenance of metadata mainly a MS Windows based application (WinCDS) is used.

Reference-contexts: The information that is necessary to obtain above mentioned information is called meta-information. This information can be compared to the information of classical index cards in library catalogues, which describe books but are not the books themselves <ref> [Crossley, 1996] </ref>. Due to the present explosion of the volume of data, it becomes even more important for the user to rely on information about existing data in order to find what he or she needs.

Reference-contexts: A multilingual thesaurus is a regular thesaurus, with an equivalent term for every descriptor (possibly for non-descriptors as well) in each of the languages covered <ref> [DIN 1463, Teil 2, 1993] </ref>. The advantage of multilingual thesauri is that users do not have to be familiar with a particular language. They can use several languages for the retrieval from an information system, even though terms of just one language were used for indexing.

Reference-contexts: Information about descriptors, e.g., an explanation of the meaning of a term, can be stored in scope notes. The terms in a thesaurus are related to each other through diverse relationships <ref> [DIN 1463/1987, 1987] </ref> such as hierarchical relationship, equivalence relationship, and associative relationship.

Reference-contexts: The main base on which the design relies are so-called design patterns, elements of reusable object-oriented software as described in <ref> [Gamma et al., 1995] </ref>. <p> architect Christopher Alexander: "Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice" <ref> [Gamma et al., 1995] </ref>. To make the reuse of design information possible, design patterns are described in a consistent format. This way software designers can easier use and re-use this patterns for the particular application. <p> The major part of the database access subsystem takes the subsystem for the generation of the SQL statements. Every type of a query is build in its own class via a createStatement ()-method. This corresponds to the strategy pattern as introduced in <ref> [Gamma et al., 1995] </ref>. To avoid the problems of incompatible SQL dialects of different underlying DBMS, we introduced a kind of strategy factory. On initialization time of the catalogue system, the server decides which set of strategies to use and creates the corresponding strategy objects.
