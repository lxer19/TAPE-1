Abstract: We define fitness structure in genetic programming to be the mapping between the subprograms of a program and their respective fitness values. This paper shows how various fitness structures of a problem with independent subsolutions relate to the acquisition of sub-solutions. The rate of subsolution acquisition is found to be directly correlated with fitness structure whether that structure is uniform, linear or exponential. An understanding of fitness structure provides partial insight into the complicated relationship between fitness function and the outcome of genetic programming's search.

Reference-contexts: In Section 3 it was argued that two opaque relationships: test case value and credit apportionment, cloud the fitness function's relationship to GP outcome. Three such examples of research into credit apportionment are (Teller and Veloso 1996), (Rosca and Ballard 1994), and <ref> (Iba and de Garis 1996) </ref>. Teller and Veloso designed a neural programming system which has an explicit internal reinforcement policy to determine credit apportionment. Rosca's system extended GP by evolving modules that were integrated into the primitive set. It selected potential modules for encapsulation with knowledge rather than blindly.

Reference-contexts: One approach to understanding the relationship involves isolating its different parts and analyzing them independently. In this vein, this paper shows how fitness structure, the mapping between the subprograms of a program and their respective fitness values, relates to the acquisition of subsolutions in a standard version of GP <ref> (Koza 1992) </ref>. This mapping reveals how the search of GP depends on the apportionment of fitness over the parts of a program. This paper details experiments conducted with a problem called ORDER. In ORDER subprograms of a program are independent of each other in terms of their behaviour.
