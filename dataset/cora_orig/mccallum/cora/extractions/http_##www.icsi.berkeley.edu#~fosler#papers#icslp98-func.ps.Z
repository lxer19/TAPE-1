Abstract: The causes of pronunciation reduction in 8458 occurrences of ten frequent English function words in a four-hour sample from conversations from the Switchboard corpus were examined. Using ordinary linear and logistic regression models, we examined the length of the words, the form of their vowel (basic, full, or reduced), and final obstruent deletion. For all of these we found strong, independent effects of speaking rate, predictability, the form of the following word, and planning problem disfluencies. The results bear on issues in speech recognition, models of speech production, and conversational analysis.

Reference-contexts: The hybrid nature of our pseudo-utterances may be one reason for this; it may also be necessary to control for additional factors such as turn length, structure, and function. The prosodic context provided by the following word can also be expected to influence reduction variables <ref> (e.g. the lengthening rule proposed by Bolinger 1986) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Integrating the effects of rate, style, segmental context, and prosodic context on the durations and forms of the word, is also readily compatible with the models and concepts of gestural phonology <ref> (Browman and Goldstein 1992) </ref>. Another important factor that we hope to address in future work is part of speech; for example reduction is more common in the complementizer that than the pronoun that, etc.

Reference-contexts: We are also examining more sophisticated measures (non-retrospective predictability, change in pronunciation of word through a conversation) to investigate the difference between speaker-centered explanations for the predictability effect <ref> (Bybee 1996) </ref> and a hearer-centered explanations (Fowler and Housum 1987). Our results also have important implications for automatic speech recognition. While C-onset versus V-onset effects can be captured to some extent by current triphone pronunciation models, the other factors studied here are not.

Reference-contexts: This suggests that the partitive construction may be stored or unitized as a mental routine. 8. ADDITIONAL EFFECTS Following suggestions from research on repair <ref> (Fox and Jasperson 1995, inter alia) </ref> that planning problems may tend to be located early in turns, we examined the effect of word position on reduction and on the likelihood of disfluencies. No effect was found for either.

Reference-contexts: Preliminary remarks on the effects of other factors such as position in utterance, following syllable, and collocational effects are included; other potentially important factors such as syntactic function and dialect are not addressed. 2. METHODOLOGY The Switchboard corpus of telephone conversations between strangers was collected in the early 1990's <ref> (Godfrey et al. 1992) </ref>. The corpus contains 2430 conversations averaging 6 minutes each, totaling 240 hours of speech and 3 million words. Approximately four hours of this speech was phonetically hand-transcribed by Greenberg et al. (1996).

Reference-contexts: This may result in an allophonic effect such as the widely studied loss of final t and d (Neu 1980, inter alia). Alternatively, it may be an allomorphic one, as in the case of the with [Di] before vowels alternating with [D@] before consonants <ref> (Keating et al. 1994) </ref>. Indeed, we found significantly less reduction in all four variables when the next word began with a vowel than when it began with a consonant. Table 3 shows the effects for individual words.

Reference-contexts: FOLLOWING CONSONANT/VOWEL A general fact about weakening processes is that the form of a word is influenced by the segmental context in particular, more reduced forms tend to occur before a consonant than before a vowel <ref> (Rhodes 1996, inter alia) </ref>. This may result in an allophonic effect such as the widely studied loss of final t and d (Neu 1980, inter alia).
