Title: Communication and Contention: "Now you see it now you don't"  
Author: Richard J. Enbody Tim Harrison Peter Nesbeitt Rob Seward 
Keyword: Key words: performance measurement, communication performance, wormhole routing, contention, MIMD, mesh. Symult, Delta, Paragon, OSF, SUNMOS.  
Abstract: In message-passing parallel processors contention for physical channels can affect communication performance, and hence overall performance. In this paper, we examine contention on three generations of wormhole-routed, mesh architectures: Symult 2010, Intel Touchstone Delta, and Intel Paragon. Our work also spans four generations of operating systems: Cosmic (CE/RK) on the Symult, NX/M on the Delta, and both OSF and SUNMOS on the Paragon. Contention is present on the Symult and Delta. It disappears on the Paragon while running OSF (R 1.1.6), but reappears with the faster communication offered by SUNMOS. The characteristics of contention are examined in detail on the Delta. We also find that the wasted bandwidth on the OSF Paragon has benefits. A side effect of this work indicates that path contention level, a metric of contention, accurately reflects the communication characteristics observed in applications run in the presence of contention.

Reference-contexts: First-generation, message-passing parallel processors used store-and-forward routing whose performance was a function of the length of the path that the message traveled. Wormhole routing promises communication performance which is independent of the message's path length <ref> [1] </ref>. Reducing the effect of path length allows contention for communication channels to dominate communication degradation. One purpose of this report is to examine whether such degradation can be significant. As communication network technology advances, interprocessor communication performance is steadily increasing.

Reference-contexts: Chittor's metric, path contention level, is described later. A very readable summary of wormhole-routing issues appeared in the February, 1993 IEEE Computer magazine <ref> [2] </ref>. The Intel DELTA represents the second generation of wormhole-routed meshes. Experiments conducted on the Intel DELTA, indicate that, even in as efficient a communication network as that utilized by the DELTA, contention still can have a significant affect on communication performance, and hence on overall application performance.

Reference-contexts: No problem with contention means that the mapping of an application to processors can be completely arbitrary, and not necessarily contiguous. However, closer examination indicates a dark side. Experiments run at Parajjab indicate that less than 7% of the 200 MBytes/sec available bandwidth can be achieved on this machine <ref> [4] </ref>. The reason is that the processors cannot generate messages fast enough. The maximum path contention level achievable on this 7fi14 machine is 7 using a 1fi14 column. <p> Also, SUNMOS can use the second i860 processor (message processor) which is available on each node. That message processor was not available on R 1.1.x of OSF. Measurements at Parajjab indicate that SUNMOS works as promised to provide much more of the 200 MBytes/sec communication capacity of the Paragon <ref> [4] </ref>. With any processor now able to consume 70% (140/200) of the communication capacity of a link, contention should be visible. Unfortunately for this study, only a 4fi4 partition of the Paragon at Parajjab is running SUNMOS.

Reference-contexts: In addition, an analysis of path contention combined with knowledge about message lengths can indicate that any mapping is acceptable for a particular application. Contention for communication channels on wormhole-routed meshes has been studied by Dally [8] and Chittor & Enbody <ref> [5, 6, 7] </ref>. Dally showed that contention could increase communication time dramatically. We demonstrated contention to be visible on a first-generation, wormhole-routed mesh|the Symult 2010. <p> When contention is present, a plot of communication time across the nodes should be a "V" shape. 4 Symult 2010 This section shows that contention existed on the first generation of commercial, wormhole-routed, mesh machines (as we first reported in <ref> [5] </ref>). We first must show that path length is not a significant factor, and then introduce contention and show that it causes noticeable delay.

Reference-contexts: Interprocessor communication performance, in turn, depends in part on the contention of messages for physical communication channels. The degree to which contention affects communication time is affected by the communication characteristics of an application and the level of contention for network resources <ref> [7] </ref>. First-generation, message-passing parallel processors used store-and-forward routing whose performance was a function of the length of the path that the message traveled. Wormhole routing promises communication performance which is independent of the message's path length [1]. <p> In addition, an analysis of path contention combined with knowledge about message lengths can indicate that any mapping is acceptable for a particular application. Contention for communication channels on wormhole-routed meshes has been studied by Dally [8] and Chittor & Enbody <ref> [5, 6, 7] </ref>. Dally showed that contention could increase communication time dramatically. We demonstrated contention to be visible on a first-generation, wormhole-routed mesh|the Symult 2010. <p> The second is an examination of the characteristics of contention when it is present. The third is further confirmation that the path contention metric of <ref> [7] </ref> can indicate performance degradation due to contention. However, this paper also indicates circumstances where contention does not matter even on machines with observable contention. Finally, we show that wormhole routing's promise of distance-independent routing holds even on a large machine (when there is no contention). <p> These runs both set a baseline for this communication pattern and also indicate that longer paths do not result in longer communication times. 3 Path Contention Metric Chittor <ref> [7] </ref> proposed path contention level as a simple first-order predictor of contention. The path contention level is the number of other paths that a message path contends with. For example, in Figure 2 the path contention level of the outermost nodes is 2; in more by contention than Figure 2. <p> While path contention level and path length are not independent, it is clear that contention is the problem on these machines and that the path contention level of <ref> [7] </ref> is a first-order predictor. The implication is that the mapping of a problem onto this type of multiprocessor should be a concern in programming. As noted in [7], contention and non-uniformities in traffic scale with the number of nodes if a random mapping is used, and an increase in contention <p> length are not independent, it is clear that contention is the problem on these machines and that the path contention level of <ref> [7] </ref> is a first-order predictor. The implication is that the mapping of a problem onto this type of multiprocessor should be a concern in programming. As noted in [7], contention and non-uniformities in traffic scale with the number of nodes if a random mapping is used, and an increase in contention together with non-uniform traffic can significantly degrade the communication performance. On the other hand, the importance of mapping can be overemphasized.
