Title: On the Natural Growth of Random Forests

Abstract: We explore several aspects of the natural growth of random forests. We show that if initially there are k single-node forests and N nodes to add to the forest, and every forest node is equally likely to be connected to the next node added, then the tree that receives the last node will have an expected 2N=k nodes. We next explore the growth of a minimum weight forest. We show that the probability that a node in the forest is connected to the next node added to the forest depends primarily upon how recently the forest node was added to the forest, and that this distribution approaches a limit distribution. We obtain the surprising result that when a node is added to the forest, it is adjacent to the most recently added node 50% of the time.

Reference-contexts: We show that the uniform growth model is a poor approximation, however, because the uniform growth model predicts short, bushy trees, while the minimum weight model predicts long, thin trees. Previous work in characterizing the growth of forests has concentrated on forests in random graphs (see <ref> [1] </ref> for a survey), or on the natural growth of search trees (see [8] for a survey). The question of the weight of the minimum spanning tree of a randomly weighted graph has been addressed by Frieze [3] and Steele [12]. <p> The algorithm marks the first unmarked box that is found. If box 1 is marked, the algorithm concludes that edge e j adds node k + i. procedure markbox (L i ) initialize box [1..i] as unmarked. j=1. while box <ref> [1] </ref> is unmarked get e j . if s&gt;i then s=i. while box [s] is marked s=s-1. mark box [s]. j=j+1. return (j-1). Executions of retrace and markbox procedures are illustrated in Table 1. The sorted list of edges L is the same as that in Figure 6.

Reference-contexts: At each step, we add a new node to the forest by finding the lowest weight edge that connects a node in the forest to a node not in the forest, then adding the edge and the attached node (i.e, apply Dijkstra's algorithm <ref> [9] </ref>). We assume that all edge weights are independently and identically chosen from a continuous distribution over the real numbers, F (x).
