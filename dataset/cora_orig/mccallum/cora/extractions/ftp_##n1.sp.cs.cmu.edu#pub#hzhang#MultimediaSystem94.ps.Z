Abstract: Most of the solutions proposed to support real-time (i.e. guaranteed performance) communication services in packet-switching networks adopt a connection-oriented and reservation-oriented approach. In such an approach, resource allocation and route selection decisions are made before the start of the communication on the basis of resource availability and real-time network load at that time, and are usually kept for the duration of the communication. This rather static resource management approach has certain limitations: it does not take into account (a) the dynamics of the communicating clients; (b) the dynamics of the network state; and (c) the tradeoff between quality of service and network availability, thus affecting the availability and flexibility of the real-time network services. Availability is the ability of the network to accommodate as many real-time clients as possible, while flexibility is the ability to adapt the real-time services to changing network state and client demands. In this paper, we present the Dynamic Connection Management (DCM) scheme, which addresses these issues by providing the network with the capability to dynamically modify the performance parameters and the routes of any existing real-time connection. With these capabilities, DCM can be used to increase the availability and flexibility of the guaranteed performance service offered to the clients.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction With the advent of high-speed networking, there is an increasing demand for new applications that transmit digital video and audio over packet-switched networks. These applications have stringent real-time performance requirements in terms of throughput, delay, delay jitter and loss rate <ref> [Fer90] </ref>, and cannot be supported by the best-effort communication services currently offered in data networks. To support these performance requirements, new solutions have been proposed that provide guaranteed performance or real-time services in packet-switched networks [FV90, Top90, Zha89, AHS90, CGG91, PT89, LP91, CSZ92].

Reference-contexts: As shown in <ref> [CSZ92, Fer92, ZK91, Zha93] </ref>, many service disciplines can be used to provide real-time service. However, different service disciplines require different admission control algorithms. For the purpose of this paper, we assume that the service discipline used at the switches is Rate-Controlled Static Priority [ZF93, Zha93] or RCSP. <p> The Tenet and DCM frameworks are capable of supporting heterogeneous network topologies comprised of both wired and wireless links <ref> [Fer92] </ref>. In this experiment a channel exists between host 0 and host m, where host m is the mobile host. Host m follows a path in a downward direction, and therefore connects to node 2, 3, and 10.

A real-time channel is a network connection associated with traffic and performance parameters.

Reference-contexts: As shown in <ref> [CSZ92, Fer92, ZK91, Zha93] </ref>, many service disciplines can be used to provide real-time service. However, different service disciplines require different admission control algorithms. For the purpose of this paper, we assume that the service discipline used at the switches is Rate-Controlled Static Priority [ZF93, Zha93] or RCSP. <p> switch does not have only an upper bound, but also a lower bound, and the difference between the two bounds, which 9 These deterministic services have a deterministic delay bound and a zero buffer overflow probability. is the delay jitter, can be tuned by properly setting the local delay bounds <ref> [ZF93, ZK91] </ref>.
