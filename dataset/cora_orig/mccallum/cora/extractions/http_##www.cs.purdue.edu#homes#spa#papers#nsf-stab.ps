Title: STABILITY CONSIDERATIONS FOR NETWORKS Project Summary  
Note: NSF GRANT NCR-9206315  
Abstract: The main objective for this research was to establish effective methods for the study of the asymptotic behavior and fundamental limits that occur in networking. In the research, we restrict our interest to stability problems in a multidimensional environment. The variability inherent in most distributed systems is such that to make meaningful performance predictions, it is necessary to study the evolution of a stochastic model. Such a stochastic approach was assumed throughout this project. Our past experiences led us to the conclusion that Markovian techniques applied to multidimensional stability provide only a partial solution. During the course of the research, we proposed several new approaches to the stability analysis of networking that are based on a non-Markovian philosophy. We demonstrated that such an approach can rigorously provide stability criteria for such open problems as stability of multiaccess systems (e.g., ALOHA system), token passing rings, rings with spatial reuse, and so forth.

(A2) The maximum time customers are served during the token visit at a queue is limited to t i &lt; 1 units of time. <p> To formulate them, we need some notation. Define e L i = minfk : P k j i t i g and ` i = E e L i . Clearly, ` i is the average of the maximum number of customers served during t i . In <ref> [3] </ref> we proved the following result: Theorem 1 Consider a token passing ring consisting of M stations with t -limited service schedule for the ith station, and Poisson arrivals. <p> More importantly, the proof offered in <ref> [3] </ref> can be applied virtually unchanged to the following class of monotonic and contractive policies. <p> Other special cases are the `-limited gated discipline and Bernoulli gated disciplines. In the last discipline, f i (n; X) = minfn; Xg, where X is a geometrically distributed random variable. The following result was established in <ref> [3] </ref>: Theorem 2 Consider a token passing ring that employs a monotonic and contractive service dis cipline described above.

(In fact, our technique usually does not establish stability of boundary points, however, in most cases only minor modifications are necessary to prove instability of boundary points; e.g., see Georgiadis and Szpankowski <ref> [3] </ref> and its references). 6 Theorem 4 The stability region of the buffered ALOHA system with slot availability 1 b is R M [b] = k=1 succ (M k ); and M k 2 R M k [1 (1 b)(1 r k )]g : In particular, the original ALOHA system is <p> This fact is easy to prove on a countable state space, and the reader is referred to <ref> [3, 18] </ref>.

It is easy to construct multidimensional systems where fluctuations of the queue lengths between large and small values occur when the system is unstable.
