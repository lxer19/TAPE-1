Reference-contexts: We conclude by raising some questions. 2 Terminology We start by fixing some terminology on graded modules and finite group representations. Some general references for the former are <ref> [1] </ref>, [8], and [12], and for the later [15] and [6]. Let K be a field. <p> Proof. First, note that for i = 1; ; m we have m X (1) l [1; ; mjj 0 ; ; ^ j l ; ; j m ]x i;j l = <ref> [i; 1; ; mjj 0 ; ; j m ] </ref> = 0; which shows that all elements of G are indeed syzygies on X. <p> &lt; k &lt; m then I k = k (M k ) = f0g, whereas if 2 k minfm; ng then I k = k (M k ) is the ideal of A generated by the set P k = k (G k ) = l=1 = f (1) k+1 <ref> [1; ; kjj 1 ; ; j k ] </ref> : 1 j 1 &lt; &lt; j k ng; which is, up to sign, the set of maximal minors of X [k] .

Reference-contexts: This set is known to form a Grobner basis for D k;n [13], and moreover, was recently shown to be a universal Grobner basis, i.e., a Grobner basis for D k;n with respect to any monomial order on A (k) [14], <ref> [2] </ref>. The Hilbert series H (D k;n ; t) is known as well [16]. We can now prove the following theorem. <p> Is the set of determinantal relations on a generic matrix a universal Grobner basis for the module of syzygies on its columns? If true, this may provide an alternative way of proving the remarkable universality of the ideal of maximal minors of a generic matrix [14], <ref> [2] </ref>. Returning to linear representations, we note that the Hilbert series and Betti numbers of a representation depend only on the set of pairs f (m 1 ; n 1 ); ; (m k ; n k )g of the multiplicities and dimensions of irreducible constituents of .

Reference-contexts: The basic components of this decomposition are certain generic modules, which arise in various contexts, e.g., [5], <ref> [3] </ref>. We are interested in the possibility of recovering numerical invariants of the representation themultiplicities and dimensions of its irreducible constituents from numerical invariants of the module M () its Hilbert series and Betti numbers. <p> In this section and the following one, we study generic modules, which arise in various contexts (cf. [5], <ref> [3] </ref>), from a Grobner bases theoretical perspective. In the present section we prove that, for any m and n, determinantal relations form a Grobner basis for the module of syzygies on a generic m fi n matrix, with respect to any lexicographic monomial order on A n .

Proposition 5.2 If : G ! GL (V ) is an irreducible representation of a finite group over an algebraically closed field then E () = L (V ) = 1 (V fl V ). <p> Now let : G ! GL (V ) be an arbitrary linear representation of a finite group G over an algebraically closed field K, the characteristic of which does not divide the group order. By a theorem of Maschke (see e.g. <ref> [6] </ref>), is completely reducible, i.e. has a decomposition = i=1 m i i where the i are pairwise nonisomorphic irreducible representations of G over K. Let n = dim () and n i = dim ( i ).
