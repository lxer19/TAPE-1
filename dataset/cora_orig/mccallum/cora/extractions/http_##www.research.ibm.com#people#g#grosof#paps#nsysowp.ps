Reference-contexts: The sympathetically solitary class appears useful for representing reasoning that is shallow in a particular sense. Its tractability (in the non-monotonic aspect) arises from the lack of conflict between multiple defaults, similarly to stratified logic programs with negation by failure <ref> [ Apt et al., 1987 ] </ref> [ Van Gelder, 1988 ] (there the minimization of each predicate or ground atom corresponds to a default).

Reference-contexts: However, sympathetically solitary overlaps with, and neither includes nor is included by, the following classes: logic programs with negation by failure; Horn; default inheritance cf. Touretzky [ 1986 ] ; predicate completion <ref> [ Clark, 1978 ] </ref> ; and the general Closed World Assumption. In the next 3 sections, we cover some preliminaries and give background. 2 Prioritized Default Circumscription: Definitions and Notation Circumscription in its predicate form was defined by John McCarthy [ 1980 ] [ 1986 ] . <p> Note that the prioritization R is irrelevant: essentially, because there is no conflict (see below). As Lifschitz noted (and as Reiter did, for a special case, before him), this case of circumscription thus bears a close relationship to the predicate completion of <ref> [ Clark, 1978 ] </ref> . Lifschitz' result generalizes a previous result by Reiter [ 1982 ] for the case of a single minimized predicate. The solitary case also has an interesting relationship to the Closed World Assumption (CWA) [ Reiter, 1978 ] . <p> This general-case intractability of clausal conversion is a well-known difficulty in monotonic theorem-proving. Having the generating axioms be in clausal form is quite helpful for performing monotonic inference using them. The same problem of clausal conversion arises even in predicate completion <ref> [ Clark, 1978 ] </ref> . In an important special case, however, the clausal conversion of the generating axioms can, indeed, be performed tractably. The following additional restrictions, taken together, suffice: no fixed predicates, domain closure, and uniqueness of names. These expressive restrictions are common in applications, in our experience.

Reference-contexts: reasoning is intrinsically intractable in the worst case, for a variety of the expressively richer (cases of) formalisms [ Reiter, 1980 ] [ Kolaitis and Papadimitriou, 1988 ] [ Selman and Kautz, 1989a ] [ Kautz and Sel-man, 1989 ] [ Stillman, 1990 ] [ Selman and Levesque, 1989 ] <ref> [ Eiter and Gottlob, 1991 ] </ref> [ Stillman, 1992 ] [ Gottlob, 1992 ] . <p> Levesque, 1989 ] <ref> [ Eiter and Gottlob, 1991 ] </ref> [ Stillman, 1992 ] [ Gottlob, 1992 ] . Especially interesting is the fact that skeptical entailment has been recently shown to be P 2 -complete for the propositional case of several expressively rich non-monotonic logics, including: predicate circumscription without priorities [ Eiter and Gottlob, 1991 ] , the "normal" case of Default Logic [ Stillman, 1992 ] [ Gottlob, 1992 ] , Autoepistemic Logic [ Gottlob, 1992 ] , and several other non-monotonic modal logics [ Gottlob, 1992 ] . 3 P 2 -complete is standard terminology in the area of <p> Delgrande [ 1991 ] gives a polynomial-time backward procedure for a Horn propositional case of his conditional logic. <ref> [ Eiter and Gottlob, 1991 ] </ref> and [ Gottlob, 1992 ] give and review some other cases of tractability.

Reference-contexts: The basic idea is to impose a solitary-like condition on each of the predicates that appear in the default formulas. For each predicate, the direction of this condition corresponds to the 5 Perhaps such a method can be developed, however, based on the approach of <ref> [ Gabbay and Ohlbach, 1992 ] </ref> . sign with which that predicate appears in the defaults, i.e., it is "sympathetic" towards the defaults' maximization. We require, moreover, that this sign be unique. Note that variable-solitary is the special case of sympathetic-solitary in which the default formulas are negated predicates.

Notation: Let G E stand for 8x: G (x) E (x), where G and E are open (first-order) formulas with the same arity (i.e., are similar), and x stands for a tuple of individual object variables. <p> B is called the base of the circumscription. D are called the defaults of the circumscription. R is called the prioritization (partial order) of the circumscription. F are called the fixtures of the circumscription. 2 Circumscriptive Language of Defaults (CLD): In [ Grosof and Russell, 1990 ] and <ref> [ Grosof, 1992 ] </ref> we developed a convenient meta-language for specifying PDC's: the Circum-scriptive Language of Defaults (CLD). In CLD, there are four kinds of axioms, i.e., premises. A *&gt; prefix indicates that the sentence that follows is a base axiom, i.e., has for-sure (non-defeasible) belief status. <p> Let W Z be a tuple of predicate and/or function symbols. As shorthand for fixing symbols, we simply write P DC (B; D; R; f ix W ; Z) to indicate the fixing of W . In <ref> [ Grosof, 1992 ] </ref> (Theorem 2.24 there), we show that domain closure plus a complete theory of equality about the ground terms, e.g., uniqueness of names, implies that all functions are effectively fixed. <p> By "effectively", we mean that fixing the functions does not affect the circumscription, in the sense of equivalence. See [ Grosof, 1991 ] and <ref> [ Grosof, 1992 ] </ref> for more discussion of how prioritized circumscriptions are defined. Note that the prioritization partial order R is not necessarily layered (stratified) as it was in [ Lifschitz, 1985a ] . <p> Why Employ PDC and CLD: We employ PDC and CLD to clarify the definitions of axiom sets and of updating, and the intuitive relationship to other formalisms for default reasoning. Abnormality-Style PPC: <ref> [ Grosof, 1992 ] </ref> (section 3.3) shows the essential equivalence of any prioritized default circumscription to a corresponding, "abnormality-style", prioritized predicate circumscription, generalizing a previous result (for the case without prioritization) that appeared in [ Lifschitz, 1984 ] . Next, we repeat that result. <p> and selectiveness can be defined for many other NM formalisms, including the skeptical versions of Default Logic and Autoepistemic Logic. 4 Relationships of PDC to Other Non-Monotonic For malisms There are many known relationships between prioritized default circumscription and many other non-monotonic logical formalisms: see, for example, the review in <ref> [ Grosof, 1992 ] </ref> . For example, in [ Grosof, 1992 ] (section 8.5), we give the following slight generalization of Etherington's [ Etherington, 1988 ] Theorem 8.3 (which is for the predicate case). <p> NM formalisms, including the skeptical versions of Default Logic and Autoepistemic Logic. 4 Relationships of PDC to Other Non-Monotonic For malisms There are many known relationships between prioritized default circumscription and many other non-monotonic logical formalisms: see, for example, the review in <ref> [ Grosof, 1992 ] </ref> .

The argument involves substitution (of G for Q) in the circumscription formula, properties of positivity / negativity, and lemmas about prioritization. See <ref> [ Grosof, 1992 ] </ref> for the full details of the proof. 2 Intuition: Predicates Q Pull Together Towards Bounds: Theorem 12 tells one that, in the sympathetically solitary case, the variable predicates Q mentioned in the defaults all pull (i.e., rise modulo their appearing sign ) towards their (upper) bounds G. <p> This selectiveness can be at a variety of grain sizes: by individual default instances, by individual open defaults, or by sets of defaults. This can save computational effort. 8 Discussion Additional Results: In <ref> [ Grosof, 1992 ] </ref> , we discuss how the explicit solution can be viewed at a finer grain-size: in terms of individual default instances. By a "default instance", we mean a ground instantiation of a default formula.

Reference-contexts: Fixing: "Fixing" is an expressively important technical aspect in the definition and application of various historical variants of circumscription, e.g., in [ McCarthy, 1986 ] <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1985a ] </ref> . Most use of fixing has been to fix predicate and/or function symbols; our definition of PDC above is a bit more general in that it permits the fixing of any first-order formula. In this paper, we mainly do not use this generality, however. <p> See [ Grosof, 1991 ] and [ Grosof, 1992 ] for more discussion of how prioritized circumscriptions are defined. Note that the prioritization partial order R is not necessarily layered (stratified) as it was in <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1985a ] </ref> . Predicate Circumscription: Prioritized predicate circumscription is the special case of prioritized default circumscription in which each default formula Di takes the form of a negative open literal :P i (x), corresponding to the minimization of a predicate (symbol) P i.

Reference-contexts: Yet they are not covered: whether in adaptive or definitional form, the abnormality predicates appear positively in the base in mixture with the auxiliary predicates. Stratified logic programs with negation are another important case of prioritized predicate circumscription <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1987 ] </ref> . Like the solitary case, they are conflict-free. However, in stratified logic programs with negation, there are (typically) no fixed predicates. Thus the only time they are solitary is when all clauses have empty tails.

Fixing: "Fixing" is an expressively important technical aspect in the definition and application of various historical variants of circumscription, e.g., in <ref> [ McCarthy, 1986 ] </ref> [ Lifschitz, 1985a ] . Most use of fixing has been to fix predicate and/or function symbols; our definition of PDC above is a bit more general in that it permits the fixing of any first-order formula.

Reference-contexts: We develop the definition and results about the sympathetically solitary class in terms of circumscription; however, they also apply straightforwardly to Default Logic [ Reiter, 1980 ] , Autoepistemic Logic <ref> [ Moore, 1985 ] </ref> , and several other non-monotonic formalisms as well. The sympathetically solitary class generalizes Lifschitz' [ 1985a ] solitary class.

Reference-contexts: The sympathetically solitary class generalizes Lifschitz' [ 1985a ] solitary class. It also includes, as a special case, the simple application of the Closed World Assumption <ref> [ Reiter, 1978 ] </ref> to unit-clausal databases, when there is domain closure and a complete theory of equality, e.g., uniqueness of names. However, sympathetically solitary overlaps with, and neither includes nor is included by, the following classes: logic programs with negation by failure; Horn; default inheritance cf. <p> Lifschitz' result generalizes a previous result by Reiter [ 1982 ] for the case of a single minimized predicate. The solitary case also has an interesting relationship to the Closed World Assumption (CWA) <ref> [ Reiter, 1978 ] </ref> . A simple, basic case of the CWA is when all clauses are unit, and both domain closure and uniqueness of names are present.

Reference-contexts: worst case, for a variety of the expressively richer (cases of) formalisms [ Reiter, 1980 ] [ Kolaitis and Papadimitriou, 1988 ] [ Selman and Kautz, 1989a ] [ Kautz and Sel-man, 1989 ] [ Stillman, 1990 ] [ Selman and Levesque, 1989 ] [ Eiter and Gottlob, 1991 ] <ref> [ Stillman, 1992 ] </ref> [ Gottlob, 1992 ] . <p> Especially interesting is the fact that skeptical entailment has been recently shown to be P 2 -complete for the propositional case of several expressively rich non-monotonic logics, including: predicate circumscription without priorities [ Eiter and Gottlob, 1991 ] , the "normal" case of Default Logic <ref> [ Stillman, 1992 ] </ref> [ Gottlob, 1992 ] , Autoepistemic Logic [ Gottlob, 1992 ] , and several other non-monotonic modal logics [ Gottlob, 1992 ] . 3 P 2 -complete is standard terminology in the area of computational complexity theory ( [ Garey and Johnson, 1979 ] , section 7.2).

Reference-contexts: Example 15, below, illustrates. There is some more good news, though. With more fixtures, the picture is a bit brighter: chaining can take place through any literal whose predicate is fixed, even if that predicate or literal appears in a default rule. Compared to default inheritance, e.g., cf. <ref> [ Touretzky, 1986 ] </ref> , the sympathetic-solitary class is more expressive in several respects. A default or base rule may have several antecedents; i.e., as a clause it need not be binary. And the rule need not be Horn: negation may appear freely.

Reference-contexts: The sympathetically solitary class appears useful for representing reasoning that is shallow in a particular sense. Its tractability (in the non-monotonic aspect) arises from the lack of conflict between multiple defaults, similarly to stratified logic programs with negation by failure [ Apt et al., 1987 ] <ref> [ Van Gelder, 1988 ] </ref> (there the minimization of each predicate or ground atom corresponds to a default).
