Abstract: We present a computationally efficient method for deriving the most appropriate transformation and mapping of a nested loop for a given hierarchical parallel machine. This method is in the context of our systematic and general theory of unimodular loop transformations for the problem of iteration space partitioning [7]. Finding an optimal mapping or an optimal associated unimodular transformation is NP-complete. We present a polynomial time method for obtaining a `good' transformation using a simple parameterized model of the hierarchical machine. We outline a systematic methodology for obtaining the most appropriate mapping.

Reference-contexts: End of Algorithm A1 It is easy to show <ref> [1] </ref> that these operations preserve unimodularity of U . In general, algorithm A1 has O (N 2 ) or O (r 2 ) (whichever is smaller) basic steps as its complexity upper bound, where N a basic step corresponds to the elimination operation.

Reference-contexts: Most existing approaches treat transformations like loop interchange (permutation), outer and inner loop parallelization, reversal etc. independently. Only recently have there been attempts <ref> [2, 4, 5, 10] </ref> to treat the transformations in the unified framework of unimodular matrix transformations. A even more general and comprehensive theory has been presented in our recent work [7]. <p> This is however not very practical since the number of parallel iterations involved is then a product of all the loop bounds and is hence too large for a closely coupled machine. 2.1 Unimodular Transformations for N <p>- D Iteration Spaces The concept of unimodular transformations, introduced by Banerjee <ref> [2] </ref> and by Wolf and Lam in [10], is a uni form and general framework for viewing Lamport's gen-eral hyperplane method [8], loop reversal, loop skewing and loop permutaions.
