Abstract: This paper presents a parallel algorithm to solve the eigenvalue problem for nonsymmetric matrices. The idea of homotopy is used to generate initial approximations, then the Aberth method and our modified Aberth method are used to find simultaneously all the eigenvalues. The advantage of this approach is that multiple eigenvalues can be handled. In addition, the multiplicities of the eigenvalues can be detected dy namically. In this paper we consider the problem of finding all the eigenvalues of a nonsymmetric matrix. Without loss of generality we assume that the matrix is irreducible upper Hessenberg matrix, The solutions of H(; t) = 0, 1 (t); 2 (t); :::; n (t), are smooth functions of t which connect the eigenvalues of D and A. They do not meet in the t interval (0; 1) with probability one. The Aberth method and our modified Aberth method are then applied to follow these curves simultaneously. The Aberth method [1] is an efficient iterative method of finding simultaneously all the roots of polynomials with simple roots. We modified this method to find all the roots of ANY polynomial without sacrificing efficiency. Both methods converge cubically. A distinguished property both of the original and of these methods is that they are globally convergent for almost all initial approximations.
