Abstract: Creating practical design support systems is a complex design endeavor. We approach it with an evolutionary process, one that studies the design information flow then builds and tests information management support systems. Through our experience with industrial partners we have evolved this process into a set of methods and tools that support these methods. We have evolved an infrastructure called n-dim, that is composed of a small number of building blocks that can be composed in ways that match the complexity of design contexts and work. We have developed this infrastructure to be highly flexible so as to allow us to conduct this evolutionary process in a practical project setting.

Reference-contexts: Thus far, we have been able to represent all types of information and knowledge using this canonical representation. Hence, while on the surface our iterative approach is not fundamentally different from other approaches in software engineering <ref> (Boehm, 1988) </ref>, the guiding principles, the architecture, the tools and methods, are all internally consistent and designed to support the rapid development of a series of increasingly rich support systems which can then be followed by a hardening phase for final deployment.

Reference-contexts: They range from comprehensive product development studies (Clark and Fujimoto, 1991; Hales, 1987) to studies of individual designers <ref> (Bucciarelli, 1984) </ref>. These studies provide a tapestry of design covering the organization of design, the evaluation of normative methods in design, group work around a table, information flow analysis, process-based analysis, and task-related analysis for cooperating groups. <p> on outcome. 3 Copyright 1997 by ASME Design is a social and linguistic process requiring the partic ipants to actively negotiate and translate information from one object world into other object worlds each being a composite based on the training, background, experiences (general and specific), etc. of each individual participant <ref> (Bucciarelli, 1984) </ref>. There are difficulties in synthesizing and organizing diverse information into a coherent view. Due to the lack of adequate information integration, design ers often evaluate only a single alternative. The organizational structure of the design team and the in stitution constrains information integration.

Reference-contexts: The n-dim system itself is an infrastructure that is customized to particular applications and within which new applications can be built. For example, we have developed several types of issue-based discussion applications and tested them <ref> (e.g., IWEB, Coyne et al., 1994) </ref>. n-dim is not a system that can just be bought and installed. This can be viewed as a weakness from a commercial point of view and we are keeping that much in mind as we plan for commercialization.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, existing organizations have significant investments in legacy tools that must be integrated into new computational environments. 6. Multiple areas of expertise, disciplines, or tasks . Engineer ing engages people with multiple areas of expertise in one discipline (vertical integration) as well as experts from multiple disciplines (horizontal integration) <ref> (Konda et al., 1992) </ref>. 7. Multiple perspectives. People with the same area of exper tise or from the same discipline may have different perspectives about a particular project if they assume different roles in the collaborative effort. <p> Further, in each information space of the participants and in the product information space, the organization of information itself evolves as process and product understanding increase to form a shared memory <ref> (Konda et al., 1992) </ref>. The objective is to support the individual evolution of knowledge and the collective evolution of knowledge in the form of information structures that are constructed by the participants in the course of the product development process.

Reference-contexts: address the complexity of design contexts, one has to match it with a corresponding variety of building blocks and ways to connect them. n-dim: An Infrastructure for Information Modeling and Applications discusses our approach to identifying these building blocks and an infrastructure called n-dim within which they can be composed <ref> (Levy et al., 1993) </ref>. This section also reviews some basic features of n-dim, the continuously evolving infrastructure for developing design support systems. How n-dim Addresses a Variety of Information Activities illustrates how n-dims features and some applications we have developed address the complexity of engineering design contexts and work. <p> N-DIM : AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR INFORMATION MODELING AND APPLICATIONS The basic premise of the n-dim system is that every member in the product design team operates in an information space, called a workspace, that is characterized by the domain of experience and skill of the participant <ref> (Levy et al., 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The central problem here is that the information required to learn from the past is either not captured or is so poorly organized and documented that its retrieval and value is compromised <ref> (Petroski, 1989) </ref>. It is estimated that less than 20% of the intellectual capital of any firm is reused.

Reference-contexts: The basic features of our approach are: information flow studies (Finger et al., 1993; Subrahmanian et al., 1993a) which identify the specifics of the situation; user participation <ref> (Reich et al., 1996a) </ref> in as integrated a fashion as possible to engender the maximum possible com munication bandwidth as well as legitimacy and buy-in; rapid prototyping (Dutoit et al., 1996; Reich et al., 1996b) us ing specially developed infrastructures and languages designed for the prototype as opposed to class-based development;

Reference-contexts: In what follows, we describe several of these characteristics. An extended list with the consequences of creating design support systems can be found elsewhere <ref> (Reich et al., 1996b) </ref> 1. Extended time. Engineering activities extend over potential ly long periods of time. The context of design must be main tained over that period and longer to allow for future reuse and for addressing life cycle issues. 2. Multiple places.

Reference-contexts: Organizations, through their development, evolve distinct cultures consisting of different practices, policies, and behaviors. 4. Multiple languages . People from the same discipline but from different organizational departments or divisions often use different languages or terminologies to describe disciplinary knowledge <ref> (Sargent et al., 1992) </ref>. People themselves also use different languages (informal, e.g., text, images, audio, video; or formal, e.g., equations, 3D models) to refer to different perspectives of the same objects (Subrahmanian et al., 1993b). 5. Multiple tools.

Multiple tools. Some tasks, such as word processing, can be accomplished using different tools or methods. The use of different tools for the same tasks occurs in the same organization and certainly occurs in different organizations that work together.
