Title: TEACHING REASONING, BROADLY AND NARROWLY

Reference-contexts: I made only a very brief study. I looked for approaches to logical reasoning in a writing guide written by two English professors <ref> [1] </ref>, in a study guide for the Medical College Admissions Tests (MCAT) [3], and in the official information booklet for the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) [4]. The LSAT is very helpful for contemplating the scope of general reasoning. <p> such things as: Are the exercises graded, starting with one and two liners, and do they have sufficient topic variety, so the instructor can adjust the thrust depending on student interest? Is there a lot of emphasis on translating between words and "analytic statements" (S is convex () if 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and p; q 2 S, then p + (1)q 2 S)? Do students work enough with key concepts like the generic particular (if you want to show that S +T is convex, you have to show that for arbitrary p; q 2 S+T , something happens.

Reference-contexts: What does it mean to be an arbitrary p in S + T ?) If think my material does well on these scores, but so could a lot of other things. For instance, the discrete math book by Epp <ref> [2] </ref> has nice material on learning proofs using number theory. As for the second issue, general reasoning, I have suggested that this is properly viewed as a writing issue. Writing in mathematics courses has already increased, but much of it is informal, even emotive, "process" writing.

Reference-contexts: For 10 years, Swarthmore College has required that, in some courses in each discipline, students write "in the style of the discipline". Based on this, I am currently preparing a guide to writing mathematics for undergraduates <ref> [5] </ref>. Several excellent mathematics writing manuals have been published in recent years, but they are all aimed at professionals or graduate students. Two sections of my Guide deal with reasoning directly, one section on global issues, one on local.

Reference-contexts: So usually math students learn proving my osmosis in the process of learning some factual subject matter However, there are a few books devoted specifically to teaching how to prove. I recommend Solow's How to Read and Do Proofs <ref> [6] </ref> and Velleman's How to Prove It [8]. These books show how to take a mathematical claim and break it down, working backwards and forwards to create subgoals, until the task of proving it is divided into manageable pieces.

Reference-contexts: What is relevant is writing, and lots of discussion based around that writing. One possibility for teaching logic directly is to do only a small part of it, perhaps well before college. I once taught elementary logic to 7th graders (from Suppes-Hill <ref> [7] </ref>). It has a good combination of elementary symbolic deductions and translations in and out of words. Also, finite math books and discrete math books always contain some logic.

Reference-contexts: Problems with the Current Methods One can fault the current methods on at least three grounds: too indirect, suboptimal pedagogy, inappropriate subject matter. About indirection I have no objection; I'll say a bit more in a later section. About pedagogy, I tend to agree with a speech by Wilf <ref> [9] </ref>, where he says you've got to attack argumentation interactively, seminar style, with students writing and presenting proofs, students and teachers critiquing them, and students rewriting them. I strongly agree with Wilf's emphasis on learning through writing.
