Title: Two-Dimensional Fully Adaptive Solutions of Reaction-Diffusion Equations  
Author: Jens Lang 
Keyword: initial boundary value problem, Rothe method, embedded Rosenbrock method, finite elements, mesh refinement.  
Abstract: We present an adaptive Rothe method for two-dimensional problems combining an embedded Runge-Kutta scheme in time and a multilevel finite element discretization in space. The spatial discretization error is controlled by a posteriori error estimates based on interpolation techniques. A computational example for a thermodiffusive flame propagation model illustrates the high accuracy that is possible with the proposed method.

Reference-contexts: Over the years, several methods of adaptive techniques have been developed. Some of them have also been applied to time-dependent systems. Bietermann and Babu ska [7, 8] developed regridding methods for one-dimensional parabolic problems using finite element methods of lines procedures. Adjerid and Flaherty <ref> [1] </ref> additionally allowed to move the mesh during the temporal integration. Later they applied the method of lines to solve vector systems of parabolic partial differential equations on two-dimensional rectangular regions using bilinear finite element approximations [2].

Reference-contexts: All assumptions are quite general in the context of linear elliptic operators, see for instance <ref> [12] </ref>. Especially, the last inequality is related to the fact that the strict positivity of the operator H is in general disturbed by large positive eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix F u describing time-dependent growth of some solution components.

Our aim is to establish asymptotic interpolation errors for triangular meshes, trying not to loose any dependency of the error on the mesh geometry.

Clearly, new degrees of freedom should be placed only in those regions where the refinement leads to a significant reduction of the spatial error.

Reference-contexts: There is a general understanding that only implicit methods promise good results for stiff reaction-diffusion systems. From this point of view the most prominent mul-tistep, one-step or extrapolation methods are applicable <ref> [21] </ref>. To make an appropriate choice we have to take into account the second part of the whole discretization: find a spatial mesh at each time level well-adapted to the solution.

In contrast to the widespread method of lines there are several approaches exploiting the discretization sequence first in time then in space, well-known as classical Rothe method. So, Smooke <ref> [33] </ref> et al. applied an implicit Euler discretization and a two-dimensional spatial refinement that equidistributes a positive weight function over a given mesh interval in each direction at each time level. Bornemann established a new mathematical framework to analyze fully adaptive multilevel discretizations for scalar linear parabolic PDEs.

Reference-contexts: It requires the quotient of the diameter and the inner circle radius of the triangle to be bounded, or the well-known minimal angle condition to be satisfied. These assumptions are not useful for adaptive mesh refinement, where often small and long elements are needed. Synge <ref> [34] </ref> was probably the first who suggested that it is better to pay attention to angles that tend to rather than to those that tend to zero.
