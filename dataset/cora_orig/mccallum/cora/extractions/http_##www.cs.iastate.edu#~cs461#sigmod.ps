Abstract: A great deal of research has been focused on the development of database machines. In parallel to this work some vendors have developed general purpose machines with database function built directly into the machine architecture. The IBM AS/400 is one of the principle examples of this approach. Designed with a strong object orientation and the basis functions of the relational database model integrated into its architecture, the AS/400 has proved to be a commerical success. In the present work we look at the database component of the AS/400.

The primary architectural features of the AS/400 include the layered organization of function, the high-level machine interface, the notion of a single-level storage, the object orientation of the machine, capability-based addressing and the tagged pointer architecture. Each of these concepts will be discussed briey in the following paragraphs.
