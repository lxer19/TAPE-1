Reference-contexts: Question-answering, for example, might require a justification for an answer to be given: such a justification should be in the form of individual rules. Using viewpoints <ref> [1] </ref> to extract relevant sets of facts about a concept also requires some sort of deconstruction of the concept graph. Therefore, the following deconstruction algorithm is used to convert the modified Base graph back into a set of facts that shall serve as the new concept definition.

Reference-contexts: As reviewed in numerous papers <ref> [12, 3] </ref>, the classic theory of concepts, derived from Aristotle, views concepts as a set, or collection of entities. Entities are members of the concept if they possess certain necessary and sufficient definitional features. <p> Such an approach successfully addressed the earlier attacks against the classical view, but introduced its own problems. Perhaps the most serious was its inability to provide any standard of coherence for concept instances: an instance of a probabilistically-defined vehicle might contain both an engine, handlebars and a steering wheel <ref> [3] </ref>. Other accounts of concept structure proposed that concepts were organized around sets of examples of the concept, or prototypes [12]. Prototypes are synthesized from every instance of the concept encountered.

Reference-contexts: To address this problem, one must move beyond older mechanisms geared to outmoded accounts of concept structure. 3.2 Barsalou: Goal-Derived Concepts Barsalou's recent work <ref> [4, 5, 6] </ref> on category typicality uncovered further evidence for complex, theory-like category structure. Barsalou compared typicality effects for common taxonomic concepts (e.g. bird, plane, clothing) with those for ad-hoc concepts derived to achieve specific goals (e.g. foods not to eat on a diet, vacation locations). <p> In any case, it seems clear that this area is one of the most dependent on contextual knowledge for success. Another concern involving context has implications for concepts' very definitions. Barsalou <ref> [4] </ref> found evidence that only portions of concepts' full definitions are activated and used in particular contexts; a concrete explanation of how this occurs could be quite useful in understanding the tractability of human reasoning.

Reference-contexts: In frame systems, a single frame represents a concept; multiple frames are linked together via relations to form larger models of the world. In its most simple form, concept composition is represented by creating a new frame that is a specialization of two or more prior concepts <ref> [9] </ref>. For example, one could create the frame house-boat, giving it specialization links to two prior concepts house and boat. Because specialization links entail the inheritance of properties, house-boat gains all the properties of house and boat, such as inhabited by humans and floats on water.

These theorists persuasively argue that world knowledge plays a role in resolving each of the problems raised above.

Reference-contexts: of parent concepts (e.g. habitat and apartment), such techniques might be applied to find the proper composition of two concepts. 4.4 Compositional Modeling Compositional modeling is yet another method of building up complex concepts; it involves techniques of building formal logical models of physical systems via modular, composable model "fragments" <ref> [13] </ref>. A fragment models only a portion of the many relations, operations, or transformations that describe a particular physical phenomenon. For example, one fragment might model the voltage of a battery under certain assumptions. <p> ((?c) (?o :conditions (contains ?c ?o) (larger ?p ?o) (sealed ?p) (?o2 :conditions (not (contains ?c ?o2))))) assumptions ((CONSIDER (exists ?c))) relations ((not (touches ?o ?o2)))) (defModel (kayak ?k) individuals ((?k) (?s :conditions (seat ?s) (part-of ?s ?k)) (?c :conditions (cockpit ?c) (part-of ?c ?k)))) sented using Falkenhainer and Forbus' <ref> [13] </ref> conventions. 38 39 sented using conceptual graphs. 40 engineer. be reused to compose kayak with different fragments automatically.

Reference-contexts: At best, such parallel efforts waste time; at worst they introduce contradictions into the KB. Recent years have witnessed an emphasis on making more general-purpose knowledge bases whose representations are useful over multiple problem domains <ref> [14] </ref>. Part of this effort involves trying to make concept representations more modular in an attempt to make reuse of their components possible. However, any plan for modularity requires a method of efficiently and accurately composing concept "modules".

Reference-contexts: Because inheritance is based upon a similarity-based notion of concepts, it cannot model complex interactions between concept features and outside knowledge. Clearly, adequate accounts of features' interaction with both world knowledge and each other require more elaborate models of concepts and composition. 4.3 Analogy Analogical reasoning (see <ref> [15, 17] </ref>) is another method for transfer of knowledge about one concept or schema to another. Analogy involves transferring an entire set of relations relating one group of objects to another, so that the second group then has the same relations between them.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, rule systems providing the expressive power of full first-order logic without some way of restricting inference are potentially intractable. Therefore, a rule-based concept composition process must somehow circumscribe any inference performed in a composition process. <ref> [19] </ref> A final problem concerns knowledge engineering: rules systems are often much more difficult to understand and work with than are semantic nets and frames. 4.2 Frames and Inheritance A more tractable and intuitive model of concept composition involves frame representations and their associated inheritance methods.

Reference-contexts: Limiting fragments' scope to modular, discrete phenomena promotes their composability, making reuse and large-scale system modeling possible. Furthermore, the explicit packaging of each fragment's modeling assumptions with it makes feasible the construction of minimally complex models under varying assumptions and levels of detail <ref> [20] </ref>. Because of their emphasis on reuse and formal notions of relevance and simplicity, compositional modeling techniques are potentially quite useful to knowledge engineers.

Reference-contexts: Concept composition also has implications for various cognitive processes that seem to involve composition or be similar to it. Such processes include analogy and metaphor, language comprehension, and problem-solving <ref> [21] </ref>. Each process 2 relies upon a mechanism for concept composition, and is therefore potentially con-strained by such a mechanism's explanatory richness. This thesis presents an algorithm for concept composition that is based on ideas of conceptual structure proposed by Murphy and Medin [21] , who claim that concepts are at <p> analogy and metaphor, language comprehension, and problem-solving <ref> [21] </ref>. Each process 2 relies upon a mechanism for concept composition, and is therefore potentially con-strained by such a mechanism's explanatory richness. This thesis presents an algorithm for concept composition that is based on ideas of conceptual structure proposed by Murphy and Medin [21] , who claim that concepts are at least partially composed of theory-like sets of inter-related facts. I hope to show that the algorithm better explains our basic intuitions about new concepts and how they are formed. <p> Such accounts offer effective explanations not only of typicality, but also of concepts' apparent function of grouping correlated features. 3.1 Murphy and Medin: Concepts as Theories In recent years Murphy and Medin <ref> [21] </ref> emphasized the role of theoretical constructs in conceptual coherence. The two psychologists argued that concept definitions are at least partially characterized as theories: sets of interrelated structural and functional explanations or facts.

Reference-contexts: More complex accounts of composition involve the joining of only two basic concepts (frames): a base concept and modifer. As described by Murphy <ref> [22] </ref>, 12 composition essentially is a process of specialization of the base concept. The mod-ifier frame is inserted into a particular slot in the base concept's frame; this slot corresponds to a "mediating relation" that specifies how the two old concepts are related in the new composed concept.

Reference-contexts: I hope to demonstrate that my algorithm addresses limitations of each of the preceding composition models. 5.1 Representational Assumptions This algorithm uses representational assumptions found in recent theoretical accounts of concept structure. First, a conceptual graph representation similar to that found in Sowa <ref> [25] </ref> is used to represent concept definitions. This scheme can represent first-order and more complex logics; it also supports important features such as embedded units, default inheritance, value restrictions, token-type distinc 16 tions, etc. <p> Each concept is defined by a set of distinct facts represented via frames. The composition algorithm first uses a graph unification process <ref> [25] </ref> to combine each set of facts into single graphs. Facts from the Modifier concept are transferred to the Base concept by mapping all nodes and relations from the Modifier graph onto the Base graph. <p> The algorithm converts each set of facts into a unified graph via the use of conceptual join operations <ref> [25] </ref>. Join operations are graph versions of logical unification: two graphs, each representing a logical sentence, are combined by finding appropriate variable substitutions. The construction algorithm begins with one fact and progressively joins the remaining facts with it (Figs. 5.1 and 5.3).

Reference-contexts: Instead, the results showed a gradual increase in typicality proportional to the resemblance of an instance to the concept definition. Eventually, views of concepts with more flexible mechanisms determining category membership emerged. One such approach grew out of Zadeh's <ref> [27] </ref> the 5 ories of probabilistic reasoning. Zadeh defined concepts in terms of definitional features, but associated such features with instances probabilistically: a car might have a .9 chance of having a steering wheel, for example.
