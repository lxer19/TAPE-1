Abstract: We have implemented an application-independent collaboration manager, called Collagen, based on the SharedPlan theory of discourse, and used it to build a software interface agent for a simple air travel application. The software agent provides intelligent, mixed initiative assistance without requiring natural language understanding. A key benefit of the collaboration manager is the automatic construction of an interaction history which is hierarchically structured according to the user's and agent's goals and intentions.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, there is currently no generally accepted domain-independent theory of how people manage this interleaving. (The current best candidates for a generic theory are the so-called belief/desire/intention frameworks, such as <ref> (Bratman et al., 1988) </ref>.) Collagen therefore does not currently provide a generic framework for execution. Another way of saying this is that we provide a generic framework only for recording the order in which planning and execution occur, not for deciding how to interleave them. 3.2.

Reference-contexts: Task Modelling In order to use Collagen, an agent developer must provide a formal model of the collaborative task (s) being performed by the agent and user. Defining this model is very similar to what is called "data modelling" in data base or "domain modelling" in artificial intelligence <ref> (Brodie et al., 1982) </ref>. It also overlaps with modern specification practices in software engineering, although the goals and recipes in a collaborative discourse model include more abstract concepts than are usually formalized in current software practice, except for in expert or knowledge-based systems.

Reference-contexts: Grosz and Sidner's theory predicts that, for successful collaboration, the participants need to have mutual beliefs ? about the goals and actions to be performed and the capabilities, intentions, and commitments of the participants. The formal representation <ref> (Grosz and Kraus, 1996) </ref> of these aspects of the mental states of the collaborators is called a SharedPlan. <p> Cohen et al., for example, conclude that task initiative depends on who is proposing a goal. In contrast, our work is based on an underlying formalization <ref> (Grosz and Kraus, 1996) </ref> in which collaboration is fundamentally a property of groups. Although this distinction is not highlighted in our current scenarios, it will become important in future extensions.

Reference-contexts: This is an area for future work. It is tempting to think of discourse interpretation as the plan recognition problem, which is known to be exponential in the worst case <ref> (Kautz, 1990) </ref>. However, this misses a key property of normal human discourse, namely that speakers work hard to make sure that their conversational partners can understand their intentions without a large cognitive search.

These two recipes are: working forward on the legs of the trip starting at the originating city and working backward starting at the final destination. 12 C. RICH AND C. L.

A key concept in this window-sharing layer is the home window. The user and software agent each have a small dedicated window that is used for communication between them. <p> The agent observes the user's actions by virtue of a generic layer in the application that mirrors semantic actions into the input buffer of the agent process. The agent modifies the application state with its cursor (see discussion of "unGUI" module in <ref> (Rich, 1996) </ref>) and queries it using the programming interface (API) provided by the application. The user observes the agent's actions by watching the agent's cursor. The final two points above allow some design alternatives, which may be explored with other target applications.
