Reference-contexts: The details of the slot-stuffing protocol can be found in its specification <ref> [1] </ref>. 4.4 Software interfacing The host computer system needs software to be able to use the dtm host interface. This software is incorporated in the host operating system in the form of a device driver.

Reference-contexts: The parts of the device visible to the host are control registers and a 4 MB dual port memory for I/O buffers. For more information about the interface hardware design, see the dtm SBus hardware interface specification <ref> [2] </ref>. 6 DTM Slot-stuffing SAR Control Data 6 6 6 4.2 Segmentation and reassembly The dtm service provides a synchronous data channel with 64-bit data units. These units are too small for the host computer to process efficiently.

Reference-contexts: The service also has primitives for changing the allocated bandwidth. See the service specification for more details <ref> [3] </ref>. 4 3 SBus characteristics The SBus [8] is a chip-level interconnect bus between components such as processors and memory in systems based on microprocessors. It has a maximum clock frequency of 25 MHz, and a 32 or 64 bit data path.

Reference-contexts: When a slot with the end-of-frame flag set is received, a SAR-Data.indication primitive is issued. The details of the sar protocol can be found in its specification <ref> [4] </ref>. 4.3 Slot-stuffing To be able to implement the segmentation and reassembly protocol, two control flags are needed for every dtm data slot: one for indicating end-of-frame, and one for indicating an empty or idle slot. These flags are provided by a simple protocol which we call the slot-stuffing protocol.

Reference-contexts: It supports flexible and dynamic bandwidth reallocation, but avoids the overhead associated with the cells and cell headers of atm. dtm is being developed and implemented by a group of people at the Department of Telecommunication and Computer Systems at the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden <ref> [5] </ref>. The dtm group together with a group at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science, SICS, is designing a host interface for the network. The joint group has decided to design the interface for the Sun SPARCstation and its SBus. <p> Circuit switching makes it possible to do all time consuming work at connection setup. The data transfer phase is simple and implemented in hardware. The rest of this section gives an overview of the dtm. An article by Pehrson et al. <ref> [5] </ref> describes dtm in more detail. 2.1 Concepts The optical fiber network is organized as a dual fiber bus. Each node on the network is attached to both of the unidirectional fibers, which in the prototype have data rates of 622.08 Mbit/s.

Reference-contexts: The joint group has decided to design the interface for the Sun SPARCstation and its SBus. This choice was made because of the relative simplicity of the SBus, and because our present equipment mainly consists of Suns. This work is a part of the MultiG research program <ref> [7, 6] </ref> in Sweden. MultiG is a collaborative program for research in the area of multimedia applications and high speed networks.
