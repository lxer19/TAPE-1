Reference-contexts: The results were awful. It was obvious which books had been produced by computer and which not, and the former were a real pain to read no matter how good the content! (See the frank admission by the author of one such book |David Gries| in <ref> [2] </ref>.) In those days both the reader and the writer were expected to be "masochists"; at the time that development of Matsad began it was only the writer. Our goal was to relieve the writer's misery too.

Version Definition Even in situations where the L A T E X tabbing environment, as described in appendix C.9.1 (pages 179-181) of the L A T E X user's guide & reference manual <ref> [4] </ref>, ought to be appropriate it was found to be inadequate to the demands of automatic code generation and therefore a replacement has been developed for use with Matsad. The environment is called the mpdisplay environment and is defined in the mathpad.sty file (to be found in the latex subdirectory). <p> Another version of the command has an argument with can take the value 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. The value given indicates how strongly you wish the text to be broken at the point in question. LineBreak <ref> [4] </ref> forces a break whereas LineBreak [0] indicates no particular wish for a break. The only difference that the presence of LineBreak [0] makes is that a break can be made at the point even if it is not allowed in normal circumstances, for example in an already hyphenated word. <p> The commands NoLineBreak and NoLineBreak [T] are similar. Both NoLineBreak and Matsad 0.60 February 29, 1996 210 A. Advice for Newcomers to L A T E X NoLineBreak <ref> [4] </ref> prohibit a line break at the places at which they are placed, and a NoLineBreak [0] is the same as LineBreak [0]. Line breaks can also be made with the commands nn and NewLine from template LineBreak. <p> (/usr/TeX/lib/texmf/tex/latex2e/latexsym.sty 12 Package: `latexsym' v2.1a &lt;93/12/06&gt; (FMi) 13 English Documentation &lt;93/12/06&gt; (FMi)) 14 (/home/roland/tex/inputs/mpmacros.tex) 15 (/home/roland/tex/inputs/addfont.sty) 16 (head.sty) 17 Writing index file Guide.idx 18 (Guide.aux (Latexhelp.aux)) 19 (/usr/TeX/lib/texmf/tex/latex2e/Ulasy.fd) 20 (Latexhelp.tex 21 Chapter 1. 22 (Umathss.fd) [1] [2] 23 Underfull vbox (badness 5607) has occurred while output is active 24 [3] <ref> [4] </ref> [5] [6]) [7] (Guide.ind) (Guide.aux (Latexhelp.aux)) ) 25 (see the transcript file for additional information) 26 Output written on Guide.dvi (7 pages, 20784 bytes). 27 Transcript written on Guide.log. 28 Table A.2: A run of L A T E X.
