Abstract: A monotone boolean function f : - 0,1 - V fi - 0,1 is read-once if f can be expressed as a boolean formula over (AND, OR, NOT) in which every variable in V appears at most once. V. Gurvich (and independently Karchmer, Linial, Newman, Saks, and Wigderson) proved a necessary and sufficient condition for f to be read-once. In this paper we show necessary and sufficient conditions for f to be read-once on a given subset of its inputs. For Z V , we say that f is read-once on Z if f can be expressed as a formula in which every member of Z appears at most once. * This paper was prepared while the author was at U. C. Berkeley and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Support was provided by NSF Grant CCR-8411954, an AT&T Bell Labs GRPW Grant, and a grant from the Siemens Corporation.
