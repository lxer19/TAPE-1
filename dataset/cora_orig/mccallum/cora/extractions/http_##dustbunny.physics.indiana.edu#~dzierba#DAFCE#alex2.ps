Title: Scalar Mesons and Rare Radiative Decays of the Meson

Abstract: The scalar mesons, the f o (980) and the a o (980), have been receiving much attention of late. The low values of their masses and widths bring into question their assignment to the 3 P 0 qq scalar nonet and recent Crystal Barrel results have uncovered scalar states with more appropriate masses and widths. It has been suggested that the f o (980) and the a o (980) are molecules or 4-quark states. This talk will review recent results from BNL (Brookhaven AGS) experiment E852 in which the f o (980) and the a o (980) are produced in the and channels, respectively, in induced reactions. Hadroproduction characteristics of these states may reveal their nature. The a o (980) is also observed in f 1 (1285) ! . At JLAB (formerly CEBAF), an experiment is under construction to look for the rare radiative decays ! f o (980)fl and ! a o (980)fl. The ratio of these branching ratios is also expected to provide information on the substructure of these scalars. These measurements are feasible since intense photon beams will yield a high rate of 's. The possibility also exists of studying low-mass and scattering in 0 ! at BNL and JLAB.

Reference-contexts: Another striking feature of the plot is the dip at around 1 GeV. This is also seen in the S-wave projection, after a partial wave analysis (PWA) is performed (see Figure 4). This dip in the S-wave has been observed in other experiments <ref> [14] </ref> and is understood to be due to a narrow scalar at about 1 GeV in mass, interfering with a broad S-wave resonance (at about 1.3 GeV ?) The PWA also shows a rapid variation in the S-wave - D-wave phase (not shown here) at this mass, consistent with a narrow

A fit to the mass distribution, using a Breit-Wigner form and a cubic background, yields masses and widths consistent with the Particle Data Group.
