Reference-contexts: Following this line of thought one can try to identify the most appropriate second step to be taken: dynamics agents (Beer, 1995); agents that are able to build an internal representation of the environment during their interaction with the environment itself <ref> (Asada, 1990) </ref>; agents that learn to predict the consequence of their actions and can use this knowledge to choose between alternative actions (Tani, 1996); agents able to learn by imitation (Bekker & Kuniyoshi, 1996). We believe that all the research lines mentioned above are valuable and can produce important insights.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The word consciousness is often used by referring to different meanings. Moreover different level of consciousness may be identified <ref> (see Chalmers, 1995) </ref>. In this paper we will deal with the very first levels of consciousness from an evolutionary point of view. In particular we will try to investigate in which conditions we can expect the emergence of internal representations in populations of evolving agents interacting with an external environment.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the disregard of angular cue 9 information is evidence in rats of the presence of a cerebral module of the environmental shape in the Fodor sense <ref> (Fodor, 1983) </ref>. Given the elegance of this experimental framework and the large amount of data painstakingly collected by Gallistel, Cheng and by other researchers on rats we decided to try to train a Khepera robot to perform this task.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, only limited results have been obtained by research on autonomous robotics in recent years. Some notable results have been obtained <ref> (e.g. Nilsson, 1984) </ref>, however "such robots seemed to have reached a ceiling in terms of what they can do" (Sharkey & Heemskerk, in press). This partial failure is a clear demonstration that it is difficult to apply traditional cognitive models to mobile robots.

Reference-contexts: The lack of internal representations and internal dynamic is overcome by exploiting the power of sensory-motor coordination. Agents who 12 interact with an external environment can partially select the sensory stimuli they encounter <ref> (Nolfi & Parisi, 1993) </ref>. This ability is used to select favorable sensory stimuli, i.e. environmental situations that, given the way in which the agent reacts to incoming stimuli, allow it to reach the desired goal. <p> The general strategy with which sensory-motor controllers solve their tasks can be described as follows: by acting in the environment they can self-select the type of stimuli to which they will be exposed to <ref> (see Nolfi & Parisi, 1993) </ref>. This allows them to select favorable environmental conditions and to avoid unfavorable ones. Consider for example the behavior described in Figure 3. This individual is 19 supposed to reach one corner of the environment.

Reference-contexts: find food by evaluating them only for the number of food elements collected during their lives and at the same time can be trained to predict the sensory consequences of their actions by using a supervised learning algorithm (such as backpropagation) that uses the next sensory pattern as teaching input <ref> (see Nolfi & Elman & Parisi, 1994) </ref>. If the ability to predict the sensory consequences of one's own actions requires an internal representation that keeps track of the previous sensory stimuli, we will of course observe the emergence of such internal representations.

Reference-contexts: However, we have the feeling that something similar to what used to be said for traditional A.I., the "ceiling" effect, is going to be manifested here too. Systems displaying behavior of remarkable complexity have been obtained <ref> (see for example Scheier & Lambrinos, 1995) </ref>. However, most of the reported work proposes different algorithms or architectures to obtain the same simple behaviors more effectively and only a few really address the problem of obtaining significantly more complex behavior.

We believe that all the research lines mentioned above are valuable and can produce important insights. <p> In other words, by forcing individuals to develop internal representations and at the same time by leaving them free to develop their own solutions to the task, one might expect them to combine the power of sensory-motor coordination with that of internal representations <ref> (Cf. Tani, 1996) </ref>. 22 Aknowledgments This research has been granted by the Project on Real Time Computing in Real World of the National Research Council, Italy.
