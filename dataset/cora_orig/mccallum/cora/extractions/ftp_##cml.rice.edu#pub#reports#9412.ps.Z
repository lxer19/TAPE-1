Reference-contexts: They provide a localized basis, and can represent square-integrable functions, but also constant and, more generally, polynomial functions in a locally finite manner. In 1988 Daubechies' fundamental paper on wavelets <ref> [1] </ref> appeared. In this paper we find for the first time a parametrized family of orthonormal systems of functions in L 2 (R) with certain important complementary properties. <p> One of the powers of wavelet technology is the ability to choose the defining coefficients for a given wavelet system to be best adapted to the given problem. Daubechies developed in her original paper <ref> [1] </ref> specific families of wavelet systems which had maximal vanishing moments of the function and which were very good for representing polynomial behavior.

Reference-contexts: In particular, one obtains an efficient multiscale algorithm for solving the model problem involving Laplace's equation for a domain with a very general boundary <ref> [3] </ref>. Moreover, a second model problem involving anisotropic coefficients in two dimensions with periodic boundary values admits a robust multigrid algorithm whose condition number is independent of the mesh size and of the anisotropy parameter [7].

Reference-contexts: In the industrial world, there has been developments at Aware, Inc., Lockheed, Martin-Marietta, TRW, Kodak, Exxon, and many others. The government agencies supporting wavelet research and development include ARPA, ONR, AFOSR, NASA, and many other agencies. The recent literature in the past five years includes a recent book <ref> [6] </ref> which is an index of citations in the past decade on this subject, and it contains over 1,000 references and abstracts. 2 WAVELET MATHEMATICS Fundamentally, wavelets are a new type of function which provide an excellent orthonormal basis for functions of one or more variables.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, a second model problem involving anisotropic coefficients in two dimensions with periodic boundary values admits a robust multigrid algorithm whose condition number is independent of the mesh size and of the anisotropy parameter <ref> [7] </ref>. In these multigrid applications of wavelets to numerical analysis the linear Mallat algorithms (transform from single scale to multiscale and conversely) play a major role.

Reference-contexts: To recover the signal, one reverses the process with the exception of the quantization step, as those bits cannot be recovered. For further details about this compression process in the context of images, see, e.g., <ref> [12] </ref>, and more information about specific technologies in all of the areas above is available, in particular, from Aware, Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.
