Abstract: Lovelace is a free interactive tutorial for Ada 95 [RM 95] and is available through the World Wide Web (WWW). This paper describes Lovelace, including basic facts about it, its organization, implementation, user comments, and lessons learned. This paper should be of use to educators considering the use of Lovelace in courses using Ada, users of Love-lace, and educators considering the development of computer-aided instruction programs for the World Wide Web (WWW). The purpose of Lovelace is to teach the Ada 95 computer programming language, with sufficient coverage so the user can become a beginning Ada programmer. Lovelace is intended for software developers who know another algorithmic programming language (such as C, C++, Fortran, or Pascal) but who do not know Ada. The current version of Lovelace as of this writing is version 4.3. This version has 68 sections grouped into 17 lessons. Its text includes more than 54,000 words and it is stored in 273 HTML files. Lovelace would occupy more than 300 pages if printed. 1 The publication of this paper does not indicate endorsement by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) nor the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), nor should the contents be construed as reecting the official positions of those organizations.
