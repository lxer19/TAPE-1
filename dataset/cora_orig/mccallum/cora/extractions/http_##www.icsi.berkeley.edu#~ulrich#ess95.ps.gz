The OSSCAR class library provides a powerful set of load generators and network simulators for simulating slotted high speed networks, such as ATM, DQDB, and CRMA-II.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction OSSCAR (object oriented simulation of slotted communication architectures) is being developed at the University of Erlangen-Nurnberg as a simulation tool for the performance evaluation of slotted high speed networks under copmlex multimedia load configuration. OSSCAR is based on the simulation packet CNCL (communication network class library <ref> [6] </ref>) from the Technical University of Aachen. CNCL provides a powerful set of C++ classes supporting event-driven simulations. 1 The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief overview of OSSCAR's underlying modeling methodology. <p> Using object-oriented programming and event-driven simulation technique supported by the CNCL <ref> [6] </ref>, a BASE class library was implemented, abstractly specifying the universal features of slotted communication architectures. The BASE classes represent the network components such as physical links, stations, and services offered. For an actual simulation, specialized classes are derived from the BASE classes.
