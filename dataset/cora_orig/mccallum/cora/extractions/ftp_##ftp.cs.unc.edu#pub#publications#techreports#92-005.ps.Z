Abstract: We describe initial results which show live ultrasound echography data visualized within a pregnant human subject. The visualization is achieved by using a small video camera mounted in front of a conventional head-mounted display worn by an observer. The cameras video images are composited with computer-generated ones that contain one or more 2D ultrasound images properly transformed to the observers current viewing position. As the observer walks around the subject, the ultrasound images appear stationary in 3-space within the subject. This kind of enhancement of the observers vision may have many other applications, e.g., image guided surgical procedures and on location 3D interactive architecture preview.

Reference-contexts: To reconstruct a 3D image from images of a lesser dimension, the location and orientation of the imaging primitives must be known. Coordinate values are explicitly tracked either acoustically <ref> [Brinkley 1978; King 1990; Moritz 1983] </ref>, mechanically [Geiser 1982a; Geiser 1982b; Hottier 1989; McCann 1988; Ohbuchi 1990; Raichelen 1986; Stickels 1984], or optically [Mills 1990]. <p> The visual form can be classified further by the rendering primitives used, which can be either geometric (e.g., polygons) or image-based (e.g., voxels). Many early studies focused on non-invasively estimating of the volume of the heart chamber <ref> [Brinkley 1978; Ghosh 1982; Raichelen 1986; Stickels 1984] </ref>. Typically, 2D echography (2DE) images were stored on video tape and manually processed offline. Since visual presentation was of secondary interest, wire frames or a stack of contours were often used to render geometrical reconstructions.

Reference-contexts: A particularly interesting system under development at Philips Paris Research Laboratory is one of the closest yet to a real-time 3D ultrasound scanner <ref> [Collet Billon 1990] </ref>. It is a follow on to earlier work which featured a manually guided scanner with mechanical tracking [Hottier 1990]. <p> Repetitive low-pass filtering was used during reconstruction to fill the spaces between radial slices, which suppressed aliasing artifacts. [Tomographic Technologies 1991] provides flexible re-slicing by up to 6 planes as well other imaging modes. <ref> [Collet Billon 1990] </ref> uses two visualization techniques: re-slicing by an arbitrary plane and volume rendering. The former allows faster but only 2D viewing on a current workstation. The latter allows 3D viewing but often involves cumbersome manual segmentation. The reconstruction algorithm uses straightforward low pass filtering. 3.

Reference-contexts: This makes it the preferred imaging technique for fetal examination, cardiac study, and guided surgical procedures such as fine-needle aspiration biopsy of breast tumors <ref> [Fornage 1990] </ref>. Ultrasound echography offers the best real-time performance in 3D data acquisition, although slower imaging modalities such as MRI are improving. The drawbacks of ultrasound imaging include a low signal to noise ratio and poor spatial resolution. Ultrasound images exhibit speckle which appears as grainy areas in images. <p> The 2D images overlap but are roughly parallel at approximately 2mm intervals. 4. Virtual Environment Ultrasound Imaging Various medical ultrasound imaging applications require a registration of ultrasound images with anatomical references, e.g., in performing a fine needle aspiration biopsy of a suspected breast tumor <ref> [Fornage 1990] </ref>. A virtual environment which displays images acquired by ultrasound equipment in place within a patients anatomy could facilitate such an application. We have developed an experimental system that displays multiple 2D medical ultrasound images overlaid on real-world images.

Reference-contexts: The ultrasound images are distributed among the GPs where they are clipped to remove unnecessary margins and transformed into sphere primitives, which are then sent to the Renderer boards for direct rasterization. Pixel-Planes5 renders spheres very rapidly, even faster than it renders triangles, over 2 million per second <ref> [Fuchs 1985; 1989] </ref>. Final images are assembled in double buffered NTSC frame buffers for display on the HMD. To reduce the number of sphere primitives displayed, the ultrasound images are filtered and subsampled at every 4th pixel.

Reference-contexts: These images are digitized by a SUN4 with a Matrox MVP/S real-time video digitizer and transferred to our Pixel-Planes5 graphics multicomputer <ref> [Fuchs 1989] </ref>. The SUN4 operates as a 2DE image server for requests from the Pixel-Planes5 system. Images are distributed among the Graphics Processors (GPs) on a round-robin scan-line by scan-line basis. Due to the bandwidth limitations of the SUN4 VME bus, transfer of the 5124808bits/pixel images is limited to 2Hz.

Reference-contexts: This incremental volume rendering algorithm is not restricted to ultrasound and is applicable to other problems which update volume data incrementally, e.g., interactive volume modeling by sculpting <ref> [Galyean 1991] </ref>. To test this visualization technique, we acquired a series of 2D images with a manually guided conventional 2DE scanhead attached to a mechanical tracking arm with 3DOF (two translations and one rotation).

Reference-contexts: The reconstructed volume is then rendered with an incremental volume-rendering technique. The reconstruction is a 4D convolution process. A 3D Gaussian kernel is used for spatial reconstruction followed by a temporal reconstruction based on simple auto regressive moving average (ARMA) filtering <ref> [Haddad 1991] </ref>. Time stamps are assigned to each 3D voxel, which are updated during reconstruction. The time stamp difference between a reconstructed voxel and an incoming sample is used to compute coefficients for the ARMA filter.

An image-order, ray-casting algorithm based on [Levoy 1988] renders the final images incrementally. Rendering is incremental and fast only if the viewpoint is fixed and if the updated volume is relatively small. Shading and ray sampling are done only for voxels proximate to incoming data.

An interesting extension to 2D display is a system that tracks the location and orientation of 2D image slices with 6 DOF <ref> [King 1990] </ref>. On each 2D displayed image, the system overlays lines indicating the intersection of the current image with other 2D images already acquired. The authors claim that these lines help the viewer understand the relationship of the 2D image slices in 3D space.

Reference-contexts: Incremental Volume Visualization We have been experimenting with volume rendering as one alternative for visualizing dynamic ultrasound volume data. Standard volume rendering techniques which rely heavily on preprocessing do not apply well to dynamic data which must be visualized in real time <ref> [Levoy 1988; Sabella 1988; Upson 1988] </ref>.

The observer often steps inadvertently out of tracker range, and even while keeping very still the observer must cope with objects in the synthetic image swimming in place.

Our target function is sampled at irregular points and may change over time. Instead of directly visualizing samples from this target, we reconstruct a regular 3D volume from this time series of spatially irregular sample points.

Reference-contexts: Our ultimate system design requires advances in both 3D volume data acquisition and 3D volume data display. Our collaborators, Dr. Olaf von Ramms group at Duke University, are working toward real-time 3D volume data acquisition <ref> [Smith 1991; von Ramm 1991] </ref>. At UNC-Chapel Hill, we have been conducting research on real-time 3D volume data visualization. <p> Dr. Olaf von Ramms group at Duke University is developing a 3D scanner which will acquire 3D data in real time <ref> [Shattuck 1984; Smith 1991; von Ramm 1991] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The visual form can be classified further by the rendering primitives used, which can be either geometric (e.g., polygons) or image-based (e.g., voxels). Many early studies focused on non-invasively estimating of the volume of the heart chamber <ref> [Brinkley 1978; Ghosh 1982; Raichelen 1986; Stickels 1984] </ref>. Typically, 2D echography (2DE) images were stored on video tape and manually processed offline. Since visual presentation was of secondary interest, wire frames or a stack of contours were often used to render geometrical reconstructions.

Reference-contexts: A commercial product, the Echo-CT system by Tomographic Technologies, GMBH, uses the linear translation of a transducer inside a tube inserted into the esophagus to acquire parallel slices of the heart. Image acquisition is gated by respiration and an EKG to reduce registration problems <ref> [Tomographic Technologies 1991] </ref>. 2.2 3D Ultrasound Image Display One should note that 3D image data can be presented not only in visual form, but also as a set of calculated values, e.g., a ventricular volume. <p> Repetitive low-pass filtering was used during reconstruction to fill the spaces between radial slices, which suppressed aliasing artifacts. <ref> [Tomographic Technologies 1991] </ref> provides flexible re-slicing by up to 6 planes as well other imaging modes. [Collet Billon 1990] uses two visualization techniques: re-slicing by an arbitrary plane and volume rendering. The former allows faster but only 2D viewing on a current workstation.

Reference-contexts: Incremental Volume Visualization We have been experimenting with volume rendering as one alternative for visualizing dynamic ultrasound volume data. Standard volume rendering techniques which rely heavily on preprocessing do not apply well to dynamic data which must be visualized in real time <ref> [Levoy 1988; Sabella 1988; Upson 1988] </ref>. We review here an incremental , interactive, 3D ultrasound visualization technique which visualizes a 3D volume as it is incrementally updated by a sequence of registered 2D ultrasound images [Ohbuchi 1990; 1991].

Reference-contexts: Developers of some multi-million dollar flight simulators have studied predictive trackingfor many years, but unfortunately for us, they have not, to our knowledge, published details of their methods and their methods' effectiveness. For the immediate future, we are planning to move to our locally-developed ceiling tracker <ref> [Ward 1992] </ref> and use predictive tracking. 3) Tracking system range and stability: Even though we are using the most popular and probably most effective commercially available tracking system from Polhemus, we are constantly plagued by limitations in tracking volume and tracking stability [Liang 1991]. <p> Many schemes have been casually proposed over the years, but we know of no device that has been built and demonstrated. Even the roomsize tracker we built and demonstrated for a week at SIGGRAPH91 still needs special ceiling panels with infrared LEDs <ref> [Ward 1992] </ref>. 4) Head-mounted display system resolution: For many of the applications envisioned, the image quality of current head-mounted video displays is totally inadequate.

Reference-contexts: Previous Research in 3D Ultrasound The advantages of ultrasound echography are that it is relatively safe compared with other imaging modalities and that images are generated in real time <ref> [Wells 1977] </ref>. This makes it the preferred imaging technique for fetal examination, cardiac study, and guided surgical procedures such as fine-needle aspiration biopsy of breast tumors [Fornage 1990]. Ultrasound echography offers the best real-time performance in 3D data acquisition, although slower imaging modalities such as MRI are improving.
