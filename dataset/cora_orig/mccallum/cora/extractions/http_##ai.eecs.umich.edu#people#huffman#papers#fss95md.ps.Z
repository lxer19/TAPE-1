Reference-contexts: KQML [Finin et al., 1994] provides an interprocess communication language for information agents, but makes few commitments about the semantics of the meta-information to be communicated. MCC's Carnot project [Collet et al., 1991] introduced some of the necessary computational infrastructure with concept matching and resource models. The SIMS project <ref> [Arens et al., 1993] </ref> exploits some semantic and run-time meta-information to produce efficient query plans. Yet there has been little reported in the literature on exactly what meta-information is important for describing real-world task contexts. We present our preliminary findings on this subject in this paper. <p> Although this work is certainly relevant, a higher level of abstraction than is available in traditional database terminology may be needed to describe meta-information about content, form, quality and resources for knowledge services. We therefore follow SIMS <ref> [Arens et al., 1993] </ref> and Carnot [Collet et al., 1991] in shifting the level of abstraction upwards from relations among database attributes to relations among concepts. Here the term concept corresponds to the informal standard sense as referring to an abstract entity.

Reference-contexts: If the tools we build are to make knowledge navigation in the business world any easier, they will have to exploit, or at least represent, this type of meta-information in choosing information search and retrieval strategies.

Reference-contexts: For the example sentence above, an automated system must know enough to report Murphy's name and title, rather than Eisner's. To perform this task we built an information extraction system called ODIE <ref> [Huffman, 1995] </ref>, which looks for shallow linguistic patterns using local syntactic relationships. To deliver the information, we use Lotus Notes (TM), which combines much of the functionality of electronic mail, bulletin boards, and information repositories within a unified interface.

Reference-contexts: For each concept, there is mapping knowledge that can be used to translate a concept into some representation in a particular source, and vice versa. This abstraction level is essentially the "knowledge level" <ref> [Newell, 1981] </ref> specialized to knowledge navigation. One could imagine an extended SQL style of notation for specifying a knowledge service's concepts 1 In this paper we will enclose concept names in brackets. and associated meta-information.
