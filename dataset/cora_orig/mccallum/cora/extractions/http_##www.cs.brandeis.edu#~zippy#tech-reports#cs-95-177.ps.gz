Reference-contexts: This is half the chance of detecting eavesdropping using two unbiased coins. This gives a quantum cryptography technique which requires the mint to produce only two states. While quantum cryptography systems with two states are known <ref> [1] </ref>, this analysis shows that a standard quantum cryptographic system works with only two states. Eve's optimum strategy turns out to be a pure strategy (ie., a single move), which is a simple function of P r and P 0 .

At this time we are ignoring the possibility of making a measurement or creating a photon at some angle between the two basis sets, such as a Breidbart basis <ref> [3] </ref>. 4.2 Assumptions * No photons change state except as a result of measurements. 3 * The random number generator Alice uses provides uncorrelated random bits with some bias known to Eve. * All attempts to detect a photon succeed. * We ignore noise.

Reference-contexts: Reducing the number of different polarizations necessary (which equipment must produce) substantially reduces the cost of building associated equipment [9]. If the mint knows that it has a biased random number generator and uses a coin fairing scheme <ref> [6] </ref>, this shows that it need fair only some of the coins well, and that the mint can accept a large bias in the others. By demonstrating a limit on the amount of fairing which is beneficial, this permits the mint to use fewer tosses of its biased random coins.
