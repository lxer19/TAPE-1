Abstract: A robotic platform controlled by a neuronal simulation is presented for studying the mechanisms underlying the firing of hippocampal place cells and how they support navigation. The sensors on the robot provide visual, odometric and short-range proximity information which are combined to estimate the distance of the walls of the enclosure from the robot and its current heading direction. These inputs drive a neuronal simulation of the hippocampus in which the robot's location is represented as the firing of place cells. If a goal location is encountered, connection strengths are incremented between active place cells and a set of `goal cells' which guide subsequent navigation (Burgess et al., 1994), allowing the robot to return to goal locations. The system shows good agreement with actual place cell firing, and makes predictions regarding the firing of cells in the subiculum and the locus of search of rats after deformation of their environment.

Reference-contexts: However objects placed within the environment do not show this control (Cressant et al., 1996). Interoceptive inputs relating to self-motion (possibly vestibular) also influence the overall orientation of place (Sharp et al., 1995; Jeffery et al., 1997) and head-direction <ref> (Blair & Sharp, 1996) </ref> representations. In uniform rectangular walled environments place cells' receptive fields (`place fields') appear to be composed of the thresholded sum of two or more separate Gaussian tuning curves, each peaked at a fixed distance from one wall of the environment (O'Keefe & Burgess, 1996).

Reference-contexts: These remarkable properties of cell firing are derived from relatively unsophisticated sensory inputs. Rats have wide angle vision <ref> (320 360 ffi depending on head angle, Hughes 1977) </ref> but do not necessarily segment stimuli into objects or extract much sensory information beyond the location or motion of the Proc. AISB workshop on "Spatial Reasoning in Mobile Robots and Animals", Manchester 1997.
