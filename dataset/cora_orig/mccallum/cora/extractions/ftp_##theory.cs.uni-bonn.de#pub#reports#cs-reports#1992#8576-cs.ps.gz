Reference-contexts: By this change of the coordinates we obtain a new algebraic function ~ Y and its graph ~ Y . In addition we suppose that ~ Y is an irreducible (in the Zariski topology over IR, see <ref> [BCR 87] </ref>) component of the semialgebraic set f ~ f = 0g " IR n+1 + . We call f a t-sparse representation of Y . If t is the least possible we call f a minimal t-sparse representation. 2. <p> numbers of fh = 0g does not exceed 2 t 2 Note that in the above proposition, the i-th Betti number b i (fh = 0g) is defined as the rank of i-th cohomology group H i (fh = 0g; IR) with real coefficients, see e.g. [ES 52], [D 80], <ref> [BCR 87] </ref>). A similar bound is true if we change the hypothesis above to consider singular varieties that are compact. Corollary 2. Let h 2 IR [X 1 ; : : : ; X n ] be a t-sparse polynomial such that fh = 0g ae IR n is compact. <p> Then the sum of Betti numbers of fh = 0g does not exceed 2 (O (tn) 2 ) . Proof. We follow closely the arguments in Theorem 2 [M 64] or Proposition 11.5.4 <ref> [BCR 87] </ref>. Assume that fh = 0g lies in a ball of radius R.

We design an algorithm for finding the exponent vectors of all minimal (normalized) t 1 -sparse representations of a t-sparse (so t 1 t) real algebraic function Y (see the theorem at the end of the paper).

Corollary 2. <p> We then have K (* i ; ffi i ) oe K (* i+1 ; ffi i+1 ) and T K (* i ; ffi i ) = K. Therefore H fl (K) is the direct limit (see e.g. <ref> [ES 52] </ref>) of the groups H fl K (* i ; ffi i ) and so rank H fl (K) = lim (rank H fl K (* i ; ffi i )). This proves the corollary. 2 We now formulate the main result of this section. 4 Lemma 3. <p> The Alexander duality principle (see [D 80]) implies ~ H 0 (S n n U (S n+1 ) ) = H n1 (U (S n+1 ) ), in particular the latter group is nontrivial, thus b n1 (U (S n+1 ) ) 1.

Reference-contexts: In Section 4 we describe an algorithm which finds the exponent vectors of all the minimal t-sparse representations of a real algebraic function (interpolation algorithm). It uses a Wronskian formulation of linear dependence (see e.g. <ref> [K 73] </ref>) which appeared to be helpful also for sparse rational function interpolation ([GKS 90b, GKS 91a, GKS 91b]) and which allows to describe the family of exponent vectors as a solution of a system (over IR) of a polynomial equations. <p> (1) +:::+b (t1) (t1) 2 (1) n ; b (1) ; : : : ; a 1 ; : : : ; a (t1) 10 Observe that deg a (1) deg Y (W D 1 ;:::;D t1 ) (t 1) 2 (W D 1 ;:::;D t1 ) t 1 From <ref> [K 73] </ref>, p. 83, it follows that 1 + P c i X 1 n n Y b (i) = 0 (so the exponents a 1 ; : : :; a n ; b (i) provide a normalized t-sparse representation) for suitable c i 2 IR iff W D 1 ;:::;D

The proof invokes the bounds from <ref> [K 91] </ref> (Proposition 1) on the sum of Betti numbers of a real algebraic variety given by a sparse polynomial.
