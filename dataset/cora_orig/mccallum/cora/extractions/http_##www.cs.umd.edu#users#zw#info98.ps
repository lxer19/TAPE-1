Abstract: Feasible region is a simple and optimal framework for scheduling the transmission of data with deadlines. In this paper, we establish the fundamental relationship between the bandwidth requirement and the initial delay in feasible-region-based transmission scheduling. The relationship represents the optimal bandwidth/delay tradeoff. In the process, we identify the essential bandwidth, the exact bandwidth lower bound regardless of initial delay. Efficient algorithms are given to calculate the essential bandwidth as well as the optimal bandwidth/delay tradeoff. The results extend the previous results on feasible-region-based scheduling, most of which derived in the context of video traffic smoothing. When applied to the problem of scheduling scalable multimedia, we show that the feasible region framework enables the integrated scheduling of presentation and transmission and is a new and promising approach of dealing with scalable multimedia. We establish the presentation feasibility condition and present some initial results on scheduling spatial scalability.

Reference-contexts: In essence, we have an algorithm that computes the entire spectrum of optimal schedules with continuous bandwidth and delay tradeoffs in O (N ) time. 5 Bandwidth-Constrained Scheduling of Scalable Multimedia Recently, numerous research activities have been reported integrating multimedia objects with varying timing requirements in a multimedia presentation <ref> [1, 2, 11] </ref>. Their main results were centered around the formal specification and modeling of multimedia composition and the development of synchronization tools such as the automatic scheduling of presentation times. <p> The former refers to the actual presentation content generation and the latter schedules the transmission of data. In bandwidth-constrained environment, the bandwidth limit imposes a constraint on the transmission schedule, which in turn restricts the possible presentation. There have been approaches to treat the two problems separately such as <ref> [1, 10] </ref>. There are also approaches to concatenate the two stages into a feedback loop such as [3], where presentations are generated until the resulted transmission schedule satisfies the resource constraints. We propose the approach of integrated presentation-transmission scheduling.

Reference-contexts: We apply the feasible region framework to the problem of bandwidth-constrained scalable multimedia scheduling. Scalable multimedia is a general framework of multimedia presentations consisting of multimedia objects with spatial and/or temporal scalabilities, and is an effective way of handling receiver heterogeneity and limited or changing bandwidth situations <ref> [6] </ref>. In scalable multimedia, actual presentations are generated through presentation scheduling with the given constraints and scalabilities. Based on our results of optimal bandwidth/delay tradeoff, we derive the exact feasibility condition for scalable multimedia presentation with a given bandwidth constraint.

However, we can find a "maximal" feasible presentation very efficiently. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the framework of feasible-region-based transmission scheduling and the optimal smoothing algorithm from <ref> [15] </ref>. Section 3 presents the definitions and properties of essential bandwidth and critical delay. In Section 4, we derive the optimal bandwidth/delay tradeoff.

A transmission schedule is valid if and only if it lies within the feasible region. ing algorithm An optimal smoothing algorithm was given in <ref> [15] </ref>. The algorithm produces a piecewise linear transmission schedule that is as smooth as possible, with the minimum peak rate and minimum rate variance. The algorithm is straightforward: starting with y = 0, the algorithm looks for the longest linear segment within the feasible region (Figure 1 (b)). <p> The algorithm runs in the same linear time as algorithm A . ut 4 Optimal Bandwidth/Delay Tradeoff Let the optimal schedule obtained by algorithm A with delay d = 0 be S fl (0). Using the notions in <ref> [15] </ref>, each point at which the slope of the schedule changes is either a concave change point where the rate decreases, or a convex change point where the rate increases. <p> The relationship follows. ut We point out that our results extend the previous results of <ref> [15, 8] </ref>, where an optimal schedule is calculated given an initial delay. We have an algorithm that computes the entire optimal bandwidth/delay tradeoff relationship, in the same O (N ) time. The bandwidth/delay relationship is essential for applications in making optimal tradeoff decisions between bandwidth reservation and presentation delay.
