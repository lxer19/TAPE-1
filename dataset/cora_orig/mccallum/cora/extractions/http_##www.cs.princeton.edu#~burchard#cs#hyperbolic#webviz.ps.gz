Title: Visualizing the Structure of the World Wide Web in 3D Hyperbolic Space  
Author: Tamara Munzner Paul Burchard 
Affiliation: The Geometry Center, University of Minnesota  Department of Mathematics, University of Utah  
Abstract: We visualize the structure of sections of the World Wide Web by constructing graphical representations in 3D hyperbolic space. The felicitous property that hyperbolic space has "more room" than Euclidean space allows more information to be seen amid less clutter, and motion by hyperbolic isometries provides for mathematically elegant navigation. The 3D graphical representations, available in the We-bOOGL or VRML file formats, contain link anchors which point to the original pages on the Web itself. We use the Geomview/WebOOGL 3D Web browser as an interface between the 3D representation and the actual documents on the Web. The Web is just one example of a hierarchical tree structure with links "back up the tree" i.e. a directed graph which contains cycles. Our information visualization techniques are appropriate for other types of directed graphs with cycles, such as filesystems with symbolic links.

See <ref> [2] </ref> for more details on visualizing 3-manifolds from this "insider's" point of view. However, due to the multiple images, sophisticated level-of-detail culling (beyond the abilities our first-generation software) is required to render the view inside a manifold efficiently.

Reference-contexts: Geomview is a public domain 3D viewer which runs on SGI, X, and NeXTStep workstations 8 . The original WebOOGL system demoed in 1994 [6] had a very different structure than the current WebOOGL 2.0 configuration. See <ref> [5] </ref> for details on the WebOOGL system. 5 Additional Directions The structure of the Web is just one of many potential applications of visualizing directed graphs with cycles. The file format expected by the webviz program can easily be generated by programs other than a Webspider.

The original Euclidean version demonstrated in 1994 was called web-space. Due to the release of the popular VRML browser by that name from SGI 6 , we have renamed the hyperbolic version webviz.

Reference-contexts: We construct a 3D graphical representation of a piece of this structure, drawing tetrahedra at the nodes and lines between them to represent hyperlinks. Our layout is a variant of the Xerox PARC Cone Tree <ref> [9] </ref>, where the parent node is at the tip of the cone and the edges leading to the children are drawn radiating outwards to the rim. The problem, as we can see in Figure 1, is that our cone trees become cluttered very quickly.

Reference-contexts: Their work on information visualization is confined to the 2D hyperbolic plane, and deals only with acyclic graphs. Hyperbolic space has a similar visual effect to a fisheye camera lens, used by <ref> [10] </ref> for information visualization. The fisheye paradigm calls for several ad-hoc decisions, the advantage of hyperbolic geometry is it provides an elegant and powerful mathematical framework for display and navigation. 3 Layout The graph can be easily laid out in the hyperbolic plane using uniform edge lengths.
