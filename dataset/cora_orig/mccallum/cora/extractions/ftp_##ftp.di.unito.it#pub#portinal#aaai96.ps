Abstract: The present paper describes the empirical evaluation of a linear algebra approach to model-based diagnosis, in case the behavioral model of the device under examination is described through a Petri net model. In particular, we show that algebraic analysis based on P-invariants of the net model, can significantly improve the performance of a model-based diagnostic system, while keeping the integrity of a general framework defined from a formal logical theory. A system called In-vads is described and experimental results, performed on a car fault domain and involving the comparison of different implementations of P-invariant based diagnosis, are then discussed.

Reference-contexts: This means that the problem of finding the solutions to a diagnostic problem can be re-formulated as a reacha-bility problem on the net model; this can classically be tackled in two different ways, with a reachability graph approach (as shown in <ref> (Anglano & Portinale 1994) </ref>) or with an algebraic (invariant-based) approach. The aim of this paper is to concentrate on invariant analysis and to discuss the performance of a diagnostic algorithm based on such a principle, with respect to a classical approach based on symbolic manipulation. <p> This clearly adds more interest to the net invariant approach to diagnosis, by also taking into account the fact that its complementary approach (i.e. the diagnosis based on reachabil-ity graph analysis) has been shown to be very adequate to a parallel implementation <ref> (Anglano & Porti-nale 1994) </ref>. Future works are planned in order to compare P-invariant diagnosis also with this approach.

Reference-contexts: Since both purely consistency based and purely ab-ductive approaches suffer from some drawbacks, some effort has been done in order to combine them (Poole 1989; Console & Torasso 1991). In the present paper, we will refer to the framework defined in <ref> (Console & Torasso 1991) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We assume that M is represented by a set of definite clauses. This allows us to focus on a simple kind of model that is however representationally adequate for significant classes of behavioral models (see <ref> (Console et al. 1993) </ref>). If OBS is the set of current observations, the set + is in general a subset of OBS ( + OBS), while = fm (x)=m (y) 2 OBS; x 6= yg. <p> Logical and P-invariant Diagnosis Comparison To test the performance of a P-invariant diagnostic algorithm against a classical logical approach, we chose to compare the Invads system using the ADD strategy with an abductive diagnostic system called Aid <ref> (Console et al. 1993) </ref>. The reasons for such a direct comparison are twofold: 1. both systems rely on the same formal framework of reference we previously discussed; 2. both systems share the same implementation en-vironment (a SICStus prolog implementation for SUN sparc stations).

Reference-contexts: From these considerations, we can devise a P-invariant based diagnostic algorithm: after having computed the minimal supports of P-invariants, (efficient algorithms exist for this task <ref> (Martinez & Silva 1982) </ref>) those related to predictions corresponding to places in P are eliminated by taking into account the fact that if ^ and ^ 0 are two sets of ground atoms such that ^ ^ 0 , if ^ ` ff then ^ 0 ` ff; at the same

Reference-contexts: Introduction In some recent papers (Portinale 1993), we have shown that Petri nets (PNs) <ref> (Murata 1989) </ref> can be fruitfully employed to face the problem of model-based diagnosis. This is accomplished by taking into account a formal logical framework of reference, defining classical notions (from the AI point of view) concerning the characterization of a diagnostic problem. <p> It is well known that any invariant can be obtained as a linear combination of invariants having minimal (with respect to set inclusion) supports <ref> (Murata 1989) </ref>. Petri nets and Model-based Diagnosis Model-based diagnosis deals with the problem of determining the explanation of the abnormal behavior of a given device, by reasoning on a model (usually a behavioral model) of such a device (Hamscher, Console, & de Kleer 1992). <p> By definition, P-invariants of a net N = hP; T; F i correspond to T-invariants of its dual net N D = hT; P; F i. The following lemma has been proved in <ref> (Peterka & Murata 1989) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The BPN model is not proposed as a direct tool of diagnostic knowledge representation, but rather as an analysis formalism that can be derived from other forms of knowledge representation, like for instance causal networks as described in <ref> (Portinale 1992) </ref>. We concentrated on P-invariant reachability analysis, representing the starting point for the definition of an innovative approach to model-based diagnosis. We tested the different implementation of the approach on a car engine fault domain, by getting an encouraging comparison with a classical logical approach to diagnosis.

Reference-contexts: Introduction In some recent papers <ref> (Portinale 1993) </ref>, we have shown that Petri nets (PNs) (Murata 1989) can be fruitfully employed to face the problem of model-based diagnosis. <p> This would allows us to get the equivalent of the kernel diagnoses defined in (de Kleer, Mackworth, & Reiter 1992) 1 . In <ref> (Portinale 1993) </ref> a simple Petri net model, called Behavioral Petri Net (BPN), has been introduced, in order to capture the representational issues discussed above. <p> They are actually "macro-transitions" that can be obtained by means of a set of classical transitions (see <ref> (Portinale 1993) </ref>). It can be shown that a BPN models the same kind of knowledge of a hierarchical definite logic program. <p> Definition 5 An initial marking of a BPN is a safe marking 0 such that 0 (p) = 1 ! * p = ;. A marked BPN is always considered with respect to a marking reachable from an initial marking. As shown in <ref> (Portinale 1993) </ref>, every marked BPN is safe and in a marked BPN there is a unique marking, called the final marking, from which no transition can fire. <p> The formal connection between logic-based and BPN-based characterizations is established by means of the following theorem whose proof can be found in <ref> (Portinale 1993) </ref>: Theorem 1 Given a logic-based diagnostic problem DP = hM; H; CXT; h + ; ii, let N M be the BPN corresponding to M and CXT E be the marking corresponding to E [ CXT (E H); if (N M ; CXT 9 2 R (N M ; <p> The following theorem provides us with an operational notion of diagnosis in a BPN framework (see <ref> (Portinale 1993) </ref> for the proof): Theorem 2 A candidate diagnosis 0 is a solution to BPN-DP= hN M ; P H ; P C ; hP + ; P ii (i.e. is a diagnosis) if and only if the final marking of (N M ; 0 [ C ) covers P
