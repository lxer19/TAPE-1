Abstract: We present an actor language which is an extension of a simple functional language, and provide an operational semantics for this extension. Actor configurations represent open distributed systems, by which we mean that the specification of an actor system explicitly takes into account the interface with external components. We study the composability of such systems. We define and study various notions of testing equivalence on actor expressions and configurations. The model we develop provides fairness. An important result is that the three forms of equivalence, namely, convex, must, and may equivalences, collapse to two in the presence of fairness. We further develop methods for proving laws of equivalence and provide example proofs to illustrate our methodology.

Reference-contexts: A structured operational semantics and type inference system for a small kernel language contained in CML is described in (Reppy, 1991) and a type safety theorem is proved. An equational calculus is given for a sequential core of Obliq <ref> (Abadi and Cardelli, 1994) </ref>. The semantics of Pict is given by expansion into the pi-calculus core, but no effort has been made so far to develop the induced equational theory.

Reference-contexts: The work did not develop a theory of actor systems specifically, no notion of equivalence of actor systems was defined. The semantic model of our actor language builds on that of <ref> (Agha, 1986) </ref> which defined a simple transition system for actors, and developed a notion of configurations, receptionists and external actors. <p> A configuration can be thought of as representing a global snapshot of an actor system with respect to some idealized observer <ref> (Agha, 1986) </ref>. It contains a collection of actors, messages, external actor names, and receptionist names. The sets of receptionists and external actors are the interface of an actor configuration to its environment. They specify what actors are visible and what actor connections must be provided for the configuration to function.

Reference-contexts: Actor Computation 7 It has also provided a basis for dozens of other projects (Agha et al., 1989a; Agha et al., 1991; Agha et al., 1993b). Some of the more recent research on actors has focused on coordination structures and meta-architectures <ref> (Agha et al., 1993a) </ref>. Yonezawa has developed the ABCL family (Yonezawa, 1990) of actor languages. <p> In this paper we focus on developing equational laws for our basic actor language latter and leave to future work the study of richer actor language features; see <ref> (Agha et al., 1993a) </ref> for an extensive repertoire of communication and protocol primitives for actors. The Facile project is perhaps the closest in spirit to our overall effort.

Reference-contexts: Basic process algebra equations, along with a few simple functional laws, are established using bisimulations. The authors point out that establishing expression equivalence using bisimulations is much more complicated than establishing process algebra equations. An early version of the actor semantics presented in this paper appeared in <ref> (Agha et al., 1992) </ref>. There we defined a notion of operational bisimulation that incorporated fairness. Operational bisimulations were intended to serve as tools for establishing observational equivalence, not as equivalence relations per se.

Reference-contexts: Process algebras typcially take synchronous communication as primitive instead of asynchronous communication ((Honda and Tokoro, 1991) defines a variant of the -calculus with asynchronous communication). Synchronous communication can be simulated with asynchronous primitives <ref> (Amadio, 1994) </ref> and vice-versa, and it is probably the case that both will be required in any realistic concurrent programming language. In standard process algebra theory, processes can be dynamically created, but they are not first class entities that can be directly manipulated.

Reference-contexts: There have been a number of languages developed using the approach we follow in this paper| combining concurrency primitives with a functional language. These languages include Amber (Cardelli, 1986), Facile (Giacalone et al., 1989; Prasad et al., 1990; Thomsen et al., 1992), CML (Reppy, 1991), Erlang <ref> (Armstrong et al., 1993) </ref>, Obliq (Cardelli, 1994), and Pict (Pierce and Turner, 1994). Erlang and Obliq are object based languages (Er-lang is essentially an actor language) while Facile, CML, and Pict have process algebra concurrency primitives. Of these only CML and Erlang require fairness.

Reference-contexts: In (Hewitt and Atkinson, 1979), the concept of serializer is described: a serial-izer localizes conditions for resumption of waiting processes and thus improves on monitors which require explicit signaling of dormant processes. A related notion, namely, that of guardians, was defined in <ref> (Attardi and Hewitt, 1978) </ref>. A guardian regulates the use of shared resources, scheduling their access and providing protection and "recovery" boundaries. Guardians thus explicitly incorporated the notion of state. Lieberman implemented an actor language, Act1, incorporating guardians, serializers, and `rock bottom' actors which is best described in (Lieberman, 1987).

Reference-contexts: Irene Greif (Greif, 1975) developed an abstract model of actors in terms of event diagrams which recorded local events at each actor and the causal relations between events. Baker and Hewitt <ref> (Baker and Hewitt, 1977) </ref> then formalized a set of axioms for concurrent computation which stated properties that events in actor systems must obey in order to prevent causality violations. <p> Guardians thus explicitly incorporated the notion of state. Lieberman implemented an actor language, Act1, incorporating guardians, serializers, and `rock bottom' actors which is best described in (Lieberman, 1987). Will Clinger (Clinger, 1981) developed a semantics of actor systems, showing the consistency of axioms proposed in <ref> (Baker and Hewitt, 1977) </ref>. A key accomplishment of Clinger's work was to show that a powerdomain semantics could be developed despite the fact that the underlying domain is incomplete due to fairness.

Reference-contexts: Reduction contexts identify the subexpression of an expression that is to be evaluated next, they correspond to the standard reduction strategy (left-first, call-by-value) of (Plotkin, 1975) and were first introduced in <ref> (Felleisen and Friedman, 1986) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In (Hewitt et al., 1973), the notion of actors was closer to that of an agent in Distributed Artificial Intelligence: actors have intentions, resources, contain message monitors and a scheduler. Irene Greif <ref> (Greif, 1975) </ref> developed an abstract model of actors in terms of event diagrams which recorded local events at each actor and the causal relations between events.

Reference-contexts: The actor model was originally proposed by Hewitt and the meaning of the term has evolved over time in the work of Hewitt and associates. We briefly describe the history of actor research, necessarily omitting some of the significant work. In his early work on planner <ref> (Hewitt, 1971) </ref>, Hewitt used the term actor to describe active entities which, unlike functions, went around looking for patterns to match in order to trigger activity.
