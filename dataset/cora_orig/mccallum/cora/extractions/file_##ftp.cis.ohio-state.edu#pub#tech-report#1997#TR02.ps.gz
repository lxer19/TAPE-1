Abstract: The Available Bit Rate (ABR) service has been developed to support data applications over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The ABR service uses a closed-loop rate-based traffic management framework where the network divides available bandwidth among contending sources. The ATM Forum then worked on incorporating open-loop control capabilities to make the ABR service robust to temporary network failures and source inactivity periods. One of the problems addressed was whether rate allocations of sources should be taken away if sources do not use them. The proposed solutions, popularly known as the Use-It-or-Lose-It (UILI) policies, have had significant impact on the ABR service capabilities. In this paper we survey the design, development, the final shape of these policies and their impact on the ABR service.

Reference-contexts: The ABR service class has built-in traffic management mechanisms which rapidly allocate the ABR bandwidth among active sources. Applications using this service class expect guarantees regarding cell loss, but can control their data rate dynamically as demanded by the network <ref> [1] </ref>. The ABR service is an also an efficient way of carrying data traffic over an ATM backbone network. The UBR service class, on the other hand, does not have any standard traffic management support and does not give any quality of service (QoS) guarantees to applications.

Reference-contexts: An idle source becoming active again had to precede its data cells with an RM cell. This would allow the RM cell to probe the network and bring the feedback faster than waiting for the normal turn of the RM cell. Barnhart <ref> [2] </ref> observed that the specification had the following problems: 4 * Idle Period Definition: As mentioned above, as source is considered idle if it does not send an RM cell for 100ms . <p> Some proposals also ignore the next feedback from the switch (if the feedback requests a rate increase) to prevent the ACR reduction to be overridden by a network feedback. 5.1 February 1995 Proposals Based on Barhart's contribution <ref> [2] </ref>, the ABR source specification in February 1995 read as follows: "1. The source shall send an RM-cell for every Nrm cells transmitted, and also at least every 100ms if data is being transmitted.

Reference-contexts: We discuss the effect of this rule and its parameters elsewhere [26]. 5.2.2 ACR Reduction Function The proposed reduction function was also found to be unsatisfactory. Barnhart <ref> [3] </ref> observed that the February 1995 reduction function had a very sharp slope and would reduce ACR too fast. In fact, an idle period of 1.4ms can force the same decrease as backward RM (BRM) cells with CI=1 (actual network congestion) can force in 14ms.

Reference-contexts: A source may be continuously receiving BRM cells, but still not using its ACR allocation (an ACR retaining source). Hence, it was decided to make the test dependent on the time since the last RM was sent, and independent of when a BRM is received. 7 Roberts <ref> [4] </ref> noted that the purpose of the February 1995 test depending upon the last BRM received was not ACR retention, but to protect the network when no feedback (RM cell) returns to the source. He argued that this functionality deserved a separate SES rule, and associated parameters.

Reference-contexts: cell transmission interval (1/ACR), down to ICR. b. if ACR &lt;= ICR then the source shall decrease its ACR by at least ACR*Nrm/RDF, down to MCR. 8 c. the source shall not increase its rate upon the reception of the next RM cell." 5.3 May and June 1995 proposals Kenny <ref> [5] </ref> argued that item 5b. of the April 95 SES specification be eliminated to avoid its side effects: 5.3.1 Idle Sources vs Low Rate Sources First, it discriminates against sources which are source-bottlenecked, compared to sources which are idle. <p> However, in practice the effect of item c. was mixed, i.e., its inclusion does reduce ACR Retention from 6:1 to 3:1 in many experiments <ref> [5] </ref>. 9 5.3.3 A New ACR Reduction Formula The ACR reduction formula was again modified based on the proposal by Kenny et al [6] for simpler implementation.

Reference-contexts: However, in practice the effect of item c. was mixed, i.e., its inclusion does reduce ACR Retention from 6:1 to 3:1 in many experiments [5]. 9 5.3.3 A New ACR Reduction Formula The ACR reduction formula was again modified based on the proposal by Kenny et al <ref> [6] </ref> for simpler implementation. Kenny et al observe that, while the April reduction formula has no multiply operations, it is difficult to implement, inconsistent with other reduction formulas, and is inflexibly tied to the RDF parameter. Finding 1/ACR requires reciprocation which is difficult.

Reference-contexts: The two parts are called "rule 5a" and "rule 5b" respectively. 6 Problems and Side Effects of Early Proposals In August 1995, Anna Charny et al <ref> [7] </ref> pointed out certain undesirable side effects of the July 1995 UILI proposal. In particular, sources experience performance degradation in the transient phase when they increase from low ACR to high ACR. <p> In effect a source starting from a low ICR may never send at a rate higher than ICR. 6.2 Bursty and RPC Traffic Performance In fact, it was observed in simulations of Charny et al <ref> [7] </ref> that bursty traffic having low ICR experienced a long term performance degradation. The effective rate of transmission fluctuates between a low and a high value. The rule 5b which prevents the increase of the source rate even though the network may have bandwidth available.

Reference-contexts: The group, however, decided to use linear curves with more aggressive slopes than ICR. Specifically, it decided to use multiples of PCR/RDF, where the multiplying factor is a parameter called TDFF (signalled version of TDF). Further, as suggested in <ref> [8] </ref>, the UILI rule applies as long as ACR is greater than ICR, and that the ACR should not be decreased below ICR. 5.3.4 The Updated UILI Policy Incorporating the aforementioned changes, the specification in August read as follows: "5. <p> Hence, it was decided to introduce a PNI (Prohibit No Increase) bit, which when set, turns off rule 5b selectively or rule 5 completely (if TDF is also zero). The performance degradation due to RPC (ping-pong) type traffic was independently observed by <ref> [8] </ref>. These authors pointed out that such applications may not want their rates to be decreased or reset to ICR after every idle period. They also suggested that UILI be performed by the switch and leave the source-based UILI optional.

Reference-contexts: be due to the fact that the decrease function was proportional to T resulting in large ACR decreases after an ACR increase, leading to ramp-up delays. 6.3 The Rescheduling Option The problem of large T is alleviated by the rescheduling option originally introduced in the context of low rate sources <ref> [9] </ref>. This option allows data cells to be scheduled as soon as possible when the rate is increased, instead of waiting for the scheduling slot determined at the old (low) rate. The time variable T is reduced by at most one inter cell time at the old rate.

Reference-contexts: The user-level metric is the burst response time. We use the model described in the following section to generate short, medium and long bursts, and isolate the behavior of UILI for study. 8.2.1 Closed Loop Bursty Traffic Model Jain et al <ref> [10] </ref> define a new "closed loop" bursty traffic model as shown in Figure 13. The model consists of cycles of request-response traffic. In each cycle a source application sends a set of requests and receives a set of responses from the destination application.

Reference-contexts: We henceforth use the words ACR retention and ACR promotion (preferring the former) interchangeably to mean that the source rate is smaller than ACR. ACR allocation remains constant. At time t 0 , the source rate rises to ACR and the network queues correspondingly rise. Jain et al <ref> [14] </ref> note that the maximum queue size is (ACR SourceRate) fl F eedbackdelay fl (#sources 1). Each of the three factors (ACR-SourceRate, Feedback delay, number of sources) can be high and increase the maximum queue size. <p> An idle source differs from a source-bottlenecked source in that the former does not send RM cells or receive feedback, whereas the latter sends data and RM cells, but at a rate smaller than the allocated ACR. Jain et al <ref> [14] </ref> later observe that a source may be bottlenecked at the SES because there are multiple source sharing sharing the same outgoing link from the SES. <p> These problems were addressed in the new set of proposals in December 1995 when the issue was voted upon to arrive at a final decision. 7 December 1995 Proposals There were three main proposals in December 1995: the time-based proposal [11, 12, 13], the count-based proposal <ref> [14] </ref>, and the switch-based proposal [15]. The first time-based and the count-based proposals were later combined into one joint proposal. The ATM Forum voted between the switch-based proposal and the joint source-based proposal. 7.1 Outstanding UILI issues The following were the outstanding issues in UILI in December. <p> multiplicative (ACR TOF*S) or additive (ACR S + headroom) ? Is a separate headroom parameter necessary (to avoid depending on ICR) ? * Can UILI be done effectively in the switch ? * Under what circumstances is UILI unnecessary or harmful ? 7.2 Count-Based UILI Proposal The count-based UILI proposal <ref> [14] </ref> solved a large subset of these problems and presented results of an extensive study on bursty traffic behavior. 7.2.1 Count vs Time First, the count-based proposal removes the dependency of the ACR reduction function on the time factor, T, which is the time since the last FRM is sent.

Reference-contexts: Older data networks did not have to deal with capacity being variable since they did not support multiple service classes. Further, transmission speeds were lower in such networks and a longer delay. ABR switch algorithms like ERICA and ERICA+ <ref> [22] </ref> have been developed which quickly allocate the available capacity among the active sources. * The ABR sources' demand may be constant or highly variable. <p> The count-based UILI proposal 5. The time-based UILI proposal The configuration is a network consisting of five ABR sources (Figure 6) going through two switches to corresponding destinations. All simulation results use ERICA switch algorithm <ref> [22] </ref>. All links are 155 Mbps and 1000 km long. All VCs are bidirectional, that is, D1, D2, through D5 are also sending traffic to S1, S2 through S5. <p> The other source parameters are chosen to maximize ACR and disable the effects of other source rules: ICR = 10Mbps TDF = 1/8 TCR = 10 cells/sec TRM = 100ms CDF = 0 to disable SES Rule 6 For the time-based implementation, The switch algorithm used is ERICA <ref> [22] </ref>. It has two parameters, the target utilization which is set to 90%, and the averaging interval which is set to the minimum of a timeout value, 1ms and the time to receive 100 ABR cells. 8.2.3 Small Bursts Small bursts are seen in LANE traffic.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction ATM networks provide five classes of service <ref> [23] </ref>: constant bit rate (CBR), real-time variable bit rate (VBR-rt), non real-time variable bit rate (VBR-nrt), available bit rate (ABR), and unspecified bit rate (UBR). The VBR and CBR classes are higher priority classes used to transport real-time or high quality audio and video data. <p> The count based performance can be improved by using a leaky bucket or GCRA <ref> [23] </ref> type of burst tolerance mechanism where small bursts can be sent at link rate irrespective of ACR or ICR. Other alternatives include choosing a small TDF or a larger ICR. An ICR of 10Mbps allows LANE traffic (the source of small bursts) to go through at full speed.

Reference-contexts: This is more realistic than an "open loop" model where bursts are generated at a fixed rate regardless of the congestion in the network. The packet train model <ref> [25] </ref> used previously to model bursty behaviour is an open loop model. This model has the source sending out cars (having back to back packets) with an inter-car time and trains having an inter-train time. But, the source does not wait for any response from the destination.

Reference-contexts: For example, the switch could specify a parameter, (later) called Transient Buffer Exposure (TBE) which limits how many cells an idle source could send at a high rate after it became active. We discuss the effect of this rule and its parameters elsewhere <ref> [26] </ref>. 5.2.2 ACR Reduction Function The proposed reduction function was also found to be unsatisfactory. Barnhart [3] observed that the February 1995 reduction function had a very sharp slope and would reduce ACR too fast.
