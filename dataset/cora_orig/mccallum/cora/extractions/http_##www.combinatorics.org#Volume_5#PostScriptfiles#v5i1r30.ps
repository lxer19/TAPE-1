Abstract: A bivariate symmetric backwards recursion is of the form d[m; n] = w 0 (d[m 1; n]+d[m; n1])+! 1 (d[mr 1 ; ns 1 ]+d[ms 1 ; nr 1 ])+ +! k (d[mr k ; ns k ] + d[m s k ; n r k ]) where ! 0 ; : : :! k are weights, r 1 ; : : :r k and s 1 ; : : :s k are positive integers. We prove three theorems about solving symmetric backwards recursions restricted to the diagonal band x + u &lt; y &lt; x l. With a solution we mean a formula that expresses d[m; n] as a sum of differences of recursions without the band restriction. Depending on the application, the boundary conditions can take different forms. The three theorems solve the following cases: d[x + u; x] = 0 for all x 0, and d[x l; x] = 0 for all x l (applies to the exact distribution of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample statistic), d[x + u; x] = 0 for all x 0, and d[x l + 1; x] = d[x l + 1; x 1] for x l (ordinary lattice paths with weighted left turns), and d[y; y u + 1] = d[y 1; y u + 1] for all y u and d[x l + 1; x] = d[x l + 1; x 1] for x l. The first theorem is a general form of what is commonly known as repeated application of the Reflection Principle. The second and third theorem are new; we apply them to lattice paths which in addition to the usual North and East steps also make two hook moves, East-North-North and North-East-East. Hook moves differ from knight moves (covered by the first theorem) by being blocked by any piece of the barrier they encounter along their three part move.

Reference-contexts: A generalized ballot path with steps !; " and % (king moves) is also called a Schroder path [14], [16]. The number of ordinary paths (10) above (or below) a diagonal boundary is usually attributed to Andre <ref> [1] </ref>. Takacs [17] gives an excellent review of the history of lattice path counting. Andre does not use the Reflection Principle in his paper. The principle appears to be much older, and is sometimes referred to as d'Alembert's Reflection Principle in Physics. <p> a a a * is given by the recurrence relation (f (1; 1); (1; 2); (2; 1)g ; (t 0 ; ; -; -)) + -(K [m 1; n 2] + K [m 2; n 1]) and the initial conditions K [0; n] = K [m; 0] = 1, K <ref> [1; n] </ref> = K [m; 1] = 0 for nonnegative integers m and n. We have = 3 and d row = 2. <p> is given by the recurrence relation (f (1; 1); (1; 2); (2; 1)g ; (t 0 ; ; -; -)) + -(K [m 1; n 2] + K [m 2; n 1]) and the initial conditions K [0; n] = K [m; 0] = 1, K [1; n] = K <ref> [m; 1] </ref> = 0 for nonnegative integers m and n. We have = 3 and d row = 2. <p> Let m 0. If n &lt; 1 then t [m + c + 1; n + 1] and t [m + c; n + 1] are both zero, and so is a [m; n]. If n = 1 then a <ref> [m; 1] </ref> = t [m + c + 1; 0] t [m + c; 0] = 0: Lemma 11 Suppose, [a] and [b] are (r; t )-boards with initial conditions a [m n ; n] = ff n and b [m n+c ; n] = fi n , where c and <p> 71 2 1 2 0 6 9 51 0 1 2 2 14 : : : : : : n! 0 1 2 3 4 5 Neither row nor column polynomials Columns are polynomials of degree n In both tables we start with d [m; 0] = 1, and d <ref> [m; 1] </ref> = 0 for m 0. In the first table we let d [1; n] = 1 and d [1; n] = 0 for n 0, which gives us the "unrestricted" vizier+knight moves. <p> In the first table we let d <ref> [1; n] </ref> = 1 and d [1; n] = 0 for n 0, which gives us the "unrestricted" vizier+knight moves. The n-th column in that table is obviously not obtainable in the form d [m; n] = d n (m), where d n is a polynomial of degree n. <p> In the first table we let d <ref> [1; n] </ref> = 1 and d [1; n] = 0 for n 0, which gives us the "unrestricted" vizier+knight moves. The n-th column in that table is obviously not obtainable in the form d [m; n] = d n (m), where d n is a polynomial of degree n. <p> In order for the column polynomials to appear we have to extend the initial conditions d [m; 0] = 1, and d <ref> [m; 1] </ref> = 0 to negative values of m. A formula for the entries in the left table can be found by elementary combinatorial arguments.
