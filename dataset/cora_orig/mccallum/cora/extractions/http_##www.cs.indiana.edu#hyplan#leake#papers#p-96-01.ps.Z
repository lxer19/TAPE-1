Abstract: A father taking his two-year-old son on a walk reaches an intersection and asks where they should turn. The child picks a direction, the direction they turned in at that intersection the day before to go to the supermarket. The child explains: "I have a memory: Buy donut." Reasoning is often modeled as a process that draws conclusions by chaining together generalized rules, starting from scratch. Case-based reasoning (CBR) takes a very different view. In CBR, the primary knowledge source is not generalized rules but a memory of stored cases recording specific prior episodes. In CBR, new solutions are generated not by chaining, but by retrieving the most relevant cases from memory and adapting them to fit new situations. Thus in CBR, reasoning is based on remembering. As the passages starting this section illustrate, remindings facilitate human reasoning in many contexts and for many tasks, ranging from children's simple reasoning to expert decision-making. Much of the original inspiration for the CBR approach came from the role of remindings in human reasoning (Schank 1982). The CBR approach is based on two tenets about the nature of the world. The first tenet is that the world is regular: similar problems have similar solutions. Consequently, solutions for similar prior problems are a useful starting point for new problem-solving. The second tenet is that the types of problems an agent encounters tend to recur. Consequently,

Reference-contexts: Such systems provide a resource for human help desk employees, who can call upon an automated case library to present similar prior questions and answers. Case-based help desk systems can provide significant performance improvements with rapid development time. Compaq's SMART system <ref> (Acorn & Walden 1992) </ref>, a case-based call tracking and problem resolution system that aids customer service representatives at a central help line, was built in six months and improved productivity sufficiently to pay for itself within a year.

Reference-contexts: As the field has matured, increased attention has been given to more quantitative evaluations of CBR systems and methods. Many case studies of evaluation of CBR systems and discussions of how to perform that evaluation are available in the proceedings of the 1994 AAAI Workshop on Case-Based Reasoning <ref> (Aha 1994) </ref>. The chapters in this volume substantiate approaches with a mixture of qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Reference-contexts: CBR is similar to EBG in allowing single-example learning. However, CBR does not generalize cases at storage time. Instead, CBR adapts cases when adaptation is needed to solve a new problem. Thus CBR can be viewed as a form of lazy learning <ref> (e.g., Aha, 1996) </ref>. (Because CBR does generalize indices (Hammond 1989a), ungeneralized cases can still be retrieved to deal with novel problems.) Waiting to adapt cases avoids expending effort unless it is certain that the effort will help solve an actual problem.

Reference-contexts: The CBR approach also contrasts with knowledge-poor inductive learning methods because it emphasizes the semantics of a domain, through similarity and retrieval criteria and case adaptation knowledge. Instance-based learning (IBL), also called case-based learning, is an inductive learning method closely related to CBR. Rather than forming generalizations, IBL algorithms <ref> (Aha, 12 Kibler, & Albert 1991) </ref> store previously-categorized episodes and use them to classify new inputs by assigning the same classification that was assigned to the most similar previous case (or cases).

Reference-contexts: In CBR, whether a particular case should be retrieved depends not only on the case itself, but whether there are better competitors. Despite these differences, databases can provide useful foundations for CBR memories and CBR can have useful synergies with information retrieval <ref> (e.g., Anick & Simoudis, 1993) </ref>. For example, Kitano and Shimazu (Chapter 13) advocate the use of relational database management systems, combined with supplementary mechanisms to allow flexible query specification and 11 partial matching during retrieval, to manage the case libraries for large-scale corporate CBR applications.

Reference-contexts: new situations; problem-solving CBR uses prior cases to suggest solutions that might apply to new circumstances. 4 3.1 Case-based interpretation In interpretive CBR, the reasoner's goal is to form a judgment about or classification of a new situation, by comparing and contrasting it with cases that have already been classified <ref> (e.g., Ashley & Rissland, 1987) </ref>. For example, interpretive CBR plays a fundamental role in interpreting legal concepts and applying laws in the American legal system (e.g., Ashley, 1990; Bain, 1986; Branting, 1991; Cuthill, 1992; Sanders, 1994).

Reference-contexts: Integrated systems: More balanced combinations of CBR with other reasoning methods are also being investigated. For example, the INRECA project focuses on combining CBR and inductive learning techniques to perform diagnosis <ref> (Auriol et al. 1995) </ref>. Likewise, case-based and rule-based reasoning may be combined in many ways.

Reference-contexts: Interpretive CBR is also important for tasks such as diagnosis; a problem can be diagnosed by comparing and contrasting the current symptoms to those in previous cases to determine the best diagnosis <ref> (e.g., Bareiss, 1989) </ref>. In its simplest form, interpretive CBR involves four steps. First, the reasoner must perform situation assessment (Kolodner 1993; Owens 1991), to determine which features of the current situation are really relevant.

Reference-contexts: An alternative is a very specific version of the rule, such as add the step "rotate radiation sources" to remove harmful side-effect "excess radiation" <ref> (Berger & Hammond 1991) </ref>. Such rules can be applied effectively, but hand 20 building such rules in advance requires intimate knowledge of a domain. In addition, an enormous number of rules may be needed, especially in systems that reason about multiple tasks and domains.

Reference-contexts: Because CBR systems retrieve complete solutions, they offer an "anytime" ability to produce a first-pass solution rapidly, and then to refine it if the time constraints of the surrounding system allow additional processing to be done <ref> (Dean & Boddy 1988) </ref>. Learning from actual processing episodes also automatically tailors the output of the intelligent component towards precisely what the surrounding system needs. 5.4 Case adaptation A final research challenge and opportunity centers on one of the basic steps of CBR: case adaptation.

Reference-contexts: An example of a combined system that uses other methods to support CBR is the case-based design system JULIA (Hinrichs 1992), which uses supporting systems such as a constraint poster (Stefik 1981) and a reason maintenance system <ref> (Doyle 1979) </ref> to support a fundamentally case-based design process. Other CBR systems fall back on rule-based reasoning as a backup to CBR, using rules when no relevant cases are available (e.g., Goel, et al., 1994; Koton, 1988).

Reference-contexts: First, some research on analogy takes a more extensive view, focusing not only on mapping but also seriously addressing related issues such as retrieval <ref> (e.g., Gentner & Forbus, 1991) </ref>. Second, despite the breakdown of steps in this description of CBR, the steps of the CBR process are not independent. Considering them together provides an advantage over studying them individually, because their relationships can be exploited to facilitate and constrain processing in each one.

Reference-contexts: The task failure prompts the system to try to learn a successful plan; the expectation failure prompts the system to learn how to anticipate similar problems in the future, in order to avoid them <ref> (e.g., Hammond, 1989a) </ref>. When a planner generates a plan that is successful even beyond expectations, there is no task failure, but there is still an expectation failure, prompting learning about how to anticipate and perhaps harness the unexpected good effects. In CBR systems, failures can trigger multiple types of learning. <p> However, CBR does not generalize cases at storage time. Instead, CBR adapts cases when adaptation is needed to solve a new problem. Thus CBR can be viewed as a form of lazy learning (e.g., Aha, 1996). (Because CBR does generalize indices <ref> (Hammond 1989a) </ref>, ungeneralized cases can still be retrieved to deal with novel problems.) Waiting to adapt cases avoids expending effort unless it is certain that the effort will help solve an actual problem. <p> For example, the adaptation rule add a step to remove harmful side-effect has been proposed to repair plans with bad side-effects in case-based planning <ref> (Hammond 1989a) </ref>. This rule is widely applicable|it applies to any plan|but it gives no guidance about how to find the right step to add in order to mitigate a given side-effect.

Reference-contexts: Although other sources of knowledge and other reasoning processes may be used, their role is to support the CBR process (Kolodner, Chapter 16). An example of a combined system that uses other methods to support CBR is the case-based design system JULIA <ref> (Hinrichs 1992) </ref>, which uses supporting systems such as a constraint poster (Stefik 1981) and a reason maintenance system (Doyle 1979) to support a fundamentally case-based design process.

Reference-contexts: In medical reasoning, for example, anecdotes about specific cases go beyond codified knowledge, serving as "the as-yet-unorganized evidence at the forefront of clinical medicine" <ref> (Hunter 1986) </ref>. 5. User acceptance: A key problem in deploying successful AI systems is user acceptance: no system is useful unless its users accept its results. To trust the system's conclusions, a user may need to be convinced that they are derived in a reasonable way.

Reference-contexts: software quality control advisory system with a case library of over 25,000 cases; Cassiopee, a case-based diagnostic aid for jet engines, uses 16,000 cases for its diagnosis process (Goodall 1995); and ALFA, a case-based system for power plant load forecasting, is in operation with a case library of 87,000 cases <ref> (Jabbour et al. 1988) </ref>. These and other examples support that current technology is sufficient for CBR to be viable with large case bases. However, as Kolodner points out in Chapter 16, it is important to note that large case bases are not necessarily required by CBR.

Reference-contexts: IBL systems forgo complex indexing, use feature-value representations, and do not address case adaptation, but they nevertheless appear very promising for certain applications (see Riesbeck, Chapter 17). They have also attracted attention as a form of CBR that is amenable to formal analysis <ref> (e.g., Jantke, 1992) </ref>. Explanation-based generalization: Explanation-based generalization (EBG) uses rules about a domain to explain why a training example has particular properties, and uses the explanation to guide generalization. The generalization is then stored for future use (DeJong & Mooney 1986; Mitchell, Keller, & Kedar-Cabelli 1986).

Reference-contexts: cases not by the match between their features but instead by whether their features can be adapted to match (Borner 1994; Leake 1992a; 1995b). * Preparing for adaptation at storage time CBR practitioners have long recognized the need for case representations to provide the information needed to facilitate future adaptation <ref> (e.g., Kass & Leake, 1988) </ref>. This basic tenet for designing representations can be taken further, however, to guide preprocessing of specific cases at storage time in order to facilitate future adaptation.

Reference-contexts: For example, the SWALE system, which uses a case-based method to build explanations for story understanding, stores its explanations without generalization, and generalizes them only if generalization is needed to subsume future situations. Even then, generalization is only done to the extent needed to subsume them <ref> (e.g., Kass, Leake, & Owens, 1986) </ref>. Another important difference between CBR and EBG is that adaptation is often much more flexible than explanation-based generalization. Adaptation can include operations other than generalization, such as specialization and substitution, and may involve modifications that are not guaranteed to be correct.

Reference-contexts: For example, in case-based educational systems whose cases are video clips, the case content is simply not accessible. Nevertheless, difficulties with case adaptation have led many CBR systems to simply dispense with adaptation, replacing the retrieve-evaluate-adapt cycle with retrieve and propose systems <ref> (e.g., Kolodner, 1991) </ref>. Such systems exploit the memory processes developed in CBR research, while relying on a human user to adapt and evaluate solutions. <p> It has proven a serious impediment to automatic adaptation. Recognizing that practical retrieval technologies are available, but that the general adaptation problem remains extremely difficult for CBR systems, experts in both CBR research <ref> (e.g., Kolodner, 1991) </ref> and applications (e.g., Barletta; 1994; Mark et al., Chapter 14) agree that the best use of CBR for today's applied systems is as advisory systems that rely on the user to perform evaluation and adaptation.

Reference-contexts: More generally, the computational models developed by CBR can contribute to education by providing concrete suggestions about what makes a good problem, the range of problems that students should solve, and the kinds of resources that should be made available to student learners <ref> (Kolodner, Hmelo, & Narayanan 1996) </ref>. 17 Knowledge navigation: The knowledge access issues that are crucial to CBR will also play a central role in developing "digital libraries" of on-line information.

Reference-contexts: Explanation-based generalization: Explanation-based generalization (EBG) uses rules about a domain to explain why a training example has particular properties, and uses the explanation to guide generalization. The generalization is then stored for future use (DeJong & Mooney 1986; Mitchell, Keller, & Kedar-Cabelli 1986). Chunking <ref> (Laird, Rosenbloom, & Newell 1990) </ref>, which collects traces of problem-solving steps and packages them for reuse, is a similar approach. Unlike inductive generalization, explanation-based generalization can do reliable learning from single examples. CBR is similar to EBG in allowing single-example learning. However, CBR does not generalize cases at storage time.

Reference-contexts: Case evaluation: Like case adaptation, evaluation of the goodness of retrieved cases may be problematic for CBR systems, because evaluating candidate solutions may require considerable domain knowledge and reasoning effort. Although schemes have been developed to do rapid coarse-grained evaluation of some types of cases <ref> (e.g., Leake, 1992b) </ref>, providing 9 the right evaluation knowledge is difficult. An alternative approach is to base evaluation on the cases in the case library itself.

Reference-contexts: However, because case adaptation in CBR is only done in response to the need to solve a specific new problem, and because adaptations are only done to the extent required by the new situation, the process is constrained, and the reasonableness of results can be verified in context <ref> (Leake 1995a) </ref>. 5 Progress and Directions To take stock of the state of CBR, this section looks at progress on general CBR issues, at some particularly noteworthy current task areas, and at work on the area of CBR that is least understood, and consequently the greatest research challenge: case adaptation. 13

Reference-contexts: Research on analogy has focused primarily on analogical mapping; CBR in addition studies related processes that occur both before and after mapping. For example, how to retrieve a source case is a fundamental part of CBR, while models of analogy may assume that source concepts are provided as input <ref> (e.g., Mitchell, 1993) </ref>. Also, after a mapping between old 10 and new situations suggests an analogous solution, CBR adapts that solution to fit the new situation, and stores it for future use.

For example, studies support the importance of remindings of prior examples in learning a computer text editor (Ross 1984), learning programming <ref> (Pirolli & Anderson 1985) </ref>, mathematical problem solving (Faries & Schlossberg 1994; Ross 1984), diagnosis by automobile mechanics (Lan-caster & Kolodner 1987) and physicians (Schmidt, Norman, & Boshuizen 1990), explanation of anomalous events (Read & Cesa 1991), and decision-making under time pressure (Klein & Calderwood 1988; 1989).

Understanding these processes requires developing and testing theories of how humans store, retrieve, and apply prior cases. Observations that people use case-based reasoning have also spurred interest in CBR as 2 an AI technology.

Reference-contexts: With the right way of describing problem, similar problems will have solutions that are similar|i.e., easy to adapt to the new situation. The figure also suggests another benefit of CBR: that multiple types of knowledge can be used to encode equivalent information <ref> (Richter 1995) </ref>. Information is contained not only in 5 the case representation/indexing scheme and case base, but also in the similarity metric and adaptation knowledge, and the information contained by these knowledge sources overlaps.

Reference-contexts: The need for tools to enable an expert to participate directly in the case acquisition and case engineering process has been recognized from the early days of CBR <ref> (e.g., Riesbeck, 1988) </ref>. An important part of current work on large-scale CBR projects is developing tools that manage basic parts of the CBR process (e.g., Kitano & Shimazu, Chapter 13, and Mark et al., Chapter 14).

Reference-contexts: First, failures reveal that learning is needed. Second, failures help focus decisions about what to learn: the needed learning must help avoid future failures. CBR systems learn both from task failures, in which their solutions are unsuccessful, and expectation failures <ref> (Schank 1982) </ref>, in which observed outcomes differ|for better or for worse|from predictions. For example, when a planner generates a plan that is expected to work and doesn't, there are two failures.

Reference-contexts: For example, studies support the importance of remindings of prior examples in learning a computer text editor (Ross 1984), learning programming (Pirolli & Anderson 1985), mathematical problem solving (Faries & Schlossberg 1994; Ross 1984), diagnosis by automobile mechanics (Lan-caster & Kolodner 1987) and physicians <ref> (Schmidt, Norman, & Boshuizen 1990) </ref>, explanation of anomalous events (Read & Cesa 1991), and decision-making under time pressure (Klein & Calderwood 1988; 1989). Understanding these processes requires developing and testing theories of how humans store, retrieve, and apply prior cases.

Reference-contexts: In those domains, the cost of knowledge acquisition for CBR is very low. Mark, Simoudis, & Hinkle (Chapter 14) describe their experience in one such domain, autoclave loading. Other reports corroborate comparatively rapid development times for other CBR applications <ref> (e.g., Simoudis & Miller, 1991) </ref>. Of course, not all domains are natural CBR domains; cases may be unavailable, or may be available but in a hard-to-use form (e.g., cases described with natural language text).

Reference-contexts: Storage: Early CBR systems simply stored each case they generated. New work examines the effects of design decisions about the maximum size of case library (Santamaria & Ram, Chapter 12), as well as how to decide which cases must be stored in order to provide sufficient coverage <ref> (e.g., Smyth & Keane, 1995) </ref>. Some systems also reason about which cases to try to acquire (Hunter 1989; Ram 1991). 4 Relationship to other approaches Questions often arise about how case-based reasoning relates to areas such as memory-based reasoning, analogical reasoning, and other learning methods.

Reference-contexts: An example of a combined system that uses other methods to support CBR is the case-based design system JULIA (Hinrichs 1992), which uses supporting systems such as a constraint poster <ref> (Stefik 1981) </ref> and a reason maintenance system (Doyle 1979) to support a fundamentally case-based design process. Other CBR systems fall back on rule-based reasoning as a backup to CBR, using rules when no relevant cases are available (e.g., Goel, et al., 1994; Koton, 1988).

Reference-contexts: processes have been used as a basis for case-based models of creative explanation (e.g., Kass, 1990; Kass, 1992; Schank, 1986; Schank & Leake, 1986; Schank & Leake, 1989), design and problem-solving (e.g., Bhatta, Goel, & Prabhakar, 1994; Kolodner & Penberthy, 1990; Kolodner, 1994, Wills and Kolodner, Chapter 4), story generation <ref> (Turner 1994) </ref>, and understanding (Moorman & Ram 1994). Case-based aiding systems: Case-based aiding systems use automated case memories to support human reasoners. The case memories provide the experiences that human reasoners may lack, suggesting successful prior solutions and warning of prior failures.

Reference-contexts: Retrieval based on nontraditional types of input information, such as bitmap images and CAD plans, is also being investigated <ref> (Vo 1994) </ref>. As is discussed in Section 5.4, methods are also being developed make retrieval focus on cases that are likely to be easy to adapt. Adaptation: Developing case adaptation criteria is a central open challenge for CBR (e.g., Allemang, 1993; Kolodner, 1991; Leake, 1994b).

Reference-contexts: Although case studies already play a useful role in legal and medical education, students using them generally do not confront the complexity of real episodes and do not have the opportunity to act to execute, evaluate, and revise their solutions <ref> (Williams 1992) </ref>. In Chapter 15, Schank examines the ramifications of CBR for education and argues for a new educational curriculum designed to support case acquisition through learning by doing.
