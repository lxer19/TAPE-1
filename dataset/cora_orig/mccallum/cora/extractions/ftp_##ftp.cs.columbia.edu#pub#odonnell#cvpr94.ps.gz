Abstract: There is increasing interest in the recovery of generalized cylinders (GCs) with curved spines. However, existing formulations of such GCs, for example those based on the Frenet-Serret frame or the tube model, suffer serious drawbacks: discontinuities, a lack of expressive power, "narrowing" in the plane normal to the spine, non-intuitive twisting behavior, and/or off-axis nonorthogonality of their local coordinate systems. We discuss some of the problems associated with the non-orthogonality of the coordinate system based on the Frenet-Serret frame. This non-orthogonality is induced by torsion effects and we show how to correct for it. We then introduce a new model, the extruded GC (EGC) model, which overcomes all the problems mentioned above. For complex axes, the EGC model is also simpler to understand and use than existing models. The EGC model is further extended by including local surface deformations. Recovery of the deformable EGC via a physically-motivated paradigm is demonstrated on pre-segmented data from a human carotid artery.

Reference-contexts: A variant of GCs, straight homogeneous generalized cylinders (SHGCs) have the constraint that their cross-section functions be scaled versions of a reference curve and that their spines be linear.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we present some limitations of the Frenet-Serret based model and formulate an extruded generalized cylinder (EGC) that allows a non-planar spine and overcomes the problems resulting from spine inflection points and spine torsion.

[11] in that we aim to quantify as much global shape as possible by explicitly modeling the spine and the cross-section functions. <p> To keep deformations small, our local deformations manifest themselves after the gross global shape is accounted for by a handful of parameters. This work differs from the work of Terzopoulos & Metaxas <ref> [12] </ref> in that we consider a more general global shape function, an EGC, as opposed to a superellip-soid.

The external forces driving the fitting process were a function of the distance from the datapoints to the closest points on the model.
