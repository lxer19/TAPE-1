Abstract: A probe based approach is used to recognize objects in a cluttered background using an infrared imager. A probe is a simple mathematical function which operates locally on image grey levels and produces an output that is more directly usable by an algorithm. A directional probe image is calculated by taking the difference in grey levels between pixels a set distance apart in a given direction, centered on the probe image pixel. These probe images contain the information necessary for use by an object recognition algorithm in a readily usable, and mathematically describable, form. A parametric statistical image background model which describes the probe images is introduced. The parameters of the probe image model can be readily estimated from the image. Knowledge of these parameters, together with target signatures obtained from Computer Aided Design (CAD) models, allows the likelihood ratio for a given object pose hypothesis versus the background null hypothesis to be written. The generalized likelihood ratio test is used to accept one of the object poses or to choose the null hypothesis. Results of the method applied to a large set of terrain model board images are presented. The support of Rama Chellappa by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA Order No. A369) and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under Grant F49620-93-1-0576 is gratefully acknowledged, as is the help of Sailaja Akunuri and Sandy German in preparing this paper.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A number of methods <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10] </ref> have been used to identify objects and discriminate regions in infrared imagery. A relatively simple method is that of Bhanu and Holben [3], who use a relaxation scheme to automatically set a threshold to separate "hot" and "cold" regions of an image. <p> This requires that the objects of interest be quite prominent. Some methods use the physics of objects in the image. Aggarwal and Nandhakumar <ref> [1] </ref> use infrared emission information together with visible reflectivity information to separate regions based on thermal properties. A paradigm often used for the extraction of objects from their backgrounds is the de tection/segmentation/feature extraction/recognition paradigm (e.g. [10]). <p> Section 5 presents experimental results of the recognition algorithm described in Section 4. Section 6 discusses conclusions and future work. 3 2 Problems with the Thermal Prediction Approach The image model approach taken here is in contrast to methods used by Nandhakumar and Aggarwal <ref> [1] </ref> in that it does not directly use knowledge about thermal interactions between background elements and objects of interest to help in their extraction. <p> The defensibility of the notion of using inverted visible imagery as a simulation of infrared imagery depends on the application. Clearly, the approach of Aggarwal and Nandhakumar <ref> [1] </ref>, which uses infrared and visible imagery together to estimate the thermal properties of objects in the image, would not be well served by this imagery, not just because the in 19 imagery. frared and visible would be essentially the same, but because they rely on relatively subtle phenomenology present in

Frequently such algorithms are particularly sensitive to imperfect segmenta tions. Bhanu gives a survey of such algorithms in <ref> [2] </ref>. Such algorithms often do not take direct advantage of knowledge of the geometry of objects, relying instead on derivative fea tures such as moments. For applications in which segmentation is particularly difficult, this can be ineffective as many commonly used features require that an intact silhouette be present.

The apparent temperature of an object is the temperature of a blackbody that would produce the same emission as the object. Thus, objects with low emissivities have lower apparent temperatures than objects at the same temperature with higher emissivities.

Reference-contexts: For this reason, we will only use probes that straddle the silhouette of our hypothesized target, and we will assume that the mag 10 nitudes of these probes follow a uniform distribution over the discrete alphabet of possible probe values. This is essentially a worst case distribution <ref> [11] </ref>. Consider a set of probes that straddle a given target silhouette. Then the likelihood ratio may be written as L (J ) = Q where K is a constant.

Reference-contexts: A common technique used to make tests of this type more robust is the use of fi Wind sorized statistics <ref> [13] </ref> to prevent abnormally large probe values from distorting the results. In this technique, probe values that exceed a threshold will be treated as if they were equal to the threshold. For the case of infrared imagery, the horizon typically causes a large jump in apparent temperature.

Reference-contexts: The problem becomes one of binary template matching, a subject discussed extensively in the literature (e.g. <ref> [14] </ref>). 11 The knowledge of the background distribution allows estimation of the false alarm rate associated with a choice of the threshold t .
