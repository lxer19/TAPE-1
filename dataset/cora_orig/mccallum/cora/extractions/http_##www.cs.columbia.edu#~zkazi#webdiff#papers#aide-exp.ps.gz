Abstract: Unlike the numerous tools that exist for identifying when documents have changed, the AT&T Internet Difference Engine (aide) identifies how they have changed. Also, because it archives past versions of pages, it provides the ability to see the evolution of pages being tracked, or to see changes across a set of related pages at the same points in time. Finally, Webguide (the Web Graphical User Interface to a Difference Engine) provides a graphical front-end to aide that enables users to see changes to many documents at once. This paper reports some experiences with aide. It discusses the evolution of the system, its current state, and future plans. It also raises some sociological and legal issues.

Reference-contexts: Second, the differences between versions of a page are useful not only to highlight changes for the user, but also to improve performance <ref> [BANG97] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: While only a limited number of pages may be of interest to an individual, the total number of pages one might pay attention to tends to increase over time. For example, Bray measured over 11 million distinct URLs in November 1995 and estimated more than 50 million by mid-1996 <ref> [BRAY96] </ref>. If one's set of pages of interest increases anywhere near that rate, it quickly becomes infeasible to monitor changes to those pages by hand. Therefore, it is not surprising that a number of tools are now available to assist users in keeping track of when pages of interest change.

Reference-contexts: Section 5 compares aide to other systems, and Section 6 concludes the paper. 2 AIDE Evolution 2.1 Notification aide began in early 1995 as a tool to track changes to web pages. I quickly became aware of w3new <ref> [Cutt95] </ref>, a Perl script for UNIX written by Brooks Cutter, which polled entries in a Mosaic hotlist and generated an HTML page listing the modification dates of the pages in the hotlist.

Reference-contexts: The AT&T Internet Difference Engine (aide) combines a centralized notification system with a version archive that allows a user to see a visual depiction of how a page has changed since he or she last saw it <ref> [DOUG96a] </ref>. It also supports recursive tracking and differencing of a page and its descendants, and graphical viewing of the relationships between these pages [DOUG96b]. fl This paper will appear in the 22nd International Conference for the Resource Management & Performance Evaluation of Enterprise Computing System (CMG96). <p> The banner at the top of the page was inserted by HtmlDiff . in HTML would be useful. Thomas Ball wrote HtmlDiff , which takes two versions of a page as input and produces a new syntactically correct HTML page that highlights the differences between the two pages <ref> [DOUG96a] </ref>. It flags inserted text with bold italics and deleted text with struck-through letters. Changes to text are treated as deletions alongside insertions. <p> HtmlDiff needs a mechanism for filtering out such changes in general, and for uninteresting changes that are particular to a single URL or set of URLs. Additional improvements and discussed below in Section 3.2. 2.4 Centralized Notification The original version of aide <ref> [DOUG96a] </ref> used the system as described in the preceding subsections. <p> Gaurav Banga, Tony DeSimone, Doug Monroe, Sandeep Sibal, and David Thorn provided comments on an earlier draft.

Reference-contexts: In particular, a recent proposal for HTTP 1.1 includes support for providing a Content-Version along with a page, and for clients to upload changes to the page with a PATCH directive and a Derived-Version header specifying the version against which the patch should be applied <ref> [FIEL96] </ref>. While this support applies to collaborative environments in which people update a common base of pages on a server, it could be extended to allow servers to provide multiple versions and clients such as aide to request specific versions rather than archiving them themselves.

Reference-contexts: Generally these tools fall into two categories: centralized services that register interests in URLs from many users (e.g., URL-Minder [URLM96], the Informant [INFO96]), and tools that run on a user's machine and will poll the URLs listed in local files such as bookmarks (e.g., Katipo [NEWB96], Surfbot [SURF96], Smart Bookmarks <ref> [Firs96] </ref>). An ever-increasing number of pages have support for notifying users of changes via email, or at least icons or "what's new" pages to highlight important changes. <p> However, some improvements and enhancements could be made: * Users might prefer to group URLs by topic, rather than by priority across all URLs. Changes to URLs could be highlighted in one's bookmark list, as with Smart Bookmarks <ref> [Firs96] </ref>, or in some other order specified by the user. <p> Again, there may be a distinction between a service that highlights the changes and individuals who do so for personal use.

Reference-contexts: If a page hasn't changed in a month, perhaps checking CMG '96 Experiences with the AT&T Internet Difference Engine 10 it daily is overkill. The time-based protocols used for cache consistency <ref> [GWER96] </ref> are especially applicable for tracking modifications for individual users. * The form to edit all URLs at once is an HTML table, so that columns are aligned.

Reference-contexts: In practice, few users were willing to adopt the system in this fashion. 2.2 Archival In the Spring of 1995, I implemented a CGI-based facility, called snapshot , which could save versions of www pages in a central repository using the Revision Control System (RCS) <ref> [TICH85] </ref>. By centralizing the repository, the system amortizes the storage overhead of storing the same or similar versions of pages for many users simultaneously.

Reference-contexts: Additional information might include: * The number of changes reported by HtmlDiff . * The number of links added or deleted. This might be especially useful when tracking pages that themselves enumerate other pages, such as in the www Virtual Li brary <ref> [VIRT96] </ref> or Yahoo [YAHO96]. * The fraction of text that has been modified. 3.3 Managing Many URLs The prioritization method described in Section 2.7 was an improvement over strict timestamp ordering when dealing with a large number of URLs.

Reference-contexts: The database informs HtmlDiff of which linked pages have versions available to compare recursively. Thus, recursion goes beyond other tools such as WebCopy <ref> [WEBC96] </ref>, which will retrieve a URL and its descendants, since it archives versions of each page separately and indicates when differences are available recursively. The basic mechanism for retrieving pages, parsing them, and retrieving their descendants is the same.
