Abstract: Technical Report UW-CSE-98-06-03 Department of Computer Science and Engineering University of Washington Abstract Cascading Style Sheets provide a flexible mechanism for governing the appearance of Web pages. Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 (CSS2) are an enhancement to the original CSS1 specification, giving Web page designers additional control over the appearance of Web pages. However, the CSS2 specification is written in English, leaving open the possibility of ambiguity or inconsistency. We present a formalization of a subset of the CSS2 specification using constraints hierarchies to help ensure that potential problems in the specification are caught and corrected. We also comment on the formalization process.

In the most recent version of the specification, this information was contained in sections 8, 9, and 10. <p> A "?" after a variable indicates that it is read-only <ref> [1] </ref>; the value of that variable may not be changed while attempting to satisfy that constraint. The constraints in this section make use of several terms to describe each node. Ref (short for "reference box") describes the box that contains the current node.

Reference-contexts: In addition, left-to-right layout is assumed for the sake of simplicity. The constraints presented in this document are based on the specification for Cascading Sytle Sheets, Level 2 as presented in http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2-19980512, last edited on May 12, 1998 <ref> [2] </ref>.
