Abstract: We propose an agent-based framework for assisting and simplifying person-to-person communication for information gathering tasks. As an example, we focus on locating experts for any specified topic. In our approach, the informal person-to-person networks that exist within an organization are used to "referral chain" requests for expertise. User-agents help automate this process. The agents generate referrals by analyzing records of email communication patterns. Simulation results show that the higher responsiveness of an agent-based system can be effectively traded for the higher accuracy of a completely manual approach. Furthermore, preliminary experience with a group of users on a prototype system has shown that useful automatic referrals can be found in practice. Our experience with actual users has also shown that privacy concerns are central to the successful deployment of personal agents: an advanced agent-based system will therefore need to reason about issues involving trust and authority.

Reference-contexts: In fact, some sociologists and economists have argued that more accurate economic models of society can be developed by viewing communities as networks of individuals, where the key ingredient for economic progress is the identification of individuals who can link people with complementary needs and resources <ref> (Burt 1995) </ref>. For a description of another Internet-based system currently being built that attempts to take advantage of such personal ties between colleagues, see Foner (1996).

Reference-contexts: We are designing and building systems that use software agents to assist and simplify person-to-person communication for information gathering tasks; we call this approach agent amplified communication. Expertise Location In a previous paper <ref> (Kautz et al. 1994) </ref>, we described our view of software agents and the particular agent platform we had built. <p> For a description of another Internet-based system currently being built that attempts to take advantage of such personal ties between colleagues, see Foner (1996). Implementation of an Expertise Locator An initial version the expertise location has been implemented by extending the user-agents as developed in the "visitorbot" project <ref> (Kautz et al. 1994) </ref>. Each user-agent has access to the following kinds of database files, each of which is specific to and owned by the individual user.

Reference-contexts: There are basically two ways of finding something out by using a computer: "ask a program" and "ask a person". The first covers all ways of accessing information stored online, including the use of the World Wide Web, traditional database programs, file indexing and retrieval programs such as glimpse <ref> (Manber and Wu 1994) </ref> or netnews readers, and even more simply, the use of tools such as ftp. The second, "ask a person", covers ways that a computer can be used as a communication medium between people.
