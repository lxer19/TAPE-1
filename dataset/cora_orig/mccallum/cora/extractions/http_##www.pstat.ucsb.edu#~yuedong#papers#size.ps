Title: Sample Size Calculations for Smoothing Splines Based on Bayesian Confidence Intervals  
Author: Yuedong Wang 
Date: October 17, 1997  
Abstract: Bayesian confidence intervals of a smoothing spline are often used to distinguish two curves. In this paper, we provide an asymptotic formula for sample size calculations based on Bayesian confidence intervals. Approximations and simulations on special functions indicate that this asymptotic formula is reasonably accurate. Key Words: Bayesian confidence intervals; sample size; smoothing spline. fl Address: Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106-3110.

Reference-contexts: We fit f (y i ; x i )g n i=1 by a cubic spline with the smoothing parameter estimated by the GML method. Spline fits are calculated using RKPACK <ref> (Gu 1989) </ref>. We then construct Bayesian confidence intervals for the smoothing spline estimate. The power is estimated by the proportion on [0; 1] that zero is outside these Bayesian confidence intervals. Repeat this process 100 times, we have 100 power estimates.

Reference-contexts: Both simulations (Wahba 1983, Wang and Wahba 1995) and theory <ref> (Nychka 1988, Nychka 1990) </ref> suggested that these Bayesian confidence intervals have good frequentist properties for f 2 W m 2 provided ^ is a good estimate of the which minimizes the predictive mean squared error. The intervals must be interpreted "across the function", rather than pointwise.
