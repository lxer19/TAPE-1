Title: Acoustic Scattering from Elastic Circular Cylinders  
Author: John D. Shumpert 
Abstract: A method for determining the acoustic scattering from elastic circular cylinders is outlined and its salient features discussed. In particular, we are concerned with determining the scattered pressure waves from an infinite solid elastic cylinder immersed in a non-viscous fluid media illuminated by an incident plane wave. The cylinder and surrounding fluid media are described by their acoustic characteristic impedance analogous to the index of refraction from optics or the wave impedance from electromagnetic wave theory. Inside the cylinder, two types of elastic waves are propagated, longitudinal bulk waves traveling in one direction and transverse shear waves traveling at a lower speed and in a different direction. In order to determine the scattered pressure wave, three boundary conditions must be satisfied, namely, that (i.) the pressure in the fluid must be equal to the normal component of stress in the solid at the surface, (ii.) the normal component of displacement of the fluid must be equal to the normal component of displacement of the solid at the surface, and (iii.) the tangential components of shearing stress must vanish at the surface of the solid. The surface of the cylinder is then simulated using an impedance boundary condition (IBC). First order and second order approximations to the IBC are derived to compare the solution for the scattering from the cylinder obtained using these approximations with the exact solution obtained by matching the boundary conditions exactly at the surface.

Reference-contexts: Since shear wave formation can effect the scattering pattern of the transducer array, it is important to understand and define this transfer of acoustic energy from longitudinal bulk energy to transverse shear energy. 6 VI. Conclusions In previous work <ref> [15] </ref>, hyperthermia treatment of liver tumors is carried out using a high-intensity optimized ultrasonic synthesized beam. The transducer array is optimized to produce a specific heating pattern at certain points in the body and a minimum at other critical points.
