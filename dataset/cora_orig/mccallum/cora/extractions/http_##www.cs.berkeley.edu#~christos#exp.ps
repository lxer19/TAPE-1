Title: THE COMPLEXITY OF OPTIMAL QUEUEING NETWORK CONTROL  
Author: Christos H. Papadimitriou and John N. Tsitsiklis 
Abstract: We show that several well-known optimization problems related to the optimal control of queues are provably intractable |independently of any unproven conjecture such as P6=NP. In particular, we show that several versions of the problem of optimally controlling a simple network of queues with simple arrival and service distributions and multiple customer classes is complete for exponential time. This is perhaps the first such intractability result for a well-known optimization problem. We also show that the restless bandit problem (the generalization of the multi-armed bandit problem to the case in which the unselected processes are not quiescent) is complete for polynomial space.

Reference-contexts: In the next section, we introduce the problem NETWORK OF QUEUES, a relatively simplified version of the problems one finds in the literature <ref> [Wal, BPT, KK] </ref>. The proof that it can be solved in exponential time relies on the fact that it can be rendered as a Markov decision process with exponentially many states, which can then be solved by linear programming.

Reference-contexts: The lemma essentially says that, as is the case with the alternating machines (another much studied variant <ref> [CHK] </ref>), stochastic machines also turn space into time one exponential higher. We first show that any space-bounded stochastic Turing machine can be simulated in exponential time.

Optimal policies in such problems can be found by computing a number of indices | known as Gittins indices | and there are polynomial time algorithms available for doing so.

Reference-contexts: It it is known that such problems 3 can be reformulated as a linear program, and thus solved in polynomial time <ref> [P] </ref>. But of course, the number of states in the Markov process (and thus, the number of variables in the linear program), is exponential in the size of the data |hence membership in EXP.

Reference-contexts: To prove completeness, we rely on a heretofore untapped alternative characterization of EXP, namely in terms of polynomial space bounded stochastic computation (a similar formulation of polynomial space as polynomial time bounded stochastic computation was proposed in <ref> [Pa1] </ref>). Besides the case of exponentially distributed service times, we show that the lower bound also holds for the case of deterministic service times, and for the case where service times have a discrete probability distribution and routing is deterministic. <p> Proof: The addition of stochastic states and acceptance convention to Turing machines is known to have the effect of turning time into space: It was shown in <ref> [Pa1] </ref> that the languages decidable by polynomial time-bounded stochastic Turing machines comprise all of PSPACE. The lemma essentially says that, as is the case with the alternating machines (another much studied variant [CHK]), stochastic machines also turn space into time one exponential higher. <p> Since there are exponentially many possible configurations, we can carry out this computation in exponential time. To show completeness, we shall show how to simulate by a stochastic machine any alternating machine with polynomial space bounds. The idea is similar to that in <ref> [Pa1] </ref> for space: Existential states are simulated by nondeterministic states, and universal states by a sequence of two stochastic states (and intervening dummy nondeterministic states with equal continuations), such that of the four continuations two elad to no accepting state, while the other two continue the computation of the simulated machine.

Reference-contexts: NP question. In particular, we show that it is EXP-complete. EXP is the class of all problems solvable in time 2 n k for some k. EXP-complete problems are the problems in EXP to which every other problem in EXP is efficiently reducible; such problems are known <ref> [Pa2] </ref> to require exponential time |independently of the status of the P=NP question. There are many such intractability results in the literature, starting from the classical ones about regular expression equivalence [SM], Presburger arithmetic [FR] and other logics such as, more recently, variants of Temporal Logic. <p> We show that this problem is PSPACE-complete even for the deterministic case. Recall that PSPACE is the class of problems solvable in polynomial space. The inclusions The inclusions PNPPSPACEEXP are well-known <ref> [Pa2] </ref>, and are all strongly believed to be proper (we only know that at least one of them is, since it can be proved that EXP properly contains P).

Reference-contexts: Networks of queues have many applications, the most important ones related to communication networks or manufacturing systems. There are precious few cases of the problem that have been satisfactorily solved and are reviewed in <ref> [Wal] </ref>; for example, the problem is wide open even for the case of two-server networks and exponential service time distributions. <p> In the next section, we introduce the problem NETWORK OF QUEUES, a relatively simplified version of the problems one finds in the literature <ref> [Wal, BPT, KK] </ref>.
