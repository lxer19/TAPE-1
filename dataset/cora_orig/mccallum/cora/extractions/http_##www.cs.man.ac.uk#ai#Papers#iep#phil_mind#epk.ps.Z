Title: Encoding Psychological Knowledge  
Author: Ian Pratt 
Abstract: A widely accepted philosophical view has it that our grasp of the psychological conceptsbelieving, desiring, intending, doubting, hoping, fearing and so onis to be understood as our mastery of a theory governing their use specifically, a theory consisting of that body of commonsense knowledge which David Lewis calls folk psychology. In this paper, I aim to show why, and in what sense, it is wrong to understand our grasp of psychological conceptsor our mastery of psychological vocabularyas knowledge, however implicit, of any theory. My strategy will be to sketch a rival view of the cognitive mechanisms underlying our grasp of psychological concepts, and to show that the operation of those mechanisms cannot effectively be duplicated by our possessing any collection of beliefs, that is to say, by our knowing any theory. In doing so, I will pay particular attention to our knowledge of the typical environmental causes and behavioural effects of our psychological states, and I shall claim that such knowledge arises through processes of observation and simulation. 1
