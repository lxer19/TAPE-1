Abstract: Let F be a field of q = p n elements, where p is prime. We present two new probabilistic algorithms for factoring polynomials in F [X] that make particularly efficient use of random bits. They are easy to implement, and require no randomness beyond an initial seed whose length is proportional to the input size. The first algorithm is based on a procedure of Berlekamp; on input f in F [X] of degree d, it uses d log 2 p random bits and produces in polynomial time a complete factorization of f with a failure probability of no more than 1=p (1*) 1 probability is exponentially small in the number of random bits used. Appeared in Journal of Symbolic Computation 9, pp. 229-239, 1990. This research was sponsored by the National Science Foundation, via grants DCR-8504485 and DCR-8552596.
