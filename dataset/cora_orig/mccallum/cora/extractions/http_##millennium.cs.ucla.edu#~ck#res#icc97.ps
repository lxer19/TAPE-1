Abstract: uniform case it deteriorates as N increases). Moreover we see that the throughput remains almost constant for the different buffer sizes shown in the same table. Both these observations lead us to the conclusion that the uneven destination port distribution has a greater impact than internal blocking due to buffer overflow or increase of the network size. Secondly, the improvement in throughput while using the DB network over the single-queue Banyan is more than 50% for this type of nonuniform traffic, definitely a considerable advantage for the DB network. We can further enhance the DB network by introducing multiple links to interconnect the queues at the different stages or by increasing the transmission speed of the internal links. For instance a speed-up 5 of two would allow two cells to be switched from one stage to the next on the same link, in the same time slot; however output links retain the same speed as the inputs, so only up to one cell can be transmitted out on a output trunk. We anticipate that speeding up the internal links will have a beneficial effect on buffer performance (since blocking to buffer overflow will be reduced) and consequently to the overall performance of the network. Another direct extension and generalization to our model would be to consider d fi d crossbar switches as SEs, that will exercise multiple input-queueing, where, for instance, we can have d (or less) FIFO queues per input port. Acknowledging the need for large, high-performance and cost-effective multistage switches we have described a Banyan-based network, the DB switch, which uses dual input queues in its switching element to buffer cells destined to different outputs. In fact we have considered two types of 2 fi 2 crossbar switching elements, the blocking and the discarding switches, and briefly discussed their merits. We have evaluated the DB switch by virtue of its throughput performance with respect to various network and buffer sizes. We have further assessed its performance by comparing it to a single-queue Banyan switch, based on throughput and mean waiting time results. We concluded that for the DB switch to be efficiently and practically functioning, it must have buffers that can hold more than one cell. We also saw that increasing its queue size improves its throughput considerably in comparison with the ordinary Banyan. For instance increasing the total, per port, queue size from 4 to 8 leads to a throughput increase of 21% for the DB switch while only 11% for the banyan (see figures 6 and 7). We recognize that we can improve a multistage network's performance at the expense of using additional hardware (e.g., IC's in our scheme) and complexity, which of course makes such solutions more expensive. However, we feel that a compromise can be always pursued according and depending on the user's and/or network's needs and requirements.
