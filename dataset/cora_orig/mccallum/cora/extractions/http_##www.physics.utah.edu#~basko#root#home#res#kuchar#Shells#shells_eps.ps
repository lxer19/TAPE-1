Abstract: Gravitating shells lead to simple minisuperspace models of black hole formation by gravitational collapse of matter. These can serve as a prelude to canonical quantization. Until recently, such models were hampered by the fact that their action was guessed rather than derived by a consistent minisu-perspace reduction of a general action principle. This problem has now been solved by Hajcek and Kijowski. We interpret here their variational principle as a Dirac-ADM canonical action principle along a timelike foliation including the shell as a leaf. We use the matter action which includes all degrees of freedom of dust shells, and introduce the action of simple field shells. We then

The super-Hamiltonian of a shell moving in a cup spacetime is more restricted. First, M needs to be put equal to zero, M = 0 , i.e., F = 1 . As a result, the TT region disappears. <p> This point of view has not been available in previous treatments of the dust shell in which the proper mass of the shell has been given a fixed constant value. In particular, the Hajcek <ref> [8] </ref> action follows from our triple-time action by partial reduction of the canonical formalism to the hypersurface of a constant momentum M conjugate to an ignorable coordinate.

Reference-contexts: An analogous dynamical variable played a key role in elucidating canonical evolution of primordial Schwarzschild black holes along spacelike foliations. <ref> [10] </ref> The Hamiltonian constraint (7.3) ensures that M cannot depend on t. We shall see later that the remaining field equations imply that M cannot depend on r either. On a solution, the constant M has the meaning of Schwarzschild mass.

Reference-contexts: At the phenomenological level, we thus limit ourselves to dust shells. Our shell Lagrangian is a three-dimensional version of the Lagrangian introduced by Brown. <ref> [11] </ref> A shell of dust is described by six scalar fields which we call T (x); Z k (x); (x); W k (x); with k = 1; 2: (5.2) 18 The functions T (x) and Z k (x) are assumed to be independent, i.e., their gradients T ;a (x); Z k <p> Similarly, for perfect barotropic fluid, the proper time T along the flowlines is no longer an ignorable variable, and the rest mass M of the fluid is no longer a constant of motion (Brown <ref> [11] </ref>). When we impose the scalar shell Hamiltonian constraint as an operator restriction on the state function (; R; M ) and consider as a matter time variable, the resulting equation contains second time derivatives @ 2 =@ 2 .

Reference-contexts: Phenomenological matter shells (made from incoherent dust, barotropic perfect fluid, or relativistic elastic sheets) have been extensively studied in literature. We found that dust coupled to gravity is an especially handy conceptual tool in interpreting quantum dynamics. <ref> [12] </ref> For spherical dust shells, the advantages of dust appear clearly in the skeleton which remains after spherical minisuperspace reduction. At the phenomenological level, we thus limit ourselves to dust shells. <p> The role of proper time along dust worldlines as a variable which brings the Dirac constraint to the Schrodinger form is quite general and depends neither on symmetry nor on confining the dust to a shell (Brown and Kuchar <ref> [12] </ref>). However, for a spherical shell this role of T is especially transparent and the Hamiltonian constraint automatically appears in the form which is linear in M. That the shell mass should be treated as a dynamical variable becomes clear from the analogy between dust shells and scalar field shells.

The discussion there highlights the distinction between canonical formalisms in Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian spacetimes, but is equally applicable to our case of spacelike and timelike foliations in a pseudo-Riemannian spacetime. 17 integration to infinity.
