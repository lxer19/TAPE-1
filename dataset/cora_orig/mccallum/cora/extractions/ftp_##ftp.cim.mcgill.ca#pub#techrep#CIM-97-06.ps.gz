Reference-contexts: Torque Ripple Compensation One important characteristic of harmonic drive torque transmission as observed in free motion experiments, is a high frequency oscillation in output torque signal (See torque curve in Figure 8). These oscillation, named torque ripples, were also observed by other researchers <ref> [1] </ref>. Torque ripples are caused mainly by harmonic drive gear meshing vibration. Harmonic drive gear meshing vibration introduces a real torque oscillation which can be observed in the end effector motions of robots using harmonic drives and even sensed by hand when back-driving the harmonic drive.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we are using the idea of a built-in torque sensor for harmonic drives as first proposed by Hashimoto in 1989 [2]. This method proved to be an economical and effective way of torque sensing for harmonic drives in our setup, as claimed by Hashimoto et al. <ref> [3] </ref>. In our testing station a Wheatstone bridge of four Rosette strain-gauges is utilized to sense the torsional torque transmitted through the flexspline. A practical an accurate method is proposed to mount the strain-gauges on the flexspline in order to minimize any radial or circumferential misplacement of each strain-gauge. <p> Thus, a Wheatstone bridge of strain-gauges as illustrated in Figure 3 can transduce the torsion into a difference voltage. The reason why Rosette strain-gauges are necessary for harmonic drive built in torque sensor, as explained in <ref> [3] </ref>, is to compensate for the elliptical shape of the flexspline. <p> while the strain caused by the elliptical shape of flexspline is called * w , Hashimoto et al. [4] illustrated that the strain applied to strain-gauge R 1 , and R 2 are ( * 2 = * t + * w 0 where * w 0 is assumed in <ref> [3] </ref> to be a sinusoidal modulation of * w . <p> A small fraction of the torque ripples are caused by the non-ideal torque measurement, because of the direct attachment of strain gauges on the flexspline. Since the flexspline has an elliptical shape, strain gauges mounted on the flexspline are subjected to unwanted strain caused by the elliptical shape. Hashimoto <ref> [3] </ref>, proposed using at least two pairs the measured torque with peaks at multiples of the velocity 13 Application of Kalman Filter for Intelligent Built-in Torque Sensor of Harmonic Drives of Rosette strain gauges to compensate for this unwanted strain.

Reference-contexts: If the strain caused by applied torque is named * t , while the strain caused by the elliptical shape of flexspline is called * w , Hashimoto et al. <ref> [4] </ref> illustrated that the strain applied to strain-gauge R 1 , and R 2 are ( * 2 = * t + * w 0 where * w 0 is assumed in [3] to be a sinusoidal modulation of * w . <p> Circumferential positioning error occurs when two Rosette strain-gauges are mounted in an angle different than 90 o from each other. This positioning error introduces more sensing inaccuracies than radial positioning error <ref> [4, 14] </ref>. Angular positioning error occurs when a Rosette strain-gauge is not mounted perpendicular to the flexspline's axis of rotation. This positioning error also introduces sensing inaccuracy similar to the circumferential positioning error.

Reference-contexts: In order to apply torque feedback on the robot joint, it is necessary to measure the transmitted torque through the actuator transmission mechanism. Conventionally, torque sensor are placed in the output transmission line of the robot <ref> [5, 10] </ref>. However, for a harmonic drive transmission, which has an elastic element, the flexspline, there is no advantage to add an additional compliant element and thereby reduce the joint stiffness.

Reference-contexts: Its performance advantages include high-torque capacity, concentric geometry, lightweight and compact design, zero backlash, high efficiency, and back drivability.

By consistency we mean a statistical measure, namely the ratio of the standard deviation to the average value of estimated parameter for different experiments <ref> [11] </ref>. If this measure is small, we have a good consistency for different experiments, and the final gain is obtained from the average value of the estimated gain for different experiments.

Reference-contexts: The performance of the on-line implemented Kalman filter for torque ripple cancellation is shown to be quite fast and accurate. The Kalman filter is used not only to estimate the torque ripples, but also to cancel any mechanical misalignment torque signature on the measured torque <ref> [15] </ref>. Many torque sensors exhibit the limitation of being sensitive to the torques applied on the direction perpendicular to their axis of measurement. In our setup after repeated use of the harmonic drive system for different experiments, a similar torque signature was observed on the measured torque.
