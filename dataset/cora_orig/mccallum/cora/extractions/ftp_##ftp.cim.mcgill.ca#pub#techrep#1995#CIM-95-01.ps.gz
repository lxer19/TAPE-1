Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The problem of two-dimensional (2D) contour segmentation is concerned with dividing a planar contour into meaningful segments. The key issue is how to determine the actual segmentation points. These are usually selected at "corners", which can be detected at sharp changes in contour curvature <ref> [8, 3, 7] </ref>. The segmented contours can then be represented in terms of more concise descriptions, suitable for high level vision tasks [4, 9]. All curvature-based approaches focus on local shape information.

Often this local information is noisy so that curvature computations, usually based on the second derivative, may be inherently unstable. To reduce these effects, a larger contour segment, i.e., a larger scale, may be employed.

Reference-contexts: Let r 1 be an observation point and r 0 be a source on the contour with charge q, as shown in Figure 3. The difference between the electrical potential at a reference point r 0 and a point r caused by q at r 0 is equal to <ref> [5] </ref>: (r) (r 0 ) = 2* 0 jr 0 r 0 j (2) Here * 0 is a constant, known as the permitivity of free space. The charge is continuously distributed along the contour. <p> as follows: (r) (r 0 ) = 2* 0 C jr 0 r 0 j dl 0 (3) Here q = (r 0 )dl 0 , (r 0 ) is the charge density at r 0 and l 0 is the path along C. 1 We use the notation in <ref> [5] </ref> 2. Method 5 According to physics [6], every point on a charged conductor in equilibrium is at the same potential. Therefore, if we restrict r in Equation (3) to the conductor surface, referred to as an equipotential surface, (r) is constant.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, the results elucidate both local corner features and the significance of contour protrusions relative to the global shape. Our idea is motivated by physics. When a charged conductor with an arbitrary shape is in electrostatic equilibrium, all charge will reside unevenly on the outer surface of the conductor <ref> [6] </ref>, as shown in Figure 1. At sharp convex corners, the charge density is very high. Conversely, almost no charge accumulates at sharp concave points. Furthermore, the larger the protrusion of a contour segment, the higher the charge density at its tip. <p> Physics. The physical model we have used is the charge density distribution on a 2D contour. To do this, we examine an infinitely long charged conductor having this 2D contour as a constant cross section. All of the charge on the conductor can only reside on its outer surface <ref> [6] </ref>. Thus the charge can only be located along the outer contour of the cross section. One can also show using Gauss' law [6] that the charge density distribution is the same at any cross section along an infinitely long conductor. <p> All of the charge on the conductor can only reside on its outer surface <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Since C in (4) is an arbitrary contour, it is impossible to perform the integration in (4). However, this integration can be solved by finite element methods <ref> [16] </ref>. To do this, we approximate the continuous contour C by a polygon. The polygon has N line segments, C k ; k = 1; :::; N , each of which is assumed to have a constant charge density, k , as shown in Figure 4 (a). <p> Invariance: Since the charge density distribution depends completely upon the total charge, as well as the shape and size of a contour, it is independent of the coordinate system chosen for computation <ref> [16] </ref>. Therefore, the charge density distribution along a contour is invariant to object translation and rotation. If the object size changes, the total surface area will change, and the charge density will thus change with scale.
