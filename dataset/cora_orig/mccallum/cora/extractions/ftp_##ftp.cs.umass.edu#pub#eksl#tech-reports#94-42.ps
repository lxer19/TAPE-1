Abstract: Many methods have been developed for inducing cause from statistical data. Those employing linear regression have historically been discounted, due to their inability to distinguish true from spurious cause. We present a regression-based statistic that avoids this problem by separating direct and indirect influences. We use this statistic in two causal induction algorithms, each taking a different approach to constructing causal models. We demonstrate empirically the accuracy of these algorithms.

Reference-contexts: In practice, we often use only the subsets of size 1. 3 clip/clasp <ref> [1] </ref> provides statistical support for fbd and ftc. In fact, each algorithm can be run within clasp's Lisp-listener interface. fbd and ftc are available as part of the clip/clasp package.

Reference-contexts: However, other experiments have shown that both fbd and ftc will often avoid predictors that are connected to the variables they predict via a common but latent cause (see <ref> [2] </ref>). Finally, fbd and ftc are simple, polynomial-time algorithms that construct models without searching the entire space of models. We believe it possible to obtain even better results while maintaining this level of complexity by integrating these techniques with others.

Reference-contexts: j will not cause a cycleg (c) For each x i 2 P , add the link x i ! x j into M (d) For each x i 2 P , Enqueue x i into Q Our pilot experiments indicated that good performance can be achieved with this approach <ref> [3] </ref>; however, two significant drawbacks were noted. The first is that we must provide fbd with knowledge not usually provided to causal induction algorithms: the identity of the sink variable. Although one expects algorithms perform better with additional knowledge, fbd does not work without it.

Reference-contexts: Many of these utilize the distributions of the statistics expected for certain configurations of variables in 1 Conditional independence tests cannot establish control when the covariance is caused by a variable not included in the set. a model. For example, the ic algorithm (see <ref> [4] </ref>) uses features of conditional independence to hypothesize the direction of a causal influence: Let I (i; j j x) denote the independence of i and j given a variable x, and let I (i; j j fl) denote the independence of i and j given some other variable. 2 Then, <p> We compared FBD and FTC with two other causal induction algorithms, ic <ref> [4] </ref> and pc [5].

Reference-contexts: We compared FBD and FTC with two other causal induction algorithms, ic [4] and pc <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> has a logical explanation: since most of the wrong links are discarded by the filter conditions, the differences between these scores indicate links that were removed to avoid cycles. 6 3.4 Comparative Performance Next, we compared each algorithm with another causal induction algorithm. fbd was compared with the pc algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>, which has the ability to deal with external constraints, such as knowledge of the sink variable. ftc was compared to the ic algorithm, since neither uses external knowledge about the data.

Reference-contexts: Recently, considerable effort has been directed towards automatically deriving a causal model from the probability distributions found in the data, a process called causal induction.[4, 5] The problem of inducing cause from data alone is notoriously difficult. Suppes <ref> [6] </ref> established three reasonable criteria for a causal relationship: covariance, control, and temporal precedence. The covariance, or similarity, between two variables, can be measured through simple statistical tests.
