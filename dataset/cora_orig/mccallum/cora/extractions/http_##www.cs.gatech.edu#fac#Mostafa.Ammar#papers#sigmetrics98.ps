Abstract: In a multicast ABR service, a connection is typically restricted to the rate allowed on the bottleneck link in the distribution tree from the source to the set of receivers. Because of this, receivers in the connection can experience inter-receiver unfairness, when the preferred operating rates of the receivers are different. In this paper we explore the issue of improving the inter-receiver fairness in a multicast ABR connection by allowing the connection to operate at a rate higher than what is allowed by the multicast tree's bottleneck link. Since this can result in cell loss to some receivers, we operate with the knowledge of each receiver's application-specific loss tolerance. The multicast connection rate is not allowed to increase beyond the point where the cell loss on a path to a receiver exceeds this receiver's loss tolerance. Based on these ideas we develop an inter-receiver fairness measure and a technique for determining the rate that maximizes this measure. We show possible switch algorithms that can be used to convey the parameters needed to compute the function to the connection's source. In addition we develop a global network measure that helps us assess the effect of increasing inter-receiver fairness on the total network delivered throughput. We also briefly explore improving inter-receiver fairness through the use of multiple virtual circuits to carry traffic for a single multicast session. A set of examples demonstrate the use of the inter-receiver fairness concept in various network scenarios.

Reference-contexts: Given these advantages, it seems likely that an ABR service will be important in both ATM and IP-based networks <ref> [1] </ref>. In this paper, we will discuss ABR in the context of ATM's connection-oriented environment [2]. An important feature of an ABR service is the "fair" allocation of bandwidth to the set of connections using the ABR service. Max-min allocation [3] is commonly accepted as a fair allocation for ABR.

Max-min allocation <ref> [3] </ref> is commonly accepted as a fair allocation for ABR. Informally, max-min allocation operates as follows: the available capacity on a link is divided equally among all ABR connections traversing the link, producing a fair share per connection.

Reference-contexts: Loss-tolerance might arise because the application is inherently robust against some losses, albeit with a degradation in quality. Real-time voice or video are examples of this type of application. Alternatively, the receivers may have some other mechanism for recovering from losses, for example using forward error correction <ref> [4] </ref> or retransmissions separate from the usual multicast transmission tree [5]. For this operating point to be preferred, the benefit to receiver BR1 (due to the increase in reception rate) must outweigh the cost to receiver BR0 (due to the losses).

In these techniques, Resource Management (RM) cells are used by receivers to convey back to the source an explicit rate indicating their bandwidth fair share on the bottleneck of the path leading to them. <p> The source also needs the group operational range and receiver weights to completely compute the IRF function. The group operational range can be computed by each switch as it receives the individual receiver's operational range much in the same way as current proposed multicast ABR mechanisms <ref> [6, 7, 8] </ref> determine the minimum rate of all receivers. The receiver weights can be conveyed along with the isolated rate information for each receiver. In the next section we describe our approach as it would be applied to ABR connections with a relatively small number of receivers.

Reference-contexts: We observe that if receivers have low or zero loss tolerance, improving inter-receiver fairness is not possible. In this section we briefly explore another possible technique, destination set grouping (DSG), that can be used to improve inter-receiver fairness for multicast ABR connections. The DSG technique was first proposed in <ref> [9] </ref>. It has since been used to provide flow control for multicast sessions in [10, 11]. Our objective here is to introduce this idea in the context of multicast ABR connections and demonstrate its potential to improve inter-receiver fairness. An in-depth examination of its use is relegated to future research. <p> Our objective here is to introduce this idea in the context of multicast ABR connections and demonstrate its potential to improve inter-receiver fairness.

With the destination set grouping technique <ref> [9] </ref>, the set of destinations in a single multicast session are split into disjoint subgroups. The source then carries independent conversations with each subgroup. By judicious splitting of the original destination set we can improve the inter-receiver fairness for the multicast ABR session.
