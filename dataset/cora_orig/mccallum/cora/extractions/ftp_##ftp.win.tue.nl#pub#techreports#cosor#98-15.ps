Abstract: In this paper we develop a closed queueing network model for a robotic milking barn. We present an approximative mean-value analysis of the model to evaluate important performance criteria such as the queue length, waiting time and utilization of the facilities in the barn. It is shown how the results from the queueing network analysis can support the discussion about the optimal design of the robotic barn.

Reference-contexts: parlor milking barns, traditional ratios of cubicles, feeding stands, water troughs and milking stalls per head have been established (see [8]), and it has already been verified that it is possible to house a larger number of cows than the number of cubicles and feeding stands without major problems (see <ref> [1, 2] </ref>). In an experimental farm in Duiven in the Netherlands the research center IMAG-DLO is investigating the behaviour of the cows in an RMB. Based on extensive measurements and observations, Halachmi et al. [6] concluded that the usage of the various facilities in an RMB is stochastic.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Dairy barns with milking robots are becoming more and more interesting from an economical point of view, cf. <ref> [5] </ref>. Nevertheless, they are expensive. So it is important to develop insight in the optimal layout of a robotic milking barn (RMB) and the optimal ratios of the various facilities in the barn and the herd size.

Reference-contexts: In an experimental farm in Duiven in the Netherlands the research center IMAG-DLO is investigating the behaviour of the cows in an RMB. Based on extensive measurements and observations, Halachmi et al. <ref> [6] </ref> concluded that the usage of the various facilities in an RMB is stochastic. This aspect should be incorporated in models used for the design of 1 an RMB. <p> The capacity of these facilities is limited, so queueing may occur. The service durations and movement between the facilities is random (see <ref> [6] </ref>). This suggests a QN model with 6 stations: 1. Milking robot, 2. Concentrate feeder, 3. Forage lane, 4. Water trough, 5. Cubicle and 6. Walking. Of these stations, Walking can be modelled as an infinite server. The other stations are single of multi servers. <p> Therefore the measured service times are upper estimates for the animals needs, independent of the herd size. An extensive presentation and discussion of the measurements can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. For the QN model we do not really need the transition probabilities between the stations. Important are only the relative number of visits to each of the stations. Many of the visits of the cows to the facilities Milking and Concentrate are in vain.

Reference-contexts: In the QN model of the barn, however, the service times are not exponential (cf. figure 2). Since non-exponential networks cannot be analyzed exactly, we will develop an approximation by adapting the MVA to this situation. Exact MVA is based on Little's formula [9] and the arrival theorem <ref> [7] </ref> stating that in a closed QN a customer moving from one station to another sees the network in equilibrium with one customer removed. Little's formula is valid under general circumstances, but the arrival theorem only holds exactly for product-form networks.

Reference-contexts: Cows are very fond of the concentrate. It is even possible to adapt the amount 2 to the specific needs of each cow, cf. <ref> [10] </ref>. The concentrate feeder is used to lure the cows into milking robot. A cow can only reach the feeder by passing through the robot. The other three (conventional) facilities are: * The Forage lane. There are in practice no limitations on forage.

Reference-contexts: The forage feeder is simply a place that has to be large enough. * The Water troughs. The water turnover rate of highly yielding cows is among the highest recorded mammals, cf. <ref> [11] </ref>. These facilities are not expensive and have a significant physiological importance, i.e., cows have to drink a lot to be able to produce up to 60 liters of milk per day. * The Cubicles. In the cubicles the cows can lay down, rest, and avoid confrontations.

Reference-contexts: The solution is a product form. General conditions under which QNs have a product-form solution are formulated in [3]. A standard technique for the analysis of product-form networks is mean-value analysis (MVA) (see <ref> [12] </ref>). The name MVA refers to the fact that it deals with relations between the quantities: 6 * mean time spent in a station, * mean number of cows in a station, and * mean number of visits per time unit to a station.
