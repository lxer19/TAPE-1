Abstract: Flow and congestion control mechanisms in tcp have been designed with the premise that network capacity should be shared equally among competing connections. With the evolution of the Internet from a class-less best-effort network to an integrated services network with different classes of service, the premise of equal fair sharing is no longer true. In an integrated services Internet, network bandwidth should be shared in accordance with the reservation made for each session. In this paper, we consider a specific class of service, namely controlled-load, which is currently under consideration for deployment in the Internet. We propose a simple scheme to realize this service and study its interaction with the control mechanisms used in tcp. In light of this study, we propose a number of enhancements to the control mechanisms used in popular implementations of tcp. Using deatiled simulation experiments, we show that with the proposed enhancements in place, tcp is indeed able to provide the desired end-to-end behavior.

Reference-contexts: In the following, we discuss a possible realization of controlled-load service based on this interpretation including the one used in the experiments reported in this paper. Two rather well-researched means of realizing different classes of service in an integrated services network is to use class-based queuing <ref> [1, 6] </ref> and weighted fair queuing [4, 7, 19, 21]. In a class-based queuing scheme, datagrams belonging to different classes are put in different queues in the routers. The queues are serviced in different priority order based on the associated traffic class.

Reference-contexts: In order to support these emerging applications better, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is developing a set of protocols and standards <ref> [2, 20, 23] </ref> with the goal of providing a number of new classes of service in the Internet. The service classes currently under consideration are controlled-load [23] and guaranteed service [20]. Controlled-load service is an enhancement to best-effort service that guarantees a minimum level of network performance at all times. <p> For example, all reserved sessions that use tcp as the transport protocol could be aggregated into a class with the ered discipline. With the RSVP reservation protocol such a classification can be accomplished by examining the protocol type for the RSVP session <ref> [2] </ref>. In this environment, it would provide a mechanism for buffer sharing and loss-priority enforcement amongst a set of reserved sessions. The scheme described above is consistent with the service definition of the controlled-load service class.

Reference-contexts: In our scheme, controlled-load traffic is policed at the source and conformant packets are marked. Non-conformant controlled-load traffic and best-effort traffic is injected into the network unmarked. At the routers we use an enhanced random early detection (red) <ref> [5] </ref> algorithm. Both marked and unmarked packets share the same fifo queue. When the queue length at the router exceeds a certain threshold, packets are dropped randomly as done in red gateways.

Reference-contexts: To the best of our knowledge no published work addresses the specific issues discussed in this paper. In a more general sense, studies on supporting tcp over abr/ubr services in atm networks <ref> [8] </ref> address similar issues. However, due to significant differences between the service architectures of atm and the Internet, the proposed solutions are quite different. In [8], the authors propose using a modified switch buffer allocation policy in order to obtain peak throughputs and fairness between tcp connections over atm. <p> In a more general sense, studies on supporting tcp over abr/ubr services in atm networks <ref> [8] </ref> address similar issues.

Reference-contexts: The controlled-load service paradigm opens up a new dimension in the design space of applications which have been developed for use in today's Internet, but are sensitive to overload conditions. For example, increasingly popular applications such as PointCast [15], Real Audio [16], VDOnet [22], and Bamba <ref> [10] </ref> stream text/image, audio, and video data over the Internet. Depending on the network load, the quality of the transmission can vary from very good to intolerable.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, tcp uses a coarse-grained timer (typically 500ms) to implement the timeout mechanism in order to minimize the system load due to timer interrupts. As a result, loss detection and subsequent retransmission in response to the receipt of duplicate acknowledgments has been called "fast retransmit". In the Tahoe <ref> [11] </ref> implementation of tcp the detection of a lost packet results in cwnd being set to 1 and ssthresh being set to the minimum of awnd and one-half of cwnd. Consequently, the source enters the slow start phase.

This is consistent with observations by other researchers which have shown that connections with longer round-trip times are slower in opening up their congestion windows <ref> [12] </ref> and thus end up getting less bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: These enhancements have been applied to both Reno and sack <ref> [13] </ref> tcp senders. No additional changes are required at the tcp receiver. Using detailed simulation experiments, we have shown that with the proposed enhancements in place, tcp provides the desired end-to-end behavior. <p> We now examine the impact and effectiveness of these enhancements in a larger multi-hop network. One of the aspects of particular importance in a large network is the delay-bandwidth product of the network, and consequently, the number of in-flight segments for a particular tcp connection. It has been observed <ref> [13] </ref> that the goodput of tcp connections suffers when there are multiple segment losses within the window. To investigate the impact of multiple packet losses on the proposed schemes, we performed a series of experiments on a multi-hop network.

Reference-contexts: To observe the effects of congestion control exercised by tcp, we set the receiver's advertised window to 100 segments which is equal to the delay bandwidth product of the unloaded network. We simulated the scenario described above using a modified ns <ref> [14] </ref> simulator.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, in the congestion avoidance phase cwnd increases by one each round-trip time. The slow start and the congestion avoidance phases correspond to an exponential increase and a linear increase of the congestion window <ref> [17] </ref> every round-trip time. The sender can detect a lost packet from either a retransmission timeout or from the receipt of multiple duplicate acknowledgments. The latter mechanism is popularly known as fast retransmit.
