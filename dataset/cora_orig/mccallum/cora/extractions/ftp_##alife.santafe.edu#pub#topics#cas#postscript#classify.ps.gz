Abstract: It's generally accepted that the following "elementary" (2 state, radius 1) rules have typical class IV (or "complex") behaviours, because they feature emergent coherent propagating structures (analagous to gliders in Life, but 1-D). These gliders move and interact on periodic backgrounds; collisions between gliders produce new gliders. Who first introduced this particular classification, began by denying that (2,1) held any class IV's, although in a supplement to an article which was published in Scientific American, some of the above Rules may have been mentioned as worthy of interest. The fundamental difficulty here is that the "Wolfram Classes" are not well defined, even by Wolfram himself. Taken at their face value, it has been proven that they can't be; in articles by Culick III, as I recall. We are somewhat in the situation of the Supreme Court justice who declared "I can't define pornography, but I can sure recognize it when I see it!" Rule 54, which Prof. Wuensche mentions, has much in common with Rule 18, which was studied by Peter Grassberger in considerable detail at one time. The point with these rules is that although they have fairly well defined stable densities, there also seems to be a law of "conservation of discontinuities." In Rule 54, this manifests with the occurrence of large triangular holes on a background of mostly small triangles and antitriangles. With Rule 18, the effect is much more subtle. If we apply the analysis described in the "about xlcau21" series to Rule 54, the mean field curve, especially the composite curve for several generations,
