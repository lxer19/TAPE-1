Abstract: We present a bimodal logic suitable for formalizing reasoning about points and sets, and also states of the world and views about them. The most natural interpretation of the logic is in subset spaces, and we obtain complete axiomatizations for the sentences which hold in these interpretations. In addition, we axiomatize the validities of the smaller class of topological spaces in a system we call topologic. We also prove decidability for these two systems. Our results on topologic relate early work of McKinsey on topological interpretations of S4 with recent work of Georgatos on topologic. Some of the results of this paper were presented at the 1992 conference on Theo retical Aspects of Reasoning about Knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Our goal is precisely to account for the easy parts of topological reasoning. Second, our study is a contribution to the ongoing development of logics of knowledge because it has an alternative interpretation in terms of the notion of effort. Traditionally ([HM], [Pa], [PR], <ref> [CM] </ref>), knowledge is defined in terms of the notion of view. An individual has a view of the world or state, and what that individual knows is whatever is true in all states which are compatible with its view.

Definition A sentence is bi-persistent if ` 3 ! 2. Semantically, this means that satisfaction of in a world x; u depends only on the point x.

Contents of this paper. <p> It is not at all obvious that lattice spaces satisfy this axiom, but it will follow from our results below. Our main results in this section are the completeness and decidability of topologic (Theorems 3.10 and 3.19). The latter result was first proved by Georgatos <ref> [G2] </ref> by a different argument. Our method gives a connection of topologic to much earlier work on topology and modal logic due to McKinsey. <p> We define bi-persistence for lattice spaces and bi-persistence for topological spaces similarly. Definition Let be the smallest set of sentences containing the atomic sentences, and closed under boolean operations and the operators 3K and 2L. Proposition 3.1 (Georgatos <ref> [G2] </ref>) All sentences in are bi-persistent on all subset spaces satisfying the intersection axiom. In particular, all sentences in are bi-persistent for intersection spaces. Proof By induction on 2 . The atomic sentences are bi-persistent by the axiom (A ! 2A) ^ (:A ! 2:A). <p> By Proposition 3.5, x; X j= top . Thus there is some u 2 O so that x; u j= top K 0 . By bi-persistence, x; u j= top as well. a 42 Theorem 3.19 (Georgatos <ref> [G2] </ref>) Suppose that is a consistent sentence of topologic. Then is satisfiable in a finite topological space. Proof We may assume that is in prime normal form ^ K 0 ^ L 1 ^ ^ L n : For 1 i n, the sentence i ^ K 0 is consistent.

From these facts, we can complete the proof of the finite model property. Let be consistent, and let S fl be a complete theory containing .

Reference-contexts: A final motivation for our work is the development of logical tools for visual reasoning, and with educational software that goes with this. Shin <ref> [Sh] </ref> gave a formal account of the use of Venn Diagrams as a tool in elementary reasoning. In a sense, her work is part of an ongoing rehabilitation of diagrammatic reasoning vis a vis purely symbolic manipulation.

Reference-contexts: The project of relating topology to modal logic was begun by McKinsey [McK]. Our language and semantics are more expressive than S4 and McKinsey's topological interpretation of it, and in fact we obtain an embedding of the theorems of S4 into those of topologic. Vickers' book <ref> [Vi] </ref> on the logical and conceptual foundations of topology is a step closer to the kind of notions that we make explicit. In a sense, one could say that our logics allow one to study the aspects of the Stone duality where shrinking an open corresponds to gaining 4 information.
