Reference-contexts: Three were built at universities (one at Wichita State <ref> [1] </ref>[2] and two at Carnegie Mellon (CMU)[6][8]), one at a NASA facility (JPL)[11], and one privately (AutoCrawler LLC)[14]. These efforts have been supported by the FAA [1][2][6], the Air Force [11], the State of Pennsylvania [8], Boeing [1], private entrepreneurs [8][14], and, in kind if not in cash, by US Airways [6][8] and Northwest Airlines [8].

Reference-contexts: Aircraft inspection was addressed as first among many possible applications for a generic suction-cup-based crawler. The series is notable for a design that uses one very large diameter suction cup on its belly and a smaller suction cup on each leg (or arm). ROSTAM III <ref> [2] </ref> is shown on a section of aircraft material (apparently wing) in Fig. 1. Many theoretical aspects of the ROSTAM series design (suction cups [3], safety issues [2], sensory guidance [4]) and their hypothetical inspection capability (automated crack monitoring using a vision system [5]) have been reported in the technical conference <p> ROSTAM III <ref> [2] </ref> is shown on a section of aircraft material (apparently wing) in Fig. 1.
