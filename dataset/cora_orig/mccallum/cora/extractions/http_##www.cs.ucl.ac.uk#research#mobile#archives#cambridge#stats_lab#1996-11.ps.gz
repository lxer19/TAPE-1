Title: Notes on Effective Bandwidths  
Author: Frank Kelly 
Address: Cambridge  
Affiliation: University of  
Abstract: This paper presents a personal view of work to date on effective bandwidths, emphasising the unifying role of the concept: as a summary of the statistical characteristics of sources over different time and space scales; in bounds, limits and approximations for various models of multiplexing under quality of service constraints; and as the basis for simple and robust tariffing and connection acceptance control mechanisms for poorly characterized traffic. The framework assumes only stationarity of sources, and illustrative examples include periodic streams, fractional Brownian input, policed and shaped sources, and deterministic multiplexing.

Of course other perspectives are possible. In particular, Shwartz and Weiss <ref> (1995) </ref> explore several more detailed aspects of buffer behaviour for on-off fluid sources of the type defined in Section 2.3.2, using this model to illustrate the considerable power of large deviation theory. 4 Tariffs and connection acceptance The effective bandwidth of a source depends sensitively upon its statistical characteristics. <p> An advantage of the on-off model, both for tariffing and connection acceptance control, is that it bounds other more complex source models. The reader surprised that schemes using only simple load measurements can guarantee strict quality of service requirements should see Gibbens et al. <ref> (1995) </ref>, where issues of robustness and performance are investigated in some detail. Of course on-off sources may, on a finer time scale, have more detailed structure, as in example 2.3.4. This may give rise to additional constraints of the form (3.3). <p> The models of Sections 2.3.1 or 3.5 might be appropriate as a conservative bound when source i is policed by parameters (ae i ; fi i ), where fi i =ae i = 1; this approach is described for a single source type in Gibbens et al. <ref> (1995, Section 6) </ref>. A less conservative approach would use the same space and time scales, around (s; t) = (2fl=b; 1=2), to assess the aggregate fine time scale load (4.1). Work in progress concerns how such connection acceptance controls might be implemented.

Reference-contexts: The logarithmic moment generating function is naturally associated with the additive property (iii), while the scalings with t and s beget properties (i) and (iv) respectively. Properties (i)-(iv) are straightforward consequences of convexity and of results on moment generating functions see Chang <ref> (1994) </ref> for several relevant observations, as well as a discussion of the case, not considered here, when the increments of X [0; t] may be non-stationary. <p> The third case exhibits long range order (Norros 1994; Willinger 1995), and has been proposed as a model for Ethernet traffic data (Willinger et al. 1995). Fig. 3 illustrates the form (2.8) with parameters H = 0:75, = 1 and oe 2 = 0:25. Courcoubetis and Weber (1995), Weber <ref> (1994) </ref> discuss the approximation of the effective bandwidth of an arbitrary stationary source by a Gaussian source with general autocovariance structure, using the first two terms of the expansion (2.4). <p> a stationary source is policed by parameters (ae; fi) if X [0; t] aet + fi 0 &lt; t &lt; 1; (2:12) or, equivalently, ff (1; t) ae + t The parameters ae and (fi 1)=ae are the peak cell rate and cell delay variation tolerance of ITU Recommendation I371 <ref> (1994) </ref>. For example, the periodic source described in Section 2.3.1 is policed by parameters (ae; fi) provided ae b d and fi b. A fluid source, as described in Section 2.3.2, is policed by parameters (ae; fi) provided ae max i fh i g. <p> If ff sh (s; t) is the effective bandwidth of the departure stream from the queue, then ff sh (s; t) may be calculated from expression (2.7), where h i takes values 0 or C. De Veciana et al. <ref> (1994) </ref> have extensively explored the impact of shaping on the limiting form of the effective bandwidth as t ! 1. <p> that a Gaussian source, with effective bandwidth ff (s; t) = + oe 2 s=2, 10 Frank Kelly shaped by passage through a queue with service rate C, has ff sh (s; 1) = + 2 C = C 2oe 2 s otherwise: (2.14) More generally, de Veciana et al. <ref> (1994) </ref> consider a wide class of arrival processes for which ff (s; 1) &lt; 1 for some s, and show that ff sh (s; 1) = ff (s; 1) for values of s less than a critical level, while above this level the impact of the peak rate C is felt <p> The examples of Section 2.3 show that even if the limit (3.20) exists, convergence to the limit may be arbitrarily slow; further, for finite values of t, ff (s; t) may be much smaller or larger than the limit ff (s). The examples of Choudhury et al. <ref> (1994) </ref> can be interpreted as further illustrations of this phenomenon. The usefulness of the limit (3.21) thus depends on the rate of convergence to this limit, and whether convergence has essentially occurred on the time scales of interest. <p> Then Duffield and O'Connell (1996) show that lim log P fQ bg 1 H (1 H) 2 (1H) (3:22) agreeing with an earlier bound of Norros <ref> (1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The effective bandwidth of a source depends upon two free parameters, representing a space and time scaling respectively, and, as Gibbens <ref> (1996) </ref> demonstrates, this dependence provides a convenient tool for the description and analysis of real sources. The appropriate choice of space and time scale will depend upon characteristics of the resource such as its capacity, buffer size, traffic mix and scheduling policy. <p> A linear limiting form was established for more general input processes, including the fluid sources studied in detail by Gibbens and Hunt (1991) and Elwalid and Mitra (1993), by Ke-sidis et al. (1993): we review this result in Section 3.3, together with its recent generalization by Duffield and O'Connell <ref> (1996) </ref>. In the models of Sections 3.1 Notes on Effective Bandwidths 11 and 3.3 time scales essentially degenerate: the time scale t fl appearing in (3.3) approaches zero or infinity. In Sections 3.4 and 3.5 we describe two tractable models illustrating phenomena when time scales do not degenerate. <p> In Sections 3.4 and 3.5 we describe two tractable models illustrating phenomena when time scales do not degenerate. In Section 3.6 we discuss the important recent results of Botvitch and Duffield (1995), Simonian and Guibert (1995) and Courcoubetis and Weber <ref> (1996) </ref> on an asymptotic regime where the form (3.3) emerges, for finite values of t fl , as a tangent to the limiting acceptance region. <p> The form (3.4) is differentiable, while, for example, the function (2.13),(2.14) obtained from a shaped process has a discontinuous derivative at the critical point s = (C )=oe 2 , where there is a transition away from a regenerative regime. Duffield and O'Connell <ref> (1996) </ref> have extended buffer asymptotics to examples where the limit (3.20) does not exist, but where, with a suitable rescaling, a large deviation principle may still be applied. <p> We illustrate their result with a simple example. 3.3.1 Fractional Brownian input Suppose that ff (s; t) is given by expression (2.8), corresponding to fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H. Then Duffield and O'Connell <ref> (1996) </ref> show that lim log P fQ bg 1 H (1 H) 2 (1H) (3:22) agreeing with an earlier bound of Norros (1994). <p> This example will be explored further in Section 3.6.1. 3.6 Buffer and source asymptotics In Sections 3.1 and 3.3 we described asymptotic results when the number of sources or the buffer size, respectively, increased. Recently Botvich and Duffield (1995), Simonian and Guibert (1995) and Courcoubetis and Weber <ref> (1996) </ref> have obtained important results when the number of sources and the buffer size increase together, the regime considered in a key early paper of Weiss (1986). Again suppose that the arrival process is given by the superposition (3.1), where the increments of X ji [0; t] are stationary. <p> A more subtle illustration is provided by examples 3.6.1 and 3.6.2 below. Several further examples are discussed in detail by Botvitch and Duffield (1995), Simonian and Guibert (1995) and Courcoubetis and Weber <ref> (1996) </ref>. Si-monian and Guibert (1995) also describe bounds and estimates that parallel the tilted approximations (3.11), (3.12). 3.6.1 A Brownian bridge model Suppose that ff ji (s; t) is given by expression (3.28).

Reference-contexts: More generally, consider a stationary source described by a finite Markov chain with stationary distribution and q-matrix Q, where workload is produced at rate h i while the chain is in state i. Then from the backward equations for the Markov chain one can deduce <ref> (Kesidis et al. 1993, p.427) </ref> that ff (s; t) = st where h = diag (h i ) i , and lim ff (s; t) = s where OE (s) is the largest real eigenvalue of the matrix Q + hs (Elwalid and Mitra 1993).
