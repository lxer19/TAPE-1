Title: Integrating Information Sources Using Context Logic  
Author: Adam Farquhar Angela Dappert Richard Fikes Wanda Pratt 
Address: Stanford University  
Affiliation: Knowledge System Laboratory  
Abstract: It is essential to reduce the cost of integrating information sources and to provide a path that allows for incremental integration that can be responsive to users' demands. This paper presents an approach to integrating disparate heterogeneous information sources that uses context logic. Our use of context logic reduces the upfront cost of integration, provides an incremental integration path, and allows semantic conflicts within a single information sources or between information sources to be expressed and resolved.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, there may be many possible proofs of a single query that correspond to alternate query execution plans. There is ample opportunity for optimizing the query (or equivalently finding the least expensive proof). This general approach is also taken by the SIMS project, as well as by Levy <ref> [11] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: This paper presents an approach to integrating disparate heterogeneous information sources. Our approach uses context logic to ease integration and provide for incremental integration. Existing approaches do not provide either adequate integration (loosely coupled databases <ref> [12] </ref> ), or adequate flexibility (federated databases [16] ), or acceptable costs (global schemas [8,9,17] ). Recent work has begun to draw on the insights of the artificial intelligence and knowledge representation communities.

Reference-contexts: The SIMS project [1] has focused more on the issues of query optimization and planning than on the resolution of semantic conflicts. We share a number of goals with the metadata approach [15] , but our technical approach differs substantially. McCarthy and Buvac <ref> [14] </ref> discuss the application of context logic to integrating databases. Although the techniques we describe are applicable to a wide variety of information sources, this paper focuses on structured information sources such as relational databases. The difficulty with integrating relational databases is that their views of the world differ.

We use contexts to represent the semantic requirements of users. Sciore <ref> [15] </ref> presents an example in which one stock quoting service provides the latest trading price and another reports the latest closing price. For many purposes the distinction is essential and needs to be disambiguated (as the units were in the product example). For others, however, it may be irrelevant.
