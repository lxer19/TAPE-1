Title: The Multimedia Multicast Channel  
Author: J. Pasquale and G. Polyzos and E. Anderson and V. Kompella 
Address: San Diego  
Affiliation: Computer Systems Laboratory Department of Computer Science and Engineering University of California,  
Abstract: The Multimedia Multicast Channel (or simply "the Channel") provides a "television broadcast channel" programming abstraction for a group of distributed processes which communicate multimedia information such as video and audio streams in a dissemination-oriented fashion. By dissemination-oriented, we mean that there is a single mul-ticasting source, with a varying number of destinations "tuned in" to a Channel, and that there is a very loose coupling between the source and the destinations.

Reference-contexts: A prime example is "video distribution" [GM91, Sinc90], as in Cable Television systems where a single source generates video (and associated audio) distributed to a large set of receivers who generally have little or no interaction with the source. Another application is video conferencing <ref> [Casn90, Enso88, VZSR91] </ref>, where each member is both a source and receiver, and would require one of our Channels per source to support base-level audio/video distribution. However, video conferencing also requires other control mechanisms which are outside the scope of what is provided by the Channel.

Reference-contexts: Most of the work in this area is revolving either around low-level communication protocols or groupware applications, which typically simulate multicast through a series of unicasts. However, the support for dissemination-oriented communication paradigm is beginning to receive attention <ref> [Cher92] </ref>. The pioneering work on IP multicasting [DC90] is fueling some of the current protocol work, which is based on a group communication protocol, the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) [Deer89].

Reference-contexts: At a lower level, a segment, with its size defined by the application, is considered a relatively independent piece of information. It is advantageous for the network protocol software to treat the segment as the data unit of manipulation <ref> [CT90] </ref>. Applications are expected to recover gracefully from loss of segments (at least for some media components). Therefore, cooperation between the network system software and the operating system dictates that segments be transported atomically through the protocol stack and the network.

This protocol specifies how multicast groups can be formed and managed with little change to the basic infrastructure of IP. The two major changes to the implementation of IP to accommodate multicasting are the provision of IP multicast addresses and the IGMP protocol described in [Deer89]. Multicast groups are created by individual hosts explicitly joining the groups, i.e., using IGMP to include them in the address list corresponding to a multicast address. The actual multicast routing is done by routers that learn the shortest path routes to the destinations.

Reference-contexts: This experimental protocol supports multicasting and resource negotiation appropriate for continuous media, but the protocol itself does not include specific implementation mechanisms, e.g., for multicast route set-up or network resource reservation (instead, such mechanisms must be provided outside of the protocol). The multicast routing algorithm described in <ref> [KPP92] </ref> optimizes network performance for continuous media, making it a strong choice for Channel support. It constructs a source-rooted multicast tree which efficiently uses bandwidth while bounding delay between the source and all destinations.
