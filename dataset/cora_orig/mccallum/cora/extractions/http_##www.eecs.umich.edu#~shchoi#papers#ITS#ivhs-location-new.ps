Abstract: Many Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications require some form of location information. For example, traveler information services and traffic management are both critically dependent on the specification of location(s). Some ITS applications may need this information in finer resolution than others as demonstrated by the navigation and route guidance systems vs. severe weather warnings for a local area. A location can be a street address, a highway segment, an intersection, a stretch of roadway or a small geographical area. These types of locations can be coded in various ways. In this paper, we first examine several coding schemes reported in the literature and/or used in real applications. Then, we propose a new location coding scheme based on the first three digits of the Zipcode plus local information. This scheme uniquely represents all useful types of locations and is versatile and efficient. Moreover, it fits well the location reference message protocol (LRMP) described in [Goodwin et al., 1995, Goodwin and Xiong, 1994]. To demonstrate its utility and power, we compare the proposed scheme with the Road Name ID scheme [Ramakrishnan et al., 1994]. The work reported in this paper was supported in part by Loral Incorporated and the US Department of Transportation under Grant No. DTFH61-93-X-00017.

Reference-contexts: This is also because that the naming is based on implicit coding of countries and FM station coverage areas. 2.2 (Latitude, Longitude) Pair Since the Global Positioning System (GPS <ref> [Getting, 1993] </ref>) has been made available for civilian use, one can expect to obtain GPS location information with errors as small as one meter, with differential position correction. One natural proposal is to use the (latitude, longitude) pair to represent locations.

Reference-contexts: Rather, they suggested the strategy of appropriate (-ing) IVHS. In the context of location referencing schemes, the authors proposed an umbrella message protocol the Location Reference Message Protocol (LRMP) to provide conduit for different location schemes, while maintaining a standard application interface at the system level (see also <ref> [Goodwin and Xiong, 1994] </ref>). In the remainder of this section, we will evaluate several proposed location naming schemes with respect to the required features listed in Section 1.

The authors of <ref> [Goodwin et al., 1995] </ref> presented an exhaustive analysis of functional requirements of ITS map database applications. They concluded emphatically that a single, standardized, across-the-board ITS system is not achievable or advantageous. Rather, they suggested the strategy of appropriate (-ing) IVHS.

Reference-contexts: Within each district, we devise a new scheme to name local locations for the purpose of reporting traffic incidents. With this scheme, a district as depicted in the Loral-IBM IVHS Architecture report <ref> [IVHS America, 1994] </ref> can contain one or more Zipcode-specified areas. The naming of locations within a given district can be divided into four categories for ITS reports and inquiries: residential streets/areas, freeways/expressways, major arteries, and points of interest.

Reference-contexts: However, it takes four location identifiers (IDs) in the scheme to identify a small problematic area. It is difficult to use the scheme to describe larger areas that are not bounded by named roads, such as in weather reports. 2.4 Metropolitan Area Dependent Coding A location coding scheme <ref> [Kady and Ristenbatt, 1993] </ref> that is based on segment IDs and designed for RBDS (Radio Broadcast Data Systems, the US counterpart of the European RDS, see [NRSC, 1992]).

The scheme calls for a local authority to identify the most traveled road segments and small strategic areas in a particular metropolitan area's road network, map each such location to a unique 14-bit integer.

Reference-contexts: When a low bandwidth wireless channel is used for these inquiries, an inquiry from the client and the response from the information server should be as compact as possible. Only recently there have been published reports on the location naming convention <ref> [Ramakrishnan et al., 1994] </ref>. In general, any satisfactory ITS location coding scheme should be: 1. Universal for all intended geographical areas which normally include metropolitan areas and rural roadways. Location finding in off-road areas can be dealt with using GPS-capable de vices. 2. <p> Another weakness of the (latitude, longitude) scheme is its inability to identify road segments such as overlapping segments of stacking highways, where the (latitude, longitude) information for points on different highways can be the same. 3 2.3 Road Name ID Scheme Ramakrishnan et al. <ref> [Ramakrishnan et al., 1994] </ref> proposed a scheme that uses road names as the base for universal location naming. All street/road names used in the country are first collected and duplicate names removed. Each unique street name is given an identifying number. <p> The entire conversion process should be repeated continuously by the on-board computer or as frequently as desired. 4.6 Comparison With Road Name ID The proposed scheme is compared with the Road Name ID scheme <ref> [Ramakrishnan et al., 1994] </ref> in Table II, where RID is the road ID; DIR specifies the direction of the road identified by RID; TYPE specifies the type of road that RID is; CID identifies the administrative region in (city, state) pair.

Reference-contexts: These schemes, along with our own proposal, can best be viewed as individual application protocols that are to be encapsulated by LRMP in implementation. 2.1 Alert-C The European Traffic Message Coding Protocol (Alert-C) <ref> [RDS ALERT Consortium, 1990] </ref> was developed to unify location and message coding for RDS (Radio Data System), utilizing one of FM radio subcarriers to transmit digital data. It provides unique location naming throughout Europe.
