Abstract: A society of agents is one in which many agents coexist and interact with each other while carrying out their tasks. Each agent builds a certain level of expertise. Thus the interactions among agents would help each agent to carry out its task better by tapping into the collective knowledge assets of the society. Agents may differ in the ways in which they interact with other agents. As the society evolves, agents may change from one type to another. This kind of an environment presents interesting dynamics. In this report, we describe a simulator that models such a society of agents. Using a package delivery domain, agent interactions, their relative performances and the evolution and performance of the society as a whole are studied.

Reference-contexts: The agents rely on sophisticated planning or search capabilities and complex state information. Much of the past work in societies of agents has dealt with agents that are fine-grained and simplified aggregate models of behavior. Hu berman and Hogg [3], Sekaran and Sen [6], and Ep-stein and Axtell <ref> [1] </ref> exemplify such studies. This literature deals with agents with little or no state and few inference steps. Agent behavior is often a function of a few state variables.

Reference-contexts: A section of the multi-agent systems community has studied complex agents, but the systems themselves consisted of a small number of agents: five to ten in number, or often even just two. Plaza et. al [5], Garland and Alterman <ref> [2] </ref>, Nagendra Prasad and Lesser [4], and Weiss [7] are examples of such work. KOLEM has been built to deal with a large number of agents, each of which is itself a complex reasoner a case base reasoner in our studies.
