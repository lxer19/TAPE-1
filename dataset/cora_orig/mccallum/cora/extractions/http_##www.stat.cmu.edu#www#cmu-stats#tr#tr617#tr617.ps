Abstract: R. A. Fisher and Jerzy Neyman are commonly acknowledged as the statisticians who provided the basic ideas that underpin the design of experiments and the design of sample surveys, respectively. In this paper, we reconsider the key contributions of these great men to the two areas of research. We also explain how the controversy surrounding Neyman's 1935 paper on agricultural experimentation in effect led to a split in research in experiments and sample surveys.

Reference-contexts: Russell quickly recognized Fisher's genius and set about converting the temporary position to a more permanent one <ref> (see Box, 1978, pp. 96-97) </ref>. In 1921, Fisher published the first of a series of papers entitled "Studies in crop variation" intended for the Journal of Agricultural Science, 1 in which he presented some of his reanalyses of the Broadbalk data. <p> Meanwhile, Neyman was working on a series of papers on hypothesis testing with Egon Pearson, and on some agricultural experimentation problems. By the late 1920s, Fisher was becoming restless at Rothamsted and considered applying for positions at British Universities <ref> (Box, 1978, pp. 202-203) </ref>. Box (1978) and Reid (1982) describe some of the correspondence between Fisher and Neyman in 1932 and 1933, primarily about Neyman's paper with Egon Pearson on tests of hypotheses. <p> A major issue between the two was responsibility for teaching of statistics. Pearson proposed that Fisher not teach statistical theory, and so Fisher responded by proposing to teach the logic and philosophy of experimentation <ref> (Box, 1978, p. 259 and Bennett, 1990, p. 192) </ref>. Here we see another impetus for Fisher to complete the book on experimental design. In mid 1933, upon hearing of Fisher's appointment at University College, Neyman wrote to him asking about the possibility of a position in the Laboratory.

Reference-contexts: But not all of his Rothamsted colleagues had fully accepted Fisher's insistence on randomization as the foundation of experimentation <ref> (Box, 1980) </ref>. In fact, Fisher's 1926 article was at least in part a response to an article by Sir John Russell, director of Rothamsted, on the state of the art in experimental design. <p> his paper, Russell had noted Fisher's argument for randomization but said that it was impossible to use in practice! Despite this disagreement, Russell allowed Fisher and Eden to run their complex randomized designs on fields at Rothamsted and this ultimately convinced many others of the value of Fisher's innovative ideas <ref> (Box, 1980) </ref>. 4.

Reference-contexts: There is, however, another important feature of Neyman's first paper on the topic of agricultural experimentation we think especially worthy of note. For a number of years, we have pursued the parallels and linkages between surveys and experiments <ref> (e.g., see Fienberg and Tanur, 1987, 1988, 1989) </ref> and, in particular, Fisher's and Neyman's roles as progenitors of ideas in both areas.

Reference-contexts: We see this as another indication of the lack of impact of Neyman's early contributions in these two interrelated fields. At the 1927 ISI meeting, Corrado Gini presented a paper on the application of the purposive method to the sampling of records from the 1921 Italian census <ref> (see Gini, 1928, and Gini and Galvani, 1929) </ref>, which was to play a pivotal role in the later work by Neyman. They needed to discard most of the records of the 1921 census before taking the next one, and they proposed to retain a sample for future analyses and reference.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, during the discussion, Fisher concurred in this method; and it appears that the Gauss-Markoff technique, now known to be of doubtful validity in sampling theory <ref> (Godambe, 1955) </ref>, was one of the very few points on which Neyman and Fisher were in agreement." 4 Neyman envisions a universe of districts divided up into strata according to the values of one or more control variates, and then each stratum is subdivided into substrata according to the number of

Reference-contexts: Jensen served as rapporteur and leader of the discussion at the meeting. The Commission Report <ref> (Jensen, 1926a) </ref> contains a description of two methods: random sampling (with all elements of the population having the same probability of selection), and purposive selection of large groups of units (in modern terminology clusters) chosen to match the population on selected control variates.

Reference-contexts: When Neyman tried to explain to Pearson his confusion between independence and lack of correlation (in halting English and in front of several other Pearson students), Pearson interrupted: "That may be true in Poland, Mr. Neyman, but it is not true here." <ref> (Reid, 1982, p. 57) </ref> Dismayed at having offended Pearson and at perhaps having lost a chance to publish in English his Polish mentors had sent Neyman to England as a kind of test to see if his ideas were worth anything, and a publication in English would go a long way <p> He also notes that he worked in 1920 under Bernstein to apply the theory of probability to experimentation in agriculture <ref> (Reid, 1982, p.30) </ref>. We know that, before he left Poland, he worked with a Professor Isseroff on statistical analysis of agricultural experiments and even lectured to the Agricultural Department at the University of Kharkov on the application of probability theory to experimental problems in agriculture. <p> He had been working for the Institute for Social Problems on a project involving sampling from the Polish census to obtain data to describe the structure of the working class in Poland. As he wrote to Egon Pearson, he used the opportunity and "pushed a little the theory" <ref> (Reid, 1982, p. 105) </ref>.
