Title: Hidden Annotation in Content Based Image Retrieval  
Author: Ingemar J. Cox Thomas V. Papathomas Joumana Ghosn Peter N. Yianilos Matt L. Miller 
Abstract: The Bayesian relevance-feedback approach introduced with the PicHunter system [5] is extended to include hidden semantic attributes. The general approach is motivated and experimental results are presented that demonstrate significant reductions in search times (28-32%) using these annotations.

Reference-contexts: We also observe that in some settings, such as the emerging area of Internet Web publication, authors are implicitly annotating their images by their choice of text to surround them. Exploiting this textual proximity represents an immediate and interesting direction for future work. This general direction is explored in <ref> [14, 1] </ref>. It is not clear how high in the semantic sense our approach of hidden attributes might reach.

Reference-contexts: Individual images were either in "portrait" (4.83 x 7.25 cm on the screen) or in "landscape" (7.25 x 4.83 cm) format. They were padded with dark pixels either horizontally or vertically to form square icons. The images in the database <ref> [2] </ref> were copied from a set of CDs by Corel Inc., each CD containing 100 images. Each image is referred to by its unique identification number, which is denoted by "ID" in this paper. Eight users, labeled A to H, participated in this ex periment.

Reference-contexts: By contrast, the simplest encoding consists of the image's raw pixel values. Intermediate between these two extremes is a spectrum of possibilities, with most work in the area focusing on low level features, i.e. straightforward functions of the raw pixel values (see <ref> [13, 15, 3, 4, 6, 9, 8, 10] </ref> and many others [11, 16, 17, 18]). Some such features, such as color, begin to capture an image's semantics, but at best they represent a dim reflection of the image's true meaning.

Reference-contexts: For these reasons we are led to study hidden languages for semantic encoding, and in particular hidden boolean attributes affixed to each database image. Our ability to follow this research direction is made possible by the general navigational paradigm introduced in <ref> [5] </ref> and used by the PicHunter image retrieval system. (see [12] for other learning-based work). With this approach a user navigates through a database by selecting similar images from the set currently displayed. No explicit query is formulated. <p> The overall implementation of a hidden attribute approach may be divided into two components: the design of the schema of attributes, and the approach taken to assigning attribute values to each database image. Both of these contain rich opportunities for future work. PicHunter's <ref> [5] </ref> use of low-level image statistics may be viewed as a hidden attribute approach. This paper represents a first step intended to help establish the general approach's potential at a higher semantic level by focusing on a particularly simple case. <p> An additional set of category keywords were then assigned automatically. For example, the "lion" attribute causes the category attribute "animal" to be present. Altogether there are 134 attributes. These supplement the 18 low-level features used by the basic PicHunter version, and described in <ref> [5] </ref>. The 134 semantic attributes are regarded as a boolean vector, and normalized Hamming distance combines their influence to form, in effect, a 19th PicHunter feature. The PicHunter user interface is particularly Spartan. <p> Prior to requesting additional candidates the user selects the subset of the nine visible images that he/she regards as most similar to the target image. Our experiments implement the target testing model of <ref> [5] </ref> in which the user seeks to locate a given target under the user interface described above. Performance is measured by the number of display iterations required to locate the target image. That is, how many nine-image displays the system had to present before the sought after image appeared. <p> They were also made aware of the priority of the features in the user model, from the most to the least important, according to <ref> [5] </ref>. Similarly, before a session with the semantic version of PicHunter in the second phase, users were told to base similarity not only on image appearance, but also on image semantic contents, as one would describe them by words.
