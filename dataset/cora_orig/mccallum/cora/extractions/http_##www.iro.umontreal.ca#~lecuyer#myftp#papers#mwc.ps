Title: DISTRIBUTION PROPERTIES OF MULTIPLY-WITH-CARRY RANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS

Abstract: We study the multiply-with-carry family of generators proposed by Marsaglia as a generalization of the previous add-with-carry families of [7]. We define for them an infinite state space and focus our attention on the (finite) subset of recurrent states. This subset will, in turn, split into possibly several subgenerators. We discuss the uniformity of the d-dimensional distribution of the output of these subgenerators over their full period. In order to improve this uniformity for higher dimensions, we propose a method for finding good parameters in terms of the spectral test. Our results are stated in a general context and are applied to a related complementary multiply-with-carry family of generators.

Reference-contexts: In Section 2, we give a characterization of the recurrent states, and show that any state in will quickly evolve into rec . A close connection is also established between the recurrent states and a certain linear congruential generator (LCG). This connection was investigated in [11] and <ref> [1] </ref>, again in the AWC/SWB case. We then distinguish two aspects of the question of d-dimensional uniformity, requiring different methods. These are discussed in Sections 3 and 4 respectively. We see in Section 3 that the problem leads to some arithmetical questions. <p> In Section 4, we make use of the well-known spectral test. We examine in this respect some specific instances proposed in [6]. We also indicate a method of search for parameters which are good according to this test. The spectral test had been used in [11] and <ref> [1] </ref>, to obtain distribution properties of the AWC/SWB generators for dimensions d &gt; r.

Reference-contexts: By the analytic class number formula of Dedekind (see x51 of <ref> [2] </ref>), the right-hand side of (25), and therefore D m , is nothing but the number h of ideal classes of the imaginary quadratic field Q ( p ) of discriminant = m. In particular D m &gt; 0, that is, there are always more residues than non-residues in I.

In this case, the carry component of a recurrent state is non-negative. One may also allow the coefficients a l to be negative. When none of them are positive, we call the defined generator a complementary multiply-with-carry generator. <p> Marsaglia <ref> [6] </ref> obtained one such result in the special case of AWC/SWB generators. It states that almost every r-tuple of numbers of the form y=b, with y an integer satisfying 0 y &lt; b, will appear exactly once as an output r-tuple in a full period. <p> These are discussed in Sections 3 and 4 respectively. We see in Section 3 that the problem leads to some arithmetical questions. In Section 4, we make use of the well-known spectral test. We examine in this respect some specific instances proposed in <ref> [6] </ref>. We also indicate a method of search for parameters which are good according to this test. The spectral test had been used in [11] and [1], to obtain distribution properties of the AWC/SWB generators for dimensions d &gt; r. <p> We illustrate this using two sets of parameters proposed by Marsaglia <ref> [6] </ref>. Both have b = 2 16 , and r = 8. In both cases, the choice of coefficients a l makes m and (m 1)=2 prime, so that b generates the group of quadratic residues modulo m, and we thus have two non-trivial orbits.
