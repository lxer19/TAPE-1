Title: Abstract  
Abstract: We present a type of signal driver that, without compromising speed, dissipates considerably less power than the commonly thought to be unavoidable. We describe a design procedure that, given the available charging time, yields a driver with minimum dissipation. We also describe an experimental circuit that confirms the predictions.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the I/O frame is frequently responsible for a large part of the total power dissipation of a processor chip, up to 50% for the ATT92010 (Hobbit) chip <ref> [1] </ref>, so improvements in this area are most desirable. Furthermore, many current processor designs use a faster clock for internal than for external signalling. The desire to use low-cost, low-speed memory chips with high-performance processors [2] is one reason for this; superpipe-lining [3] is another.

The internal frequency is usually chosen to be small integer multiple of the external one. These facts combine to make significant power dissipation savings possible through the use of output drivers using stepwise charging.

Reference-contexts: The problem seems to be how to maintain the desired voltages on the tank capacitor bank. On closer examination, it turns out that over time, the tank capacitor voltages will converge automatically to the desired voltages <ref> [4] </ref>. No extra circuitry is required, only one supply line must be routed to the chip, and the power supply is no more complicated than in the conventional case. <p> If on the other hand is chosen unneces-sarily large, time is wasted that could have been used to increase the number of steps. It can be shown <ref> [4] </ref> that the value minimizes the dissipation for large values of , under the key assumptions that the on-resistances of the switches are linear and that all steps use the same .
