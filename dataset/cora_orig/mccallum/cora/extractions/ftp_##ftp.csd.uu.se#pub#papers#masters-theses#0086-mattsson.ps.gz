Abstract: Dilemma" is a simple tool for manual translation of natural language. It is designed to help translators achieve higher quality in their work, with less effort. The data consists of previously translated texts that concerns the same domain as the text to be translated. The general idea is to extract terminologic and syntactic information from the previously translated texts to maintain consistency, which is often a quality criterion, in the new translations. To calculate likely translation candidates, several language independent aspects are being measured. All aspects are based on theories and assumptions about general texts in Eu-ropean languages. This paper describes the current Dilemma system and its capacities; concentrating on the new functionality. It also includes a discussion about possible future improvements. Introduced in this, the second version of Dilemma, are among other things a more general alignment procedure, stop list handling and checking of spelling similarity. Even with a small training corpus, the translation grade normally supersedes 75% of correct word-to-word translations.

Reference-contexts: To do this efficiently, a word table like the one mentioned in section 9.1 is needed. There are several methods of measuring word distribution. One of the most promising is the K-vec algorithm <ref> [5] </ref> which measures word distribution without use of text structure. It divides the text into K parts of equal size and compares the pattern of occurrences. With the use of a word index table, this calculation can be done efficiently.

Reference-contexts: Despite these facts, the prototype is working. Is this kind of tool useful? There is definitely a need for good translation tools <ref> [9] </ref>. The earlier versions of Dilemma were tested by professional translators, who thought Dilemma could be useful if it was further developed. The main objection was its lack of speed. To make it really useful, several improvements are needed.

Reference-contexts: What if they are combined? A cascade of methods, similar to what is described by Melamed <ref> [18] </ref>, could be the basis of a successful method. As seen in previous examples, the choice of parameters is a trade-off between translation quality and the number of candidates. With a high quality limit there will be fewer translations (see figure 18).

Reference-contexts: The clustering can be achieved by expanding the word index table mentioned in section 9.1. The big problem is to limit the search space and only select the interesting clusters. In text materials, there often are many repetitious elements <ref> [19] </ref>. Patterns of recurrence are often important for good translations. The techniques to handle these patterns are focused on limiting the search space and can therefore be suitable when trying to find interesting clusters.

Reference-contexts: Then, more than 75% of the suggested words are correctly translated while only cutting off 50% of the words in the text. No thorough investigations about finding the ideal configuration has been done. There is no objective answer <ref> [20] </ref>. Firstly, because there will always be a trade-off between translation quality and the number of translations. Secondly, because every text has its own, unique, optimum configuration.

Reference-contexts: The assumption here is that a word, which recently has been suggested as a translation for another word, is less likely to be a good suggestion for the current translation. This method has been used in the other direction; to translate different document versions <ref> [21] </ref>. In that case, texts are often repetitive and a word (or a phrase) that already has been translated is likely to be translated in the same text.
