Abstract: Registration is a fundamental task in image processing used to match two or more pictures taken, for example, at different times, from different sensors or from different viewpoints. Over the years, a broad range of techniques have been developed for the various types of data and problems. These techniques have been independently studied for several different applications resulting in a large body of research. This paper organizes this material by establishing the relationship between the distortions in the image and the type of registration techniques which are most suitable. Two major types of distortions are distinguished. The first type are those which are the source of misreg-istration, i.e., they are the cause of the misalignment between the two images. Distortions which are the source of misregistration determine the transformation class which will optimally align the two images. The transformation class in turn influences the general technique that should be taken. The second type of distortion are those which are not the source of misregistration; this type usually effects intensity values but they may also be spatial. Distortions of this type are not to be removed by registration but they make registration more difficult since an exact match is no longer possible. They effect the choice of

Reference-contexts: The intensity transformation is frequently not necessary, except, for example, in cases where there is a change in sensor type (such as optical to radar [Wong 77]) or where a simple look up table determined by sensor calibration techniques is sufficient <ref> [Bernstein 76] </ref>. After all, if the images are matched exactly, then what information can be extracted? Finding the spatial or geometric transformation is generally the key to any registration problem. <p> All distortion can be classified as either static/dynamic, internal/external and geometric/photometric. Static distortions do not change for each image and hence can be corrected in all images in the same procedure via calibration techniques. Internal distortions are due to the sensor. Typical internal geometric distortions in earth observation sensors <ref> [Bernstein 76] </ref> are centering, size, skew, scan nonlinearity, and radially (pin-cushion) or tangentially symmetric errors. <p> In the simplest scheme, the minimum can be determined by setting the partial derivatives to zero, giving a system of T = (m+2)(m+1)=2 linear equations known as the normal equations. These equations can be solved if the number of control points is much larger than T. <ref> [Bernstein 76] </ref> uses this method to correct satellite imagery with low-frequency sensor-associated distortions as well as for distortions caused by earth curvature and camera attitude and altitude deviations.

Reference-contexts: In [Duda 73], it is suggested that a triangle be matched by first finding three separate lines and then determining if a triangle is indeed present. A better solution is offered by [Widrow 73], (elaborated upon by <ref> [Burr 81] </ref>), who introduces the rubber template, a template which can be locally distorted, so that information between local matches can be utilized. This is described in more detail in section 3.4 If the image is noisy, the peak of the correlation may not be clearly discernible. <p> The flexible template technique was implemented by defining specific parameters for the possible deformations in each problem domain. These were used to iteratively modify the tem 34 plate until the best match was found. However, it was not until more re-cently <ref> [Burr 81] </ref> that automatic elastic registration methods were developed. Burr accomplished this by an iterative technique which depends on the local neighborhood whose size is progressively smaller with each iteration.

Reference-contexts: Images are often preprocessed in order to make these assumptions more valid. For example, Gaussian smoothing can be applied to limit the bandwidth. In an extension of the phase correlation technique, <ref> [De Castro 87] </ref> has proposed a technique to register images which are both translated and rotated with respect to each other. Rotational movement, by itself without translation, can be deduced in a similar manner as translation using phase correlation by representing the rotation as a translational displacement with polar coordinates. <p> Rotational movement, by itself without translation, can be deduced in a similar manner as translation using phase correlation by representing the rotation as a translational displacement with polar coordinates. But rotation and translation together represent a more complicated transformation. <ref> [De Castro 87] </ref> present the following two step process to first determined the angle of rotation and then determine the translational shift. Rotation is invariant with the Fourier Transform. Rotating an image, rotates the Fourier transform of that image by the same angle. <p> Although this might be accomplished by computing the transform after first rotating in the spatial domain, this would be too costly. <ref> [De Castro 87] </ref> applied the transform to a zero-padded image thus increasing the resolution and improving the approximation of the transform after rotation. Other interpolation techniques, for instance, nearest neighbor and bilinear interpolation, proved to be unsatisfactory. <p> This has the advantage over <ref> [De Castro 87] </ref> of the computational savings gained by adding images instead of multiplying them due to the use of logarithms. The work of [De Castro 87] summarizes previous work published in Italy before 1987, but no direct comparison with [Lee 87] has yet been undertaken. <p> This has the advantage over <ref> [De Castro 87] </ref> of the computational savings gained by adding images instead of multiplying them due to the use of logarithms.

Reference-contexts: In general, the coarse-to-fine strategy improves convergence since the search for local similarity function maxima is guided by results at coarser levels. Thus, like Burr's method, iteration, cooperation and a hierarchical structure are exploited. A very similar method was proposed by <ref> [Dengler 1986] </ref> for solving the correspondence problem in moving image sequences. To increase the speed and reliability, the external forces were computed from local binary correlations based on the sign of the Laplacian.

Reference-contexts: As the number of templates grows, however, the computational costs quickly become unmanageable.

Reference-contexts: Also, since the image is bounded, or in other words, a window of the signal has been taken, a distortion due to the frequency components of the window will be introduced in the frequency-domain <ref> [Gonzalez 77] </ref>. In summary, in using the Fourier transform, it has been assumed that the images are bandlimited and accordingly Nyquist sampled, and periodic with the image size. Images are often preprocessed in order to make these assumptions more valid. <p> Images are usually preprocessed in an attempt to extract intrinsic structure. This reduces the effects of scene and sensor noise, forces matching to optimize structural similarity and reduces the corresponding search space. Image enhancement techniques <ref> [Gonzalez 77] </ref> can be used to emphasize structural information. For example, homomorphic filtering can be used to control the effects of illumination and enhance the effects of reflectance. Edges, because they represent much of the intrinsic structures of an image, are the most frequently used feature space.

They are one member of the class of features used because their values are independent of the coordinate system. However, as scalars, they have no spatial meaning.

Reference-contexts: The mapping transformation is then computed for each point in the image from interpolation of the vertices in the triangular patch to which it belongs.

Reference-contexts: Therefore many applications use automatic location of control points. Typical features that are used are corners, line intersections, points of locally maximum curvature on contour lines, centers of windows having locally maximum curvature, and centers of gravity of closed-boundary regions <ref> [Goshtasby 88] </ref>. Features are selected which are likely to be uniquely found in both images (a more delicate issue when using multisensor data) and more tolerant of local distortions. These and many other features are discussed in more detail in section 4.1. <p> Other techniques involve clustering, relaxation, matching of minimum spanning trees of the two sets and matching of convex hull edges of the two sets <ref> [Goshtasby 88] </ref>. Instead of mapping each point individually, these techniques map the set of points in one image onto the corresponding set in the second image. Consequently the matching solution uses the information from all points and their 26 relative locations. <p> Orthogonal polynomials can be readily generated using the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process. They also have the additional nice property that the accuracy of the transformation can be increased as desired without recalculating all the coefficients by simply adding new terms until the the error is sufficiently small <ref> [Goshtasby 88] </ref>. The major limitation of the global point mapping approach is that a global transformation cannot account for local geometric distortions such as sensor nonlinearities, atmospheric conditions and local three dimensional scene features observed from different viewpoints. <p> Another registration technique proposed by Goshtasby, which is also derived from the interpolation methods discussed in Franke's study is called the local weighted mean method <ref> [Goshtasby 88] </ref>. In this method, a polynomial of order n is found for each control point which fits its n 1 nearest control points.

Reference-contexts: Typically, the intensity histogram and other statistics about the distribution of intensities are used such as in the method developed by [Wong 77] to register radar and optical data using the Karhunen-Loeve transformation. Sometimes intensity correction is performed simultaneously with geometric correction <ref> [Herbin 89] </ref>. Since a common objective of registration is to detect a change between two images, it is important that images are matched only with regards to the misregistration source. Otherwise the change of interest will be removed at the same time. <p> For this reason, techniques which are applied to dissimilar 14 images often have a special need to model the misregistration source.

Reference-contexts: Although most registration methods search the space of allowable transformations, other types of searches may be advantageous when other information is available. When the source of misregistration is known to be perspective distortion, [Barrow 77] and <ref> [Kiremedjian 87] </ref> search the parameter space of a sensor model to map an image to a three dimensional database. For each set of sensor parameters, the 3D database is projected onto the image and its similarity is measured.

Reference-contexts: In this section, the basic methods used to register images using Fourier analysis will be described. An elegant method to align two images which are shifted relative to one another is to use phase correlation <ref> [Kuglin 75] </ref>. Phase correlation relies on the translation property of the Fourier transform, sometimes referred to as the Shift Theorem. <p> Among other things, whitening is invariant to linear changes in brightness and makes the correlation measure relatively scene-independent. On the other hand, cross-correlation is optimal if there is white noise. <ref> [Kuglin 75] </ref> suggest introducing a generalized weighting function to the phase difference before taking the inverse Fourier Transform, so that there exists a family of correlation techniques, including both phase correlation and conventional cross-correlation.

Reference-contexts: Although substantial computational savings are gained, the method is no longer robust except for relatively small translations. The Fourier methods, as a class, offer advantages in noise sensitivity and computational complexity. <ref> [Lee 87] </ref> developed a similar technique which uses the power cepstrum of an image (the power spectrum of the logarithm of the power spectrum) to register images for the early detection of glaucoma. <p> This has the advantage over [De Castro 87] of the computational savings gained by adding images instead of multiplying them due to the use of logarithms. The work of [De Castro 87] summarizes previous work published in Italy before 1987, but no direct comparison with <ref> [Lee 87] </ref> has yet been undertaken. Both methods achieve better accuracy and robustness than the primary methods mentioned in Section 3.1 and for less computational time than classical correlation.

Reference-contexts: However, successful registration is capable of identifying the structural sites of metabolic activities (such as tumors) that might otherwise be difficult to ascertain <ref> [Maguire 90] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The primary general transformations are affine, projective, perspective, and polynomial. These are all well-defined mappings of one image onto another. Given the intrinsic nature of imagery of nonrigid objects, it has been suggested <ref> [Maguire 89] </ref> that some problems, especially in medical diagnosis, might benefit from the use of fuzzy or probabilistic transformations.

He uses a stochastic model of the noise in the image to search, probabilistically, for the maximum likelihood image registration in images which have been displaced relative to each other. Another important factor in determining the appropriate model, besides the allowable transformations, is the allowable distortions.

Reference-contexts: Instead of mapping each point individually, these techniques map the set of points in one image onto the corresponding set in the second image. Consequently the matching solution uses the information from all points and their 26 relative locations.

Reference-contexts: Since the remaining computation is purely local, it is relatively efficient but its success is strictly limited by the number, location and proximity of the control points which completely control the final registration. <ref> [Ratib 88] </ref> suggests that it is sufficient for the "elastic" matching of Positron Emission Tomographic images of the heart, to first globally match the images by the best rigid transformation and then improve this by a local interpolation scheme which perfectly matches the control points.

Reference-contexts: Not surprisingly, the more that is known about the type of distortion present in a particular system, the more effective registration can be.

Reference-contexts: Correlation and its sequential counterpart, are optimized for exact matches therefore requiring image preprocessing if too much noise is present. Fourier methods, such as phase correlation, can be used on raw images when there is frequency dependent noise. Another possible similarity measure suggested by <ref> [Venot 84] </ref> is based on the number of sign changes in the pointwise subtraction of the two images. If the images are aligned and noise is present, the number of sign changes is high, assuming any point is equally likely to be above zero as it is to be below.

Reference-contexts: In [Duda 73], it is suggested that a triangle be matched by first finding three separate lines and then determining if a triangle is indeed present. A better solution is offered by <ref> [Widrow 73] </ref>, (elaborated upon by [Burr 81]), who introduces the rubber template, a template which can be locally distorted, so that information between local matches can be utilized. <p> One of the earliest attempts to correct for local distortions using an elastic model-based approach was called the "rubber-mask" technique <ref> [Widrow 73] </ref>. This technique was an extension of template matching for natural data and was applied to the analysis of chromosome images, chromatographic recordings, and electrocardiogram waveforms. The flexible template technique was implemented by defining specific parameters for the possible deformations in each problem domain.

Reference-contexts: Lastly, these can be projected onto image 2 by the factor f =(z 2 f ), again by similar triangles. Of course, if these are discrete images, there is still the problem of interpolation if the registered points do not fall on grid locations.

Reference-contexts: Using curves and surfaces as a feature space requires measures such as sum of squares of differences between nearest points. Structural or syntactic methods have measures highly dependent on their properties. For example, the minimum change of entropy between "random" graphs is used as a similarity criteria by <ref> [Wong 85] </ref> for noisy data in structural pattern recognition. The choice of similarity metric is one of the most important elements of how the registration transformation is determined. Given the search space of possible transformations, the similarity metric may be used to find the parameters of the final registration transformation.

Reference-contexts: The intensity transformation is frequently not necessary, except, for example, in cases where there is a change in sensor type (such as optical to radar <ref> [Wong 77] </ref>) or where a simple look up table determined by sensor calibration techniques is sufficient [Bernstein 76]. After all, if the images are matched exactly, then what information can be extracted? Finding the spatial or geometric transformation is generally the key to any registration problem. <p> Their correction becomes important when integrating information between images and using point differences during geometric correction. Typically, the intensity histogram and other statistics about the distribution of intensities are used such as in the method developed by <ref> [Wong 77] </ref> to register radar and optical data using the Karhunen-Loeve transformation. Sometimes intensity correction is performed simultaneously with geometric correction [Herbin 89].
