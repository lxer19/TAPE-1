Abstract We present a haptic rendering framework that allows the tactile display of complex virtual environments. This framework allows surface constraints, surface shading, friction, texture and other effects to be modeled solely by updating the position of a representative object, the virtual proxy. This abstraction reduces the task of the haptic servo control loop to the minimization of the error between users position and that of the proxy. This framework has been implemented in a system that is able to haptically render virtual environments of a complexity that is near and often in excess of the capabilities of current interactive graphic systems.

Reference-contexts: The separation of the haptic and application/graphic processes was first proposed by Adachi et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. Decoupling the low-level force servo loop from the high-level control is needed since the haptic servo loop must run at a very high servo rate, typically greater than 1000Hz. Most graphic application programs typically run at a much slower rate (around 30Hz).

Reference-contexts: Another interesting approach to the modeling of textures is based on the modification of the force-shading constraint planes in a manner similar to that employed in bump mapping in computer graphics <ref> [3] </ref>. In our current system a texture bump-map generates at most one additional constraint plane for each textured surface. This approach is adequate to model continuously differentiable textured surfaces.

Reference-contexts: This problem may be solved using the same algorithm employed in the collision detection process <ref> [7] </ref>. The vertices of the closest face, edge or vertex indicate which of the corresponding constraint planes bound the solution. Once the bounding planes have been determined Equation 1 may be solved using only the identified planes as constraints.

Reference-contexts: Once x is found the iteration can continue. This problem may be solved using a general quadratic programming package like Gill et. al <ref> [8] </ref>. There are, however, many simplifications that make a simpler and faster solution possible. In our implementation, this problem is solved in two stages. The minimum set of active constraint planes is identified first; this set is then used to find a new subgoal position.
