Title: COMP 203: Parallel and Distributed Computing Solutions to Problem Set 1 1. Consider the following

The step complexity is fi(lgn). This follows from the number of iterations of the for loop on lines 5 to 11. Lines 2 and 12 take fi(1) steps. The work done on lines 2 and 12 is fi(n). The work done in the loop on line 5 is given by W (n 1) (n 2) (n 4) (n 2 k1 n log n (n 1) fi(n log n): Here is a PRAM description of the algorithm. The number of processors used is p 2 l Let m be n=p. Every processor is identified by a unique number i.
