Abstract: This paper analyzes the conditions when a discrete set of images implicitly describes scene appearance for a continuous range of viewpoints. It is shown that two basis views of a static scene uniquely determine the set of all views on the line between their optical centers when a visibility constraint is satisfied. Additional basis views extend the range of predictable views to 2D or 3D regions of viewpoints. A simple scan-line algorithm called view morphing is presented for generating these views from a set of basis images. The technique is applicable to both calibrated and uncalibrated images.

Reference-contexts: Linear interpolation of p 0 and p 1 yields (1 s)p 0 + sp 1 = (1 s) Z 1 1 P 1 s P where s = (1 s) 0 + s 1 (1) Image interpolation, or morphing <ref> [ Beier and Neely, 1992 ] </ref> , therefore produces a new view whose projection matrix, s , is a linear interpolation of 0 and 1 and whose optical center is C s = [sC X 0 0] .

Reference-contexts: This procedure is identical to rectification techniques used in stereo vision <ref> [ Robert et al., 1995 ] </ref> . This suggests a three-step procedure for view synthesis: 1. Prewarp: ^ I 0 = H 1 0 I 0 , ^ I 1 = H 1 2. <p> In terms of F the condition on H 0 and H 1 is T FH 0 = ^ F (2) Solutions to Eq. (2) are discussed in <ref> [ Seitz and Dyer, 1996a, Robert et al., 1995 ] </ref> . We have established that two images can be rectified, and therefore interpolated, without knowing their projection matrices. As in Section 3, interpolation of the prewarped images results in new views along C 0 C 1 .

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, all processing occurs at the scanline level, effectively reducing the original 3D synthesis problem to a set of simple 1D image transformations that can be implemented efficiently on existing graphics workstations. The work presented here extends to perspective projection previous results on the orthographic case <ref> [ Seitz and Dyer, 1995 ] </ref> . when 0 1 &gt; 0 for all pairs of scene points P and Q in the same epipolar plane. We begin by introducing the monotonicity constraint and describing its implications for view synthesis in Section 2.

Reference-contexts: Towards this end, it can be shown <ref> [ Seitz and Dyer, 1996a ] </ref> that two images are in the parallel configuration when their fundamental matrix is given, up to scalar multipli cation, by ^ F = 6 0 0 0 0 1 0 7 We seek a pair of homographies H 0 and H 1 such that the <p> In terms of F the condition on H 0 and H 1 is T FH 0 = ^ F (2) Solutions to Eq. (2) are discussed in <ref> [ Seitz and Dyer, 1996a, Robert et al., 1995 ] </ref> . We have established that two images can be rectified, and therefore interpolated, without knowing their projection matrices. As in Section 3, interpolation of the prewarped images results in new views along C 0 C 1 . <p> Another method is to simply interpolate the components of H 1 0 and H 1 1 , resulting in a continuous transition from I 0 to I 1 <ref> [ Seitz and Dyer, 1996a ] </ref> . Both methods for choosing the post warp transforms generally result in the synthe sis of projective views. <p> However, the prediction of any range of view-space depends on the assumption that all possible pairs of views within that space satisfy monotonicity. In particular, a monotonic range may span no more than a single aspect of an aspect graph <ref> [ Seitz and Dyer, 1996a ] </ref> , thus limiting the range of views that may be predicted.

Reference-contexts: If this condition is not satisfied, it is still possible to apply the procedure if the prewarped images are never explicitly constructed, i.e., if the prewarp, morph, and postwarp transforms are concatenated into a pair of aggregate warps <ref> [ Seitz and Dyer, 1996b ] </ref> . The prewarp step implicitly requires selection of a particular epipo-lar plane on which to reproject the basis images. <p> One solution is to have the user provide the homog-raphy directly or indirectly by specification of a small number of image points <ref> [ Laveau and Faugeras, 1994, Seitz and Dyer, 1996b ] </ref> . Another method is to simply interpolate the components of H 1 0 and H 1 1 , resulting in a continuous transition from I 0 to I 1 [ Seitz and Dyer, 1996a ] . <p> Each pair of images was uncalibrated and the fundamental matrix was computed from several manually-specified point correspondences. The first pair of images shows two views of a face. A sparse set of user-specified feature correspondences was used to determine the correspondence map <ref> [ Seitz and Dyer, 1996b ] </ref> . The synthesized image represents a view halfway between the two basis views. Some artifacts occur in regions where monotonicity is violated, e.g., near the right ear. The second pair of images shows a wooden mannequin. <p> Blurring is caused by image resampling, which is done three times in the current implementation. The problem may be ameliorated by super-sampling the intermediate images or by concatenating the multiple image transforms into two aggregate warps and resampling only once <ref> [ Seitz and Dyer, 1996b ] </ref> . 7 Conclusions In this paper we considered the question of which views of a static scene may be predicted from a set of two or more basis views, under perspective projection.
