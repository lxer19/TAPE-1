Title: Complexity of Indexing: Efficient and Learnable Large Database Indexing

Abstract: Object recognition starts from a set of image measurements (including locations of points, lines, surfaces, color, and shading), which provides access into a database where representations of objects are stored. We describe a complexity theory of indexing, a meta-analysis which identifies the best set of measurements (up to algebraic transformations) such that: (1) the representation of objects are linear subspaces and thus easy to learn; (2) direct indexing is efficient since the linear subspaces are of minimal rank. The index complexity is determined via a simple process, equivalent to computing the rank of a matrix. We readily re-derive the index complexity of the few previously analyzed cases. We then compute the best index for new cases: 6 points in one perspective image, and 6 directions in one para-perspective image; the most efficient representation of a color is a plane in 3D space. For future applications with any vision problem where the relations between shape and image measurements can be written down in an algebraic form, we give an automatic process to construct the most efficient database that can be directly obtained by learning from examples.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, for object recognition using either direct indexing or search, it is better to use an indexing space where the picture manifolds are as simple as possible (for example, hyperplanes rather than quadrics), and have as low a rank as possible. Jacobs <ref> [1, 3] </ref> defined the concept of indexing space, and studied the complexity of picture manifolds. However, Jacobs did not address the manipulation of the indexing space.

Reference-contexts: Search: If we have parametric representations of the picture manifolds, we can efficiently store those representations. Given a set of measurements computed from an image, we search the database to find the picture manifold which covers the measurements point in R n (e.g., alignment <ref> [2] </ref>). The first approach is the most time-efficient since no search is required. However, clearly the form of the picture manifold is critical here: if it is too complex, it may not be feasible to represent this picture manifold in memory.

We obtained the same rank 3, while using a different 4-dimensional measurement vector (a different indexing space).

Reference-contexts: This is what is usually called an invariant in the literature.

Reference-contexts: If on the other hand a model-based invariant is used, the picture manifold may be a complex hypersurface in the indexing space. For example, Murase & Nayar <ref> [7] </ref> use a very general class of objects and illumination conditions, and therefore they have to represent picture manifolds which take on rather complex shapes. <p> Moreover, parametric representations of general manifolds may not even be computable (cf. <ref> [7] </ref>). (2) Using noisy measurements, it is easy to find the distance of a measurement point from a hyperplane (unlike general manifolds), which is the problem that an object recognition algorithm needs to solve.

The database now is an r-dimensional table, and a pointer to object S is stored in all the cells of the table that satisfy (1). In order to achieve efficient recognition, we would like to find a representation of the form (1) with the smallest r.
