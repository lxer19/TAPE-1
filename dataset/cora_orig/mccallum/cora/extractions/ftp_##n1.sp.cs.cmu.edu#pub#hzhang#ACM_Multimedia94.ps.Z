Abstract: Emerging distributed multimedia applications have stringent performance requirements in terms of bandwidth, delay, delay-jitter, and loss rate. The Tenet real-time protocol suite provides the services and mechanisms for delivering such performance guarantees, even during periods of high network load and congestion. The protocols achieve this by using resource management, connection admission control, and appropriate packet service disciplines inside the network. The Sequoia 2000 network employs the Tenet Protocol Suite at each of its hosts and routers making it one of the first wide area packet-switched networks to provide end-to-end per-connection performance guarantees. This paper presents experiments with the Tenet protocols on the Se-quoia 2000 network including measurements of the performance of the protocols, the service received by real multimedia applications using the protocols, and comparisons with the service received by applications that use the Internet protocols (UDP/IP). We conclude that the Tenet protocols successfully protect the real-time channels from other traffic in the network, including other real-time channels, and allow channels to continue to meet their performance guarantees, even when the network is highly loaded.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction High speed networks are enabling the coexistence of computer data traffic with new multimedia applications. The widespread use of video and audio tools over the Internet has demonstrated the potential advantages of integrated services packet switched networks <ref> [2] </ref>. Currently, most of these applications are based on the Internet Protocol Suite [3], which adopts a connection-less architecture in the network layer. In the current Internet, IP routers do not discriminate between packets from different conversations. The network provides best-effort service and is vulnerable to congestion.

Reference-contexts: implications of the measurements and conclude. 2 Background In order to set the context for the experiments, this section provides background information about the Tenet protocols and the Sequoia 2000 testbed. 2.1 Tenet Protocol Suite The Tenet protocol suite provides real-time or guaranteed performance communication services in an internetworking environment <ref> [4] </ref>. The protocol suite adopts a connection-oriented and reservation-based architecture. The basic abstraction is the real-time channel, which defines communication services with guaranteed traffic and performance parameters in a packet-switched network [6].

Reference-contexts: Sequoia scientists require networks which support real-time scientific visualization and video conferencing applications as well as high-speed data delivery services for the massive data sets characterizing global change applications <ref> [5] </ref>. To satisfy these requirements, Sequoia researchers are investigating methods for providing both real-time and best-effort services for voice, video, and data delivery on the Sequoia network.

Reference-contexts: The protocol suite adopts a connection-oriented and reservation-based architecture. The basic abstraction is the real-time channel, which defines communication services with guaranteed traffic and performance parameters in a packet-switched network <ref> [6] </ref>. A channel's traffic is characterized by its peak rate, average rate, an averaging interval and a maximum packet size. The possible performance parameters include end-to-end packet delay, delay-jitter, buffer overflow probability and delay bound violation probability.

Reference-contexts: In the measurement, we incorporated a technique developed by David Mills and enhanced the granularity of the DECStation 5000/240 system clock to 1 microsecond by taking advantage of an undocumented 25MHz hardware register. To measure the end-to-end throughput and packet inter-arrival times we used tcpdump <ref> [7] </ref> to obtain packet traces at the destination host, and used post processing to separate the packet streams corresponding to the different streams. The qualitative assessment of the comparative video performance was based on an opinion poll. A similar method has been used in [8].

Reference-contexts: The qualitative assessment of the comparative video performance was based on an opinion poll. A similar method has been used in <ref> [8] </ref>. To measure the performance of the control protocol (RCAP) we used the enhanced system clock to place microsecond accurate timestamps on the control packets themselves.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, these results are a qualitative confirmation of the data in the previous section indicating that use of the Tenet Protocol Suite is indeed significantly beneficial to the end user. The ILP demonstration is documented on video tape in <ref> [9] </ref>. 4.4 Connection Setup Time The control protocol used for channel establishment and resource reservation is called the Real-time Channel Administration Protocol (RCAP). RCAP is responsible for performing the admission control tests and maintaining the network state necessary for resource management.

Reference-contexts: RMTP/RTIP vic sessions are unaffected by each other as well as the IP data loading that occurs during the sessions. 1 The local delay bound may be changed by the Dynamic Channel Management algorithm <ref> [10] </ref>. Without loss of generality, we assume that there is no DCM for the purpose of this discussion. 4.3 Qualitative Investigations The purpose of the Tenet protocol suite is to provide end-to-end performance guarantees to network clients that require such a service.

Reference-contexts: As shown in the figure, the Internet protocols, which are used to provide a best-effort service for non-real-time traffic, coexist with the Tenet protocols. 2.2 The Sequoia 2000 Network The Sequoia 2000 network provides the communications infrastructure for global change researchers and computer scientists involved in the Sequoia 2000 Project <ref> [11] </ref>. Sequoia scientists require networks which support real-time scientific visualization and video conferencing applications as well as high-speed data delivery services for the massive data sets characterizing global change applications [5]. <p> Sequoia researchers at the sites shown in Figure 2 use scientific workstations in their studies of global change. Typically, global change researchers use their workstations to load, browse, and query objects such as satellite weather maps and global climate modeling data in the Bigfoot database <ref> [11] </ref> located at UC Berkeley using the Sequoia network as the transport medium. Additionally, many Sequoia workstations now support network transmission of digitally-encoded audio and video streams.
