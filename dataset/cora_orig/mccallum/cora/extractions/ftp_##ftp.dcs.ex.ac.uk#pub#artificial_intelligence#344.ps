Title: Quantum-inspired genetic algorithms

Abstract: A novel evolutionary computing method | quantum inspired genetic algorithms | is introduced, where concepts and principles of quantum mechanics are used to inform and inspire more efficient evolutionary computing methods. The basic terminology of quantum mechanics is introduced before a comparison is made between a classical genetic algorithm and a quantum inspired method for the travelling salesperson problem. It is informally shown that the quantum inspired genetic algorithm performs better than the classical counterpart for a small domain. The paper concludes with some speculative comments concerning the relationship between quantum inspired genetic algorithms and various complexity classes. This paper will be presented at the IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC-96) to be held at Nogaya, Japan, in May 1996.

Reference-contexts: If progress continues at this rate future computer circuits will be based on nanotechnology 3 and the behaviour of such circuits will have to be given in quantum mechanical terms rather than in terms of classical physics, since on the atomic scale matter obeys the laws of quantum mechanics <ref> [1] </ref>. As technology heads towards the nano and quantum level, there will be an increasing need for computational paradigms which can benefit from their proximity to the quantum hardware. Such computational paradigms will require less translation to quantum `machine language' than their classical counterparts and will therefore have efficiency benefits. <p> It is currently not clear how true quantum computation algorithms will be related to quantum hardware (e.g. quantum logic gates <ref> [1] </ref>). It is possible that quantum-inspired computing will provide the benefits of portability across different quantum hardware platforms should `quantum compilers' be feasible. The quantum-inspired techniques described here enrich our knowledge of how parallel computation techniques can be used for implementing genetic algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Cryptography is used to encode the secret transactions of banks, governments, and the military. Public key systems widely employ key production methods based on RSA. RSA is named after its inventors Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman <ref> [9] </ref>. Briefly, two distinct large prime numbers are chosen randomly, p and q. Their product r = p fi q is calculated. A large integer e is chosen that is relatively prime to (p 1) fi (q 1); e is the encryption key.

Reference-contexts: Despite this breakthrough, cryptographers reassured themselves with the thought of adding more digits to their codes. The problem of factoring numbers becomes exponentially harder the larger they are. However, Shor <ref> [10] </ref> outlined a quantum algorithm that would factorise RSA-129 in a few seconds, if a quantum computer could be built that ran as fast as a modern PC. <p> Further work is required to relate explicitly parallel computation with quantum-inspired computation. The aim of this paper is not to present a formal exposition of quantum-inspired genetic algorithms but to demonstrate the feasibility of such methods and the novelty of the paradigm. As Shor points out <ref> [10] </ref>, in addition to the complexity class NP (intuitively, the class of exponential search problems) there is the class PSPACE, which are those problems which can be solved with an amount of memory polynomial with respect to the input size, and the class BPP, which are problems which can be solved
