Reference-contexts: The optimization technique may be generally classified into two types: gradient based and non-gradient based methods. Gradient based methods usually require that the objective functions and constraints are smooth. Conventional gradient based methods generally introduce a line search to find the optimum. Gelsey et al <ref> [1] </ref> and Shukla et al [2] used a CFD solver with the gradient based line search optimizer CFSQP [3] to redesign two hypersonic inlets. A similar method has also been used for the design of 3D wings with nacelles [4] for a supersonic transport.

A similar method has also been used for the design of 3D wings with nacelles [4] for a supersonic transport. However, such approaches usually require a number of flow field computations proportional to the number of design variables to obtain the gradients. <p> Therefore, if we were only to rely on the gradient based optimum search procedure, it would likely converge to a non-global local optimum. We thus employed a Genetic Algorithm optimizer [15] and a multi start gradient line search optimizer CFSQP <ref> [3] </ref>. Both the optimizers use Random Probes to obtain the population and the start points.

A similar method has also been used for the design of 3D wings with nacelles <ref> [4] </ref> for a supersonic transport. However, such approaches usually require a number of flow field computations proportional to the number of design variables to obtain the gradients. The optimization would be extremely difficult with a large number of design variables due to the limitation of the computer power.

Reference-contexts: The optimization would be extremely difficult with a large number of design variables due to the limitation of the computer power. An alternative gradient approach based on control theory suggested by Jameson seems promising to overcome this difficulty <ref> [5] </ref>. This method uses the flow field governing equations as constraints and introduces the adjoint equations to make the gradient computation independent of the number of design variables. In principle, the true optimum can only be obtained with unlimited design variables.

Reference-contexts: In principle, the true optimum can only be obtained with unlimited design variables. The optimum approach procedure of control theory method is much more efficient than the line search methods. Control theory has been successfully used to design 2D and 3D wings and 3D wing/body junctions <ref> [6] </ref>. However, the line search method is simpler and the application is more straightforward as long as the geometry can be modeled without using too many design variables.

Reference-contexts: The non-gradient based methods (such as Genetic Al 2 gorithms (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA) and Random Probes (RP)) are more capable of treating a design space with discontinuities and approaching the global optimum. Ya-mamoto, Dervieux et al. have used Genetic Algorithms to optimize the design of airfoils <ref> [7] </ref> [8]. The disadvantage of the non-gradient based methods is that they are generally more CPU-intensive. A good strategy may be to use a non-gradient method to get close to the global optimum and then use a gradient method to reach the global optimum.

Reference-contexts: A good strategy may be to use a non-gradient method to get close to the global optimum and then use a gradient method to reach the global optimum. Aly et al. used such a method combining Simulated Annealing and a gradient optimizer for airfoil designs <ref> [9] </ref>. The optimization is switched to a gradient method from SA when it is near the possible global optimum using a criterion defined by Ogot and Alag [10]. Supersonic inlet design is a difficult task due to the complex flow physics and CPU re quirements.

Reference-contexts: We therefore employed a simple inlet analysis code, NAWC Inlet Design and Analysis Code (NIDA) in the optimization loop. NIDA was developed at United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) as an inlet analysis/design tool <ref> [11] </ref>. It uses a 2D aerodynamic model employing a method of characteristics for the supersonic flow section upstream of the throat, and empirical 1D correlations downstream of the throat for the region of the terminal shock wave/turbulent boundary layer interaction and subsonic diffuser. <p> Upstream of the throat, the curves are required to have continuous slopes at the connections. The duct is composed of entirely straight lines 4 downstream of the throat. The external cowl is formed by an ellipse which is considered to have low cowl wave drag <ref> [11] </ref>, and has been not optimized in this study. The inlet is required to start at Mach 2.6. The throat area is therefore computed to be able to swallow the normal shock at Mach 2.6 according to 1D physics [12, 11]. <p> The inlet is required to start at Mach 2.6. The throat area is therefore computed to be able to swallow the normal shock at Mach 2.6 according to 1D physics <ref> [12, 11] </ref>. With the initial cone angle and final external turning, the isentropic compression turning is known and the curve shape (a-b) is computed using the method of characteristics. The curve c-d is made by an ellipse if possible.

Reference-contexts: Since the total pressure of the inlet is the only object of the optimization at the current stage, the external cowl shape and therefore the cowl wave drag was kept unchanged. The external cowl shape was specified by UTRC <ref> [13] </ref>. The length of the inlet was also specified by UTRC. 3.1 Constraints All the constraints are nonlinear inequality constraints and are continuous as suggested in [14]. <p> When the back pressure is substantially higher than the critical back pressure, the propagation speed of the SS system is fast and the shock is quickly pushed out of the entrance as subcritical flow <ref> [13] </ref>. When the back pressure is approaching the critical value, the propagation speed of the SS system is very slow. This makes the computation particularly CPU time intensive.
