Abstract: We compare the ability of three exemplar-based memory models, each using three different face stimulus representations, to account for the probability a human subject responded old in an old/new facial memory experiment. The models are 1) the Generalized Context Model, 2) SimSample, a probabilistic sampling model, and 3) DBM, a novel model related to kernel density estimation that explicitly encodes stimulus distinctiveness. The representations are 1) positions of stimuli in MDS face space, 2) projections of test faces onto the eigenfaces of the study set, and 3) a representation based on response to a grid of Gabor filter jets. Of the 9 model/representation combinations, only the distinctiveness model in MDS space predicts the observed morph familiarity inversion effect, in which the subjects' false alarm rate for morphs between similar faces is higher than their hit rate for many of the studied faces. This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that human memory for faces is a kernel density estimation task, with the caveat that distinctive faces require larger kernels than do typical faces.

Reference-contexts: The results are consistent with the hypothesis that facial memory is a kernel density estimation <ref> (Bishop, 1995) </ref> task, except that distinctive exemplars require larger kernels. Also, on the basis of our model, we predict that distinctiveness with respect to the study set is the critical factor influencing kernel size, as opposed to a context-free notion of distinctiveness. <p> If we assume a Gaussian mixture model, in which the density surface is built from Gaussian blobs centered on each studied exemplar, the task is a form of kernel density estimation <ref> (Bishop, 1995) </ref>. We can formulate the task of predicting the human subjects' P (old) in this framework, then, as optimizing the priors and widths of the kernel functions to minimize the mean squared error of the prediction.

Reference-contexts: Many of the models researchers have proposed to account for data from explicit memory experiments fall into one of three gross categories based on the extent to which memories of the individual studied exemplars are distinct. Exemplar-based models, such as the Generalized Context Model (Nosofsky, 1986) and SAM <ref> (Gillund and Shiffrin, 1984) </ref>, rely on the assumption that subjects explicitly store representations of each of the stimuli they study. Superpositional models such as CHARM (Metcalfe Eich, 1982) posit that exemplar representations are blended into a composite memory trace. <p> SimSample Busey and Tunnicliff (submitted) invented SimSample in an attempt to remedy the GCM's poor predictions of the human data. It is related to both GCM, in that it uses representations in MDS space, and SAM <ref> (Gillund and Shiffrin, 1984) </ref>, in that it involves sampling exemplars.

Reference-contexts: In the MDS modeling results described below, we used the 6-dimensional vector associated with each stimulus as its representation. Principal component (eigenface) projections Eigenfaces, or the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix for a set of face images, are a common basis for face representations <ref> (e.g. Turk and Pentland, 1991) </ref>. We performed a principal components analysis on the 68 face images used in the study set for Busey and Tunnicliff's experiment to get the 67 non-zero eigenvectors of their covariance matrix.
