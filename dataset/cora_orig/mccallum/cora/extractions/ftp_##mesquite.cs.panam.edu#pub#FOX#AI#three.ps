Reference-contexts: Many works on abduction have shown the task to be relevant for problems in the areas of diagnosis, object identification, theory formation and so forth [6, 19, 17, 5, 2] It has been suggested by <ref> [1, 4, 3, 11, 18, 22] </ref> that perception is also an abductive problem. It has been further suggested that perception requires abductive reasoning over several levels of knowledge.

Reference-contexts: This list is then used during the abductive problem solving. The abducer for this level attempts to explain the gestures in terms of the phoneme hypotheses. For information on the Abductive problem solving, see <ref> [9, 8] </ref>. The abducer first attempts to explain the easily accountable findings. First, it looks for hypotheses which were considered confirmed based on the plausibility rating from the phoneme recognition agents.

Reference-contexts: This notion of abductive reasoning over several levels, which we call multi-layered abduction <ref> [13] </ref>, is a process in which the output of one level is composed of hypotheses attempting to explain the input at that level. These hypotheses then become the input to the next level. This continues until the highest levels achieve satisfactory solutions which account for the original data.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, if we see an alveolar movement in the data, then we can generate a hypothesis that an alveolar consonant was uttered. The data referred to is Microbeam X-ray data <ref> [20] </ref>. We can then attempt to explain the appearance of phonemes by hypothesizing words containing the set of phonemes. Thus, we have two abductive conclusions to make; first we abduce phonemes from gestures; we then abduce words from phonemes.

Reference-contexts: Articulatory Recognition We have chosen as a domain to implement the problem of reasoning from articulatory movements to the intended words which may have caused those movements <ref> [21] </ref> That is, we know what movements the vocal tract 2 must make in order to produce utterances (in English). Given such movements, we then reason about the possible utterances that are representative 1 If we say that speech recognition includes comprehension or understanding, then we include semantics and pragmatics.
