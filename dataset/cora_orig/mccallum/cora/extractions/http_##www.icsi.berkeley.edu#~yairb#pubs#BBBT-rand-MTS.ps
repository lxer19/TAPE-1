Title: A polylog(n)-competitive algorithm for metrical task systems  
Author: Yair Bartal Avrim Blum Carl Burch Andrew Tomkins 
Date: September 26, 1997  
Abstract: We present a randomized on-line algorithm for the Metrical Task System problem that achieves a competitive ratio of O(log 6 n) against an oblivious adversary, on any metric space. This is the first algorithm to achieve a sublinear competitive ratio for all metric spaces. Our algorithm uses a recent result of Bartal [Bar96] that an arbitrary metric space can be probabilistically approximated by a set of metric spaces called "k-hierarchical well-separated trees" (k-HST's). Indeed, the main technical result of this paper is an O(log 2 n)-competitive algorithm for (log 2 n)-HST spaces. This, combined with the result of [Bar96], yields the general bound. Note that for the k-server problem on metric spaces of k + c points our result implies a competitive ratio of O(c 6 log 6 k).

Reference-contexts: A long-standing conjecture maintains that the correct answer is fi (log n): that is, an on-line algorithm exists with competitive ratio O (log n) for every metric space, and there is no metric space for which one can guarantee o (log n). 1.1 The k-HST approximation Recently, Bartal <ref> [Bar96] </ref> made important progress by reducing the problem on general metric spaces to the problem on one particular type of space. He defines the following notion. <p> Theorem 1 invites developing strategies for a k-HST. Bartal <ref> [Bar96] </ref> does this using a variant of the the marking algorithm [FKL + 91] and achieves a competitive ratio of 2 O ( p for general metric spaces. <p> Notice that this ratio is polylogarithmic in n for poly (n)-diameter graphs. This is already an improvement on the result of <ref> [Bar96] </ref>. In the remainder of this paper, we show how to achieve a ratio polylogarithmic in n only, without restricting the class of metric spaces in any way. 11 4 Combining two regions 4.1 Strategy We wish to remove the appearance of in the ratio. <p> More specifically, the algorithm would probabilistically construct an (log 2 n)-HST space according to <ref> [Bar96] </ref> and then apply Strategy 3 for the HST. The algorithm for the original metric space uses the same states as the simulated HST algorithm. <p> This bound improves as the k-HST approximation ratio improves for specific metric spaces. In particular the results of <ref> [Bar96] </ref> imply that for weighted trees the ratio improves to O (rk log k n) = O (log 5 n= log log n). <p> For d-dimensional meshes we can achieve better bounds by approximating them using balanced k-HST spaces. An HST is called balanced if at every internal node the size of the subtrees rooted at this node are equal. Bartal <ref> [Bar96] </ref> shows that an r-competitive algorithm for balanced k-HST spaces implies a competitive ratio of O (rk log k n) for meshes.

That the strategy is w-based is obvious. <p> To do this, we need a method for carefully combining two spaces of unequal ratios. In this section we consider this problem of carefully combining two regions. For s = 1, the problem is one examined by Blum, Karloff, Rabani, and Saks <ref> [BKRS92] </ref>. (They were concerned with a metric space consisting of two spaces separated by a large distance. That paper was able to ignore the internal potential functions and additive constants by assuming the two spaces were sufficiently far apart.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Metrical Task System (MTS) problem, introduced by Borodin, Linial, and Saks <ref> [BLS92] </ref>, can be stated as follows. Consider a machine that can be in one of n states or configurations. This machine is given a sequence of tasks, where each task has an associated cost vector specifying the cost of performing the task in each state of the machine. <p> Specifically, we say that randomized algorithm A has competitive ratio r if, for some a, for all , E [c A ()] r c OPT () + a Borodin, Linial, and Saks <ref> [BLS92] </ref> present a deterministic on-line MTS algorithm that for any metric space achieves a competitive ratio of 2n 1 and prove that this is optimal for deterministic algorithms (in a strong sense: namely, there is no metric space for which a deterministic algorithm can guarantee a better ratio). <p> Irani and Seiden [IS95] present a randomized algorithm that for arbitrary spaces achieves a competitive ratio of roughly 1:58n. Two types of lower bounds are known for randomized MTS algorithms. For certain specific metric spaces such as the uniform space <ref> [BLS92] </ref>, and the superincreasing space [KRR91], there are (log n) bounds on the competitive ratio of any randomized on-line algorithm. More generally, a weaker lower bound of (log log n) [KRR91], subsequently improved to ( p log n= log log n) [BKRS92], applies to every metric space.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, this assumption can be viewed as a preprocessor to the algorithm. For a point i in the metric space, let w i denote the optimal off-line cost of ending in state i after servicing all tasks so far. (This is sometimes called the work function <ref> [CL91] </ref>.) Given a task (i; ffi), the value of w j for j 6= i does not change, and w i becomes minfw i + ffi; min j6=i w j + d ij g, where d ij is the distance between i and j.

Reference-contexts: As noted in Section 7, some of the key ingredients to this result have other interesting implications as well. The MTS problem is related to the k-server problem introduced by Manasse, McGeoch, and Sleator <ref> [MMS90] </ref>. In particular, a k-server problem on k + c points can be expressed as a k+c state MTS problem in which each state represents a configuration of the servers.

Reference-contexts: This scenario is a generalization of the aptly named "unfair two state problem" of Seiden <ref> [Sei96] </ref>. While the primary goal in developing algorithms for this scenario is to optimize the competitive ratio, our secondary goal is to limit the maximum value of the potential function used by the algorithm. <p> Because we cannot afford to assume the spaces are so separated, we must be more careful and introduce s &gt; 1.) By appropriately modifying the technique used in that paper, we get a strategy for Scenario 1 with two regions. (Seiden <ref> [Sei96] </ref> independently developed the same algorithm.
