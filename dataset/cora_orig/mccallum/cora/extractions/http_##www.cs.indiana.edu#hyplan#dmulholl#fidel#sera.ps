In the same period more was learned about the treatment of certain characters outside of Amharic that allowed for simplification of the ASCII representation. The following is a recapitulation of the original publication and an assessment of some of the more recent developments. As we have indicated before, this system, though well developed, is still not in its final form. Further refinements will only come after many have had the chance to use it and test its strengths and weaknesses on their own. As the SERA system, joined now by a long awaited Unicode [7] domain assignement, work together to advance Ethiopic information processing we keep in mind the words of Abraham Demoz (1925 - 1994), to whom we have dedicated this work [2]:
