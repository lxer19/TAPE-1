Abstract: We show simple constant-round interactive proof systems for problems capturing the approx imability, to within a factor of p n, of optimization problems in integer lattices; specifically, the closest vector problem (CVP), and the shortest vector problem (SVP). These interactive proofs are for the "coNP direction"; that is, we give an interactive protocol showing that a vector is "far" from the lattice (for CVP), and an interactive protocol showing that the shortest-lattice-vector is "long" (for SVP). Furthermore, these interactive proof systems are Honest-Verifier Perfect Zero-Knowledge. We conclude that approximating CVP (resp., SVP) within a factor of p

Reference-contexts: point c in L of minimum length (where `length' is measured with respect to a variety of norms). 1 The SVP problem has been known to be NP-hard in l 1 (cf., [40]), and recently proved by Ajtai to be NP-hard (under randomized reductions) for the Euclidean l 2 norm <ref> [2] </ref>. Even more recently, Micciancio [36] has proven that it is NP-Hard (again under randomized reductions) to approximate the Shortest Vector Problem in l 2 -norm to within any constant factor smaller than p 2. <p> Interestingly, the trapdoor permutation suggested in [19] relies on the conjectured difficulty of the Closest Vector Problem. On the other hand, GapCVP 2 log 1* n is quasi-NP-hard [6], and GapSVP p 2* is NP-hard <ref> [2, 36] </ref>, for any * &gt; 0. An immediate question which arises is whether the security of a cryptographic system can be based on the difficulty of GapCVP g (n) or GapSVP g (n) for a function g for which these approximation problems are NP-hard (or, say, quasi-NP-hard).

Reference-contexts: Thus, the statistical distance between ~ 0 and ~ 1 is bounded by n 2c + 1 3 n 2c (where the extra n 2c term comes from Item 1 above). The soundness claim follows. 2.2 Conclusion Combining the above protocol with known transformations (i.e., [24] and <ref> [7] </ref>), we get Theorem 1 The promise problem GapCVP p n=O (log n) is in N P " coAM. Furthermore, the comple ment of GapCVP p n=O (log n) has a HVPZK constant-round proof system.

Furthermore, the comple ment of GapSVP p n=O (log n) has a HVPZK constant-round proof system. Again, the interesting part is the membership of GapSVP p n in coAM. <p> Here we use the hypothesis that the reduction is smart (which implies that the prover can always succeed in case x 2 L). We stress that all these AM-proofs are run in parallel, and so the result is an MAM-proof system (which can be converted into an AM-proof system <ref> [7] </ref>). In case of a randomized (smart) reduction, we let the verifier select the random input (to the reduction) and continue as above. Corollary 6 If either GapCVP p n or GapSVP p n is N P-hard via smart reductions then coN P AM.

Reference-contexts: An improved bound of O (n) was obtained by H-astad [27] and Banaszczyk <ref> [8] </ref>, using dual lattices. 1 The Shortest Vector Problem (SVP). The SVP problem was formulated by Dirichlet in 1842. <p> That is, we'll show that very-far instances (no-instances) are always accepted, whereas close instances (yes-instances) are accepted with negligible probability. Specifically, we show that Theorem 1.1 GapCVP p n=O (log n) is in coAM. Recall that by <ref> [33, 27, 8] </ref>, GapCVP n is in coN P. Thus, we have placed a potentially harder problem (i.e., referring to smaller gaps) in a potentially bigger class (i.e., coN P coAM).

Reference-contexts: This seems to indicate that it will be impossible to show an NP-Hardness type result for approximation factor p n. In particular, unless coN P AM (which in particular would collapse the Polynomial-Time Hierarchy <ref> [10] </ref>), such a result cannot be proven via a (randomized) many-to-one/Karp reduction. Furthermore, one would need to use a Turing/Cook reduction which makes queries outside of the promise for further discussion see Section 5. <p> The reasoning was that a reduction (even a Cook reduction) of N P to GI would imply that coN P is in AM, and thus that the Polynomial-Time Hierarchy collapses <ref> [10] </ref>. We have to be more careful when promise problems are concerned. If N P is Karp-reducible to GapCVP p n (or to any promise problem in N P " coAM) then it follows that coN P AM.

Reference-contexts: A claim of impossiblity is commonly attributed to Brassard. However, what Brassard actually showed <ref> [11, Thm. 2, Item (2)ii] </ref> can be stated as follows 9 Unfortunately, the term "non-smart" is somewhat misleading to be non-smart (in an essential way) and yet work the reduction must be quite "clever".

Reference-contexts: The work of Lagarias et. al. [33] implies that polynomial-size proofs exist that can be verified in polynomial-time that a vector c in the lattice is within factor n of the shortest vector in the lattice. An alternative proof was suggested by Cai <ref> [12] </ref>. 1.2 New Results: Short Interactive Proofs for approximate CVP and SVP Hardness of approximation results for an optimization problem are typically shown by reducing some hard problem (e.g., an NP-hard language) to a promise problem 2 related to the approximation of . <p> The problem is to distinguish the case when v is the shortest vector of L (b) from the case it is not.

Reference-contexts: the above procedure generates random lattice points in a distribution which is at most poly (n) 2 n away from the uniform distribution over L (B) " H. * How to uniformly select a point in the unit sphere?

Lagarias et. al. <ref> [33] </ref> showed, using reductions to the problem of computing Korkine-Zolotarev bases, that polynomial-size proofs exist that can be verified in polynomial-time that a vector c is within factor n 1:5 of the closest (to t) lattice vector. <p> No known results on hardness of approximation for SVP are known. The problem of verifying the "approximate optimality" of a solution to the SVP problem has also been considered.
