Abstract: Digital video services, scientific visualization and other multimedia applications require delivery of high network throughput to end user applications. In this paper we identify bottlenecks in the data path between high-speed networks and applications. Using performance of multimedia applications as a metric, the effectiveness of solutions to reduce network, operating system, and user bottlenecks is explored experimentally.

Reference-contexts: Historically, switching logic and interconnect components were expensive thereby limiting their use in systems. However, progress in silicon and packaging technology has changed the relative cost of interconnections and now it is possible to build general purpose computer systems based on switched bus architectures <ref> [1] </ref>. In this context, the data path used to derive Equation 1 no longer holds since in the case of these architectures, many paths can be used simultaneously to improve performance.

Reference-contexts: It is worthwhile noting that an individual application will benefit from an increase in network bandwidth, but this is not necessarily true when multiple traffic streams are competing for the available bandwidth. In this case, bandwidth allocation schemes <ref> [2] </ref> [22] are required for guaranteed performance. We do not discuss these issues here, however, since this is not the topic of this paper. Operating system: A UNIX kernel that supports single-copy TCP/IP has been used. This allows direct data copy from the network to the application.

Reference-contexts: In this context, we note that without careful tuning, data display by the X server can degrade performance in the final delivery of information to the user. Our choice was to use the X shared memory extensions <ref> [3] </ref> in order to speed up image display. The usual way to display an image is to use the X11 library call XPutImage () on an application's data.

Reference-contexts: Afterburner is the host interface; the other card, Jetstream, is the link adapter. The shared memory present on the Afterburner board enables the support of single-copy implementations of network protocols such as TCP/IP and UDP/IP. Further details of Afterburner and Jetstream are given in [21] and <ref> [4] </ref>. The hardware architecture of the host is illustrated in Figure 2. The Standard Graphics Connector (SGC) [5] is the system bus used on the HP 9000 Series 700 workstation and has a maximum data transfer rate of a Gbit/s.

Reference-contexts: This has made existing operating systems become a bottleneck in end systems. Well-known overheads include data copying, network protocol processing, context switches, and interrupts [13] [19] [16]. Several techniques have been proposed and implemented to avoid these overheads [7] <ref> [6] </ref> [10] [18]. In this work, we minimized data copying by using a UNIX kernel which supports single-copy TCP/IP, a modified version of TCP/IP. Throughout this paper, we refer to two-copy TCP/IP as the standard version that normally comes with UNIX operating systems.

Reference-contexts: However, it is only possible to achieve a maximum of 400 Mbit/s transfer rate by the CPU between memory and input/output (I/O) space (e.g. graphics devices or network interface) <ref> [8] </ref>. A principal feature of the hardware architecture is the memory and system bus controller chip which connects the CPU to memory and the I/O system components. The system bus controller chip communicates to the SGC bus via two system bus interface chips.

Reference-contexts: Overall performance for multiple applications To quantify the impact of running both video and visualization applications on overall performance, we used the following metrics: CPU usage, frame rate (visualization application), and percentage of frames dropped (video application). CPU usage was measured using Glance <ref> [9] </ref>, a performance monitor tool that comes with standard HP-UX operating system. Table II summarizes the results obtained using the Jetstream network. All tests have been performed on a kernel that supports single-copy TCP/IP. For the visualization application, we used a socket buffer size of 256 KByte.

Reference-contexts: However, in the case of a single-copy TCP/IP implementation we use for our experiments in this paper, there is only one data copy between network and application thereby eliminating the copy to kernel buffer. Moreover, the single-copy implementation of TCP also supports RFC 1323 window scaling <ref> [11] </ref>, and is capable of calculating checksum during data movement. It is not easy to come up with general techniques to increase throughput at the application level. The main reason is that different applications have different requirements and each is implemented in its own way.

Reference-contexts: In the case of FDDI, an EISA FDDI adapter designed for HP 9000/700 EISA systems was used to attach to an FDDI network. Performance measurements were made with a tool called netperf <ref> [12] </ref> which measures the transfer of data from a producer process (generating the data) to a consumer (receiving data) running on a remote machine. The maximum network data bandwidths for Ethernet, FDDI, and Jetstream are 10 Mbit/s, 100 Mbit/s, and 800 Mbit/s respectively.

Reference-contexts: However, raw data does not identify other bottlenecks that are normally associated with actual applications such as the presentation of information (e.g. video display in a window) or the effect of running multiple applications concurrently. Related work undertaken by other researchers in similar areas include: Keller et al. <ref> [14] </ref> showed the effectiveness of shared memory in the delivery of digital video to user applications. However, no optimization was attempted at either operating system or network layers, which led to poor overall application performance due to various protocol and system overheads (e.g. data copying).

Reference-contexts: A possible solution is to transfer data directly from a network device to the frame buffer over the system bus, a mechanism commonly referred as kernel-level streaming <ref> [15] </ref>. Unfortunately, the SGC bus implementation in the machines used for our experiments does not allow the needed slave-slave bus transactions.

Reference-contexts: This makes direct display by the X server possible without requiring any further manipulation. The user interface to the visualization application supports simple operations such as play, stop, and rewind. The video application uses the PowerVideo700 hardware video codec (compression / decompression) from Parallax <ref> [17] </ref> which supports Motion-JPEG. Motion-JPEG applies JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group, a standardized image compression technique for still images) to individual frames of a video sequence. The video board is capable of handling high quality video at 30 frames per second in real-time during either recording or playback sessions.
