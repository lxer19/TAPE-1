Reference-contexts: There is a great variety of such results, we mention only some of them.

We also mention a n O (log n) -algorithm for tournaments (directed graphs with exactly one arc between any two distinct vertices) [BL]. <p> Given a coloured graph the cellular algebra W () can be constructed in polynomial time. This observation reduces the ISO to the problem of constructing the group Aut (W ) where W is a cellular algebra. Throughout the paper we deal exceptionally with this problem. In <ref> [BGM] </ref> a n O (k) -isomorphism test for the class of all undirected n-vertex graphs with eigenvalue multiplicity bounded by k was described. The question arises: whether the upper bound can be improved by pulling k out of the exponent.

Reference-contexts: The computation complexity status of the ISO is unknown at present and the best general isomorphism test for n-vertex graphs runs in time n O ( p (see <ref> [BKL] </ref>). It is well-known that the ISO is polynomial-time equivalent to the problem of finding the automorphism group Aut () of a graph consisting of all isomorphisms from to itself.

Reference-contexts: There exist polynomial-time algorithms for graphs with bounded degree [L] and for graphs with bounded eigenvalue multiplicity [BGM]. We also mention a n O (log n) -algorithm for tournaments (directed graphs with exactly one arc between any two distinct vertices) <ref> [BL] </ref>. Below under a coloured graph we mean an ordered triple = (V; E; c) where V is a finite vertex set, E ae V fi V is an edge set and c is a colouring function on E. <p> Let g 2 Sym (V ) and W be a class of cellular algebras on V closed under &lt; g; G &gt;-isomorphisms. Following <ref> [BL] </ref> we define for W the notion of canonical labeling with respect to the coset gG. <p> We associate with W the map s = s (W ) : V fi V ! [1; l] where s (u; v) is the label of the basis relation of W g containing (u; v) (such maps will be called strings on V fi V ). Following <ref> [BL] </ref> we reduce the canonization problem for W with respect to gG to that one for the class S W = fs (W )j W 2 Wg of strings on V fi V with respect to the group G 0 Sym (V fi V ) coinciding with the natural action of <p> Now by (*) we conclude that [H 0 : sol (H 0 )] t 2 . Following <ref> [BL] </ref> the canonization problem for strings of S W can in polynomial time be reduced to the case of a transitive group G 0 . In this case the above argument shows that [G 0 : sol (G 0 )] t 2 . Let G 0 be transitive. <p> Let G 0 be transitive. Construct the group H = sol (G 0 ) and a decomposition G 0 = j=1 of G 0 into a disjoint union of cosets. By [KL] it can be done in time n O (1) . Apply the algorithm of <ref> [BL] </ref> to find for a string s 2 S W the group A (s; H), a canonical labeling h with respect to H and a canonical labeling h j with respect to the coset g j H for all j. <p> Take h j 0 as a canonical labeling of s with respect to G 0 . The canonicity of the algorithm follows from that of <ref> [BL] </ref>. Since H is a solvable group, finding h, h j and A (s; H) can be done in time n O (1) . Besides, by condition (*) r t 2 . Thus A (s; G 0 ) can be constructed in time (t 2 n) O (1) . <p> Input: a cellular algebra W on V . 13 Output: the group Aut (W ) and a canonical labeling of W . Step 1. Let W have at least two cells, Cel (W ) = fV 1 ; : : : ; V s g; s &gt; 1. Following <ref> [BL] </ref> reduce the canonization problem with respect to Sym (V ) to that one with respect to Q s i=1 Sym (V i ).

Reference-contexts: Since J (k) = k O (k 2 = log 2 k) (see <ref> [CR] </ref>), the running time of our algorithm is bounded by (e k 2 n) O (1) . In other words the algorithm is polynomial not only for small k but also for k = O ( p As a corollary we give the following answer to the above question. <p> By Jordan's theorem J (k) &lt; +1 for all k (see <ref> [CR] </ref>). 4 The case of a primitive cellular algebra Here we prove Theorem 3 for primitive cellular algebras.

Reference-contexts: In the class of all cellular algebras W on n points with irreducible representation multiplicity bounded by k a canonical labeling and the automorphism group of W can be found in time f (k) n O (1) where f (k) is defined in Theorem 1. Remark. It follows from <ref> [E] </ref> that the class of cellular algebras described above is recognizable in time n O (1) . The proof of the MAIN THEOREM for a primitive W is given in section 4.

Reference-contexts: This implies that [G : sol (G)] J (k) log 2 k for each transitive constituent G of Aut (W ) where sol (G) is the solvable radical of G and J (k) is Jordan's function (see <ref> [EP] </ref>). Thus the problem is reduced to permutation group computation with solvable groups. The paper consists of five sections.

Reference-contexts: As usual the automorphism group Aut () of is by definition the group of all permutations of V preserving each color. One of the oldest approaches to the ISO is due to Weisfeiler and Lehman (see <ref> [W] </ref>). <p> The restriction of this action to W defines a faithful linear representation W stand : W ! End (L V ) 4 called the standard representation of W . It is completely reducible over C due to the fact that W is a semisimple algebra (see <ref> [W] </ref>). Since W is closed under the Hadamard multiplication, it has a uniquely determined linear space basis R = R (W ) consisting of f0,1g-matrices such that X R = J V and R 2 R , R T 2 R where R T is the transpose of R. <p> The set of all of them is denoted by Cel (W ). For each R 2 R there exist uniquely determined integers i; j 2 [1; s] (depending on R) such that R ae V i fi V j . It is well-known (see <ref> [W] </ref>) that the number of 1's in the uth row (resp. vth column) of the matrix R does not depend on u 2 V i (resp. v 2 V j ). This number is denoted by d out (R) (resp. d in (R)). <p> We say that W is primitive if the only equivalences belonging to W are I V and J V . Otherwise, W is called imprimitive. Up to the language this definition coincides with that of <ref> [W] </ref>. The set of all cellular algebras on V is ordered by inclusion. The algebra Mat V is obviously the greatest element of the set. We write W W 0 if W is a subalgebra of W 0 . <p> It is denoted by W [A 1 ; : : : ; A m ]. It is known (see <ref> [W] </ref>) that the standard basis of this algebra can be constructed in polynomial time from W and A 1 ; : : : ; A m . <p> Clearly, given W and E the standard basis of W=E can be constructed in polynomial time. Remark. When each equivalence class modulo E is contained in a cell of W the notion of cellular factoralgebra was introduced in <ref> [W] </ref>. Our definition coincides with that of [W] in this case and can be viewed as its generalization. The following statement is straightforward from definitions. <p> Clearly, given W and E the standard basis of W=E can be constructed in polynomial time. Remark. When each equivalence class modulo E is contained in a cell of W the notion of cellular factoralgebra was introduced in <ref> [W] </ref>. Our definition coincides with that of [W] in this case and can be viewed as its generalization. The following statement is straightforward from definitions. Lemma 2.1 Let W be a cellular algebra on V , U be a union of cells of W and E 2 W be an equivalence on V . <p> Given a cellular algebra W on V and A 2 Mat V , we put in order the set of the basis relations of the algebra W [A] according to Weisfeiler-Lehman's canonical algorithm, so that the following holds (see <ref> [W] </ref>, Ch.M): (W-L) if g 2 Sym (V ) is an isomorphism from W to W 0 and A g = A 0 , then g is also an isomorphism from W [A] to W 0 [A 0 ]. <p> Step 5. Output G as Aut (W ) and h as a canonical labeling of W . Let us prove the correctness of the above algorithm. It follows from the primitivity of W that the graph (V; R) is strongly connected (see <ref> [W] </ref>). Thus S 6= ;. Besides, it is clear from Step 4 that G Aut (W ). Let g 2 Aut (W ). Then from the definition of S at Step 2 and (W-L) we conclude that s = s g 0 2 S. <p> Then m (W ()) m (A i ) for all i. Thus by the hypothesis of the theorem m (W ()) min m (A i ) = m () k: Now Theorem 1 follows from Theorem 3, since Aut () = Aut (W ()) (see <ref> [W] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: In this case the multiplicities of irreducible representations of W in its standard representation coincide with the degrees of irreducible representations of the subalgebra of Mat V centralizing W (see <ref> [We] </ref>). This implies that the degree of each irreducible representation of the group G entering its standard permutation representation is bounded by k. So the hypothesis of Proposition 3.1 is satisfied for t = J (k) log 2 k by the following result.
