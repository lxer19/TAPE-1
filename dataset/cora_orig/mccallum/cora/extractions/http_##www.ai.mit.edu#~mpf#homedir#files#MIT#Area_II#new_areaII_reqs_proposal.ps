Abstract: Most significant changes proposed in this document revolve around the breadth requirement. Currently, the breadth requirement is embodied in the core classes. In this proposal, we remove the emphasis on classes and embody the breadth requirement in a collection of syllabi. We propose to individualize courses of study for satisfying the breadth requirement. To this end, we propose an Academic Committee for each student as the mechanism for ensuring maximum flexibility. Finally, we describe an Area II Immigration Course. We believe that together these changes streamline and focus the process for obtaining a PhD without compromising the standards of the graduate program.

Reference-contexts: Little time is spent discussing proposed requirements where they do not differ from the current ones. Therefore, readers should be familiar with those requirements, particularly the core course requirements. For a complete discussion of the current Area II requirements, see <ref> [9] </ref>. For reference, we have provided a brief comparison between the requirements proposed here and recent requirements in Section 5. This document has two major goals. The most obvious is to outline a particular proposal for requirements for the graduate program in Area II.
