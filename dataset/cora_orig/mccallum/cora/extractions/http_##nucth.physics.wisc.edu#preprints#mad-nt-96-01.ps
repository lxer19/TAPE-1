Abstract: We consider the effect on matter-enhanced neutrino flavor transformation of a randomly fluctuating, delta-correlated matter density. The fluctuations will produce a distribution of neutrino survival probabilities. We find the mean and variance of the distribution for the case of solar neutrinos, and discuss the possibility of placing a limit on solar density fluctuations using neutrino data.

A general treatment of fluctuations is presented in Section 2. <p> In Section 5, we discuss the results and present conclusions. 2 2 General Treatment of Fluctuation We will be concerned with systems whose evolution is described by the Schrodinger-like equation i @t where is represented as a column vector. Following the method of Loreti and Balantekin <ref> [7] </ref>, we define the density matrix = y (2) and divide H into two parts, one with known time dependence and one which fluctuates with time: H (t) = H 0 (t) + B (t)M; (3) where B (t) is a c-number and the operator M does not depend on time. <p> Then we have the following result for the evolution of fluctuation-averaged (cf. Eq. (16) of Ref. <ref> [7] </ref>): @t MSW conversion between neutrino flavors obeys the equation i @t -e ! m 2 sin 2 ((t) cos 2) -e ! where (t) = p m 2 N e (t); (10) is the vacuum neutrino mixing angle, m 2 is the difference in the squared masses of the two <p> We may then use the formalism of Section 2 with H 0 = z A (t) + x B; M = z ; (16) where we have defined A (t) 4E m 2 sin 2: (17) Then <ref> [7] </ref> we have the result @ 0 @ x 1 A = 2 B 0 0 B B A (t) k C 0 @ x 1 A (18) where k 2hfi 2 it; (19) and e -e i 1 -e i -e i: (20) The condition of Eq. (7) now becomes <p> For smaller angles, there is some effect in the non-adiabatic region, but the greatest effect is still in the adiabatic region. In the adiabatic region, for survival probabilities greater than 1=2, fluctuations tend to enhance the transition. This has been explained <ref> [7] </ref> by appealing to the flatness of the Bahcall-Pinsonnealt density profile near the center. Neutrinos in this region do not go through the resonance point, but do go through part of the resonance region. <p> both cases, and both have the same numerical value of final density before the truncation to zero. (In any case, the step should have no effect, since the density at the edge of the sun is much less than the resonant density.) 4 Higher Moments The formalism developed in Ref. <ref> [7] </ref> may be used to calculate higher moments of the distribution of survival probabilities.
