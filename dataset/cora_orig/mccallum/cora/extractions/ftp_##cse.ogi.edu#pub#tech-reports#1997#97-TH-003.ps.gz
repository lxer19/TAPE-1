Reference-contexts: The outputs of the ANN correspond to the phonetic units of the task. For the male/female task the net has only six outputs. For the 58-word task, a context-dependent net with sub-phoneme units <ref> (Barnard, Cole, Fanty, and Vermeulen 1995) </ref> was used. These units correspond to separate phoneme states in a hidden Markov model (HMM) context-dependent phoneme model. There were several hundred outputs. Section 4.1.2 describes a similar recognizer that is a successor to this one.

Reference-contexts: The task is to discriminate between the true words and other words falsely recognized. In particular, the question would be put: "What is your sex, male or female?" When answered with either of those two words, the recognizer has an accuracy of 98.8%. However in an actual census study <ref> (Cole, Novick, Fanty, Vermeulen, Sutton, Burnett, and Schalkwyk 1994) </ref> 1.6% of the utterances did not contain either target word. The goal is to reject such non-target utterances. This is open-set out-of-voacbulary rejection. <p> All speech data in this experiment are from the OGI Census corpus <ref> (Cole, Fanty, Noel, and Lander 1994) </ref>. Gender utterances and last name utterances were used. <p> 30% were the word "male." The last name utterances consist of responses to the prompt "Please say your last name." 3.3.1 Baseline System The baseline system was a frame-based ANN recognizer for the two words "male" and "female." This recognizer was developed for and used in the OGI Census system <ref> (Cole, Novick, Fanty, Vermeulen, Sutton, Burnett, and Schalkwyk 1994) </ref>. When in-vocabulary utterances are used, the baseline system's accuracy is 99.5%.

Reference-contexts: PLP coefficients are introduced and defined in Hermansky (1990). bootstrap: A procedure for estimating the statistical properties of some measurement <ref> (Efron and Tibshirani 1993) </ref>. In this thesis it is used to estimate the variance of the equal error rate of a verification algorithm. trial: In this thesis a trial is a recognition attempt, with its accompanying confidence and rejection computations. <p> It is defined as the equal error rate of the original raw scores before bootstrapping (see below) is performed. s x is the standard deviation of the mean, which is the square root of the variance of the bootstrap estimates. bootstrap iterations: The bootstrap procedure <ref> (Efron and Tibshirani 1993) </ref> is a statistical method for estimating the variance of quantities that may otherwise be hard to evaluate. Briefly the procedure involves treating the sample as though it were a population, and repeatedly drawing same-size samples from it (with replacement). <p> Because of the way the EER, MVE, and FOM are constructed it is difficult to give a closed-form specification of the variance. Instead statistical bootstrapping <ref> (Efron and Tibshirani 1993) </ref> is used to estimate variances and evaluate the difference in performance of two algorithms. Bootstrap parameter estimation is performed as follows.

Reference-contexts: Speech analysis is seventh order Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP) analysis <ref> (Hermansky 1990) </ref>, which yields eight coefficients per frame including energy. The analysis window is 10 msec and the frame increment (shift) is 6 msec. The inputs to the ANN are 56 PLP coefficients from a 160 msec window around the frame to be classified. <p> The outputs are listed in Table 4.2. The inputs are eight values from each 4.2 Performing One Experiment 49 of seven frames centered at the frame to be classified, and one additional input hardwired to 1.0. The eight values are the seventh-order PLP <ref> (Hermansky 1990) </ref> coefficients and one measure of energy. The recognizer was trained using the OGI Stories corpus, the OGI Yes/No corpus, and the NYNEX PhoneBook corpus.

Reference-contexts: This can be justified on the basis that humans may use short-term memory to re-parse an utterance that was not initially understood. Phonological Rules: It would be interesting to use phonological rules <ref> (as in Oshika, Zue, Weeks, Neu, and Aurbach 1975) </ref> to modify the standardized pronunciation from a Text-to-Speech system so that it more properly represents the variety in pronunciations to be expected.

Reference-contexts: Two performance statistics are presented: the MVE (minimum point on the TVE curve) and the EER (the cross-over point on the Type I and Type II curves). The Type I error rate <ref> (defined for example in Spence, Cotton, Underwood, and Duncan 1992) </ref> is the proportion of true word scores that would be rejected at that threshold. It is also called the ff error. The Type II error rate is the proportion of impostor word scores that would be accepted at that threshold.
