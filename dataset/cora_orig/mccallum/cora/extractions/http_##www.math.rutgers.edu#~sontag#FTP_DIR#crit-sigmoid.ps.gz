Title: Critical Points for Least-Squares Problems Involving Certain Analytic Functions, with Applications to Sigmoidal Nets  
Author: Eduardo D. Sontag 
Address: New Brunswick, NJ 08903  
Affiliation: Department of Mathematics Rutgers University,  
Abstract: This paper deals with nonlinear least-squares problems involving the fitting to data of parameterized analytic functions. For generic regression data, a general result establishes the countability, and under stronger assumptions finiteness, of the set of functions giving rise to critical points of the quadratic loss function. In the special case of what are usually called "single-hidden layer neural networks," which are built upon the standard sigmoidal activation tanh(x) (or equivalently (1 + e x ) 1 ), a rough upper bound for this cardinality is provided as well.

Reference-contexts: In conclusion, being a -analytic subset is the same as being a countable union of semianalytic subsets (or of compact semianalytic subsets). We will use the following very special consequence of general stratification theorems (see for example Theorem 9.2 in [18], as well as <ref> [2] </ref>): Fact A.1 Let M and N be analytic manifolds and f : M ! N an analytic mapping. Assume that Z is a compact semianalytic subset of M .

Reference-contexts: remarked that, even for extremely simple cases (such as K=1 and supposing that the inputs are binary vectors) there arise critical points associated to non-global local minima, and thus the study of the set of critical points of E (u;y) has been frequently put forward as a research topic; see <ref> [3, 4, 8, 14, 17] </ref>. In this context it has also been observed many times that |as with other least-squares problems| pathological behavior will depend heavily on the training sets not being in "general position" in appropriate senses of probability or topological density (cf. [4, 8, 14]).

Reference-contexts: Related notions appear also in automata theory and sequential machines (cf. <ref> [5] </ref>), though in both the cases of computational learning theory and automata, the emphasis is on discrete sets and combinatorics, as opposed to analytic parameterizations. 2 The next result provides a simple upper bound on the size needed for (universal) distinguishing subsets.
