Abstract: We investigate some aspects of cognition involved in invention, more precisely in the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell. We propose the use of the Structure-Behavior-Function (SBF) language for the representation of invention knowledge; we claim that because SBF has been shown to support a wide range of reasoning about physical devices, it constitutes a plausible account of how an inventor might represent knowledge of an invention. We further propose the use of the ACT-R architecture for the implementation of this model. ACT-R has been shown to very precisely model a wide range of human cognition. We draw upon the architecture for execution of productions and matching of declarative knowledge through spreading activation. Thus we present a model which combines the well-established cognitive validity of ACT-R with the powerful, specialized model-based reasoning methods facilitated by SBF.

Reference-contexts: But to investigate, as closely as possible to human cognition, the memory issues during the invention of the microphone, we also decided to experiment with the rich memory mechanisms provided by ACT-R <ref> (Anderson, 1993) </ref> and let ACT-R's architecture guide the memory processing involved in the invention of the microphone. 2 model which instantiates this analysis. Our model gets a func tion specification of transforming speech (i.e., a substance 3 of type sound) into an electric current (i.e., a substance of type electricity).

Reference-contexts: In contrast, the SBF language has been shown to directly support diverse and challenging design capabilities. Among these are case-based design (e.g., Kritik and Kritik2, Goel 1989; Goel et al., 1997) analogical transfer using generic abstractions <ref> (e.g., IDeAL, Bhatta et al., 1994) </ref>, natural language understanding in the domain of device design (e.g., KA, Goel et al., 1996b) explanation of design process and products (e.g., Interactive Kritik, Goel et al., 1996a), creative design (e.g., ALEC, Sim-ina & Kolodner 1997) and conceptual change in scientific theory formation (e.g., ToRQUE,

Reference-contexts: The example analyzed here is a small piece relevant to the work being done in ALEC (Simina & Kolodner, 1997; Simina et al., 1998), ToRQUE (Griffith et al., 1996; Griffith & Murdock, 1998), and NICOLE <ref> (Francis and Ram, 1997) </ref>. By modeling this example in ACT-R we are able to examine the issues of activation and retrieval in great depth. This analysis is potentially of great benefit to understanding the role of memory phenomena in analogy and other reasoning processes.

Reference-contexts: In the language of ACT-R, we are examining analogy over interconnected collections of chunks while the built in analogy mechanism is interested in analogy over individual productions. In fact, the particular task that we are addressing is very similar to the task addressed in SME <ref> (Gentner, 1983) </ref>. SME also performs an analogical transfer of small portions of complex interrelated knowledge elements.

Reference-contexts: Bell, 1908)... The first paragraph of the above description emphasizes the structure of the phonautograph, while the second paragraph emphasizes its behavior. From this and other similar examples, we argue that Bell's reasoning can be modeled used the Structure-Behavior-Function (SBF) device representation <ref> (Goel et al., 1997) </ref> to reason about physical devices. Elsewhere we have proposed a full computational architecture for modeling creative design, and in particular Bell's inventions (Simina and Kolodner, 1997; Simina et al., 1998), by relying on the SBF representation of artifacts.

Reference-contexts: abstractions (e.g., IDeAL, Bhatta et al., 1994), natural language understanding in the domain of device design (e.g., KA, Goel et al., 1996b) explanation of design process and products (e.g., Interactive Kritik, Goel et al., 1996a), creative design (e.g., ALEC, Sim-ina & Kolodner 1997) and conceptual change in scientific theory formation <ref> (e.g., ToRQUE, Griffith et al., 1996) </ref>. This is clearly a broad and interesting set of domains and problems. Thus we argue that SBF languages provide a plausible account of design reasoning, and we consider it to be a close approximation of an abstract form of human knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Namely, the retrieval of the phonautograph probably was not based on its function, but on its internal behavior <ref> (Simina & Kolodner, 1995) </ref>. Note that the retrieval of the phonautograph, as a source, is a prerequisite for analogy. Let's also consider Bell's description of the phonautograph: The phonautograph consisted essentially of a stretched membrane, in front of which was arranged a conical mouth-piece, into which a person could speak.
