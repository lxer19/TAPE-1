Title: Closed-Loop Calibration of the TREADPORT  
Author: Godmar Back 
Note: Some possible ways to do this are discussed at the end of the paper.  
Date: March 11, 1996  
Abstract: This write-up describes a closed-loop calibration mechanism for the TREADPORT , a virtual-reality device manufactured by Sarcos. The calibration procedure uses a length constraint imposed upon the endpoint, resulting in only one equation per pose. It is shown that while the simulation yields encouraging results, other problems have to be overcome before the procedure can be made to work in practice.

The procedure tends to find the trivial solution in which k 3 = 0 and the DH parameters are completely off. Therefore, we decided to assume that the gains are known.
