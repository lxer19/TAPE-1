Abstract: To operate in the real-world, intelligent agents constantly need to absorb new information, and to consider the ramifications of it. This raises interesting questions for knowledge representation and reasoning. Here we consider ramification analysis in which we wish to determine both the likely outcomes from events occuring and the less likely, but very significant outcomes, from events occuring. To formalize ramification analysis, we introduce the notion of causal maps for modelling "causal relationships" between events. In particular, we consider existential event classes, for example presidential-election, with instances being true, false, or unknown, and directional events classes, for example inflation, with instances being increasing, decreasing or unchanging. Using causal maps, we can propagate new information to determine possible ramifications. These ramifications are also described in terms of events. Whilst causal maps offer a lucid view on ramifications, we also want to support automated reasoning, to address problems of incompleteness, and to represent further conditions on ramifications. To do this, we translate causal maps into default logic, and use the proof theory and automated reasoning technology of default logic. In this paper, we provide a syntax and semantics for causal mapping, and a translation into default logic, and discuss an integration of the approach with langauge engineering.

Reference-contexts: Default logic is one of the best known and most widely studied formalisations of default reasoning <ref> [Bes89, Bre91, GHR94, Ant97] </ref>. Furthermore, it offers a very expressive and lucid language. In default logic, knowledge is represented as a default theory, which consists of a set of first-order formulae and a set of default rules for representing default information.

Reference-contexts: An informal modelling technique, that is related to causal maps, is cognitive maps. In a cognitive map, a directed labelled graph is used to capture the structure of a decision-maker's stated beliefs about a particular problem <ref> [Axe76] </ref>. Some cognitive maps can be used for a form of ramification analysis. Uncertainty and causality are handled in a range of other approaches. In Bayesian networks (for a review see [Jen96]), a directed acyclic graph is used to represent causal relations between random variables.

Reference-contexts: As an example of an information extraction system, we consider LOLITA (Large-scale Object-based Linguistic Interactor Translator and Analyser), a system based on a general purpose natural language processing system, that has been applied in the financial domain <ref> [CCM96, CCM95] </ref>. In this system, a short summary is derived from each financial news article according to specific criteria. This approach uses templates that incorporate a predefined number and type of slots and each slot can be filled with information extracted from the news article.

Reference-contexts: Of particular relevance here is the area of language engineering called information extraction. This area is concerned with transforming natural language text into a reduced and refined form, highlighting pertinent points, and removing superfluous information <ref> [CL96] </ref>. In this section, we consider integrating ramification analysis with information extraction, by feeding extracted information directly into a ramification analysis knowledgebase.

Reference-contexts: + + 0 0 0 0 + Table 3: An inconsistent resolution table: There are two rows where A has truth value + and B has truth value , and C has different truth-values in them. since (P; N; A; T ) is a set of definite clauses and, by <ref> [DG84] </ref>, there is a linear-time algorithm for theorem proving with definite clauses. Therefore the time taken in (1) plus (2) is polynomial, and it is an upper limit on the time taken on the decision of whether (P; N; A; T ) j= OE holds.

Reference-contexts: In particular, they provide a means for looking at the ramification of the change in possibilistic variables as dictated by the possibility distribution and the axioms of possibility theory. Finally, causal mapping is complementary to a variety of approaches to argumentation (for examples of formalisms for argumentation see <ref> [Pra93, EGH95, Pra97, VLG98] </ref>). Indeed, causal mapping may be viewed as a form of argumentation.

Default logic is one of the best known and most widely studied formalisations of default reasoning [Bes89, Bre91, GHR94, Ant97]. Furthermore, it offers a very expressive and lucid language.

Reference-contexts: We have chosen default logic as the formalism for ramification analysis because it is one of the most well-explored formalisms for default knowledge. There is a range of useful variants, and inferencing technology is being developed (for a review see <ref> [Sch98] </ref>). Last, but not least, default logic offers a natural and straightforward route for developing ramification analysis knowledgebases. 3.2 Translating causal maps into default logic In section 2.3, we identified a number of requirements for using causal maps with resolution tables.
