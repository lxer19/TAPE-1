Abstract: As computational power and storage capacity increase, processing and analyzing large volumes of multi-dimensional datasets play an increasingly important part in many domains of scientific research. Our study of a large set of scientific applications over the past three years indicates that the processing for such datasets is often highly stylized and shares several important characteristics. Usually, both the input dataset as well as the result being computed have underlying multi-dimensional grids. The basic processing step usually consists of transforming individual input items, mapping the transformed items to the output grid and computing output items by aggregating, in some way, all the transformed input items mapped to the corresponding grid point. In this paper, we present the design of T2, a customizable parallel database that integrates storage, retrieval and processing of multi-dimensional datasets. T2 provides support for common operations including index generation, data retrieval, memory management, scheduling of processing across a parallel machine and user interaction. It achieves its primary advantage from the ability to seamlessly integrate data retrieval and processing for a wide variety of applications and from the ability to maintain and jointly process multiple datasets with different underlying grids. We also present some preliminary performance results comparing the implementation of a remote-sensing image database using the T2 services with a custom-built integrated implementation.

Reference-contexts: These datasets are usually multi-dimensional. The data dimensions can be spatial coordinates, time, or varying experimental conditions such as temperature, velocity or magnetic field. The increasing importance of such datasets has been recognized by several database research groups and several systems have been developed for managing and/or visualizing them <ref> [2, 8, 17, 22, 32, 38] </ref>. In addition, commercial object-relational database systems provide some support for managing multidimensional datasets (e.g., the SpatialWare DataBlade Module [36] for the Informix Universal Server and the Oracle 8 Spatial data cartridge [31]).

Reference-contexts: T2 uses multi-dimensional indices (e.g., R fl -trees <ref> [3, 16] </ref>, quad-trees [13]) to manage these datasets. For a given dataset, a separate index is created for every attribute space of interest.

Reference-contexts: This attribute space must be registered with T2 as a base attribute space. Data blocks are the basic unit for data storage and retrieval in T2. Thus, the data generated by the hydrodynamics module must be partitioned into blocks using an unstructured grid partitioning algorithm (e.g., recursive coordinate bisection <ref> [4] </ref>). To allow data blocks to be accessed by their 14 spatio-temporal attributes, an index (e.g., an R-tree) is created, with a bounding box for each data block used as the access key.

Reference-contexts: Typical examples of very large scientific datasets include long running simulations of time-dependent phenomena that periodically generate snapshots of their state (e.g. hydrodynamics and chemical transport simulation for estimating pollution impact on water bodies <ref> [5, 7, 23] </ref>, magnetohydrodynamics simulation fl This research was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant #ASC 9318183, ARPA under Grant #DABT 63-94-C-0049 (Caltech Subcontract #9503), and the Office of Naval Research under Grant #N6600197C8534. <p> Such tools include a hydrodynamics simulator, such as ADCIRC or UTBEST [7, 23], which simulates the flow of water in the domain of interest, and a chemical transport simulator, such as CE-QUAL-ICM <ref> [5] </ref>, which simulates the reactions between chemicals in the bay and transport of these chemicals. For each simulated time step, each simulator generates a grid of data points to represent the current status of the simulated region.

In prior work <ref> [6] </ref> we have shown that Titan delivers good performance for both small and large queries. A set of sample queries were used to evaluate the performance of the T2 implementation against that of Titan.

Reference-contexts: As for mapping functions, T2 currently supports static linking; we plan to provide dynamic linking in the near future. By default, T2 uses the minimax algorithm [26, 27] for declustering and the Short Spanning Path (SSP) algorithm <ref> [11] </ref> for clustering. In addition, T2 allows the data layout to be separately computed and provided in a file. This would be useful if the algorithms used to compute the placements were embedded in some other application that could not be structured to fit T2's interface requirements.

Reference-contexts: However, input data chunks that intersect with multiple accumulator chunks must be retrieved multiple times. These memory management strategies are similar to the strip-mining and/or blocking operations performed for optimizing cache usage for matrix operations <ref> [9, 19, 28] </ref>. 10 4.7 The query execution service The query execution service manages all the resources in the system using the schedule created by the planning service.

These datasets are usually multi-dimensional. The data dimensions can be spatial coordinates, time, or varying experimental conditions such as temperature, velocity or magnetic field.

Reference-contexts: In addition, commercial object-relational database systems provide some support for managing multidimensional datasets (e.g., the SpatialWare DataBlade Module [36] for the Informix Universal Server and the Oracle 8 Spatial data cartridge <ref> [31] </ref>). These systems, however, focus on lineage management, retrieval and visualization of multidimensional datasets. They provide little or no support for analyzing or processing these datasets the assumption is that this is too application-specific to warrant common support.

Reference-contexts: These datasets are usually multi-dimensional. The data dimensions can be spatial coordinates, time, or varying experimental conditions such as temperature, velocity or magnetic field.

These datasets are usually multi-dimensional. <p> Furthermore, every application developer has to implement complex support for managing and scheduling the processing. Over the past three years, we have been working with several scientific research groups to understand the processing requirements for such applications <ref> [1, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 26, 27, 33] </ref>. Our study of a large set of applications indicates that the processing for such datasets is often highly stylized and shares several important characteristics. Usually, both the input dataset as well as the result being computed have underlying multi-dimensional grids.

Reference-contexts: As in T2, Titan is able to support both input partitioning and output partitioning strategies. Since interprocessor communication does not overlap well with the computation on the Maryland SP- 2 <ref> [34] </ref>, and the AVHRR data chunks are not uniformly distributed across the entire spatial extent of the database, we have chosen to show results for the input partitioning strategy, which performs better than the output partitioning strategy due to both lower communication overhead and better load balance.

Reference-contexts: For portability, the T2 query execution service uses the POSIX lio listio interface for its non-blocking I/O operations, and MPI <ref> [35] </ref> as its underlying interprocessor communication layer. To show the effectiveness of T2, we have used the various T2 services to implement a remote- sensing image database that emulates the functionality of Titan [6] on the Maryland SP-2.

Reference-contexts: During processing, this attribute space is mapped to another attribute space, which is a grid in the Interrupted Goodes Homolosine map projection <ref> [37] </ref>. T2 allows users to index this dataset either on the underlying latitude-longitude-time attribute space or on the attribute space jointly defined by the Goodes map projection and time. Second, T2 leverages commonality in processing requirements to seamlessly integrate data retrieval and processing for a wide variety of applications.
