Note: CS294-1 On-line Computation Network Algorithms  Lecture  In this guest lecture John Kleinberg talks about Adverserial Queuing Theory. The talk is based on the papers [BKRSW95] and [AAFKLL96]. 11.1 Introduction  11.1.3 Queuing Theory  11-1  
Abstract: We first go over some introductory material on queuing theory. Circuit-switched and packet-switched are the two basic routing technology for networks. In this lecture, we concentrate on the "dynamics of traffic" of the former. The model generally used consists of an injection process, which inject packets into a link one at a time, and a link-traversed process, which let packet crosses the link one at a time. Contention can result if there are more than one packet waiting to traverse a link; this can be resolved by using a contention resolution protocol. Examples of such include First-In-First-Out (FIFO), Farthest-To-Go (FTG), Nearest-To-Go (NTG), and mechanisms that based on timestamps like Longest-In-System (LIS) and Shortest-In-System (SIS). The research of packet routing is applicable in the areas of parallel architectures and communication networks. There are research on static routing, and dynamic routing in which you want to allow the algorithm to run continuously and study its long term behavior. There are many well solved problems in queuing theory but they all make assumptions about the network configurations. For example, when service rate or arrival rate is exponentially distributed, we can infer several things like which is the best contention resolution protocol to use in this situation. However, our goal here is to find out what can be proved with as few of assumptions as possible.
