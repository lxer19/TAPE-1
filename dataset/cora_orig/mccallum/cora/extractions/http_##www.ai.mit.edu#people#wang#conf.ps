Reference-contexts: The goal of our research is to develop better methods for conformational search of macro-cyclic molecules, which are ring-like molecules with 10 or more bonds in the ring. There are a number of important classes of macrocyclic molecules, for example, the macrolides are important antibiotics <ref> [1, 2] </ref> and macrocyclic musks are of importance in perfumery. Furthermore, problems such as conformational search of protein loops during homology modeling [3] can be cast as conformational search of macrocycles.

Cyclic molecules are challenging targets for conformational search because their low-energy conformations are more constrained than those of acylic molecules.

Reference-contexts: For acylic molecules, it is generally easy to construct, without recourse to energy minimization or extensive search, candidate conformations that do not have excessive energies; this is the basis of many 3 conformational search strategies <ref> [4] </ref>. The same cannot be said for cyclic molecules because of the need to satisfy the ring closure constraint. <p> The resulting conformations are then energy minimized. A review and comparison of the performance of these methods in the context of searching for the low-energy conformers of cycloheptadecane, the 17-carbon unbranched cycloalkane, is found in <ref> [4] </ref>. A number of other approaches to conformational search have been explored in the literature. Genetic algorithm has been applied to conformational search by Judson et al [14, 15]. They found that it is better than another algorithm on an acyclic molecule. <p> Section 5 compares their performance to our new approach. The main problem with existing approaches to conformational search is their inefficiency. For example, with cycloheptadecane all methods required more than 30 CPU days on a MicroVAX II to find most low-energy conformations <ref> [4] </ref>. Most of the CPU cycles are spent on minimizing the energy of the candidate conformations. For example, starting from a random conformation, each minimization takes about a minute on a SPARCstation 2 under BatchMin V3.5 [20]. <p> Table 1 compares the performance of the complementarity algorithm to Goto and Osawa's corner-flapping 17 algorithm [5]. Our algorithm has a higher ratio of low-energy conformations to the total number of conformations found. The second cycloalkane used as a benchmark is cycloheptadecane, the 17-carbon cy-cloalkane. Saunders et al. <ref> [4] </ref> applied seven methods to search for its conformations. They found that several of the methods have roughly similar performance. We applied the complementarity algorithm to this molecule using BatchMin V3.5 and the MM2 force field. These are the exact program and energy function used in Saunders et al.'s paper. <p> The hash function computes the location of an element from its key. The Member operation finds all elements in the table with a certain key. All operations on the hash table can be performed in a constant amount of time [27]. 10. <ref> [4] </ref> describes the CPU time for finding the 203rd, 232nd, and 249th useful conformation. We deduced the approximate number of minimizations from their data. 24
Reference: [5] <author> H. Goto and E. </author> <title> Osawa, </title> <journal> Journal of American Chemical Society, </journal> <volume> 111, </volume> <month> 8950 </month> <year> (1989). </year>
Reference-contexts: In addition to these general conformational search methods, several ring-specific algorithms have been developed. These methods typically consist of operators for modifying 6 existing ring conformations, followed by minimization of the resulting structures. They use operations like corner flapping <ref> [5] </ref>, edge flipping [6], and torsion flexing [7]. Guarnieri and Wilson [19] have applied simulated annealing with an exact ring closure algorithm to the same problem. The complementarity method described in this paper belongs to this class of algorithms. Section 5 compares their performance to our new approach. <p> To preserve the chirality of new conformations, the reflected substructure cannot have any chiral center. The mirror operator is a specialized form of the combine operator. It is equivalent to applying combine to a conformation and its mirror image. Goto's operators are special cases of this operator. Corner flapping <ref> [5] </ref> reflects two bonds while edge flipping [6] reflects three bonds. By looking at all pairs of bonds and computing their planarity, we explore more conformational space more efficiently. There is also a greater chance of lowering total energy because more bonds are changed. <p> The complementarity method is 3.48 times faster. More importantly, the result suggests that the algorithm completely explores the low-energy conformational space. Table 1 compares the performance of the complementarity algorithm to Goto and Osawa's corner-flapping 17 algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. Our algorithm has a higher ratio of low-energy conformations to the total number of conformations found. The second cycloalkane used as a benchmark is cycloheptadecane, the 17-carbon cy-cloalkane. Saunders et al. [4] applied seven methods to search for its conformations.

Section 5 compares their performance to our new approach. <p> For chain or tree-like molecules, one can 8 simply change the torsional angle of some rotatable bonds because these molecules do not have the closure constraint. Finding such operators for macrocyclic molecules is much harder. Other researchers have used operators like corner flapping or edge flipping <ref> [6] </ref>, but the candidates they generate have much higher energy than the global minimum. This is because some local geometries (bond angles) are deformed. Before presenting the operators we use, we present two hypotheses about low-energy conformations that motivate the operators. 1. Low-energy conformations have low-energy substructures. 2. <p> The mirror operator is a specialized form of the combine operator. It is equivalent to applying combine to a conformation and its mirror image. Goto's operators are special cases of this operator. Corner flapping [5] reflects two bonds while edge flipping <ref> [6] </ref> reflects three bonds.

It is a well known representative of the ansamycin family [24] (Figure 10). Kolossvary and Guida <ref> [7] </ref> have also worked on the conformations of this molecule. They suggest that it is an extremely difficult conformational search problem for current technology. The molecule is completely asymmetric. There are strong electrostatic interactions and several intramolecular hydrogen bonds.

Reference-contexts: New ring-specific algorithms ([5, 6, 7]) can perform much better than these general algorithms but are still very time consuming. 2 Previous Work Conformational search methods have been studied for many years. Dale <ref> [8] </ref> has performed early pioneering work on large rings. Currently, most methods do not distinguish between cyclic and acyclic molecules. Many of these methods consist of some technique for generating candidate conformations which are then subjected to energy minimization.

Reference-contexts: Stochastic techniques have the advantage of being able to generate a random sample of low-energy conformations for molecules that are too flexible to explore systematically. For example, the stochastic version of internal coordinate tree search is internal coordinate Monte Carlo search <ref> [10] </ref>. In each step of the algorithm, several torsion angles are randomly varied. The resulting conformation becomes the new starting point of minimization. When applied to macrocyclic molecules, the random variation of torsional angles often produces conformations that violate the ring-closure constraint. Those structures cannot be used for minimization.

Reference-contexts: Those structures cannot be used for minimization. The Monte Carlo step has to be repeated until a suitable structure is found. One of the simplest stochastic techniques is Cartesian stochastic search <ref> [11] </ref>. It represents a conformation by the Cartesian coordinates of each atom. The method operates by taking a known conformation and applying limited, random translations ("kicks") to every atom in the molecule. The resulting conformation becomes the new starting geometry for energy minimization. <p> We use BatchMin V3.5 [20] and its MM2 force field for minimization. E is set to 6 kcal/mol. The global minimum is found to be 20.415 kcal/mol. Figure 7 shows the results of the new algorithm and Cartesian stochastic search <ref> [11] </ref> running on the molecule. After 2000 Monte Carlo steps, 15 conformers are found to be within 3 kcal/mol of the global minimum. We believe that these are all the conformers because every minimum has been found several times.

Reference-contexts: The molecule changes its conformation due to thermal motion. The 5 higher the simulated energy, the broader the conformational sampling. At certain time inter-vals, the algorithm collects the conformations of the molecule being simulated and minimizes them. The distance geometry <ref> [12, 13] </ref> method represents molecules primarily 2 as a set of lower and upper bounds on the distances between every pair of atoms. These distance bounds embody bonded constraints, such as bond lengths and angles, as well as non-bonded constraints, such as van der Waals radii.

Reference-contexts: Most of the CPU cycles are spent on minimizing the energy of the candidate conformations. For example, starting from a random conformation, each minimization takes about a minute on a SPARCstation 2 under BatchMin V3.5 <ref> [20] </ref>. Cartesian stochastic search, internal coordinate tree search and Monte Carlo search, and distance geometry all require about 10,000 minimizations each for this 51-atom molecule. Therefore, these algorithms would take about 7 days on a SPARCstation 2. <p> For the following results on cycloalkane, only 30 minima are found using the randomized method in Step 1 of the top level procedure. Our program is first run on cyclotridecane, the 13-carbon cycloalkane, to validate its completeness. We use BatchMin V3.5 <ref> [20] </ref> and its MM2 force field for minimization. E is set to 6 kcal/mol. The global minimum is found to be 20.415 kcal/mol. Figure 7 shows the results of the new algorithm and Cartesian stochastic search [11] running on the molecule.

Reference-contexts: We assume that all bond lengths and bond angles are fixed, but the dihedral angles are free to change. Go and Scheraga <ref> [21] </ref> have shown that two fixed end bonds would generate six nonlinear equations on the dihedral angles. Therefore at least six dihedral angles are needed to satisfy the equations. To apply the operators, the smallest substructure would have six bonds (Figure 4).

Reference-contexts: To form a new starting conformation, a rigid transformation (Step 4)is needed to transform the end bonds and other atoms of the complementary substructure. This is achieved by the algorithm in <ref> [22] </ref>. A 4fi4 transformation matrix can be computed to best match (in the least squared distance sense) the coordinates of the atoms on the end bonds of C and the complementary substructure.

Reference-contexts: This check is necessary because many similar starting conformations are found by the algorithm. 5. If the new minimum has not been found before, Generate starting conformations is called with it as the argument. 6. Go to 3. This algorithm has been implemented in Common Lisp <ref> [23] </ref>. The MM2 force field is used for minimization and energy evaluation. The next section will evaluate the performance of the algorithm. 5 Performance Evaluation We compared the new algorithm with several existing methods, using the the number of energy minimizations and the number of "useful" conformational minima found.

Reference-contexts: An alternative to complete search of conformation space is described in <ref> [26] </ref>, where the search focuses on finding a set of maximally different conformations that "cover" the low-energy conformation space. 2. Distance geometry information (e.g. a matrix listing the distances between all atom pairs) is unable to distinguish between a structure and its mirror image.
