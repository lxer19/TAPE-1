Abstract: Integrating a production rules facility into a database system provides a uniform mechanism for a number of advanced database features including integrity constraint enforcement, derived data maintenance, triggers, alerters, protection, version control, and others. In addition, a database system with rule processing capabilities provides a useful platform for large and efficient knowledge-base and expert systems. Database systems with production rules are referred to as active database systems, and the field of active database systems has indeed been active. This chapter summarizes current work in active database systems; topics covered include active database rule models and languages, rule execution semantics, and implementation issues.

Reference-contexts: In general, given the power of the other rule languages discussed in this survey, it is an undecidable problem to determine in advance whether rules are guaranteed to terminate, although conservative algorithms have been proposed that warn the rule programmer when looping is possible <ref> [Aiken et al. 1992] </ref>. A run-time solution to detecting and preventing infinite loops is to provide a rule triggering limit. In this case, the number of rules executed during rule processing is monitored; if the limit is reached, rule processing is terminated.

Reference-contexts: This has the benefit that the rules can be shared by many application programs, and the database system can optimize their implementation. The production rule paradigm originated in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with expert systems rule languages such as OPS5 <ref> [Brownston et al. 1985] </ref>. Typically, in AI systems, a production rule is of the form: condition ! action An inference engine cycles through all the rules in the system, matching the condition parts of the rules with data in working memory.

Reference-contexts: In addition, active database systems must provide mech 17 anisms for event detection and rule triggering, for condition testing, for rule action execution, and for user development of rule applications. 4.1 Characteristics of Representative Systems The Ariel active database system is built using the Exodus database toolkit <ref> [Carey et al. 1991] </ref>. The focus of Ariel's implementation is on efficient condition testing, which is achieved by incorporating a highly tuned discrimination network that extends the Rete and TREAT networks used by AI rule languages [Wang and Hanson 1992].

Reference-contexts: While some work has been done in this area, continued improvements are needed. Distribution and Parallelism: So far, active databases have been considered primarily in centralized database environments. An initial consideration of the problem of rule processing in distributed and parallel environments appears in <ref> [Ceri and Widom 1992] </ref>, but this is only a theoretical study relating to a particular rule language. Many issues arise when considering a distributed or parallel active database system, including the distribution and fragmentation of rules and algorithms that guarantee equivalence with centralized rule processing.

The attachment feature is used to monitor data modifications that are of interest to rules. These modifications are stored in a main-memory data structure called a transition log.

Reference-contexts: Rather than selecting one triggered rule to execute using some form of conflict resolution, HiPAC executes all triggered rules concurrently. If, during rule execution, additional rules are triggered, they also are executed concurrently. To do this, HiPAC uses an extension of the nested transaction model of execution <ref> [Moss 1985] </ref>, which lends itself well to this rule processing semantics and to the realization of coupling modes. The basic rule processing algorithm in HiPAC is described as follows: 1.

In this chapter, we will illustrate the features of active database systems using Ariel [Hanson 1992], HiPAC [Chakravarthy et al. 1989, Dayal et al. 1988, McCarthy and Dayal 1989], POSTGRES <ref> [Stonebraker et al. 1990, Stonebraker and Kemnitz 1991] </ref>, and Starburst [Widom et al. 1991, Widom and Finkelstein 1990] as representative of the field.

Unfortunately, the semantics can differ between the two approaches, as explained in <ref> [Stonebraker and Kemnitz 1991] </ref>. 18 The Starburst database system has as one of its primary goals extensibility [Haas et al. 1990], and the rule system implementation relies on Starburst's extensibility features. The attachment feature is used to monitor data modifications that are of interest to rules.

Reference-contexts: The focus of Ariel's implementation is on efficient condition testing, which is achieved by incorporating a highly tuned discrimination network that extends the Rete and TREAT networks used by AI rule languages <ref> [Wang and Hanson 1992] </ref>. When data modification commands are executed in Ariel, the modified tuples are packaged as tokens and passed to the discrimination network, where rule conditions are tested.
