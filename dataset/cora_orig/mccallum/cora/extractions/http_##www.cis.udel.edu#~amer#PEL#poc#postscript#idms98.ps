Abstract: We apply the concept of network-consciousness to image compression, an approach that does not simply optimize compression, but which optimizes overall performance when compressed images are transmitted over a lossy packet-switched network such as the Internet. Using an Application Level Framing philosophy, an image is compressed into path MTU-size Application Data Units (ADUs) at the application layer. Each ADU carries its semantics, that is, it contains enough information to be processed independently of all other ADUs. Therefore each ADU can be delivered to the receiving application out-of-order, thereby enabling faster progressive display of images. We explain why this approach is useful in general and specifically for wireless/heterogeneous environments.

Reference-contexts: In phase two, we modified two popular image compression techniques, namely GIF89a 3 and SPIHT [14] (wavelet zerotree encoding), to make them network-conscious. Because of lack of space, we will summarize only the network-conscious GIF algorithm. Interested readers may refer to the references <ref> [1, 11, 12] </ref> for more information on NETCICATS and algorithms. 4.1 Network-Conscious GIF We modified the GIF89a standard to make it network-conscious. <p> Because of lack of space, we will summarize only the network-conscious GIF algorithm. Interested readers may refer to the references [1, 11, 12] for more information on NETCICATS and algorithms. 4.1 Network-Conscious GIF We modified the GIF89a standard to make it network-conscious. The result, called GIFNCa <ref> [1] </ref>, removes the ordered delivery requirement (and for some applications the reliability requirement) of GIF89a by framing image data at the compression phase (i.e., application level). The tradeoff between GIFNCa and GIF89a is one of compression vs. progressive display performance. GIF89a's advantage is its expected better compression. <p> Due to space limitations, we provide only a portion of the results in this paper. Interested readers may refer to <ref> [1] </ref> for more information and results. The average percentages of image data being displayed at various points in time for 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% IP packet loss rates are graphed in Figure 4. At 0% loss rate, GIF89a performs better due to its higher compression ratio.

Reference-contexts: Wireless networks have at least two inherent differences from wired networks that require special attention. The first difference is that wireless networks suffer from high bit error rates and hand-off problems resulting in more TPDU losses than a wired network <ref> [2] </ref>. This implies that more out-of-sequence arrivals at the transport receiver can be expected. If an application cannot decompress these out-of-sequence data, they have to be buffered delaying the processing and painting of these data on the screen. Network-conscious image compression solves this problem by eliminating the in-sequence processing requirement.

Reference-contexts: We apply the concept of network-consciousness [6] to image compression, an approach that takes network Quality of Service (QoS) into consideration when designing image compression.

Reference-contexts: There are two basic requirements for the ideal case to work: (1) An alternative transport protocol must be available to provide an unordered, no-loss service. TRUMP [9] and POCv2 <ref> [4, 5] </ref> are two such transport protocols under development. (2) The receiving application must be able to decompress and display TPDUs independent of each other. That is, the image compression algorithm should allow out-of-order processing of incoming image data. Definition 1.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, compression algorithms should not focus solely on achieving minimum image size; algorithms should be optimized to give the best performance when images are transmitted over such networks.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore the nature of the delivery is bursty and results in higher jitter. This burstiness may result in bottlenecks at the receiving application <ref> [7] </ref>. In a heterogeneous network that consists of variable speed wired and wireless links, we hypothesize that network-conscious compressed images will perform well because they adapt to different network conditions. <p> One research team argues that "network-consciousness" should be adopted as a design principle for many future applications [8]. Another advantage of using network-conscious image compression is that transmission control can be tailored to the characteristics of each ADU <ref> [7] </ref>. Not all parts of image data are uniform and require the same QoS. If the image compression algorithm provides layering of information, different layers of image data require different reliabilities and priorities.

Reference-contexts: Adaptability guarantees that applications will use all available resources and make efficient usage of these resources. This is especially important for multicast communication where each participant has different requirements.

Reference-contexts: Network-conscious image compression solves this problem by eliminating the in-sequence processing requirement. The second inherent difference is that wireless devices are constrained in both their computing and communication power due to limited power supply <ref> [10] </ref>. Therefore, the transport protocols used on these devices should be less complex to allow efficient battery usage. With network-conscious image compression, a more efficient and simple transport protocol that needs not preserve order can be used.

Reference-contexts: Depending on the Internet's loss and delay characteristics, the cost of using more service than is needed can be significant <ref> [13] </ref>. Consider the following TCP-based scenario: a client Web browser retrieves a progressive image from a remote HTTP server over the Internet. After connection establishment, the client sends a request message and the server starts submitting chunks of image data to the transport sender. <p> With network-conscious image compression, a more efficient and simple transport protocol that needs not preserve order can be used. The expected buffer requirements at the transport receiver for an unordered protocol are always less than the buffer requirements for ordered protocols assuming a lossy network <ref> [13] </ref>. Ordered transport protocols require more computation to reorder ADUs before delivering them to the application thereby delaying the delivery of ADUs and resulting in a longer occupancy of the transport receiver's buffers. Furthermore the nature of the delivery is bursty and results in higher jitter.
