Abstract: The analytic center of a polytope P + = fx 0 : Ax = b; e T x = 1g is characterized by a saddle point condition j=1 x j = 1g. This paper presents properties of the marginal function f (y) = maxfg(x; y) : x 2 S ++ g and explores the possibilities of a Lagrangian relaxation method for approximating the analytic center.

Reference-contexts: This direction is closely related to the one used in the primal-dual infeasible-interior-point algorithms of [4] and <ref> [1] </ref>. The problem of minimizing the logarithmic barrier function c T x n X log x j (x 2 P ++ ) over P ++ is directly related with interior-point methods for linear programs. Here c 2 R n is a constant vector and &gt; 0 is a parameter.

Reference-contexts: For every k 2 let k = k1 if f (x k ) &gt; f (x k1 ) ff k kd k k 2 ; k1 otherwise; Rule 1 is Armijo's rule (see Luenberger <ref> [3] </ref>). Rule 2 is simpler since it requires only one evaluation of f per iteration. In both cases, f k g is bounded. By Theorem 2.3, there exists a compact D R m such that y k 2 D for all k.

Reference-contexts: The set fx () : &gt; fl g is called the central trajectory or the path of centers. Thus, tracing the central trajectory numerically, we obtain an approximate minimal solution of the linear program.

For a polytope P defined by a T j x fi j (j = 1; 2; . . . ; m); fl Research supported in part by ONR under contract N00014-91-C-0026. This research was done when M. Kojima and S. <p> Renegar [5] proposed a polynomial-time algorithm for linear programming based on successive approximations of the analytic center x () for an appropriate sequence f k &gt; fl g converging to fl . Many other algorithms have since then been developed along similar lines (see, e.g., the survey article <ref> [7] </ref> and its references). In each iteration of Newton's method one needs to solve a linear system of equations induced by a local linearization of the problem, which generally requires O (n 3 ) arithmetic operations, where n denotes the dimension of the linear system.
