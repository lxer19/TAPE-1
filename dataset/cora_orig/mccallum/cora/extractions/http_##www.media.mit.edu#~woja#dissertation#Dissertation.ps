However, no work has yet been published that deliberately undertakes the design of a smart network cache by considering all three technologies simultaneously. <p> Conversely, data-centered techniques allocate transmission channels to a piece of the object in a predefined manner and rely on the receivers to determine which channel they should listen to in order to receive the data required. Examples of user-centered batching algorithms can be found in <ref> [6, 21, 22, 71] </ref> while data-centered ones can be found in [34, 72]. Recently, several data-centered methods have emerged that achieve close to on-demand control of a movies playback by partitioning the movie into several parts that are then cached in the receiver before viewing. <p> Building upon the earlier work of Viswanathan and Imielinski on Pyramid Broadcasting (PB) [72], and Aggarwal, Wolf, and Yus refinement, Permutation-based Pyramid Broadcasting (PPB) <ref> [6] </ref>, Skyscraper Broadcasting uses the following design principles: Divide the available bandwidth, Mbit/sec, equally amongst the movie titles and further divide the Mbit/sec of bandwidth allocated to each title into partitions of Mbit/sec.

Reference-contexts: Rather than build and deploy full scale applications, two example applications were developed and deployed in the controlled environment of the MIT Media Lab ATM <ref> [7, 99] </ref> Local Area Network. The aim was not to test scalabil-itysince this had been achieved through simulationbut to validate, test, and verify the HPRTP protocol, and the feasibility of supporting local HPRTP caches on commonly available computing hardware.

Reference-contexts: As such, the preemptive repair strategy used by the SHARQFEC mechanism within HPRTP makes it a prime candidate for mass media delivery via satellite. Cable television (CATV) is another network type poised to exploit multicast in a few-to-many fashion <ref> [8, 36, 60, 62, 75] </ref>. Cable access providers not only have access to extremely high bandwidth paths that feed into peoples homes, but also the means to manage them with greater control than possible with satellite links.

Reference-contexts: Another problem that arises from using IP addresses occurs as a result of the impending shift from the current version of IP (IPv4) [67, 76, 103]which uses 32 bit addressesto the next generation of IP (IPnG or IPv6) <ref> [9, 93, 95] </ref>which uses 128 bit addresses. IPv4s 32 bits represent a total of 4.3x10 9 sources, moving to IPv6s 128 bits addresses that represent a total of 3.4x10 38 sources is an over-kill that increases bandwidth requirements. <p> This fact presents opportunities for reducing group maintenance overhead. Instead of constructing a multicast tree for each group, a single source-based tree could be constructed with the tree required for smaller scopes using subsets from the original. If IPv6 <ref> [9, 93, 95] </ref> were used, traffic filtering at scope boundaries could be done using the scope field within the IPv6 multicast address. The separate LDSC and repair channels created at different scopes could then be differentiated and pruned using the ow-label field.

Reference-contexts: Introduction The computer has forever changed the way in which we create, manipulate, and store information. All manner of mediafrom text and pictures to audio and videois now operated on in digital form, and the old analog forms that use atoms instead of bits <ref> [10] </ref> are finding less and less use. However, this digital revolution is only half complete. While the tools exist for the creation, manipulation, storage, and display of digital media, an efficient means for distributing it in the ways traditionally used by analog media does not.

Reference-contexts: Hints enable the caches to make smart decisions about how to minimize network usage, and therefore are a key mechanism for increasing scalability. 44 45 Chapter 4 Reliable Multicast Data Delivery When multicast service was first introduced to the internet in the form of the MBone <ref> [12] </ref>, reliable delivery was not guaranteed. Since then, adding reliability to IP Multicast has been a much sought-after goal. This task is far from trivial. Initial efforts to map TCPs positive acknowledgment (ACK) model into a multicast framework worked only for sessions containing small numbers of participants.

Reference-contexts: Several measures were taken to counter ACK ooding. Some reduced the frequency of ACKs by acknowledging multiple packets at once. Others introduced control structures such as token rings <ref> [14, 74] </ref>. Receivers in the token ring were required to take turns in supplying repairs and to halt transmission of new data until all previously transmitted data had been received. <p> Many schemes, with varying degrees of success, have been developed to limit traffic implosion. Popular models for traffic reduction involve the use of structures based on token rings <ref> [14, 74] </ref>, clouds [27], and trees [31, 32, 33, 50, 59, 78]. Token-ring protocols suffer from serious scaling limitations. Cloud-based approaches increase scalability in a general manner, while tree-based approaches increase it still furtherbut usually require some manner of manual configuration.

Reference-contexts: Long haul links and wide-distribution services will be provided by satellite links that feed strategically placed caches. These caches will then provide content locally over wireline systems that may include cable television and Digital Subscriber Line (x-DSL) <ref> [16] </ref> links. Real-time delivery of two-way content, such as conferencing, multi-user game events, and shared workspaces will likely use pure wireline systems to avoid the propagation delay inherent in the use of satellite links. The HPRTP protocol is ideally poised to exploit such hybrid systems when they become available. 132 133

The Destination Set Group (DSG) mechanism proposed by Cheung et al. <ref> [17] </ref> allows the receivers to organize themselves into groups that experience similar amounts of loss and throughput and to instruct the sender to simulcast data at a rate that ensures a similar level of performance within each group.

Reference-contexts: Since smart network caches are expected to cache the contents of packets, packet identification also affects the operation of the local RAM and disk caches. Clark and Tennenhouses ALF principle <ref> [19] </ref> addresses this problem. The ALF principle dictates that the task of packet identification should be left to the application, since it knows how best to segment its data for transmission and how to recover from errors when they occur. <p> Typically group management mechanisms are not explicit in Receiver-Driven protocols and receivers are free to join and leave sessions as they please. This idea is known as Lightweight Sessions (LWS) [43] and further implies the existence of Application-Level Framing (ALF) <ref> [19] </ref>. LWS states that transport protocols should be extensible entities that implement a minimum level of functionality while providing the means for extensions as needed by various applications.

Reference-contexts: In order to provide the illusion of on-demand access, each receiver must be equipped with a sizeable cache. Previous caching work has concentrated on the creation of caches for entire small web objectseither as proxies <ref> [23, 83] </ref> or as part of the routers [18]or the use of intermediate caches between the sender and the receiver [26, 66]. <p> Thus, one must group multiple objects for delivery over the same channel. This idea has been explored by Clark and Ammar for the case where Web objects are transmitted over separate groups whose address is generated by hashing the text of the Web objects URL <ref> [23] </ref>. HPRTPs exible naming scheme and scoping mechanisms point toward a different architecture in which traffic is segregated upon the basis of its source, content type, and location of receivers. 131 8.4 Deployment Multicast is still a edgling technology thatdespite being over ten years oldhas many unresolved issues.

Reference-contexts: Should a movies initial partition not be present in the disk cache, the viewer could wait for the first partition to load. Given current rates of decline in disk drive prices [45] and increases in capacity <ref> [24, 45] </ref>, it is not too outrageous to envision a super set-top box with a 10 Gbyte storage capacity. If 1.5 Gbytes of this drive were reserved for the higher order segments, that leaves 8.5 Gbytes for the storage of the movies first few segments.

Reference-contexts: This breaks the often referenced but seldom used concept of protocol layering espoused within the OSI layered protocol stack [65, 69]. Localized Recoveryas put forward by Floyd et al. <ref> [27] </ref> states that when a session member requests data, the closest possible receiver capable of doing so should be the one to supply it. <p> While this approach works well for unicast applications, it does not scale well for multicast applications, since repairs must originate from the original source. Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) <ref> [27] </ref> and the Real Time Transport Protocol (RTP) [105, 106], solve this problem by tagging each packet with a unique number that identifies the datas original source instead of the host sending the packet. <p> The next tool developed to stem the ow of back traffic was that of suppression. Suppression is based upon the idea that receivers should not transmit a NACK for a particular packet if a NACK for that packet is received from another receiver. Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) <ref> [27] </ref> is based upon this idea andlike token-ring protocols pushes considerable functionality from the sender into the receivers. Since the release of SRM a number of protocols have been released that further attempt to stem traffic through localization techniques based on trees [31, 32, 33, 50, 59, 78]. <p> This new mechanism merges the existing methods of Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) and Forward Error Correction (FEC) with additional new localization techniques based on Administrative Scoping. Readers familiar with the concepts of ARQ as implemented within SRM <ref> [27] </ref> and FEC [29, 56, 57, 63, 64] may proceed directly to 4.2, on page 57. 4.1 Background Given that IP multicast delivery is by definition unreliable, one must consider the inclusion of mechanisms that allow receivers to recover from lost packets in any transport protocol that uses it. <p> Many schemes, with varying degrees of success, have been developed to limit traffic implosion. Popular models for traffic reduction involve the use of structures based on token rings [14, 74], clouds <ref> [27] </ref>, and trees [31, 32, 33, 50, 59, 78]. Token-ring protocols suffer from serious scaling limitations. Cloud-based approaches increase scalability in a general manner, while tree-based approaches increase it still furtherbut usually require some manner of manual configuration. Many tree-based approaches incorporate suppression mechanisms borrowed from cloud-based approaches. <p> For that reason, it is worth examining the operation of the cloud-based Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM)protocol in detail. The analysis of SRM that follows is largely derived from that presented by Floyd et al. in their seminal paper describing SRMs operation <ref> [27] </ref>. This analysis does, however, present new interpretations as to why SRM works better in some topologies than others. SRMs operation is completely decentralized; there is no distinction between a sender and receivers during packet-loss recovery. <p> As reported in <ref> [27] </ref> the study of these two topologies is useful since they are the building blocks from which more general tree structures are derived. <p> This corresponds to the situation where R n s NACK timer expires before the reception of NACKs sent by other receivers. Thus, when is set in this manner for a star with receivers , duplicate NACKs will result <ref> [27] </ref>. Now suppose the value of is increased so that the inequality is true. In this case, suppression may occur. <p> The likelihood of suppression increases with . In <ref> [27] </ref>where it is further assumed that the delay contributed by each link is onethe number of NACKs resulting from a loss is shown to be approximately . Furthermore, [27] shows the average delay until the first timer expires is for the case where the star consists of external nodes (receivers plus the sender) for both results. Deterministic suppression is not possible for the star topology. <p> These values can be adjusted during data transfer according to the number of duplicate NACKs or repairs received. The basic algorithm for the dynamic adjustment of the timers is essentially the same for both the NACKs and repairs, and is given in <ref> [27] </ref>. t d s m, + t d S m, A 2 m, d S m, + + n t d S m, d S m, d S n, 2d S C, +( )+ + t d S n, A 2 n, d S n, + + 2d C m, A

Reference-contexts: Clients would introduce a small delay to allow for propagation skew for traffic from different receivers. This delay would enable them to sort events received out of order. An example of a serverless multicast game currently played over the Internet that uses these ideas is INRIAs MiMaze game <ref> [28] </ref>. As it is unlikely that the entire ADUI space described by an n-dimensional ADUI will be entirely populated, the meta description should also include mechanisms for describing which ADUIs are valid.

Readers familiar with the concepts of ARQ as implemented within SRM [27] and FEC <ref> [29, 56, 57, 63, 64] </ref> may proceed directly to 4.2, on page 57. 4.1 Background Given that IP multicast delivery is by definition unreliable, one must consider the inclusion of mechanisms that allow receivers to recover from lost packets in any transport protocol that uses it. <p> Finally, the fact that directed multicast requires modifications to the routers themselves raises questions about its ability to find widespread deployment. 4.1.2 Forward Error Correction (FEC) FEC methods <ref> [29, 56, 57, 63, 64] </ref> take a different approach for effecting repairs. <p> 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 y' x G y G' x Encode Transmit Decode Reorganize G k k' G' G y' 1 G p G' n k 57 4.2 Scoped Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest with Forward Error Correction (SHARQFEC) Recent work in <ref> [29, 57] </ref> has attempted to limit the number redundant packets processed during the transmission process by combining FEC with ARQ. The merger of these two techniques yields better performance than either method on its own. <p> The various hybrid ARQ/FEC protocols were simulated by turning off various features within SHARQFEC. The six protocols simulated are described in table 4-2. It should be noted that the SHARQFEC (ns,ni,so) protocol is nearly identical to ECSRM <ref> [29] </ref> except that ECSRM uses fixed timer windows for its suppression timers, while SHARQFEC (ns,ni,so)s timer windows are based on the RTTs measured between receivers. Simulations were performed on the same topology used for simulating the viability of session maintenance strategy.

Reference-contexts: As the degree of branching in the routing tree between the sender and the receivers increases, so does the likelihood that at least one receiver will experience the loss of any given packet sent by the sender. Several studies <ref> [30, 77] </ref> have proven this hypothesis, and some salient observations made by Mark Handley in his Ph.D. dissertation [30] are reproduced with permission in Figures 4-1 and 4-2. 47 48 during a half hour period on Tuesday 29th May, 1996 and two separate half hour periods for NASA Shuttle Mission STS-79 <p> Several studies [30, 77] have proven this hypothesis, and some salient observations made by Mark Handley in his Ph.D. dissertation <ref> [30] </ref> are reproduced with permission in Figures 4-1 and 4-2. 47 48 during a half hour period on Tuesday 29th May, 1996 and two separate half hour periods for NASA Shuttle Mission STS-79 on Tuesday 17th September, 1996. <p> In real world situations, where there are many more receivers connected by trees containing considerably more links, this figure has been shown to be close to 100% <ref> [30] </ref>. This simple analysis exposes the global nature of simple non-scoped ARQ techniques. Either the source must transmit each packet multiple times, or, if local recovery is being used, every session member must take part in the repair of every packet transmitted. <p> Currently, multicast addresses are allocated in an ad hoc manner using the announce and listen method provided by Mark Handleys Session Directory program, sdr <ref> [30] </ref>. Each sdr instance listens to announcements from other instances of itself, recording the address claimed within each announcement. When a new session is required, sdr generates an address or addresses at random from the valid address range of the desired scope. <p> These two mechanisms should be distinct <ref> [30] </ref>. HPRTPs extensive use of multiple administratively scoped multicast addresses for achieving scalable reliability and traffic localization further exacerbates the problem. 127 These shortcomings are well known and are being addressed within a new Working Group on Multicast Address Allocation (malloc) within the IETF.

This mechanism has two advantages over other hierarchical mechanisms, such as the installation of dedicated receivers <ref> [33, 59] </ref> or modifying the routers to support selective multicast [58]. First, the system must be robust without being inefficient. A reliance upon specially configured receivers creates the potential for catastrophic failure.

Cable television (CATV) is another network type poised to exploit multicast in a few-to-many fashion <ref> [8, 36, 60, 62, 75] </ref>. Cable access providers not only have access to extremely high bandwidth paths that feed into peoples homes, but also the means to manage them with greater control than possible with satellite links.

Reference-contexts: Congestion control mechanisms for point-to-point traffic are relatively easy to design and implement; for example, the receiver can instruct the sender to slow down or lower its bit rate <ref> [42, 102] </ref>. However, designing congestion control mechanisms for point-to-multipoint traffic is considerably more difficult. Instead of a single receiver, there are now multiple receivers, with the link capacities connecting them to the sender possibly varying by orders of magnitude.

Reference-contexts: Typically group management mechanisms are not explicit in Receiver-Driven protocols and receivers are free to join and leave sessions as they please. This idea is known as Lightweight Sessions (LWS) <ref> [43] </ref> and further implies the existence of Application-Level Framing (ALF) [19]. LWS states that transport protocols should be extensible entities that implement a minimum level of functionality while providing the means for extensions as needed by various applications. <p> Merging the findings from these efforts leads to the following set of base requirements for a LWS/ALF skeleton protocol that may be augmented by application designers to yield superior performance: 1 1. Most of these requirements were presented by Van Jacobson at ACM SIGCOMM94 <ref> [43] </ref> 46 Wherever possible, use multicast over unicast delivery. Use NACK-based reliability strategies over ACK-based ones to minimize response implosions. Inject randomness to lessen correlated traffic. Use data sources in lieu of packet sources for source identification.

Reference-contexts: Hierarchical Partitioning builds upon the foundation provided by layered video coding and generalizes the concept of layering by resolution and time introduced by RLM <ref> [53, 54] </ref>and LVRM [49]. Object data is split into a number of multiple parts according to application metrics. Examples of metrics for streaming media are data type, encoding method, spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and playback offset. <p> Similarly, a receiver may find that it is a laggard compared to its peers and decide to subscribe to a lower bandwidth group. The Receiver-Driven Layered Multicast (RLM) mechanism developed by McCanne <ref> [54] </ref>, sees the sender employ a layered transmission scheme with multiple streams. RLM operates in an open loop manner and relies on receivers to police their own use of network resources. Receivers actively measure and record the losses associated with each layer within a presentation.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that both the authentication and encryption mechanisms alluded to here and in RFCs 1825, 1826, and 1827 assume the confidential delivery of keys to the receivers. This is a nontrivial task that it is still subject of on going research <ref> [88, 55] </ref>. 5.7 HPRTP encapsulation of other Multicast Protocols At the time of this writing, reliable multicast protocols are still the subject of intense research and as yet there is no one clear standard for reliable multicast transport.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps the most aggressive attempt to limit the scope of NACKs and the subsequent repairs is that of directed multicast (also known as subcasting) put forward by Papadopoulos et al. in <ref> [58] </ref>. Directed multicasting is based upon the concept of pivot points that give routers the ability to selectively multicast packets to some parts of the distribution tree and not others. <p> This task can be achieved through the use of a hierarchy of nested administratively scoped regions. This mechanism has two advantages over other hierarchical mechanisms, such as the installation of dedicated receivers [33, 59] or modifying the routers to support selective multicast <ref> [58] </ref>. First, the system must be robust without being inefficient. A reliance upon specially configured receivers creates the potential for catastrophic failure. <p> Levines Tracer protocol [47, 48] which makes clever use of routing labels and the mtrace facility for determining the multicast path between two hosts and Ciscos Pretty Good Multicast (PGM) proposal [118] which creates loss trees for repair packets to follow point toward mechanisms that are capable of implementing subcasting <ref> [58] </ref>. Questions still remain about their ability to scale, since their use creates state directly proportional to the number of packets lost.

Many tree-based approaches incorporate suppression mechanisms borrowed from cloud-based approaches. <p> Both LBRM and RMTP rely on all members within the statically configured tree to operate correctly. This restriction is relaxed by Yatkavar, Griffoen, and Sudans Tree-based Multicast Protocol (TMTP) <ref> [78] </ref>. TMTP also arranges receivers in a hierarchy; however, it constructs the hierarchy dynamically. The resulting tree is built via a series of expanding ring searches in which a selected receivercalled a Domain Manager (DM)in each region attempts to discover a parent DM higher up the tree.

Reference-contexts: Instead of being used to separate traffic on the basis of time, partitions could be used to limit traffic on the basis of space. Consider, for example, a simulation game, such as Netrek <ref> [80] </ref>, in which players roam around a virtual space pursuing each other or some goal. Traditionally, games like Netrek have been implemented using the hub-and-spoke model in which clients send events to a central server that performs synchronization before relaying them back to the clients peers.

Therefore, this dissertation concentrates on the aspects associated with scalable reliable delivery. <p> Several Internet Drafts describing various schemes for scope discovery [111] and multicast address allocation <ref> [109, 110, 112, 113, 115, 116] </ref> are currently proposed. The schemes described in these drafts typically attempt to leverage or provide similar functionality to the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (dhcp) [96] and make temporary claims on small blocks of addresses.
