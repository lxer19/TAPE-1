Title: Exact Required Time Analysis via False Path Detection

Abstract: This paper addresses how to compute required times at intermediate nodes in a combinational network given required times at primary outputs. The simplest approach is to compute them based on topological delay analysis without any consideration of false paths. In this paper, however, we take into account false paths between the intermediate nodes and the primary outputs explicitly to characterize the timing constraints at the nodes more accurately. We show that this approach leads to a technique for computing a more refined and relaxed timing constraint than that obtained by topological analysis. We generalize the notion of required times from a single constant to a relation where a signal is required at different times depending on the values of the other signals.

Recently, Watanabe and Brayton [11] resolved the case where the subcircuit is a sequential circuit by showing that the complete functional flexibility of the subcircuit is expressible by a single non-deterministic FSM, called the E-machine.

Reference-contexts: Due to space limitation we will not discuss a technique to propagate arrival times forward, which can be found in [5]. Experimental results are given in Section 5.

The extended bounded delay-0 model [8], XBD0 model, is the delay model most commonly used in false path analysis. It is the underlying model for the floating mode analysis <ref> [3] </ref> and viability analysis [7]. Under the XBD0 model, each gate in a network has a maximum positive delay and a minimum delay which is zero. Sensitization analysis is done under the assumption that each gate can take any delay between its maximum value and zero.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 discusses a novel technique to propagate required times backwards by taking into account false path effects.

The full treatment of the problem including arrival time computation can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. 4 Computing Required Time under the Existence of False Paths In this section we consider the following simpler problem: Given a Boolean network, maximum delay of each gate, and required times at its primary outputs, compute required times at its primary inputs.

Reference-contexts: One possible approximation is to group them into clusters of neighboring required times conservatively. Controlling the number of clusters gives a trade-off between accuracy and CPU time for a more realistic delay model. We have recently shown <ref> [6] </ref> how this analysis leads to an abstract delay model for black boxes. The delay model can be accurate taking into account false paths, without giving the internal details of the box.

The efficiency of the algorithms is dependent on how much reconvergence a given circuit has. In the exact algorithm, we introduce one Boolean variable for each pair of a primary input and a potential required time.

A similar approach is in fact taken in timing optimization techniques <ref> [9] </ref> published in the literature, but their delay computation is based on topological longest paths thereby failing to capture some of existing timing flexibility.
