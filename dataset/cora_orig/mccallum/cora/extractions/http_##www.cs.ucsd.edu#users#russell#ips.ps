Title: Size-Depth Trade-offs for Threshold Circuits Extended size-depth trade-off for threshold circuits is obtained: any threshold
Keyword: c variables  
Note: The following  unfixed, where c 1 c 2 &gt; 0 and 3 are constants independent of n,k, and d. and AFOSR grants 89-0512 and 90-0008.  
Abstract: Abstract edges, where constants c &gt; 0 and 3 are constants independent of n and d. Previously known constructions show that up to the choice of c and this bound is best possible. In particular, the lower bound implies an affirmative answer to the conjecture of Paturi and Saks that a bounded depth threshold circuit that computes parity requires a super-linear number of edges. This is the first super-linear lower bound for an explicit function that holds for any fixed depth, and the first that applies to threshold circuits with unrestricted weights. The trade-off is obtained as a consequence of a general restriction theorem for threshold circuits with a small number of edges: For any threshold circuit with n inputs, depth d and at most kn edges, there exists a partial assignment to the inputs that fixes the output of the circuit to a constant, while leaving bn=(c 1 k) c 2 d A trade-off between the number of gates and depth is also proved: any threshold circuit of depth d that computes the parity of n variables has at least (n=2) 1=2(d1) gates. This trade-off, which is essentially the best possible, was proved previously (with a better constant) for the case of threshold circuits with polynomially bounded weights in [23]; the result in the present paper holds for unrestricted weights. fl Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, Ca 92093 y Dept. of Mathematics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 and Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, UCSD, La Jolla, Ca. 92093.

Reference-contexts: best known lower bound on the size of boolean circuits over the standard basis f AND, OR, NOT g for any problem in NP is a 4n 4 bound on the parity function [20]; over the basis of all 2 input functions, the best known lower bound is 3n 3 <ref> [4] </ref>. Since proving bounds for general circuits seems very difficult, it is interesting to look at restricted families of circuits, for example, small depth circuits over various bases.
