Abstract: This note reports on a mechanical proof that a tree insertion algorithm, similar to one shown to work correctly on ordered trees by Boyer and Moore, works correctly on search trees. A tree search algorithm and a In [1], Boyer and Moore defined the abstract data type "ordered tree", gave a tree insertion algorithm defined as a recursive function in the Boyer-Moore logic, and proved mechanically that this insertion function works correctly. Their definitions and theorems can be found in Appendix A. Recursively define a (binary) tree (of numbers) as either (i) the empty tree or (ii) an ordered triple containing a nonnegative integer, called the root of the tree, and two trees, called the left and right subtrees of the tree. fl On leave from the Department of Computer Science, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071.
