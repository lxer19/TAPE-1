Abstract: The NPARC Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes code was used in a systematic redesign of the NASA P2 hypersonic inlet. The first phase of the work involved computational experiments to determine appropriate grid densities, etc. for using NPARC to achieve grid-converged simulations of the P2 inlet which adequately matched published experimental data. The second phase of the work involved formulating the redesign of the P2 inlet as a numerical optimization problem which was attacked using state-of-the-art numerical optimization software. The resulting P2 inlet design is significantly superior to the original design. In particular, the static pressure distortion at the throat was reduced by more than a factor of five. 31st Joint Propulsion Conference, San Diego, CA, July 1995 AIAA-95-2760
