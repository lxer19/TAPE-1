Abstract: We present a numerical-analytical method to evaluate integrated services networks with adaptive routing, scheduling and admission controls. We apply our method to connection-oriented networks supporting different types of real-time connections. The network dynamics is described by difference equations which can be solved for both transient and steady-state performances. Results indicate that our method is computationally much cheaper than discrete-event simulation, and yields accurate performance measures. We compare the performance of different routing schemes on the NSFNET backbone topology with a weighted fair-queueing link scheduling discipline and admission control based on bandwidth reservation. We show that the routing scheme that routes connections on paths which are both under-utilized and short (in number of hops) gives higher network throughput.

Reference-contexts: Routing can be static or dynamic. For dynamic routing, we assume routing information is updated by periodic broadcasts by nodes of the status of their outgoing links during the last period. This periodic collection of status information is often used in routing algorithms proposed for integrated services networks (e.g., <ref> [1, 4, 11] </ref>).

Another design issue is related to how L p is defined. <p> We use here the ones that were considered in previous works (e.g., <ref> [4, 1, 6] </ref>) when selecting routes for connections. 5 The source would take into account the requirements of the new connection in addition to the current load on the path (assuming it is accurate) to test the feasibility of the path.

Reference-contexts: To avoid this, we can restrict the set of possible routes, for example, to the shortest (in number of hops) and close to shortest paths. 1 This is 1 Experiences with circuit-switched networks show that this restriction results in simple and efficient routing schemes <ref> [3, 38] </ref>. 4 acceptable because using a longer path for a connection ties up resources at more intermediate nodes, thereby decreasing network throughput. Furthermore, it also ties up more resources at each intermediate node because satisfying the end-to-end QoS requirement would require more stringent local QoS requirements.

Reference-contexts: Routing can be static or dynamic. For dynamic routing, we assume routing information is updated by periodic broadcasts by nodes of the status of their outgoing links during the last period. This periodic collection of status information is often used in routing algorithms proposed for integrated services networks (e.g., <ref> [1, 4, 11] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Thus this model can be applied to achieve more comprehensive evaluation of existing strategies and to propose more effective network control schemes. Among the main performance measures of interest are the instantaneous end-to-end connection blocking probabilities. To calculate them, we use the link decomposition technique <ref> [33, 19] </ref> to approximate the multi-link network as a collection of single-link networks. For each link, we approximate the relationship between the instantaneous local (or link-level) connection blocking probabilities and the instantaneous average numbers of established connections by the relationship at steady-state. <p> The first assumption is often made and is reasonable in practice <ref> [20, 19, 44] </ref>.

In this paper, we present results for a network with NSFNET backbone topology, weighted fair-queueing link scheduling <ref> [43] </ref>, admission control based on "effective bandwidth" [22], and three connection routing schemes.

Otherwise, the traffic pattern has to be characterized at each link as in <ref> [43, 12] </ref>. Given the above assumptions, it is straightforward to obtain the parameters of a class at a link. Consider, for example, the parameters of class c2 at link h0, 5i or link h5, 4i. <p> Note that each link will typically have a different set of schedulable states because links have different capacities, are used by different sets of classes, etc. Section 4 illustrates the computation of F j for a weighted fair-queueing scheduling <ref> [43] </ref>. The steady-state transition rates between the states of F j are functions of the c 0 and c 0 . We obtain S j c by solving this Markov chain. <p> In the following, we illustrate the computation of F j for a "per-connection" link scheduling algorithm of the weighted round-robin type. An example of this type of scheduling algorithms is weighted fair-queueing <ref> [43] </ref>. Here, each class-c connection is allocated (and guaranteed) a certain amount of bandwidth on link j 2 R c that is enough to satisfy its local QoS requirement. This required bandwidth depends of course on the local QoS and the packet generation characteristics of the connection.
