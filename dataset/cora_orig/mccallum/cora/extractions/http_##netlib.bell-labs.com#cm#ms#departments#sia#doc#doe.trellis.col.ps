Title: Trellis Display: Modeling Data from Designed Experiments

Abstract: Displaying data by conditioning has surfaced independently in a number of places and for many different types of data. One surfacing is the interaction plots used in the analysis of experimental data. Trellis display, an amalgam of ideas for displaying multivariable data, allows conditioning to be carried out in a very general way. Trellis was developed initially in the context of large data sets, but recent experience has demonstrated that it is also useful for modeling data from designed experiments, even small experiments with a moderate number of factors and a limited number of runs. There appear to be two reasons for the success: (1) Trellis is an exceedingly powerful tool for revealing the structure of interactions, even high-order interactions; (2) experiments with limited runs often are accompanied by low noise, because otherwise little would be learned by any technique, so the conditioning of Trellis can yield information even when there are only a very small number of points on each panel. The analysis of variance, pervasively used in the analysis of experimental data, is a powerful tool for answering specific questions about models for data, but a poor tool for guiding the overall modeling process. The addition of Trellis display substantially increases the ability of the data analyst to carry out model identification and diagnostic checking, often resulting in more parsimonious and better fitting models.

Reference-contexts: For a continuous numeric variable the levels are intervals; one important method for defining levels for a continuous vari able is the equal-count algorithm <ref> (Cleveland, 1993) </ref>. The data analyst specifies an order for the conditioning variables and an order for the levels of each conditioning variable. In almost all applications, it makes sense to use the natural order of the levels of numeric and ordered categorical variables. <p> One such residual display is shown in Figure 12, a Trellis graph of the residuals against T given D, L, and S. residuals and fitted values on both scales <ref> (Cleveland, 1993) </ref>. <p> On the transformed scale, the residuals are slightly skewed to the left. Neither distribution deviates appreciably from normality. of the residuals and fitted values on the transformed scale <ref> (Cleveland, 1993) </ref>. The right panel is a quantile plot of the residuals and the left panel is a quantile plot of the fitted values minus their mean.

Reference-contexts: Studies in graphical perception have shown that such judgments are most accurate overall when the absolute values of the orientations of the segments are centered on 45 ffi <ref> (Cleveland, 1994) </ref>. This banking to 45 ffi has been used on all of the displays shown so far.

Reference-contexts: Despite the agreement of theory and the pilot results, more data were taken and the spline model was confirmed <ref> (LeGrange et al., 1997) </ref>. 7 Discussion Our investigations have led to several conclusions about building models for experimental data. Trellis display is often quite useful for modeling data from designed experiments, even small experiments with a moderate number of factors and a limited number of runs.

Reference-contexts: The fl ij of the liberal-parameter model are quite general and describe interactions of very different types. One particular interaction that occurs commonly is fl ij = flff i fi j This is often referred to as "Tukey's one degree of freedom for non-additivity" <ref> (Tukey, 1949) </ref>. Mandel (1995) discusses the modeling of two-way data by this and similar models. If Tukey's model is appropriate for a set of two-way data, then it is desirable to use it in fitting the data in place of the liberal-parameter model.

Reference-contexts: For example, in Figure 3, a weighted mean of the absolute values of the orientations of the line segments is 45 ffi ; the weights are the lengths of the line segments. 4 Lead Concentration Data In the source publication for the lead concentration data <ref> (W. F. Hunt, 1985) </ref>, anova was used as a model building tool. The author states: "One potential problem is that the lead concentration data may be serially correlated and this could interfere with the assumption of independently identically distributed errors.
