Reference-contexts: To construct executable plans requires integrating the ideas of measurement from [11]. * We are investigating different representations for duration to reduce the ambiguity in plan-finding. An interesting possibility is to use partial quantiatitive information, as in Kuiper & Berleant's recent work <ref> [2] </ref>. * Incremental generation strategies require incremental qualitative simulation. Dennis DeCoste is designing an incremental version of QPE which could be harnessed for this purpose. 7 Acknowledgements This research was supported by the Office of Naval Research, Contract No. N00014-85-K-0225, and an NSF Presidential Young Investigator award.

Reference-contexts: We suspect that for some engineering applications, the cost of explicit generation of AE 's may be offset by the increased confidence in the quality of the answer, particularly as we discover how to build multi-grain domain models <ref> [5] </ref>. However, even if AE 's turn out to be infeasible to explicitly compute for all but the simplest systems, we expect the AE representation will be a useful theoretical foundation for developing incremental planning techniques.

Reference-contexts: A necessary prerequisite for this extension is that the qualitative physics be sensitive to changes in background assumptions. Qualitative Process theory <ref> [6] </ref> provides two forms of explicit representation of, and hence dependence on, background assumptions. First, QP descriptions specify the kinds of individuals they apply to. <p> The faucet is an infinite supply of water, and the stove is an infinite supply of heat, exactly when their respective knobs are ON (viz. Figure 1). Our goal is to have boiling water in the pot. The process vocabulary includes heat flow, liquid flow, and boiling <ref> [6] </ref>, and the actions are those shown in Figure 2. Here are the highlights of the AE created for this scenario. There are 244 situations, with 1054 transitions between them (78 due to dynamics, the rest due to actions). <p> This AE does indeed contain many correct plans for boiling water (see figure 4), and careful examination has revealed no unexpected oddities. Currently we are developing a series of test cases to ensure our closeness requirement is sufficient. If it is not, then we suspect that p-components <ref> [6] </ref> will be required to narrow the subset of the situation in which violations of continuity are allowed. 6 Discussion This paper proposes a method for integrating qualitative physics with models of action.

Reference-contexts: A particular measure of closeness for envisioning in QP theory is described in the next section. 3 An Algorithm for constructing AE s This algorithm for computing AE s is based on the representations used in the Qualitative Process Engine (QPE) <ref> [9] </ref>. Since QPE is based on an ATMS [4], and the formulation of AE s is based on describing different sets of assumptions, our algorithm will be particularly simple. <p> j 2 C 2 j6 9S k 2 C 2 s:t:j S k " S i j &gt; j S j " S i jg The first step provides our initial candidates by enforcing consistency, and the second uses the same continuity pruning used for limit analysis in QPE (see <ref> [9] </ref> for details). The final step provides a precise definition for the notion of closeness described before in this algorithm, it is literally the number of assumptions shared with the previous situation.

Reference-contexts: For example, the current representation of sensing steps assumes that the parameter involved in the transition can be directly sensed. To construct executable plans requires integrating the ideas of measurement from <ref> [11] </ref>. * We are investigating different representations for duration to reduce the ambiguity in plan-finding. An interesting possibility is to use partial quantiatitive information, as in Kuiper & Berleant's recent work [2]. * Incremental generation strategies require incremental qualitative simulation.

Reference-contexts: Yet little work to date has addressed the issue of integrating a qualitative physics with representations of actions. One way to integrate physics with action is to move the physics into the planner. Hogge <ref> [12] </ref> has developed an domain compiler that takes QP domain models and produces rules and operators suitable for a temporal planner.
