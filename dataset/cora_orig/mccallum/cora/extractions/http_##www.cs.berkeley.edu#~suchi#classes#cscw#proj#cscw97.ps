Abstract: Experience from recording and re-playing the 14 CSCW Using CSCW lectures this semester has shown the need for improved viewing tools. While the existing suite of MASH viewing tools are an excellent prototype, they demand large client resources (~ 1-2 GB of hard disk per lecture), or special access to the archive host containing recorded data. They provide little support for navigation and annotation of archived sessions. Our goals in designing improved playback tools are three-fold: remote invocation, navigation and annotation. In this paper, we describe the design, implementation, and preliminary evaluation of our system.
