Abstract: This paper examines a novel digital modulation/multiple access technique called Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA) where each data symbol is transmitted at multiple narrowband subcarriers. Each subcarrier is encoded with a phase offset of 0 or p based on a spreading code. Analytical results are presented on the performance of this modulation scheme in an indoor wireless multipath radio channel.

Reference-contexts: Introduction This paper examines the performance of a new spread spectrum transmission method called MC-CDMA in an indoor wireless environment. MC-CDMA may be a suitable modulation technique in the indoor environment where the dispersive character of indoor propagation <ref> [1] </ref> allows for the exploitation of this technique. With MC-CDMA, each data symbol is transmitted over N narrowband subcarriers where each subcar-rier is encoded with a 0 or p phase offset. <p> The transmitted signal corresponding to the kth data bit of the mth user (a m [k]) is (1) F t+( ) p T b i 0= = 2 where c m [0], c m <ref> [1] </ref>, ... , c m [N-1] represents the spreading code of the mth user and is defined to be an unit amplitude pulse that is non-zero in the interval of [0, T b ].

Reference-contexts: If the number of and spacing between subcarriers is appropriately chosen, it is unlikely that all of the subcarriers will be located in a deep fade and consequently frequency diversity is achieved. As an MC-CDMA signal is composed of N narrowband subcarrier signals <ref> [2] </ref> each with a symbol duration, T b , much larger than the delay spread, T d , an MC-CDMA signal will not experience significant intersymbol interference (ISI).

Reference-contexts: The transmitted signal consists of the sum of the outputs of these branches. For F = 1, this scheme is similar to performing Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) <ref> [3] </ref> on a Direct-Sequence spread-spectrum signal [4]. Recently, there has been a growing interest on idea of combining OFDM and DS-CDMA [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]. Modern DSP methods make the implementation of MC-CDMA feasible and attractive. With F = 1, the transmit bandwidth is minimized. <p> This method combines the advantages of bandspreading, code division and frequency diversity of Direct-Sequence CDMA with the advantages of Multi-Carrier Modulation. Depending of the choice of the F-parameter, the transmit spectrum can either be minimized with the strong attenuation of adjacent channel sidelobes which is typical in OFDM <ref> [3] </ref> or intentionally widened to achieve a larger frequency-diversity performance gain without excessively increasing the spreading factor. For wireless office communication systems operating in deregulated ISM bands, the latter is very desirable since these systems are often designed with minimum signal processing complexity in order to reduce terminal power consumption.

Moreover, simulations presented at PIMRC94 <ref> [6] </ref> suggest that multi-signal detection schemes can further enhance the performance of MC-CDMA. Conclusion In this paper, a new spread spectrum technique was introduced and its bit error rate for a Rayleigh fading dispersive channel was analyzed.

Moreover, Multi-Carrier Modulation (MCM) or Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), as applied in our concept, is known to be an efficient method for performing channel equalization. MC-CDMA modem design will be discussed in detail in a paper by Fettweis et al. <ref> [7] </ref>. A direct comparison between DS-CDMA and MC-CDMA requires careful choice of the channel model and its effects on the detection process. Presumably, the assumption of a highly selective channel with multiple resolvable paths will favor MC-CDMA. A fair comparison should further be made for receivers with comparable complexity.

Reference-contexts: This model implies that each modulated subcarrier with transmission bandwidth of 1/T b does not experience significant dispersion (T b &gt;> T d ). As Doppler shifts are very small and typically in the range of 0.3-6.1 Hz <ref> [10] </ref> in the indoor environment, it is also assumed that the amplitude and phase remain constant over the symbol duration, T b .
