Abstract: It is well known that the spatial frequency spectrum of membrane and thin plate splines exhibit self affine characteristics and hence behave as fractals. This behavior was exploited in generating the constrained fractal surfaces in the work of Szeliski and Terzopou-los, which were generated by using a Gibbs sampler algorithm. The algorithm involves locally perturbing a constrained spline surface with white noise until the spline surface reaches an equilibrium state. In this paper, we introduce a very fast generalized Gibbs sampler that combines two novel techniques namely, a preconditioning technique in a wavelet basis for constraining the splines and a perturbation scheme in which unlike the traditional Gibbs sampler, all sites (surface nodes) that do not share a common neighbor are updated simultaneously. In addition, we demonstrate the capability to generate arbitrary order fractal surfaces without resorting to blending techniques. Using this fast Gibbs sampler algorithm, we demonstrate the synthesis of realistic terrain models from sparse elevation data.

Reference-contexts: plate energies can be combined to obtain the control continuity spline whose energy is given by E s (u) = 1 R R 2 2 2 +[1 t (x; y)](u x + u y )g dxdy; (3) where (x; y) and t (x; y) are real-valued weighting functions defined on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. <p> Similarly, the discrete approximation of the biharmonic operator at node (i; j) is given by 1 h 2 (20u i;j u i+1;j1 + u i+1;j+1 ) + u i2;j + u i+2;j + u i;j2 + u i;j+2 ) (using a 13-point approximation) <ref> [1] </ref>. The discrete Laplacian and bihar-monic matrices of size N fi N are constructed using this discretiza-tion. The eigenvalues of these matrices can be computed in closed form using properties of matrix tensor products. The eigenvalues describe the spectral content of the matrices corresponding to these discretized operators (see [4]).

Reference-contexts: Szeliski and Terzopoulos [19] have proposed constrained fractals for constructing terrain models from sparse elevation data. The problem is formulated in a Bayesian framework wherein the prior model consists of a thin-plate-membrane spline energy converted into a probability distribution using the Boltzman law from statistical mechanics <ref> [6] </ref>. A random sample from this distribution exhibits fractal behavior and can be obtained using a Gibbs sampler. They demonstrated that the membrane and thin plate surfaces have a fractal order of fi = 2 and 4 respectively. <p> If the perturbation yields a system state with a lower energy E (u), it is accepted; else, it is accepted with a probability exp (E=T ), where E is the energy difference between the perturbed and unperturbed system. This algorithm was proved to converge in Geman and Geman <ref> [6] </ref>. In [19], it was shown that a random sample from the Gibbs distribution exhibits self affine characteristics and hence is a stochastic fractal. <p> This variant is faster than the traditional Gibbs sampler described in Geman and Geman <ref> [6] </ref> since it updates every site with a perturbation in the field at each iteration. However, the convergence of this algorithm to a random sample from the Gibbs distribution was not discussed. <p> We also used a variant of the traditional Gibbs sampler called the generalize Gibbs sampler whose convergence properties are known [3]. The generalized Gibbs sampler is faster than the traditional one in <ref> [6] </ref> since it allows for the updating of several separated sites simultaneously and independently. We described a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm that speeds up the stochastic relaxation algorithm considerably. Experiments depicting the performance of our algorithm in comparison to those reported in literature were performed.

Reference-contexts: The standard iterative schemes like Gauss Siedal, conjugate gradient etc. converge very slowly for our problem as the condition number of K is very high. One way to speed up the convergence of the iterative method is via preconditioning <ref> [7] </ref>. For a linear system Ku = b with a positive-definite matrix K, the first consideration for a matrix P to be a good preconditioner of the linear system is that the condition number of P 1 K be greatly reduced.

As long as the QMF filters are of finite length, the solution can be obtained in O (N ) operations, where N is the number of nodes after discretization.

Reference-contexts: A random sample from the corresponding Gibbsian distribution of this prior model will be a fractal surface of order fi. The corresponding fractal dimension D can be obtained using the relation D = E + 1 H, where E is the topological dimension and H, the Hurst factor <ref> [16] </ref>, is given by 2H = fi E. For fractal surfaces fi varies between 2 and 4 corresponding to fractal dimensions of 3 and 2 respectively. It may be noted that a similar idea was also used in Vemuri and Radisavljevic [23] to generate arbitrary order fractal surfaces.

Reference-contexts: In Fig. 3, constrained fractals of varying fractal dimension D are presented. These fractals are generated via modulation of the frequency characteristic of wavelet basis (described earlier) and not via blending the frequency characteristic of a plate and membrane spline as in <ref> [17] </ref>. Our method is not only simple and straightforward but also very much intuitive. It can be easily extended to generate fractals of any dimension, thereby giving tremendous flexibility to the user. Fig. 4 shows fractal surfaces synthesized from real terrain data on a 256 fi 256 grid.

Reference-contexts: Splines can be used to represent piecewise smooth objects and they allow for easy control of position, slope and curvature. Fractals allow for easy representation of high level of detail in a shape but do not provide enough control of shape. In <ref> [19] </ref>, these complementary techniques of representation were combined to produce constrained fractals. In this paper, we present a very fast algorithm for generating constrained fractals which are very useful for realistic representation of terrain maps and other objects with natural detail. <p> However, the fractal surfaces created by these methods have spatially nonstationary statistics, require equal grid spacing and need high computation time.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The variational spline fitting problem is reviewed in Section 2. Section 3 contains a brief description of the stochastic relaxation algorithm from <ref> [19] </ref> followed by a discussion of the generalized Gibbs sampler used in our conjugate gradient based stochastic relaxation algorithm. <p> We present a very fast solution to this problem, based on a novel preconditioning technique, in a later section. 3 PROBABILISTIC FORMULATION In this section, we will first briefly describe the Gibbs sampler presented in <ref> [19] </ref> and then present a new generalized Gibbs sampler technique that is used along with a preconditioned conjugate gradi ent technique to produce a stochastic relaxation algorithm for synthesizing constrained fractal surfaces. 3.1 Generalized Gibbs Sampler The variational spline fitting can be embedded into probabilistic framework by using the Boltzman/Gibbsian distribution <p> a new generalized Gibbs sampler technique that is used along with a preconditioned conjugate gradi ent technique to produce a stochastic relaxation algorithm for synthesizing constrained fractal surfaces. 3.1 Generalized Gibbs Sampler The variational spline fitting can be embedded into probabilistic framework by using the Boltzman/Gibbsian distribution of statistical mechanics <ref> [19] </ref>. <p> This algorithm was proved to converge in Geman and Geman [6]. In <ref> [19] </ref>, it was shown that a random sample from the Gibbs distribution exhibits self affine characteristics and hence is a stochastic fractal.

The solution to this minimization is obtained by solving a very large sparse linear system Ku = b as discussed earlier. We employ an iterative method to solve this large sparse linear system. <p> The solution to this auxiliary linear system is obtained by taking the wavelet transform, modulating the transformed vector using the diagonal matrix M, and taking the inverse wavelet transform. 4.2 Fractal Surfaces of Arbitrary Order In <ref> [19] </ref> it was shown that a random sample from a Gibbsian corresponding to a membrane or thin plate prior exhibited self affine characteristics and was a fractal process of fi = 2 or 4 respectively.
