Title: TURBO CODES FOR COHERENT FH-SS WITH PARTIAL BAND INTERFERENCE

Abstract: In this paper, turbo codes are investigated in a slow frequency-hopped spread spectrum (FH-SS) system with partial-band jamming. In addition, full-band thermal noise is present. This paper focuses on the implemen-tion of a modified turbo decoder for this model. We consider cases of known or unknown channel state and variable number of bits per hop. Our approach is to modify the calculation of branch transition probabilities inherent in the decoder. Analytical bounds are derived and simulation is performed for coherent demodulation. The results drawn from this code are compared with a convolutional code.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Turbo codes are an exciting new channel coding scheme that achieve almost reliable data communication at signal-to-noise ratios close to the Shannon limit. The results published in the inaugural paper by Berrou et al <ref> [2] </ref> were so good that they were met with much skepticism. Since then, however, these results have been reproduced and even improved. Consequently, much of the present research is applying turbo codes to different systems. <p> In Section 7, we conclude by discussing the potential of turbo codes in FH-SS systems. 2 System Model 2.1 Transmitter The turbo encoder is formed using two constituent codes. As in the original work by Berrou et al <ref> [2] </ref>, the constituent codes considered in this paper are recursive systematic convolutional codes. The turbo encoder is formed by concatenating the constituent codes in parallel and then separating the codes by an inter-leaver [5]. <p> The derivation of this algorithm will not be repeated, as it has been well documented in previous papers [1] <ref> [2] </ref>. Let S k be the state of the encoder at time k, and L k be the log likelihood ratio (LLR) of the a posteriori probabilities.

Reference-contexts: One solution is to calculate an average upper bound by computing an average weight function over all possible interleaving schemes <ref> [4] </ref>. We define an average weight function as k X i p (dji) (18) where p (dji) is the probability that an interleaving scheme maps an input weight of i to produce a code word of total weight d and i is the number of input frames with weight i. <p> Thus, P word n X k X i p (dji) P 2 (d) (19) n X k X i i p (dji) P 2 (d): (20) An algorithm for calculating p (dji) is given in <ref> [4] </ref>. Thus, in order to compute this bound, we need only calculate P 2 (d). Over a channel with both full-band thermal noise and partial-band jamming noise, we can calculate the pairwise error probability by conditioning on the number of jammed symbols. <p> The bounds are known to diverge for SNRs below 2 or 3 dB <ref> [4] </ref>, a range close to the area of interest. Thus for coherent reception, we cannot concretely determine the precision of the bounds. Note, however, that for the case with SI, the general shape of the bounds conform to what is expected.
