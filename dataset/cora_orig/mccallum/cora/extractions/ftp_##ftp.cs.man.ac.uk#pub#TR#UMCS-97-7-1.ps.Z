Reference-contexts: In a companion paper [7], we develop a rather general formal semantic theory for the meanings of temporal prepositions and temporal preposition phrases, and show how they temporally modify nouns and VPs by introducing a novel concept of Temporal Generalized Quantifiers (TGQs), a natural extension of the classical generalized quantifiers <ref> [1] </ref>. In doing so, we had to introduce some complicated operations in the -calculus, due to the restriction on the order of accessibility to variables imposed by fi-reductions as triggered by function application (this is explained below at the end of section 3.1).

Reference-contexts: A deductive approach towards the syntax-semantics interface has recently been developed within the LFG [6] framework, using the "resource conscious" linear logic (LL) [5]. The most elaborate treatment within this framework is presented in <ref> [4] </ref>, and we follow closely their approach (and notation). We should note that we are very weakly committed (if at all) to the "resource consciousness" of LL. Rather, we are more attracted by the general application of logic ("glue language" in the nomenclature of [4]) to deriving the meanings of sentences; <p> within this framework is presented in <ref> [4] </ref>, and we follow closely their approach (and notation). We should note that we are very weakly committed (if at all) to the "resource consciousness" of LL. Rather, we are more attracted by the general application of logic ("glue language" in the nomenclature of [4]) to deriving the meanings of sentences; the only use of the "resource consciousness" we make here is the ability to derive "temporary meanings", to be replaced by the "ultimate meaning" as the derivation proceeds. (This point will be come clearer in the course of the paper.) We deviate from [4] <p> <ref> [4] </ref>) to deriving the meanings of sentences; the only use of the "resource consciousness" we make here is the ability to derive "temporary meanings", to be replaced by the "ultimate meaning" as the derivation proceeds. (This point will be come clearer in the course of the paper.) We deviate from [4] in attributing meaning-assembly axioms (explained below) to minimal f-structures, and not to lexical elements (only). We first summarize the NL data we intend to cover. First, we show how to derive the meaning of temporal quantification within TPPs expressed as generalized temporal quantifiers. <p> We use here the fragment of LL used in <ref> [4] </ref>, in which `' denotes linear conjunction, and `ffi' linear implication. The deduction-rules of LL are used to derive composed meanings from their components. Usually, we will use the phrase "combining formulae" (of LL) to mean instantiating universal variables via a given substitution, and applying the "linear" modus-ponens rule. <p> Usually, we will use the phrase "combining formulae" (of LL) to mean instantiating universal variables via a given substitution, and applying the "linear" modus-ponens rule. All derivations are derivations from assumptions. We refer to such assumptions as meaning-assembly axioms. In <ref> [4] </ref>, the meaning-assembly axioms come in the form of LL formulae associated with the lexical entries of the words in the interpreted sentence. As mentioned above, we depart here from [4] in that we associate meaning-assembly axioms with minimal f-(sub)structures, and not with words. <p> All derivations are derivations from assumptions.

As mentioned above, we depart here from [4] in that we associate meaning-assembly axioms with minimal f-(sub)structures, and not with words. This provides the possibility, of which we make heavy use, to have meaning-assembly axioms contributed by (minimal) f-(sub)structures that are not -related 4 to any node in the c-structure. <p> This provides the possibility, of which we make heavy use, to have meaning-assembly axioms contributed by (minimal) f-(sub)structures that are not -related 4 to any node in the c-structure. This move does not affect anything done in <ref> [4] </ref>, but is essential in our context. It has also the methodical advantage that once an f-structure has been constructed, the c-structure and the source sentence can be "forgotten" as far as semantic interpretation is concerned. <p> All meaning-assembly axioms are instantiated for the f-structure at hand, and do not refer to LFG's meta-variables. Whenever an f-structure that induces a meaning-assembly axiom does correspond to a lexical entry, we shall continue to refer to that axiom as lexical, to align our presentation with <ref> [4] </ref>. An alternative possibility, which seems less attractive, would be to associate meaning-assembly axioms with empty categories (which in our case would need to violate the principle of lexical expression of [2]). The use of LL ensures that only derivations that use all assumptions are admissible. <p> The use of LL ensures that only derivations that use all assumptions are admissible. The reader is referred to <ref> [4] </ref> for a discussion of the significance and effect of linearity ("resource sensitivity") of the glue-language logic for this kind of syntax-semantics interface. 3 Non-temporally-modified sentences We start by showing how to derive the meanings of non-temporally-modified sentences (i.e., sentences with no TPPs), constructed out of transitive/intransitive verbs and their subcategorized <p> The derivation is similar to the corresponding derivation in <ref> [4] </ref>, but with the following two main differences: (i) the appropriate revisions of the meaning-assembly axioms related to nouns and verbs, due to their extra temporal arguments (the result of changing the type of prepositions to (i,t)), and (ii) the use of non-lexical meaning-assembly axioms. <p> For the f-structure f , we have the following meaning-assembly axioms. The first is given in (17). This axiom corresponds roughly to the lexical semantic contribution of kiss in <ref> [4] </ref>. The reader is referred to [4] for the rationale behind the original axiom, in which the verb has no temporal arguments.

Reference-contexts: References are too numerous to list here; see a [8] for a recent survey. Very little research has been devoted to temporal prepositions (TPs) and temporal prepositional phrases (TPPs). In a companion paper <ref> [7] </ref>, we develop a rather general formal semantic theory for the meanings of temporal prepositions and temporal preposition phrases, and show how they temporally modify nouns and VPs by introducing a novel concept of Temporal Generalized Quantifiers (TGQs), a natural extension of the classical generalized quantifiers [1]. <p> Here, on Saturday temporally modifies 2am to create a TPP that modifies the matrix VP. Certain structural ambiguities of TPP attachment arise, and are handled by the proposed semantics. A full discussion of the semantics can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. We do not present these derivations here, as they do not illustrate any further advantages of using the glue-language approach beyond the illustration by the derivations presented in this paper. <p> We do not elaborate on this issue here. 2 ample of a non-lexically-contributed axiom. A similar ambiguity occurs with sentences with a quantified subject, such as (13) Every student failed. A driving idea behind the semantics (as developed in <ref> [7] </ref>) is that a sentence like (10) can have three different functions in the context of temporal modification. 1. The sentence can have a "stand-alone" meaning, reporting the occurrence of the appropriate kissing event during an appropriate time-interval. 2. <p> The sentence can itself serve as a complement of a TPP which modifies some other sentence, as in (7). We refer to these meanings as the stand-alone meaning, pre-modified meaning and modifying meaning, respectively. The semantics in <ref> [7] </ref> provides for all these possibilities, which explains certain complications in the meanings assigned to temporal nouns and verbs, which are not apparent in the stand-alone reading of sentences. <p> We ignore this distinction here, and use kiss also as an IL relational constant, but in a different font. 3 We find the presentation by means of the extra type i much clearer and use it in the sequel. More detailed discussion appears in <ref> [7] </ref>. The additional type i interacts also with other types in accordance with our intended interpretation of temporal expressions. Thus, propositions are viewed as depending on temporal intervals, and are assigned the type (i,t), instead of their more usual type t. <p> A semantics for for TPP temporal modification of sentences headed by stative verbs can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. 6 (22) 8H8S8I i ( (f oe TOI) ; i I i i (f oe ; i I 0 i )) ffi H ; t a (J i [J i I i ^ kiss (mary; john)(J i )]; S) ). <p> Thus, the final stand-alone meaning of (15) can be paraphrased as follows. Given an evaluation time I, there exists an occurrence time J , which is a subinterval of I, over which Mary kissed John. In the setup of <ref> [7] </ref>, LL formulae like (22) represent TGQs, expressions of the form P (i;t) I i [OE (P; I)]. <p> No ordering is imposed on access to verb-arguments or indexical arguments. This should be contrasted with a direct IL representation of the meaning of kiss as a -expression. Some particular order has to be imposed on the arguments. One candidate for this meaning (and the one used in <ref> [7] </ref>) is yJxI [kiss (x; y)(J )^I J ]: This imposes an order of functional application, which occasionally has to be overruled. In [7], special operations were introduced to the -calculus to overcome this difficulty. <p> Some particular order has to be imposed on the arguments.
