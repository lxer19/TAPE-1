Abstract: This paper presents a solution to the problem of connectivity of portables to an ATM wired network in the local area environment. A compatible ATM approach is used to provide support for multi-media traffic. Spatial re-use of a single frequency with a large number of small cells is used to increase the aggregate throughput. An experimental system based on low-cost fixed ATM switches and software controlled base stations has been developed.

Reference-contexts: Base-stations are simple cell-relays which translate the header formats from the Radio ATM network to the wired ATM network. Reducing the size of the pico-cells has major advantages in mitigating some of the major problems associated with in-building wireless LANS <ref> [ARR87] </ref>. The main difficulties encountered are the delay spread due multi-path effects and the lack of a line-of-sight path resulting in high attenuation.

Reference-contexts: In this scheme there is no explicit colouring of pico-cells and an access mechanism is used which is resilient to co-cell interference. In a traditional mobile network, such as the cellular telephone networks, transmission-cells are coloured using frequency division multiplexing or code division multiplexing to prevent interference between cells <ref> [Ber87] </ref>. Within a building it is notoriously difficult to predict the propagation characteristics of micro-waves and this colouring of cells is a difficult problem [FFG + 93].

Reference-contexts: The physical topology of the network, the actual bit-error rates at the receiver and the observed received signal strength are used to make the hand-over decision. This is more robust than relying on signal strength only as in [VH93] and <ref> [Ber93] </ref>. The control messages from the MR for hand-over between base stations Bi and Bj using signalling over pre-established circuits are shown in figure 2 . The sequence of messages is: 1. Switch Virtual Paths at Mobile Switching Point. 2.

Reference-contexts: A number of techniques are known for stabilising slotted ALOHA, (pseudo-Bayesian, FCFS) <ref> [BG87] </ref>, but in general these rely on determining the outcome of each transmission attempt. All terminals communicating via a base-station can monitor acknowledgements with a high degree of success, but it is not necessarily possible to detect collisions or idle slots.

Reference-contexts: Of more interest is short range, high aggregate bandwidth and compatibility with the wired network. 1.1 ATM ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) has been advocated as an important technology for the wide area interconnection of heterogeneous networks <ref> [bis90] </ref>. There is currently interest in using ATM in the local area to provide improved performance for applications end-to-end.

Reference-contexts: The main difficulties encountered are the delay spread due multi-path effects and the lack of a line-of-sight path resulting in high attenuation. The RMS delay spread [SV87] is a good measure of the multi-path dispersion and <ref> [BMZ93] </ref> shows that there is some correspondence between the receive and transmit antenna separation (pico-cell size here) and the RMS delay spread. There have been a large number of large-scale attenuation models proposed for in-building radio propagation [Has93] and attenuation in most of these cases is considerably greater than line-of-sight.

Reference-contexts: However, each station is only aware that it is failing to succeed so it is possible for successful sources to be unaware that they are swamping other transmissions. This means that if a number of sources are saturated there is no guarantee of evenness of access to the medium. <ref> [CH92] </ref> present a mechanism for implementing the pseudo-Bayesian algorithm in the presence of diversity and capture but global information is still required regarding the success of a transmission. Slotted ALOHA with capture is inherently unfair, [Abr77] shows that outside a particular range, the Sisyphus distance, users achieve no throughput.

For perfect capture, that is where one of any colliding cells will be received correctly, the throughput approaches the capacity of the base station and capture improves the performance of all sources in the system, not just those close to the base [GS87].

Reference-contexts: Within a building it is notoriously difficult to predict the propagation characteristics of micro-waves and this colouring of cells is a difficult problem <ref> [FFG + 93] </ref>. Colouring is also wasteful of bandwidth since in order for it be successful there must be areas between re-use of the colour in which it is idle. These inactive areas could potentially be used for transmission.

Reference-contexts: One of the main attractions of ATM is that out-of-band control and the connection oriented approach allow a Quality of Service (QoS) to be associated with each connection. Certain guarantees can be made about the performance of individual circuits because the aggregate load from all circuits can be calculated <ref> [FRV92] </ref>. Ideally the wireless network should provide the same QoS interface as the wired network, but in practice some details of the semantics are likely to be different.

Simulation of a realistic propagation model suggest that throughput of approximately half the bit-rate are achievable (see Appendix B). The combination of capture and large-scale diversity also has a large impact on the overall throughput.

Reference-contexts: There have been a large number of large-scale attenuation models proposed for in-building radio propagation <ref> [Has93] </ref> and attenuation in most of these cases is considerably greater than line-of-sight. Small cells have some drawbacks compared to larger cells. There are on average a small number of mobiles within range of any base-station so base-station cost and connectivity is critical.

Reference-contexts: A new set being made active can potentially cause renegotiation of VCs for other mobiles. In previous multi-media experiments it has been shown that application layer feedback is an important factor in coping with varying service in an interactive environment <ref> [JH93] </ref>. 2.6 Alternative Approaches If the requirement for strict compatibility with wired ATM is relaxed and a private switching network is provided between base stations an interesting possible modification to the system is possible.

Reference-contexts: A number of different back-off strategies have been proposed which stabilise ALOHA by decreasing the probability of repeating a cell as the number of repeats decreases <ref> [RJ90] </ref>. These mechanisms are much easier to implement in a diverse environment as only the local success of a transmission is used as a metric.

Reference-contexts: The combination of capture and large-scale diversity also has a large impact on the overall throughput. Increasing the number of base-stations increases the overall capacity even when the characteristics are the same at each base station <ref> [Sak92] </ref>. 11 As is well known ALOHA is inherently unstable, when high load is applied the network falls into a low throughput mode in which almost all transmission attempts are repeats.

Reference-contexts: Also, because the pico-cells overlap there is no hard boundary at which a mobile must hand-over and a form of soft hand-off is possible similar to that in the CDMA digital cellular system <ref> [Vit92] </ref>. In this scheme there is no explicit colouring of pico-cells and an access mechanism is used which is resilient to co-cell interference.
