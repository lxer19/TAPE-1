Reference-contexts: The other documents are: * "An introduction to the Aditi deductive database system" [4]. This is an overview of the Aditi system. It introduces the concepts behind Aditi and describes its structure as well as its main components. * "Aditi-Prolog language manual" <ref> [1] </ref>. This is a reference manual for the language in which users write programs for Aditi and for the interface between Aditi and NU-Prolog. * "Experiences with a flights database" [2]. This describes one application of Aditi. All four documents are distributed together with Aditi.

Reference-contexts: This is a reference manual for the language in which users write programs for Aditi and for the interface between Aditi and NU-Prolog. * "Experiences with a flights database" <ref> [2] </ref>. This describes one application of Aditi. All four documents are distributed together with Aditi. This users' guide assumes familiarity with the first of these documents and provides the background necessary for the second and third. <p> The load command also looks at the file "stops.rm", and loads the declarations in it into the query shell proper. This can be verified by the command: 2 &lt;- decs. These mode declarations are in force: <ref> [predmode (``in list'', 2, [diff, magic] </ref>, [m (1, m, i, [f, b])]), predmode (``stops'',3, [diff], [m (1, m, i, [f, f, f])])] For each predicate in "stops.al", "stops.rm" and hence decs gives its name, arity, the flags it was compiled with and information about its modes.

Reference-contexts: This will be fixed in a future version of Aditi. If you need more information about superimposed codeword indexing methods in general, for example an explanation of what choice vectors are, read <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.4 Inserting data into a relation The newrel command of course creates empty relations. The command to insert tuples into relations is "newtups": 12% newtups flight 2 Aditi 1.0: Add Tuples sydney, honolulu honolulu, toronto sydney, melbourne melbourne, honolulu ^ D 4 tuple (s) inserted Addition completed.
