Reference-contexts: The next few sections present the textual representation of CPNs, the methodology, and examples of its execution. The last sections present the conclusion, as well as the direction of future work on this topic. 2 Background Information 2.1 Coloured Petri Nets Coloured Petri Nets (HCP-nets) <ref> [1] </ref> are an extension of the well known Petri Nets. The functionality of the original Petri Nets, used for the representation of concurrent systems, has been expanded to allow for the specification of systems in a more concise and powerful model.

Reference-contexts: A standard representation is currently being worked on, but it will not be released for several years, so developing my own was one of the goals of this research paper. CPNs can be created and simulated within the Design/CPN package released by Meta Software Corporation <ref> [2] </ref>. This package allows the user to design the CPN easily and quickly, and then perform syntax checking of the net. The CPN can be executed, or simulated, to determine whether or not it performs the desired task.

Reference-contexts: Previously, my test cases have been generated by hand from existing circuit specifications. An automated transformation methodology would be invaluable to my research, liberating time to be spent in more constructive pursuits. A detailed description of my research topic can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Another question that could be asked specifically in regard to my research is "Why CPNs?" CPNs are considered good representations of digital systems because of their: (1) descriptive power; (2) existence of a rich body of theory; and (3) existence of commercial tools. <ref> [6] </ref> They have been widely used, with much success, to model processes in many different environments.

Reference-contexts: If a formal semantics of VHDL could be devised, formal verification methods could be automated.
