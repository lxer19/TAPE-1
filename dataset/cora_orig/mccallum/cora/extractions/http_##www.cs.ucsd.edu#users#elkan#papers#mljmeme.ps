Abstract: The MEME algorithm extends the expectation maximization (EM) method for identifying motifs in unaligned biopolymer sequences. The aim of MEME is to discover new motifs in a set of biopolymer sequences where little or nothing is known in advance about any motifs that may be present. MEME enhancements expand the range of problems which can be addressed by the EM algorithm and increase the probability of finding solutions. Subsequences which actually occur in the biopolymer sequences are used as starting points for the EM algorithm to increase the probability of finding globally optimal motifs. The assumption that each sequence contains exactly one occurrence of the shared motif is removed. This allows multiple appearances of a motif to occur in any sequence and permits the algorithm to ignore sequences with no appearance of the shared motif, increasing its resistance to noisy data. A method for probabilistically "erasing" shared motifs after they are found is incorporated so that several distinct motifs can be found in the same set of sequences, both when different motifs appear in different sequences and when a single sequence may contain multiple motifs. Experiments show that MEME can discover both the CRP and LexA binding sites from a set of sequences which contain one or both sites, and that MEME can discover both the 10 and 35 promoter regions in a set of E. coli sequences.

Reference-contexts: It may be possible to use the multiple models learned by MEME on passes through the dataset as features for another learning algorithm. For example, a decision tree learner such as ID3 [ Quinlan, 1986 ] or CART <ref> [ Breiman et al., 1984 ] </ref> could use the models learned by MEME on the promoter dataset as features to learn a classification rule for E. coli 30 promoters.

Reference-contexts: These models are at local maxima of the likelihood function described earlier. The correct model for the shared motif is probably given by the model which globally maximizes the likelihood function, but EM is not guaranteed to find the global maximum, on a local maximum. Previous authors <ref> [ Lawrence and Reilly, 1990; Cardon and Stormo, 1992 ] </ref> have recommended using several starting points for EM and choosing the model with the highest likelihood, but how to choose the starting points has not been discussed in detail. <p> Three of the fragments are shorter because 200 bases flanking the start position of the gene were not available. One of the samples in the LexA dataset overlaps a sample in the CRP dataset. The overlap includes the known CRP site. The promoter dataset is taken from <ref> [ Cardon and Stormo, 1992 ] </ref> . It contains 231 E. coli DNA fragments each believed to contain promoter regions.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that expectation maximization algorithms find values for the model parameters at which the likelihood function assumes a local maximum <ref> [ Dempster et al., 1977 ] </ref> . It is reasonable to assume that the correct solution to the problem of characterizing the shared motif occurs at the global maximum of the likelihood function.

Reference-contexts: MEME discovered the LexA binding site on its first pass and the CRP binding site on its second pass. The second dataset contained 231 E. coli promoter sequences <ref> [ Harley and Reynolds, 1987 ] </ref> . MEME discovered the TATAAT and TTGACA consensus sequences on the first and second passes, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Another promising idea is to use the short motifs learned by MEME to construct starting points for hidden Markov models. The innovations added to the EM algorithm in MEME can also be used with Hidden Markov models (HMMs) <ref> [ Haussler et al., 1993 ] </ref> . The idea of using subsequence-derived starting points may be adaptable for use with HMMs. The method used by MEME for probabilistically "erasing" sites after each pass would certainly be easy to add to the standard forward/backward HMM learning algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The MEME algorithm was run on two datasets. The first was a dataset combining 18 E. coli sequences containing CRP binding sites [ Lawrence and Reilly, 1990 ] and 16 sequences containing LexA binding sites <ref> [ Hertz et al., 1990 ] </ref> . MEME discovered the LexA binding site on its first pass and the CRP binding site on its second pass. The second dataset contained 231 E. coli promoter sequences [ Harley and Reynolds, 1987 ] . <p> Some of the fragments contain putative CRP binding sites which have been determined by homology only. Each fragment in the dataset contains 105 bases and the fragments are not aligned with each other in any particular way. The LexA dataset is taken from Table I in <ref> [ Hertz et al., 1990 ] </ref> . It contains 16 DNA fragments each believed to contain one or more LexA binding sites. The dataset contains 11 LexA binding sites which had been verified by DNase protection experiments when the dataset was compiled. <p> MEME prints the consensus (i.e. the most probable letter for each position in the motif as determined from freq) after each pass. The consensus after pass 1 was TACTGTATATATATACAGTA, which matches the consensus reported by <ref> [ Hertz et al., 1990 ] </ref> and is a perfect DNA palindrome. Another way of seeing how well the model that was learned during pass 1 of MEME characterizes the LexA binding sites is to plot the relative entropy score of each subsequence of the input data. <p> Another way of seeing how well the model that was learned during pass 1 of MEME characterizes the LexA binding sites is to plot the relative entropy score of each subsequence of the input data. This is done using the specificity matrix method of <ref> [ Hertz et al., 1990 ] </ref> . <p> 13 d 0.999333 a Indicates site known only by homology. b This LexA dataset sample overlaps CRP sample cole 1. c This site may not have been reported previously. d This apparent CRP site may have been confused with a LexA site in [ Varley and Boulnois, 1984 ] and <ref> [ Hertz et al., 1990 ] </ref> .

The site in colicin Ib was mentioned by [ Varley and Boulnois, 1984 ] as being either a LexA site or possibly a CRP site. <ref> [ Hertz et al., 1990 ] </ref> appear to have classified it as a LexA site.

Reference-contexts: Finally, MEME probabilistically "erases" the appearances of a site after it is found, and continues searching for further shared motifs in the dataset. The MEME algorithm was run on two datasets. The first was a dataset combining 18 E. coli sequences containing CRP binding sites <ref> [ Lawrence and Reilly, 1990 ] </ref> and 16 sequences containing LexA binding sites [ Hertz et al., 1990 ] . MEME discovered the LexA binding site on its first pass and the CRP binding site on its second pass. <p> This demonstrates the ability of MEME to avoid local optima, to tolerate large number of sequences which do not contain the motif, and to find multiple motifs in a single dataset. 2 The MEME algorithm The MEME algorithm has at its core a modified version of the EM method <ref> [ Lawrence and Reilly, 1990 ] </ref> . Refer to Figure 2 for a pseudo-code description of the MEME algorithm. In the inner loop, the EM algorithm is run repeatedly with different starting points. The starting points are derived from actual subsequences which occur in the input dataset. <p> These models are at local maxima of the likelihood function described earlier. The correct model for the shared motif is probably given by the model which globally maximizes the likelihood function, but EM is not guaranteed to find the global maximum, on a local maximum. Previous authors <ref> [ Lawrence and Reilly, 1990; Cardon and Stormo, 1992 ] </ref> have recommended using several starting points for EM and choosing the model with the highest likelihood, but how to choose the starting points has not been discussed in detail. <p> Furthermore, all other values of poff ij were below 0.17, so the model appears to be very specific for the LexA site. 4 If the best value of LSITE is not known in advance, MEME can be run repeatedly with different values. <ref> [ Lawrence and Reilly, 1990 ] </ref> addresses the question of choosing the best value of LSITE. <p> On the next pass, MEME discovers the CRP motif. The consensus pattern it reports for pass 2 is TTTTTTGATCGGTTTCACAC, which agrees well with the consensus found by the original EM algorithm and reported in <ref> [ Lawrence and Reilly, 1990 ] </ref> . More significantly, the model characterizes the CRP motif well, judging from the values of poff ij for the various positions in the samples in the dataset. Table 4 shows the values of poff ij found during pass 2 on the CRP/LexA dataset. <p> More significantly, the model characterizes the CRP motif well, judging from the values of poff ij for the various positions in the samples in the dataset.
