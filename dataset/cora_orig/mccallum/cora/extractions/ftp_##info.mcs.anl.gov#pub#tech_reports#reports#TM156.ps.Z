Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In another paper <ref> [2] </ref>, we summarized the results of an investigation into single axioms for groups and Abelian groups in terms of the following six sets of operations: fproduct, inverseg, fdivisiong, fdouble division, identityg, fdouble division, inverseg, fdivision, identityg, and fdivision, inverseg. <p> One or more new single axioms are presented for each of those twelve theories. However, <ref> [2] </ref> contains just two of proofs; we present the remaining proofs here. Throughout both papers, we use ff=fi for (right) division, ff fi 1 ; and we use ff k fi for double division, ff 1 fi 1 . The following single axioms are presented in [2].

Each of the theorems presented here states that a particular formula is a single axiom for a theory. In some of the cases, we derive a known single axiom for the theory.
