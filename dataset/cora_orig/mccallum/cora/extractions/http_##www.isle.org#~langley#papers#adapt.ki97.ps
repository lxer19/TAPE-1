Title: Machine Learning for Adaptive User Interfaces  
Author: Pat Langley

Affiliation: Intelligent Systems Laboratory Daimler-Benz Research and Technology Center  
Abstract: In this paper we examine the growing interest in personalized user interfaces and explore the potential of machine learning in meeting that need. We briefly review progress in developing fielded applications of machine learning, then consider some characteristics of adaptive user interfaces that distinguish them from more traditional applications. After this, we consider some examples of adaptive interfaces that use inductive methods to personalize their behavior, and we report some ongoing research that extends these ideas in the automobile environment.

Reference-contexts: A collection by Cypher (1993) contains a representative sample of work on programming by demonstration. Some efforts on intelligent tutoring systems also draw on machine learning with the aim of personalizing instruction. For instance, Langley and Ohlsson <ref> (1984) </ref> adapted methods for learning search-control knowledge to model individual student errors in arithmetic. Also, Anderson's (1984) technique of model tracing relies on careful observation of student behavior in the same way as generative user interfaces, giving advice only when the student diverges from acceptable paths. <p> Some efforts on intelligent tutoring systems also draw on machine learning with the aim of personalizing instruction.

Reference-contexts: However, machine learning has done more than evolve into a careful empirical science; it has also developed a successful applications methodology. Induction techniques have aided the construction of many fielded systems in science and industry on a variety of tasks. These include mechanical diagnosis <ref> (e.g., Giordana et al., 1993) </ref>, credit scoring (e.g., Michie, 1989), manufacturing control (e.g., Evans & Fisher, 1994), and scientific classification (e.g., Fayyad, Smyth, Weir, & Djorgovski, 1995). <p> Experiments showed that the system reduced keystrokes by 87 percent over an eight-month period. Although this work did not focus on personalization per se, Schlimmer and Hermens <ref> (1993) </ref> took a very similar approach in their personalizing interface for note taking. This adaptive system learns a grammar that predicts the order and content of a user's notes, aiming to reduce keystrokes and to help them organize their thoughts. <p> In general, systems in this paradigm focus on constrained tasks that support online learning from very few training cases, but they carry out induction every bit as much as ones that use less domain-specific learning algorithms.
