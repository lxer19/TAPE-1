Reference-contexts: While continuing efforts are sure to be made to improve IUE run time performance, the IUE is now within the proper order of magnitude range relative to straight C. 1 1.1 Overview of the Burns Algorithm The Burns Algorithm was first described in <ref> [BHR86] </ref>. The algorithm takes in a single image and returns straight line segments representing regions of aligned gradient orientation in the image. using the IUE. The Burns algorithm uses the following general types of objects/operations: 1. Byte Images. 2. Convolution to extract gradient magnitude and gradient orientation images. 3.
