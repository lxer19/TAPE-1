Abstract: In this paper we develop an adaptive beamsummer for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of slow fading Raleigh signals, using a new design approach, termed "Adaptive Detection/Estimation for sPecific Tasks" (ADEPT). For DOA estimation, the ADEPT method yields a weight adaptation criterion which is optimized for those weights that minimize the Cramer-Rao (CR) lower bound on achievable mean-square-error of any unbiased DOA estimator constructed on the beamsummer outputs. Simulation results are provided which show that the ADEPT DOA beamsummer yields DOA estimates whose mean-squared error (MSE) approaches that of the more complex maximum likelihood implementation.

Reference-contexts: A steepest descent algorithm can also be derived which reduces the computational load but only guarantees convergence to a local maximum of F DOA (W) <ref> [5] </ref>. A block diagram of the DOA-optimal beamsummer is shown in Figure 2. 3. NULL PICKING FOR DOA ESTIMATION We use a very simple gated null picking method to estimate the DOAs from the adaptive weights given by the above eigenmaximization algorithm. <p> In [2,5], we introduce other optimal beam-summers designed using the ADEPT method for the purposes of signal detection and estimation of constant modulus signal parameters. More extensive simulation results can be found in <ref> [5] </ref> for multiple signals and wideband beamsummer arrays.
