Title: CHARADE: a Platform for Emergencies Management Systems  
Author: F. Ricci S. Mam P. Marti V. Normand and P. Olmo 
Date: #9404-07  
Pubnum: IRST Technical Report  
Abstract: This paper describe the functional architecture of CHARADE a software platform devoted to the development of a new generation of intelligent environmental decision support systems. The CHARADE platform is based on the a task-oriented approach to system design and on the exploitation of a new architecture for problem solving, that integrates case-based reasoning and constraint reasoning. The platform is developed in an objectoriented environment and upon that a demonstrator will be developed for managing first intervention attack to forest fires.

Reference-contexts: The research on DSS has clarified the two basic dimensions of the decision process: the social dimension and the psychological dimension. The social dimension refers to the fact that decisions are always taken during processes that involve many agents at different levels in the organisation <ref> [Hackathorn et al. 81, Bui 87, Miao et al. 92] </ref>. The psychological dimension refers to the process followed by the individual in taking decisions. Classical has become the Simon's distinction of the four phases of the problem solving process: intelligence, design, choice, implementation and control [Simon 55].
