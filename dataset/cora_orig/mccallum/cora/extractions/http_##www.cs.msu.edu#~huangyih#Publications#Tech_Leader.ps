Abstract: In this work, we place a long-established distributed computing problem in a new context. Specifically, the group leader election problem is studied "inside the network," meaning that participants in the election process are network switches/routers, rather than hosts. In this context, an election protocol can take advantage of certain internal operations of the network, such as the underlying routing protocol, in order to meet stringent fault-tolerance criteria while minimizing network traffic overhead. A generic and robust solution to the problem, called the Network Leader Election (NLE) protocol, is proposed for use in networks that are based on link-state routing (LSR). The NLE protocol is "generic," in that it is independent of the leader selection policy, enabling it to support a variety of network services. The protocol is robust, for it achieves leadership consensus in the presence of adverse events, such as leader failures and network partitioning. The correctness of the protocol is proved formally. A simulation study reveals that the NLE protocol incurs low overhead in handling leader failures and in group creation. In addition, it is shown how important network functions, in both the Internet and ATM networks, can benefit from the NLE protocol. These functions include, but are not limited to, routing domain leader election, address resolution, and multicast core management.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The problem of leader election concerns the selection of a distinguished member from a set of computing systems that are interconnected by a network. This problem has been extensively studied in the context of distributed computing systems, for example, in coordinating access to shared resources <ref> [1] </ref> and in implementing fault-tolerant objects [2].

Reference-contexts: This problem has been extensively studied in the context of distributed computing systems, for example, in coordinating access to shared resources [1] and in implementing fault-tolerant objects <ref> [2] </ref>. Generally speaking, solutions to the problem are distributed "host-level" algorithms that make use of various services provided by the network, such as reliable delivery of messages, in order to monitor the working status of the established leader or cast ballots for a new leader.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we focus on three examples. First, in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks and other hierarchical networks, switches in a low-level subnetwork (called a routing domain) select a switch to represent the domain in the next routing level <ref> [6] </ref>; a solution to this domain leader election problem supports routing operations within the network. <p> The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol [11], introduced by the Internet community, is one of the most well-known LSR unicast protocols. LSR has also been adopted as the routing standard for ATM networks <ref> [6] </ref>. The proposed NLE protocol extends LSR to include group-leader binding LSAs, which are used by group members to advertise their choice of leader to the rest of the group. <p> In order to apply such protocols to larger networks, a routing hierarchy can be introduced. The combination of an LSR protocol and a routing hierarchy has been adopted by the ATM PNNI standard <ref> [6] </ref> to cope with large networks, as discussed next. 4 (a) Node X crashes. (b) The perception of the network at nodes other than X and Y . 2.2 Domain Leader Election in ATM Networks ATM is a connection-oriented communication technology that relays small fixed-size cells in hardware. <p> Within each domain on this path, intra-domain routing determines a path that comprises a series of switches that connect the two domains on either side. In the ATM Private Network-Network Interface (PNNI) standard <ref> [6] </ref>, switches in a domain use LSR to perform intra-domain routing, and elect a leader switch to represent the domain in inter-domain routing. The domain leader election problem is a special case of the network-level group leader election problem. <p> Further, to continue operation 5 in the presence of domain leader failures and network partitioning scenarios, any solution to the problem must maintain the leadership and mutual consensus properties as defined earlier. The domain leader election protocol defined in the current ATM standard <ref> [6] </ref> is LSR-based. In this protocol, each switch maintains two election-related states: leader priority and preferred leader. The former is manually configured to determine the rank of the switch. <p> This is a contradiction to the assumption about y, concluding the proof. 2 15 5 Performance Evaluation In this section, we investigate the performance of the NLE protocol in handling leader failures. Specifically, the NLE protocol is compared against the ATM domain leader election protocol <ref> [6] </ref>. In our simulations, networks comprising up to 400 switches were used. For each network size, 40 graphs were generated randomly, and two simulation sessions were conducted on each graph. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the graphs generated.

Reference-contexts: Second, many address-mapping services, such as the mapping between group addresses and member addresses <ref> [7] </ref> and the mapping between network addresses and link-layer addresses [8], use a central server approach; a solution to the server assignment problem selects a leader to undertake the server responsibilities. <p> Rather, ATM supports multicasting through point-to-multipoint unidirectional virtual channels, which require the sender to explicitly establish a connection to each destination. One approach to this problem is to use a Multicast Address Resolution Server (MARS) <ref> [7] </ref>, a central server that acts as a registry, associating IP multicast group identifiers with the ATM interfaces representing the members of the groups. <p> The MARS is queried when an IP multicast address needs to be resolved, and hosts and routers must update the MARS 19 when they join and leave groups. As a centralized solution, however, the potential for MARS failure is an important issue. The approach described in <ref> [7] </ref> is to configure nodes with the addresses of one or more backup MARS nodes that they can contact in descending order of preference. An alternative method is to use an election protocol, such as NLE, to "automatically" handle MARS failures and, just as important, accommodate network partitions.

Some prominent IP multicast protocols, such as CBT <ref> [9] </ref> and PIM [10], associate a multicast traffic transit center, or core node, with 20 each multicast group.

For historical reasons, these local status broadcasts are termed link-state 3 advertisements (LSAs) <ref> [12] </ref>. After constructing an image of the network based on received LSAs, each switch x computes a shortest path from itself to every other node in the network.

Reference-contexts: We conclude that a more reasonable goal is to study the behavior of the NLE protocol in response to a finite set of events. (Similar assumptions have been used in the "classic" LSR consensus problem, where the switches must reach consensus on network images <ref> [13] </ref>.) Precisely, let us be given a group g and a finite set of events, E, which may include network status dynamics, group membership changes, unreachability events and other objection events.

Reference-contexts: This list is usually maintained by a local membership management protocol, such as the IGMP <ref> [14] </ref>. Since every switch must send a JOIN-REQUEST to a newly elected MARS, reconstruction of member lists at the MARS can be implemented by simply augmenting each JOIN-REQUEST message from switch x to include a copy of M x .

Reference-contexts: Regarding the core/leader selection policy, we can assume 21 that the default is the random member policy <ref> [15] </ref>: whenever a member is required to select and advertise a core node (including group creation time), the member simply recommends itself. A number of other core selection policies are discussed in [15] and could be incorporated into the NLE protocol. <p> Regarding the core/leader selection policy, we can assume 21 that the default is the random member policy <ref> [15] </ref>: whenever a member is required to select and advertise a core node (including group creation time), the member simply recommends itself.
