Thus, we propose to carry out the multiplication in a wavelet basis to reduce the computational cost <ref> [1] </ref>. With appropriate wavelet basis, the decomposed matrix can be approximated to high accuracy by a sparse matrix. After the approximation, the multiplication of this sparse matrix and the decomposed vector can be reduced to O (n) operations. Consequently, the modified BCG method takes O (N ) time.

Reference-contexts: Direct solutions to the discrete Poisson equation (for irregular regions) are based on a theorem called the capacitance matrix theorem which was stated and proved in Buzbee <ref> [5] </ref>. The direct solutions using the capacitance matrix theorem employ the Fourier-Toeplitz method in combination with LU decomposition [18], the Cholesky decomposition [5] or the conjugate gradient [17] technique. <p> Direct solutions to the discrete Poisson equation (for irregular regions) are based on a theorem called the capacitance matrix theorem which was stated and proved in Buzbee <ref> [5] </ref>. The direct solutions using the capacitance matrix theorem employ the Fourier-Toeplitz method in combination with LU decomposition [18], the Cholesky decomposition [5] or the conjugate gradient [17] technique. The Fourier-Toeplitz method requires O (N log N ) time and the LU decomposition, Cholesky factorization or the conjugate gradient require O (n 3 ) = O (N p N ). <p> This algorithm is based on the generalized version of the capacitance matrix theorem that we state and prove in this section. 3.1 Capacitance Matrix Technique The Capacitance matrix technique <ref> [5] </ref> has been used to solve discrete elliptic PDEs on irregular domains for the past several decades. This technique involves expressing the stiffness matrix K as the sum of K 0 and UV T . <p> O (N log N ) numerical methods may be used to solve the linear system K 0 x = b 0 , for example, the Fourier-Toeplitz method <ref> [18, 5] </ref>. In this paper, we will present an O (N ) ADI method for solving the same. <p> In this paper, we will present an O (N ) ADI method for solving the same. As for the capacitance matrix equation, the solution depends on the dimensionality of UV T which is typically O ( p 8 In the past, Buzbee et al., <ref> [5] </ref> have used the LU decomposition (O (n 3 ) = O (N p N ) to solve the Capacitance matrix equation. We present a modified bi-conjugate gradient technique that takes O (N ) time for solving the same. <p> The Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula [8] can be applied to solve (K 0 + UV T )x = b only when K and K 0 are nonsingular. When the rank (K 0 ) = (N 1) and K is nonsingular, the capacitance matrix theorem as stated in Buzbee et al., <ref> [5] </ref> can be applied to obtain the solution. <p> Because, h 0 is translation invariant, we can obtain the solution of i in equation 11 without having to solve any of the linear systems associated with each i . For discrete Poisson equations on irregular domains, we use the standard technique of imbeding irregular domains in rectangular regions <ref> [5] </ref>. Thus, the boundary conditions can be easily incorporated into UV T . Following the three categories given above, we can choose K 0 as the discrete Laplacian operator on the doubly periodic imbedded rectangular domain. The exact form of K 0 is 12 given by. <p> Also, we can handle cases such as the SFS problem on an irregular domain with Neumann boundary conditions which specifically yields a singular K matrix. This case can not be solved using the capacitance matrix technique of Buzbee et al., <ref> [5] </ref> as mentioned in [18] because, the capacitance matrix theorem of [5] requires a nonsingular K. Our algorithm gives 27 a solution to this problem (recovers a surface) within a scale factor in depth. <p> This case can not be solved using the capacitance matrix technique of Buzbee et al., <ref> [5] </ref> as mentioned in [18] because, the capacitance matrix theorem of [5] requires a nonsingular K. Our algorithm gives 27 a solution to this problem (recovers a surface) within a scale factor in depth. The techniques presented here will be useful for fast solutions to problems in other engineering fields leading to the Poisson equation.

Reference-contexts: The Poisson equation (an elliptic PDE), when discretized leads to a large sparse linear system which may be solved by using either direct or iterative numerical methods. In the iterative solution category, we have numerous techniques namely, Gauss-Seidel <ref> [6] </ref>, successive over relaxation (SOR), conjugate gradient [8], hierarchical conjugate gradient (HCG) [19], and multigrid methods.

Reference-contexts: To be more specific, division by 0 (or a number very close to 0) may occur in computing ff k and k . These two different breakdowns may be avoided by using the look-ahead Lanczos algorithm or the quasi-minimal residual (QMR) algorithm <ref> [7] </ref>. In the above algorithm, two matrix-vector multiplications Cq k1 and Cq k1 are required in each iteration. Since the matrix C is dense, the direct multiplication will take O (N ) operations, which is not acceptable to our pursuit of an O (N ) algorithm for the Poisson equation.

Reference-contexts: The conjugate-gradient (CG) method is a very powerful iterative scheme to solve the symmetric positive definite linear system. A natural generalization of the CG-type method to solve a general nonsymmetric linear system is called the biconjugate gradient (BCG) method <ref> [13] </ref>. The linear system with the capacitance matrix is a nonsymmetric and indefinite system. The size of the capacitance matrix is determined by the rank of the matrix UV T , which contains the difference between K and K 0 . <p> Since the BCG converges in O (n) iterations, the computational complexity for the modified BCG method is O (n 2 ) = O (N). The BCG algorithm <ref> [13] </ref> for the nonsymmetric linear system Cfi = f is as follows. 0. Choose fi 0 , and set q 0 = r 0 = f Cfi 0 ; Choose ~ r 0 6= 0, and set ~ q 0 = ~ r 0 ; 1.

Reference-contexts: Braess [4] proved the convergence of the multi-grid solution to the Poisson equation on a uniform grid and showed that the results are independent of the shape of the domain as long it is polygonal and convex. Recently, Xu <ref> [27] </ref> presents a unified theory for classifying a class of iterative solution methods for symmetric positive definite problems. An abstract convergence theory is established and applied to a particular problem by specifying, a decomposition of the underlying space, and the corresponding subspace solvers. <p> With multi-grid methods, the subspaces are given by multiple coarser grids. As a direct consequence of the abstract theory, optimal convergence estimates for a given algorithm can be obtained via the estimation of only two parameters (see Xu <ref> [27] </ref> for details). Although, results for convergence of multi-grid methods for complicated domains have been discussed in Xu [27], the analysis is limited to polyhedral domains and has to be done on a case by case basis and is different for each case. <p> As a direct consequence of the abstract theory, optimal convergence estimates for a given algorithm can be obtained via the estimation of only two parameters (see Xu <ref> [27] </ref> for details).
