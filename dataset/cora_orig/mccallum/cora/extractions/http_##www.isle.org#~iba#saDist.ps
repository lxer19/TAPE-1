Abstract: We present a computational model of movement skill learning. The types of skills addressed are a class of trajectory following movements involving multiple accelerations, decelerations and changes in direction and lasting more than a few seconds. These skills are acquired through observation and improved through practice. We also review the speed-accuracy tradeoff|one of the most robust phenomena in human motor behavior. We present two speed-accuracy tradeoff experiments where the model's performance fits human behavior quite well.

Reference-contexts: This is the seemingly obvious regularity that, the faster a particular skill is attempted, the more difficult it is to perform the skill accurately. Although others discussed this phenomenon even earlier, Fitts <ref> (1954, Fitts & Peterson, 1964) </ref> was possibly the first to rigorously examine, study, and report the phenomenon. His careful studies led to the formulation of a relation, known as Fitts' law, that captures the maxim "haste makes waste" with quantitative values.

Reference-contexts: This requires and a method for incorporating new motor schemas into movement concepts stored in memory. Our method of incorporation performs partial matches between state descriptions in a new schema and those stored within a concept. The process is guided by an evaluation function, category utility <ref> (Gluck & Corter, 1985) </ref>, which was designed to account for basic-level effects. 1 This represents a simplification on our part. Alternatively, we could store only the information for the joint that triggered a break point. Although our representation handles this, our implemented mechanisms would become rather more complicated.

Reference-contexts: After considerable experience, any single misclassification will have a very small impact on the viewer-centered schema. We have extensively tested the computational aspects of Mander|in both observation and practice and have also evaluated the model in the context of several psychological phenomena <ref> (Iba, 1991a) </ref>. In this paper we emphasize Mander's explanatory and predictive power in the context of a single phenomena. Part Two: Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff Science attempts to explain and predict phenomena. These phenomena are regularities in events that, given similar situations, can be repeatedly observed. <p> When performing a skill slowly, one can make frequent adjustments, thus operating in a closed-loop mode. As the speed of the skill is increased, the performer monitors less often, thereby moving performance towards the open-loop end of this continuum. We address a number of other issues elsewhere <ref> (Iba, 1991a) </ref>. The Impact of Learning Our model's movement generation behavior at different speeds exhibits a satisfactory fit to the traditional speed-accuracy tradeoff. However, it seems natural to expect learning to affect this phenomenon.

Reference-contexts: In terms of Schmidt et al.'s (1979) tradeoff function, S = A+B (D=T ), we can interpret the different slopes of the regression lines (not shown) as a reflection of movement difficulty. 5 This notion is supported by other results <ref> (Iba, 1991b) </ref> that reveal that the asymptotic error levels for each of the movement types user here differ considerably. We believe that this tradeoff demonstrates the continuum between open-loop and closed-loop behavior (Stel-mach, 1982), which reflects the amount of monitoring that occurs during movements.

Reference-contexts: For this paper we mention only a few of the psychologically motivated assumptions. First, we assume that the joint angles of the agent's effectors can (effectively) be directly controlled by "setting" the positions of limbs independent of feedback <ref> (Kelso, 1982) </ref>. We also assume that motor schemas are invariant with respect to time. That is, a single representation can be used to recognize and execute a movement at different speeds.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the subject is required to enact a movement to a target at a fixed distance D, but must match the duration of the movement to a target time T . This temporally constrained task <ref> (Meyer, Abrams, Kornblum, Wright, & Smith, 1988) </ref> yields a quite different tradeoff relation.

Reference-contexts: Computational models of skilled movement can help us test and refine these theories. Our model, Mander, is geared toward the trajectory following task. Movements of this type include Tai-Chi exercises and figure skating compulsories. Despite the need to understand the primitive building blocks of human motor behavior <ref> (Rosenbaum, 1991) </ref>, we assume such primitives are available for constructing complicated movements and focus on the representation, acquisition, and improvement of complex movements of longer duration. The paper proceeds in two parts. <p> We assume the existence of a memory structure called the motor buffer. This is analogous to a pre-perceptual store (Sperling, 1960) that has rapid decay, thereby allowing limited access. Finally, we assume that approximately 100-200 msec. are required before alterations to an ongoing movement can be initiated <ref> (Rosenbaum, 1991) </ref>. Recognizing Observed Movements Recall that our motor schema representation for movements stores only a few points in time for a given movement. The movement parser is responsible for selecting invariant event points that are used for recognition, memory organization, and retrieval.

Reference-contexts: Oxbow2 extends the previous work to deal with temporally structured objects that have differing numbers of components described with attributes having real values. A concept in Oxbow2 covers one or more specific movements and is stored as a probabilistic description <ref> (Smith & Medin, 1981) </ref>. This is one way that generality is introduced. Also, a movement concept consists of a viewer-centered component and a joint-centered component. Each of these in turn are made up of state descriptions describing the movement traces.
