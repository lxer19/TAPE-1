Title: EGRET Observations and GLAST Expectations for GeV Astronomy

Abstract: About one quarter of the over 200 EGRET sources are also significantly detected above 1 GeV. Many of these sources are detected with only 10-20 photons, so very little is known about their spectra or variability above 1 GeV. However, the combination of fluxes and upper limits of sources either detected by EGRET or ground-based TeV detectors (e.g. Mrk 501 or BL Lac) indicate changes in the spectra between GeV and TeV energies. GLAST, the follow on telescope to EGRET, has recently been added to the NASA Office of Space Sciences Strategic Plan with a launch date in 2004. GLAST will have more observing time per source due to the larger field of view, and over an order of magnitude more effective area above 10 GeV than EGRET. Therefore, the sources EGRET has detected above 1 GeV will have sufficient flux to measure spectra and study variability. And for the bright sources, which are known to exist from EGRET observations, the spectra of satellite-based and ground-based gamma-ray observatories will overlap, allowing measurement of cross calibrated spectra from 10s of MeV to 10s of TeV.
