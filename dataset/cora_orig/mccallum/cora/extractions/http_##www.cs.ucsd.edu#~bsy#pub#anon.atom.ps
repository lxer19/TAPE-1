Reference-contexts: The obvious question is: are anonymous atomic transactions possible? [16] This has been an open question. Our first attempt to solve this question would be to use standard techniques to make a digital cash transaction atomic. The standard method for doing this is two-phase commitment <ref> [1, 9, 10, 11, 12] </ref>. In short, in two-phase commitment, one party assumes the role of transaction coordinator. That party 2 knows and records the identities of all other parties in a non-volatile log. Each of the parties records its state before the transaction begins.

Reference-contexts: Most types of variations will either reveal the consumer's identity, allow a new type of fraud, be subject to ambiguous results if a message is not delivered, or have other undesirable effects. This topic was addressed at length in <ref> [4, 16, 17] </ref>. * She can wait and not spend the money. But in this case, the consumer has locked up her funds. <p> In this section, with the aid of a table, we detail what information is obtained by various agents. Table 1 gives the types of information available to various parties in the style of <ref> [4] </ref>. The entries for the merchant, the consumer, the bank, and the transaction log are based on their original information plus any information received over the course of a transaction.

Reference-contexts: The method used to implement this security (e.g. public keys) is not important to the functioning of the protocol. Some messages could be left unsecured, improving efficiency at the cost of a limited loss of privacy, but the details of this are not currently addressed. 4 Chaum <ref> [6] </ref> made a critical discovery that enabled the idea of digital cash to take place: blinded tokens. The use of blinded tokens is essential to our protocols. A token is a piece of data which can be created only by a specific issuer.

Reference-contexts: But in this case, the consumer has locked up her funds. If the merchant did not receive her payment, then the consumer may be waiting for a very long time! A standard approach to addressing the question of reliability is the notion of ACID (atomic, consistent, isolated, durable) transactions <ref> [10] </ref>. In the distributed systems community, ACID transactions have been widely adopted as the standard mechanism for realizing distributed transactions. ACID transactions are the payment transactions should be failure-atomic, so that failures in parts of the system will not leave the entire system in some ambiguous, intermediate state. <p> The obvious question is: are anonymous atomic transactions possible?

Each of the parties records its state before the transaction begins. <p> For example, authorization denotes the authorization action by the party identified in the subscript.

B (n; expiration; M; L; Q fl ) q | authorization q P3. B ! M (n; expiration; M; L; value) b | authorization b P4.

Reference-contexts: The time-stamps used should include clock time information, since transaction authorization expiration will be in terms of real time. In order to reduce the trust that the parties must place in the log's honesty, cryptographic time-stamping <ref> [13] </ref> may also be employed.

How can we interpret these transactions in the context of electronic commerce? Tygar <ref> [16] </ref> has proposed using the classification below. Tygar began by assuming a model where consumers are purchasing electronic goods and services that will be delivered over a network (such as WWW page, for example). <p> If there is a dispute, this evidence can be shown to a judge to prove exactly what goods were delivered. Using this classification, we can see that the simplified digital cash protocol described above is not money atomic.

Our first attempt to solve this question would be to use standard techniques to make a digital cash transaction atomic.

Section 2 explains our basic cryptographic and system assumptions. <p> In variants where Q may be reused, the log entries should be encrypted to prevent unassociated parties from linking the repeated uses of Q. 9 Conclusion In this paper, we presented protocols for achieving anonymous atomic transactions, answering an open question <ref> [16] </ref>. As stated in the introduction, these protocols are not being proposed for use in their current form.
