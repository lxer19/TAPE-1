Abstract: The Pierre Auger Fluorescence Detector is designed to monitor extensive air showers of energies greater than 10 19 eV. We present a hierarchical trigger-system with hardware and software components for efficient data reduction and event recognition. The first-level trigger uses configurable hardware to allow a flexible and very effective background suppression, in minimum a factor 239 larger than conventional approaches as used in the HiRes experiment. The solution is based on a field programmable gate array design simulated and optimized in a high level hardware description language (VHDL). The design for one mirror could be synthesized in one FPGA with about 40000 gates. Due to the excellent noise suppression in the first-level trigger, a software based solution on a digital signal proces sor is sufficient for the second- and third-level trigger.
