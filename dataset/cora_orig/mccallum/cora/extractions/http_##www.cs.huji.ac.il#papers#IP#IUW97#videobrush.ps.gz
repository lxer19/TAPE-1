Abstract: As the field of view of a picture is much smaller than our own visual field of view, it is common to paste together several pictures to create a panoramic mosaic having a larger field of view. While scissors and glue are the tools used in film photography, more sophisticated methods were enabled with digital video.

Reference-contexts: There are two reasons for that selection: * Alignment is usually better at the center than at the edges of the pictures. * Image distortion is minimal at the center of the images. This selection corresponds to the Voronoi tessellation <ref> [3] </ref>. Using the Voronoi tessellation for image cut-and-paste also served to minimize visible misalignment due to lens distortions. Voronoi tessellation causes every seam to be at the same distance from the two corresponding image centers.

Reference-contexts: These seams should be eliminated in order to get a seamless panorama. The process of blending the different images into a seamless panorama must smooth all these illumination discontinuities, while preserving image sharpness. A method that fulfills this requirement is described in <ref> [4] </ref>. In this approach, the images are decomposed into band-pass pyramid levels, and then combined at each band-pass pyramid level.

Reference-contexts: Since it is not simple to ensure a pure rotation around the optical center, such mosaics are used only in limited cases. In more general camera motions, that may include both camera translations and camera rotations, more general transformation for image alignment are used <ref> [5, 8, 12, 16, 9] </ref>. In all cases images are aligned pairwise, using a parametric transformation like an affine transformation or planar-projective transformation. A reference frame is selected, and all images are aligned with this reference frame and combined to create the panoramic mosaic.

Reference-contexts: This is approximately the case with some satellite images.

Reference-contexts: projection is very different from a perspective projection in the sense that far-away objects do not appear smaller than close-by objects. 3 Image Alignment Simulation of scene sweeping by a plane from a given video sequence can be done once the full 3D motion of the camera ("ego-motion") is known <ref> [11] </ref>. However, the implementation of the manifold projection described in this paper uses only 2D alignment, rather than using full ego-motion analysis. Nevertheless, results are impressive in most cases.
