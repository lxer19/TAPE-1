Abstract: A fundamental concern in building a secure distributed system is authentication of local and remote entities in the system. We survey authentication issues in distributed system design. Two basic paradigms underlying the design of authentication protocols are presented. We then propose an authentication framework that can be used for designing secure distributed systems, including specific protocols for secure bootstrapping, user-host authentication, and peer-peer authentication. We conclude with an overview of two existing authentication systems, namely, Kerberos and SPX.

Reference-contexts: x if y is an encryption key, and the decryption operation on x if y is a decryption key. (In the case of a symmetric cryptosystem with identical encryption and decryption keys, the operation should be clear from the context.) Two widely used cryptosystems are the Data Encryption Standard (DES) <ref> [2] </ref>, a symmetric system, and RSA [3], an asymmetric system. In RSA, encryption-decryption key pairs satisfy the following commutative property [1]: 8m 2 M : 8 (k; k 1 ) 2 K E fi K D : ffmg k 1 g k = m (C2) hence yielding a signature capability.

Reference-contexts: Host compromise threats can be countered by a combination of hardware techniques (like processor protection modes) and software techniques (like security kernel/reference monitor). These techniques are outside the scope of this paper, we refer interested readers to <ref> [4] </ref> for an overview of the area of computer systems security. In this paper, we assume that each host implements a reference monitor that can be trusted to properly segregate processes. The second type, communication compromise, includes threats associated with message communications. <p> More precisely, an encrypted message provides no information regarding the original message, hence guaranteeing secrecy; and an encrypted message, if tampered, would not decrypt into an understandable message, hence guaranteeing integrity. Replay of old messages can be countered by using nonces or timestamps <ref> [4, 11] </ref>. A nonce is information that is guaranteed fresh, that is, it has not appeared or been used before. Therefore, a reply that contains some 3 function of a recently sent nonce should be believed timely because the reply could have been generated only after the nonce was sent. <p> A formal description of a cryptosystem includes specifications for its message, key, ciphertext spaces, and encryption and decryption functions. There are two broad classes of cryptosystems, symmetric and asymmetric <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. In the former, the encryption and decryption keys are the same and hence must be kept secret. In the latter, the encryption key differs from the decryption key, and only the decryption key must be kept secret. The encryption key, however, can be made public.
