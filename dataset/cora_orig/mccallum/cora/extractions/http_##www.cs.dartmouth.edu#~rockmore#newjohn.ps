Title: Numerical Investigation of the Spectrum for Certain Families of Cayley Graphs  
Author: John Lafferty and Daniel Rockmore 
Date: August 1, 1992  
Abstract: In this paper we extend some earlier computations [8]. In particular, the expanding behavior of Cayley graphs of PSL 2 (F 107 ) is compared with that of the Cayley graphs for the group A 10 . These computations support the (up to now) unvoiced conjecture of Lubotzky that the symmetric groups and projective linear groups have asymptotically different average expanding behavior. We also give a thorough spectral analysis for a natural family of Cayley graphs which does not admit analysis by Selberg's theorem.

Reference-contexts: Let 1 N1 k denote the eigenvalues of X. The second-largest eigenvalue of X, denoted 1 (X), is defined to be 1 = max j i j : Various connectivity properties of a graph can be judged by studying its spectrum (see e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>). Bounds for the diameter, expansion coefficient, and chromatic number all can be given in terms of 1 . For details and references we refer the reader to other papers in this volume as well as the books ([9], [11]).

Reference-contexts: In this section we give a very quick introduction and explanation of the rep resentation theory of SL 2 (F p ), PSL 2 (F p ) and A n . In-depth treatments can be found in <ref> [4] </ref> for A n and [10] for SL 2 (F p ) and PSL 2 (F p ). 3.1 Representation theory for the alternating group The representation theory of the alternating groups is most easily explained by using the representation theory of the symmetric groups. <p> There is a natural way in which to pick out a specific irreducible component of M , called the Specht module, and denoted S . It is the action of S n on S which gives the irreducible representation associated to : For details see <ref> [4] </ref>. By restriction, any representation of S n , gives a representation of A n . It turns out that most of the remain irreducible upon restriction. If ` n, then the dual partition, denoted 0 is the partition associated to the tranpose of the diagram for .

Reference-contexts: In brief, this is done by checking the orbit structure of the action of the generators (lifted to SL 2 (F p )) on the projective line, where the action should be transitive.

Reference-contexts: It is well-known that if a pair of elements of SL 2 (F p ) is chosen at random, then with high probability (approaching 1 as p goes to infinity, at a rate of roughly 1 O (log 2 p=p)) these elements will generate SL 2 (F p ) <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For the symmetric groups, our understanding of the asymptotics of numerical spectral analysis is less well-developed. A serious computational consideration for the symmetric groups is that the degrees of the irreducible representations grow quickly <ref> [7] </ref>. Thus, the determination of the eigenvalues soon dominate the computation. The symmetric group S 10 is still computationally tractable from this point of view (with largest irreducible representation of degree 768). Its size is comparable with SL 2 (F p ) for p = 107.

Reference-contexts: When the graphs of interest are Cayley graphs, techniques from Fourier analysis are especially useful in this analysis. In this paper we extend the analysis of <ref> [8] </ref> by presenting two different computations. The first computation gives an analysis of the spectrum of the Cayley graphs of SL 2 (F p ) on the generating sets n 0 1 ; 1 0 o n 0 1 ; 1 0 o . <p> Consequently, for the latter pair, the often useful techniques of Selberg's theorem are of no help in studying the asymptotic spectral behavior of the graphs. Our results in this first computation give further evidence for speculations presented in our earlier work (cf. <ref> [8] </ref>, Section 6). The second computation compares the average expanding behavior of Cayley graphs of PSL 2 (F 107 ) with that of A 10 . <p> In <ref> [8] </ref> this led us to consider the following question: if two elements a; b are chosen uniformly from SL 2 (F p ) subject to the constraint that ha; bi = SL 2 (F p ), then what can be said about 1 (SL 2 (F p ); fa; bg)? 1 <p> The results showed a marked clustering away from 1, roughly between 0.865 and 0.890. (For details as well as the graph, see <ref> [8] </ref>, Section 5.3.) The clustering of the these eigenvalues naturally suggests that one should be able to prove that asymptotically, almost every generating pair of SL 2 (F p ) is a good expander ([8], Section 6, Question 4). <p> Under this identification, the set f j fIg ker ()g gives a complete set of inequivalent irreducible representations of PSL 2 (F p ). As for the symmetric group, the irreducible representations for SL 2 (F p ) may be effciently constructed. Explicit contructions are given in <ref> [8] </ref>, using the discussions in [10] and [12]. In short, all representations of the principal series can be constructed as induced 1-dimensional representations from B and as such are essentially in 1-1 correspondence with the characters of the diagonal subgroup, or split torus. <p> Even more than this appears to be true, as computation shows that if only the eigenvalues in a single Fourier transform are considered, then they are in fact generic, in the sense that if displayed as in Figure 3, they would yield similar pictures. See <ref> [8] </ref>, Section 6, Question 2. Computational considerations for generating these graphs may be found in [8], Sections 3 and 4. 5 Distribution of 1 for A 10 and PSL 2 (F 107 ) In this section we compare the distribution of 1 for all 3-regular Cayley graphs for the group A <p> See <ref> [8] </ref>, Section 6, Question 2. Computational considerations for generating these graphs may be found in [8], Sections 3 and 4. 5 Distribution of 1 for A 10 and PSL 2 (F 107 ) In this section we compare the distribution of 1 for all 3-regular Cayley graphs for the group A 10 with that of all 3-regular Cayley graphs for the comparably sized PSL 2 (F <p> While it is known by elementary combinatorial arguments that general random graphs are expanders, little is known about the behavior for Cayley graphs of the classical finite groups. The computation described in this section naturally extends the investigations of <ref> [8] </ref>, where it was seen that 4-regular graphs for SL 2 (F p ) tend to have expansion coefficient close to the Ramanujan bound for p larger than 100. <p> In brief, this is done by checking the orbit structure of the action of the generators (lifted to SL 2 (F p )) on the projective line, where the action should be transitive. This is explained fully in <ref> [8] </ref>. For G = A n , we use the fact [5] that if a permutation group on n &gt; 5 points is transitive on 4-sets (4-homogeneous), then outside of a few exceptions, the group is either A n or S n . <p> In our current implementation, working with representations of the discrete series is more computationally intensive by a factor of p than working with those of the principal series. Thus, the eigenvalues were computed only from the principal series. This approximation was justified by our experience <ref> [8] </ref> that the principal and discrete series representations are essentially identical from the point of view of spectral analysis of Cayley graphs. <p> of generating pairs is 1496 for this involution, while there are only 82 such classes for the involution (12)(34)(56)(78). 8 Finally, it has been observed that the action of SL 2 (F p ) on the projective line approximates the action of SL 2 (F p ) on itself ([2], <ref> [8] </ref>). That is, SL 2 (F p ) acts naturally on P 1 (F p ). <p> In particular, it would be of interest to determine whether or not a k-regular Cayley graph for PSL 2 (F p ) is a good expander with high probability as p ! 1. In addition, we have observed <ref> [8] </ref> that the action of PSL 2 (F p ) on itself is closely approximated by its action on the projective line P 1 (F p ), but an analogous statement is perhaps not true for A n .

Reference-contexts: In a similar vein is an open question concerning the expanding behavior of the symmetric groups. In <ref> [9] </ref> Lubotzky asks the question, can the family of symmetric groups be made into a family of expanders for any set of generators?. Recent work seems to indicate that the answer to this question may be no.

From a computational point of view, the discrete series representations are much more expensive to construct. However, our experience has shown that the spectral properties of the principal and discrete series representations are almost identical.
