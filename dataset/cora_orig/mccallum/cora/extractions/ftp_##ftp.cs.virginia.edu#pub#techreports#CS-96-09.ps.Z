Title: Improved Approximations of Maximum Planar Subgraph  
Author: Alexander Zelikovsky 
Keyword: Combinatorial problems, approximation algorithms, planar subgraph.  
Abstract: The maximum planar subgraph problem (MPSP) asks for a planar subgraph of a given graph with the maximum total cost. We suggest a new approximation algorithm for the weighted MPSP. We show that it has performance ratio of 5/12 in the case of graphs where the maxumum cost of an edge is at most twice the minimum cost of an edge. For the variant of MPSP that asks for an outerplanar graph, the algorithm suggested is the first with the higher performance ratio (7/12 instead of 1/2).

This means that there is a constant * &gt; 0 such that unless P = N P , there is no polynomial-time approximation algorithm for MPSP with the performance ratio 1 *. <p> Unfortunately, it was shown in [7] that this heuristic and minimum spanning tree based heuristics cannot guarantee that the output graph costs more than one third of the optimal one. Better heuristics for the unweighted MPSP have been recently appeared in <ref> [4] </ref>. They found the best and approximately best 3-block trees. A graph is a 3-block tree if any its 2-connected component (block) has at most three vertices. It was proved that performance ratios of these heuristics are at least 7 18 and 2 5 , respectively. <p> The unweighted case was considered in <ref> [4] </ref>. They proved that in any outerplanar graph there is a 3-tree which contains at least two thirds of the total number of edges. In this section we will prove that the same fact is true for the weighted case.
