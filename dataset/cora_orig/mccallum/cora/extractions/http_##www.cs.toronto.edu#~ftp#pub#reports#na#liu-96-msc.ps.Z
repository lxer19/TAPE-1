It can be used to value quite general derivative securities, and to obtain an exact formula by taking the limit, in the case that the lattice solution converges to a continuous-time solution [8], [10]. <p> average at the node S k1;j1 (see at the node S k1;j is node S k1I;max with max = min [j; k 1 I]; (4.31) and the beginning node for the path that gives the minimum average at the node S k1;j1 is node S k1I;min with min = max <ref> [j 1 I; 1] </ref>: (4.32) From this information we have A max IA max I A min IA min I where A max k1;j is the maximum average at S k1;j , A min k1;j1 is the minimum average at S k1;j1 , S k1I;max is the beginning node for the

Reference-contexts: Based on n replications, an CHAPTER 3. NUMERICAL METHODS 40 unbiased estimator of the price of a call option with strike K is given by c = n i=1 1 n X e rT maxf0; S (i) In this context, the method of antithetic variates <ref> [4] </ref> is based on the observation that if Z i has a standardized normal distribution, then so does (Z i ). The price ^ S T obtained from (3.57) with Z i replaced by (Z i ) is thus a valid sample from the terminal stock price distribution.

Reference-contexts: Generating n replications of ^ (1) may be more expensive than generating n replications of ^ (2) . So smaller variance is not sufficient ground for preferring one estimator over another <ref> [5] </ref>. Boyle et al. [5] give a good discussion of this issue. Suppose the work required to generate one replication of ^ (j) is a constant b j , j=1, 2. <p> Generating n replications of ^ (1) may be more expensive than generating n replications of ^ (2) .

Suppose the work required to generate one replication of ^ (j) is a constant b j , j=1, 2. Within computing time t, the number of replications of ^ (j) that can be generate is about t=b j . <p> Indeed, a large value of S (i) T resulting from a large Z i will be paired with a small value of ^ S (i) obtained from (Z i ). A more detailed argument can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. The technique of moment matching was proposed by Barraquand [2]. We again use the pricing of a European call option introduced in (3.57) as an example. Let Z i ; i = 1; :::; n, denote the independent standard normals used to drive a simulation. <p> Hence, the corresponding ~c i are biased estimators for the true option value. For most financial problems of practical interest, this bias is likely to be small. However, the bias can be arbitrarily large in extreme circumstances <ref> [5] </ref>. The moment matching method is an example of the idea "use what you know". In this simple European option example, the mean and variance of the terminal stock price S T are also known. <p> Standard errors are estimated based on m = 1000 simulations for each case. The results are consistent with the results in the Table 1 in <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> Note that the standard errors depend on the choices of the seeds and are not exactly the same as the results reported in <ref> [5] </ref>. From Table 3.5 we can see that the variance reduction techniques work well. Of course, the techniques with smaller standard errors require more computation. This is a complex problem and we defer a deeper analysis of this topic to a later date. <p> Here we implement the subgroup approach only since numerical results show the subgroup approach gives better results than the whole group approach <ref> [5] </ref>. The numerical results of our simulation are shown in Table 4.1. <p> Our numerical results are consistent with those in <ref> [5] </ref>. CHAPTER 4.

Reference-contexts: Finally we note C c (2.11) since American options provide more rights (early exercise) than the corresponding European options. However, it can be shown that an American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock is worth the same as the corresponding European option on the same stock <ref> [12] </ref>. That is, C = c: (2.13) CHAPTER 2. <p> On the other hand, it may be optimal under some circumstances to exercise an American put option on a non-dividend-paying stock early <ref> [12] </ref>. <p> The return of an asset is defined to be the change in the price of the asset divided by the original price. A model of stock price behavior is usually expressed as a Wiener process, which is a particular type of Markov process <ref> [12] </ref>. The behavior of a random variable, X, which follows a Wiener process, can be understood by considering the changes in its value in small intervals of time. Consider a small interval of time of length t and define X as the change in X during t. <p> There are no dividends during the life of the derivative security. 5. There are no risk-free arbitrage opportunities. 6. Trading of the underlying asset can take place continuously. 7. Short selling is permitted and the assets are divisible. Here we follow the deviation in <ref> [12] </ref>. Suppose that under the above assumptions we have a derivative security whose value f (S; t) depends only on S and t. Using CHAPTER 2. <p> u 2 + (1 p)S 2 d 2 S 2 [pu + (1 p)d] 2 (3.27) e 2rt (e 2 t 1) = pu 2 + (1 p)d 2 [pu + (1 p)d] 2 ; (3.28) where the left side of (3.27) is the variance of the continuous random walk <ref> [12] </ref> and the right side of (3.27) is the variance of the discrete random walk.

Reference-contexts: Hull and White <ref> [13] </ref> propose a tree method, which we describe below, for pricing path-dependent options. Assume the underlying asset price for an Asian option follows a log-normal random walk. Then we can build a binomial tree, as shown in Figure 4.1, similar to the one exhibited in Chapter 3. <p> At level 1, the underlying asset is the current price of the underlying asset. That is, S 1;1 = S. According to <ref> [13] </ref>, the payoff of an Asian call option at maturity is max i=1 S i;k i K; 0 ; (4.6) CHAPTER 4. <p> So at the expiry date there are 2 N paths. It is impractical to keep all the paths and their corresponding averages of the underlying asset prices at each level of the tree as shown in Figure 4.1, so Hull and White propose an approximate method <ref> [13] </ref>. At each level i of the tree the maximum and minimum averages of the underlying asset price are computed first. <p> From Table 4.2 we note that our numerical results are consistent with the results in <ref> [13] </ref>. It should be noted that the values of American-style options are always greater than the values of the corresponding European-style options which means that it may be optimal to exercise Asian options early. <p> Hull and White <ref> [13] </ref> note that an important open problem is how to price Asian options whose averaging period is less than the life of the option. We address this problem here. CHAPTER 4. <p> The option prices for different maturities and exercise prices are shown in Table 4.3. From Table 4.3, we see that, if the averaging periods are chosen as long as the maturities of the options, we get the same results as Hull and White <ref> [13] </ref>. When the averaging periods are shorter than the corresponding maturities, our results are CHAPTER 4. <p> 1 ; k 2 ; :::; k J ) is the path of the underlying asset process and J satisfies (J 1)t = t: (4.26) Note that when T avg = T , these two kinds of options become the European-style and American-style Asian options Hull and White study in <ref> [13] </ref>. To extend the Hull and White tree method for these two kinds of Asian options, CHAPTER 4. PRICING PATH-DEPENDENT OPTIONS 59 we follow the steps outlined below. 1. Build a Tree. <p> CONCLUSION 66 with which to compare the results from our method. Since we use different data structures in implementing our tree method, our method is more efficient than the straight-forward Hull and White tree method described in <ref> [13] </ref>. 5.2 Future Work We studied different numerical methods for pricing options and provided some simple illustration of the schemes. But little work has been done in analyzing the accuracy and efficiency of different approaches. We intend to examining these questions later.

Reference-contexts: To test our crude Monte Carlo method, we use the following steps. 1. Produce a random series with standard normal distribution. The code used here comes from <ref> [20] </ref>. 2. Compute the stock price at the expire date, T , using equation (3.57). 3. Compute the price of a European call option, maxfS T K, 0g. 4. Take the arithmetic average of the sample prices of the European call option.

Reference-contexts: Here we demonstrate the put-call parity by following the argument in <ref> [23] </ref>. Suppose that at time t = 0 we buy one asset and one European put option on the CHAPTER 2.

An American option is a path-dependent option since there is a positive probability of the option being exercised before expiry and thus ceasing to exist. An American early exercise feature turns any option into a potentially path-dependent option <ref> [23] </ref>. A lookback option has a payoff which depends not only on the asset price at expiry but also on the maximum or the minimum of the underlying asset price over some time prior to expiry. Asian options are path-dependent exotic options. <p> Standard option models, such as the Black-Scholes approach, rely upon the assumption of log-normality.
