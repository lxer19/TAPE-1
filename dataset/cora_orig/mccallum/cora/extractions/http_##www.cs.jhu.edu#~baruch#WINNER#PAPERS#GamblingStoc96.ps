Abstract: In this paper, we formulate and provide optimal solutions for a broad class of problems in which a decision-maker is required to select from among numerous competing options. The goal of the decision-maker is to select the option that will have the best future performance. This task is made difficult by the constraint that the decision-maker has no way to predict the future performance of any of the options. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the decision-maker can still (at least in several important scenarios) pick a winner with high probability. Our result has several applications. For example, consider the problem of scheduling background jobs on a network of workstations (NOW) when very little is known about the future speed or availability of each workstation. In this problem, the goal is to schedule each job on a workstation which will have enough idle capacity to complete the job within a reasonable or specified amount of time. This task is complicated by the fact that any particular workstation might become saturated by higher priority jobs shortly after one of our jobs is assigned to it, in which case progress will not be made on our job. Thus, in order to complete the jobs within a specified amount of time, we need to be able to accurately guess (or predict) which workstations will be idle and when. Somewhat surprisingly, it is possible to make such guesses with a very high degree of accuracy, even though very little is assumed about the future availability of the workstations. For example, if at least k of n workstations will be available for at least D units of time each (spread out over some interval of I units of time), then with probability at least 1O(1=n), we will be able to complete k log n jobs with duration (D= log n) within the interval. The result holds for all k, d, n, and I, and only knowledge of n is needed in order to schedule the tasks. For small values of k, the result is far superior to the (seemingly optimal) "dart-throwing" approach in which each job is assigned to a random workstation in the hope that it will be idle. Our results can also be used to provide the first competitive algorithm for the video-on-demand scheduling problem as well as the more general on-line set cover problem. The results may also be of interest in the context of investment planning, strategic planning, and other areas where it is important to be able to predict the future moves of an adversary or a market.

Reference-contexts: to assume that the return of the off-line player is (k log n) in order to guarantee that Alice will be O (log n log m k ) competitive. 1.3.1 Video-on-Demand Scheduling The disjoint version of the set cover problem is also equivalent to the "video-on-demand" scheduling problem posed in <ref> [AGH94] </ref>. In this problem, customers issue requests for movies (which will start at a prearranged later time) to a video server with limited capacity k. Each customer demand is immediately accepted or rejected. If the demand is accepted, that movie must be shown. <p> If the demand is accepted, that movie must be shown. If the demand is rejected, the customer is lost. The goal is to be able to accept the largest number of demands subject to the capacity constraint k. The on-line algorithms in <ref> [AGH94] </ref> achieve linear (O (m)) competitive ratio; the semi-o*ine algorithms with look-ahead (where the decision can be postponed to the time when future demand is known) achieve logarithmic ratio. In this case, the movies correspond to the sets, and the customers correspond to the base elements.

In contrast, the positive nature of the results in this paper are possible because we consider a different adversary and objective function.
