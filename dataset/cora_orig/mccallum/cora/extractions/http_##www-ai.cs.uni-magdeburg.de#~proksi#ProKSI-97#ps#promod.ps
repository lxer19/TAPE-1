Abstract: In recent years, growing ecological concern has prompted for `design for environment'. One way to achieve this is to design products that are easy to disassemble, because this improves the ability to reuse or recycle parts of a product. This paper presents a computational theory for product modeling and reasoning about product disassembly. This theory, implemented in the PROMOD system, is based on an ontology of different connection types between product components. For the task of reasoning about disassembly, the standard topological relation that expresses that two objects are connected or in contact proves to be inadequate. We therefore introduce, within a topological context, a small number of new ontological primitives concerning the rigidness of connections and the constrained degrees of freedom, which in effect are task-oriented abstractions of geometric and physical-chemical properties of products. On this basis, it is demonstrated that one can automatically generate all feasible product disassembly sequences, and in addition perform an ecological cost-benefi t analysis. The latter provides a preference order over disassembly sequences, allowing to compare alternative product designs for recycling and reuse. Finally, we show how the proposed ontology for disassembly is an extension of existing ontologies dealing with physical systems, and is based on the same ontology design principles. fl This work has been carried out as part of the SUSTAIN project, with PRe Product Ecology Consultants and ECN as partners, and partially supported by the SENTER-IT Programme of the Nether-lands Ministry of Economic Affairs. Helpful discussions with Mark Goedkoop (PRe) and Jan Braam (ECN) are acknowledged. We also thank Mark Goedkoop for kindly providing us with the coffee machine which we have thoroughly disassembled for the purposes of the present study.

Reference-contexts: The problem to obtain the AND/OR graph of a product has also been considered in computational (mechanical) engineering, and several approaches are reported in the literature. In the reversed fi shbone approach <ref> [ Ishii and Lee, 1996 ] </ref> , the designer has to come up with the preferred way to disassemble the product him/herself. This is graphically specifi ed in a reversed fi shbone diagram which can be considered as a subgraph of the AND/OR graph.

Reference-contexts: This makes this method less suited for comparing alternative designs. A method to obtain the AND/OR graph automatically is to generate it from a geometric model of the product. This is done in the degrees of freedom (Dof) approach <ref> [ Khosla and Mattikali, 1989 ] </ref> where a 3D CAD drawing of the product is utilized. After a design modifi cation the AND/OR graph can automatically be recomputed, but the drawback is that it needs extensive input information, which is not always available in the early stages of product design.
