Abstract: Market mechanisms evolved in a human social context where they are part of a highly effective and robust practice of distributed decision making concerning the allocation of resources and coordination of economic activity. Recently there has been more interest in applying market organization to computational systems. This paper defines and discusses some concepts related to the operation of markets, focusing on the role of mechanisms. A distinction is introduced between natural and programmed markets. The differences are discussed, with examples drawn from recent computer science literature.

Reference-contexts: Although market equilibria had long been postulated on the basis of empirical evidence and reasoned argument, an important result <ref> [1] </ref> was to prove the mathematical existence of such equilibria in a model of acceptable realism. It has also been shown that any Pareto optimum is reachable in a competitive economy from some set of initial conditions [2].

Reference-contexts: It has also been shown that any Pareto optimum is reachable in a competitive economy from some set of initial conditions <ref> [2] </ref>. These are both reassuring results suggesting that the basic market equilibration principle behaves sensibly in allocating goods according to utility, and that socially optimal allocations can be reached by markets (although perhaps needing government intervention to perturb the initial conditions).

Reference-contexts: Markets have a structure which lends itself to distribution, and dynamic equilibration is a principle that has proven useful in other kinds of control algorithms. A Market or economic analogy can be applied in varying strengths to develop useful new algorithms, as two further published examples indicate. Ellison <ref> [4] </ref> reported on a scheduler for the TENEX time sharing system developed in response to user complaints about unfairness. User accounts were allocated a currency income while logged on in proportion to the political clout of the account owner.

This method has the advantage of efficiency and provable convergence properties [3]. walras has been used to experiment with agent-based solutions to artificial intelligence problems. Ho et al. <ref> [5] </ref> present a framework for distributed resource allocation along loosely economic principles. The agents in the system have a concept of their own utility (as a function of resources owned), but do not maximize it. Instead, they maximize a neighborhood utility.

Reference-contexts: Real economies appear fairly stable, most of the time, given that technological and social developments are a source of constant exogenous change. Real economies and their dynamic models are also sufficiently complex that stability is difficult to analyze. This is a subject where programmed models (e.g. <ref> [6, 7, 18] </ref>) are particularly useful in study. At this point we might upgrade our working definition of a market to specify that agent deliberations and exchanges take place within a (weakly) equilibrating, dynamical system. 4. NATURAL, AUTOMATED AND PROGRAMMED MARKETS Earlier we touched on some properties of economic agents.

Reference-contexts: This scheme achieves globally optimal allocations and is simpler than natural market mechanisms. Huberman and Clearwater <ref> [8] </ref> implemented a system for controlling building air temperature that treats every thermostat as an agent in a market for thermal units. The system is structured in terms of auctions, prices and a concept of currency.

Reference-contexts: Our ferry boat owner might do well by auctioning tickets for every passage if there is a great deal of variation in the demand for transportation and the ability of customers to pay. There are many other auction variants <ref> [10] </ref>, such as sealed bid auctions and Dutch auctions where the price starts high and decreases until the first buyer accepts. These auctions are all appropriate to either a monopoly or monopsony situation where either sellers or buyers are very few, compared to the other side.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, Huberman and Hogg [9] and Miller and Drexler <ref> [11] </ref> have presented broad and intriguing arguments that automated markets have many advantages for very large and/or distributed systems. A salient point of their arguments is that market organization appears to impart robustness exactly when detailed parts of the overall system are not coordinated with one another.

Reference-contexts: environment that helps to shape outcomes: . . . expressions such as market forces, or market mechanisms, . . . refer to all the determinants, except direct government action, which help to answer the basic economic questions, such as what quantity should be provided and what should the price be. <ref> [12] </ref> More narrowly, it appears that "the market mechanism" is sometimes used to refer to the abstract skeleton of any dynamical system in which prices are a determining factor in agent decisions, which in turn drive prices. We'll look at this idea more closely in the next section.

Reference-contexts: We'll look at this idea more closely in the next section. Another special use of "mechanism" is to identify a structure for distributed decision making whose incentive properties may be designed to increase the likelihood of beneficial social outcomes. For example, a "Groves mechanism" (see <ref> [13] </ref> for a discussion) is a scheme of imposing penalties for extreme responses that provides incentives for agents to truthfully report their perceived utility from a public good, so that a policy based on those reports is likely to maximize overall social benefit.

Reference-contexts: Some inaccurate generalizations are presented where it is hoped they do not detract from drawing the distinctions of interest. The immediate object in this section is to show that "market mechanism" is a loose cover for a variety of distinct concepts. market One dictionary of economics <ref> [14] </ref> defines a market as "Generally, any context in which the sale and purchase of goods and services takes place." Another [16] says, "A medium of exchanges between buyers and sellers." Neither elaborates on the nature of "sale" or "purchase," but conventionally a sale is a transfer of possession of (or

Reference-contexts: It should be observed that social optima (e.g. maximum sum over agent utilities) are Pareto optima, but not necessarily the other way around. A typical general equilibrium model of a pure exchange economy is defined by preference functions and an initial assignment of goods to the agents (see <ref> [17] </ref> for example). A solution consists of a set of prices that meet feasibility conditions (e.g. demand does not exceed supply) and such that exchanges at those prices result in a Pareto optimal allocation of resources.

NATURAL, AUTOMATED AND PROGRAMMED MARKETS Earlier we touched on some properties of economic agents. <p> Steiglitz et al. <ref> [18] </ref> demonstrated a way in which simple heterogeneous agents can interact in a programmed market for a global effect. They constructed a simple system with one kind of producer/consumer agent where prices oscillated, leading to inefficient allocations.

The walras system of Wellman [21] is a general equilibrium model implementation that allows a problem to be programmed as a collection of agents within a market whose equilibrium allocations represent solutions. Agent utilities are local and individual, but the price discovery mechanism is novel. <p> ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This paper would never have been written without the encouragement, guidance, and critical contributions of Fran Berman to an earlier survey <ref> [19] </ref>. Fab-rizio Germano gave invaluable assistance towards understanding general equilibrium and in guidance to the economic literature. The structure and content of this version benefited greatly from comments provided by the anonymous reviewers of the earlier effort.

Reference-contexts: Prices of these resources were dynamically adjusted by a central mechanism (without action by or cognizance of the processes) to keep the swapped-in load at a reasonable level. Processes low on currency were swapped out until sufficient funds had been accumulated. Waldspurger <ref> [20] </ref> designed an elegantly simple scheme for priority-proportional resource allocation called lottery scheduling. Each process is issued a ticket whose chance of random selection to receive a resource quantum is proportional to its priority. Tickets can be split among child processes, or transferred to a server with a request.

Reference-contexts: Another observation is that when programmed markets are feasible, it seems possible to achieve better solutions with simpler mechanisms, due to issues touched on above, at least for problems of the size with which we are familiar. Also, using hardware and cryptographic solutions such as suggested by Yee <ref> [22] </ref>, it may be possible to extend effective administrative control and guarantee agent reliability in programmed markets extending over a widely distributed system, even when individual computers are under the physical control of strategically competing human parties.
