Title: Network Working Group Using Unicode with MIME Status of addition to allowing use of Unicode

Note: Request for Comments: 1641  this Memo This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. This document specifies the usage of Unicode within MIME. Motivation In  which consists largely, but not entirely, of US-ASCII characters to be represented in a way that can be read by mail clients who do not understand Unicode. This is in keeping with the philosophy of MIME. Such an encoding is described in  
Abstract: The Unicode Standard, version 1.1, and ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993(E) jointly define a 16 bit character set (hereafter referred to as Unicode) which encompasses most of the worlds writing systems. However, Internet mail (STD 11, RFC 822) currently supports only 7-bit US ASCII as a character set. MIME(RFC 1521 and RFC 1522) extends Internet mail to support different media types and character sets, and thus could support Unicode in mail messages. MIME neither defines Unicode as a permitted character set nor specifies how it would be encoded, although it does provide for the registration of additional character sets over time. Since Unicode is starting to see widespread commercial adoption, users will want a way to transmit information in this character set in mail messages and other Internet media. Since MIME was expressly designed to allow such extensions and is on the standards track for the Internet, it is the most appropriate means for encoding Unicode. RFC 1521 and RFC 1522 do not define Unicode as an allowed character set, but allow registration of additional character sets.
