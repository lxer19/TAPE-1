Title: Complete Representations in Algebraic Logic  
Author: Robin Hirsch Ian Hodkinson 
Date: March 1, 1996  
Abstract: A boolean algebra is shown to be completely representable if and only if it is atomic, whereas it is shown that neither the class of completely representable relation algebras nor the class of completely representable cylindric algebras of any fixed dimension are elementary.

Reference-contexts: PROOF: The proof uses elementary extensions and ultraproducts. Let B be any non-principal ultraproduct of atomic relation algebras A i (i &lt; !) over ! (in symbols, B = D A i , where D is some non-principal ultrafilter on !). By Los' theorem (see <ref> [2] </ref>, for example), B is also an atomic relation algebra. Let N be a finite, atomic B-network. <p> Let B j+1 be a countable, elementary subalgebra of B containing S and B j (existence follows from the downward Lowenheim-Skolem-Tarski theorem, or see <ref> [2] </ref>, theorem 3.1.6). This completes the construction of the chain. By construction, if 8 plays only atoms from B j , then 9 can win the play while only choosing atomic B j+1 -networks. <p> Now let A 0 be the union of the chain: A 0 = S j&lt;! B j . Then A 0 is an elementary extension of each B j (elementary chain theorem, <ref> [2] </ref> theorem 3.1.13), and hence is elementarily equivalent to B and A. Furthermore, it is clear that 9 has a winning strategy for the game G ! (;; A 0 ).

Reference-contexts: This completes the proof that N fl is a representation of A. 2 REMARK 11 A nearly identical result (lemma 5.15) was proved by Maddux [13]. The lemma also illustrates the relation between networks and the `bounded morphisms' of Goldblatt <ref> [3] </ref>. Let N be a non-empty atomic A-network. Let B be the proper relation algebra whose elements are all of the possible binary relations on N (i.e., the universe of B is P (N fi N )). <p> The atoms of B are essentially edges of N , so we can view N as a map : At (B) ! At (A). Then to say that N is a network simply says (in the notation of <ref> [3] </ref>, section 2.3) that N meets the universal (8) conditions of the definition of bounded morphism. And by lemma 10, an atomic network N yields a complete representation N fl if and only if N meets the universal-existential (89) conditions of `bounded morphism', too. <p> In fact, a bounded epimorphism : At (B) ! At (A) yields a complete representation of A even if A is not simple (cf. <ref> [3] </ref>, theorem 2.3.1); but we will not require that degree of sophistication here.

Reference-contexts: The proof uses ultrapowers and a combinatorial construction. The results are presented in a game-theoretic framework, and this is for a number of reasons. Firstly, the game-theoretic method has been used effectively to simplify and clarify quite difficult problems in the field <ref> [7] </ref>. This works largely because the goal of the second player is to build a representation, and it turns out that the algebra is representable if and only if the second fl Hirsch was supported by SERC grant reference GR/H46343. <p> variables v nm (n; m 2 S), having the following property: for any i, 9 has a winning strategy in G j (N + i ; B) if and only if B j= j (v nm =N + i (n; m) : n; m 2 S). (See section 3.5 and <ref> [7] </ref> for more on this.) Since 9 clearly has a winning strategy in G j (N + i ; B) for all j &lt; i, it follows that the type f j (v nm =N (n; m) : n; m 2 N ) : j &lt; !g; with free variables v <p> Hints of this can be seen in [10], especially p. 711 and the `graphical interpretation' on p. 712.

A satisfies the Lyndon conditions. 2. 9 has a winning strategy in the games G i (;; A) for all i &lt; !. 3.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction There are several types of representation for boolean algebras with operators, and of interest in this paper are the `ordinary' and `complete' representations <ref> [8, 10, 11, 17, 12, 13, 5, 1, 21, 19, 6] </ref>. <p> Complete representations have the additional property that they preserve arbitrary disjunctions (hence conjunctions too), wherever these are defined. Historically, there has been a certain confusion here, with complete and arbitrary representations at times being mistaken for each other (e.g., <ref> [10] </ref>). Representation classes | i.e., classes of all structures of the appropriate type that possess a representation | form varieties in almost every case in algebraic logic. <p> As an aside, the existence of a winning strategy for the existential player in all finite-length games over a relation algebra A is a property of A that turns out to be expressible by a first-order theory, equivalent to the Lyndon conditions of <ref> [10] </ref>. It is now a short step to prove (theorem 20) that an atomic relation algebra satisfies the Lyndon conditions if and only if it is elementarily equivalent to a completely representable relation algebra. In the light of [11], this is perhaps of interest in its own right. <p> We simply wish to point out a connection between the games (above) and some well-known work of Lyndon in the 1950s. This allows us to extend proposition 15. In <ref> [10] </ref>, x5, Lyndon gave an infinite (recursive) set C of first-order sentences in the language of relation algebras, which we will call the Lyndon conditions. They are related to the `n-dimensional bases' of [12]. <p> There is a close association between the Lyndon conditions on an atomic relation algebra A, and the existence of a winning strategy for 9 in the games G i (;; A) for i &lt; !. Hints of this can be seen in <ref> [10] </ref>, especially p. 711 and the `graphical interpretation' on p. 712. See also [7]. Formally, we have (1 , 2) of the following theorem. THEOREM 20 Let A be any atomic relation algebra. The following are equivalent. 1. <p> fg i : i &lt; !g Yellow = fyg Black = fbg White = fwg [ fw ij : i; j &lt; !g: The composition of an atomic relation algebra is defined by listing all triples of atoms (x; y; z) such that x; y z ^ (compare x4 of <ref> [10] </ref>). We shall call such triples consistent triples. If (x; y; z) is a consistent triple, then so are (y; z; x) and (z; x; y) and, since a symmetric relation algebra is commutative, the triples (x; z; y); (z; y; z), and (y; z; x) must also be consistent.

In outline, the argument for finite dimensional cylindric algebras is similar to the one for relation algebra.

Although Lyndon only defined the conditions in the context of simple atomic relation algebras, they make sense in any atomic relation algebra. He proved that a finite (simple) relation algebra satisfies the conditions if and only if it is representable.
