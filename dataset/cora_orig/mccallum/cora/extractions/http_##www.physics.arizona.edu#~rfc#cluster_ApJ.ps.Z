Reference-contexts: The Physical Setup In the absence of any outflow, many of Sgr A*'s radiative characteristics should be due to the deposition of the energy in the Galactic center wind into the central well. In the classical Bondi-Hoyle (BH) scenario <ref> (Bondi & Hoyle 1944) </ref>, the mass accretion rate for a uniform hypersonic flow past a centralized mass is _ M BH = R A where R A 2GM=v w 2 is the accretion radius and M is the gravitating mass.

Reference-contexts: Still, VLBA images of Sgr A* with milliarcsecond resolution <ref> (Bower & Backer 1998) </ref> show that at 7 mm, its size is 0:76 0:04 mas, or roughly 6:2 fi 10 13 cm, much smaller than the present limiting region within which the 2 3 fi 10 6 M fi are contained. <p> This occurs when strong shocks pass through this region; the shocks compress the field sufficiently to the point where it reaches, or even surpasses, equipartition and dissipation ensues. The turbulent, time-dependent nature of the flow is clearly evident in this Figure too. VLBA imaging of Sgr A* <ref> (Bower & Backer 1998) </ref> restricts its size at 7 mm to 0:76 0:04 mas, corresponding to a linear dimension of 6:2 fi 10 13 cm. The smallest cell size in our simulation is 7 fi 10 14 cm.

Reference-contexts: It should also be noted that the gas distribution in a multiple-wind source environment like that modeled here is distinctly different from that of a uniform flow past a central accretor <ref> (Coker & Melia 1997) </ref>. Unlike the latter, the former does not produce a large-scale bow shock, and therefore the environmental impact of the gravitational focusing by the central dark mass has significantly less order in this case.

Reference-contexts: In the future, we will use a more detailed treatment of this dissipation process based on the scheme described in Kowalenko & Melia (1997). The cooling function includes a multiple-Gaussian fit to the relevant cooling emissivities provided by N. Gehrels <ref> (see Gehrels & Williams 1993 and references cited therein) </ref>, though with the thermal bremsstrahlung portion supplanted with more accurate expressions that are valid over a broader range of - 11 - physical conditions and with the inclusion of magnetic bremsstrahlung.

These stellar motions seem to require a central dark mass of (2:61 0:35) fi 10 6 M fi (Genzel, et. al. 1997), in good agreement with both the ionized gas kinematics and the velocity dispersion measurements. <p> So for these calculations, we assume that the early-type stars enclosed (in projection) within the Western Arc, the Northern Arm, and the Bar produce the observed wind. Thus far, 25 such stars have been identified <ref> (Genzel, et al. 1996) </ref>, though the stellar wind characteristics of only 8 have been determined from their He I line emission (Najarro, et al. 1997; see Table 1).

Reference-contexts: So the dark matter may be distributed, perhaps in the form of white dwarfs, neutron stars, or ~ 10 M fi black holes <ref> (e.g., Haller et al. 1996) </ref>. However, the latest stellar kinematic results appear to rule out the first two possible constituents. <p> The same holds true for a population of white dwarfs. Moreover, the neutron stars would presumably have been formed with a substantial "kick" and would likely not remain bound to the nucleus <ref> (e.g., Haller, et al. 1996) </ref>. Thus, as long as the dark matter distribution is in equilibrium, and we ignore the dynamical effects of core collapse, the only viable alternative to the massive black hole paradigm may be a distributed population of ~ 10 M fi black holes.

Reference-contexts: Although these objects will have formed over a Hubble time within a much larger volume, some cluster evolution calculations <ref> (Lee 1995) </ref> have demonstrated that due to the large mass ratio of the stellar black holes to that of the normal stars, a core collapse could have driven the central component of the former to very high densities.

Reference-contexts: We show the predicted spectrum for this simulation in Figure 10. Not surprisingly, the spectrum has characteristics very reminiscent of a hot gas trapped in a shallow gravitational potential <ref> (e.g., Limaneto, et al. 1997) </ref>. That is, it is an accumulation of bremsstrahlung components with a high-energy shoulder characteristic of the highest temperature T max attained by the gas. As such, the radio luminosity is more than 4 orders of magnitude below that actually observed from Sgr A*.

Reference-contexts: Whatever the composition of a distributed mass concentration is, one would then be left with the task of accounting for the nature of Sgr A* itself, without the benefit of invoking the deep gravitational potential well of a point-like object <ref> (Melia 1994) </ref>. In this paper, we study in detail the emission characteristics that would be exhibited by a hot, magnetized plasma "trapped" within the dark cluster potential. <p> In principle, the gas can therefore attain the temperature (' 5 fi 10 9 K) required to produce the observed GHz (thermal) synchrotron radiation from Sgr A* if ' 6 <ref> (see Melia 1994) </ref>. <p> Zone sizes are geometrically - 10 - scaled by a factor of 1.02 so that the central zones are ~ 20 times smaller than the outermost zones, mimicking the "multiply nested grids" arrangement used by other researchers <ref> (e.g., Ruffert & Melia 1994) </ref>. This allows for maximal resolution of the central region (within the computer memory limits available) while sufficiently resolving the wind sources and minimizing zone-to-zone boundary effects. <p> Heating and Cooling Although we are modeling the wind sources more realistically than in previous work, we here ignore the effects of the magnetic field on the large scale kinematics. We take the medium to be an adiabatic polytropic gas, with fl = 5=3. Building on previous work <ref> (Melia 1994 and Coker & Melia 1997) </ref>, we have included a first order approximation to magnetic dissipative heating as well as an accurate expression for the cooling due to magnetic bremsstrahlung, thermal bremsstrahlung, line emission, radiative recombination, and 2 photon continuum emission for a gas with cosmic abundance. <p> For the former, we use (Rybicki & Lightman 1979) * T B = 2:84 fi 10 27 n 2 with a Gaunt factor of 1.2 and a Z of 1.3 (Rybicki & Lightman 1979), while for the latter <ref> (Melia 1994) </ref> * MB = 1:06 fi 10 15 G (T )n e B 2 erg s 1 cm 3 ; (14) where n e is the electron number density, T is the temperature, B is the magnetic field, and G (T ) is an analytical approximation to Equation (27) in <p> In contrast, the central density for a gas falling freely into a black hole potential with the same central mass approaches ~ 10 13 cm 3 <ref> (Melia 1994) </ref>. The temperature similarly rises to the middle (solid curve), but it levels off within about 0:004 pc, and the average is never greater than about 10 7 K. <p> The flattening of the density and temperature profiles shown in Figure 9 is a direct consequence of the shallowness of the cluster potential compared to the steep potential gradients encountered by the gas falling into the black hole <ref> (e.g., Melia 1994) </ref>. The magnetic field, which is coupled to the physical state of the gas, behaves in a similar fashion, though it is clumpier due to the uneven dissipation in regions of gas compression and rarefaction. We show the predicted spectrum for this simulation in Figure 10.
