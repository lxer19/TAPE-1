Abstract: We investigate the problem of reasoning with imprecise quantitative information. We give formal semantics to a notion of approximate observations, and define two types of entailment for a knowledge base with imprecise information: a cautious notion, which allows only completely justified conclusions, and a bold one, which allows jumping to conclusions. Both versions of the entailment relation are shown to be decidable. We investigate the behavior of the two alternatives on various examples, and show that the answers obtained are intuitively desirable. The behavior of these two entailment relations is completely characterized for a certain sublanguage, in terms of the logic of true equality. We demonstrate various properties of the full logic, and show how it applies to many situations of interest.

Reference-contexts: One might ask why we should bother designing a new logic, rather than using say, a variant of relevance logic <ref> [AB75] </ref>, fuzzy logic [Zad75], or any one of a number of nonmonotonic logics. Each of these logics has some properties that we view as desirable in our setting. The use of relevance logic would block the deduction of arbitrary formulas from an inconsistent knowledge base.

Reference-contexts: Tarski [Tar51] showed that the theory of real closed fields coincides with the theory of the reals (under formulas containing only +; fi; &lt;; = and constants 0; 1; 1). He also proved that the theory is decidable. Ben-Or, Kozen, and Reif <ref> [BKR86] </ref> extended this result to show that the complexity of the decision problem is exponential space. When defining L , we allowed a constant d r for every real number r. Clearly, we cannot extend the decision procedure to formulas containing such constants. <p> can in polynomial time construct formulas b and c over the vocabulary f0; 1; +; fi; &lt;g whose length 2 is linear in that of ' and KB, such that * KB j c ' iff hIR; 0; 1; +; fii j= c , From the results of [Tar51] and <ref> [BKR86] </ref> mentioned above, we immediately get: Corollary 4.3 : For KB, ' rational formulas, the problem of deciding whether KB j c ' (resp.

Reference-contexts: the form "90% of birds fly;" however, we do not wish to infer that the number of birds is divisible by 10, as we could if we interpret this statement as "precisely 90% of birds fly." It is more appropriate to interpret it as "approximately 90% of birds fly." (See <ref> [GHK92] </ref> for a thorough discussion.) Problems relating to the intransitivity of the perceptual indistinguishability relation in human observations [SKLT89] can also be formulated and circumvented using approximate equality (see Section 6.2). <p> The notion of exact inference could well be probabilistic or nonmonotonic. In particular, we can apply these ideas to *-semantics ([Pea88, GMP90]) and to the problem of computing degrees of belief from statistical information <ref> [GHK92] </ref> (see Section 6.3). 2 Syntax and Semantics Since we want to focus on the basic issues arising from the problem of approximate numerical information, we restrict ourselves to considering a relatively simple framework where these issues arise. <p> For example, we may know that different measurements were taken with the same measuring device, and therefore have the same maximum error. This issue was dealt with in <ref> [GHK92] </ref> by explicitly subscripting and so that each i denotes a different approximate equality relation. For the sake of simplicity, we have chosen not to extend the logic to express relationships between tolerances. <p> Our approach can be applied to any notion of inference rule, to convert a logic for reasoning about equality to one for reasoning about approximate equality. A final example of the generality of this framework uses yet another language and inference mechanism. In <ref> [GHK92] </ref>, we present a technique which deduces degrees of belief from a first-order knowledge base augmented with statistical information about the domain. <p> That is, given such a knowledge base KB and a formula ', we define the notion of the degree of belief in ' given KB, denoted Pr 1 ('jKB) (see <ref> [GHK92] </ref> for details). The statistical information has the form "the proportion of flyers among birds is 90%;" this type of information is usually based on some sort of statistical sampling, and is therefore only approximate. Moreover, as pointed out in [GHK92], if we were to interpret the statistical statement above as <p> belief in ' given KB, denoted Pr 1 ('jKB) (see <ref> [GHK92] </ref> for details). The statistical information has the form "the proportion of flyers among birds is 90%;" this type of information is usually based on some sort of statistical sampling, and is therefore only approximate. Moreover, as pointed out in [GHK92], if we were to interpret the statistical statement above as being precisely true, we would deduce that the number of birds is a multiple of 10, an inference which is surely undesirable. Therefore, approximate equality rather than precise equality is used in [GHK92]. <p> Moreover, as pointed out in <ref> [GHK92] </ref>, if we were to interpret the statistical statement above as being precisely true, we would deduce that the number of birds is a multiple of 10, an inference which is surely undesirable. Therefore, approximate equality rather than precise equality is used in [GHK92]. However, there is no analogue to (cautious or bold) entailment. Rather, the approach of [GHK92] can be viewed as using an analogue to validity (for an appropriate nonstandard notion of j=). <p> Therefore, approximate equality rather than precise equality is used in <ref> [GHK92] </ref>. However, there is no analogue to (cautious or bold) entailment. Rather, the approach of [GHK92] can be viewed as using an analogue to validity (for an appropriate nonstandard notion of j=). Since, as we have seen, very few interesting deductions regarding approximate inference can be made using validity, not much can be deduced if we have approximate equality in both ' and KB. <p> As an example of this phenomenon, suppose KB is "10% of birds are yellow, 20% of birds are green, and no birds are both yellow and green," and ' is "30% of birds are yellow or green." Using the approach of <ref> [GHK92] </ref>, we cannot deduce Pr 1 ('jKB) = 1. Moreover, this approach could not deal with inconsistent numerical information in KB.

Reference-contexts: Our formalism easily extends to encompass these proposals. Both proposals use the same basic idea: instead of looking at all probability distributions over worlds consistent with the constraints, one should look at one particular "special" one|the probability distribution satisfying the constraints that has maximum entropy (see <ref> [GMP90] </ref> for more details). This leads to nonmonotonic notions of inferences: we leap to the conclusions sanctioned by the distribution of maximum entropy consistent with our information, although they may not be sanctioned by other distributions consistent with our information.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, this is not quite Shoham's definition of preferential entailment. The exact analogue of Shoham's definition would have M j= ', not M j= '[t 0 ]. Page 9 Using the terminology of <ref> [KLM90] </ref>, what this dis-cussion has shown is that bold entailment is not closed under the And rule. We have also shown that neither bold nor cautious entailment is closed under the Reflexivity rule: it is not necessarily the case that KB j b KB or that KB j c KB. <p> Several examples have demonstrated that cautious entailment is nonmonotonic: adding information to the knowledge base can cause inferences to be lost. Interestingly, bold entailment is monotonic for a large fragment of the language. Both j b and j c are closed under most of the other rules suggested in <ref> [KLM90] </ref> (under certain restrictions such as strict independence). We discuss this issue in more detail in the full paper. 6 Applications 6.1 Error propagation So far, we have only looked at very simple examples, with two or three quantities of interest, and very few interactions between them.

Reference-contexts: Thus, they start from axioms, rather than models, as we do. When dealing with inexact measurement, the problems encountered typically involve intransitivities. Consider the following classic example <ref> [LR57] </ref>: Example 6.2: Let c n denote a standard cup of coffee that contains n granules of sugar. The agent cannot differentiate between c n and c n+1 by taste; therefore, its KB will contain c n c n+1 for every n.

Reference-contexts: An agent may frequently use probabilities to deal with its uncertainty about the truth of various sentences. For example, in <ref> [Nil86] </ref>, Nilsson suggests a framework for probabilistic logic, which, for the case of propositional logic, is essentially as follows. Consider a finite propositional language over the propositions p 1 ; : : :; p k .

Reference-contexts: However, since these logics were not designed specifically to Page 12 handle approximate measurement, none of them can capture all the situations in which we are interested. Threshold representations and semantics based on intervals can be used to directly express approximate quantities. In fact, Parikh's <ref> [Par83] </ref> theory of vague reals is a logical framework for doing this. However, as we explained in Section 6.2, approximate quantities differ from approximate measurements. Moreover, Parikh's framework requires observations to be given in terms of ranges rather than exact numbers; this is not always feasible.

Reference-contexts: The need for dealing with approximate information arises in many other contexts. We often want to say that a certain quantity (such as a probability) is very close to zero, without committing to a particular value. The technique of *-semantics <ref> [Pea88] </ref> is based on this concept (see Section 6.3). <p> This is, in fact, the effect of using approximate equality (instead of true equality) to represent the constraints, and using our framework for approximate entailment. The same framework for assigning probabilities to propositional sentences is also used in Pearl's *- semantics <ref> [Pea88] </ref>. The goal of *-semantics is to provide probabilistic semantics for default reasoning| defaults of the type "birds fly" are interpreted as meaning "almost all birds fly," and are given semantics using the conditional probability of the "fly" given "bird" (where "fly" and "bird" are propositions in the language). <p> Then, for any t such that t ((bird) 0) t ((fly^bird) (bird)), the assertion (fly^ bird) (bird) would be trivially true. This is not the case for the original assertion above. Page 11 the knowledge base to be inconsistent, allowing ar-bitrary deductions.

Reference-contexts: Our characterization also shows that, for a large subclass of formulas, cautious entailment reduces to a variant of preference semantics <ref> [Sho87] </ref> (see Section 5.2). While most of the paper focuses on issues concerning measurement, our approach is actually much more general. <p> Since we prefer to believe that the errors made were as small as possible, we can view the ordering &lt; on tolerance functions as defining a preference relation on tolerance functions, in the spirit of <ref> [Sho87] </ref>. Therefore, for the fragment of our language for which the characterization theorems (Theorems 5.5 and 5.16) hold, approximate entailment reduces to reasoning in the preferred models. Using these results, we can now show that for well-behaved formulas, cautious entailment is closely related to Shoham's notion of preferential entailment [Sho87]. <p> of <ref> [Sho87] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: But the intuition here is that, although we can work with any reasonable assumption about John's height, we do not want to work with contradictory assumptions simultaneously. Both types of entailment can be reduced to the validity of a formula in the language of real closed fields <ref> [Tar51] </ref>, and therefore are decidable.

To gain this insight, we consider several examples, and present general properties of our notion of approximate entailment.
