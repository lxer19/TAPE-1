Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive protocol for packet-level forward error-correction in dynamic networks. The objective is to facilitate best-effort real-time applications whose timing constraints rule out the use of retransmission-based ARQ schemes. The degree of redundancy is adjusted as a function of network state, decreasing when the network is well-behaved and increasing when it is not. The control problem is nontrivial due to the fact that increased redundancy, beyond a certain level, backfires resulting in self-induced congestion which impedes the timely recovery of information at the receiver. In the first part of the paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the control problem associated with dynamic forward error-correction, concentrating on a particular protocol called Adaptive Forward Error-Correction (AFEC). We show that instabilities can arise from two distinct sources|desired operating point location and network delay|and we give solutions to handle them. The first causal factor is intimately tied to optimality, making its achievement potentially perilous in the context of QoS-greedy applications. The second part of the paper presents simulation results that confirm the qualitative dynamics predicted by the analysis. We quantitatively estimate the redundancy-recovery rate function which relates redundancy to the quality of service rendered at the receiver. We show under what conditions the curve's shape is unimodal and to what degree. We compare the performance of AFEC against a static FEC protocol in which the redundancy factor is fixed. We show that AFEC exhibits superior performance when the network is subject to structural changes that persist for nonnegligible durations. Under short-range dependent traffic conditions, AFEC is able to closely match the performance of optimum static FEC but not exceed it.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Forward error-correction (FEC) is a well-studied reliable 1 communication technique which has been successfully used, primarily at the bit-level, in a number of application domains from space communication to reliable data storage on compact disks <ref> [1, 15, 16] </ref>. The idea of FEC is simple: given a communication channel with known error probabilities, use error-correcting codes to inject redundant information into the transmission such that a desired recovery rate|i.e., probability of successful decoding at the receiver of code blocks|is achieved.

Reference-contexts: Hence (1) may be rewritten as dh (t) = *(fl fl G (h (t t 0 ))) (3) where t 0 = t + ignoring the processing delay at the receiver. Equation (3) is a nonlinear autonomous delay differential equation 2 <ref> [9] </ref> and the study of its behavior is the subject matter at hand. Two forms of instability may arise, one from the value of the desired operating point (h fl ; fl fl ), and another stemming from the delay term t 0 in equation (3). <p> If t 0 is sufficiently large, then the oscillation can become unbounded leading to a different causal aspect of instability. We use a modified form of the Stable Manifold Theorem, adopted to the case of nonlinear autonomous delay differential equations <ref> [9] </ref>, to relate the stability of the nonlinear system to the stability property of the linearized system around a rest point. We assume sufficient smoothness and boundedness on G.

Reference-contexts: The more correlated the packet loss at a bottleneck link, the more packets in a contiguous packet train will be dropped, thus causing a dimished recovery rate at the receiver. It is well-known that bit-level FEC is ineffective for dependent-error channels <ref> [11] </ref> whose implications also hold for packet-level FEC. In packet-level FEC, queueing behavior at bottleneck buffers is an intrinsic component of the system capable of producing complex dependencies among nearby and not-so-nearby packets in a traffic stream. Packet loss constitutes just one aspect of this more general dependency-generating facility.

Reference-contexts: This paper has pursued an end-to-end approach to achieving adaptive redundancy control for packet-level forward error-correction. The time-redundancy schedule was set to uniform to combat the tendency of packet drops to occur in bursts. A further extension involves using space-redundancy scheduling in the form of dispersity routing <ref> [19] </ref> whereby decorrelation is achieved by choosing a set of disjoint or weakly correlated paths in the network. A drawback of this approach lies in the need to access routing functionalities thus deviating from the pure end-to-end solution taken thus far.

Reference-contexts: The bulk of the current work is directed at evaluating AFEC's performance under self-similar traffic conditions. We use a simulation set-up previously employed in the context of studying the causal and performance impact of long-range dependent traffic under various network conditions <ref> [22] </ref>. On the one hand, traffic self-similarity is bad news since bursts exist at multiple time scales and they do not dampen as traffic streams are multiplexed. On the other hand, long-range dependence suggests the presence of correlation structure which may be exploitable for adaptive forward error-correction purposes.

Assuming sufficient smoothness of G (mainly G 2 C 1 ), we can use the Stable Manifold Theorem <ref> [24] </ref> to relate the stability of the linearized system to that of the original nonlinear system in a local neighborhood of a rest point. That is, the (in)stability of the nonlinear system is implied by the (in)stability of the linearized system.
