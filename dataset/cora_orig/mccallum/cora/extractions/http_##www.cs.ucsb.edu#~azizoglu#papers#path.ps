Title: Isoperimetric Number of the Cartesian Product of Graphs and Paths  
Author: M. Cemil Azizoglu and Omer Egecioglu 
Keyword: Isoperimetric number, bisection width, path, array, Carte sian product graph.

Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of California at  
Abstract: We prove that the isoperimetric number of P k fi G k , the Cartesian product of the path P k and a connected graph with k vertices, is equal to the isoperimetric number of P k itself. At the same time we construct an infinite family of graphs that shows that this is not true for P k fi G where G has more than k vertices, even if G is a tree.
