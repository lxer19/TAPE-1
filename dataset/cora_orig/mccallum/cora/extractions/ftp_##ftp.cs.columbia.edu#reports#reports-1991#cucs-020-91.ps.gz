Abstract: Technical Report CUCS-020-91 Department of Computer Science Columbia University New York, NY 10027 Abstract Standard Functional Unification Grammars (FUGs) provide a structurally guided top-down control regime for text generation that is not appropriate for handling non-structural and dynamic constraints. We introduce two control tools that we have implemented for FUGs to address these limitations: bk-class, a tool to limit search by using a form of dependency-directed backtracking and external, a co-routine mechanism allowing a FUG to cooperate with dynamic constraint sources. We show how these tools complement the top-down regime of FUGs to enhance lexical choice.
