Abstract: The paper deals with on-line routing in WDM (wavelength division multiplexing) optical networks. A sequence of requests arrives over time, each is a pair of nodes to be connected by a path. The problem is to assign a wavelength and a path to each pair, so that no two paths sharing a link are assigned the same wavelength. The goal is to minimize the number of wavelengths used to establish all connections. We consider trees, trees of rings, and meshes topologies, previously studied in the off-line case. We give on-line algorithms with competitive ratio O(log n) for all these topologies. We give a matching (log n) lower bound for meshes. We also prove that any algorithm for trees cannot have competitive We also consider the problem where every edge is associated with parallel links. While in WDM technology, a fiber link requires different wavelengths for every transmission, SDM (space division multiplexing) technology allows parallel links for a single wavelength, at an additional cost. Thus, it may be beneficial in terms of network economics to combine between the two technologies (this is indeed done in practice). For arbitrary networks with (log n) parallel links we give an on-line algorithm with competitive ratio O(log n). y Dipartimento di Informatica e Sistemistica, Universita di Roma "La Sapienza".

Reference-contexts: The load version of this problem is where every requested pair must be assigned a path as to minimize the maximum number of paths crossing a given edge. Aspnes et al. <ref> [AAFPW93] </ref> give an O (log n) competitive algorithm for the load version. Most of the work has concentrated on the throughput version of the problem, where every requested pair may be either accepted or rejected. <p> We comment that this also provides the first lower bound for the load version of the virtual circuit routing problem in undirected networks with unit edge capacities, that can also be easily extended to bidirectional links, proving the optimality of the algorithm of <ref> [AAFPW93] </ref>. * We give an O (log n) competitive algorithm for path coloring on arbitrary networks with bandwidth (log n) (the actual statement is somewhat more general). This algorithm is also used as a building block for our algorithm for path coloring on meshes. <p> This algorithm is also used as a building block for our algorithm for path coloring on meshes. This result can be viewed as a balanced combination of WDM and SDM technologies. This result makes a stronger statement than the result of Aspens et. al. <ref> [AAFPW93] </ref> for the load version of the virtual circuit routing problem. * We give an O (log n) competitive algorithm for trees and trees of rings. <p> By applying Theorem 2 with fi = 1 and ff = 1 we get: Corollary 3 There exists an algorithm for on-line load balancing that uses O (fl fl ) colors with bandwidth O (log n). Note that Corollary 3 gives a stronger result than that of <ref> [AAFPW93] </ref> that shows that the on-line load is bounded by O (fl fl log n). Finally, going back to the path coloring problem. Recall that fl fl C fl B fl .

Reference-contexts: The basic problem, also referred to as call-control, is where the paths of all accepted pairs must be edge-disjoint. This can also be generalized to the case where edges may have a given bandwidth B (that can be viewed as having B parallel edges). Awerbuch, Azar and Plotkin <ref> [AAP93] </ref> prove that if B = (log n) then there is an O (log n) competitive algorithm (for throughput). They also give a lower bound of (n) for deterministic algorithms in the general case.

Reference-contexts: These results follow by showing that the path coloring problem on trees can be reduced to the problem of coloring a d-inductive graph, where d is at most twice the optimal solution. Irani <ref> [I90] </ref> shows how to color on-line any d-inductive graph with O (d log n) colors. We prove that any deterministic algorithm for trees cannot have competitive ratio better than ( log n log log n ) (even for trees with = O (log n)). <p> We obtain the O (log n) algorithm for trees by reducing the problem to the on-line coloring of a d-inductive graph. A graph is d-inductive if its vertices can be numbered in a way that each vertex has at most d links to vertices with higher number.
