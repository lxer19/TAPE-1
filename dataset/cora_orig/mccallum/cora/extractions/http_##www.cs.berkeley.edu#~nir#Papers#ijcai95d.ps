Abstract: In recent years, considerable effort has gone into understanding default reasoning. Most of this effort concentrated on the question of entailment, i.e., what conclusions are warranted by a knowledge-base of defaults. Surprisingly, few works formally examine the general role of defaults. We argue that an examination of this role is necessary in order to understand defaults, and suggest a concrete role for defaults: Defaults simplify our decision-making process, allowing us to make fast, approximately optimal decisions by ignoring certain possible states. In order to formalize this approach, we examine decision making in the framework of decision theory. We use probability and utility to measure the impact of possible states on the decision-making process. We accept a default if it ignores states with small impact according to our measure. We motivate our choice of measures and show that the resulting formalization of defaults satisfies desired properties of defaults, namely cumulative reasoning. Finally, we compare our approach with Poole's decision-theoretic defaults, and show how both can be combined to form an attractive framework for reasoning about decisions. We make numerous assumptions each day: the car will start, the road will not be blocked, there will be heavy traffic at 5pm, etc. Many of these assumptions are defeasible; we are willing to retract them given sufficient evidence. Humans naturally state defaults and draw conclusions from default information. Hence, defaults seem to play an important part in common-sense reasoning. To use such statements, however, we need a formal understanding of what defaults represent and what conclusions they admit. The problem of default entailment|roughly, what conclusions we should draw from a knowledge-base of defaults|has attracted a great deal of attention. Many researchers attempt to find "context-free" patterns of default reasoning (e.g., [ Kraus et al., 1990 ] ). As this research shows, much can be done in this approach. We claim, however, that the utility of this approach is limited; to gain a better understanding of defaults, we need to understand in what situations we should be willing to state a default. Our main thesis is that an investigation of defaults should elaborate their role in the behavior of the reasoning agent. This role should allow us to examine when a default is appropriate in terms of its implications on the agent's overall performance. In this paper, we suggest a particular role for defaults and show how this role allows us to provide a semantics for defaults. Of course, we do not claim that this is the only role defaults can play. In many applications, the end result of reasoning is a choice of actions. Usually, this choice is not optimal; there is too much uncertainty about the state of the world and the effects of actions to allow for an examination of all possibilities. We suggest that one role of defaults lies in simplifying our decision-making process by stating assumptions that reduce the space of examined possibilities. More precisely, we suggest that a default ' ! is a license to ignore : situations when our knowledge amounts to '. One particular suggestion that can be understood in this light is *-semantics [ Pearl, 1989 ] . In *-semantics, we accept a default ' ! if given the knowledge ', the probability of : is very small. This small probability of the :' states gives us a license to ignore them. Although probability plays an important part in our decisions, we claim that we should also examine the utility of our actions. For example, while most people think that it is highly unlikely that they will die next year, they also believe that they should not accept this as a default assumption in the context of a decision as to whether or not to buy life insurance. In this context, the stakes are too high to ignore this outcome, even though it is unlikely. We suggest that the license to ignore a set should be given based on its impact on our decision. To paraphrase this view, we should accept Bird ! Fly if assuming that the bird flies cannot get us into too much trouble. To formalize our intuitions we examine decision-making in the framework of decision theory [ Luce and Raiffa, 1957 ] . Decision theory represents a decision problem using several components: a set of possible states, a probability measure over these sets, and a utility function that assigns to each action and state a numerical value. fl To appear in IJCAI'95.

Reference-contexts: We believe that it is important to understand the normative foundations of such qualitative decision theory. This involves finding reasonable "rationality postulates" (in the sense of Savage's (1954) normative foundation for decision theory) that characterize these qualitative decision procedures. Initial results in this spirit appear in <ref> [ Brafman and Tennenholtz, 1994 ] </ref> , although in a somewhat different context. Such results should help us understand the consequences of adopting a specific representation for decision making under uncertainty. This type of investigation, which we are currently undertaking, should elucidate the tradeoffs between qualitative representations and quantitative representations.

Reference-contexts: Such an approach has been applied in the in *-semantics literature, and recent work [ Darwiche and Goldszmidt, 1994 ] indicate that such approximations might be quite useful. A possible avenue of future research is to use this method in knowledge-compilation of decision-theoretic information <ref> [ Henrion et al., 1991 ] </ref> . Roughly, in this method, off-line computation will generate a set of defaults using some parameter *. These defaults (and their logical consequences) will be used at run-time to ignore various possibilities, hence reducing the amount of time spent in evaluating possible actions.

Reference-contexts: Two properties of cumulative reasoning are especially important. The first is the AND property: AND. From ' ! 1 and ' ! 2 infer ' ! 1 ^ 2 . This property is derived from system C (see <ref> [ Kraus et al., 1990 ] </ref> ). This property deals with modularity of assumptions. It states that if we can safely assume 1 and also safely assume 2 , then we should be able to assume both. This property, however, is not guaranteed by Definition 2.1.

Reference-contexts: Decision-theoretic defaults can be viewed as summarizing the information encoded in the underlying decision-theoretic context and may allow for faster on-line computations. Our analysis is based on static or "one-shot" decision theory. Recently, there has been much work on decision making in dynamic environments (e.g., Markov Decision Processes <ref> [ Puterman, 1994 ] </ref> ).
