Abstract: Terminological reasoning is a mode of reasoning all hybrid knowledge representation systems based on KL-ONE rely on. After a short introduction of what terminological reasoning amounts to, it is proven that a complete inference algorithm for the BACK system would be computationally intractable. Interestingly, this result also applies to the KANDOR system, which had been conjectured to realize complete terminological inferences with a tractable algorithm. More generally, together with an earlier paper of Brachman and Levesque it shows that terminological reasoning is intractable for any system using a non-trivial description language. Finally, consequences of this distressing result are briefly discussed.

Reference-contexts: Therefore in practical systems tractable but incomplete algorithms are often used, as for example, in the terminological component of KL-TWO [9], in the reasoning maintenance system RUP [14], and in Allen's temporal reasoner <ref> [1] </ref>. 10 If, however, completeness is a goal one cannot dispense with, expressive power has to be severely restricted. In our case, one solution would be to sacrifice all operators that state relationships between roles, i.e., primitive subrole introduction and role-value-maps (another popular concept-forming operator).

Reference-contexts: of tractability for KANDOR by Patel-Schneider in [16, p. 16] does not hold, even not in the weak sense of [17, p. 345] 9 . 6 Consequences of this Result The proof of strong NP-hardness for FL N and similar FDLs, together with the result of Brachman and Levesque in <ref> [3] </ref> for FL, shows that any FDL with reasonable expressive power implies the intractability of complete subsumption. However, although this sounds rather disturbing, FDLs are undoubtedly a very useful class of knowledge representation formalisms.

A problem has pseudo-polynomial complexity if it can be solved in time polynomially proportional to the numbers appearing in the problem description. The well-known KNAPSACK problem, for instance, has this property.

Reference-contexts: Another view of this solution is that it provides a sound algorithm for standard semantics and gives a precise account|a model theoretic one| for where incompleteness with respect to standard semantics arises. This meets all the demands for a representation formalism McDermott spelled out in <ref> [15] </ref>. However, this solution has, because of the weak semantics, the disadvantage that a lot of inferences cannot be drawn even though they might be `obvious'.

Reference-contexts: From a pragmatic point of view it sometimes seems more worthwhile to choose the latter alternative, for example in natural language generation <ref> [20] </ref>, because even though we might miss an inference granted by the semantics|which seems not be very likely in the normal case|it would not result in a disaster. The same seems to be true for other applications as well.
