Abstract: This report studies rating systems: systems that produce quantitative measures, called "ratings," of the ability of players in a league, based on game results. By "quantitative", it is meant that win odds for a game between two players in the league may be estimated from their ratings. We consider both `static' and `dynamic' systems. The latter update the ratings after each game. Attention is given to noise in rating systems and to the distribution of ratings in the player population. Some real-world data is also included. This subject may be of interest to gamblers, gaming leagues, psychologists, consumer groups, and industry. Keywords | Game playing, learn

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The best way to introduce the reader to the idea of rating systems is to describe some actual rating systems. The most widely used rating system is the Elo system for rating chess players <ref> [elo78] </ref>. (A very similar system is used by the USTTA to rate ping-pong players.) Based on win/loss tournament results, the Elo system assigns "ratings" (numbers) to each player in the league; a player's rating is a quantitative measure of his chess ability. <p> This comment is surprising in view of the fact that we have shown that (EQ 24) which is isomorphic to the Zermelo model does yield consistent rating systems for 8 Arpad Elo's rating system <ref> [Elo78] </ref> used in chess is based on the Mosteller model. 9 Possibly something like the Mosteller model is relevant to a sport such as high-jumping, in which head-to-head competition is irrelevant and performance is easily measured against some absolute standard, but of course then assigning ratings is trivial and the function

Reference-contexts: The time development curve is x (t) = log (1 + c 7 t): (61) Interestingly, the distribution (EQ 60) exemplifies the "first type" of "extreme value distribution" cf. [Gumb54, 3.16]. Also, a well known observation from mortality tables ("Gompertz's law" <ref> [gomp25] </ref>) is that the distribution of human lifespans also has a doubly exponential falloff. 5.4 Learning model when "God is fallible" To model learning in games such as backgammon in which (see footnote 4) unbondedly large ratings are impossible, one may modify the learning model by replacing the "1" in the

Smith 3.6 Mosteller model There is one significant proposal in the literature of a linear rating system that does not obey the exponential tail property, namely the "Mosteller model" <ref> [most51] </ref> 8 . This model postulates that every player i has a "true strength" R i ; his "playing strength" varies from game to game according to independent selections from a normal distribution with mean R i and variance 1.

Reference-contexts: It may be found in <ref> [smit84] </ref>.) The result is Theorem 4 In the timesharing model, there is a unique perfect linear rating system, in which wp (x) = 2 [1 (2 jQxj 1)sign (Qx)] (20) where Q is a positive constant specifying choice of units. 3.2 The WM model We will now consider a slightly more <p> Again this functional equation has a unique solution subject to the assumptions of x2.5. (Again the easy proof is omitted and may be found in <ref> [smit84] </ref>.) The result is Theorem 5 In the WM model, there is a unique perfect linear rating system, in which wp (x) = 1 + exp (Qx) (Here Q is an arbitrary positive constant.) The relationship between a player's rating R and right move proba <br>- bility p in this system <p> The exponential tail property is then evident. 2 Another generalization of the WM model is called the "RL game." It was discussed in the appendix of <ref> [smit84] </ref>. The RL game is general enough to include the WM n model as a special case, but sophisticated enough to have rating triangles. 3.5 Zermelo model The "Zermelo model" [zerm26], which has also been called the "Bradley-Terry model" [brad76], has been rediscovered many times [ford57] [brad76] [jech83] [stob84]. <p> I have not used this data because the USCF's rating system does not follow the recommendations of the present paper nearly as closely as does the ICS rating system, cf. x8.2. A fit to 1978 USCF data was done in <ref> [smit84] </ref>, with the results that that rating distribution was fit considerably better by a learning model than by a normal or a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and again the doubly exponential falloff in the high tail was visible in the linear behavior of log (L=D). <p> Simply distribute R 1 R 0 rating points equally to the other players in the league each time this happens. (If a player turns out not to have really died, your error is correctable by undistributing the points.) 9 Acknowledgements This paper is based upon my Bachelor's thesis <ref> [smit84] </ref> which is available on microfilm from MIT libraries.

These include "bonus feedback points" that one gets when playing "underrated" opponents, and rating "floors" that prevent one's rating from dropping more than about 200 Elo below one's best ever rating.
