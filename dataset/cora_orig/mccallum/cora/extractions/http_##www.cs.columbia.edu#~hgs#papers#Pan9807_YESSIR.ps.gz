Title: YESSIR: A Simple Reservation Mechanism for the Internet all-or-nothing reservation model to support partial reservations
Author: Ping Pan and Henning Schulzrinne 
Note: YESSIR extends the  
Abstract: RSVP has been designed to support resource reservation in the Internet. However, it has two major problems: complexity and scalability. The former results in large message processing overhead at end systems and routers, and inefficient firewall processing at the edge of the network. The latter implies that in a backbone environment, the amount of bandwidth consumed by refresh messages and the storage space that is needed to support a large number of flows at a router are too large. We have developed a new reservation mechanism that simplifies the process of establishing reserved flows while preserving many unique features introduced by RSVP. Simplicity is measured in terms of control message processing, data packet processing, and user-level flexibility. Features such as robustness, advertising network service availability and resource sharing among multiple senders are also supported in the proposal. The proposed mechanism, YESSIR (YEt another Sender Session Internet Reservations) generates reservation requests by senders to reduce the processing overhead, builds on top of RTCP, uses soft state to maintain reservation states, supports shared reservation and associated flow merging and is compatible with the IETF Integrated Services models. To address the scalability issue, we investigate the possibility of using YESSIR for per-stream reservation and RSVP for aggregate reservation.

Reference-contexts: First, they need to parse and pass RSVP requests; they also need to correlate between the flows (session-sender pairs) described in RSVP messages and the actual data streams (Fig. 1). The reservation mechanism introduced here avoids these problems. D. RTP Features Useful for Resource Reservation RTP <ref> [1] </ref> has been designed to provide end-to-end delivery services for data with real-time characteristics. Although protocol-independent, applications normally run RTP on top of UDP to Fig. 1. RSVP overhead at a firewall make the use of its multiplexing and checksum services.

Reference-contexts: Both approaches can be combined; for example, a resource reservation protocol can limit the amount of traffic with a particular TOS value. We will focus primarily on per-flow resource reservation. Currently, RSVP <ref> [3] </ref>, [4] is the reservation protocol of record in the Internet. Unfortunately, its generality implies a cost in complexity, as discussed in Section I-C. We set out to address some of these issues. B.

Reference-contexts: This allows individual receivers within a single multicast group to request different levels of service guarantees, including none. It seems likely, however, that receivers will simply request whatever traffic bandwidth the sender has indicated, either through RSVP PATH messages or some other session initiation protocol <ref> [5] </ref>. The separation of reservation and path-finding messages for receiver-oriented reservation mechanisms imposes additional processing and protocol complexity. Receiver diversity: At least for bandwidth diversity, reservations are an inappropriate means to distinguish classes of receivers.

Reference-contexts: However, random packet dropping will quickly degrade most audio and video encodings due to their use of prediction across packet boundaries. Other mechanisms, such as layered multicast <ref> [6] </ref>, were found to be superior to support diverse receiver populations. RSVP receivers can request different values of queuing delay as part of their resource reservation.

Although RTP was not intended as a resource reservation protocol, resource reservation can benefit from the following RTP features: In-band signaling: RTP defines two types of packets: RTP for data transport and RTCP for control.

Reference-contexts: No kernel modifications, beyond the support of IP router alert options (Section I-E), are needed. E. IP Router Alert Option The IP router alert option <ref> [11] </ref>, [12] alerts transit routers to more closely examine the contents of an IP packet.

Reference-contexts: Note that RSVP could also be modified to have PATH messages initiate reservations, so that the benefits of sender orientation for some applications do not depend on the use of YESSIR. Robustness and soft-state: Similar to RSVP and PIM <ref> [13] </ref>, routers maintain reservation states as soft state, i.e., reservations disappear by themselves if not refreshed periodically. In YESSIR, this avoids orphan reservations and adapts quickly to routing changes. <p> Some of the unsolved issues are: Selecting RSVP proxy servers: In the example, the RSVP flow is originated from B1 and terminated at B3. The mechanism and criteria to select a proxy server can be tricky: a BGP external speaker [21], a PIM rendezvous point <ref> [13] </ref>, and a router managed by some policy agents are some of the candidates for RSVP proxy servers. RSVP tunnel identification: The combination of source and destination address and port number should not be used to classify packets inside the backbone due to large storage overhead.

Reference-contexts: The flow specification can be in several formats. The optional network monitoring fragment stores link resource information. If it is present in a request, every router along the path updates the link information in the fragment. Currently, we use the AD-SPEC format <ref> [16] </ref> defined by the IETF IntServ working group. Routers where reservation requests fail indicate the reason for failure in the optional reservation error fragment. The fragment is used to collect error information that will allow end systems and network administrators to diagnose reservation failure inside the network.

Network Resource Advertising In order to satisfy end-to-end service requirements, we adapted the OPWA (One-Pass With Advertising) scheme proposed by Shenker and Breslau [20] and described by Wro-clawski <ref> [16] </ref> for YESSIR. Here is how it works in the context of YESSIR: each reservation request message carries a network monitoring fragment that consists of fields for hop counts, propagation delay, aggregated bandwidth and delay bounds. As SR messages traverse routers, this fragment will be updated at every hop.

Reference-contexts: If a second packet for the same session comes along, the router computes the difference in time stamps and byte counts and thus computes an estimated rate. It then establishes reservations for this measured bandwidth, updated as new RTCP packets arrive. Compared to other measurement-based admission controls <ref> [17] </ref>, this frees the router from the burden to count packets and estimate rates. Another measurement method, which we have not explored in detail, simply has the end system mark an RTP data packet ev Fig. 4.

Separate ranges of the payload type values have been set aside for audio and video, so that a router can assign RTP flows at different granularity: by session, by payload type value or by media class.

Reference-contexts: Also, RTCP sender reports containing YESSIR reservation requests are always forwarded, even if unsuccessful. We chose this approach for several reasons: 1. This behavior is simple to implement. As shown in several RSVP implementations <ref> [19] </ref>, the support for error message handling and associated blockade states are costly in terms of protocol processing, timer management and extra state storage. 2. For links where resources are relatively plenty, such as a gi--gabit Ethernet, there is no reason to reserve resources for small data streams.

Reference-contexts: Senders can monitor receiver reports and only include a reservation request if a sufficiently large fraction of receivers indicate reception problems. I.

Reference-contexts: An end-to-end reserved connection is therefore established.

Reference-contexts: How to classify packets in backbone RSVP routers needs to be studied. Possible solutions could be encapsulating data packets at the edge of the backbone, or making the use of CIDR <ref> [22] </ref>, or managing IPv6 flow-ids properly. Join YESSIR/RSVP gateway: In the example above, senders S1 and S2 have to somehow join themselves to the nearest YESSIR/RSVP gateway, B1, prior to the reservation requesting time. The joining mechanism needs to be designed.
