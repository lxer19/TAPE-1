Abstract: In controller synthesis for basic robotic assembly tasks, the optimal performance is characterized by high level criteria. Performance of a peg-into-hole task is e.g. measured in insertion time and average/maximum force level. Moreover, the unknown optimal control of a peg-into-hole task was shown to be non-linear. Fuzzy rules are used in our approach to approximate this non-linear control. The fuzzy controller synthesis can be automated with the use of a machine learning tool SMART+ , provided that examples are available. Besides examples, SMART+ can also handle domain knowledge as input. Its output can also be a learning fuzzy controller, in order to achieve on-line performance improvement. The paper presents this approach and initial experiments. Keywords: machine learning, robotic assembly, fuzzy control, automated fuzzy controller synthesis.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and motivation This research has a double aim: to offer the robot programmer a new way to build a controller, and to explore programming and improvement of a basic robotic assembly operation with fuzzy control. The intensely studied peg-into-hole task has been selected for the experiments. According to <ref> [1] </ref>, the unknown optimal controller of a peg-into-hole task is non-linear. Fuzzy rules create a non-linear control surface based upon domain knowledge, and provide a formalism to represent uncertainty, a major problem in assembly.

Reference-contexts: of other command types, so that the best controller can be selected for each assembly phase. 4 Automated generation of a fuzzy controller Two are the basic approaches to FC automatic synthesis: an on-line approach, that aims at generating high-performance controllers by refining initial, usually handcrafted ones (see [12], [6], <ref> [2] </ref>), and an off-line approach, where controllers may be generated by using a domain theory [3, 4], or by induction from a set of examples [19]. Anyway, the two approaches should be seen as complementary. <p> A fuzzy controller can then be easily refined on-line, using a reinforcement learning technique. To this aim we are currently investigating the GARIC architecture proposed by Berenji <ref> [2] </ref>. 4.1 Controller Synthesis from Examples Manual design of a FC by a human expert is quite an expensive, time-consuming task. An alternative solution leading to a substantial cost reduction, is to induce it from examples of control actions.

Reference-contexts: So the problem of learning a continuous control function will be mapped onto the problem of learning #H classification theories. In the experiment described here, SMART+, an inductive system capable of inducing first order logic relations <ref> [5] </ref>, has been used to accomplish the inductive task. Induction follows a general to specific strategy similar to the one used by other systems (e.g. FOIL [16], FOCL [15]), and the search can be biased using a domain theory. As a particular case, a partial concept description can be suggested.

Reference-contexts: To achieve this frequency, the rules and fuzzification and defuzzification procedures were implemented as macros. This avoids the time wasted with parameter passing and stack operations due to function calls. 3.2 Experimental results The FC has been compared with the task frame controller described in <ref> [9] </ref>, measuring performance by insertion time and force level. Sensor traces of insertions with each controller are shown in figure 4. The better FC-based insertions are somewhat better than the task frame-based insertions. But also the FC experiences insertions with two-point contacts. <p> These robot traces were generated with the task frame contoller described in <ref> [9] </ref>. In our application, six output signals have to be generated, so with reference to what we have said, we had to generate six independent controllers sharing the input signals, only.

Reference-contexts: We chose to use trapezoidal membership functions, that are symmetrical for positive and negative linguistic variables. Rules similar to the Sugeno type [17] were used because of real-time constraints. These rules were observed to be as effective despite the fact that their fuzziness is limited to the antecedent part <ref> [10] </ref>, their consequent being a numerical value v i = f (X; Y : : :), if X, Y , : : : are input variables. 3.1 Hardware/software The experiments were performed on a KUKA-IR 361, equipped with a force sensor made at KULeuven/PMA.
