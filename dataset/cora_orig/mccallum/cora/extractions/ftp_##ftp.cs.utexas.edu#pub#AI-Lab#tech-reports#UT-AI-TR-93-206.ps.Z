Reference-contexts: Proper use of the mobility strategy can force an opponent to make a bad move because it is the only available move. All tournament players employ this strategy to some degree. The mobility strategy has been shown to be much harder to learn than the positional strategy <ref> (Billman and Shaman 1990) </ref>. Unlike many good ideas that are often discovered independently by several people, it is widely believed that the mobility strategy was discovered only once in Japan and has since been introduced to America and Europe through American players in contact with Japanese groups (Billman and Shaman 1990). <p> the positional strategy <ref> (Billman and Shaman 1990) </ref>. Unlike many good ideas that are often discovered independently by several people, it is widely believed that the mobility strategy was discovered only once in Japan and has since been introduced to America and Europe through American players in contact with Japanese groups (Billman and Shaman 1990). Being able to independently discover the mobility strategy through artificial evolution would therefore be a significant demonstration of the potential power of the evolutionary approach. 3 Implementation 3.1 Game-playing Neural Networks Our approach was to evolve a population of neural networks in the game of Othello.

Reference-contexts: whether connection is from/to an input/output unit or from another hidden unit. &lt; label i &gt; Label of the unit where connection is to be made. &lt; w i &gt; Weight of connection. &lt; end &gt; End marker. markers that indicate the start and the end of a protein definition <ref> (Griffiths et al. 1993) </ref>. Artificial genes can similarly use markers to define separate nodes in a neural network. Each node definition contains a start integer and an end integer. The integers in-between specify the node. Figure 2 shows the node definition in the marker-based scheme.

Reference-contexts: The chromosome was simply the concatenation of the weights in the network. Similar fixed architecture encoding techniques have been shown to be effective in domains such as evolving communication (Werner and Dyer 1991), processing sonar sinals (Montana and Davis 1988), and trail-following <ref> (Jefferson et al. 1991) </ref>. 3.4 Evolution Populations of 50 creatures were evolved with a gene size of 5000 integers for the marker-based creatures and 5160 integers for the fixed architecture creatures. A two point crossover was employed to generate two offspring per mating.

Reference-contexts: Rosenbloom created one of the first Othello programs called Iago (Rosenbloom 1982). This program, which achieved master level play, was based on ff-fi search techniques with kill tables. Lee and Mahajan developed a successor to Iago named Bill <ref> (Lee and Mahajan 1990) </ref>. Bill was based on similar search techniques, but also implemented Bayesian learning and many look up tables to recognize common patterns.

Reference-contexts: It was introduced to America in the early 1980's and soon attained international popularity. It is enjoyed by novices and experts, for its rules are simple, but complex strategies must be mastered to play the game well. Rosenbloom created one of the first Othello programs called Iago <ref> (Rosenbloom 1982) </ref>. This program, which achieved master level play, was based on ff-fi search techniques with kill tables. Lee and Mahajan developed a successor to Iago named Bill (Lee and Mahajan 1990). <p> The networks were initially evolved against a random move maker and later against an ff-fi search program. The number of wins over six games played determined the fitness of each network. The ff-fi program was allowed to search three levels down and used a positional strategy similar to Iago's <ref> (Rosenbloom 1982) </ref>. Iago's heuristic also contained a complex mobility strategy, which was purposely left out to provide a weakness that the creatures could exploit. 4 Results Experiments on artificial evolution are computationally very expensive, and many different populations were evolved throughout this research.
