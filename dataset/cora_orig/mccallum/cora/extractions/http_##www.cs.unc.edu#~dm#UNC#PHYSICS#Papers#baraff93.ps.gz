Abstract: Eurographics '93 State of the Art Reports Barcelona, September 6-10, 1993 This paper surveys recent work on dynamic simulation of rigid bodies with non-interpenetration constraints. The problems of collision detection and contact force determination are discussed, along with both frictionless and frictional collision and contact. For the collision-detection problem, methods which deal with objects' motion as a single continuous function of time are compared and contrasted to discretization methods. For the problem of determining interaction forces between contacting objects, both penalty and constraint-based methods are considered. This is an electronic reprint.

Reference-contexts: The collision detection algorithm in Gilbert, Johnson, and Keerthi [18] is structured so that it can use information previously computed to obtain a faster running time, but this is not a main consideration of the algorithm. Recently, work by Baraff <ref> [2] </ref> and Lin and Canny [26][27] has 8 Eurographics '93 State of the Art Reports Non-penetrating Rigid Body Simulation focused on collision detection methods for dynamic simulation that efficiently reuse previously computed information. <p> However, Featherstone's heuristic requires that configurations of bodies be statically determinate; that is, the normal forces that prevent inter-penetration for the configuration must be unique. Later work in Baraff <ref> [2] </ref> extends this formulation to deal with contacting curved surfaces.

Reference-contexts: In particular, Lin and Canny describe a collision detection algorithm for convex polyhedra that takes roughly O (1) time to test a pair of polyhedra. Baraff <ref> [3] </ref> describes a coherence based bounding box test that detects overlap between n bounding boxes in roughly O (n) time over the course of a simulation. Methods for coherence-based collision detection among convex curved surfaces are also described. <p> Baraff <ref> [3] </ref> contains a simpler proof of this behavior of the penalty method, and some additional discussion on modifying the penalty method for the inequality constrained case. <p> In general, it is unclear how to deal correctly with simultaneous impacts with friction, in either two or three dimensions. The simulator described in Baraff <ref> [3] </ref> computes simultaneous frictional impulses for three-dimensional bodies, based on a modification of the model proposed by L otstedt. For frictionless systems, the model is equivalent to the model in Featherstone [14]. However, for systems with friction, the model does not always properly conserve energy for impacts [6,44]. <p> Baraff [4] shows that determining if a given configuration of objects with dynamic friction is inconsistent is NP-complete. Baraff <ref> [3] </ref> discusses L otstedt's modification (which avoids the NP-complete complexity issue by making inconsistency impossible) and proposes a reinterpretation of the correct behavior of inconsistent configurations. The reinterpretation leads to an algorithm which makes an arbitrary choice among several possible motion behaviors.

Reference-contexts: However, Featherstone's heuristic requires that configurations of bodies be statically determinate; that is, the normal forces that prevent inter-penetration for the configuration must be unique. Later work in Baraff [2] extends this formulation to deal with contacting curved surfaces. Baraff <ref> [4] </ref> discusses issues involved in the actual solution of equation (8) and presents simulations that solve equation (8) using quadratic programming and linear complementarity methods. 4.2 The Penalty Method A vast number of simulations [11][20][24] [33][35][36][41] [42][45] have employed the penalty to enforce non-interpenetration constraints. <p> L otstedt [30], realizing that indeterminacy and inconsistency present major difficulties for a simulation process, proposes a modification of the Coulomb friction law that eliminates both inconsistency and indeterminacy, and further causes the LCP to always be convex. Baraff <ref> [4] </ref> shows that determining if a given configuration of objects with dynamic friction is inconsistent is NP-complete. Baraff [3] discusses L otstedt's modification (which avoids the NP-complete complexity issue by making inconsistency impossible) and proposes a reinterpretation of the correct behavior of inconsistent configurations. <p> Baraff <ref> [4] </ref> shows that the solution set of friction forces is not necessarily connected. This suggests that solving for friction forces might require minimization of a nonconvex function. It is known that configurations with static friction can be indeterminate, but no inconsistent configurations have been found. <p> Baraff shows that all one-point configurations with static friction are consistent and speculates that all configurations with static friction are consistent. L otstedt [30]'s modification of the Coulomb friction model enables him to solve for static friction forces using quadratic programming. Baraff <ref> [4] </ref> proposes a solution method that uses an iterative technique combined with quadratic programming to solve for friction forces according to the standard Coulomb friction model.

Reference-contexts: Examples include Canny <ref> [8] </ref>, who describes an algorithm for determining the first collision between rigid polyhedral objects with constant angular velocity. Using the constant angular velocity assumption, Canny reduces the problem of determining the first instant of collision to the problem of finding roots of (relatively low order) polynomials.

For example, consider a cube dropped onto a level plane so that all four vertices of the bottom face of the cube strike the plane together. There are large computational savings to be gained by modeling the collisions as occurring simultaneously. Cremer <ref> [10] </ref> discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the simultaneous model of collisions. L otstedt [30] computes simultaneous frictional impulses in three dimensions by using a modification of the Coulomb friction law that causes impacts to dissipate as much energy as possible.

Reference-contexts: Proper use of previous information can result in very simple, yet efficient collision/contact determination algorithms. The earliest example of such an algorithm occurs in work by Cundall <ref> [11] </ref>. Cundall's work on dynamic simulation of polyhedral blocks uses a collision/contact determination algorithm that specifically exploits information obtained from the previous determination. However, Cundall's approach is somewhat more complicated than needed for dynamic simulation and is restricted to polyhedra.

Reference-contexts: Very recently, "interval analysis" has attracted considerable attention in the computer graphics community as a method to deal with collision detection problems. (The method used by Von Herzen, Barr, and Zatz can in fact be considered a special case of interval analysis methods.) Duff <ref> [12] </ref> describes a collision detection method using interval analysis that handles rigid-body motion of implicit curved surfaces, but with restrictions on the motion path. Snyder [39] and Snyder [40] use interval analysis to find the first time of collision between both parametric and implicit time-dependent curved surfaces.

Reference-contexts: All of the above work took place before the discovery of the importance of P and NP time-complexities. As a result, the computational complexity of computing multiple contact forces was not of concern in any of the above work. In work done subsequent to this discovery, Erdmann <ref> [13] </ref> discusses the problem of computing constraint forces without friction, and notes that the problem is simply solved by an exhaustive search method, requiring exponential time. The earliest description of a simulator using exact methods to calculate constraint forces (by quadratic programming) appears to be by L otstedt [29]. <p> We call the first possibility, nonexistence of solution, inconsistency. The second problem, nonuniqueness of motion behavior, is called indeterminacy. Configurations with one contact point that exhibit inconsistency and indeterminacy have been discussed by Erdmann <ref> [13] </ref>, L otstedt [28], and Mason and Wang [32]. L otstedt [30], realizing that indeterminacy and inconsistency present major difficulties for a simulation process, proposes a modification of the Coulomb friction law that eliminates both inconsistency and indeterminacy, and further causes the LCP to always be convex.

Reference-contexts: Although the method has a theoretically firm basis, in practice, it is not a very robust numerical method. The main problem is that as k grows, equation (10) can become very poorly conditioned and difficult to solve <ref> [15] </ref>. The main attraction of the method is that it a very simple way of turning a constrained problem into an unconstrained problem. The equality constrained particle/surface problem in section 2.1 can be converted to an unconstrained dynamics problem in a similar fashion.

Reference-contexts: Gilbert, Johnson, and Keerthi [18] describe an algorithm for computing the minimum distance between convex polyhedra with n vertices; the algorithm appears to have a running time somewhat larger than O (n) but smaller than O (n log n).

Reference-contexts: If the particle has a velocity toward the surface then a collision has occurred. Treating the objects as perfectly rigid, we introduce an impulsive force between the particle and the surface, that produces an immediate change in the particle's velocity. Without friction, such an impulse is computed very simply <ref> [19] </ref>, and there is little more to say about the problem. Frictional collisions however are much more complicated. Additionally, we must consider the case when objects are in contact, but are not colliding.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the analysis of a frictional collision involving a single contact point is complicated, although the actual computation is simple, for two-dimensional systems. However, Wang and Mason's results are difficult to extend to three dimensions, which can be seen by considering Keller <ref> [22] </ref>, which presents a differential description of the three-dimensional motion of bodies undergoing a collision with friction at a single contact point. The differential equations appear easy to solve numerically, but very difficult to treat analytically.

Recent work on rigid-body simulations with impulsive collision forces include L otstedt [30], Featherstone [14], Moore and Wilhelms <ref> [36] </ref>, Baraff [1], and Cremer [10]. 10 Eurographics '93 State of the Art Reports Non-penetrating Rigid Body Simulation constraint force F c (t), with magnitude (t) = N (t) &gt; 0 and direction rC (x (t)) acts to prevent the particle from accelerating downwards. (b) The external force F (t) accelerates <p> However, when the particle lies above the surface, no penalty force acts on the particle. No distinction need be made between a collision at a contact point and simple resting behavior at a contact point. Moore and Wilhems <ref> [36] </ref> describe a system in which constraint-based methods are used to compute impulsive constraint forces for collisions and penalty forces are used for resting contact. <p> Keller's analysis involves regarding the collision as occurring over an arbitrarily small time interval, and examining the limiting behavior of the system as the time interval is brought to zero. The animation system described by Moore and Wilhelms <ref> [36] </ref> computes constraint impulses directly for collisions involving a single contact point. Moore and Wilhelms use a simplified description of the Coulomb friction law to compute frictional impulses at a single contact point in three dimensions. Modeling simultaneous collisions is more complicated.

Reference-contexts: of the penalty method for simulation arises: since the penalty method does not exactly maintain constraints, but allows some deviation, how does the penalty method compare with the constraint-based method of exactly enforcing the non-interpenetration constraints? For the equality-constrained case where no constraints are allowed to break, Rubin and Ungar <ref> [38] </ref> show that as the penalty constant k is increased without limit, the trajectory of the particle converges to the exact solution obtained using constraint methods.

Reference-contexts: Since no closed-form solution exists for the time at which the the first intersection occurs, an iterative numerical method is used to determine this time. Their algorithm is based in part on previous work by Gilbert, Johnson, and Keerthi [18]. Von Herzen, Barr, and Zatz <ref> [43] </ref> describe an algorithm that determines the first collision between parametrically defined time-dependent curved surfaces. In this work, the motion of the bodies is not necessarily rigid (that is, the actual shape of the surfaces may vary over time). <p> Von Herzen, Barr and Zatz <ref> [43] </ref>, and Snyder [40] use their continuum methods to solve this problem by considering the properties of the numerical differential equation solver used to solve equation (1) (or its rigid-body equivalent).
