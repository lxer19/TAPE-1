Abstract: The relative performance of different data collection methods in the assessment of various traffic parameters is significant when the amount of data generated by a complete trace of a traffic interval is computationally overwhelming, and even capturing summary statistics for all traffic is impractical. This paper presents a study of the performance of various methods of sampling in answering questions related to wide area network traffic characterization. Using a packet trace from a network environment that aggregates traffic from a large number of sources, we simulate various sampling approaches, including time-driven and event-driven methods, with both random and deterministic selection patterns, at a variety of granularities. Using several metrics which indicate the similarity between two distributions, we then compare the sampled traces to the parent population. Our results revealed that the time-triggered techniques did not perform as well as the packet-triggered ones. Furthermore, the performance differences within each class (packet-based or time-based techniques) are small.

Advanced Network Services (ANS) now performs the network operations center (NOC) services for the T3 NSFNET backbone, and designed the ARTS (ANSnet Router Traffic Statistics) package [2], for traffic characterization. <p> To categorize IP packets entering the backbone based on information contained in packet headers, one RT processor within each NSS was dedicated to examining the header of every packet traversing this intra-NSS processor interconnection facility. This dedicated processor utilized the NNStat package <ref> [3] </ref> to build statistical objects based on the collected information. The design of the T3 backbone required significant modification to the statistics collection mechanism. The T3 network design o*oaded the packet forwarding process onto intelligent subsystems, consisting of Intel 960 processors with their own memory and firmware.

Reference-contexts: The principal sources of information for the T3 NSFNET backbone come from programs using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) <ref> [4] </ref> for simple interface statistics, and specialized software packages for more comprehensive traffic characterization based on traffic type and source/destination. For the T1 backbone, Merit used a modified version of the NNStat [3] package for traffic characterization.

Reference-contexts: A service provider might also want a relative cost measure, for example the product of l 1 with the sampling fraction, to account for the resource savings of sampling less often. All these metrics are still subject to the influence of the sample size. Fleiss <ref> [9] </ref> offers another alternative metric to measure the degree of similarity between two distributions which is free of the influence of the sample size: the (phi) coefficient.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the 2 statistic is sensitive to the size of the data set, making it difficult to compare samples of varying sizes. Therefore, it cannot quantify significant trends when varying the sampling fraction, one of our primary concerns. Goodman and Kruskal <ref> [10] </ref> note that although useful as a test for the significance of the association between two data sets, the 2 statistic, or any simple function of it (e.g., the significance level), cannot serve as a measure of degree of association between two sets.
