Reference-contexts: Then the Markov chain X 0 ; X 1 ; X 2 ; : : : is recurrent. When E [log A 1 ] &lt; 0, the chain is positive recurrent <ref> (Brandt, 1986) </ref>. On the other hand, if E [log A 1 ] &gt; 0, then the random walk P t i=1 log A i , and hence Q t i=1 A i , diverge to infinity w.p. 1.

Reference-contexts: This correspondence can be viewed as a special case of the Duality Principle <ref> (Diebolt and Robert, 1994) </ref>. Our main result shows that this connection between the chains can be extended. Before stating this result, we consider an example in which X is finite. Example 2.1. Suppose that Xj ~ Binomial (n; ) where n is known and 2 (0; 1).

Reference-contexts: The transition density for the ~ R-chain is given by ~ R (yjx) = y!(x + a) 3 where p = (b + 1)=(b + 2) and x; y 2 f0; 1; 2; :::g. This is a generalized negative binomial mass function <ref> (Feller, 1968, p.269) </ref>. Indeed, when a is a positive integer, it is the usual negative binomial mass function.

Reference-contexts: Now, since () is increasing, E [log (Z t+1 =B t+1 )] = 0 when a = 0 and is strictly positive when a 2 (k; 0). Another application of Proposition 1 yields the result. Most of the admissibility and domination results for negative binomial models concern estimators of <ref> (e.g. Hwang, 1982a, 1982b) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: not be positive recurrent. (Such a chain is either null recurrent or transient.) Thus, the R-chain is positive recurrent only when is proper and, similarly, the ~ R-chain is positive recurrent only when m is proper. (This makes sense from a decision-theoretic standpoint because unique proper Bayes estimators are admissible <ref> (Lehmann, 1983, p.263) </ref> and Eaton's (1992) results deal with the more challenging case 5 where is improper.) Since m is proper if and only if is proper, it follows that the R-chain is positive recurrent if and only if the ~ R-chain is positive recurrent.

Reference-contexts: When b = 0, this is a standard random walk with a mean-zero increment, and is therefore null recurrent. When b 2 (1; 0), the coefficient of W t is larger than 1, and W is transient <ref> (Meyn and Tweedie, 1993, p.221) </ref>. Thus, P-admissibility holds when b = 0; that is, when the prior is Lebesgue measure. Indeed, Eaton (1992, p.1157) shows that, under very minimal conditions, P-admissibility holds when Lebesgue measure is used as a prior for a translation parameter. We return to this example below. <p> In Section 3 we consider the case in which X has a gamma density with known shape parameter and an improper gamma prior is placed on the unknown scale. Here the ~ R-chain turns out to be a bilinear model <ref> (Meyn and Tweedie, 1993, p.30) </ref>, and recent results of Babillot, Bougerol and Elie (1997) can be used to establish recurrence, and hence P-admissibility. Section 4 studies the case of the NB (k; p) distribution (with k known) and an improper beta prior on the unknown success probability, p. <p> A recurrent Markov chain possesses a unique (up to constant multiples) invariant measure. When the invariant measure is finite, the chain is called positive <ref> (Meyn and Tweedie, 1993, Chapter 10) </ref>. <p> Suppose that the ~ R-chain is recurrent; that is, for any B 2 B + (X ) and any starting value 1 X E [I B (V n )] = 1 <ref> (Meyn and Tweedie, 1993, p.496) </ref>. <p> Thus, P-admissibility holds when a = 0. Proof. Consider the ~ R-chain. By noting that the random variable Z = Y =(x + b) has a density that is independent of x, we may write the ~ R-chain as a bilinear model <ref> (Meyn and Tweedie, 1993, p.30) </ref> V t+1 = (V t + b)Z t+1 (6) where Z 1 ; Z 2 ; Z 3 ; : : : is an iid sequence of random variables with density f Z (z) = (ff + a)(ff) (z + 1) 2ff+a for z 2 (0; <p> Then since B has positive Lebesgue measure if and only if B fl has positive Lebesgue measure, it follows that (6) and (7) are either both recurrent or both transient. The random walk (7) is recurrent if and only if log Z has mean zero <ref> (Meyn and Tweedie, 1993, p.247) </ref>. Feller (1971, p.50) shows that Z has the same distribution as B 1 1 where B is Beta (ff + a; ff), from which it follows that the moment generating function of log Z exists. <p> + a + b; 1 (1 )(1 )) mass function, and we have R (j) = (k + a)(k) (1 (1 )(1 )) k+a+b : By noting that the density of 1 (1 ) 1 is free of , we may write the R-chain as a nonlinear state space model <ref> (Meyn and Tweedie, 1993, p.29) </ref> W t+1 = Z t+1 + W t where Z 1 ; Z 2 ; Z 3 ; : : : is an iid sequence of random variables such that (k + a)Z 1 =k has an F (2k; 2 (k + a)) distribution.

Reference-contexts: Definition 1. The prior, -(), is called P-admissible if the generalized Bayes estimate of every bounded function of is almost--admissible <ref> (Stein, 1965) </ref> under squared error loss. Of course, the generalized Bayes estimate of g () under squared error loss is the posterior expectation ffi g (X) := fi Also, since has support fi, almost--admissibility implies admissibility as long as all finite valued risk functions are continuous (Berger, 1985, Section 8.8).
