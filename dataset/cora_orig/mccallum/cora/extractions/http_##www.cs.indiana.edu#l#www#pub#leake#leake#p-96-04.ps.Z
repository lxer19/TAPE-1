Abstract: The ability of case-based reasoning (CBR) systems to apply cases to novel situations depends on their case adaptation knowledge. However, endowing CBR systems with adequate adaptation knowledge has proven to be a very difficult task. This paper describes a hybrid method for performing case adaptation, using a combination of rule-based and case-based reasoning. It shows how this approach provides a framework for acquiring flexible adaptation knowledge from experiences with autonomous adaptation and suggests its potential as a basis for acquisition of adaptation knowledge from interactive user guidance. It also presents initial experimental results examining the benefits of the approach and comparing the relative contributions of case learning and adaptation learning to reasoning performance.

Reference-contexts: There is growing interest in alleviating case adaptation problems through interactive user adaptation (e.g., Bell, Kedar & Bareiss, 1994; Goel et al. 1991), including presenting the user with derivational traces <ref> (Goel et al., 1996) </ref>. However, because those systems do not capture the results of the user's adaptations for future use, DIAL contributes a new approach to acquiring adaptation knowledge. Conclusion We have described ongoing research on a method for facilitating the acquisition of case adaptation knowledge.

Reference-contexts: DIAL includes a schema-based story understander, a response plan retriever and instantia-tor, a simple evaluator for candidate response plans, and an adaptation component to adapt plans when problems are found. The system's case-based planning framework is based in a straightforward way on previous case-based planners such as CHEF <ref> (Hammond 1989) </ref>. Consequently, we will not discuss DIAL's planning process per se, but instead will focus entirely on the system's case adaptation and adaptation learning. <p> We also intend to study the tradeoff between adaptation effort and adaptation quality, and the effects of adaptation learning on the quality of solutions generated. Relationship to Other Approaches Some early case-based reasoning systems included components for learning adaptation knowledge. For example, CHEF <ref> (Hammond 1989) </ref> bases its adaptations on both a static library of domain-independent plan repair strategies and a library of special-purpose ingredient critics, which suggest steps that must be added to any recipe using particular ingredients (e.g., that shrimp should be shelled before being added to a recipe).

Reference-contexts: DIAL's rule-based case adaptation treats the case adaptation process as involving two parts: applying structural transformations (e.g., additions, substitutions, and deletions) and performing memory search to find the information needed to apply the transformations <ref> (Kass 1990) </ref>. Accordingly, two types of case adaptation knowledge are needed: abstract transformations and memory search strategies. A small set of transformations is sufficient to characterize a wide range of adaptations (Kolodner 1993), but much domain-specific reasoning may be required to find the information to apply those transformations.

Reference-contexts: In addition, DIAL can perform adaptations from scratch when necessary to augment its library of cases. DIAL's flexible approach to memory search is inspired by the memory search process of CYRUS <ref> (Kolodner 1984) </ref>, and also relates to Oehlmann's 1993 question-based approach to introspective reasoning for guiding adaptation. Our use of both case-based planning and case-based case adaptation provides advantages of both derivational (Veloso & Carbonell 1994) and standard transformational approaches to CBR.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Case adaptation plays a fundamental role in the flexibility of case-based reasoning systems. The ability of CBR systems to solve novel problems depends on retrieving relevant prior solutions and adapting them to fit new circumstances. Considerable domain knowledge may be needed to guide this adaptation process <ref> (e.g., Kolodner, 1993) </ref>, and the need for such knowledge in turn raises the difficult question of that knowledge should be acquired and applied. Most CBR systems depend on a static library of built-in adaptation rules that are applied by rule-based production systems. <p> Accordingly, two types of case adaptation knowledge are needed: abstract transformations and memory search strategies. A small set of transformations is sufficient to characterize a wide range of adaptations <ref> (Kolodner 1993) </ref>, but much domain-specific reasoning may be required to find the information to apply those transformations. Consequently, a key issue is learning how to find the needed domain-specific knowledge.

Reference-contexts: the information needed to apply the transformation. (E.g., when performing a substitution, the knowledge goal is to find an object that satisfies all the case's constraints on the object being replaced.) The knowledge goal is then passed to a planning component that uses introspective reasoning about possible memory search strategies <ref> (Leake 1994) </ref> to guide search for the needed information. If the needed information is found, the transformation is applied. If it is not found, the process continues with step 4, manual adaptation. 3.

Reference-contexts: The system improves its adaptation capabilities by case-based reasoning applied to the case adaptation process itself: a trace of the steps in solving an adaptation problem is saved to be reused when similar adaptation problems arise in the future <ref> (Leake 1995) </ref>. In this way, a CBR system doing adaptation can acquire specific adaptation knowledge by using "weak methods" for adaptation when no specific knowledge is available.

Reference-contexts: Another issue requiring study is how similarity assessment criteria should change as adaptations are learned <ref> (Leake, Kinley, & Wilson 1996) </ref>. Nevertheless, we believe that combining transformational CBR for planning with derivational CBR for performing adaptation is a promising approach.

Reference-contexts: Accounts of human disaster response planning suggest that case-based reasoning is important in response planning by human disaster planners <ref> (Rosenthal, Charles, & Hart 1989) </ref>. Our testbed system, DIAL, processes conceptual representations of a news story describing the initial events in a disaster, and proposes a response plan by retrieving and adapting the response plan for a similar prior disaster. <p> For CBR tasks such as disaster response planning, derivations of solutions are not generally available, and planning from scratch is not satisfactory because domain theories are inaccurate and intractable. However, examples of prior solutions are readily available in news stories and case-books used to train disaster response planners <ref> (e.g., Rosenthal et al., 1989) </ref>. This favors a transformational approach to reusing disaster response plans. However, derivational approaches can simplify the reapplication of a case to a new situation, and the rationale for the system's choice of particular steps during adaptation of prior cases is available.

Reference-contexts: Memory Search Plans: DIAL's memory search process starts from an input knowledge goal and uses a combination of rule-based and case-based reasoning to guide the traversal of memory to find the needed information.

Reference-contexts: CHEF uses special-purpose procedures to learn new ingredient critics. PERSUADER <ref> (Sycara 1988) </ref> uses a combination of adaptation heuristics and previously-stored adaptation episodes to suggest adaptations. In both these systems, learned adaptations can only be reused in very similar situations; the adaptation cases learned by DIAL can be reused more flexibly.

Our use of both case-based planning and case-based case adaptation provides advantages of both derivational <ref> (Veloso & Carbonell 1994) </ref> and standard transformational approaches to CBR. Transformational CBR approaches store and adapt a solution to a problem, while derivational approaches store and replay a derivational trace of the problem-solving steps used to generate a previous solution.
