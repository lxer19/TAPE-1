Reference-contexts: Such a proof guarantees a large probability that S is true. Equivalence between proofs in ARS and interactive proofs. Proofs in ARS look like interactive proofs (more exactly, like Arthur-Merlin proofs, <ref> [1, 3] </ref>) of a special kind. Indeed, given a formula S, Merlin (the prover) successively generates formulas that constitute a proof of S in ARS.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to show that a language with polynomially long proofs in ARS has an interactive proof system. The converse is more difficult to prove. Our proof is essentially based on the method proposed in [7] and used in <ref> [8, 2, 9] </ref> to prove IP = P SP ACE. 2 Section 2 Interactive proofs (the standard version) There are two standard versions of interactive proofs. A more general version was introduced by S.Goldwasser, S.Micali and C.Rackoff in [4], the term "interactive proofs" usually refers to their version. <p> C.Lund, L.Fortnow, H.Karloff and N.Nisan showed in [7] that this class contains the polynomial hierarchy P H. In [8] A.Shamir extended their method and proved IP = P SP ACE (other proofs based on the same techniques of [7] were proposed in <ref> [2] </ref> and [9]). This result completely characterizes the power of interactive proof systems. 4 Section 3 Arithmetic with random substitution In this section we extend arithmetic by adding a new rule of inference. By arithmetic we mean formal arithmetic (any traditional formalization is suitable for our purposes).

Reference-contexts: A more general version was introduced by S.Goldwasser, S.Micali and C.Rackoff in <ref> [4] </ref>, the term "interactive proofs" usually refers to their version. Independently, L.Babai defined "Arthur-Merlin proofs" which are in fact a special kind of interactive proof ([1, 3]). Although Babai's version looks much weaker, it turned out that both kinds of proof are equivalent ([5]).

Reference-contexts: Arthur- Merlin proofs are sometimes called interactive proofs with public coins to emphasize the fact that Merlin, unlike the prover in the general version, can see all results of flipping coins (although cannot know them in advance). S.Goldwasser and M.Sipser proved in <ref> [5] </ref> that if a language L has an interactive proof system then L has an Arthur-Merlin proof system. Moreover, L has an Arthur-Merlin proof system such that the number of steps remains the same ([3]). It shows the equivalence of both versions of interactive proofs.

Reference-contexts: The work <ref> [6] </ref> gives an upper bound on the length of such a proof in 7 arithmetic: if for any random sequence, a formula S has a proof in ARS not longer than l, then S has a proof in arithmetic not longer than 2 O (l) .

By arithmetic we mean formal arithmetic (any traditional formalization is suitable for our purposes). <p> Clearly, it suffices to show that QBF fl has polynomially long proofs in ARS. To construct such proofs, we take the known interactive proofs for true quantified Boolean formulas (namely, the variant proposed by A.Shen in <ref> [9] </ref>) and, in fact, "formalize" them in ARS. In other words, we find suitable arithmetizations ff * of QBF fl and show that Shen's interactive proofs for QBF fl can be translated into proofs for ff * (QBF fl ) in ARS (*).
