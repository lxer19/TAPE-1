Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of the following load balancing algorithm. At each step, each node in a network examines the number of tokens at each of its neighbors and sends a token to each neighbor with at least 2d + 1 fewer tokens, where d is the maximum degree of any node in the network. We show that within O(=ff) steps, the algorithm reduces the maximum difference in tokens between any two nodes to at most O((d 2 log n)=ff), where is the maximum difference between the number tokens at any node initially and the average number of tokens, n is the number of nodes in the network, and ff is the edge expansion of the network. The time bound is tight in the sense that for any graph with edge expansion ff, and for any value , there exists an initial distribution of tokens with imbalance for which the time to reduce the imbalance to even =2 is at least (=ff). The bound on the final imbalance is tight in the sense that there exists a class of networks that can be locally balanced everywhere (i.e., the maximum difference in tokens between any two neighbors is at most 2d), while the global imbalance remains ((d 2 log n)=ff). Furthermore, we show that upon reaching a state with a global imbalance of O((d 2 log n)=ff), the time for this algorithm to locally balance the network can be as large as (n 1=2 ). We extend our analysis to a variant of this algorithm for dynamic and asynchronous networks. We also present tight bounds for a randomized algorithm in which each node sends at most one token in each step.

Reference-contexts: In general, work on dynamic and asynchronous networks has been limited. In work related to load balancing for instance, an end-to-end communication problem, namely one in which messages are routed from a single source to a single destination, has been studied in <ref> [1, 7] </ref> on dynamic networks. Our scenario is substantially more involved since we are required to move load between several sources and destinations simultaneously. Another result on dynamic networks is the recent analysis of a local algorithm for the approximate multicommodity flow problem [5, 6]. <p> We denote the average number of tokens by . For simplicity, throughout this paper we assume that is an integer. We assign a unique rank from <ref> [1; w (v)] </ref> to every token at v. The height of a token is its rank minus . The height of a node is the maximum among the heights of all its tokens. <p> For any bad index i, we have jS &gt;i j &lt; jS i j=(1 + ff=(2d)). Since jS &gt;0 j=(1 + ff=(2d)) log (1+ff=(2d)) n 1, there can be at most dlog (1+ff=(2d)) ne bad indices. It follows that 4 at least half of the indices in <ref> [1; 2dlog (1+ff=(2d)) ne] </ref> are good. 3. Analysis for static synchronous networks 3.1. The single-port model In this section, we analyze the single-port load balancing algorithm that is described in Section 1.1. Theorem 3.1. <p> It holds that either jS &gt;0 j n=2 at the start of at least half the steps, or jS 0 j n=2 at the start of at least half the steps. Without loss of generality, assume the former is true. Since at least half of the indices in <ref> [1; 2dlog (1+ff=(2d)) ne] </ref> are good in any time step t, there exists an index j in [1; 2dlog (1+ff=(2d)) ne] that is good in at least half of those time steps in which jS &gt;0 j n=2. Hence j is good in at least T =4 steps. <p> Without loss of generality, assume the former is true. Since at least half of the indices in <ref> [1; 2dlog (1+ff=(2d)) ne] </ref> are good in any time step t, there exists an index j in [1; 2dlog (1+ff=(2d)) ne] that is good in at least half of those time steps in which jS &gt;0 j n=2. Hence j is good in at least T =4 steps. <p> Consider the first T steps of the algorithm with T to be specified later. Without loss of generality, we assume that jS &gt;0 j n=2 holds in at least half of these steps. By Section 2, there exists an index j in <ref> [1; 2dlog 1+ff=(2d) ne] </ref> that is good in at least half of those steps in which jS &gt;0 j n=2. Hence in T steps of the algorithm, j is good in at least T =4 steps. <p> Consider T steps of DS. We assume without loss of generality that jS &gt;0 j n=2 at the start of at least T =2 steps. There exists an index j in <ref> [1; d2 log 1+ff=(2d) ne] </ref> that is good in at least half the steps at the start of which jS &gt;0 j n=2. If index j is good at the start of step t, we call t a good step.

Reference-contexts: At each step, a token is sent from node u to node v across edge (u; v) if at the beginning of the step node u contained at least 2d + 1 more tokens than node v. This algorithm was first analyzed in <ref> [2] </ref>. As in the single-port case, we analyze the multi-port algorithm in terms of both edge expansion and node expansion. In terms of edge expansion, the algorithm balances to within O (d 2 log n=ff) tokens in O (=ff) steps. <p> A number of models have been proposed for load balancing, differing chiefly in the amount of global information used by the algorithm <ref> [2, 11, 12, 14, 26, 30] </ref>. On these models, algorithms have been proposed for specific applications; also, proposed heuristics and algorithms have been analyzed using simulations and queuing-theoretic techniques [27, 34, 36]. <p> The second model is the one that we adopt here, namely one in which at most one unit load can be moved across a link in each time step. Load balancing algorithms on the second model were first proposed and analyzed in <ref> [2] </ref> for the multi-port variant and in [14] for the single-port variant. The upper bounds established by them are suboptimal by a factor of ( p n) or (log (n)) in general. Our result here is an improved, in fact, an optimal bound for the same problem. <p> The upper bounds established by them are suboptimal by a factor of ( p n) or (log (n)) in general. Our result here is an improved, in fact, an optimal bound for the same problem. As remarked earlier, our multi-port results (and those in <ref> [2] </ref>) hold even for dynamic or asynchronous networks. In general, work on dynamic and asynchronous networks has been limited. <p> Second, our argument uses an exponential potential function. The analyses in [12, 20, 29], in contrast, use quadratic potential functions. Our potential function and our amortized analysis were necessary since a number of previous attempts using quadratic potential functions yielded suboptimal results <ref> [2, 14] </ref> for local load balancing. 1.3. Outline The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains some definitions. Section 3.1 analyzes the performance of the single-port algorithm. Section 3.2 analyzes the performance of the multi-port algorithm. <p> If &lt; (d 2 log n)=, the multi-port algorithm balances to within O ((d log n)=) tokens in O (=) steps. 4. Local load balancing can be expensive In this section, we show that locally load balancing to within 2d tokens using the multi-port algorithm of <ref> [2] </ref> described in Section 1.1 can take (n 1=2 ) more time than globally load balancing to within O ((d log n)=) tokens. <p> We first prove that a variant of the local multi-port algorithm is optimal on dynamic synchronous networks in the same sense as for static synchronous networks. We then use a result of <ref> [2] </ref> that relates the dynamic synchronous and asynchronous models, to extend our results to asynchronous networks. In the dynamic synchronous model, the edges of the network may fail or succeed dynamically. <p> We assume that at each step each node knows which of its adjacent edges are live. The local load balancing algorithm for static synchronous networks can be modified to work on dynamic synchronous networks. The algorithm presented here is essentially the same as in <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> A simple variant of DS, as suggested in <ref> [2] </ref>, can be defined for asynchronous networks. As shown in [2], the analysis for the dynamic synchronous case can be used for asynchronous networks to yield the same time bounds. <p> A simple variant of DS, as suggested in <ref> [2] </ref>, can be defined for asynchronous networks. As shown in [2], the analysis for the dynamic synchronous case can be used for asynchronous networks to yield the same time bounds. Hence, the multi-port local load balancing algorithm balances to within O (d 2 log n=ff) tokens in time O (=ff) on aynchronous networks. 6.

Reference-contexts: Peleg and Upfal [31] pioneered this study by identifying certain small-degree expanders as being suitable for load balancing. Their work has been extended in [9, 17, 32].

Thus, they do not work on networks of arbitrary topology. Also, these algorithms work by setting up fixed paths through the network on which load is moved and therefore fail when the network changes.

Reference-contexts: For each edge (u; v) in M , if u and v have the same number of tokens, then nothing is sent across (u; v).

We analyze the performance of the single-port algorithm in terms of both the edge expansion and the node expansion of the graph. In terms of edge expansion, we show that the single-port algorithm balances to within O (d log n=ff) tokens in O (d=ff) steps, with high probability. <p> A number of models have been proposed for load balancing, differing chiefly in the amount of global information used by the algorithm <ref> [2, 11, 12, 14, 26, 30] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In what follows, we focus on models that allow only local algorithms and on prior work that takes an analytical approach to the load balancing problem. Local algorithms restricted to particular networks have been studied on counting networks <ref> [4, 22] </ref>, hypercubes [19, 33], and meshes [16, 28].

Reference-contexts: We also study the off-line load balancing problem, in which every node has knowledge of the global state of the network. This problem on has been studied on static synchronous networks in <ref> [28] </ref>. We use their results to obtain tight bounds on off-line load balancing in terms of edge expansion and node expansion. In particular, we prove that any network can be balanced off-line in d (1 + )=e steps such that no node has more than two tokens over the average. <p> In what follows, we focus on models that allow only local algorithms and on prior work that takes an analytical approach to the load balancing problem.

Peleg and Upfal [31] pioneered this study by identifying certain small-degree expanders as being suitable for load balancing. Their work has been extended in [9, 17, 32]. <p> For the second part of the lemma, consider set Y of size at most jV j=2 such that A (Y ) = jY j. If we set X = Y [ A (Y ), then m (X) A (Y ) = jXj=(1 + ). Theorem 1 of <ref> [28] </ref> obtains tight bounds on the o*ine complexity of load balancing in terms of the function m. By invoking Lemma 6.1, we obtain Lemma 6.2 ([28]). <p> Moreover, there exists a network G and an initial load distribution with imbalance such that any algorithm takes at least d (1 + )=e steps to balance G such that every node has at most de tokens. By using the techniques of <ref> [28] </ref>, we can modify the proof of Lemma 6.2 to show that any network G with node expansion and initial imbalance can be globally balanced to within 3 tokens in at most 2d (1+)=e steps. Lemma 6.2 implies that our local single-port algorithm is not optimal for all networks. <p> For all X V , we have (i) jI (X) jXjj minfjXj; jXjg and (ii) jM (X; X)j ff minfjXj; jXjg. It follows from (i) and (ii) that T d=ffe. We essentially modify the proofs of Theorem 1 and Lemma 4 of <ref> [28] </ref> (where the single-port model was assumed) to establish the desired claims for the multi-port model. We transform the load balancing problem on G to a network flow problem on a directed graph H = (V 0 ; E 0 ) which is constructed as follows.

Reference-contexts: Indeed the convergence bounds in both cases depend on the expansion properties of the underlying graph and they are established using potential function arguments. There are however two important differences. First, the analysis of the rapid convergence of random walks <ref> [20, 29] </ref> relies on averaging arbitrary probabilities across any edge. This corresponds to sending an arbitrary (possibly nonintegral) load along an edge which is forbidden in our model. In this sense, the analysis in [12] (and all references in the unbounded capacity model) are similar to the random walk analysis. <p> In this sense, the analysis in [12] (and all references in the unbounded capacity model) are similar to the random walk analysis. Second, our argument uses an exponential potential function. The analyses in <ref> [12, 20, 29] </ref>, in contrast, use quadratic potential functions. Our potential function and our amortized analysis were necessary since a number of previous attempts using quadratic potential functions yielded suboptimal results [2, 14] for local load balancing. 1.3. Outline The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, our local algorithm works on any arbitrary dynamic network that remains connected. On arbitrary topologies, load balancing has been studied under two models. In the first model, any amount of load can be moved across a link in any time step <ref> [8, 12, 14, 18, 35] </ref>. The second model is the one that we adopt here, namely one in which at most one unit load can be moved across a link in each time step.
