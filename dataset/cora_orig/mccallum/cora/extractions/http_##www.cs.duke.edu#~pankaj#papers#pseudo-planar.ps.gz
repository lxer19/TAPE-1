Reference-contexts: Using our main result, we also improve these bounds to O (n log 2k6 n), as shown in Section 3. A linear upper bound was proved by Capoyleas and Pach <ref> [1] </ref> for a special case of this problem. Many other related problems and results can be found in the book by Pach and Agarwal [6]. Theorem 1.1 If G (V; E) is a quasi-planar graph, then jEj = O (jV j).

Reference-contexts: In the sequel, we use the following notion. A graph is called an overlap graph if its vertices can be represented by intervals on a line so that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding intervals overlap but neither of them contains the other <ref> [2] </ref>. Gyarfas [3] (see also [4]) has shown that every triangle-free overlap graph can be colored by a constant number, c, of colors, and Kostochka [5] proved that this is true with c = 5.

Moreover, if there exists such a drawing of G in which the vertices lie on two parallel lines, then one can easily show that (G) 2.

Reference-contexts: The aim of this paper is to establish an O (n) upper bound on the number of edges in any quasi-planar graph with n vertices. This improves an earlier result of Pach et al. <ref> [7] </ref>, who had shown that a quasi-planar graph with n vertices has O (n log 2 n) edges. <p> This is a special case of a more general result, in which one assumes that G can be drawn in the plane with no k pairwise crossing edges, for some constant k 3. It is shown in <ref> [7] </ref> that in this case the number of edges of G is O (n log 2k4 n). Using our main result, we also improve these bounds to O (n log 2k6 n), as shown in Section 3. <p> Then G e is a quasi-planar graph. Thus, by Theorem 1.1, the number of edges of G e is O (n), which implies that C = O (njEj). One can then combine this estimate with the analysis in <ref> [7] </ref>, to conclude that jEj = O (n log 2 n). 2 Corollary 3.2 Let k 4 be an integer, and let G be a graph with n vertices that can be drawn in the plane with no k pairwise crossing edges. <p> Then the number of edges of G is O (n log 2k6 n). Proof: This is an immediate consequence of the analysis in <ref> [7] </ref>, which proceeds by induction on k, based on the improved bound of Theorem 3.1 for k = 4. 2 Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.2 improve the bounds given in [7] by a factor of fi (log 2 n). <p> Proof: This is an immediate consequence of the analysis in <ref> [7] </ref>, which proceeds by induction on k, based on the improved bound of Theorem 3.1 for k = 4. 2 Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.2 improve the bounds given in [7] by a factor of fi (log 2 n). There are several interesting problems that are left open in this paper. The first problem is to find the best constant of proportionality in the bound of Theorem 1.1.
