Abstract: Visualization of musical information provides help and support for many musical analysis activities. This paper presents a system where standard music notation is augmented by multiple cue information display, using 3D visualization of spatially positioned auditory stimuli. Virtual reality systems are visualization media for interpreting interactive dynamic simulations of physical systems. We propose a mapping that provides a visualization system whose goal is to improve the visual and auditory information available for music analysis. The various parts of our system span different research domains: music cognition, visual perception and data visualization; in this paper, we focus mainly on visualization issues.

Reference-contexts: Potential uses of this system include music analysis, computer music composition, and music education. The final target platform for the system is the CAVE, a VR environment developed by the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois in Chicago <ref> [1] </ref>. Standard musical notation is the only indisputable standard way to visually represent the vast majority of music material. It can be enhanced in two ways: augmenting the number of ways information is displayed (multiple cues) and augmenting the amount of displayed information (adding extra visualization paradigms).

Reference-contexts: Musical Education exploiting Musical Intelligence Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences <ref> [2] </ref> provides a theoretical foundation for recognizing abilities in such different areas as music, spatial relations and bodily control. It is mainly a psychological theory not a direct educational strategy but understanding its principles should allow a wider range of students to successfully profit from classroom learning.

Reference-contexts: In tonal music Form Analysis, it is beneficial to add and visualize extra structures that are only implied by standard musical notation. As an example of cognition-oriented studies, Ler-dahl and Jackendoff's Generative Theory of Tonal Music provides several different reductions to "represent hierarchical relationships among pitches in a piece" <ref> [3] </ref>. These reductions are notated by means of trees. This might be one of the most obvious cases where the outcome of an analysis, obtained by applying a music theory model, is naturally a graphical object a graph tree structure superimposed on a music stave. <p> Another approach starts by adding color to standard musical notation. Coloring musical phrases can help in recognizing similar horizontal structures in the standard musical notation. When fine-grain analysis tools are used, such as the GTTM method <ref> [3] </ref>, spatial representation can be shifted from the traditional flat 2D view to the 3D space. The outcome of an analysis such as the GTTM method, being a tree, consists of several levels of detailed information about the same music material.

Reference-contexts: Only recently have the descendents of such systems been equipped with adequate visual interfaces, in the attempt to remove inevitable human-computer interface barriers, and to allow a real-time control. One such example is the SuperCollider software environment, which provides a graphical interface to the underlying sound synthesis language <ref> [4] </ref>. 2.3 A tool for music education A third field that can gain benefit from an interactive VR musical notation system is music education, starting from the introductory level, in theory and analysis classes.

Reference-contexts: For example, the structure of a Bach's Canon can be mapped in space using the structure obtained from a form analysis. This method does not use standard music notation, but it's been extensively used in interactive explanations of form analysis bases <ref> [5] </ref>. Another approach starts by adding color to standard musical notation. Coloring musical phrases can help in recognizing similar horizontal structures in the standard musical notation.
