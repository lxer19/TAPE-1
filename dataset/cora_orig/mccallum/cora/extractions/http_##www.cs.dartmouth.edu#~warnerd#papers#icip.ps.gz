Abstract: We present a direct generalization of local trigonometric bases to decompositions of L 2 (R 2 ) with non-rectangular support. We describe decompositions of L 2 (R 2 ) into n subspaces supported on approximate equiangular sectors and work out the case n = 3 in detail. For prototypical decompositions, windowed circular harmonics serve as basis functions. The technique applies equally well to decompositions of higher dimensional space.

Previous work of Xia and Suter <ref> [9] </ref> addresses the use of rhomboidal segmentations. A simple change from rectilinear coordinates to rhomboidal coordinates yields local cosines supported on rhomboids. In a rhomboidal segmentation, the action regions or transition zones may be contained within two, three, four or more neighboring rhomboids.
