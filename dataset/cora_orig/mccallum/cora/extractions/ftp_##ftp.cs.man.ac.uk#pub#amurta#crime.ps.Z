Abstract: This paper describes the use of computer graphics modelling and rendering techniques for the construction of a virtual environment corresponding to a real scene of crime. The aim of the project, conducted in collaboration with the Computer Examinations Unit of the Greater Manchester Police, was to evaluate the utility of virtual environments for scene of crime analysis, briefing and training. We present an illustrated case study of the construction of a virtual environment, intended to match a real-life scene as closely as possible. We describe and evaluate the combination of several approaches including: the use of the the Manchester Scene Description Language for constructing complex geometrical models; the application of a high-quality radiosity algorithm with several novel features based on human perceptual considerations; texture extraction from forensic photography; and experiments with interactive walkthroughs and large-screen stereoscopic display of the virtual environment.

Reference-contexts: The VE was created using a number of tools developed locally, together with the 3D scene modelling language MSDL <ref> [2] </ref>. Geometry was estimated and surface details were extracted from scanned images, captured from photographs provided by GMP, and the VE was then illuminated using the VRAD radiosity system [5, 3, 7, 6]. It is possible to interactively explore the environment, using walk-through software built with the MAVERIK system [8]. <p> However, some photographs contained police rulers, which had been placed in the scene in order to impart a sense of scale. The Manchester Scene Description Language (MSDL) was used to represent the graphics model <ref> [2] </ref>. This is a textual scene description language not unlike VRML or other widely available model formats. 2.1 Geometric model building Generating a complex model from scratch is a challenging task. We therefore made a number of design decisions in order to make the process more manageable.

Reference-contexts: This reduces the time required to illuminate the environment enormously, since a large proportion of the computations performed for each solution have little perceived effect on its quality when considered individually <ref> [4] </ref>. 3.1 Interactive Rendering The rendering software for this model was built using the MAVERIK system, and allows a user to navigate around the environment using a variety of input devices, ranging from a conventional desktop mouse to a 3D mouse with six degrees of freedom.

Reference-contexts: Real world environments (garages in particular) contain considerable accumulations of dirt, and feature many imperfections and other defects resulting from their active history. It is possible to apply blemishes by hand to scene textures in order to fabricate a worn appearance <ref> [9] </ref>. Within the garage model we experimented with the use of dirt textures extracted from the forensic photographs. Some parts of the model were deliberately left clean (untextured) to allow a comparison of presentation methods to be made.
