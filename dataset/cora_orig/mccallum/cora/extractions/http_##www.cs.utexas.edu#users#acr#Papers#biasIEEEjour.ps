Abstract: We explore the problem of transforming n independent and identically biased f1; 1g-valued random variables, X 1 ; : : : ; X n ; into a single f1; 1g value, f(X 1 ; : : : ; X n ), so that this result is as unbiased as possible. In general, no function f produces a completely unbiased result. We perform the first study of the relationship between the bias b of these X i and the rate at which f(X 1 ; : : : ; X n ) can converge to an unbiased f1; 1g random variable (as n ! 1). A f1; 1g random variable has bias b if E(X i ) = b. Fixing a bias b, we explore the rate at which the output bias, jE (f(X 1 ; : : : ; X n ))j, can tend to zero for a function f : f1; 1g fl ! f1; 1g. This is accomplished by classifying the behavior of the natural normalized quantity i this infimum taken over all such f. We show that for rational b, ffi(b) = 1 s , where 1+b 2 = r and s relatively prime). Developing the theory of uniform distribution of sequences to suit our problem, we then explore the case where b is irrational. We prove a new metrical theorem concerning multidimensional Diophantine approximation type from which we show that for (Lebesgue) almost all biases b, ffi(b) = 0. Finally, we show that algebraic biases exhibit curious "boundary" behavior, falling into two classes. Class I. Those algebraics b for which ffi(b) &gt; 0 and furthermore, c 1 ffi(b) c 2 where c 1 and c 2 are positive constants depending only on b's algebraic characteristics. Class II. Those algebraics b for which there exist n &gt; 0 and f : f1; 1g n ! f1; 1g so that E (f(X 1 ; : : : ; X n )) = 0. Notice that this classification excludes the possibility that n p jE (f(X 1 ; : : : ; X n ))j limits to zero (for algebraics). For rational and algebraic biases, we also study the computational problem by restricting f to be a polynomial time computable function. Finally, we discuss natural extensions

(H cs n H s ) ~ (k1)! Where f (s) ~ g (s) means that lim s!0 f (s) Proof: The lemma follows from the following explicit formula for the volume of the set A = f~x : Q <ref> [0; 1] </ref> k : Z 1 Z 1 s=(x 1 x 2 :::x k1 ) =1 s i=0 i! Notice that our notion of discrepancy is defined in terms of rectilinear sets. <p> To bound the discrepancy of this set with respect to these hyperbolic regions, we show the the latter can be well approximated by rectilinear sets. Definition 5: For a constant fi &gt; 1 let L (fi) <ref> [0; 1] </ref> k be the lattice L (fi) = (fi i 1 ; : : : ; fi i k ) : i j 2 N : Finally, let B (fi) be all k-dimensional rectilinear sets of the form B ~ i = B (i 1 ;::: ;i k ) = <p> be the lattice L (fi) = (fi i 1 ; : : : ; fi i k ) : i j 2 N : Finally, let B (fi) be all k-dimensional rectilinear sets of the form B ~ i = B (i 1 ;::: ;i k ) = ~x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> : 0 x j fi i j where (fi i 1 ; : : : ; fi i k ) 2 L (fi). Definition 6: For a set of indices I L (fi), let B I = S ~ i2I B ~ i . <p> Now compose h applied to each block with an XOR of the n log n bits produced by h. V. A Metrical Result Hoping to follow the program developed in the previous section, we would like to see that most biases 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> will produce probabilities P i n () to which we can apply the discrepancy results of Section III. As one would expect, the critical issue is the type of the vector (; 2 ; : : : ; k ). <p> Below we prove a metrical result for vectors of this form. Lemma 22: Fix ffi &gt; 0 and k 2 N. For (Lebesgue) almost all 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, there are only finitely many ~q 2 (N [ f0g) k for which * k X q i i &lt; r (~q) i=1 ln 1+ffi (jq i j m ) Proof: Fix fi 2 (0; 1). <p> For ~q 62 Q fi , we have that Pr [hT ~q (x)i &lt; D ~q ] = Pr fi fl For ~q 62 Q fi , T ([fi; 1]) <ref> [1; Q] </ref> and, since T 0 ~q (x) &gt; 0 for all x 2 [fi; 1], T ~q is invertible on [fi; 1].

(See [28, x5.5.4], for example, for a discussion of Radon-Nikodym derivatives).

Furthermore, notice that T 00 ~q (x) 0 on [fi; 1], so that for two intervals [a; b] and [a + fl; b + fl] [1; Q] (for fl &gt; 0), we have -~q ([a; b]) &gt; -~q ([a + fl; b + fl]) : (3) 11 Now, let j 0 be the smallest natural for which B D ~q <p> Furthermore, notice that T 00 ~q (x) 0 on [fi; 1], so that for two intervals [a; b] and [a + fl; b + fl] <ref> [1; Q] </ref> (for fl &gt; 0), we have -~q ([a; b]) &gt; -~q ([a + fl; b + fl]) : (3) 11 Now, let j 0 be the smallest natural for which B D ~q (fj 0 g) " T ~q ([fi; 1]) 6= ;. <p> Since fi was arbitrary, the lemma is established.

The second part now follows from Theorem 6.

The second part now follows from Theorem 6. Theorem 25: Let be randomly chosen in [0; 1] then, with probability 1, ffi () = 0: Proof: The proof is identical to the proof of Theorem 18, replacing Corollary 16 by Theorem 24. Since the results now hold for any k, the theorem is established. VI. Extensions We notice some natural generalizations of our results.
