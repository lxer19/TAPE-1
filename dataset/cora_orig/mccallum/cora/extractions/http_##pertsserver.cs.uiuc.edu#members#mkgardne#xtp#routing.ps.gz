Abstract: Computer Networks are moving towards interconnection of local networks through the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology. The ATM offers speeds substantially above those available with current wide area networking technologies. However, effective internetworking using the ATM requires three conditions to be met: increasingly powerful routers must be used at the boundaries between ATM services and existing technologies; dynamic routing must be introduced within ATM itself; and unification of previously-distinct addressing domains (networks utilizing a single addressing family) is imperative.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Traditional data networks have been characterized by point-to-point communication, single protocol families, and single addressing plans. Individual protocol families typically have had an associated addressing plan. The development of protocol layering <ref> [1] </ref> has achieved a large measure of independence from the underlying media. However, the existence of the boundaries between different media has required internetworking|a routing function normally associated with the network layer. Proposed routing schemes to date have not, however, solved the problem of interconnecting hosts in different addressing domains.

Reference-contexts: A solution to this problem would provide a valuable service to the networking community. The desire to unify the movement of voice, video and data has led to the development of the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) <ref> [2] </ref>, a design for a wide-applicability, high-speed communications service, which has been standardized by the CCITT [now the Technical Standardization Section of the International Telecommunications Union (TSS-ITU)]. It is seen by many as becoming ubiquitous, and therefore removing the need for internetworking and routing. <p> Initial offerings of the ATM services will require that a route be established at the time that a connection is ordered (static allocation), and future offerings will permit dynamic allocation of routes. Le Boudec <ref> [2] </ref> suggests that this will be based on an extension of existing signalling protocols such as Q.931 [9]. <p> Establishment of routes will be at subscription time, or dynamically, perhaps using an extended Q.931 <ref> [2] </ref>. Referring to Figure 2, the routers above each ATM switch have the 8 responsibility to choose the correct path through an ATM network, and to set the switch tables within each ATM switch so that subsequent data cells will be correctly forwarded.

Reference-contexts: Each object must contain the destination address as part of its overhead (typically in the header). For the Internet Protocol <ref> [3] </ref>, source and destination addresses are each four bytes, and the network must be able to transmit objects up to 576 bytes (larger sizes are permitted, but not required).

Reference-contexts: However, this address space is proving to be inadequate for the number of sites currently connected to the Internet. The Internet Protocol Address Extension (IPAE) project <ref> [4] </ref> is proposing to increase the size to eight bytes for each address. Addressing in OSI networks is variable, between one and 20 octets. These new address formats clearly present increasing overheads for datagram style operations.

Reference-contexts: For shared-media (local) networks, this can be achieved using the broadcast capability of the shared medium, and modes of operation where the membership of the group is not known are possible. For non-shared media, and for wider areas, much more selective mechanisms must be used <ref> [5] </ref>, and it becomes necessary to specify group membership precisely, to prevent wasting bandwidth unnecessarily. While shared-media physical layers have always had multicast or group addresses, it is only recently that network-level addressing plans have begun to have provision for multiple recipients of a transmitted message. <p> On switched media, multicast must be achieved either by replicating the message once for each participant in the group, or by replicating the message explicitly when the paths between the (one) sender and the (multiple) receivers diverge. The MOSPF routing protocol <ref> [5] </ref> defines the Internet procedure for ensuring that each member of the group receives a copy, but unnecessary duplicate messages are not sent along shared paths.

Reference-contexts: While shared-media physical layers have always had multicast or group addresses, it is only recently that network-level addressing plans have begun to have provision for multiple recipients of a transmitted message. The Internet addressing scheme dedicates one part of its address space for group addressing <ref> [6] </ref>. Within the OSI framework, a project is currently underway to define what multi-peer addressing means [7]. 2.4 Routing When two end systems that are not on the same (shared medium) LAN need to communicate, it is necessary to route the data through the underlying physical network.

Reference-contexts: This is precisely the way in which route values are used in XTP (see Section 3.1). This separates the routing problem into two parts|establishing the route, and using the route to move data. Many routing protocols exist <ref> [8] </ref>, corresponding to each of the protocol stacks and/or addressing families that exist. The purpose of each of these routing protocols is to maintain the distributed database that contains the routing information, in the face of the continually changing topology of the network.

Reference-contexts: Le Boudec [2] suggests that this will be based on an extension of existing signalling protocols such as Q.931 <ref> [9] </ref>. Switching of ATM cells is based on the cell labels in an ATM cell|at each ATM switch, a routing table (constructed by the signalling protocol software) is consulted to determine the next edge to follow in the ATM network, and the new cell label to be used.

Reference-contexts: the router than is necessary for routing unicast packets. 2.6 Intelligence The need to introduce new capabilities in the telecommunications network, and to facilitate and accelerate service implementation and provisioning in a multi-vendor environment, has led to the introduction of a series of Recommendations within the CCITT for Intelligent Networks <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> The implementation of generalized addressing will require more "intelligence" in routers than is normally found in today's products. This "intelligence" may be seen as a value-added service that might be offered using the Intelligent Network <ref> [10] </ref> platform. XTP has the mechanisms necessary for multicasting of packets. <p> The value-added functions would have to be structured as user processes "listening" at a specific address. Within the part of the network that provides an IN <ref> [10] </ref> service, however, routing could be formulated as an offered service.

Reference-contexts: In this section, the pertinent properties of the protocol are presented, and then the solutions to the problems outlined in the previous section are shown. 3.1 The Xpress Transfer Protocol The Xpress Transfer Protocol (XTP) <ref> [11, 12] </ref> is a so-called transfer protocol, specifically designed for high speed networks. It incorporates functionalities of both Network and Transport levels, as defined in the OSI reference model. <p> This provides great flexibility, in that XTP can exist within any system that uses one of the addressing plans contemplated by the XTP Protocol Definition <ref> [11] </ref>. Some uses of this flexibility will be indicated later. XTP has a variety of packet types, of which the FIRST packet, the DATA packet, and the CNTL packet are pertinent to this paper. The FIRST packet carries an Address Segment, and may also carry user data.

Reference-contexts: programming methods and environments are maturing, so in the long run, using this kind of parallel computer would be a very cost effective solution. 4.2 A Parallel XTP Switch in the IN Context The parallelization of an XTP switch as defined in the previous section has been described in reference <ref> [13] </ref>. Here we just present an overview of the design of our parallel XTP switch. The sequential XTP switch has been broken down into a set of independent subswitches (one for each available processor), each one dealing with a subset of the incoming and outgoing links (see Figure 3).
