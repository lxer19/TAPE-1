Abstract: Mobility support in IP networks requires servers to forward packets to mobile hosts and to maintain information pertaining to a mobile host's location in the network. In the mobile Internet Protocol (mobile-IP), location and packet forwarding functions are provided by servers referred to as home agents. These home agents may become the bottleneck when there are a large number of mobile hosts in the network. In this paper, we consider the design and analysis of a replicated server architecture in which multiple home agents are used to provide mobility support. In order to minimize the delay across the home agents, one of the key aspects is the design of load balancing schemes in which a home agent may transfer the control of a mobile host to another home agent in the same network. The methods for triggering the transfer and the policy for selecting the next home agent define various load balancing schemes which have different performance characteristics. In this paper, we design a protocol that forms the building block for implementing such load balancing schemes, and we then study the performance characteristics of three selection schemes, namely, random, round-robin, and join the shortest queue (JSQ), and three transfers policies namely, timer-, counter- and threshold-based. The key results of this study are as follows: 1) The results show that both random and round-robin selection policies can yield modest load balancing gains, and that these gains increase when the traffic is more bursty (burstiness is defined as the ratio of the peak arrival rate to the mean arrival rate) as well as when there are more home agents. 2) The threshold-based transfer policy performs better than timer-based and counter-based policies, since in threshold-based policies transfers are made only when the queue is overloaded, unlike counter- and timer-based policies in which transfers can be made from an unloaded home agent to an overloaded home agent.

Reference-contexts: NCR-9703275. 1 new network, and messages sent to the original IP address need to be forwarded to the new IP address. In the mobile-IP protocol <ref> [1] </ref>, this support is provided by two servers: the foreign agent and the home agent.

Reference-contexts: One way to improve the mobile-IP protocol is route optimization <ref> [2] </ref> in which a message may be routed directly to the temporary IP address of the mobile host. Route optimization is accomplished by having the source host maintain a binding cache which contains the temporary IP address of the mobile host to which it is sending a message.

Reference-contexts: As a result, route optimization is optional in IPv4. Recently, another transparent scheme has been proposed which requires additional agent functionality and is referred to as the External Agent <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Similar to the random policy, the current home agent may also be selected as the next home agent. Intuitively, JSQ should provide the best performance over other selection policies for a given transfer policy <ref> [5] </ref>. The random and round-robin policies are the simplest from an implementation point of view. The JSQ policy is difficult to implement in a shared media LAN, and it requires additional overhead.

Reference-contexts: There are a number of possible ways to balance the load among the home agents. The traditional approach of transferring packets from a loaded home agent to another home agent has been studied in great detail in previous works <ref> [6] </ref>. The drawback of this approach is that the overhead of transferring a large 5 number of individual packets among the various servers may be high, and may also result in some packets being transferred more than once.

Reference-contexts: A closed from expression for the delay is not available. Instead we use a numerical approach for solving such models as given in <ref> [8] </ref>. 5 Results In order to validate the analytical model of the random selection policy derived in the previous section and to investigate the performance of alternative selection policies, we develop a simulation model of the network.

Reference-contexts: In this analysis, we assume that the two arrival processes are independent. Furthermore, instead of solving a two-priority queueing model, we will use the shadow server approximation proposed in <ref> [9] </ref> to analyze two-priority queues. In this approximation, we will aggregate the high priority traffic by appropriately modifying the service time of the Class 2 requests.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A key objective in providing mobility support is to ensure that mobile hosts are able to send and receive messages when they move within a network or from one network to another. In IP networks, routing is based on the IP address of the host <ref> [12] </ref>, [15]. When a host moves from one IP subnet to another, all IP packets addressed to that host will be routed to the host's old network. <p> Finally, in Section 7, we conclude this paper and discuss some key future research directions. 2 Preliminaries 2.1 Address Resolution Protocol and Its Extensions The address resolution protocol (ARP) is used in the TCP/IP protocol suite <ref> [12] </ref> to resolve network layer IP addresses to data link layer MAC addresses. In an Ethernet, a host which requires an address translation broadcasts an ARP query which specifies an IP address. The destination host responds with an ARP reply containing the requested MAC address. <p> Each host also maintains an ARP cache which contains the translations of IP addresses to MAC addresses. There are two extensions to ARP that are used in basic mobile-IP: 1) the proxy ARP and 2) the gratuitous ARP. 3 Proxy ARP <ref> [12] </ref> is typically used when two physical networks with the same network ID are interconnected by a router. In such network, the router answers ARP requests on one of its networks for a host on another of its networks. <p> This results in the destination IP address being mapped to the data link layer address of the router. All subsequent packets for the destination host are then sent to the router which then forwards the packets to the destination host in the other network. In gratuitous ARP <ref> [12] </ref>, the source host sends out an ARP request with a translation of its own IP address. <p> When the foreign agent receives the acknowledgment, it updates its own table and relays the reply to the mobile host. In the home network, the home agent 4 uses a gratuitous ARP <ref> [12] </ref> to update the ARP cache of all the hosts and routers that currently have an ARP cache entry for the mobile host. <p> IP packets destined for a mobile host which is outside of its home network are routed through the mobile host's home agent. The home agent acts as a proxy for the mobile host, and responds to ARP queries for the mobile host with a proxy ARP reply <ref> [12] </ref>. The result is that the mobile host's IP address is now bound to the link layer address of the home agent, and all packets for the mobile host are now directed to the home agent.
