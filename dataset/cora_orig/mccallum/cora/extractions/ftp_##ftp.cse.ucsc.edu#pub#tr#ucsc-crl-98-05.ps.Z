Abstract: We describe a new hybrid approach to modeling and animating animals. A predefined skin is modeled as a triangle mesh, such as may be purchased from a digital model vendor, or generated with a typical modeling program. This skin is then attached to the underlying bone, muscle, and tissue model. The rest shape of the skin is exactly as given in the surface model of the animal. Internal components bones, muscles, and general tissue are directly modeled with triangle meshes or ellipsoids. Changes in joint angle result in changes to the position of bones and generalized tissue, and in changes to the shapes of muscles. The attached skin vertices move with their underlying components, resulting in natural-looking deformations to the animal modeled. This alternative approach to modeling skin allows for greater realism or detail without requiring more accurate internals, and it allows preexisting animal models to be realistically deformed using an anatomically based method.

Reference-contexts: Our modeling approach involves the following steps: (1) obtain a surface model of the desired animal, or create one using a modeling package such as SGI Alias/Wavefront <ref> [1] </ref>, (2) triangulate the surface model, if not already triangles, (3) specify a body hierarchy and rest position that fits within the surface model, (2) design individual muscles, bones, and generalized tissues to approximately fit within the skin, and (3) attach skin surface vertices to the nearest underlying tissue. <p> The horse skeleton consists of 45 individual triangle-mesh bones based on a human skeleton model from Viewpoint DataLabs [13] and altered using SGI Alias/Wavefront software <ref> [1] </ref> to be more horse-like. There are 42 ellipsoidal bones for the tail, feet, ankles, lower front legs, rear legs, sacral vertebrae, skull, and jaw. The unadorned skeleton in rest state can be seen in Figure 1. <p> Acquired a polygonal model of the desired animal. These can be purchased from digital model vendors such as Viewpoint DataLabs [13] (as we did), or created using modeling software such as SGI Alias/Wavefront <ref> [1] </ref>. 2. Examined the skin, and decided on a tree structure and number of segments. We modified the monkey hierarchy used in [48], in particular removing the extraneous fingers and toes. 9 3. Fit the hierarchy within the skin, taking into account the location of the joints.

Reference-contexts: From the early days of robotics and animation research, robots, humans, animals and other articulated 2 bodies have been represented using a tree-structured hierarchy of rigid segments connected by flexible joints.

Historically, most representational and modeling schemes for humans and animals have been based on such hierarchies; beyond that, they diverge greatly in how (and if) the skin and internal components are modeled and deformed.

Reference-contexts: Once the animal model has been defined and the skin attached, animation is accomplished as described in [48, 50].

Through a highly laborious process, skilled modelers digitize physical models, which are then painstakingly animated by highly trained and talented animators; both human effort and CPU time are considerable.

We present a hybrid modeling and animation approach that combines the advantages of each of these previously unrelated paradigms. Like previous anatomically based approaches, the underlying model consists of individual muscles, bones, and generalized tissues, which mimic actual components of the animal body. <p> Clearly, for any significant joint angle changes, the polygons around the joints would deform unpleasantly. Magnanent-Thalmann et al. <ref> [29, 30] </ref>, describe a method in which there is associated with each joint a specific transformation, which they call a joint-dependent local deformation or JLD. <p> Gourret et al. [20] used a enhanced this approach with a (skin surface) finite element method <ref> [42, 30, 12, 43] </ref> to model skin deformations of a hand during grasping. Komatsu [26] presents a technique in which a hierarchy is covered with piecewise biquartic Bezier patches and Gregory patches. Control points surround the segments. <p> Attempts to model the deformation of skin by applying various techniques to transform a surface-only model based on joint angles and segment positions have met with limited success. Methods such as <ref> [29, 30] </ref> do work to some extent, but are ad-hoc, must be tuned for the joints, most likely fail for any sort of twisting, and may be difficult if not impossible for complex joints such as hips or shoulders. 10 The methods in which an a-priori surface is embedded in a

Reference-contexts: From the early days of robotics and animation research, robots, humans, animals and other articulated 2 bodies have been represented using a tree-structured hierarchy of rigid segments connected by flexible joints. These hierarchies are generally constructed in the shape of the underlying skeleton <ref> [4, 6, 31] </ref>. Historically, most representational and modeling schemes for humans and animals have been based on such hierarchies; beyond that, they diverge greatly in how (and if) the skin and internal components are modeled and deformed.

Reference-contexts: Natural-appearing skin, fur, and hair are complex but important components of realistic models. Hanrahan and Krueger demonstrated realistic skin tones [22]. Noteworthy fur [25, 35, 46] and hair [2] have been produced. Reaction-diffusion approaches <ref> [44, 51] </ref> and spot noise [47] can simulate textures resembling animal fur.
