Abstract: This paper describes a lexical acquisition mechanism that was implemented in order to increase the robustness of a Natural Language Processing system. Although the mechanism was not intended to be a cognitive model of children's language acquisition, it demonstrates many similarities with psycholinguistic findings. In particular, the structure of the domain knowledge representation forces the system to take a bipolar approach to learning nouns and verbs. Psycholinguistic studies demonstrate differing treatment of nouns and verbs by children and suggest a structural basis for this difference. The knowledge-level similarities between our system and human linguistic knowledge make it possible to infer that children must adopt a similar strategy to effectively learn word meanings.

Reference-contexts: Thus the children in the experiments were labeling the events with the most specific label possible. This contradicts the results found in acquisition of nouns, which demonstrate that specific subordinate terms are used much less frequently than basic-level terms as labels for familiar objects. <ref> (Behrend 1990, p. 694) </ref>. These results point to a fundamental difference between children's acquisition of nouns and verbs, one that can be most readily explained by differences in the underlying mental representation of the different concepts. Gentner calls the basis for this difference the referential / relational distinction.

Reference-contexts: They suggest that objects are organized in a structured hierarchy so that nearby elements share many of the same features. The relational elements that are expressed by verbs are represented in a matrix structure with nodes connecting across the various object hierarchies. Graesser, Hopkinson, and Schmid <ref> (Graesser, Hopkinson, & Schmid 1987) </ref> have recently done 7 These results are tempered somewhat by recent suggestions that the findings may be specific to the English language.

Reference-contexts: Thus, Camille suggests an explanation for the differences described in the psycholinguistic literature. Unlike other acquisition systems (Zernik 1987; Granger 1977; Salveter 1979; Selfridge 1986), and in accord with psy 1 General correspondences of the initial implementation of this system with psycholinguistic findings were described in <ref> (Hastings, Lytinen, & Lindsay 1991) </ref>. cholinguistic theories like Syntactic Bootstrapping (Gleitman 1990; Naigles 1990), Camille takes full advantage of LINK's grammatical knowledge in making its inferences. The acquisition procedure takes place during parsing and interacts with the syntactic decisions made by the parser.

Reference-contexts: To drive the search, the semantic constraints, which are normally used to limit attachment of slot-fillers to the head verb, interact with the evidence provided 2 The actual process that Camille uses is described more fully in <ref> (Hastings 1994) </ref>.

This is an overly simplistic assumption. It may be that learning a new word sometimes requires the addition of a new node in the concept hierarchy as well. Another extension of Camille <ref> (Hastings 1994) </ref> addresses concept acquisition within the context of a lexical acquisition system. In accordance with the results described herein, object concepts were found to be much easier to learn than action concepts. Another limitation of the Camille system was brought to light by testing on larger data sets.

Reference-contexts: The structure facilitates generalization, an ability that is key to learning and reasoning. It also provides efficient storage of information. Furthermore, various psychological studies support the existence of hierarchical structures in the brain ((Kaplan, Weaver, & French 1990) and <ref> (Keil 1991) </ref>, for example). The use of a hierarchy to represent objects also seems intuitively correct. For representing actions and relations, the utility of this structure is not so obvious.

Reference-contexts: Introduction We have developed an incremental approach to learning word meanings from their usage in example sentences. This approach has been developed and implemented as part of the LINK Natural Language Processing system <ref> (Lytinen & Roberts 1989) </ref>. The learning system, called Camille (Contextual Acquisition Mechanism for Incremental Lexeme Learning), selects candidate word meanings from a collection of frames, stored in a concept hierarchy which is part of LINK's knowledge base. The original motivation for building Camille was to improve the robustness of LINK.

Reference-contexts: The nature of the knowledge LINK's knowledge representation consists of an inheritance hierarchy of domain-independent and domain-specific concepts, or frames. Figure 1 shows some of LINK's domain-specific object concepts which were used during our participation in ARPA's Third and Fourth Message Understanding Competitions, or MUC-3 and 4 <ref> (Sundheim 1992) </ref> (the shading will be explained later). The MUC task involved the extraction of information from newspaper articles which described terrorist activities in Latin America; thus, the frames encode knowledge about the domain of terrorism.
