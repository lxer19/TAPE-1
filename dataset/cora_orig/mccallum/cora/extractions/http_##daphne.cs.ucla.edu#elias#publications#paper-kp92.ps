Abstract: We show that for the vast majority of satisfiable 3CNF formulae, the local search heuristic that starts at a random truth assignment, and repeatedly flips the variable that improves the number of satisfied clauses the most, almost always succeeds in discovering a satisfying truth assignment. Naturally, when the formula is unsatisfiable, this heuristic will not return a satisfying truth assignment, and so it will be in some sense "correct." We therefore ask the question: If the formula is satisfiable, how often will this heuristic return a satisfying truth assignment? We show that the answer is almost always! Naturally, there is nothing surprising or original about an NP-complete problem with a good average-case algorithm under the most natural probabilistic distribution. What is perhaps a little surprising is that the problem is so fundamental, the algorithm so simple, and the proof so easy. Let F be a Boolean formula of n variables in conjunctive normal form with three literals per clause (the familiar NP-complete 3SAT problem, Garey and Johnson 1979). Suppose that F is satisfiable, say by a truth assignment ^ T . We shall show that, for almost all such F , the greedy algorithm will in fact discover ^ T with very high probability. The reason is, of course, that most satisfiable formulae have just one satisfying truth assignment. Intuitively then, the greedy algorithm always discovers the satisfying assignment, since the clauses always "point the way." The probabilistic calculation that follows makes this intuition precise. If the greedy heuristic starts at a truth assignment that agrees with ^ T in very few variables, then it is likely that a local optimum that is not a global optimum will be found. However, it is straightforward to show that such starting points are very rare. Let us call a truth assignment bad if it agrees with ^ T in fewer than ( 1
