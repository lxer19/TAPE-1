Note: BRICS Basic Research in Computer Science Centre of the Danish National Research Foundation  1 Notes of a course given at BRICS in spring 1997. The current version is not complete and absolutely not polished. In particular, I am aware of several mistakes in the notes. The final version is to be expected at http://www.brics.dk/ butz/courses/spring97.html around July or August.

Reference-contexts: In the following exercises we derive `comparison' functors between sheaf toposes. The statement of Exercise 13.8 (ii) appeared in <ref> [1] </ref>, Expose III, and is called `The comparison Lemma'. <p> The induced geometric morphism b = b : Sh (C ; J) ! Sh (D ; K) satisfies b fl (F )(D) = F ffi (D) and b fl is full and faithful. (Grothendieck & Co. call a functor such that F ffi is a sheaf continuous, see <ref> [1] </ref>, III.1.1.) 13.5 Let : (D ; K) ! (C ; J) be a functor between small sites which is co-continuous. (i) Show that A : C ! Sh (D ; K); C 7! a D (C (; C)) is flat and continuous.

Reference-contexts: Examples 2.4 (i) (Sheaves over topological spaces.) For X a topological space and the partial ordered set OX equipped with the standard topology the definition of a sheaf above is literally the same as the definition of a sheaf on X given in algebraic topology, see for example <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: D in D and any arrow f : C ! F (D) there exist morphisms fi: D 0 ! D in D , : F (D 0 ) ! C and ffi: C ! F (D 0 ) such that ffi = id C and ff = f fi (see <ref> [5] </ref>). 8.3 Show that the canonical geometric morphism E ! Sets always preserves universal quantification.

Reference-contexts: ; K) ! Sh (C ; J) is hyperconnected. 13.7 Use the previous exercise to show that the functor : (C ; J) ! (P C ; J C ) from a site (C ; J) to its preorder reflection (see Exercise 4.8) induces a hyperconnected geometric morphism. 13.8 (Compare <ref> [6] </ref>.) (i) Prove that a functor : (D ; K) ! (C ; J) satisfying (i)-(v) induces an equivalence of categories Sh (D ; K) ! Sh (C ; J).

Reference-contexts: The following exercise is taken from <ref> [7] </ref>. 12.4 Let X be a topological space and C the sheaf (on X) of real valued continuous functions, C = Cts (; R). (i) Prove that Sh (X) j= 8x : C (::x = 0 ! x = 0), for 0 the zero global section X ! R. (ii) Let

Reference-contexts: P + is coordinatewise defined as a filtered colimit (the filtered category being the partial order on sieves), and filtered colimits commute with finite limits (see <ref> [8] </ref>, Section IX.8). 2 Finally, we characterize monos in the caegory Sh (C ; J ): Lemma 3.4 A map ff: E ! F of sheaves in Sh (C ; J ) is a mono if and only if each map ff C is injective, that is, if and only if

Reference-contexts: intervals (non-degenerate linear orders with endpoints): T lin [ f8x (b x ^ x t); :b = tg: (Then the first axiom of T lin is redundant.) The classifying topos of this set of axioms is equivalent to the presheaf topos of simplicial sets, Sets op , see for example <ref> [9] </ref>, Section VIII.8. Example 14.10 (Rings.) Let fp-rings denote the full subcategory of the category of rings, consisting of finitely presented rings. The category fp-rings is equivalent to a small category, with objects of the form Z [x 1 ; : : : ; x n ]= I ; 14. <p> THE CLASSIFYING TOPOS OF A GEOMETRIC THEORY 49 finitely generated polynomial rings over Z, quotient by an ideal. The presheaf topos " fp-rings op is equivalent to the non-trivial ring classifier (see <ref> [9] </ref>, Section VIII.2). The category fp-rings op carries a natural Grothendieck topology, generated by specifying that the two arrows Z [x] ! Z [x; y]= (xy y 1) ; Z [x] ! Z [x; y]= (xy 1) ; form a co-cover.

Reference-contexts: More precisely, the theory T (C;J) is formulated in some large enough L (C;J) ! (S). (If F = Sh (X) for a topological space X the axioms can be read as follows (cf. <ref> [10] </ref>): (1) and (2) state that models are C -bundles. (3) expresses a continuity property while axiom (4) expresses that the C -bundle is non-empty. (5) says that the action is transitive and (6) that the action is free. <p> Example 14.9 (Non-empty linear orders.) A non-empty linear order is a model of the axioms T lin : 8x x x 8x8y (x y ^ y x ! x = y) The classifying topos of T lin is equivalent to the presheaf topos of co-simplicial sets, Sets (see <ref> [10] </ref>).
