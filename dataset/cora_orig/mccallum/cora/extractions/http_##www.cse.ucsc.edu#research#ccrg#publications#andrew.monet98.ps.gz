Abstract: The Group Allocation Multiple Access with Packet-Sensing (GAMA-PS) protocol for scheduling real-time and datagram traffic in a wireless LAN is specified and analyzed. By maintaining a dynamically-sized cycle that changes in length depending on the amount of network traffic, GAMA-PS is able to efficiently control channel access while ensuring that there are no collisions of data packets. Each cycle contains a contention period and a group-transmission period; a station with data to send competes for membership in the transmission group by using packet sensing to successfully complete an RTS/CTS message exchange during the contention period. Once a station is a member of the transmission group, it is able to transmit a collision-free data packet during each cycle; as long as a station has data to send, it maintains its position in the group.

Reference-contexts: An attractive feature of CSMA protocols is that they are simple to implement; however, because a station must contend before it transmits each packet, CSMA and ALOHA <ref> [2] </ref> are unstable under heavy loads. Furthermore, in the presence of hidden terminals, CSMA's performance degrades to the performance of ALOHA.

Reference-contexts: Because of the instability under heavy loads of basic contention-based protocols, many contention-free protocols have been proposed; these include fixed assignment (in time or frequency), polling, token passing or dynamic reservations. Fixed assignment protocols are typically based on TDMA (e.g. <ref> [11] </ref>). In a TDMA network, time is divided into frames that provide each node with a transmission slot over which it can transmit data without collisions. A limitation of TDMA is that the channel is wasted when traffic is bursty.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Existing media access control (MAC) protocols can be divided into two groups: contention-based and contention-free. A contention-based protocol requires a station to compete for control of the transmission channel each time it sends a packet. In the past, CSMA (carrier sense multiple access) protocols <ref> [19] </ref> have been used in several packet-radio networks; CSMA protocols attempt to prevent a station from transmitting simultaneously with other stations (within its transmission range) by asking the station to listen before it transmits. <p> Section 2 describes how GAMA-PS provides dynamic reservations of the channel and shows that its implementation complexity is comparable with that of CSMA <ref> [19] </ref> protocols. GAMA-PS builds a dynamically-sized cycle that grows and shrinks depending upon traffic demand. Each cycle consists of a contention period of up to a maximum duration and a group-transmission period during which one or more stations transmit data packets without collisions.
