Abstract: We describe a GOMS model of a ship-board Radar Operators behavior while monitoring air and sea traffic. GOMS is a technique that has been successfully used in Human-Computer Interaction to generate engineering models of human performance. Based on the GOMS model developed, we identified those portions of the task where an intelligent agent would be most able to assist operators in the performance of their duties, and the nature of the knowledge that will be required for the task. We present the results of a simulated execution of the model in a sample scenario, which predicted the operators responses with a high degree of accuracy.

Reference-contexts: The classic example is that of a typist using a word-processor to make corrections that have been marked on a printed copy of a manuscript; the top-level goal is to edit the online version of the manuscript, and the unit task is simply to make the next correction <ref> (Card, Moran, and Newell 1982) </ref>. We have written the GOMS model using NGOMSL, or Natural GOMS Language, (Kieras, 1988; 1994). <p> This scheme can be used in general when deciding when it is appropriate to communicate information between agents. By creating a knowledge-level description of a task <ref> (Newell, 1982) </ref>, GOMS models provide the means to predict the users goals, beliefs, and priorities, and therefore her actions.

Reference-contexts: However, there are potentially conicting goals that must be satisfied when choosing the next task to perform. This process of goal selection and prioritization can be understood within the context of a small class of basic motivations <ref> (Simon, 1967) </ref>. Morignot & Hayes-Roth (in press) have interpreted these motivations within the domain of mobile robots; we will attempt to create analogous instantiations for the motivations of a Radar Operator (see Table 1).
