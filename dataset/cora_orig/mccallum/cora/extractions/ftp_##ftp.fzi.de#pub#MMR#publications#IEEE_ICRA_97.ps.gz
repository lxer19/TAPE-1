Abstract: The determination of the current absolute position provides the basis for any path planning and navigation purposes of mobile robots. Here, a navigation system is proposed which uses floor tiles that contain different deterministic or random patterns with encoded information for the determination of the robot's absolute position. This navigation code has powerful error control capabilities. Both the information theoretical foundations of such an approach as well as the design of the encoding and decoding processes are considered.

Reference-contexts: If the symbols which are extracted by f d reflect the randomness of the tile production process, then the corresponding random codewords have good error control capabilities (according to Shannon's random coding argument of the information theory <ref> [10] </ref>). Such a code is good if the Hamming distances d H of the codewords have the binomial distribution with mean value N=2 [11]. The Hamming distance d H between two random codewords is the number of corresponding symbol squares in which symbols from two codewords are different.

Reference-contexts: However, errors of several neighboring erroneous symbol squares (burst errors caused by shadow or larger objects on the floor) require the introduction of redundancy through an algebraic burst-error correcting code. A good choice are codes from the family of Reed-Solomon codes <ref> [12] </ref> with appropriately chosen parameters. In Fig. 7 an example of symbol patterns and a tile realized by the B (R; N ) q = B (1:3; 7) 8 Reed-Solomon code [13] is shown. This code can correct two symbol errors and has M = 512 code-words (tiles).

Another possibility is the use of the larger B (0:8; 15) 16 Reed-Solomon code which can correct six symbol errors and has M = 4096 code-words.
