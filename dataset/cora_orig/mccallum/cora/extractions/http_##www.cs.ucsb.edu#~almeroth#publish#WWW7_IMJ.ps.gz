Abstract: Straightforward, one-way delivery of video programming through television sets has existed for many decades. In the 1980s, new services like Pay-Per-View and Video-on-Demand were touted as the "killer application" for next-generation Internet and TV services. However, the hype has quickly died away leaving only hard technical problems and costly systems. As an alternative, and what we propose, is a new paradigm offering flexibility in how programs are requested and scheduled for playout, ranging from complete viewer control (true VoD), to complete service provider control (traditional broadcast or cable TV). In this paper, we describe our proposed jukebox paradigm and relate it to other on-demand paradigms. Our new paradigm presents some challenges of its own, including how to best schedule viewer requests, how to provide VCR-style interactive functions, and how to track viewer usage patterns. In addition to addressing these issues we also present our implementation of a jukebox-based service called the Interactive Multimedia Jukebox (IMJ). The IMJ provides scheduling via the World Wide Web (WWW) and content delivery via the Multicast Backbone (MBone). We discuss the challenges of building a functioning system and our ongoing efforts to improve the jukebox paradigm.

Reference-contexts: These systems are expensive and provide few revenue opportunities for service providers. One solution is to batch multiple requests for the same program into a group and then service them using one audio/video stream multicast to all group members <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. This solution was mainly proposed for cable-TV based infrastructures which provide many channels, a large numbers of customers, and broadcast-only communication. Within the Internet, the MBone [3] has been the focal point for developing multicast [4] and real-time protocols [5] for the scalable delivery of multimedia streams. <p> The paper is concluded in Section 5. 2 Program Scheduling Paradigms 2.1 Background Our jukebox paradigm is based on a hybrid of program scheduling paradigms ranging from newer proposals like true Video-on-Demand (VoD) and near Video-on-Demand to more traditional services like Pay-Per-View (PPV) and broadcast television <ref> [1, 2, 16, 17] </ref>. Traditional television is based on the premise of delivering as many channels of programming. Viewer choice is the ability to switch between any of the available channels. <p> The assumption is that the network has an efficient multicast delivery facility and can provide a single program stream to several viewers. Near VoD has proven to be a scalable alternative to true VoD <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. The biggest limitation of near VoD is that it requires large viewer populations to achieve sufficient economies of scale. <p> Using this definition, true VoD systems are unscalable because each additional viewer requires roughly the same set of resources required to deliver a program stream as was required by the previous viewer <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. On the other hand, near VoD is scalable because additional viewers can be accommodated by batching them with others who make the same program requests. One major disadvantage of near VoD is that there is still a relationship between the number of channels and the number of viewers. <p> This allows interactivity to be provided using only a small number of additional groups at specific offset intervals. This type of interactivity is comparable to a similar concept proposed for near VoD systems <ref> [1] </ref>. While the advantage is that fewer resources are required, the disadvantage is that playout control is more coarse-grained. Also, this type of interactivity is only useful for large systems were interactivity is expected to occur frequently. * Full Interactivity: Full interactivity can be provided using one of two methods.

Reference-contexts: Programs are stored in compressed format, ready for transmission. The video server does not require significant CPU resources, but a system providing a large number of high quality channels may require fast disk access techniques <ref> [18] </ref>. 8 * Network: The network must provide an efficient multicast facility and have sufficient bandwidth to meeting viewer quality expectations. The network must also have bi-directional capability in order to receive viewer requests and feedback.

Reference-contexts: With the WWW providing the interface, the MBone provides the multicast delivery service over the Internet and the MBone audio and video tools provide delivery, decoding and display functions. Before being made available on the IMJ, content is encoded as an RTP packet stream using the rtpdump utility <ref> [19] </ref>. Quality levels for both audio and video are set at typical MBone session levels. Audio is encoded at roughly 39 Kbps using the Intel DVI audio format. Video is encoded at a constant bit rate of 128 Kbps using the H.261 coding standard. <p> Embedded HTML flags automatically reload the page every 5 minutes. When it is time to start a particular program, the scheduler uses a remote shell command to the video server to start the audio and video streams via the rtpplay utility <ref> [19] </ref>. Stream synchronization is provided via RTP [5]. Because there are only two channels and per-stream bandwidth is relatively low, there is no need for specialized server hardware.

Reference-contexts: This information is collected using a tool designed and developed by the authors called Mlisten <ref> [20] </ref>. In the past, it has been used to monitor multicast group behavior in traditional MBone sessions. The IMJ effort has been immensely successful as a prototype but the data to-date does not suggest that the IMJ is in danger of competing with international broadcasting companies.

Reference-contexts: Given that viewers will want different quality levels, there are a number of solutions worth evaluating. 1.
