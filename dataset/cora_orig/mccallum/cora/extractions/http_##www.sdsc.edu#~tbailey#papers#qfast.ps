Title: Combining evidence using p-values: Application to sequence homology searches  
Author: Timothy L. Bailey and Michael Gribskov 
Note: From: Bioinformatics, 14(48-54), 1998.  
Abstract: Motivation: To illustrate an intuitive and statistically valid method for combining independent sources of evidence that yields a p-value for the complete evidence, and to apply it to the problem of detecting simultaneous matches to multiple patterns in sequence homology searches. Results: In sequence analysis, two or more (approximately) independent measures of the membership of a sequence (or sequence region) in some class are often available. We would like to estimate the likelihood of the sequence being a member of the class in view of all the available evidence. An example is estimating the significance of the observed match of a macromolecular sequence (DNA or protein) to a set of patterns (motifs) that characterize a biological sequence family. An intuitive way to do this is to express each piece of evidence as a p-value, and then use the product of these p-values as the measure of membership in the family. We derive a formula and algorithm (qfast) for calculating the statistical distribution of the product of n independent p-values. We demonstrate that sorting sequences by this p-value effectively combines the information present in multiple motifs, leading to highly accurate and sensitive sequence homology searches. Availability: The mast sequence homology search algorithm incorporating the results described here is available for interactive use and downloading at URL http://www.sdsc.edu/MEME.

Reference-contexts: of pseudo-random sequences, * using mast to calculate the combined p-value of each pseudo-random sequence and a family of motifs, * comparing the observed and expected distributions of combined p-values, and, * measuring the classification accuracy of combined p values when searching a database of real sequences (swiss-prot release 28 <ref> (Bairoch 1994) </ref>). We chose 75 sequence families from the Prosite database of protein sequence families (Bairoch 1995). (The families chosen are listed in Bailey & Grib-skov (1997)). The meme motif discovery program (Bai-ley & Elkan 1995) was used to generate a set of five motifs for each sequence family.

The match score of a single motif compared to a random sequence is a discrete random variable whose distribution can be exactly calculated (Staden 1990).

Reference-contexts: If P i ; i = 1; : : : ; n, are independent random variables each distributed uniformly on the interval [0; 1], the statistic 1 2 ln i=1 has a chi-square distribution with 2n degrees of freedom <ref> (Oosterhoff 1969) </ref>. To show this, note that 2 ln P i is distributed chi-square with 2 degrees of freedom and that the sum of independent, chi-square variables is chi-square with degrees of freedom equal to the sum of the individual degrees of freedom.

Reference-contexts: The overall validity of using the product of p-values statistic for measuring the significance of sequence similarity, and thus, homology, is further supported by Fig tif columns <ref> (Pietrokovski 1996) </ref> divided by the width of the shorter motif. This metric ranges from -1 to 1, with a value of 1 indicating identical motifs.

The match score of a single motif compared to a random sequence is a discrete random variable whose distribution can be exactly calculated <ref> (Staden 1990) </ref>. From this distribution, we can calculate the p-value of the match score of a target sequence-the probability of observing a match score at least as good when the motif is compared to a random sequence.
