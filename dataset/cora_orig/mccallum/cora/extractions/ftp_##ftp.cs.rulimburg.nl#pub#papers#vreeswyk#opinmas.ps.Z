Abstract: Protocols for intelligent agents are difficult to write. This is partially because intelligent agents accommodate their interaction to the situation that arises. As a result, the interaction among intelligent agents cannot be governed by a fixed protocol. In this paper I describe an open protocol paradigm for reasoning in a multi-agent system with decentralized control. An open protocol is a collection of rules of interaction that lies open to further alteration and adjustment. I explore the notion of open protocol, and show how it can be altered by rational claims. This may lead to further insights concerning the government of interaction among intelligent agents in multi-agent systems.

A major problem in the design of multi-agent systems is the design of the protocols. <p> In his recent book, he discusses much of the law of the U.S. federal amending process and convincingly argues that any mature juridical system inevitably involves self-regulating constructions (Suber, 1990). Besides Hewitt, Loui, and perhaps Suber, there are other researchers arguing for the importance of open protocol (Miller, 1977), <ref> (Sartor, 1993) </ref>. The problem, however, is that, to my 333333333333333333 1 This is a legal concept. It is interesting to note that other important legal concepts, like defeasibility of arguments and decisions, preceded the introduction of due process in artificial intelligence. <p> Together with the hypothesis of a multi-agent environment, I construct a simple model of (artificial) group reasoning. First, I will create a device for constructing the logical background. This will be done along the lines of (Loui, 1992), <ref> (Vreeswijk, 1993) </ref>, and (Pollock, 1994). 3.1. DEFINITION. <p> There are as many protocols as there are agents. In the literature, one often speaks of a so-called distributed protocol. Our conceptualization of protocol thus fits in with the more general notion of protocols as proposed by (Lynch and Fischer, 1981), (Ladner and Reif, 1986), and <ref> (Burmeister, Haddadi, and Sundermeyer, 1993) </ref>. Each agent runs an open local protocol. An open local protocol consists of a core, the basic protocol, supplemented or altered by amendments. The basic protocol is the starting point for interaction, the `initial communication convention', that may be adapted in due course. <p> A specification of these aspects help to appoint the basic protocol. AD 4.4.1. The treatment of negative queries is relatively simple here. With more a more sophisticated mechanism of defeat, however, these simple conversions are no longer possible - 13 - <ref> (Vreeswijk, 1993) </ref>. A distinction between positive and negative queries is therefore still useful. AD 4.4.1. Care should be taken that circular consultancy is detected and properly dealt with. This can be done by writing a circularity check. <p> This (strong) procedural claim suggests a (weak) rule of procedure, to be used in regulating dispute. Introducing rules as claims is one step further in the theory of open protocol. My current approach does not go that far. [But cf. <ref> (Hage, 1993) </ref> for efforts in these directions.] - 15 - 5.3. An example At this point, the workings of open protocol can best be illustrated with the help of an example. In this example, the open protocol will be altered along the dimension of distributed search.

Reference-contexts: Agents in multi-agent systems perform different activities. These activities include planning, negotiation, deliberation, and decision making. Each activity requires a special protocol. A great deal of effort has been spent in formulating the right protocols for each of these activities. Multi-agent planning protocols, for example, are formulated in <ref> (Durfee and Lesser, 1987) </ref>, (Georgeff, 1987), and (Lansky, 1991). Protocols for negotiation have been proposed in (Davis and Smith, 1983), and (Conry, Meyer, and Lesser, 1986). Decision making protocols have been suggested by (Tenney and Sandell, 1981), and (Stirling, 1992). <p> These activities include planning, negotiation, deliberation, and decision making.

Arguments may be repeatedly defeated an reinstated before reaching their ultimate logical status. It follows that the logical interaction among arguments is a complex phenomenon. In defining which argument, given the facts, are ultimately undefeated, I follow John Pollock <ref> (1987) </ref>. His definition of level-n arguments is a convenient way to do this. 6.1.2.

An argument is in at level n, if it has no defeaters at level n -1. <p> It follows that the logical interaction among arguments is a complex phenomenon.

In the ideal case, the protocol's specification develops out of the context, just like what happens in the organization of social talk <ref> (Taylor and Cameron, 1987) </ref>. We are in a remote position in this respect but, on the other hand, the appearance of specifications emerging out of the context is a current phenomenon for those who engage in genetic programming (Goldberg, 1989), (Koza, 1992).

Reference-contexts: Performance In the literature of computer networks <ref> (Tanenbaum, 1989) </ref> and distributed knowledge based consultancy (Mohan, 1984), a (fixed) protocol is considered to perform well if the flow of the messages between agents is mediated in a fair, effective, and economic way, appropriate to the task considered. <p> In summary, it is assumed that agents follow the basic protocol unconditionally, ad infinitum. If agents follow the basic protocol `wherever it goes', conclusions must be awaited for. Therefore, correct protocols are impractical. Correct protocols are available in low level communication environments <ref> (Tanenbaum, 1989) </ref>, but do not exist in advanced multi-agent systems. This, once again, underlines the need for open protocol. 7. Conclusion In this article, I explored the notion of open protocol in multi-agent systems. <p> We are in a remote position in this respect but, on the other hand, the appearance of specifications emerging out of the context is a current phenomenon for those who engage in genetic programming <ref> (Goldberg, 1989) </ref>, (Koza, 1992). These three characteristics make open protocol to be an important, promising, and challenging subject, a subject that certainly warrants further study and exploration. Acknowledgements.

Promptness is achieved by shallow search, limited consultancy, and quick time-out's. Correct protocols are typically slow; prompt protocols are typically fast. Promptness and correctness are properties that are mutually exclusive. They cannot be achieved within one and the same protocol.
