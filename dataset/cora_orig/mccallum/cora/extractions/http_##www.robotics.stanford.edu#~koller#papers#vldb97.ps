Title: Using Probabilistic Information in Data Integration  
Author: Daniela Florescu Daphne Koller Alon Levy 
Affiliation: AT&T Laboratories  Stanford University  AT&T Laboratories  
Abstract: Thus far, contents of data sources were described qualitatively. We describe the use of quantitative information in the form of probabilistic knowledge in mediator systems. We consider several kinds of probabilistic information: information about overlap between collections in the mediated schema, coverage and completeness of the information sources, and degrees of overlap between information sources. We address the problem of ordering accesses to multiple information sources, in order to maximize the likelihood of obtaining answers as early as possible. We describe a declarative formalism for specifying these kinds of probabilistic information, and we propose algorithms for ordering the information sources. Finally, we discuss a preliminary experimental evaluation of these algorithms on the domain of bibliographic sources available on the WWW.

Reference-contexts: We considered a set of 80 data sources, all of which are bibliography servers found on the WWW (some gleaned from the Glimpse bibliography server <ref> [BDMS94] </ref>). The descriptions of the sources were given manually. We considered two different scenarios w.r.t. source coverages. In the first, we assumed none of the sources give high coverage of their descriptions. In this case, all sources gave coverages of 20%-40% of their description.

Reference-contexts: Hence, we suppose that we have a method for mapping a user query to a schema query (on which we can reason), by mapping each attribute selection to a membership condition. For example, in our implementation we use the SMART information retrieval system <ref> [Buc85] </ref> to map from keywords to topics in our hierarchy.

In contrast, in our work the goal of the probabilistic information is to order the accesses to the information sources in such that we obtain as many answers as possible early on, as opposed to minimizing the cost of answering the query.

Reference-contexts: In our discussion we limited the user queries and schema queries to conjunctions of collections literals and literals specifying the value of an attribute.

The goal of a mediator system is to provide users a uniform interface to the multitude of information sources, and therefore to free the user from having to find the information sources, interact with each one in isolation, and combine manually the information from the sources. <p> In this section we briefly describe the implementation of the algorithms within the Information Manifold system <ref> [LRO96] </ref> and the preliminary experiments showing their utility. The goal of the experiments is to test the relative running times of the different algorithms, and to compare the quality of the orderings they produce w.r.t. the optimal ordering. Our experiment considered the domain of Computer Science publications.

Reference-contexts: In order not to require the specification of an exponential number of probabilities, we limited the kinds of source overlap information that we can provide. We are currently considering an extension based on Bayesian networks <ref> [Pea88] </ref>. Informally, the advantage of Bayesian networks is that they cut down drastically the number of joint probabilities that need to be specified, while still providing a unique and complete probability distribution.
