Abstract: If I believe, as I do, that the Loch Ness monster does not exist, then my having that belief is one thing; the nonexistence of the monster (or otherwise) is, of course, another. If I fear, as I do, that war will break out in Europe during the next decade, then my having that fear is one thing; the occurrence of such a cataclysm (or otherwise) is another. So it is with all of the so-called propositional attitudes. Whenever I believe or doubt or fear or desire, there we have two things: on the one hand, my believing or doubting or fearing or desiring; on the other, that state of affairs which, in having these thoughts, I thereby represent to myself. Question: what, in general, can we say about the relationship between the two? The problem, known to contemporary philosophy as the problem of intentionality, is to provide an account of the relationship which holds between a state of affairs P , and the state of affairs in which a person entertains a given attitude (typically, belief) towards P . It is widely accepted, among naturalistically-minded philosophers, that a solution can be given which is at once general, succinct and non-trivial. By general, I mean an account that works for all possible states of affairs that one may believe: what we seek is a schema that will produce, for any given state of affairs P , a specification of what it means to believe P . By succinct, I mean an account which generates these specifications in a principled way: it would hardly constitute an explanation of the propositional attitudes to compile a titanic, perhaps infinite, listing containing a separate entry for each possible content P . By non-trivial, I mean an account couched in terms devoid of intentional (or semantic) idiom: if there are any facts about representation, those facts must surely be identifiable within a physicalistic scheme which does not number irreducible psychological (or linguistic) properties among its basic categories. For ease of reference, I shall speak of an account satisfying these criteria| generality, succincness and non-triviality|as an analysis of the attitudes.
