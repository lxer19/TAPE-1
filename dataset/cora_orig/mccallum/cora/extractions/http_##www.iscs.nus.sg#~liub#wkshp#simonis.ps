Reference-contexts: In general it is possible to look at the bin-packing relaxation of the scheduling problem to obtain another lower bound. In this note we discuss yet another lower bound which can be obtained by using the cumulative constraint <ref> [AB93] </ref> in CHIP [DHS88] [VSD92] [FHK92] [JM94]. This bound often gives better results than the first two obvious methods, and is influenced by constraints on time periods. The different lower bounds are obtained from the original problem by selectively relaxing some aspect of the constraints. <p> A more detailed description is found in <ref> [AB93] </ref>. The first parameter is the list of start dates, the second parameter is the list of durations, the third parameter is a list of resource use, which is set to 1 for each task in our case. <p> The mathematical background of this problem can be found for example in [CL91] [MT90]. With CHIP, we can express the bin packing problem with a cumulative constraint <ref> [AB93] </ref> [BDP94]. The x-axis on this constraint will be the bin number, the y-axis (the cumulative resource) will be the time. Each task is represented by a rectangle with length 1 and height Duration, which starts at location Bin.

Reference-contexts: The actual number of drivers required by the full problem solver will be typically 10% larger than the lower bound. This is not surprising since other constraints like location continuity and passive transport [Sim95] [Sim95a] <ref> [BKC94] </ref> cause the use of additional resources. The lower bound is used in two ways.

Reference-contexts: We assume that the length of the work period of any resource is restricted to a maximal value called W. 3.1 Constraint expression We will now first explain how the problem itself can be expressed in CHIP. This model is based on variants of the diffn <ref> [BC94] </ref> constraint. We describe tasks with a tuple of domain variables Start Duration Resource which have appropriate initial domains. 3.1.1 Assignment Problem The resource constraint will be expressed with a 2-dimensional diffn constraint, where the x-dimension denotes time and the y-dimension denotes the resource assignment. <p> In our 2-dimensional case, we have to give the four values x- and y-starting point, length and height. The remaining five arguments of the diffn constraint allow to express additional constraint, which are explained in <ref> [BC94] </ref>. 3.1.2 Work periods We will now use one of the additional parameters, the region constraints [BC94], to implement the work period limits. For the region constraints we give a set of rectangles which constitute the regions on which we express some constraints. <p> The remaining five arguments of the diffn constraint allow to express additional constraint, which are explained in <ref> [BC94] </ref>. 3.1.2 Work periods We will now use one of the additional parameters, the region constraints [BC94], to implement the work period limits. For the region constraints we give a set of rectangles which constitute the regions on which we express some constraints. For each region, we also give a projection dimension and a domain variable which is constrained. The region constraints work as follows. <p> This means that the value calculated by the region constraint is the range between the first and the last use of the resource by any task. This is just the work period as we have defined it above. of the constraint is given in <ref> [BC94] </ref>. Task Rn R1 Duration (Start, Resource) height 1 time resources By limiting the domain of the range variable, we enforce a limit on the working period for each resource.

Reference-contexts: This application combines planning, scheduling and assignment aspects of the operational fleet management in the food industry. The scheduling problem is concerned with assigning drivers and lorries to a number of trips between different locations. These trips are nearly fixed in time by producer/consumer constraints <ref> [SC94] </ref> on the arrival times at the destination sites. The start times can therefore only be changed in a very limited way. We have to assign lorries, drivers and other resources to the trips in order to satisfy a large number of different constraints.

Reference-contexts: The different lower bounds are obtained from the original problem by selectively relaxing some aspect of the constraints. We briefly discuss this taxonomy of lower bounds. We then present an application of the method to a real-life scheduling/assignment problem. In the TACT <ref> [Sim95b] </ref> system, the lower bound is used to estimate the number of drivers required in a transportation problem. <p> Application Example We now show how these lower bounds can be used in a real-life context of the TACT <ref> [Sim95b] </ref> project. This application combines planning, scheduling and assignment aspects of the operational fleet management in the food industry.
