Abstract: RelAtive SpecTral Analysis Perceptual Linear Prediction (RASTA-PLP) is the standard speech feature extraction method used at the International Computer Science Institute. There it has been used primarily in conjunction with a hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) speech recognition system. This work explores the viability of the RASTA-PLP as a candidate feature extraction method in the Siemens ZT recognition system. Experiments with a basic RASTA-PLP setup confirm that it provides good performance and is a potentially useful tool which merits further research and experimentation.

Reference-contexts: The MEL processing on the other hand did include spectral mean subtraction and this contributes to yet another difference between the results in this report. This difference is absent with respect to the MFCC. A more detailed description of the RASTA-PLP processing can be found in <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. It is worth noting that the delta calculations were also different between the RASTA-PLP and MEL calculated features. RASTA-PLP deltas were calculated using a linear regression over a 9 frame window.
