Abstract: This paper investigates memory issues that influence long- term creative problem solving and design activity, taking a case-based reasoning perspective. Our exploration is based on a well-documented example: the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell. We abstract Bell's reasoning and understanding mechanisms that appear time and again in long-term creative design. We identify that the understanding mechanism is responsible for analogical anticipation of design constraints and analogical evaluation, beside case-based design. But an already understood design can satisfy opportunistically suspended design problems, still active in background. The new mechanisms are integrated in a computational model, ALEC 1 , that accounts for some creative be

Reference-contexts: A matcher is responsible for identifying the best candidate to be adapted. The differences between the design specification and the best retrieved candidate may be used to perform case-based adaptation (Bhatta and Goel <ref> [1] </ref>). But if the existing differences cannot be reduced in one step, planning a sequence of adaptation steps might be necessary. Finally, the adapted candidate artifact is sent to the Evaluation process. <p> Our analysis of Bell's diaries suggest that this reliance on previous experience can be abstracted as an understanding subprocess involving both retrieval and analogical reasoning (Moorman and Ram [12], Bhatta and Goel <ref> [1] </ref>). While analogical reasoning has been used traditionally only by the Design Alternatives process, our contribution is to extend the use of analogical reasoning to the other processes in our framework, namely Evaluation and Design Specification.

Reference-contexts: We realized that understanding is a memory issue that should play a more important role in our framework for creative design. 2 Creative Design 2.1 Issues The task of a designer is to specify the structure of an artifact that delivers some functions and satisfies some constraints (see Chandrasekaran <ref> [2] </ref>). Creative design adds two supplementary constraints: the designed artifact should be both novel and useful. But this simplistic characterization of the creative design task provides no clues in the processes involved. <p> In Bell's case, he generated the telephone idea while working on the multiple telegraph. Once a designer has an initial design specification worth pursuing, he might generate and develop alternative design solutions. The most common methods for design use three subtasks: propose, critique, and modify (Chandrasekaran <ref> [2] </ref>). The issue here is how to implement these subtasks to explain creative behavior.

Reference-contexts: The set of Suspended Problems is characterized by non-elaborated design specifications (sketchy-specs), which cannot be understood successfully by ALEC. A suspended problem can be elaborated further when a matching algorithm (For- bus, Ferguson and Gentner <ref> [3] </ref>) recognizes opportunistically that something in the environment or created on the fly fulfills the requirements formulated in a sketchy-spec. The set of Background Artifacts contains artifacts accessed recently, including design alternatives associated with Suspended Problems. <p> If WM or LTM matching was successful, the third step (3) performs analogical transfer between the retrieved artifact and the current Evolving Specification. If retrieval failed (4), the algorithm attempts to relax the most specific design constraints to facilitate analogical reasoning ( Forbus, Ferguson and Gentner <ref> [3] </ref>) and iterates step (1). Otherwise (5), the current problem context is suspended in WM (in Suspended Problems) and in LTM, by predictively encoding (Hammond et al. [7]) it in terms of its specification.

Reference-contexts: But if the existing differences cannot be reduced in one step, planning a sequence of adaptation steps might be necessary. Finally, the adapted candidate artifact is sent to the Evaluation process. Given a structural description of an artifact, the Evaluation process performs a qualitative simulation (Forbus <ref> [4] </ref>) to validate the design, if it has the prerequisite knowledge. Otherwise, evaluation by experimentation is performed. The Evaluation process may suggest new constraints to the Design Specification and Design Alternatives processes. 2.4 Understanding All of the reasoning processes in our framework (see Fig. 1) rely on previous case-based experience.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper investigates memory mechanisms that influence long-term creative problem solving and design activity, from a case-based reasoning (CBR) (Kolod- ner [10]) perspective, by integrating elements of model-based reasoning (Goel <ref> [5] </ref>). Our exploration is based on a well documented example: the invention of the telephone (Notebooks 2 ; US v. Bell [19]; Gorman [6]). <p> In order to teach a lesson, a design case may be understood in terms of a more or less detailed causal model, by representing explicitly structural and behavioral relations (Goel <ref> [5] </ref>). In fact a reasoner can associate several causal models (e.g., acoustical, electrical) with a known case, by using analogical understanding. The behavioral relations are essential also for representing evolving design specifications, used to retrieve and reason about known artifacts. <p> Fig. 2. Matching Helmholtz's Apparatus and Bell's Speech Model represent predictive features of the artifact (our framework relies on functional indexing; see Goel <ref> [5] </ref>). The structural relations (configurations) associated with a known artifact represent important indexes for perceiving (Hinrichs [9]) and recognizing topological structures, while understanding a new design. As an example, Fig. 2 shows a simplified case representation of Helmholtz Apparatus and of Bell's model for (human) speech production.

Reference-contexts: Our exploration is based on a well documented example: the invention of the telephone (Notebooks 2 ; US v. Bell [19]; Gorman <ref> [6] </ref>). Retrospectively, the obvious question related to the invention of the telephone is: what cognitive issues "delayed" the invention of the telephone till 1876? The basic principles of the telephone, electromagnetism and induction, had been known since 1831.

Reference-contexts: Any new constraint inferred may remind the reasoner another configuration, so the above mechanism is iterative. Also, the Evaluation process may provide at any moment extra constraints derived through simulation and experimentation. The Design Specification process extends the functionality of the anticipator module in Chef (Hammond et al. <ref> [7] </ref>). The specification designed by the Design Specification module is sent to the Design Alternatives process. Given an updated design specification, the Design Alternatives process tries to retrieve known devices which satisfy the set of design constraints (which may include relations among the constraints). <p> Otherwise (5), the current problem context is suspended in WM (in Suspended Problems) and in LTM, by predictively encoding (Hammond et al. <ref> [7] </ref>) it in terms of its specification. We notice that any of the Suspended Problems is exhaustively encoded in WM, since the whole representation of its Alternatives is available for matching.

Reference-contexts: New opportunities can be created by the External Recognizer (exogenous opportunities) or by other internal process (endogenous opportunities). The control of our computational model is explicit, namely selection of opportunities from the agenda by using a control plan (Hayes-Roth <ref> [8] </ref>). 3.2 Processing Algorithms Creative design usually evolves incrementally, during several design sessions. During each session, ALEC addresses some old issues/problems and it may raise other subproblems (see Figure 4a). Our view of creative design includes two concurrent processes: one evolving Design Alternatives and another one evolving Design Specification.

This means that the Design Specification provides an analog-ical anticipator of constraints.

Reference-contexts: When Bell identified an unexpected function of a device, he tried to understand it in terms of his knowledge. When his understanding process failed, he generated new learning goals (Ram and Hunter <ref> [15] </ref>). But Bell brought a new perspective to the analysis of telephony by relying on his acoustical knowledge to generate new hypotheses. In analogy with acoustical sound transmission, Bell generated the electrical "undulatory current" hypothesis, essential for the design of the telephone.

WM represents the activated part of LTM and keeps track of recent reasoning contexts.

Reference-contexts: A novel artifact implies a novel design specification and it is difficult to separate the evolution of the design solution from the evolution of the design specification. The evolution of the design specification can be viewed as another design process (Tong <ref> [21] </ref>) from an incomplete, contradictory and underconstrained specification to a better description, good enough for designing a novel artifact.
