Title: A Traffic Model for MPEG-Coded VBR Streams

Abstract: Compression of digital video is the only viable means to transport real-time full-motion video over BISDN/ATM networks. Traffic streams generated by video compressors exhibit complicated patterns which vary from one compression scheme to another. In this paper we investigate the traffic characteristics of video streams which are compressed based on the MPEG standard. Our study is based on 23 minutes of video obtained from an entertainment movie. A particular significance of our data is that it contains all types of coded frames, namely: Intra-coded (I), Prediction (P), and Bidirectional (B) MPEG frames. We describe the statistical behavior of the VBR stream using histograms and autocorrelation functions. A procedure is developed to determine the instants of a scene change based on the changes in the size of successive I frames. It is found that the length of a scene can be modeled by a geometric distribution. A model for an MPEG traffic source is developed in which frames are generated according to the compression pattern of the captured video stream. For each frame type, the number of cells per frame is fitted by a lognormal distribution whose parameters are determined by the frame type. The appropriateness and limitations of the model are examined by studying the multiplexing performance of MPEG streams. Simulations of an ATM multiplexer are conducted, in which traffic sources are derived from the measured VBR trace as well as the proposed model. The queueing performance in both cases is found to be relatively close.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the output of a video codec is a VBR stream. Unlike conventional data networks, ATM networks provide efficient support for VBR traffic. The focus of this paper is on a particular compression algorithm which has recently gained considerable attention, namely the Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) standard (see <ref> [1] </ref> for an overview of MPEG). Among other compression standards, MPEG is being the focus of our study for two reasons: (1) it has been standardized by CCITT and (2) it involves several types of compression that are also used by other compression algorithms. <p> Frames can be coded as I, P, or B frames (intra-frame, predictive, or bidirectional, respectively). Frames of type I are compressed used DCT only, while B and P frames involve motion compensation (prediction and interpolation) as well. Details of the MPEG standard can be found elsewhere (see <ref> [1] </ref>). The compression pattern used to encode the examined video stream is shown in Figure 1. 3 Statistical Characteristics of MPEG Streams 3.1 Frame Size Measurements Based on the previous setup, 41760 video frames were compressed and their sizes were recorded.

Reference-contexts: Correlations arise naturally in compressed video traffic and their patterns are largely determined by the type of video (e.g., videophone, motion-picture, teleconferencing) as well as by the compression algorithm used. In <ref> [2] </ref> the authors proposed two traffic models for the frame-size sequence of a video-phone stream compressed using a conditional replenishment algorithm. The first model is a first-order autoregressive process, while the second is a fluid model. <p> Inter-frame correlations are observed when the VBR stream is studied at the frame level, as in the case of our study. In several previous studies of video traffic, researchers observed that the autocorrelation function for the framesize sequence of the examined compressed video stream has a negative-exponential shape <ref> [2, 18, 6, 9] </ref>. A different shape of this function should be expected in MPEG-coded streams. The reason is that MPEG defines three different types of frames which are generated according to a compression pattern. The compression pattern is repeated until all the frames in the stream are compressed.

In order to obtain multiple streams for the trace-driven simulations, we assume that the frame-size sequence of the measured VBR stream constitute a homogeneous stochastic process. Following the approach of Heyman et al. <ref> [6] </ref>, the measured trace is arranged as a circular list by connecting its ends. To obtain each of the multiplexed streams in the trace-driven simulations, a starting frame is randomly selected from the circular list. Thereafter, the remaining frames are selected sequentially following the starting frame.

Reference-contexts: The main objective of this paper is to develop a traffic model for an MPEG-coded video stream. Several traffic models have been proposed to characterize compressed video streams [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] (also see <ref> [14] </ref> for a survey). The parameters of these models were obtained by matching certain statistical characteristics of an actual video sequence and the model under consideration.

At a 95% level of confidence, the hypoth esis of independence cannot be rejected. 3.3 The Autocorrelation Structure Correlations in video data arise as a consequence of visual similarities between consecutive images (or parts of images) in a video stream.
