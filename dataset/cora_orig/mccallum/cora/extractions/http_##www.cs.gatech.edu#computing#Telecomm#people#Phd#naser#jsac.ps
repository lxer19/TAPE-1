Title: Supporting Real Time VBR Video Using Adaptive Linear Prediction

Abstract: A dynamic bandwidth allocation strategy to support variable bit rate (VBR) video traffic is proposed. This strategy predicts the bandwidth requirements for future frames using adaptive linear prediction that minimizes the mean square error. The adaptive technique does not require any prior knowledge of the traffic statistics, nor assumes stationarity. Several reservation schemes are also presented. Analysis using six one-half hour video traces indicate that prediction errors for the bandwidth required for the next frames are almost white noise or short memory. By reserving bandwidth equal to the predicted value, only the prediction errors need to be buffered. Because the errors are almost white noise or short memory, small buffer size, high utilization, and small delay are achieved. Simulation results for dynamic reservation based on predicting 1-frame and predicting 12-frames are presented. The results for 12-frames show that the queue size is reduced by a factor between 15-160 and the network utilization is increased between 190%-300% as compared to a fixed service rate.

Reference-contexts: Long-range dependent processes can be represented by an autoregressive (AR) process with infinite order [14]. Therefore, to approximate a long range dependent process with an AR process, as the size of the realization of the process increases, the order of the AR process should be increased <ref> [2] </ref>. The effect of increasing the size of the VBR trace on the mean square error is studied as follows: (1) the first half of the trace is forecasted and the order of the filter is obtained; (2) the same filter order is used on the entire trace.

Reference-contexts: Also, it appears that the filter coefficients used for prediction emphasize the more recent value. This is especially true for the I frames. Thus, one may model the I frame subsequence as a non-stationary autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) with a difference d equal to one <ref> [3] </ref>. Enhanced DBW Allocation using Forecast Errors An enhancement to the dynamic bandwidth allocation based on prediction may be achieved by using the knowledge of previous errors to enhance the reservation.

The LMS is an adaptive approach. It does not require prior knowledge of the auto-correlation structure of a sequence. Therefore, it can be used as an on-line algorithm for forecasting bandwidth.

The simplest estimate is the one point sample average e (n)x (n). * Update w (n) by taking a step of size 0:5 in the negative gradient direction. This will point to the bottom of the error surface (see <ref> [8] </ref>). The update equation for LMS filter coefficients is given by: w (n + 1) = w (n) 0:5r~ (5) If x (n) is stationary, w (n) converges in the mean to the optimal solution R x w = P [7, 8]. <p> The update equation for LMS filter coefficients is given by: w (n + 1) = w (n) 0:5r~ (5) If x (n) is stationary, w (n) converges in the mean to the optimal solution R x w = P <ref> [7, 8] </ref>.

If 0 &lt; &lt; 2, then NLMS will converge in the mean <ref> [8] </ref>. Using large results in a faster convergence and quicker response to signal changes. However, after convergence, the prediction coefficients will have large fluctuations. On the other hand using small results in slower convergence and less fluctuation after convergence, i.e., there is a trade off.

Two scenarios were studied through the simulation: (1) fixed service rate and (2) dynamic service rate based on NLMS prediction.

The sequences represent a wide range of video applications, and encoded according to the MPEG-I standard. MPEG-I has three frame types: I, P, and B. <p> The encoder uses a periodic frame pattern which is called a Group of Pictures (GOP). The GOP pattern used for the video sequences was IBBPBBPBBPBB. For more details about the encoder parameters see <ref> [17] </ref>. Table 1 shows the video traces, their mean, and maximum frame sizes. The traces were used to test the forecast methods. Since I, P, and B frame types have different statistical characteristics, we separate them and forecast each frame type separately.
