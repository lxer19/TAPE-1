Abstract: Recent research in analogy, metaphor and retrieval in case-based systems has suggested the need to integrate a re-description capability with the creation of mappings. In this paper, we argue that there is also a need for systems that adapt knowledge for reuse to integrate re-description into the process of adaptation. We describe a system called INA which does this while solving geometric proportional analogies. We then discuss the properties a system must have in order to integrate re-description and adaptation. Finally, we compare our work with some other related approaches.

Reference-contexts: Introduction In recent years, several subfields of artificial intelligence have addressed the problem of adapting knowledge for reuse. The field of case-based reasoning <ref> (Aamodt & Plaza 1994) </ref> is based on the idea that computers can solve problems by storing successful solutions to past problems and then retrieving an old solution previously stored and applying it to some new problem.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the system returns two mappings M , M 0 which respectively map a's description to c's description, b's description to d's and a t-mapping TM which maps transformation T to T 0 . The INA Architecture INA has a blackboard-style architecture <ref> (Engelmore & Morgan 1988) </ref> which is illustrated in Fig. 4. The preprocessor shown at the bottom of Fig. 4 is invoked once at the beginning of a run and transforms each set of line segments representing figures a, b and c into a new normalized set of line segments.

Reference-contexts: Typically, the old solution does not fit the new problem exactly and must be adapted to fit the requirements of the new problem. In the related field of analogical reasoning, a similar framework has been worked out <ref> (Hall 1989) </ref> where, given a target description, a source is retrieved and then a mapping is made from the source to the target possibly extending the target description.

Reference-contexts: Mapping in analogical reasoning has, until recently, been studied with the tacit assumption that there exists a description-building module that somehow creates the descriptions of the source and the target domains and which then remain fixed during the mapping process <ref> (Hofstadter 1995, Chap. 4) </ref>. Let us call this assumption and its variants in other domains: the description module assumption.
