Title: Very large conferences on the Internet: the Internet Multimedia Conferencing Architecture.  
Author: M. Handley, J. Crowcroft, C. Bormann and J. Ott 
Affiliation: Information Sciences Institute, Dept of Computer Science, Informatics Dept, University of Southern California, University College London, University of Bremen  
Abstract: In this paper we provide an overview of multimedia conferencing on the Internet. The protocols mentioned are all specified elsewhere as internet-drafts or RFCs. Each RFC gives details of the protocol itself, how it works and what it does. This document attempts to provide the reader with an overview of how the components fit together and of some of the assumptions made, as well as some statement of direction for those components still in a nascent stage.

Reference-contexts: This does not mean that best-effort service cannot support real-time traffic merely that congested best-effort links seriously degrade the service provided. For such congested links, a better-than-best-effort service is desirable. 2 For slow links, a set of mechanisms has been defined that helps minimize serialisation and link access delays <ref> [2] </ref> 4 To achieve this, the service model of the routers can be modified. FIFO queuing can be replaced by packet forwarding strategies that discriminate different flows of traffic. The idea of a flow is very general.

Reference-contexts: Such certification mechanisms <ref> [3] </ref> are however not specific to conferencing, and it looks likely that certificates such as those provided by PGP will be most widely used in the near term. Session keys can be distributed using encrypted Session Descriptions carried in SIP session invitations, or in encrypted session announcements as described below.

Reference-contexts: A client can specify that an RTSP server plays a recorded multimedia session into an existing multicast-based conference, or can specify that the server should join the conference and record it. 6.2 Protocols for Non-A/V Applications Applications other than audio and video have evolved in Internet conferencing, e.g. Imm <ref> [4] </ref>, Wb [9], NTE [10]. Such applications can be used to substitute for meeting aids in physical conferences (whiteboards, projectors) or replace visual and auditory cues that are lost in teleconferences (e.g., a speaker list application); they also can enable new 10 styles of joint work.

Reference-contexts: In fact, this is not the case except with broadcast and prune type multicast routing protocols <ref> [5] </ref>. However, IP multicast does make it simple for a host to anonymously join a multi-cast group and receive traffic destined to that group without the other senders' and receivers' knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Routing (unicast and multicast) and group membership protocols <ref> [6] </ref> can do just that. However, this is not the best way of managing applications of which there is more than one instance at any one time.

Reference-contexts: To see why this might be the case, examine the IP multicast service model, as described by Van Jacobson <ref> [9] </ref>: * Senders just send to the group * Receivers express an interest in receiving data sent to the group * Routers conspire to deliver data from senders to receivers 2 With IP multicast, the group is indirectly identified by a single IP class-D multicast address. <p> Imm [4], Wb <ref> [9] </ref>, NTE [10]. Such applications can be used to substitute for meeting aids in physical conferences (whiteboards, projectors) or replace visual and auditory cues that are lost in teleconferences (e.g., a speaker list application); they also can enable new 10 styles of joint work.

Reference-contexts: This broadcasts session descriptions <ref> [11] </ref> to all the potential session participants. These session descriptions provide an advertisement that the session will exist, and also provide sufficient information including multicast addresses, ports, media formats and session times so that a receiver of the session description can join the session.

Reference-contexts: Multicast address allocation is currently an active area of research. For many years multicast address allocation has been performed using mul-ticast session directories (section 7.1), but as the users and uses of IP multicast increase, it is becoming clear that a more hierarchical approach is required. An architecture <ref> [13] </ref> is currently being developed based around a well-defined API that an application can use to request an address. The host then requests an address from a local address allocation server, which in turn chooses and reserves an unallocated address from a range dynamically allocated to the domain.

Reference-contexts: Real-time traffic does not cope terribly well with packet loss levels of more than a few percent, although it is possible to add redundancy <ref> [14] </ref> to increase the levels at which loss becomes a problem.

Reference-contexts: Some applications can make use of added bandwidth/react to congestion in an elastic way, others transport data that, although not strictly real-time, is time-critical. In the IRTF research group on Reliable Multicast <ref> [15] </ref>, work is in progress on common protocol elements that can be used in such applications. At the time of writing, some aspects of reliable multicast are not well-understood, such as the proper way to provide congestion control in a mul-ticast environment.

Reference-contexts: This paper is about the architecture for this latter application in an Internet environment. There are other infrastructures for conferencing in the world: POTS (Plain Old Telephone System) networks often provide voice conferencing and phone-bridges, while ISDN provides H.320 <ref> [16] </ref> for small, strictly organised video-telephony conferencing. The architecture that has evolved in the In 1 ternet is far more general as well as being scalable to very large groups, and permits the open introduction of new media and new applications as they are devised.

Reference-contexts: The most widely used tightly coupled conference control protocols suitable for Internet use are those belonging to the ITU's H.323 family <ref> [17] </ref>. However it should be noted that this is inappropriate for large sessions where scaling problems will be introduced by the conference control mechanisms. <p> These are session advertisement and session invitation. Session advertisements are provided using a session directory, and inviting a user to join a session is provided using a session invitation protocol such as SIP [12][26] or H.323 <ref> [17] </ref>. 7.1 Session Directories The rendezvous mechanism for many light-weight sessions is a multicast based session directory. This broadcasts session descriptions [11] to all the potential session participants.

Reference-contexts: If this is not done, de-synchronised experiments by different receivers will have the net effect that too many layers are always being drawn through a common bottleneck. RLM <ref> [20] </ref> is one way that this might be achieved, although there is continuing research in this area. 6 Conference Control Conferences come in many shapes and sizes, but there are only really two models for conference control: light-weight sessions and tightly coupled conferencing. For both models, rendezvous mechanisms are needed.

Reference-contexts: How then can a single multicast source satisfy a large and heterogeneous set of receivers? In addition to each receiver performing its own adaptation to jitter, if the sender layers <ref> [21] </ref> its video (or audio) stream, different receivers can choose to receive different amounts of traffic and hence different qualities.

Reference-contexts: If the application requirement (conference policy) is to communicate between some defined set of users, then strict privacy can only be enforced in any case through adequate end-to-end encryption. RTP specifies a standard way to encrypt RTP and RTCP packets using private key encryption schemes such as DES <ref> [23] </ref>. It also specifies a standard mechanism to manipulate plain text keys using MD5 [24] so that the resulting bit string can be used as a DES key.

Reference-contexts: RTP specifies a standard way to encrypt RTP and RTCP packets using private key encryption schemes such as DES [23]. It also specifies a standard mechanism to manipulate plain text keys using MD5 <ref> [24] </ref> so that the resulting bit string can be used as a DES key. This allows simple out-of-band mechanisms such as privacy-enhanced mail to be used for encryption key exchange. 8.1 Authentication and Key Distribution Key distribution is closely tied to authentication.

Reference-contexts: This requires that the time base of different flows from the same sender can be related at the receivers, e.g. by making available the times at which each of them was captured relative to a common clock. 5.2 RTP The transport protocol for real-time flows is RTP <ref> [27] </ref>. This provides a standard format packet header which gives media specific timestamp data, as well as payload format information and sequence numbering amongst other things. RTP is normally carried using UDP. It does not provide or require any connection setup, nor does it provide any enhanced reliability over UDP.

Reference-contexts: By allocating addresses in a hierarchical and topologically sensitive fashion, the address itself can be used in a hierarchical mul-ticast routing protocol currently being developed (BGMP, <ref> [29] </ref>) that will help multicast routing scale more gracefully than current schemes. 4 Internet Service Models Traditionally the internet has provided so-called best-effort delivery of datagram traffic from senders to receivers.
