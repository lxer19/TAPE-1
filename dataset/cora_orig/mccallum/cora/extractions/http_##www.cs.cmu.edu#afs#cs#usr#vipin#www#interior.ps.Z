Abstract: Successive Quadratic Programming (SQP) has been the method of choice for the solution of nonlinear programming problems. For the solution of large problems with SQP based codes, the combinatorial complexity associated with active set methods for the treatment of inequalities has been a bottleneck in exploiting the problem structure. In this paper, we examine the merits of incorporating an interior point method within an SQP framework and the significant computational savings are demonstrated on problems drawn from optimal control. We also provide a novel intepretation of the popularly used predictor-corrector interior point method using the principles of reduced Hessian SQP (rSQP).

Reference-contexts: One important benefit for SQP is its ability to be modified in order to take advantage of a particular problem structure. This is especially important for large, sparse systems that include problems in parameter estimation <ref> [1] </ref>, multiperiod optimization and model predictive control. However, one hurdle in exploiting the problem structure is an efficient strategy for treating inequality constraints in the QP subproblem.

Reference-contexts: The first is an optimal control problem which demonstrates that the number of iterations in interior point and active set methods could differ by orders of magnitude for a large number of time steps. The second example is the Tennessee Eastman challenge problem <ref> [4] </ref>. An important aspect of optimal control and dynamic optimization problems that causes difficulties is the presence of inequality constraints. Inequalities in these problems arise from safety considerations as well as physical limitations upon the control input. <p> It was the goal of this example to investigate the viability of using interior point techniques for a simultaneous approach to solving the nonlinear optimal control problem. The Tennessee Eastman challenge problem was originally presented by Downs and Vogel <ref> [4] </ref>. In this paper the authors describe the process, present a black box simulator, and purposely gave no model. The model of the Tennessee Eastman Plant used in this example was taken from the work of Ricker and Lee [9].

Reference-contexts: This approach is demonstrated on a wide range of structured optimization problems between 10000 and 100000 variables. Applications are drawn from optimal control and nonlinear model predictive control for the Ten-nessee Eastman problem. DEVELOPMENTS IN INTERIOR POINT METHODS Ever since the publication of the landmark paper by Karmarkar <ref> [5] </ref> in 1984, interior point methods have been an active research area in the optimization community. The 1990s have seen the emergence of primal dual methods as an important class of interior point algorithms from a computational as well as a theoretical standpoint.

Reference-contexts: To develop this approach, we incorporate the characteristics of the well studied Mehrotra <ref> [7] </ref> predictor-corrector method, which is a path following algorithm within an SQP framework for the solution of nonlinear programming problems. The method could be used in a full space or reduced space for solving large QP problems. <p> We would like to integrate the interior point method and SQP in such a way that we still retain fast linear performance as well as the structured decomposition. To develop this approach, we apply certain characteristics of the well studied Mehrotra <ref> [7] </ref> predictor-corrector algorithm. Each Mehrotra iterate solves an affine scaling predictor step (14) and a corrector step INTERIOR POINT SQP FOR STRUCTURED PROCESS OPTIMIZATION (15) alternately. r 1 ; r 2 ; r 3 are the residuals of the equations at the current point. <p> We expect the strong theoretical and superlinear convergence properties which have been developed for SQP methods to apply in this case as well and are currently researching this. We will henceforth refer to this framework as ISQP. A comparison of this approach to that of Mehrotra <ref> [7] </ref> for the solution of LPs and Linear Complementarity Problems (LCPs) would be of interest. Mehrotra's approach is two-pronged as explained at the beginning of this section. It does not consider the centering term k e in the predictor step.
