Abstract: For many practical problem domains the use of neural networks has led to very satisfactory results. Nevertheless the choice of an appropriate, problem specific network architecture still remains a very poorly understood task. Given an actual problem, one can choose a few different architectures, train the chosen architectures a few times and finally select the architecture with the best behaviour. But, of course, there may exist totally different and much more suited topologies. In this paper we present a genetic algorithm driven network generator that evolves neural feedforward network architectures for specific problems. Our system ENZO 1 optimizes both the network topology and the connection weights at the same time, thereby saving an order of magnitude in necessary learning time. Together with our new concept to solve the crucial neural network problem of permuted internal representations this approach provides an efficient and successfull crossover operator. This makes ENZO very appropriate to manage the large networks needed in application oriented domains. In experiments with three different applications our system generated very successful networks. The generated topologies possess distinct improvements referring to network size, learning time, and generalization ability.

Reference-contexts: Our network generator ENZO represents such a system, that has been successfully employed to accomplish the needs of different tasks. Using ENZO we tested our algorithm with three different applications: (1) a pattern recognition problem, (2) the emulation of the kinematics of a backing up truck derived from <ref> [1] </ref>, and (3) the endgame of the two-player game Nine Men's Morris [2], employing a (23-12-10-10)-topology, a (3-20-3)-topology and a (120-60-20-2-1)-topology, respectively. <p> For standard BP we found (examining 6; 000 networks): 6; 000 [nets] 220 [ epochs net ] 21 [perfect nets] 63; 000 [ epochs perfect net ] 2 F BP is another user specified parameter in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. 3 Perfect means no false classification with the given test sets. <p> We found, that the optimum value for the parameter F BP depends very much on the complexity of the given application. Without weight transmission, i.e. F BP = 0, ENZO evolved no perfect network at all. (2) Kinematics of the truck backer-upper Our second application was derived from <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Using ENZO we tested our algorithm with three different applications: (1) a pattern recognition problem, (2) the emulation of the kinematics of a backing up truck derived from [1], and (3) the endgame of the two-player game Nine Men's Morris <ref> [2] </ref>, employing a (23-12-10-10)-topology, a (3-20-3)-topology and a (120-60-20-2-1)-topology, respectively. So at least the last one of them is much more complex than problems considered in publications on comparable topics ([3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]). <p> It shows that the number of training epochs is reduced from 50 at the start to almost constantly 5 epochs in the evolution phase, as a consequence of weight transmission. In order to compare differently trained `Sokrates' nets in <ref> [2] </ref> the authors introduce the average improvement as a measure for the network's playing performance. Besides being used as fitness criterion this measure also allows a comparison between our best evolved net and the handcrafted original `Sokrates' net.
