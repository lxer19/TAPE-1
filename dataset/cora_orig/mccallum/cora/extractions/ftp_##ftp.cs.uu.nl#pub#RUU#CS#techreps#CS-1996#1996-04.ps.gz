Reference-contexts: Systems trying to solve this problem automatically are called information retrieval (IR) systems. These systems which are developed from a defined model try to furnish a solution for the problem. There are various models of IR systems; the most publicized ones are the Boolean, the Vector Space <ref> [1] </ref>, and the Probabilistic models [2, 3]. More recently, van Rijsbergen [4] suggested a model of an IR system based on logic because the use of an adequate logic provides all the necessary concepts to embody the different functions of an IR system.

A diverse range of IR models has emerged based on the way they define aboutness.

Reference-contexts: That is, logic is a formalization of the way we use information in our everyday life to think, infer, conclude, acquire knowledge, make decisions and so forth. In this sense, logic undertakes to model information and its flow. In <ref> [7] </ref>, we discussed the preponderance of the flow of information in IR.

Reference-contexts: Therefore we can conclude that overlap aboutness decisions are not transitive <ref> [8] </ref>. The comparison process as follows: consider strict coordinate level matching, where d is about q if q (d), and the boolean retrieval model, where d is about q if (d) ` q in a classical derivation system extended with the closed world assumption. <p> On the basis of this knowledge we can prove that the recall of a boolean retrieval system is always higher than or equal to that of a strict coordinate level matching system <ref> [8, 30] </ref>. After formulating the set of postulates given an IR model, we can distinguish some basic properties of sets of postulates. One important property, governed by some models and rejected by some other is non-monotonicity.

Reference-contexts: In many domains that relate to information, such as artificial intelligence, databases, linguistics and even philosophy, information is represented by some structure or calculus that is built on the concept of truth. We, on the other hand, following the line of <ref> [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] </ref>, and so forth, advance a logic-based model of IR using a logic of information and its flow. For this reason, we have chosen to use a theory, namely Situation Theory, that is primarily concerned with the representation of information and its flow. <p> For this reason, we have chosen to use a theory, namely Situation Theory, that is primarily concerned with the representation of information and its flow. In this section, we show the appropriateness of Situation Theory to model IR. We base our discussion on the work of Dretske <ref> [14] </ref> who provides a comprehensive dissertation about the role of information and its flow. Indeed, the philosophy behind the development of Situation Theory conforms to many of the points expressed by Dretske. <p> emphasized. 1 In this paper, the term relevance is used in both contexts, with respect to the user (which is the correct use in the IR world) and with respect to the system (indicating good satisfaction). 2 The main concepts in Situation Theory are summarized here: 2 2.1 Signal Dretske <ref> [14] </ref> explains that information is knowledge about a source; it is communicated by a signal to a receiver. In IR, the source is the document and the receiver is anybody observing the document (reading a text, listening to an audiotape or observing an image). <p> A signal can also be the indexing process which delivers a representation of the information content of the document. Dretske <ref> [14] </ref> defines a source as any structure with an information content; situation is of primary concern here. Let d be a situation and ' be an information item. <p> One could compare a (physical) document's information content to a sensory experience, which often embodies a great variety of details. According to Dretske <ref> [14] </ref>, the perception of a sensory experience is the process by which information is delivered to a cognitive agent for its selective use. It is identified with a signal that carries information about a source which is coded in analog form. <p> If s is one of them, this is written s j= '. 3 2.3 Cognition Dretske <ref> [14] </ref> describes cognition as the conversion of the information a cognitive agent receives in analog form into digital form. The result is usually qualified as a knowledge with respect to the cognitive agent. <p> In text documents, the digital information is the information that is made explicit by the indexing process. This information is strongly dependent of the properties of the indexer (the cognitive agent). 2.4 Information vs. meaning Dretske <ref> [14] </ref> claims that information and meaning are two different concepts. Indeed, there is no reason to assume that the information a signal carries is identical to its meaning. Often, the information contained in a signal exceeds its meaning. <p> thesaurus), the question arises whether in this model d is still about q? Some authors argued that IR models should cover this non-monotonic character, as natural aboutness has a non-monotonic property [32, 33, 30]. 4 Conclusions and Further Research From Dretske's account of the role of a theory of information <ref> [14] </ref>, Situation Theory seems the right framework for the qualitative modelling of the IR system. Situations and types show similarities with documents and their information content. Supported information corresponds to the explicit information content (digitalized) of the document, whereas carried information corresponds to its implicit information content.

For this reason, we have chosen to use a theory, namely Situation Theory, that is primarily concerned with the representation of information and its flow. <p> In every day reasoning, people of-ten use background conditions, though they are not aware of them. People often, if asked, cannot express them. This should not imply the non-existence of the background conditions. As Devlin points out <ref> [17] </ref>, background conditions become a concern only when a constraint fails. Similar problems arise in IR. Take the example of a synonym-based constraint. If the term referred to in this constraint is polysemic, disambiguation is necessary to ensure that the constraint can be used. <p> First, there is a characterisation language that digitalise the information in a document. The keyword languages play a pivotal role in the majority of characterisation languages. Items of informations are keywords extract from the document. A set of items is termed an index. Following Devlin <ref> [17] </ref>, we see this item of information as an infon. Using Dretske's terminology, we can see an infon as a digitalized piece of information. Secondly, there is a matching function that determines whether a set of information items is about another set of information items. <p> Indeed, a correct representation of the user (mental) intention certainly generates better retrieval. The attainment of such a representation enters the area of Cognitive Science, some aspects of which can be formally expressed with Situation Theory <ref> [17] </ref>. It also is interesting to note the use of a meta-model for studying uncertainty aspects in IR.

We suggest that aboutness can be viewed as some sort of logical derivation. These logical derivations play an important role both in IR as well as in Situation Theory <ref> [18] </ref>. For instance, consider the extension of situation by union of another situation; can we decide that S [T 2; T for any arbitral situation S and T ? Making this aboutness derivation explicit is the underlying idea of our work.

Reference-contexts: The essence of Situation Theory is to capture these facts, which is often not the case with many others frameworks such as those based on truth (e.g., Classical Logic, Default Theory <ref> [20] </ref>, Modal Logic [21]). In these, every representation of an information item is assessed to either belong or not to belong to the document (the assessment is often a truth value). This is unreasonable because many information items have no connection whatsoever with the information content of the document. <p> However, one can also think about another derivation relation. It is for instance possible to consider a default theory (cf. <ref> [20] </ref>) as a derivation system. In that case the derivation relation is being defined by being an element of an extension; this derivation relation is in general not expressible in the way of the classical logical derivation relation. Generally, this is the case for non-monotonic derivation relations.

In most cases an aboutness-relation can be described by an effectively calculated set of axioms and rules. This is for instance the case for derivation in classical proposition logic, but also for derivation in several modal logics <ref> [21] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A more thorough representation of a document's information content needs the appropriate capturing of the flow of information. This is why frameworks such as Montague Semantics <ref> [22] </ref> are not appropriate, since they are theories of meaning, whereas Situation Theory is a theory of information. 2.5 Flow of information During the indexing process in IR, the information that is digitalized constitutes the document's initial representation, which is not an exhaustive description of the information content of that document.

Reference-contexts: The more uncertain the flow, the less relevant the document. In IR, it is usually insufficient to say that a document is relevant to a query; knowing the extent of relevance is mandatory 3 . In <ref> [25] </ref>, we use the uncertainty engendered by uncertain flow as the basis of a numerical formulation of relevance. We achieved this by mapping a theory of uncertainty on top of Situation Theory.

Reference-contexts: One important property, governed by some models and rejected by some other is non-monotonicity. In the Artificial Intelligence field, the non-monotonic behaviour of rules (in their terminology, known as non-monotonic reasoning) plays an important role. A rather informal definition proposed by ukaszewicz <ref> [31] </ref> clearly presents the idea of this sort of rules. Definition 3.2 (Non-monotonic reasoning (ukaszewicz '90)) By non-monotonic reasoning we understand the drawing of conclusions which may be invalidated in the light of new information. A logical system is called non-monotonic iff its provability relation violates the property of monotonicity.

Reference-contexts: Now, if there is additional information about d (for instance by using a thesaurus), the question arises whether in this model d is still about q? Some authors argued that IR models should cover this non-monotonic character, as natural aboutness has a non-monotonic property <ref> [32, 33, 30] </ref>. 4 Conclusions and Further Research From Dretske's account of the role of a theory of information [14], Situation Theory seems the right framework for the qualitative modelling of the IR system. Situations and types show similarities with documents and their information content.

Reference-contexts: The attainment of such a representation enters the area of Cognitive Science, some aspects of which can be formally expressed with Situation Theory [17]. It also is interesting to note the use of a meta-model for studying uncertainty aspects in IR. Applying the method as proposed in <ref> [34] </ref> in our framework, it is possible to model relevance degrees at the deduction level of the underlying logic, in order to have them explicitly rest on preferential ground.
