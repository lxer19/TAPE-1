Abstract: Most application-level data units are too large to be carried in a single packet (or cell) and must be segmented for network delivery. To an application, the end-to-end delays and loss rate of its data units are much more relevant performance measures than ones specified for individual packets (or cells). The concept of a burst (or block) was introduced to represent a sequence of packets (or cells) that carry an application data unit. In this paper, we describe how a real-time VBR service, with QoS parameters for block transfer delay and block loss rate, can be provided by integrating concepts and delay guarantee results from our previous work on burst scheduling, together with ideas from ATM block transfer. Two new contributions are presented herein. First, we design an admission control algorithm to provide the following classes of service: bounded-delay block transfer with no loss, and bounded-delay block transfer at a specified block loss rate. Second, we show how to extend existing end-to-end delay bounds to networks with hierarchical link sharing.

Reference-contexts: The switch's packet scheduling algorithm plays an important role in controlling such link sharing. Hierarchical link sharing has been proposed as a solution <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> We also assume that an appropriate scheduling algorithm (such as WF 2 Q+ <ref> [1] </ref>) is used by the link to provide a firewall between the service classes and guarantee each class its link share. (See Section 4.) As a result, admission control for each class can be performed independently. 3.2 Statistical Multiplexing For flows requesting for the deterministic service, admission control should be based <p> In this section, we discuss how to generalize the delay bounds to networks in which links are hierarchically shared. 5 4.1 Directed Tree Model First, we describe a directed tree model, largely borrowed from <ref> [1] </ref>, for representation of a link sharing hierarchy. <p> Hierarchical link sharing can have a big impact on the performance of flows that share the link. Specifically, packets of a flow under the link sharing hierarchy are scheduled jointly by all ancestor nodes of the flow before being served by the link <ref> [1] </ref>. For hierarchical link sharing to be useful, appropriate scheduling algorithms must be used at the logical servers to minimize any negative impact on flow performance. We next define ideal link sharing to set a performance target for designing such scheduling algorithms. <p> Unfortunately, FFQ is not feasible. Therefore, scheduling algorithms that are good approximations of FFQ should be used at the logical servers. 4.2 Prior Work In <ref> [1] </ref>, Bennett and Zhang proposed a new approximation of FFQ, named Worst-case Fair Weighted Fair Queueing Plus (WF 2 Q+), for providing tight delay bounds to flows under a link sharing hierarchy. They defined a metric for a logical server called Normalized Bit Worst-case Fair Index (NB-WFI). <p> For example, if implementation complexity is of primary concern, round robin scheduling may be more desirable than others. Also, there are a large number of performance results in the literature for one-level servers. It is not obvious from <ref> [1, 6] </ref> how these results, e.g. those for WFQ servers [2] or even FIFO servers, can be extended to networks with hierarchical link sharing. Next we describe an approach in which link sharing and packet scheduling concerns are separated. <p> Let us look at two examples. Example 1 Assume that all ancestors of n are WF 2 Q+ servers and all packets have a fixed length of L bits. From Definition 1 and the fact that WF 2 Q+ guarantees a NB-WFI of L <ref> [1] </ref>, it can be shown that ffi n is at most ( h=0 r p h (n) Let us make the conservative assumption that r p h (n) =r p h+1 (n) = 0:5, h = 0; 1; : : : ; H (n) 1. (The ratio is usually much smaller <p> It is easy to see that FC versions of Virtual Clock [15] and Delay-EDD [3] servers belong to the SIP class. FC versions of servers that approximate a hypothetical constant rate Fluid model Fair Queueing (FFQ) server (such as WFQ [2], and PGPS [12] and WF 2 Q+ <ref> [1] </ref>) can be defined so that their packet priority values depend upon virtual times in the constant rate FFQ server and are thus SIP servers as well.

Reference-contexts: It is envisioned that future integrated services networks will support not only link sharing by multiple service classes (real-time service, best-effort service, etc.) but also by multiple administrative classes (different agencies and organizations) <ref> [4] </ref>. Specifically, packets (or cells) from sessions belonging to different service classes and administrative classes interact with one another when they are statistically multiplexed at an output link of a switch. The switch's packet scheduling algorithm plays an important role in controlling such link sharing.

Reference-contexts: In particular, a block of cells is either discarded or accepted entirely. For the ABT service, the concept of cell loss rate can be generalized to block loss rate. Such a generalization is backward-compatible with the existing ATM TM 4.0 service architecture <ref> [5] </ref> since a block is a sequence of cells, with a single cell being a special case.

Reference-contexts: The problem of scheduling packets for flows under a link sharing hierarchy was also studied by Goyal et al. in <ref> [6] </ref>, where an algorithm called Start-time Fair Queueing (SFQ) was proposed. Goyal et al. observed that the intermediate logical servers no longer have constant service rates for their children. Therefore, they analyzed the performance of SFQ in the context of Fluctuation Constrained servers first defined by Lee [10]. <p> Thus, if the logical servers (called virtual servers in <ref> [6] </ref>) are all SFQ servers, the packet delay bound for a flow under a link sharing hierarchy can be recursively computed. The exact bound is not given in [6]. 4.3 A General Approach While the authors cited above have made important contributions to the design of WF 2 Q+ and SFQ, <p> Thus, if the logical servers (called virtual servers in <ref> [6] </ref>) are all SFQ servers, the packet delay bound for a flow under a link sharing hierarchy can be recursively computed. The exact bound is not given in [6]. 4.3 A General Approach While the authors cited above have made important contributions to the design of WF 2 Q+ and SFQ, their approach is not the best. Specifically, too much emphasis was put on one good fair queueing algorithm for both link sharing and packet scheduling. <p> For example, if implementation complexity is of primary concern, round robin scheduling may be more desirable than others. Also, there are a large number of performance results in the literature for one-level servers. It is not obvious from <ref> [1, 6] </ref> how these results, e.g. those for WFQ servers [2] or even FIFO servers, can be extended to networks with hierarchical link sharing. Next we describe an approach in which link sharing and packet scheduling concerns are separated. <p> Example 2 Assume that all ancestors of n are SFQ servers and all packets have a fixed length of L bits. Applying Theorem 2 of <ref> [6] </ref>, it can be shown that ffi n is at most (1 + ( h=0 r p h+1 (n) where Q (h) is the number of branches that p h+1 (n) has.

Reference-contexts: The ATM block transfer (ABT) capability being standardized by ITU-T is based upon a similar observation <ref> [7] </ref>. The objective of ABT is to allow a data source to dynamically negotiate its bandwidth reservation on the basis of a block of cells. Note that a higher-layer protocol data unit, fragmented into a number of ATM cells, is lost if any one of its cells is lost.

At any time, because of burst scheduling, at most one block from each flow is active <ref> [8] </ref>. Denote i (t) the reserved cell rate for the block of flow i that is active at time t. ( i (t) = 0 if there is no active block for flow i at t.) In our analysis below, i (t)'s are considered independent random variables.

Reference-contexts: Goyal et al. observed that the intermediate logical servers no longer have constant service rates for their children. Therefore, they analyzed the performance of SFQ in the context of Fluctuation Constrained servers first defined by Lee <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> FC FIFO servers also belong to the SIP class since they in effect use the arrival time of a packet as the packet priority. (Lee obtained some delay bound results for FC FIFO servers with leaky bucket constrained sources <ref> [10] </ref>.) In particular, we consider two types of SIP servers: preemptive-resume with no overhead, and nonpreempt-ive. For a SIP server that is preemptive-resume with no overhead, it will immediately stop the service of a packet and serve a newly arrived packet if the new arrival has a smaller priority value. <p> They do not depend on specific admission control conditions or source control mechanisms. In contrast, most of Lee's analyses on FIFO FC servers <ref> [10] </ref> were done for leaky bucket constrained sources. The burst (block) delay bounds presented in Section 2.2 were derived from a delay guarantee of Virtual Clock servers that has the firewall property and accounts for out-of-order service [14].

Reference-contexts: It is straightforward to show that if every logical server is a Fluid model Fair Queueing (FFQ) server, 8 then 8 Also called General Processor Sharing (GPS) server in the literature <ref> [12] </ref>. ideal link sharing will be achieved for every logical server. Unfortunately, FFQ is not feasible. <p> It is easy to see that FC versions of Virtual Clock [15] and Delay-EDD [3] servers belong to the SIP class. FC versions of servers that approximate a hypothetical constant rate Fluid model Fair Queueing (FFQ) server (such as WFQ [2], and PGPS <ref> [12] </ref> and WF 2 Q+ [1]) can be defined so that their packet priority values depend upon virtual times in the constant rate FFQ server and are thus SIP servers as well.

Reference-contexts: With block-based admission control, cell losses are concentrated over a small number of blocks, and bandwidth is not wasted on delivery of partial blocks. (This is similar to the idea of early packet discard in recent studies on IP over ATM <ref> [13] </ref>.) Therefore, ABT is able to avoid the situation in which cell losses spread over a large number of higher-layer data units causing throughput degradation of such data units. With block-based admission control, ABT is also able to offer QoS measured in terms of blocks.
