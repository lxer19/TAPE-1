Abstract: We present strong evidence that the implication, "if one-way permutations exist, then secure secret agreement is possible", is not provable by standard techniques. Since both sides of this implication are widely believed true in real life, to show that the implication is false requires a new model. We consider a world where all parties have access to a black box for a randomly selected permutation. Being totally random, this permutation will be strongly one-way in a provable, information-theoretic sense. On the other hand, we show that, if P = N P , no protocol for secret agreement is secure in such a setting. We show as a consequence that there is no "black box" reduction from a one-way function to a secret-key agreement protocol. With only one exception that we know of, results reducing one cryprographic task or tool to another have been "black box" reductions. Furthermore, we show the existence of an oracle relative to which the implication is false, i.e., there is a one-way permutation, yet secret-agreement is impossible. Thus, no technique which relativizes can prove that secret exchange can be based on any one-way permutation. Our results present a general method for proving statements of the form, "Cryptographic application X has no black box reduction to complexity assumption Y ." Our main theorem immediately yields many corollaries of this form.

Reference-contexts: Non-relativizing proofs are few and far between not only in cryptography, but in complexity theory as a whole (although admittedly not as few as there were a few years ago [LFKN90],[Sha90]).

General assumptions which have been used in cryptography include the existence of : one-way permutations ( [P74] ), pseudo-random generators ( [BM84, Yao82] ), trap-door permutations ( [DH76]), and collision-intractable hash functions. <p> Similarly, if an assumption is sufficient to prove the possibility of secret agreement in a relativiz-ing manner, it itself cannot be proven from the existence of a one-way permutation via a "black box" reduction. Examples of such assumptions include oblivious transfer ( <ref> [Blu81, Rab81] </ref>), voting ([Ben87]), and trap-door functions ([DH76, RSA78, GM84]). To summarize: There is an oracle O relative to which all A's hold, but all B's do not. (See Table 1.) Progress has been made in understanding the finer structure of column A.

Reference-contexts: Cryptographic tasks to be discussed here include: coin flipping by telephone ( [Blu82] ), electronic signatures ( [DH76], [RSA78], [GMR84] ), private-key cryptography ( <ref> [GM84, GGM84, LR86, Rac88] </ref>), bit-commitment (both the strong commiter version ( [GMW87] ) and the strong receiver version ( [BCC87] ) ), identification ( [DH76], [FFS86] ), electronic voting ( [Ben87]), oblivious transfer ( [Blu81, Rab81] ), and secret agreement ( [DH76, Mer78] ).

Reference-contexts: In particular, this shows that secure secret agreement and the existence of trapdoor functions are not likely to be shown equivalent. Other issues in the structural theory of cryptography remain open. For example, it is open whether a one-way permutation can be based on an arbitrary one-way function. Rudich <ref> [Rud88] </ref> has shown that if a certain unproven combinatorial conjecture holds then there is no such black box reduction. The existence of a non-relativizing reduction from one-way functions to secret key agreement remains possible. The discovery of such a reduction would constitute a major advance in cryptography.

Reference-contexts: We have previously given a list of applications at least as strong as secret key agreement; that these are unlikely to be a consequences of the existence of a one-way permutation follows from the result here. Rudich <ref> [Rud91] </ref> has shown that, from the point of view of black box reducibility, it is not possible to base a k-round secret key agreement protocol on a secret key agreement protocol requiring k + 1 rounds.

Reference-contexts: In particular, Pseudorandom generators, Private-key cryptosystems, Telephone coin flipping, Bit commitment, and Signatures have all been shown black-box equivalent to the existence of one-way functions (by relativizing techniques) <ref> [HILL91, IL89, Rom90, Naor89] </ref>. Some caution is needed in interpreting these results, since at least one non-relativizing construction in cryptography is known.

Reference-contexts: Since all current methods are based on number theory, it is possible that a new advance in this subject could eliminate all current methods of secret agreement at once. (For another potential threat, see <ref> [Shor84] </ref>.) Already, improved algorithms have forced key sizes in secret agreement protocols beyond what was believed unbreakable at the time RSA was introduced ([DDLM93]). We provide strong evidence that it will be difficult to prove that secure secret agreement is possible assuming only that a one-way permutation exists.
