Abstract: Study of the dynamics of the MAC protocol have shown that significant performance improvement can be obtained when the contention mini-slots are placed as frequently as possible in the sea of upstream mini-slots. Contribution 96-251 showed the improvement when a p-persistence contention resolution algorithm (CRA) is used. In this contribution we study ternary tree CRAs. It is shown that a free-access scheme (msSTART) achieves similar improvements with no significant increase in complexity. On the other hand it is pointed out that a blocked scheme as specified in the current standard fits better in a clustered environment than in a continuous-mode environment.

Reference-contexts: Therefore it obtains similar improvement (like the p-persistence mechanism) in a continuous-mode CSA compared to a clustered CSA. A measure of this improvement is shown in Fig. 1 which compares under Type 1 traffic a cluster scenario of the current draft using piggybacking (curve c) <ref> [1] </ref> and the tree CRA in a continuous CSA with no piggybacking (curve t). Note that the minimum access delay at low loads in curve c could be reduced by choosing a smaller frame size. Possible reasons that produce the differences at higher loads are identified in Section 3.

Reference-contexts: In document 96-251 we presented the performance of the p-persistence CRA in a continuous-mode environment. In this contribution we study the performance of tree schemes in the same environment and we compare them with the p-persistence results. The performance of a free-access tree scheme (msSTART <ref> [2] </ref>) is shown to be similar to the p-persistence performance. <p> In a variable slot structure this number varies thus it is mandatory to operate in a variable interleave environment. The management of these interleaves significantly increases both the complexity of the system and the downstream overhead required for the head-end to station communication. The msSTART algorithm <ref> [2] </ref> avoids all this complexity. Its ability to decouple the physical location of the CMSs from the state of the stack (combined with its free-access property) permits efficient operation with a single interleave at any instant of time.

Reference-contexts: Similar behavior is seen in Fig. 7 when comparing the jitter measures. contributions to represent jitter is a normalized measure of this value. 4 Table 2: Maximum Multiplicity of Collision (Type 2 Traffic) Ternary Tree Load p-persistence Blocked Free Soft-unblocking (adaptive) 1 access 1 access 1 Piggybacking 2 <ref> [3] </ref> 0.05 3 3 3 0.3 7 11 8 0.4 7 33 8 0.44 9 132 8 0.55 8 2 191 5 2 15 1 Length of the simulation: 20sec. 2 Length of the simulation: 30sec. <p> Table 3: Maximum Multiplicity of Collision (Average Request Size = 32 mini-slots) Ternary Tree Load 1 p-persistence Blocked Free Soft-unblocking (adaptive) 1 access 1 access 1 Piggybacking 2 <ref> [3] </ref> 0.4 7 8 6 6 0.55 8 19 10 10 0.85 7 195 11 7 1 Type 1 Traffic: Maximum Request Size = 1 message; Message size = 32. 2 Type 2 Traffic: Maximum Request Size = 32 messages; Message size = 1. <p> In the mid range of loads the degree of blocking is more uncertain. An indication of the blocking degree is the multiplicity of collision. The multiplicity results of this implementation are shown in Tables 2 and 3. For comparison the available soft-unblocking results are also included <ref> [3] </ref>. (Note though that the traffic model is different. Our simulation does not support sending a request for more than one message at a time. Both traffic models have an average request size of 32 mini-slots at high loads).

Reference-contexts: The result is that for the logical topologies the tree does better but when we compare with the full capabilities of the p-persistence the differences between tree and p-persistence become negligible. For comparison, Fig. 15 also includes the latest results <ref> [4] </ref> for the soft-unblocking scheme in a cluster-mode of operation (curve c). These results are taken from Fig. 6 (curve P-tree) of document 802.14/97-037.
