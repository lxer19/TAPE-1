Abstract: We present a new distance-vector routing protocol for a packet radio network. The new distributed routing protocol, WRP, works on the notion of second-to-last hop node to a destination. WRP reduces the number of cases in which a temporary routing loop can occur and also provides a mechanism for the reliable transmission of update messages. The performance of WRP has been compared quantitatively by simulations with that of distributed Bellman-Ford (DBF), DUAL (a loop-free distance-vector algorithm) and an ideal link-state algorithm (ILS) which represents the state of the art of Internet routing, in a highly dynamic environment. The simulation results indicate that WRP is the most efficient of the algorithms simulated in a wireless environment.

According to DBF, a node knows the length of the shortest path from each neighbor node to every network destination and this information is used to compute the shortest path and next node in the path to each destination.

Reference-contexts: Even though this algorithm provides multiple paths to the destination, because of the query-based synchronization approach to achieve loop-free paths, the communication complexity could be high.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, there is a need for a new routing protocol which is devoid of all these drawbacks. In the recent past, a number of efforts have been made to address the limitation of DBF and topology broadcast in mobile wireless networks. One such effort is the DSDV protocol <ref> [5] </ref>. In this protocol, each mobile host which is a specialized router, periodically advertises its view of the interconnection topology with other mo bile hosts within the network thereby maintaining an up to date information about the status of the network. But, DSDV suffers from the inherent problem of synchronization.

Reference-contexts: Also, it uses both periodic and triggered updates for updating routing information. This could cause excessive overhead. A distributed routing algorithm for mobile wireless networks based on diffusing computations has been proposed by Corson and Ephremides <ref> [6] </ref>. This protocol relies on the exchange of short control packets forming a query-reply process. It also has the ability to maintain multiple paths to a given destination. This is a destination-oriented protocol in which separate versions of the algorithm run independently for each destination.

Reference-contexts: Because of DBF's performance problems, most router manufacturers have opted for routing protocols based on topology broadcast such as OSPF <ref> [12] </ref>. However, there are significant differences between the wired Internet over which standard routing protocols are used today, and wireless networks. Today's networks have relatively high bandwidth and topologies that change infrequently; in contrast, wireless networks have mobile nodes and have limited bandwidth for network control.

Reference-contexts: This can lead to slow convergence, or incur substantial processing by requiring a node to update its entire routing table for each input event. To address these problems, we have proposed a path-finding algorithm, PFA, that substantially reduces the temporary looping situations <ref> [13] </ref>. The rest of this paper describes a routing protocol for a packet radio network based on PFA, which we call wireless routing protocol (WRP). Section 2 gives a detailed description of WRP, illustrating the key aspects of the protocol's operation. <p> The resulting simplified version of WRP we simulated is called path finding algorithm (PFA), and is the same basic algorithm first described in <ref> [13] </ref>. Similarly, ILS, DBF, and DUAL correspond to the ideal case of the best protocols that could be designed based on these algorithms.

Reference-contexts: This illustrates how step (2) of WRP helps in the reduction of the formation of temporary loops in the explicit paths. 3 Simulation Results To gain insight into the average-case performance of WRP in a dynamic environment, we have simulated its operation using an actor-based, discrete-event simulation language called Drama <ref> [15] </ref>, together with a network simulation library. Link failures and recoveries are simulated by sending link status message to the nodes at the end points of the appropriate links.
