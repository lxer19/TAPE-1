Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of interpolating univariate polynomials over a field of characteristic zero that are sparse in (a) the Pochhammer basis or, (b) the Chebyshev basis. The polynomials are assumed to be given by black boxes, i.e., one can obtain the value of a polynomial at any point by querying its black box. We describe efficient new algorithms for these problems. Our algorithms may be regarded as generalizations of Ben-Or and Tiwari's (1988) algorithm (based on the BCH decoding algorithm) for interpolating polynomials that are sparse in the standard basis. The arithmetic complexity of the algorithms is O(t 2 + t log d) which is also the complexity of the univariate version of the Ben-Or and Tiwari algorithm. That algorithm and those presented here also share the requirement of 2t evaluation points.

Reference-contexts: Then, we can interpolate f (x) from its values at x = 1; 2; : : : ; 2t: The algorithm follows from an observation in <ref> (Grigoriev, Karpinski, Singer 1991a) </ref> which places this problem in the framework of Dress and Grabmeier. It is an elementary fact that the finite difference operator behaves like the derivative on the Pochhammer symbol.

Reference-contexts: rational functions can be evaluated quickly and that makes them attractive to several applications and an interesting line of research is to try to infer properties of sparse polynomials (such as divisibility, existence of non-trivial gcd, the existence of real roots etc.) from their values at a small number points <ref> (see Grigoriev-Karpinski-Odlyzko 1992) </ref>. Traditionally, "sparse polynomial (or rational function)" is taken to mean a polynomial (or rational function) with a "few terms" where the "terms" are power products of the variables involved. <p> For example, suppose we know that the polynomial given by a black box is t-sparse in the basis 1; x ff; (x ff) 2 ; (x ff) 3 ; : : : for some unknown ff: Two recent papers discuss algorithms for solving this problem <ref> (Grigoriev-Karpinski 1992, Lakshman-Saunders 1993) </ref>. Sparsity in the standard basis is related to the number of real roots of the polynomial (sparsity limits the number of variations in sign), which is not the case when we consider polynomials that are sparse in the Chebyshev or Pochhammer bases.
