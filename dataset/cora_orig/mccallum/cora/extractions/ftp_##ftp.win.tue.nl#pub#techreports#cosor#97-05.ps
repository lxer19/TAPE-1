Reference-contexts: We keep on adding products, each one satisfying (10), so as to alternately satisfy the two boundary conditions. This results in an infinite sum of products. The sum is a formal solution of the equilibrium equations. What remains is the proof of convergence. This can be found in <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. The conclusion is formulated below.

Hence Theorem 3.2 provides an explicit characterization of p (m; n). And based on the expression for p (m; n) similar expressions may be derived for performance characteristics, such as the mean waiting time and mean queue lenghts. <p> Remark 3.4 (General result) Above we developed an approach to solve the shortest queue problem.

Reference-contexts: The approach to solve the equilibrium equations will be based on separation of variables, an elementary approach for the solution of partial differential equations. Below we demonstrate this approach for a simple problem of conduction of heat (cf. Carslaw and Jaeger <ref> [8] </ref>). Then we will show how the same approach can be used to determine the probabilities p (n).

Reference-contexts: These equations can be viewed as difference equations. In the theory of differential equations, the continuous analogue of difference equations, a well-known solution approach is separation of variables (see e.g. Garabedian <ref> [11] </ref>). This method attempts to solve differential equations by constructing sums of product-form solutions. It seems natural to investigate whether it is also possible to solve equilibrium equations by sums of product-form solutions.

Reference-contexts: Suppose that their distance of centers is c (see figure 5). Below we show how the potential outside the spheres can be found by the method of images (see e.g. Maxwell <ref> [18] </ref>). If the spheres did not influence each other (c = 1), then the potential is that of point charge ff 0 = a a located at A. However, since c is finite, the potential does not vanish on sphere B.
