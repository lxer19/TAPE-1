Abstract: Levesque and Brachman argue that in order to provide timely and correct responses in the most critical applications, general purpose knowledge representation systems should restrict their languages by omitting constructs which require non-polynomial worst-case response times for sound and complete classification. They also separate terminological and assertional knowledge, and restrict classification to purely terminological information. We demonstrate that restricting the terminological language and classifier in these ways limits these "general-purpose" facilities so severely that they are no longer generally applicable. We argue that logical soundness, completeness, and worst-case complexity are inadequate measures for evaluating the utility of representation services, and that this evaluation should employ the broader notions of utility and rationality found in decision theory. We suggest that general purpose representation services should provide fully expressive languages, classification over relevant contingent information, "approximate" forms of classification involving defaults, and rational management of inference tools.

Reference-contexts: Structural interrelationships between various components of a concept's description were the quintessential elements of the si-net (Structured Inheritance NETwork) paradigm on which kl-one is based <ref> [2] </ref>. si-net and kl-one provided powerful languages for expressing these interrelationships, including a complete set of boolean connectives, quantification, set inequality, mapping functions, and a general "parametric individual" mechanism which allowed any concept defined in the knowledge base to be used as an n-ary predicate in specifying constraints among roles. 4 <p> This example, in fact, serves as a central source of examples for Brachman's argument (see <ref> [2] </ref>, [3, p. 35ff]) stressing the need for specifications of the structural relations between role fillers. One can use unary and binary predicates to name the aspects of higher arity functions and relations, with each place represented by a role, e.g., the addend, augend, and sum roles of an addition.

Instead of being definable by sets of necessary and sufficient conditions, natural kinds appear to be conceptually convenient bundles of default properties which describe the prototype to which their instances bear family resemblances.

Reference-contexts: Classification is also very general, as it is essentially equivalent to logical entailment, and so capable of supporting most forms of logical inference. 1.1 Language restrictions and restricted classification Brachman, Levesque, and Fikes <ref> [6] </ref> argue that the inferential operations of a knowledge representation system should be efficient in addition to being sound and complete. They suggest viewing representation systems as embedded utilities or subsystems providing computational services in support of more general reasoning or problem solving. <p> We call thesis (4) the restricted language thesis. Motivated in part by the semantically confusing nature of many early representation systems, in which it was sometimes difficult to tell whether representations were meant to define prototypes or to assert facts, Brachman, Fikes and Levesque <ref> [6] </ref> draw on the logical distinction between terms and axioms to divide knowledge bases into two parts. The terminological knowledge base (TBox) stores terms and their definitions, while the assertional knowledge base (ABox) stores sentences constructed using these terms. <p> We call thesis (5) the restricted classification thesis. These theses were promulgated in the context of the descendants of kl-one [8, 37], namely nikl [41, 26, 15] (the New Implementation of KL-one), kl-two [41], kandor [30], 3 Doyle & Patil krypton <ref> [6] </ref>, and back [42, 27]. <p> Our concern in this paper is solely with the restricted language and restricted classification theses, which have continued to exert influence on the field since their first appearances in <ref> [4, 6, 7, 19] </ref>.

"Knowing," in this sense, amounts to possessing a full understanding of all the consequences of definitions. <p> Our concern in this paper is solely with the restricted language and restricted classification theses, which have continued to exert influence on the field since their first appearances in <ref> [4, 6, 7, 19] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Optimizing definitional and assertional inferences separately maximizes the efficiency of the representation system. 5. Therefore, representation systems should restrict taxonomic classification to termino logical definitions alone. We call thesis (5) the restricted classification thesis. These theses were promulgated in the context of the descendants of kl-one <ref> [8, 37] </ref>, namely nikl [41, 26, 15] (the New Implementation of KL-one), kl-two [41], kandor [30], 3 Doyle & Patil krypton [6], and back [42, 27]. <p> For example, if a human parent is defined to be a human who has a child, recognizing that some person is a parent allows one to apply reasoning appropriate to parents in addition to that appropriate merely to humans. More formally, Brachman and Schmolze <ref> [8, pp. 178,189] </ref> present an extended example of classification-based recognition in a language-understanding task. <p> ) P-reducible (p 0 ; p) (5) Implicitly temporal implications: An animal is dangerous (to humans) if it attacks them when nearby. 8x dangerous-animal (x) animal (x) ^ 8h human (h) ^ near (x; h) attacks (x; h) (6) Explicitly temporal implications: An "urgent message", according to Brachman and Schmolze <ref> [8] </ref>, is a message whose reply-by date is less than one hour later than its received-by date. This is an example of an explicitly temporal conditional, one in which the conditions themselves refer to specific instants of time. <p> It appears that for many applications, a large majority of concepts must be entered as primitives in kl-one-style languages. Some support for this assessment comes from noticing that the great majority of concepts are primitive in many of the sample networks published by Brachman and Schmolze <ref> [8] </ref>. These diagrams, however, may have been simplified for publication by leaving out some expressible concepts. Stronger evidence comes from the previously mentioned project of rewriting in nikl the ABEL system for acid-base electrolyte diagnosis (see [13]). <p> In part, this is due to the requirement that classification perform only sound, correct inferences. In addition, Brachman and Schmolze <ref> [8, p. 189] </ref> argue that defaults and exceptions should not be part of the terminological database because they make classification too hard. This argument would have more force if the tractable part of classification provided more useful answers than the tractable part of classification or categorization over concepts with defaults.

Reference-contexts: Instead, a better view is that the purpose of representational services is to provide the rational or optimal conclusions rather than the logically sound conclusions (see also Doyle <ref> [9] </ref>), and that representation systems should be rational agents using the user's knowledge and purposes to cooperate with the user to accomplish those purposes.

Reference-contexts: Two ways of doing this involve restricting the notion of completeness, either by seeking completeness with respect to weaker logics (see, for example [31]), or by seeking completeness with respect to ordinary deduction over sublanguages (see, for example <ref> [10, 11] </ref>). Virtually all the work on restricted language classification can be immediately reformulated as a contribution toward this end.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Much recent work on general-purpose knowledge representation systems views knowledge bases as propositional databases which can answer some questions by making inferences from the stored propositions as well as simply retrieving stored propositions (see, for example, <ref> [11, 17, 18] </ref>). <p> Two ways of doing this involve restricting the notion of completeness, either by seeking completeness with respect to weaker logics (see, for example [31]), or by seeking completeness with respect to ordinary deduction over sublanguages (see, for example <ref> [10, 11] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: They reject this possibility in part because little is known about reasonable distributions over queries that would, for example, allow average times to be calculated for different algorithms, or even how to calculate such averages if we knew the distributions. (But see Goldberg <ref> [12] </ref>, who demonstrates that the exponential worst case satisfiability problems are sparse, and that average complexity is polynomial.) Contrary to Levesque's and Brachman's claim, however, this theoretical ignorance need not be a serious impediment to reliance on average response times since we may summarize practical experience in estimates of average running

Reference-contexts: Our arguments grow out of considerable experience with the inadequacies of nikl (see <ref> [13] </ref>), but are not limited to nikl. Recognition of the disappointing limitations of these systems occurred only through this experience and we do not believe these failures could have been predicted with certainty when the choices underlying these designs were made. <p> The several successful nikl applications to limited tasks of natural-language understanding, automatic programming and planning encouraged this expectation. However, at least two separate research efforts using nikl, those of Haimowitz, Patil, and Szolovits <ref> [13] </ref> and Smo-liar and Swartout [39], have found these restrictions to be very serious impediments to the development of useful knowledge bases. As the broad scope of the examples indicates, the difficulties these efforts experienced are merely the tip of the iceberg. <p> These diagrams, however, may have been simplified for publication by leaving out some expressible concepts. Stronger evidence comes from the previously mentioned project of rewriting in nikl the ABEL system for acid-base electrolyte diagnosis (see <ref> [13] </ref>). This effort revealed that fewer than a third of the concepts in this knowledge base were classifiable, as most important concepts referred either to domain 17 Doyle & Patil specific natural kinds or to inexpressible concepts. A similar experience is related by Smoliar and Swartout [39]. <p> Our arguments show that though classification is useful as a special purpose subsystem, giving it this central role destroys the generality of the overall system.

Reference-contexts: An example of this difficulty is provided by the nikl reimplementations of XPLAIN and ABEL.

Both systems were originally implemented using XLMS <ref> [14] </ref>. Each used the same notion of causality in its knowledge base, and the original knowledge bases were sufficiently compatible to allow the two programs to share some of the same utilities (among others, the natural language generator).

Reference-contexts: In particular, "adequate response" has been taken to mean time polynomial in the size of the knowledge base. 1 This need has motivated research to identify inferential operations that can be mechanized efficiently. However, general logical inference operations like classification are not always efficiently mechanizable. Indeed, Levesque and Brachman <ref> [19] </ref> have shown that there is a tradeoff between expressive power and the computational cost of classification which, depending on the richness of the language in which definitions are expressed, can range from tractable to undecidable. <p> Either of these lapses from correctness can render answers undependable in critical applications. With these alternatives dismissed, Levesque and Brachman recommend the remaining path of restricting the language. In summary, Levesque and Brachman <ref> [19, pp. 81-82] </ref> argue that 1 This sense of "adequate response" is very generous, in that one can expect that the knowledge bases of broadly intelligent systems will be very large, so that even time linear in the size of the knowledge base could be significant. 2 Two Theses of Knowledge <p> While kl-one itself was designed earlier, without concern for language restrictions, the designs of krypton, kandor, and back involved theoretical analyses (e.g., <ref> [19] </ref> and [27]) to see what linguistic constructs could be efficiently classified and what constructs should be included or forbidden. nikl exhibits similar restrictions, but these came about by abandoning some poorly defined kl-one constructs rather than by explicitly attempting to ensure classificatory tractability. 2 As a group, these systems have <p> Whether one concept subsumes another follows purely from their definitions. As noted earlier, subsumption is not decidable for sufficiently expressive languages. Restricted classes of languages do exist, however, for which subsump-tion is decidable, even in polynomial time. (See <ref> [19] </ref> for examples drawn from knowledge representation languages.) To classify a new concept with respect to a hierarchy of concept definitions means to determine its place in the subsumption partial order. <p> Toward this end, we employ ordinary logical languages as the standard against 6 This goes against the intent of Levesque and Brachman <ref> [19] </ref> that everything expressible has effect, that none of the expressions are treated as comments by the system. <p> Levesque and Brachman <ref> [19, p. 79] </ref> motivate this demand in terms of the goal of shared understanding, which means that the knowledge base understands the user's meanings and the user understands the knowledge base's meanings. <p> need not be augmentations of databases at all, but something both more (in the inferences they support) and less (in the content they permit) than databases. 7 Classification's efficiency Levesque and Brachman's argument for the restricted language thesis views representation services as subroutines to which the agent (temporarily) surrenders control <ref> [19, p. 81] </ref>. Because the reasoner using the representation service must be able to act when necessary, they conclude that the terminological language must exclude any construct that can lead to large polynomial or exponential computation times during calls to these subroutines. But subroutines are very special forms of services. <p> While Levesque and Brachman do not explicitly consider all ways of taking into account the probabilities of encountering worst-case behaviors, they explicitly reject the suggestion that efficiency be measured by the average time needed for classification <ref> [19, p. 81] </ref>. <p> This recognition of the "multi-dimensionality" of knowledge representation problems lies at the heart of Brachman and Levesque's emphasis (in <ref> [19] </ref>) on the importance of tradeoffs in choosing architectures, and we view it as one of the many points of agreement we have with their overall view of knowledge representation. <p> Our concern in this paper is solely with the restricted language and restricted classification theses, which have continued to exert influence on the field since their first appearances in <ref> [4, 6, 7, 19] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, the attention they pay to classification-based recognition suggests that they expected it to suffice for most cases of recognition. Others appear to have shared this expectation as well, for classification has been exploited for recognition tasks in the consul system <ref> [20] </ref> and sudo-planner [43]. 1.4 kl-one-style expressive constructs As further background to our discussion, we outline the expressive constructs common to restricted kl-one-style languages. Readers familiar with these languages may wish to 7 Doyle & Patil skip to Section 2.

Reference-contexts: Richer logics that permit expression of even more concepts would serve our arguments just as well. 8 The benefit we seek in using logic as an analytical tool is that it facilitates clear statement and analysis of representation problems, as in McCarthy and Hayes' <ref> [22] </ref> epistemological approach and Newell's [29] knowledge level analysis.

Reference-contexts: Everybody, of course, knows that E = mc 2 , but how many understand it? Against this ordinary usage, the goal of terminological competence confounds knowing and understanding. 17 As Minsky <ref> [23, p. 128] </ref> observes, "thinking begins first with suggestive but defective plans and images that are slowly (if ever) refined and replaced by better ones." This is especially true of almost all learning and knowledge engineering tasks.

Reference-contexts: Of course, the purposes or goals need not be passed as explicit parameters, but might be stored in the same knowledge base as shared goals. Obtaining expectations about tool performance and distribution of queries is more difficult. This problem might be amenable to machine learning techniques (see, for example, <ref> [24] </ref>). 9 Conclusion Levesque and Brachman argue that in order to be useful for the most critical applications, general purpose knowledge representation systems should restrict their languages by omitting constructs which require non-polynomial (or otherwise unacceptably long) worst-case response times for correct classification of concepts.

Reference-contexts: See, for example, Schmolze's <ref> [25, p. 3] </ref> definition of binary trees.

Reference-contexts: We call thesis (5) the restricted classification thesis.

Reference-contexts: But as we saw above, the fragment of deductive classification provided by kl-one-style languages is very limited. Indeed, recent results of Patel-Schneider [32] and Nebel <ref> [28] </ref> mean that even these languages are too rich, according to the restricted language thesis.

Reference-contexts: Richer logics that permit expression of even more concepts would serve our arguments just as well. 8 The benefit we seek in using logic as an analytical tool is that it facilitates clear statement and analysis of representation problems, as in McCarthy and Hayes' [22] epistemological approach and Newell's <ref> [29] </ref> knowledge level analysis.

Reference-contexts: Two ways of doing this involve restricting the notion of completeness, either by seeking completeness with respect to weaker logics (see, for example <ref> [31] </ref>), or by seeking completeness with respect to ordinary deduction over sublanguages (see, for example [10, 11]). Virtually all the work on restricted language classification can be immediately reformulated as a contribution toward this end.

Reference-contexts: 2 We understand from Peter Patel-Schneider (personal communication, 1988) that nikl was designed around an existing fast but partial kl-one classifier algorithm rather than through an initial theoretical analysis. 3 The two theses of knowledge representation we criticize in some ways parallel the two dogmas of empiricism discussed by Quine <ref> [34] </ref>, hence the title of this paper.

Reference-contexts: features fits right in with the restricted language approach to making classification efficient, as general SD's might express arbitrary logical relationships, and so not be amenable to efficient (or even decidable) classification. 5 Details of the nikl knowledge language and its functional interface can be found in the nikl manual <ref> [36] </ref>. nikl is unlike krypton and kl-two in that it has no facility for making assertions that use the concepts it defines, but this will not matter for our discussion. nikl also provides no adequate mechanism for representing instances of concepts. 8 Two Theses of Knowledge Representation Construct Use Meaning (CMeet

Reference-contexts: But since efficient classifiers are unable to fully appreciate all the implications of some definitions, the knowledge base can understand the user's meanings only if the terminological language is restricted so that complete classification is possible over the restricted language. Drawing on Smith <ref> [38] </ref>, Levesque and Brachman state that 15 It is worth noting that the incompleteness of nikl's classifier has not seemed to matter in practical applications.

Reference-contexts: The several successful nikl applications to limited tasks of natural-language understanding, automatic programming and planning encouraged this expectation. However, at least two separate research efforts using nikl, those of Haimowitz, Patil, and Szolovits [13] and Smo-liar and Swartout <ref> [39] </ref>, have found these restrictions to be very serious impediments to the development of useful knowledge bases. As the broad scope of the examples indicates, the difficulties these efforts experienced are merely the tip of the iceberg. <p> Even if one is willing to live with incompatible representations that cannot be shared among applications, inventing new external mechanisms is a lot of work that must be repeated for each application. For example, Smoliar and Swartout found this effort so burdensome that they developed a more expressive language <ref> [39] </ref> to use instead of nikl. 16 Two Theses of Knowledge Representation Such extended languages, of course, mean that the classifier must be either incomplete or excessively slow in the worst case. <p> This effort revealed that fewer than a third of the concepts in this knowledge base were classifiable, as most important concepts referred either to domain 17 Doyle & Patil specific natural kinds or to inexpressible concepts. A similar experience is related by Smoliar and Swartout <ref> [39] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, the attention they pay to classification-based recognition suggests that they expected it to suffice for most cases of recognition.

Reference-contexts: Other undefinable functions and relations include concepts of betweenness, conduits, supports, escape routes, connected routes, and most assemblies of parts and wholes. Indeed, defining the classic AI illustration of an arch of toy blocks involves defining interrelations among its structural components (the vertical and horizontal clearances, for instance|see <ref> [44, p. 52, Fig. 5] </ref>) that cannot be expressed in the restricted language. This example, in fact, serves as a central source of examples for Brachman's argument (see [2], [3, p. 35ff]) stressing the need for specifications of the structural relations between role fillers.
