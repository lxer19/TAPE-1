Abstract: Let A be a complex matrix with arbitrary Jordan structure, and an eigenvalue of A whose largest Jordan block has size n: We review previous results due to Lidskii [10], showing that the splitting of under a small perturbation of A of order " is, generically, of order " 1=n . Explicit formulas for the leading coefficients are obtained, involving the perturbation matrix and the eigenvectors of A: We also present an alternative proof of Lidskii's main theorem, based on the use of the Newton diagram. This approach clarifies certain difficulties which arise in the nongeneric case, and leads, in some situations, to the extension of Lidskii's results. These results suggest a new notion of Holder condition number for multiple eigenvalues, depending only on the associated left and right eigenvectors, appropriately normalized, not on the Jordan vectors.

Reference-contexts: We end by proposing in Section 4 a new notion of Holder condition number for multiple eigenvalues, suggested by Lidskii's results. Although it is closely related to previous Holder condition numbers in the literature ( <ref> [4] </ref> p.156), its main difference is that it only depends on the associated left and right eigenvectors, appropriately normalized, not on the Jordan vectors. 2. Lidskii's perturbation theory. <p> Without loss of generality, one can take jjxjj = 1, so ff = jjyjj. Thus the condition number reduces to the standard definition ( <ref> [4] </ref>, p. 152); see also [5], p. 202, where the normalization used is jjxjj = jjyjj = 1, giving the definition 1=(yx) for the condition number. 2. <p> For ffi &gt; 0, one has x = [1 0] T , y = [1 1=(2ffi)], so cond (ffi) = (1; ff) with ff = jjxjj jjyjj = p 1 + 1=(4ffi 2 ). Since the eigenvalue is simple, this condition number coincides with those given by <ref> [4] </ref> and [5]. As ffi # 0, the coefficient ff in cond (ffi) diverges to +1. For ffi = 0, the eigenvalue = ffi has multiplicity two, so the definitions given in [4] (p. 152) and [5] do not apply. <p> Since the eigenvalue is simple, this condition number coincides with those given by <ref> [4] </ref> and [5]. As ffi # 0, the coefficient ff in cond (ffi) diverges to +1. For ffi = 0, the eigenvalue = ffi has multiplicity two, so the definitions given in [4] (p. 152) and [5] do not apply. In this case, A is in Jordan form, so one has x = [1 0] T , y = [0 1], and cond (0) = (2; 1). <p> Thus, although the condition number is not a continuous function of ffi in the conventional sense, the divergence of ff as ffi # 0 is reflected by the drop in the power 1=n 1 at the limit point. Chatelin ( <ref> [4] </ref>, p. 156) has also introduced a closely related Holder condition num ber in the more general context of clusters of eigenvalues. Let us restrict our attention to the case where the cluster consists of one multiple eigenvalue of multiplicity n.
