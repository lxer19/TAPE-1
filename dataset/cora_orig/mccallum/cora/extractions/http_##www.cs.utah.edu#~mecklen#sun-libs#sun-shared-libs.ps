Abstract: This paper describes experiences converting a large software project to a shared library implementation. The project consisted of 430,000 lines of C++ code most of which resided in libraries. Due to the size of the project and its portability requirements we decided that the shared library implementation must be largely transparent to the application. Sun's shared library scheme was chosen. During the conversion numerous problems were encountered ranging from bugs in the implementation, to scalability problems, to fundamental semantic mismatches between shared libraries and the C++ programming language. The results of the conversion are discussed in terms of efficiency in space and time, source code portability, programmer convenience, and system maintainability.
