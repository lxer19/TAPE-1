Reference-contexts: For some mathematical description of coupling heterogeneous models for compressible flows we refer the readers to [19]. For three dimensional flows, it is shown in <ref> [1, 20] </ref> that the computation cost can be reduced by a factor of two for a Navier-Stokes/full potential coupling. <p> In general, the cost of the full potential solver can be considered negligible compared to the Navier-Stokes solver. Note that each region is solved alternatively, similar to a subdomain iterative method. Our formulation differs from <ref> [1, 20] </ref> by providing a general finite volume approach and therefore ensure that the mass will also remain conserved at the discrete level. This approach also has the advantage of being readily extended to a coupled implicit scheme.

This approach also has the advantage of being readily extended to a coupled implicit scheme. While in [1, 20] each region is solved separately, we are expecting to improve convergence by solving the coupled system simultaneously. In addition, an unstructured discretization of the computational domain provides more flexibility to mesh complex geometry and for adaptive control of the numerical error.

Numerical techniques for the solution of the full potential equation and the Euler/Navier-Stokes equations were developed respectively in the 1970s and in the 1980s <ref> [2, 10, 13, 15, 18] </ref>. Indeed, compressible flow around entire aircrafts have been simulated. For example, the full potential equation has been solved for a 747-200 transport configuration with wing, body, struts, and nacelles [23].

Reference-contexts: First, we intend to develop an implicit scheme which is essential for large scale simulations [17]. The convergence rates reported with implicit schemes are much faster, in particular when using methods such as the overlapping Schwarz preconditioned GMRES methods <ref> [3] </ref>. In our formulation, the Jacobian matrix used in the implicit approach will include the spatial discretization of two or more equations. It is expected that such system is not positive definite and thus it is not clear how it can be solved efficiently or which preconditioner should perform well.

Therefore, the same control volume is used and only the flux calculations are different.

Recall that we are only interested in solving the steady state and a simple time integration scheme offers more flexibility to be coupled with the full potential solver.

Reference-contexts: As mentioned above, a finite volume formulation is adopted to adequately interface these different solvers. An explicit approach is first considered to validate the spatial discretization but also as a precursor to the implicit implementation <ref> [17] </ref>. For simplicity, we address steady flows. For unsteady flows, it is required to have the temporal derivative of the density which is difficult to include in our explicit scheme because this derivation involves potential values of the neighboring control volumes. <p> As already mentioned, to obtain the most accurate flow simulation, the full Navier-Stokes equations need to be included in our multi-model 3 formulation. A more urgent objective, however, is to address some algorithmic extensions. First, we intend to develop an implicit scheme which is essential for large scale simulations <ref> [17] </ref>. The convergence rates reported with implicit schemes are much faster, in particular when using methods such as the overlapping Schwarz preconditioned GMRES methods [3]. In our formulation, the Jacobian matrix used in the implicit approach will include the spatial discretization of two or more equations.
