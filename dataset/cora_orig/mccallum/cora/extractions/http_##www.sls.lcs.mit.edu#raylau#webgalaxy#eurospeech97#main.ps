Abstract: The growth in the quantity of information and services offered online has been phenomenal. Nevertheless, access mechanisms have remained relatively primitive, requiring users to primarily point and click their way through a forest of Web links and to expend valuable cognitive capacities to track the geography of the Web space. Conversational systems can provide an intuitive, flexible multi-modal interface to online resources. The explosive growth of the World Wide Web, the continuing standardization of Web related technologies, and the growing penetration of Internet access enable us to embed a very thin client inside a standard Web browser, making conversational interfaces available to a much wider audience. This paper presents WebGALAXY, a conversational spoken language system for access to selected online resources from within a typical browser. A thin Java based client is employed as the front end with much of the speech and natural language processing occuring on remote servers.

Reference-contexts: We, as do others, believe that a speech interface to the Web is ideal, especially for naive users, because it is a natural, flexible, efficient and economical form of human communications. Some work of which we are aware in this area include: Texas Instruments' SAM (speech aware multimedia, <ref> [3] </ref>) is a speech interface to a Web browser.

Reference-contexts: While such an approach allows for precise control over the display, we feel that HTML is adequate for most displays and is capable of supporting particular customizations. However, for specialized applications, a custom Java controlled display may be appropriate (e.g., air travel in <ref> [5] </ref>). More details on our Java applet can be found in [6]. We have also implemented a forms version of Web-GALAXY for use at locations where the resources do not support the Java version, e.g., where communications bandwidth is too low or where the browser does not support Java.

Reference-contexts: However, for specialized applications, a custom Java controlled display may be appropriate (e.g., air travel in [5]).

We have also implemented a forms version of Web-GALAXY for use at locations where the resources do not support the Java version, e.g., where communications bandwidth is too low or where the browser does not support Java. <p> The forms version is implemented by means of an added gateway that translates between the hub-applet API and standard HTML tags for forms. No changes to the hub or the remainder of the architecture are needed. More details about the forms implementation is available in <ref> [6] </ref>. We would like to note also that a displayless version of WebGALAXY can be implemented within the architectural framework just as easily. 5. CONCLUSION WebGALAXY demonstrates that human language access to resources on the World Wide Web is feasible, albeit in limited application domains.

Reference-contexts: As an example, KTH has demonstrated their text-to-speech (TTS) system, which accepts requests via a Web forms protocol, with our WebGALAXY architecture. 2. GALAXY The WebGALAXY system extends our GALAXY system ([2], <ref> [12] </ref>) to take advantage of the recent developments involving the World Wide Web and the Internet. GALAXY allows speech and natural language access to a variety of online information and services. A distributed client-server architecture is employed.
