Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Albert is an interactive research tool to assist the specialist in the study of nonassociative algebra. This document serves as a technical guide to Albert. We refer the reader to <ref> [1] </ref> for a more casual tutorial. The main problem addressed by Albert is the recognition of polynomial identities. Roughly, Albert works in the following way. Suppose a user wishes to study alternative algebras.
