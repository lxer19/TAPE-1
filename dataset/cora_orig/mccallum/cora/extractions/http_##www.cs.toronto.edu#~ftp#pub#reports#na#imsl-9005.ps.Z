Reference-contexts: Secondary goals for these courses were to sharpen the students' programming skills, and to train them in good computing practices. In previous courses, we used software packages distributed with the popular numerical methods textbooks, as well as mathematical software collected from colleagues and public domain sources such as netlib <ref> (1987) </ref> and ACM TOMS. We feel that exposing students to a comprehensive and sophisticated library, such as the IMSL MATH/LIBRARY, better meets our course objectives. <p> Having chosen the IMSL MATH/LIBRARY, our next task was to select a textbook and appropriate documentation. We first considered Numerical Methods, Software, and Analysis by Rice (1983), but reluctantly decided against using it because that edition is based on the "old" IMSL Library <ref> (before the major revision in 1987) </ref>.
