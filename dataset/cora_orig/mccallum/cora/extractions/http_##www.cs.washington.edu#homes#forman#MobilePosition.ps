Abstract: Applications running in networked mobile computing environments are prone to a great deal of variability in the response time they experience from system services, such as an (implicitly distributed) file system or (explicit) networking. The range of variability is much greater than in traditional computing environments and changes dynamically. Without special programming considerations, such applications will exhibit unacceptable user responsiveness when resources are slow. Therefore, applications need to be flexible about their resource demands if they are to remain usable through periods of degraded service. There exist known techniques to cope with resource variability, including incremental (multi-resolution) processing of results, concurrency, and dynamic resource allocation. However, their programming cost is substantial, and infrastructure support is weak. This raises the need for general-purpose software frameworks and mechanisms to support these techniques.

Reference-contexts: therefore propose an important area for software research: to develop general purpose frameworks that effectively support programmers in building applications that exhibit good responsiveness in volatile, variable-resource environments, e.g., general support for the techniques listed above. 3 The Petra-Flow Framework Here we very briefly summarize one such candidate framework, Petra-Flow <ref> [For96] </ref>. The basic notion is to use futures to expose concurrency, and extend their capabilities to support the incremental delivery of results to their consumers. The framework supplies implicit data management and synchronization for the incremental results, which conceptually pass down through a data-flow graph. <p> Details of the Petra-Flow framework, a C++ implementation on pthreads, and its practical evaluation in three application areas can be found in <ref> [For96] </ref> 4 4 Conclusion We believe that successful applications in the mobile computing environment must offer the user consistently acceptable response time despite tremendously variable underlying service. Mobility and wireless networking cause much of this variability.

Reference-contexts: This is because their use is often as a communicator or information utility, and considering their limited computing resources, it is natural to compensate by employing remote services. This dependence on remote services may be transparent to the application, such as with remote file systems <ref> [Nob95] </ref>, or remote virtual memory paging [Sch91]. 1.2 Challenge to Programming Scaling applications to fit resouce constraints is an old problem. There is an inherent tradeoff between response time and the quality of results presented to the user (amount of work done).
