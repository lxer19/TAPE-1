Abstract: This article describes a method for representing and simulating Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) systems which are imprecise that is, where the ODE model contains both parametric and functional uncertainty. Such models, while useful in engineering tasks such as design and hazard analysis, are not used in practice because they require either special structures which limit the describable uncertainty or produce predictions which are extremely weak. This article describes SQsim (for SemiQuantitative SIMulator), a system which provides a general language for representing and reasoning about many common forms of engineering uncertainty. By defining the model both qualitatively and quantitatively and

Reference-contexts: This field analyzes conditions under which bounds exist for an ODE system. Several algorithms (e.g., [Markov and Angelov, 1986]) follow directly from this work. * The field of differential inclusions <ref> [Aubin and Cellina, 1984] </ref> views the SQDE prediction problem from a framework where state and model uncertainty are directly represented by sets of state-space points and ODE models, respectively, and analyzes conditions under which bounds for the system exists.

Reference-contexts: By simulating from an imprecise initial condition, we maintain the Guaranteed Coverage Property of SQsim and do not "miss" potentially relevant behaviors 9 . 7 Localization is akin to Target Interval Splitting <ref> [Berleant and Kuipers, 1992] </ref> which attempts to refute the ends of intervals. 8 In fact, the values in the table are incorrect since they do not fall inside the guaranteed Q2 envelope.

Reference-contexts: This method yields very precise predictions, but requires very specific model structures and is thus not generally applicable. * Use intervals to bound parameters and use an interval ODE solver to compute predictions <ref> [Corliss, 1995a] </ref>. <p> This class is identical to the class of quasi-monotonic systems [Walter, 1970] for which it can be shown that simulating the corners of the hypercube leads to an optimal bound <ref> [Corliss, 1995a] </ref>. 14 These sources of spurious behavior suggest that we can improve the Nsim prediction by using different uncertainty representations or simulation methods. In Section 5 we will examine some of these possibilities. <p> It is noteworthy because it casts the bounding problem as a set of optimization problems in the state space of the system. This allows it to avoid manipulating state space uncertainty representations, thus sidestepping the correlation problems of most other methods. * The paper by Corliss <ref> [Corliss, 1995a] </ref> describes a variety of other bounding methods for ODE systems and analyzes conditions under which they are applicable. * [Gazi et al., 1997] extends Monte Carlo methods to handle functional as well as parametric uncertainty.

Reference-contexts: Inclusion monotonicity is the property that if X is an interval vector and F (X) is an interval function 12 then if Y X then F (Y ) F (X). Typical algorithms <ref> [Moore, 1979, Corliss, 1995b] </ref> work in two stages: 1. Compute a coarse bound on x (t) over some time interval I = [t j ; t j + h]. Assume that at t j , X (t j ) bounds the trajectory.

Reference-contexts: to the initial values? * Do the trajectories remain inside an acceptable region of the state space? * Where and when do extrema occur in the trajectories of the state variables? * How sensitive is the behavior to uncertainty in model parameters? Our example follows the work of Dalle Molle <ref> [Dalle Molle, 1989] </ref> who made a detailed study of the adiabatic CSTR for the case where the system is in equilibrium and then C Ai is negatively perturbed.

Reference-contexts: Since it 27 is a purely numerical method, it cannot exploit qualitative information about the model to prevent envelope divergence as SQsim does. * The system of Danes <ref> [Danes et al., 1993] </ref> simulates precise models whose inputs are imprecisely-defined and satisfy certain controllability and observability requirements (which means that it can simulate only a subset of the SQDEs that SQsim can).

Reference-contexts: These properties of SQsim make it well-suited for use in design applications [Gazi et al., 1993] (where guaranteed bounds are very useful) as well as for monitoring and diagnosis applications (where covering a large model space helps to reduce the number of candidate models) <ref> [Dvorak and Kuipers, 1989] </ref> . Monitoring applications typically start with a given set of models which are matched against the data.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, it is difficult to represent functional uncertainty with this method. * Represent uncertainty using probability distributions for imprecisely known parameters and use variance propagation methods to make predictions <ref> [Gelb, 1974, Reckhow, 1987] </ref>. This approach fails when the uncertainty cannot be modeled as probabilities (for example, if we have functional uncertainty).

Reference-contexts: Nsim is thus making predictions about models that are not part of the original model space and so these predictions admit spurious states. In some cases, model correlation can be eliminated by rewriting the SQDE so that only one reference to a function is made (see <ref> [Hullermeier, 1995] </ref>). In the above example, we can introduce a new variable z = x + y thus transforming the system into x 0 = c f (x) z 0 = x 0 + y 0 = c g (z x) which makes only one reference to f . <p> In <ref> [Hullermeier, 1995] </ref>, Hullermeier examines SQDE simulation as done by Nsim in this framework and suggests methods for using alternate representations that can sometimes produce better bounds at greater computational expense. There has also been applied work in behavior bounding in the area of VLSI simulation by Zukowski [Zukowski, 1986]. <p> For the purposes of intuition, we prove a slightly weaker version of the theorem in which we assume f i (x) &lt; f i (X) when Condition 4 holds. A complete proof which assumes f i (x) f i (X) is given in [Bothe, 1992] and <ref> [Hullermeier, 1995] </ref>. The bound holds at t 0 by assumption.

Reference-contexts: For some classes of systems (for example, systems with tight feedback), small amounts of parametric uncertainty do not affect the results. For systems with larger amounts of uncertainty or nonlinearities, however, the model-device mismatch may be large. * Use Monte-Carlo analysis <ref> [Kahaner et al., 1989] </ref>. By running repeated simulations of the ODE system using different combinations of parameter values, it is possible to get some idea of the behavior of the models in the model space.

Reference-contexts: We have developed such a method that uses a step-size that fits the numerical properties of the SQDE rather than relying on the distance between qualitative time-points. Our method, called Nsim <ref> [Kay and Kuipers, 1993] </ref>, does this by constructing an ODE system that is guaranteed to bound the behaviors of the SQDE. This system is then simulated to generate a dynamic envelope for all behaviors of the SQDE. <p> clues on how to further improve bounds. 4.3 Other Examples In addition to its application in predicting the behavior of the CSTR, Nsim has also been applied to a variety of other systems, including a model of a semiconductor vacuum system during pump-down that was used in a monitoring system <ref> [Kay, 1991, Kay and Kuipers, 1993] </ref>. Because of the highly nonlinear nature of the model, a small error in modeling can have a large effect on the predicted behavior, and so it is very difficult to accurately predict the dynamic behavior of the system with a precise model.

Reference-contexts: Such a system would first determine QDEs that are consistent with the measurements and then form SQDEs by bounding the monotonic functions with static envelopes and the constants with intervals. Initial work on the former step has been developed in [Richards et al., 1992] and <ref> [Kay and Ungar, 1993] </ref> describes work on the latter step. A key requirement for integrating these tasks is the ability to produce useful predictions from an imprecise model.

Reference-contexts: In the process, some branches of the tree may be refuted because their qualitative descriptions are inconsistent with the quantitative information, while on other branches quantitative information refines the prediction. The Q2 algorithm <ref> [Kuipers and Berleant, 1988] </ref> produces semiquantitative inferences from the SQDE. At each qualitative time-point, QSIM defines events for each variable. An event is the qmag of a variable together with the qmag of the T IM E variable at the time-point.

Reference-contexts: Often, there will be precise information about the structural and qualitative properties of the model, while the numerical information will be imprecise. SQsim makes use of this distinction by using a multi-level representation based on the QSIM <ref> [Kuipers, 1986] </ref> representation for ODE systems. The levels are: * The structural level (SDE). At this level, we describe the form of the ODE system in terms of the state variables and the constraints that link them. Constraints are described as arithmetic operators and functional relationships. <p> Using Kuipers' QSIM algorithm <ref> [Kuipers, 1984, Kuipers, 1986] </ref>, we can simulate the behavior of a QDE.

Reference-contexts: By applying the rules of qualitative arithmetic <ref> [Kuipers, 1994] </ref>, QSIM generates a set of variable descriptions consistent with the model constraints at the initial state. For instance, if x and y are related by a monotonic increasing function, qdir (x) =" implies qdir (y) =".

Reference-contexts: Interval ODE simulators are also susceptible to the effects of ignoring correlations between variables, particularly the wrapping effect. Modern simulators such as AWA <ref> [Lohner, 1988] </ref> minimize this effect by using a coordinate system that that follows the trajectory of the system. AWA does this by producing an approximate solution to the ODE system and using the angle between this solution and the coordinate axes to rotate the frame of reference for computing intervals.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, linearization is required to solve the variance equations which leads to a mismatch be tween the behavior of the true model and its linearization. * Use a specialized model structure that separates the uncertainty from the ODE system <ref> [Lunze, 1989] </ref>. The ODE model and the uncertainty model can be solved separately and then combined to bound the model space.

Reference-contexts: information described in the SQDE, we end up with a set of interval equations that must hold at each time-point. [Figure 3 about here.] Given an initial assignment of ranges to certain landmarks, we can solve the system of equations using propagation of intervals through model constraints using interval mathematics <ref> [Moore, 1979] </ref> 3 . Whenever we find an equation that computes the value of a model variable, we intersect its existing range with the computed one. If their intersection reduces the range, we assert the updated range and follow the consequences of this new, smaller range. <p> As simulation proceeds, this set may include more and more states that are not reachable from the initial state, thus leading to bounds that diverge with time. This is known as the "wrapping problem" in the interval simulation literature <ref> [Moore, 1979] </ref> (see Figure 6). Note that wrapping is the property of any finite representation of a set of states. Depending on the system, is sometimes possible to reduce the effect of wrapping by using other representations such as ellipsoids [Moore, 1979] or by using coordinate transformations that orient the hypercube <p> known as the "wrapping problem" in the interval simulation literature <ref> [Moore, 1979] </ref> (see Figure 6).

Reference-contexts: The practical result is that the extremal system for this system produces tighter bounds than extremal system (1). SQDEs that lead to separable extremal systems have the property that their bounds are determined by simulating "corners" of the hypercube. This class is identical to the class of quasi-monotonic systems <ref> [Walter, 1970] </ref> for which it can be shown that simulating the corners of the hypercube leads to an optimal bound [Corliss, 1995a]. 14 These sources of spurious behavior suggest that we can improve the Nsim prediction by using different uncertainty representations or simulation methods. <p> There is also a large body of theoretical work that provides a formal basis for many bounding methods: * The field of differential inequalities <ref> [Walter, 1970] </ref> has relevance to bounding behaviors of imprecisely-defined ODE systems. This field analyzes conditions under which bounds exist for an ODE system.

When treated as a resistive and capacitive switching network, digital VLSI circuit ODE 28 systems are quasi-monotonic (or nearly so) and so simplified bounding methods can be used to predict circuit behavior by bounding the true circuit equations by linear ones and simulating these.
