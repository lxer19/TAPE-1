Abstract: The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) to show that a particular form of nogood learning, called learning-by-merging, can be used with weak-commitment search to form an effective algorithm for solving a variety of problems; and (ii) to indicate that this algorithm can be used as a basis for developing hybrid algorithms which address a range of hard problems. The basic algorithm is derived from the weak-commitment algorithm (WC) of Yokoo [17], which has been shown to outperform breakout and min-conflict backtracking on certain classes of problems. Weak-commitment search is that part of WC which results from removing the learning mechanism; this will be called WC-NL. WC-NL is coupled with learning-by-merging to form the new algorithm WC-NG. Experiments on a range of problems yield two indicative results: (i) WC-NL and WC-NG always outperform WC, and (ii) for harder problems WC-NG always outperforms WC-NL. It should be noted that for easier problems learning-by-merging never significantly degrades the performance of WC-NL. Forward-checking can be coupled with WC-NG to form one hybrid extension, called WC-NG-FC. Experiments on a range of problems show WC-NG-FC significantly outperforms both WC-FC (WC with forward checking) and WC-NL-FC (WC-NL with forward checking). They also reveal that WC-NG-FC significantly improves on well known benchmarks for certain problem classes. This is interesting since

Reference-contexts: Experiments on the zebra problem reveal that WC-FC and WC-NG-FC outperform WC-NL-FC. Both forms of learning, viz. the learning of WC and learning-by-merging, bring benefits in the context of FC. However, further experiments on hard soluble 3-SAT problems, specified in Asahiro et al <ref> [1] </ref>, show that WC-NG-FC significantly outperforms both WC-NL-FC and WC-FC. WC-FC is by far the worst.

The generation procedure ensures that each problem has exactly one solution. Experiments have shown these problems to be hard to solve for nonsystematic search [Cha & Iwama: 3].

Moreover, the number of constraint checks required by WC-NG-FC is approximately 40% fewer on average than WC-NL-FC. The experiments in Cha & Iwama <ref> [3] </ref> explore GSAT [Selman et al: 15] and a WEIGHT strategy using an equivalent set of single solution 3-SAT problems with 100 variables.

Reference-contexts: Note that WC and WC-NG are both guaranteed to terminate; they are complete algorithms. 3 Experiments 3.1 Graph 3-colourability In Yokoo [19] experiments were reported on the behaviour of WC on graph 3-colourability problems. Graphs with 60 nodes were generated using the method outlined in Minton et al <ref> [9] </ref>. The set of 60 nodes were divided into three roughly equal sets. Arcs between pairs of variables from different groups were generated until the average connectivity of the nodes reached a chosen value. If the resulting graph was not connected the generation procedure was rerun.

Reference-contexts: To investigate whether learning can be used to improve search performance, harder problem sets must be used. The zebra problem Prosser <ref> [11] </ref> has been carefully constructed to have a low solution density and, therefore, relatively difficult to solve. The zebra problem consists of 25 variables each with domains of size 5. A set of 5000 different instances of the zebra problem were generated by randomly choosing different initial complete assignments.

Satisfiable 3-SAT formulae involving 100 variables were constructed by first generating a truth assignment to the set of variables. Each clause of length three was generated by selecting three variables at random, negating each one with probability 0.5 and taking the disjunction of the resulting literals.
