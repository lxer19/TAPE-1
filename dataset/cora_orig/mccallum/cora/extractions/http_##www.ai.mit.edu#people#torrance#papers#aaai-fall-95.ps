Title: Active Notebook: A Personal and Group Productivity Tool for Managing Information  
Author: Mark C. Torrance and 
Address: 545 Technology Square #705 Cambridge, MA 02171  
Affiliation: MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  Sun Microsystems Laboratories  
Abstract: This paper describes Active Notebook, a collection of software tools which work together to allow individuals to label document-based information with conceptual classifications, and organize these documents into a semantic taxonomy for later browsing and retrieval. Tools are also provided to support sharing documents and references with peers. Novel techniques for taxonomy sharing avoid the need for a single, global taxonomy to which everyone adheres. Ongoing work on active reminding is described.

Reference-contexts: In [3], the authors of AGENDA identify many benefits of allowing individual users to structure their own personal taxonomy or hierarchy of categories. Since that time, substantial effort has been spent on designing broadly useful taxonomies, such as CYC [4] and Word-net [5], and on standards such as KIF <ref> [1] </ref> and Ontolin-gua [2] for sharing knowledge among different users and applications.

Reference-contexts: So information processing device would have (at least) three parents: information, processing , and device. While this algorithm introduces some strange axioms, the general effect is positive, and bad axioms can be manually deleted using the Active Notebook taxonomy editor.
