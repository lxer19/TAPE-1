Title: Between-host evolution of mutation-rate and within-host evolution of virulence.

Abstract: It has been recently realized that parasite virulence (the harm caused by parasites to their hosts) can be an adaptive trait. Selection for a particular level of virulence can happen either at at the level of between-host tradeoffs or as a result of short-sighted within-host competition. This paper describes some simulations which study the effect that modifier genes for changes in mutation rate have on suppressing this short-sighted development of virulence, and investigates the interaction between this and a simplified model of im mune clearance.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction. In recent years a challenge <ref> [1, 2] </ref> has been mounted to the "conventional wisdom" that parasites will evolve to a mutualistic relationship with their hosts, where the parasite causes no harm to the host. <p> There are two evolutionary scenarios which could give rise to non-minimal virulence in parasite-host coevolution. The first is between-host selection, where there is a tradeoff between harm caused by the host and some advantage such as increased transmissibility. An easy to understand example <ref> [1] </ref> is the water-borne bacterium Vibrio cholerae which causes cholera. One virulent symptom of cholera, often fatal, is severe diarrhoea, leading to dehydration. However in an environment with poor sanitation this results in infection of the drinking water, leading to increased transmissibility.

Reference-contexts: A closer analysis suggests that intermediate levels of virulence (the harm caused by a parasite to its host) are an active adaptation, not just an accidental artifact. This idea has been supported both theoretically <ref> [3, 4, 5] </ref> and to a lesser degree in real biological systems (e.g. the phage experiments described in [6]). There are two evolutionary scenarios which could give rise to non-minimal virulence in parasite-host coevolution. <p> Once a host has been infected new mutant strains will emerge, and competition for resources within the host may lead to virulent strains emerging [5, 4]. This competition can lead to strains which are less good for long-term transmission| hence the use of the term short-sighted. A simple example <ref> [3] </ref> is where a strain emerges which uses host resources at a rate faster than the current strain, yet at the expense of killing the host faster. If this strain and the milder strain were to circulate freely in the population without mutation, then the milder strain would dominate.

One possibility <ref> [5] </ref> is within-host niche expansion|a parasite normally lives in some part of the host without causing harm, but a runaway (possibly mutant) variant finds a way into another tissue of the host, where it causes harm.

This provides us with a "null model" on which to build other features. 3 A model with clearance. There will of course be other pressures acting on the mutation rate of the parasites <ref> [13] </ref>. Some of these will support the reduced mutation rate, particularly the generation of deleterious mutants ("mutation load"). However in a dynamic environment there is an opposing force ("substitution load") which is the advantage to be gained by evolutionary flexibility in a changing environment. <p> It is also possible that this relationship could be nonlinear, and that these nonlinearities could provide multiple points of stability along the mutation-rate continuum.

Reference-contexts: We know that virulence can evolve by within-host mutation, and we know that selection can act to influence mutation rates. To what extent will between-host selection choose to alter parasite mutation rates to reduce the chance of a short-sighted mutant appearing? We use an individual-based model <ref> [15] </ref> of a freely-mixing host population with parasites of varying degrees of virulence being transmitted between them. This individual-based model allows a simulation of a complex heterogeneous population.

Reference-contexts: This has been a simple analysis of a complex problem, and several variations and enhancements suggest themselves. A more realistic host population would have various social structures, and an attempt to incorporate these structures (modelled, for example, by the methods described in <ref> [17] </ref>) into a model of virulence evolution would be an interesting future study. Another factor which is worthy of further study is kin selection within the parasite population [18]. There is also interest in combining these models with more accurate models of host response.

A more immediate and tractable problem is modelling the immune response in a more realistic way. It is unlikely that appropriate modifiers will exist in all cases. In this case we can calculate conditions on the (ecological and epidemiological) parameters such that short-sighted evolution will persist in a population.
