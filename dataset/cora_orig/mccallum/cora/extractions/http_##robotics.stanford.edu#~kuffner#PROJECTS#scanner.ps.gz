Reference-contexts: One primary source of information about various methods is given in a survey by Paul Besl <ref> [1] </ref>. Other more recent sources include papers by Curless [2] and Dorsch [3] which detail some of the limits to the accuracy of triangulation methods. The major issues I will briefly discuss below.

The major issues I will briefly discuss below. <p> A few of the alternatives to the maximum pixel value method include using the mean, the median, or fitting a one-dimensional Gaussian distribution to the intensity data on each scanline, and using the mean of the Gaussian as the center point. Curless <ref> [2] </ref> uses a spacetime analysis in order to achieve good results even when the object's surface reflectance varies.

Reference-contexts: There are a number of ways of dealing with this problem, including scanning the object from an angle which will minimize or eliminate occlusions. Others have devised methods of combining the results of several scans to produce the full object geometry <ref> [6] </ref>. In Section 4: Mesh Generation, I explain further how my software deals with occlusions.
