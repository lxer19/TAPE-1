Abstract: In the last decade fuzzy control (FC) has become a very popular control paradigm. Nowadays fuzzy controllers are very successful in a wide range of application domains and the market for such FC applications is still expanding. Nevertheless, the theoretical framework of FC is far beyond its practical success. While many convincing applications justify Mamdani's original FC design, from a theoretical point of view there is still a simple question to be answered: Why is FC working? And to answer this question is not only a task to satisfy theorists but also a matter of practice. That is, to give FC a sound theoretical background means to answer a very important related question, namely: When is FC working? In which contexts may we expect FC to work properly and how should we prepare the controller inputs and interpret the given results? In this paper we introduce a complete and sound framework to explain the most common FC mechanism, Mamdani's original approach. We present the idea of oe-distributions, which is a concept somewhat dual to possibility theory, and prove that regarding fuzzy sets as oe-distributions means to postulate FC in the sense of Mamdani. We point out that dealing with oe-distributions is based on dissonant bodies of evidence and therefore not the same as the use of possibility theory. Furthermore, with respect to incomplete or inconsistent knowledge both approaches show complementary characteristics, which is a very important observation from a practical point of view.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, we denote the generic elements of U x and U y by u and v, respectively. Definition 1 A fuzzy set ~ A is called a (fuzzy) subset of universe U iff its membership function A has domain U : A : U ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. We denote this relation briefly by ~ A ae U . <p> For further details we reference to <ref> [1, 9, 15] </ref>, e.g. On the other hand, it has already been mentioned, that there is an inference mechanism that is by far the most common one: SFC, the mechanism presented in 1975 by Mamdani and Assilian [10]. <p> The same applies to maximization, naturally. 3 Actually, within the SFC framework the FITA and FATI approach make no difference, since ffi is distributive over [. Definition 3 A possibility distribution (on U x ) is a mapping x : U x ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; that describes our imprecise knowledge on the real value of variable x by the following semantics: x (u) states the degree, to which we consider the assumption x = u to be possible. <p> Any distribution 0 x with 0 x &lt; x is more precise than allowed by the knowledge 1 x . With (joint) possibility distributions x 1 ;:::;x n : U x 1 fi fi U x n ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> we can express vague knowledge about relations between several variables x 1 to x n , as well: For instance, x;y (u; v) states the degree, to which we consider the assumption (x; y) = (u; v), i.e. both x = u and y = v, to be possible <p> Given a joint possibility distribution, say x;y , we may also be interested in the meaning of this distribution on the separated variables x or y, respectively. Definition 6 The projection [ x;y # U x ] of the possibility distribution x;y : U x fi U y ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> on U x is defined by [ x;y # U x ] : U x ! [0; 1] v2U y This is, in order to calculate the projection [ x;y # U x ] of the joint distribution x;y on U x we assume to know nothing about the <p> Definition 6 The projection [ x;y # U x ] of the possibility distribution x;y : U x fi U y ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> on U x is defined by [ x;y # U x ] : U x ! [0; 1] v2U y This is, in order to calculate the projection [ x;y # U x ] of the joint distribution x;y on U x we assume to know nothing about the real value of y. <p> We now introduce the new concept of oe-distributions in order to infer SFC using a derivation very similar to the one presented above. A oe-distribution oe x : U x ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> specifies our imprecise knowledge on the state of variable x from a different point of view than a possibility distribution, i.e. under a different interpretation: Definition 7 A oe-distribution (on U x ) is a mapping oe x : U x ! [0; 1]; that describes our imprecise knowledge <p> oe x : U x ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> specifies our imprecise knowledge on the state of variable x from a different point of view than a possibility distribution, i.e. under a different interpretation: Definition 7 A oe-distribution (on U x ) is a mapping oe x : U x ! [0; 1]; that describes our imprecise knowledge on the real value of variable x by the following semantics: oe x (u) states the degree, to which the assumption x = u is supported by the available knowledge. <p> Following definition 7, with oe x;y being a joint oe-distribution oe x;y : U x fi U y ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; oe x;y (u; v) states the degree, to which the assumption (x; y) = (u; v) is supported by the available knowledge. oe x;y (u; v) quantifies the degree of support, that at the same time it holds x = u and y = v. <p> We define: Definition 9 The projection [oe x;y # U x ] of the oe-distribution oe x;y : U x fi U y ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> on U x is defined by [oe x;y # U x ] : U x ! [0; 1] v2U y This is, in order to get the degree of support [oe x;y # U x ](u) for the assumption x = u we have to be pessimistic: since oe <p> We define: Definition 9 The projection [oe x;y # U x ] of the oe-distribution oe x;y : U x fi U y ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> on U x is defined by [oe x;y # U x ] : U x ! [0; 1] v2U y This is, in order to get the degree of support [oe x;y # U x ](u) for the assumption x = u we have to be pessimistic: since oe x;y tells us nothing about the state of the variable y, y may take any value v 2 <p> Now, we come back to the inference mechanism of a rule based system, this time by means of oe-distributions. Assuming oe x := A , a oe-distribution oe x : U x ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is just another way to interpret the fuzzy predicate "x is ~ A". <p> To check the details that are very briefly presented in this section we refer to [13], [8], and [16]. Again, we start by presenting some well known facts about possibility distributions. Whenever x is normalized , there is a bijective mapping between possibility distributions x : U x ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and possibility measures x : 2 U x ! [0; 1] by means of 8u 2 U x : x (u) := x (fug); (28) u2A [13]. <p> Again, we start by presenting some well known facts about possibility distributions. Whenever x is normalized , there is a bijective mapping between possibility distributions x : U x ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and possibility measures x : 2 U x ! [0; 1] by means of 8u 2 U x : x (u) := x (fug); (28) u2A [13]. <p> In order to find a dual relationship between oe-distributions and a corresponding fuzzy measure, we recapitulate the concept of a body of evidence: Definition 16 A function m x : 2 U x ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is called a body of evidence (basic assignment) if m x (;) = 0 and AU x m x (A) quantifies our degree of belief that the real value of variable x is contained in the set A U x , but not in any subset A 0 A. <p> The absolute values of any oe-distribution derived never have any particular meaning. All the defuzzification techniques, for instance, yield the same result applied to any s oe x , no matter which value in (0; 1] is assigned to s. In fact, the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref> of possibility and oe-distributions is just an ordinal scale [11]. This is also verified by the observation, that there is only minimization and maximization used to manipulate possibility or support degrees.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Based on his pioneer paper [19] L.A. Zadeh initiated the still lasting era of fuzzy control (FC) in 1973 [20, 21]. The first application of fuzzy set theory to control is reported by Mamdani and Assilian in 1975 <ref> [10] </ref>. Their heuristic method turned out to be very successful, efficient, and easy to desribe, and therefore the vast majority of FC applications is using this method. For that reason we call it standard fuzzy control (SFC). <p> For further details we reference to [1, 9, 15], e.g. On the other hand, it has already been mentioned, that there is an inference mechanism that is by far the most common one: SFC, the mechanism presented in 1975 by Mamdani and Assilian <ref> [10] </ref>. We are convinced that this approach originally was a purely heuristic one that has been developed without thinking in terms of implication relations and s-t composition. <p> Assuming nothing but the simple semantics of oe-distributions we infer the most common fuzzy control mechanism, Mamdani's standard fuzzy control (SFC) <ref> [10] </ref>. This is a very important result, since, at least from our point of view, the theoretical background of SFC was not very convincing. SFC worked in many applications, but there was no completely satisfying explanation, why and when SFC should be used.
