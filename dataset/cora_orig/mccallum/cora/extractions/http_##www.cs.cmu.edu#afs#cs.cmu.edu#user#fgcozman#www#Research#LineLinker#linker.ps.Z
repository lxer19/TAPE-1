Abstract: This report describes a line linker based on tools of Frequentist Statistics: Chi-square significance testing and the Akaike Information Criterion. The line linker has been implemented as an AVS T M module and is available as freeware. This report describes the basic facts about the distributed linker and its use. c fl1996 Carnegie Mellon University

Reference-contexts: Two lines are associated if they must be considered parts of a single line even though there is an intersection or a gap between them (Figure 4). The algorithm tries to associate two lines l 1 and l 2 by comparing the Akaike Information Criterion <ref> [1] </ref> of the lines as separate entities and as a single entity.

Reference-contexts: A classic tool for line linking is the Hough Transform, which returns a list of line segments without connectivity information <ref> [2] </ref>. A different approach uses algorithms that search of lines through a maze of edgels, recovering connectivity information in the process [6, 8].

Reference-contexts: For example, the Markov field image representation of Geman and Geman leads to an iterative solution for line linking using Gibbs sampling [5]. The computational cost of Markov field models may be prohibitively high. A different idea is championed by Cox, Rehg and Hingorani <ref> [4] </ref>. In their model, all lines in the image can be modeled by linear dynamical systems subject to random disturbances. They look for best lines by applying Bayes' rule to a number of line candidates. Since the number of candidates may grow exponentially, they use heuristics to terminate some candidates.

A different approach uses algorithms that search of lines through a maze of edgels, recovering connectivity information in the process <ref> [6, 8] </ref>. A complete line linker must also make decisions at intersections and at gaps: should neighboring lines be merged? For example, Pavlidis and Horowitz's algorithm [7] contains splitting and merging steps in line linking that address all these problems.
