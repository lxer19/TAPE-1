Abstract: The geometric point set matching problem in 2 and 3 dimensions is a well-studied problem with application to areas such as computer vision and pattern recognition, computational chemistry and other fields such as cartography and computer animation. The basic problems can be formulated as follows. Given some choice of a space of transformations and a similarity measure d(P; Q) for two point sets P and Q in Euclidean space. Problem 2 (Largest Common Point-set (LCP)) Given point sets P and Q, where jP j = m and jQj = n, K &gt; 0 and * &gt; 0, find a transformation T and a set P 0 P of size jP 0 j K such that jd(T (P 0 ); Q)j * or return none if no such T and P 0 exist. We restrict T to the space of rigid Euclidean translations and rotations. The similarity measures of interest to us are: the exact metric 1 d E (P; Q) (binary-valued, requiring each point in P to be mapped to a point in Q); the Hausdorff metric d H (P; Q) (maximum over all points in P of the distance to the nearest point in Q); and, the matching metric d M (bottleneck matching distance). A detailed study of this set of problems was initiated by Alt, Mehlhorn, Wagener, and Welzl [AMWW88]. In this seminal work, they propose a suite of algorithms for the exact and matching metrics. More recent work led to improved bounds for pattern matching and LCP under the exact metric. The problem of estimating the minimum Hausdorff distance between two point sets in 2 and 3 dimensions has been studied extensively. Clearly, any real application of such algorithms has to deal with the presence of noise in data, requiring the algorithms to perform matching within the limits of some reasonable noise model. In fact, our interest in these problems arose during an attempt to implement such algorithms for applications in computer vision and in computational biology and chemistry, particularly rational drug design [FKL + 97]. We discovered that noise present in real data rendered most known algorithms inoperative. In hindsight, this is not surprising for, as noted in the survey by Alt and Guibas [AG96], these algorithms are likely to be "difficult to implement and numerically unstable due to the necessary computation of intersections of complex algebraic surfaces." Worse still, they have unacceptably high running times: for example, even in R 2 , LCP under the matching metric requires O(n 8 ) time, although under additional restrictions on noise regions the running times can be y Supported by NSF Award CCR-9357849, with matching funds from IBM, Mitsubishi, Schlumberger Foundation, Shell Foundation, and Xerox Corporation. z Supported by an Alfred P.

Reference-contexts: They enable us to give better estimate of the running time of above techniques when presented with practical data and are supported by a new technique for traversing the transformation space based on a recent algorithm for combinatorial subset matching by Cole and Hariharan <ref> [CH97] </ref>. This technique allows us to improve significantly the running times of our pattern matching algorithms as it eliminates the cost of potential match verification. To our knowledge, this is the first application of combinatorial pattern matching techniques to geometric point set matching.

Reference-contexts: In order to achieve our results, we establish several combinatorial bounds for multiplicities of occurrence (within noise limits) of distances and triangles in point sets in &lt; 2 and &lt; 3 . These results complement and generalize a problem first addressed by Erdos, Makai, Pach and Spencer <ref> [EMPS91] </ref> and may be of independent interest.

Reference-contexts: Such algorithms are commonly used in model-based object recognition systems, and geometric hashing has also been applied to molecular surface recognition. Despite the popularity of these schemes, there has been little or no rigorous analysis of the underlying algorithms. Exceptions include the work of Goodrich,Mitchell and Orletsky <ref> [GMO94] </ref> who present simple alignment-based schemes for approximating the minimum Hausdorff distance between point sets and analyse their complexity as well as the estimation error.
