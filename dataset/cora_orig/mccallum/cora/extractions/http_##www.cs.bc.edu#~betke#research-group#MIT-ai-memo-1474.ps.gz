Abstract: We introduce a new learning problem: learning a graph by piecemeal search, in which the learner must return every so often to its starting point (for refueling, say). We present two linear-time piecemeal-search algorithms for learning city-block graphs: grid graphs with rectangular obstacles. This report describes research done at the Center for Biological and Computational Learning and the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Reference-contexts: For example, the learner might be a security guard robot, a taxi driver, or a trail guide. Exploration of unknown environments has been addressed by many previous authors, such as Papadim-itriou and Yanakakis <ref> [1] </ref>, Blum, Raghavan, and Schieber [2], Rivest and Schapire [4], Deng and Pa-padimitriou [5], Betke [6], Deng, Kameda, and Papadim-itriou [7], Rao, Kareti, Shi and Iyengar [11], and Bar-Eli, Berman, Fiat, and Yan [8]. <p> A 1 fi 1 face might correspond to a standard city block; larger faces might correspond to obstacles (parks or shopping malls). Figure 1 gives an example. City-block graphs are also studied by Papadimitriou and Yanakakis <ref> [1] </ref>, Blum, Ragha-van, and Schieber [2], and Bar-Eli, Berman, Fiat and Yan [8].

An m fi n city-block graph with no obstacles has exactly mn vertices (at points (i; j) for 1 i m, 1 j n) and 2mn (m + n) edges (between points at distance 1 from each other).

Reference-contexts: and BFS A simple approach to piecemeal search on arbitrary undi-rected graphs is to use an ordinary search algorithm| breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS)| and just interrupt the search as needed to return to visit s. (Detailed descriptions of BFS and DFS can be found in algorithms textbooks <ref> [3] </ref>.) Once the learner has returned to s, it goes back to the vertex at which search was interrupted and resumes exploration. In depth-first search, edges are explored out of the most recently discovered vertex v that still has unexplored edges leaving it.

Reference-contexts: The off-line piecemeal search problem is similar to the well-known Chinese Postman Problem <ref> [9] </ref>, but where the postman must return to the post-office every so often. (We could call the off-line problem the Weak Postman Problem, for postmen who cannot carry much mail.) The 2 same problem arises when many postmen must cover the same city with their routes. <p> The Chinese Postman Problem can be solved by a polynomial time algorithm if the graph is either undi-rected or directed <ref> [9] </ref>. The Chinese Postman problem for a mixed graph that has undirected and directed edges was shown to be NP-complete by Papadimitriou [10]. We do not know an optimal off-line algorithm for the Weak Postman Problem; this may be an NP-hard problem. This is an interesting open problem.
