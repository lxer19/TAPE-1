Title: Course Offering Spring '94 IEOR 269: Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization  
Author: Instructor: Prof. Dorit S. 
Note: Time: TTh 3:30-5:00 433 Latimer Prerequisite: IEOR 262A 3 Units  
Address: CCN# 42384  
Affiliation: Hochbaum  
Abstract: This course is concerned with discrete optimization problems, their application, complexity and methods for obtaining effective solutions to such problems. The purpose of the course is to provide students with skills for recognizing the difficulty of particular discrete problems and to identify certain algorithmic tools that could be useful in devising algorithms for such problems. There will be two exams a midterm and a final. Both will be take home exams. The midterm contributes 50% towards the final grade, and the final 45%. There is also a required assignment (biweekly). Note taking (scribe, using Latex) for up to two lectures during the semester is a requirement. The quality of the notes and the assignments contribute 5% towards the final grade.

Reference-contexts: As mentioned before, the implicit use of duality is included only to facilitate analysis. In the next class we will see another algorithm of Chvatal <ref> [1] </ref> that also uses duality in this manner and results in a different approximation bound.

Reference-contexts: In addition, for the vertex cover problem it is possible to solve the linear programming relaxation by applying a max-flow min-cut algorithm which is more efficient than solving the respective linear program. 2 The feasible dual approach Bar-Yehuda and Even <ref> [2] </ref> devised an efficient algorithm for identifying a maximal feasible dual solution to be used in the LP-algorithm. As before, the derivation of the dual solution is implicit and exists only in order to analyze the approximation factor.
