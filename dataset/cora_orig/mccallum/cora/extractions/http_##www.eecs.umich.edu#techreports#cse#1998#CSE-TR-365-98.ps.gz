Abstract: We propose and study a scalable flow-control algorithm for multicast ABR (Available Bit Rate) service. A key idea behind the algorithm is the Soft-Synchronization Protocol (SSP), which derives a single "consolidated" RM (Resource Management) cell at each multicast branch-point from feedback RM-cells of different downstream branches that are not necessarily responses to the same forward RM-cell in each synchronization cycle. Using balanced and unbalanced binary-tree models, we analyze the scalability of SSP in terms of height and structure of the multicast tree. In contrast with the other existing schemes, SSP is shown to be able to effectively support synchronization of feedback RM-cells and make the effective RM-cell roundtrip delay virtually independent of the multicast-tree's height and structure, thus making it scalable. Another key problem in multicast flow-control is how to deal with the variation of RM-cell roundtrip delay due to the randomly drifting bottleneck in a multicast tree. This problem is handled by adapting the second-order rate-control parameter to roundtrip-delay variations. Using a fluid model, we derive an analytical relationship between the second-order rate parameter and RM-cell roundtrip delay subject to both lossless transmission and finite buffer capacity constraints. This relationship ensures the feasibility of the second-order rate control in dealing with RM-cell roundtrip-delay variations and provides an insight on how the required buffer space can be controlled by adjusting the rate parameter. We develop an optimal control condition, under which the second-order rate control guarantees monotonic convergence of the system state to the optimal regime from an arbitrary initial value. The proposed second-order rate-control algorithm is also shown to be feasible and optimal in buffer-allocation efficiency and fairness at the bottleneck.

Reference-contexts: Supporting multicast ABR service poses a number of new challenges unseen in the unicast ABR context. One of the major problems, especially in large multicast trees, is commonly known as the feedback implosion problem <ref> [1] </ref>. Since our goal is to adjust the source transmission rate to match the bottleneck link bandwidth, the source needs to collect congestion information all branches in the multicast tree. Simultaneous congestion feedbacks from all branches can cause an implosion at the source.

Reference-contexts: The flow-control scheme should also be able to detect and remove non-responsive or over-congested branches in order to prevent them from stalling the entire multicast connection. Although the literature on unicast ABR is extremely rich, the results on multicast ABR flow control is quite limited. Roberts <ref> [2, 3] </ref> proposed a multicast flow-control scheme which is based on EPRCA (Explicit Proportional Rate Control Algorithm) and extends unicast to multicast operations. Using a similar technique, the authors of [4-6] established a framework for extending an existing unicast congestion-control protocol to a multicast environment.

Reference-contexts: A forward RM-cell is sent by the root (source) periodically or once every N rm data-cells, and each leaf node (receiver) replies by returning to the source a feedback RM-cell with EFCI and ER (Explicit Rate) information. We redefine the RM-cell format <ref> [7] </ref> such that it contains both the cell-rate (first-order) and the rate-parameter (second-order) control information. More specifically, two new one-bit fields, BCI (Buffer Congestion Indication) and NMQ (New Maximum Queue), are defined.
