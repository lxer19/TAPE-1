Reference-contexts: The usual approach for identifying distantly related homologs is to search a database with a sequence using FASTA <ref> [4] </ref> or BLAST [5]. However, as databases increase in size, such searches tend to miss the more distantly related homologs because of the noise from unrelated proteins having a random similarity to the sequence being searched.

Reference-contexts: Sensitivity can be increased by using the information from several homologous proteins to construct a composite of conserved regions for database searching <ref> [6, 7, 8] </ref>. In this approach, homologous sequences are aligned, conserved motifs are identified and an amino acid profile or log-odds matrix for each motif is calculated. <p> The model is linear, and each hidden state in the model corresponds to one or more adjacent amino acids in the protein family being modeled. In a Meta-MEME hidden Markov model, motif regions are modeled without insert states, so the motifs are similar to gapless profiles <ref> [6] </ref>. Spacer regions between motifs can be of variable length. The six strongest motifs in the set of thirty-seven divergent dehydrogenase sequences are determined using MEME 2.0.

Reference-contexts: To address these problems, we have developed an automated method for constructing motifs called Multiple Expectation-maximization for Motif Elicitation (MEME) <ref> [9, 10] </ref>. This method can analyze large datasets in this paper we use thirty-seven dehydrogenase sequences using a statistical algorithm called expectation-maximization [11]. MEME discovers a set of motifs that describe the given group of related sequences. <p> Using a dataset of thirty-seven dehydrogenases, we find that Meta-MEME is a sensitive, selective and convenient tool for identifying distantly related homologs in databases, which should prove useful for subsequent analysis of their structure, function and evolution. 2 Methods The details of the MEME algorithm have been described elsewhere <ref> [9, 10] </ref>. Briefly, MEME uses the expectation-maximization algorithm [11] to disover conserved regions, or motifs, in a dataset of protein sequences. The algorithm uses a heuristic criterion function based on a maximum likelihood ratio test to compare candidate motifs. <p> MEME outputs models of conserved regions in rank order, with the strongest motif represented by the first model. For the analyses reported here, we use MEME version 2.0 with the minimum width set at 12 amino acids and the Dirichlet mixture prior <ref> [9, 10] </ref>. The training set consists of the thirty-seven sequences shown in Table 1 with their SWISSPROT codes. Pairwise alignments of almost all of these sequences are less than 30% identical after using gaps and insertions to maximize identities [17, 22, 23].

Reference-contexts: This is consistent with an absence of extra loops in these proteins and a common 3D structure. An interesting exception is carbonyl reductase, in which the six motifs span 228 residues due to an insertion of 41 residues between motifs 4 and 2 <ref> [41] </ref>. This insertion does not compromise the analysis. Meta-MEME output is useful in identifying the region where a distantly homologous protein has diverged from the dataset. For example, Drosophila immigrans alcohol dehydrogenase has a score of 90.6 bits based on residues 14-85 of the template. <p> We show some high scoring sequences that contain all 85 residues in the six motifs. In 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, these map to residues 8-188 with a score of 178.7. In carbonyl reductase <ref> [41] </ref>, these map to residues 8 235 with a ascore of 127.7. Motif residues 14-82 map to residues 86-188 on Drosophila immigrans alcohol dehydrogenase with a score of 90.6.

Reference-contexts: Comparisons of protein 3D structures is the most sensitive method for determining homology <ref> [50] </ref>, which we propose explains the excellent ability of HMM to separate homologs from noise as seen in Figure 3. In summary, the combination of HMM and MEME into the Meta-MEME tool provides a sensitive and selective method for homology searches to identify distantly related proteins.
