Abstract: Five procedures of mixed finite element type for solving elliptic partial differential equations on triangular meshes are presented: the standard and hybrid mixed methods, the recently introduced expanded mixed method, and two new methods. The efficient implementation of these procedures using the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas approximating spaces defined on triangular elements is discussed. The standard method yields a saddle-point linear system, and while the hybrid method yields a positive definite linear system, it uses 50% more unknowns. A quadrature rule is given which reduces a new, expanded formulation of the mixed method to a finite difference method on triangles. This approach substantially reduces the complexity of the mixed finite element matrix. On smooth meshes this new approach appears to be as accurate as the standard method; on non-smooth meshes it can lose accuracy. An enhancement of this method is derived which combines numerical quadrature with Lagrange multipliers on certain element edges. The enhanced method regains the accuracy of the solution, with little additional cost if the mesh geometry is piece-wise smooth, as in hierarchical meshes. Numerical examples in two dimensions are given comparing the accuracy of the methods. 1. Introduction. In this paper, we discuss several variations of the mixed finite

Reference-contexts: Convergence and superconvergence estimates can be found, for example, in [19, 8, 16, 23, 10, 11]. Since the standard MM yields a linear system that represents a saddle-point problem, much current research on the MM involves how to efficiently solve the system of equations that arises, see for example, <ref> [13, 5, 6, 12, 21, 17, 1] </ref>. Perhaps the earliest successful technique was the hybrid form of the mixed method (HM) [3]. <p> The resulting matrix problem is definite and generally much easier to solve than the problem which arises using the standard mixed method without quadrature. Recently, a variation of the mixed method <ref> [1, 2] </ref> has been developed which has advantages over the standard approach for tensor and positive semi-definite coefficients K. In this method, an auxiliary variable is introduced to avoid inverting K, allowing K to be nonnegative | the standard mixed method assumes K is strictly positive. <p> We refer to this approach as the AWYM (Arbogast-Wheeler-Yotov method); convergence and superconvergence results are given in <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. In this paper, we derive a quadrature rule for triangular elements which reduces the expanded mixed method to a finite difference method for potential. In two dimensions, the finite difference stencil has ten points. <p> The rest of this paper is outlined as follows. In the next Section, we give notation used throughout the paper. For completeness, we review the basic MM [19] in Section 3, the HM [3, 4] in Section 4, and the AWYM <ref> [1, 2] </ref> in Section 5. After this introductory material, we define the "cell-centered stencil method" (SM) in Section 6, which is the triangular analog of the AWYM. It is useful for smoothly triangulated domains. <p> The disadvantage is that (33) involves 50% more unknowns than (20), and in three dimensions, this ratio is 2:1 for tetrahedra and 3:1 for bricks. Fig. 1. Stencil for for the HM 5. The AWY Expanded Mixed Method. In this section, we present the Arbogast-Wheeler-Yotov variation of the MM <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. We introduce a mesh-dependent function S g , which we define explicitly below. For now, assume S g is a symmetric, positive definite, 2fi2 matrix function. <p> In the case of rectangular 8 T. ARBOGAST, C.N. DAWSON, AND P.T. KEENAN elements, however, we can choose S g I, the identity matrix, and the integrals in (43) can be approximated by quadrature rules as in the MM, reducing S to a diagonal matrix <ref> [1] </ref>. Thus, like A mm , A awym becomes a sparse, banded matrix. Another advantage of the AWYM over the MM is that this reduction can be applied even when K is a matrix function, since K does not enter into the computation of S. <p> This reduction is especially useful, for example, in transport equations where K represents a diffusion-dispersion tensor. The convergence theory for the AWYM is given in <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, where it is shown that pressure and velocity are globally first order accurate, and pressures are superconver-gent at the center of mass of each element, provided that S g varies smoothly over the domain.

Convergence and superconvergence estimates can be found, for example, in <ref> [19, 8, 16, 23, 10, 11] </ref>. Since the standard MM yields a linear system that represents a saddle-point problem, much current research on the MM involves how to efficiently solve the system of equations that arises, see for example, [13, 5, 6, 12, 21, 17, 1]. <p> If one uses the RT 0 approximating spaces on rectangular elements and applies appropriate quadrature rules, the mixed method reduces to a five-point cell-centered finite difference method for the potential p. Based on this observation, Weiser and Wheeler <ref> [23] </ref> were able to analyze and prove superconvergence for the potential and velocity approximations generated by this method. The resulting matrix problem is definite and generally much easier to solve than the problem which arises using the standard mixed method without quadrature. <p> As mentioned in the Introduction, in the special case of rectangular elements and K a scalar or a diagonal matrix function, then applying the appropriate quadrature rules to (13) reduces M and M 1 to diagonal matrices without reducing the accuracy of the approximate solutions <ref> [23] </ref>. <p> For rectangular meshes and K a scalar or diagonal matrix, superconvergence of order h 2 of the velocity U and potential P at Gauss points was proven in [16]. These results were extended in [10] to demonstrate superconvergence of velocities along lines connecting Gauss points. In <ref> [23] </ref>, these results were shown to hold even when numerical quadrature of the type discussed above is used to approximate the integral (K 1 v j ; v i ).
