Title: A Lower Bound for Sorting Networks Based on the Shu*e Permutation  
Author: C. Greg Plaxton Torsten Suel 
Address: Austin  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Sciences University of Texas at  
Abstract: We prove an (lg 2 n= lg lg n) lower bound for the depth of n-input sorting networks based on the shu*e permutation. The best previously known lower bound was the trivial (lg n) bound, while the best upper bound is given by Batcher's fi(lg 2 n)-depth bitonic sorting network. The proof technique employed in the lower bound argument may be of independent interest.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A variety of different classes of sorting networks has been described in the literature. Of particular interest here are the so-called AKS network <ref> [1] </ref> discovered by Ajtai, Komlos and Szemeredi, and the sorting networks proposed by Batcher [2]. The AKS network is the only known sorting network with O (lg n) depth. <p> The AKS network is the only known sorting network with O (lg n) depth. However, the topology of the network is highly irregular, and the multiplicative constant hidden by the O-notation is impractically large <ref> [1, 11] </ref>. On the other hand, the networks proposed by Batcher have a relatively simple interconnection structure and a small constant. This makes them the networks of choice in many practical applications, although they have depth fi (lg 2 n) and are thus asymptotically inferior to AKS.

Reference-contexts: This situation has motivated attempts to construct O (lg n)-depth sorting networks with simpler, more regular topologies, and/or a considerably smaller constant. For sorting networks based on Shellsort with monotonically decreasing increments, this question was answered in the negative by Cypher <ref> [3] </ref>, who shows an (lg 2 n= lg lg n) lower bound for this class of networks.

Reference-contexts: In this context, Cypher <ref> [4] </ref> has shown that any emulation of the AKS network on the cube-connected cycles takes time (lg 2 n). Here, we say that a sorting algorithm emulates the AKS network if it performs the same sequence of comparisons.

Reference-contexts: network is based on the shu*e permutation if i = holds for all i. 2 In this paper, we show an (lg 2 n= lg lg n) lower bound for the class of networks based on the shu*e permutation, thereby answering a question posed by Knuth (see Problem 5.3.4.47 of <ref> [5] </ref>), up to a fi (lg lg n) factor. The best previously known lower bound for this class was the trivial (lg n) bound, while the best known upper bound continues to be given by Batcher's fi (lg 2 n)-depth bitonic sorting network.

Reference-contexts: Both delta networks and reverse delta networks can be seen as generalizations of the butterfly network, which is known to be equivalent to a shu*e-based network of depth lg n (e.g., see <ref> [7, Section 3.8] </ref>). More precisely, the butterfly network is the unique network that is both a delta network and a reverse delta network [6].

Reference-contexts: Interestingly, the result cannot be extended to the case where both the shu*e permutation and the unshu*e operation 1 are allowed in the network. For that case, the "randomized" construction of Leighton and Plaxton <ref> [8] </ref> has been shown to imply the existence of sorting networks (in the usual, deterministic sense) with nearly logarithmic depth [12]. <p> This compares to an upper bound of O (lg n f (n)) obtained by a straightforward emulation of the AKS network. Leighton and Plaxton <ref> [8] </ref> have designed a shu*e-unshu*e comparator network (i.e., a comparator network in which the permutation between successive levels can be either shu*e or unshu*e) of depth O (lg n) that sorts all but a superpolynomially small fraction of the inputs. <p> A similar argument can be used to show that we cannot hope to extend the lower bound to the "randomized" complexity of shu*e-based sorting networks. In order to construct a randomized shu*e-unshu*e network that sorts all inputs with high probability, Leighton and Plaxton <ref> [8] </ref> use an additional "randomizing" circuit element that interchanges the input values with probability 1=2, and leaves them unchanged otherwise. This new element can be used to construct a shu*e-based randomized sorter of depth O (lg n lg lg n). <p> Since this would contradict our lower bound, we can conclude that there does not exist a representative set of polynomial size. This argument can be strengthened somewhat. The technique of Leighton and Plax-ton <ref> [8] </ref> can also be used to construct a o (lg 2 n= lg lg n)-depth shu*e-based sorting network that sorts all but an * = 2 2 o (lg n= lg lg n) fraction of the inputs.

Reference-contexts: Recall that we allowed both comparators and switching elements in our network.

Thus, eliminating the permutations between the reverse delta networks would only increase the depth of the circuit by at most a constant factor. A comparator network fl was identified with a mapping from the set of inputs to the set of outputs.

Reference-contexts: For that case, the "randomized" construction of Leighton and Plaxton [8] has been shown to imply the existence of sorting networks (in the usual, deterministic sense) with nearly logarithmic depth <ref> [12] </ref>. Thus, one way of viewing the lower bound of this paper is that it establishes a non-trivial separation between the power of "ascend-descend" machines (e.g., the shu*e-exchange when both shu*ing and unshu*ing are permitted) and strict "ascend" machines (e.g., shu*e only). <p> Assuming the existence of a representative set of polynomial size, and using Corollary 4.2.1 of <ref> [12] </ref>, the existence of an O (lg n lg lg n)-depth shu*e-based network for sorting all but a polynomially small fraction of the inputs implies the existence of a o (lg 2 n= lg lg n)-depth shu*e-based sorting network.
