Title: GLOBAL CONVERGENCE OF DESCENT PROCESSES FOR SOLVING NON STRICTLY MONOTONE VARIATIONAL INEQUALITIES  
Author: P. Marcotte and D. Zhu 
Date: June 1993 Revised June 1994  
Abstract: This paper addresses the question of global convergence of descent processes for solving monotone variational inequalities defined on compact subsets of R n . The approach applies to a large class of methods that includes Newton, Jacobi and linearized Jacobi methods as special cases. Furthermore, strict monotonicity of the cost mapping is not required. Keywords. Descent methods. Variational inequalities. Global convergence.

Reference-contexts: Let us take (u; v; ff) = 1 2 ku vk 2 : This corresponds to the standard projection method which, for this example, is well-known not to converge to the unique solution (0; 0) T , for any value of the parameter ff (see <ref> [2] </ref> page 270). Our method however generates a convergent sequence, as 8 shown in Table 1, where sensitivity analysis has been conducted to determine a suitable value for the parameter ff. These limited results show the robustness of the algorithm with respect to the value of ff.

Reference-contexts: Consider the variational inequality problem (VIP): Find v fl in V such that hF (v fl ); v fl vi 0 8v 2 V: (1) The compactness of the set V and the continuity of the mapping F ensure that the solution set of the VIP is nonempty (see <ref> [5] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Thus, v fl is a solution to the VIP if only if it is a global solution for the mathematical programming problem min g 1 (v): (3) Unfortunately, the gap function formulation usually leads to a nondifferentiable, nonconvex optimization problem (see Marcotte <ref> [7] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Proof. From our assumptions, we have that 0 is continuous with respect to u. According to the symmetry principle, We have that r u (u; v) = 0 (u; v) 0 (v; v) (see pages 95-96 of <ref> [8] </ref>) and r 2 u (u; v) = r u 0 (u; v) is a diagonal matrix with positive diagonal elements. Thus (u; v) is strongly convex in u and 0 (u; v) is monotone in u.

Conditions 1 and 2 of Theorem A hold trivially in our case. Let us consider condition 3, namely the closedness of the algorithmic map. Assuming an exact line search, it suffices to check the closedness of the descent direction mapping D (v).

In this paper we weaken these conditions and show that, resulting from a suitable choice of the parameter ff, the generic algorithm yields a globally convergent method for solving monotone variational inequalities.
