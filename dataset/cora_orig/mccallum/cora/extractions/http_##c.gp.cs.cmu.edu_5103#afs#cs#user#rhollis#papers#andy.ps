Abstract: Substrates for most of today's electronic products contain many wiring layers which are individually fabricated, mechanically registered with one another, and laminated together. Alignment tolerances of 0.05 mm to 0.1 mm are sufficient to register the vertical connection pads or vias on each layer. More aggressive designs of the future will, however, require manufacturing accuracies of at least an order of magnitude better to accommodate much finer wire widths and pin spacings. Conventional equipment relying on mechanical "pin-in-slot" methods will likely be inadequate, and a new approach will be needed. We describe here a sensor-based approach for registration and stacking of electronic substrate sublaminates that replaces pin-in-slot methods, yet does not require accurate automation equipment. A pilot work cell for this approach is presented, which has an IBM 7576 coarse-positioning robot, a specially-developed fine-positioning robot, optical sensors, and several routine low accuracy fixtures. A novel robot bracing method was used to minimize environmental vibration during sublaminate stacking.

Reference-contexts: Coarse and fine manipulators The system used a standard IBM 7576 robot coarse positioning manipulator (CM) with a specially developed IBM fine positioning manipulator (FM) <ref> [1] </ref>, fastened to its tooling end (Fig. 3). Optical sensors, feeder stations and an IBM PC-AT industrial computer complete the system.

Reference-contexts: The FM was the critical component of the aligner system as it provided precision fine motions for the alignment process as well as acting as a calibrator for the optical sensors. The CM+FM combination with endpoint optical sensing <ref> [2] </ref> makes possible very small moves anywhere within the CM's workspace. A similar strategy has been used successfully for mounting fine-pitch components on circuit boards [3].

Reference-contexts: The CM+FM combination with endpoint optical sensing [2] makes possible very small moves anywhere within the CM's workspace. A similar strategy has been used successfully for mounting fine-pitch components on circuit boards <ref> [3] </ref>. A program-actuated vacuum chuck attached to the FM carries sublaminates from the feeder station to the alignment and stacking area. 4 Optical sensors The optical sensors located a set of fiducials in each sublaminate and registered their coordinates to the alignment system.

Reference-contexts: Mechanical grounds are provided for both the FM and the CM. Vibrations occur at the unrestrained end of the CM with amplitudes of about 10 m in the frequency range of 1-50 Hz, typical of environmental noise. Various means of bracing to reduce vibration are described by Book <ref> [4] </ref>. A unique bracing method used in this system [5] is shown in Fig. 2. It uses two mechanical grounds or "V" blocks.
