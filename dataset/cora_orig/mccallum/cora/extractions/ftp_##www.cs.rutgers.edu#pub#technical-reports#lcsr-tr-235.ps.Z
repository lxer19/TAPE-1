Title: Constructing Piecewise Linear Homeomorphisms  
Author: Diane Souvaine and Rephael Wenger 
Date: November 4, 1994  
Abstract: Let P = fp 1 ; : : :; p n g and Q = fq 1 ; : : :; q n g be two point sets lying in the interior of rectangles in the plane. We show how to construct a piecewise linear homeomorphism of size O(n 2 ) between the rectangles which maps p i to q i for each i. This bound is optimal in the worst case; i.e., there exist point sets for which any piecewise linear homeomorphism has size (n 2 ).

Reference-contexts: Such isomorphic triangulations of R p and R q are called joint triangulations in [3] and compatible triangulations in <ref> [1] </ref>. Triangulations t p and t q define a piecewise linear homeomorphism h between R p and R q as follows. For every vertex v 2 t p corresponding to vertex v 0 2 t q , let h (v) = v 0 . <p> Of course, no such triangulation is possible if the vertices in clockwise order around the convex hull of P do not correspond to the vertices in clockwise order around the convex hull of Q. Saalfeld's construction uses an exponential number of additional vertices, edges and triangles. In <ref> [1] </ref>, Aronov, Seidel and Souvaine show how to construct isomorphic triangulations of two simple polygons with vertices P = fp 1 ; : : : ; p n g and Q = fq 1 ; : : : ; q n g in clockwise order such that p i and q <p> These results also give fi (n 2 ) bounds for the problem considered by Saalfeld.

Outline of proof: The paper <ref> [1] </ref> contains a proof when P and Q are exactly the vertex sets of R p and R q , respectively, but the proof for this generalized version is the same.

Reference-contexts: This paper shows that in the worst case at most O (n 2 ) vertices are required and gives an O (n 2 ) algorithm for constructing a homeomorphism of that size. By a result of Pach, Shahrokhi and Szegedy, these bounds are asymptotically tight <ref> [2] </ref>. Formal Definitions and Statement of Goals A homeomorphism h from region R p to region R q is piecewise linear if there is some triangulation of R p such that h is linear on each triangle in the triangulation. <p> Such triangulations induce homeomorphisms of size O (n 2 ). A recent result of Pach, Shahrokhi and Szegedy implies that such a construction is optimal in the worst case; i.e., there exist point sets for which any isomorphic triangulations and piecewise linear homeomorphism have size (n 2 ) <ref> [2] </ref>. These results also give fi (n 2 ) bounds for the problem considered by Saalfeld. Constructing Isomorphic Triangulations We start with a slight generalization of a theorem from [1]. <p> Lower Bounds The bounds in Theorem 2 are optimal in the worst case by an argument of Pach, Shahrokhi and Szegedy <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Their primary drawback is their lack of smoothness between pieces and the possibility of unnecessarily introducing large angular distortion. Nevertheless, their innate simplicity recommends them for constructing homeomorphisms between complex regions or for constructing homeomorphisms under many constraints. In <ref> [3] </ref>, Saalfeld proposed using piecewise linear homeomorphisms for map conflation, the process of merging cartographic maps. <p> Such isomorphic triangulations of R p and R q are called joint triangulations in <ref> [3] </ref> and compatible triangulations in [1]. Triangulations t p and t q define a piecewise linear homeomorphism h between R p and R q as follows. For every vertex v 2 t p corresponding to vertex v 0 2 t q , let h (v) = v 0 . <p> The map h is a piecewise linear homeomorphism from R p to R q . In <ref> [3] </ref>, Saalfeld gives a method for constructing isomorphic triangulations between the convex hull of a point set P = fp 1 ; : : : ; p n g and Q = fq 1 ; : : : ; q n g 3 such that p i and q i are
