Abstract: In this paper we discuss the real-time multi-agent coordination and control requirements of automobile and submarine systems. We illustrate the use of hybrid systems techniques for analyzing and synthesizing the control architectures and show how they can be implemented using the diadem system.

Reference-contexts: B. Models of the Architectures The PATH and the GV architectures are modeled as dynamic networks of hybrid systems, the underlying formalism of the Shift <ref> [1] </ref> specification language and of the real-time control synthesis tool diadem. The dynamic configuration of the network adds the expressive power required to model the synchronous and asynchronous dynamic relations (that are created and modified in real-time) among hybrid automatons that provide the required modularity and flexibility.

Reference-contexts: The sequence t may be finite or infinite, and it may cover R + or only an initial segment of it. The formal semantics of the hybrid transition system are described in <ref> [3] </ref>. The set of !-runs of H (i.e., runs that have infinitely many transitions) is designated S H . Different !-acceptance conditions|Buchi, Muller, Rabin|can be imposed on a hybrid transition system to obtain a hybrid automaton. <p> Abstractions of dynamic systems are usually required for the application of algorithmic tools [4], [13],[14]. Unfortunately, a large class of systems is undecidable. Nerode and Kohn [12] and Branicky, Borkar, and Mitter [11] give an approach to optimal control of hybrid systems. Deshpande and Varaiya <ref> [3] </ref> give an approach to viable control of hybrid systems.

Reference-contexts: Hybrid systems in which a problem can be solved algorithmically in a finite number of steps are called decidable. Abstractions of dynamic systems are usually required for the application of algorithmic tools <ref> [4] </ref>, [13],[14]. Unfortunately, a large class of systems is undecidable. Nerode and Kohn [12] and Branicky, Borkar, and Mitter [11] give an approach to optimal control of hybrid systems. Deshpande and Varaiya [3] give an approach to viable control of hybrid systems. <p> Projects are underway to integrate diadem with the Shift system for simulation and the kronos tool <ref> [4] </ref> for verification. The diadem-based application can have multiple server processes and multiple client processes. The server and client processes can start up and shutdown dynamically. They can make and break connections and send messages between each other dynamically according to the needs of the application.
