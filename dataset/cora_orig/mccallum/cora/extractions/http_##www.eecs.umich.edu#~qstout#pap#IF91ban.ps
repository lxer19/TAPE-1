Abstract: The problem of allocating patients in a two treatment clinical trial with dichotomous response is considered. The trial goal is to determine the better treatment while incurring as few patient losses as possible. Several allocation rules are compared and it is found that bandit strategies perform well on both criteria in that they achieve nearly optimal power while keeping expected trial failures nearly minimal. The rules are also evaluated according to their computational complexity.

Reference-contexts: The space requirements can be kept at fi (n 3 ) (see [3]). 3.2 Gittins Lower Bound According to a theorem of Gittins and Jones <ref> [1] </ref>, for bandit problems with geometric discount and independent arms, for each arm there exists an index with the property that, at any given stage, it is optimal to select, at the next stage, the arm with the higher index. <p> While the existence of the Gittins Index removes many computational difficulties associated with other bandit problems, the only known technique for computing the index involves an iterated dynamic programming approach which is computationally intensive when fi is close to 1 (see <ref> [1] </ref>). Unfortunately, these are the fi values needed to produce tests of suitable power. Here we show that very good results can be achieved by utilizing an easily computed approximation. <p> Unfortunately, these are the fi values needed to produce tests of suitable power.

Reference-contexts: Thus bandit allocation strategies for problems with geometric discounting are not exactly optimal for the truncated case. As we see, however, these rules still provide good model strategies for the problem at hand. See Hardwick <ref> [2] </ref> for further discussion of the incorporation of geometric bandit strategies in clinical trial designs. 2.3 Computational Criteria Ethical attributes aside, an experimental design must be straightforward to carry out if it is to be useful. <p> Unfortunately, these are the fi values needed to produce tests of suitable power. Here we show that very good results can be achieved by utilizing an easily computed approximation. For an arm with posterior distribution Be (a; b), a lower bound for the Gittins Index is given by (see <ref> [1, 2] </ref>) fl r = (a+b+1) b i=1 fi i (a+i) (a) P r (a+b+i) Parameters ! = 0:1 = 0:3 # Criteria TAA TGLB UB TAA TGLB UB n=20 Power 0.671 0.667 0.647 0.913 0.906 0.874 fi = :999 Average Failures 9.947 9.774 9.768 9.505 8.330 8.217 n=50 Power 0.760

Reference-contexts: The testing regions here, however, have been established so that we may study the behavior of the allocation rules over the entire parameter space and obtain lower bounds for the power of (3). In <ref> [3] </ref>, we examine problems incorporating both type I and II errors. It is not difficult to show that, for any P 2 , the probability of making an incorrect decision based on (3) is minimized by allocating patients to therapies in equal proportions. <p> The latter may require timely response, and may often be performed on personal computers. The latter will be analyzed here in the next section, while the former will be discussed in <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 Allocation Rules The following three allocation rules were evaluated with respect to the given criteria: TAA = Truncated Alternating Allocation, UB = Uniform Bandit, and TGLB = Truncated Gittins Lower Bound. <p> A clever implementation might not evaluate all possible values, but a straightforward implementation, as used here, needs to do so, and empirical evidence indicates that, in fact, fi (n 4 ) values must be computed. The space requirements can be kept at fi (n 3 ) (see <ref> [3] </ref>). 3.2 Gittins Lower Bound According to a theorem of Gittins and Jones [1], for bandit problems with geometric discount and independent arms, for each arm there exists an index with the property that, at any given stage, it is optimal to select, at the next stage, the arm with the <p> The computational techniques used are explained in <ref> [3] </ref>. Table 1 shows that TAA, which is optimized to make the correct selection, incurs a large ethical cost, while UB, which is optimized to minimize failures, has a poor discrimination ability.
