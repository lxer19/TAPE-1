Abstract: We consider the problem of sending raw image data over lossy or heterogeneous network connections with as little overhead as possible. In lossy network connections, packets lost due to transmission errors or buffer overflows are not retransmitted. On the other hand, in heterogeneous network connections packets must be dropped due to encountering a link with lower capacity. If the network connection supports multiple priority levels, an obvious approach is layered, multiresolution coding and transmission. However, if the network drops packets at random, a different approach is needed; This calls for a technique where the data is divided into parts of equal importance so that the image could be at least partially reconstructed from the packets available. We have found theoretical criteria for an image to be broken into pieces of equal importance, developed an algorithm for such criteria to be implemented and devised a signal processing scheme based on critically-sampled fast implementation filter banks. Experiments show that although the overhead is not large, it can further be reduced by using a scrambler. This scheme also solves the problem of holographic image representation.

Reference-contexts: Thus, 1 in a scenario where a packet needs to be dropped, network control mechanisms will discard first those bearing a low-priority stamp. On the recipient side, the image is reconstructed from the essential information that got through. The same scenario applies to video transmission <ref> [1] </ref>. This scheme introduces no additional data but requires the additional complexity of examining the contents of each packet.

One important difference with regard to our work (besides our working with raw image data) is that in [7] one must wait for all the data to arrive before attempting reconstruction; here we can successively refine our image as the packets arrive, and can stop at any point at which we deem the image quality to be acceptable.

Reference-contexts: Note that this problem is similar to that of holographic image representation where one asks for a possibility 2 of reconstructing the image from as small a piece of the image as possible. Two possible solutions are given by Bruckstein, Holt and Netravali in <ref> [8] </ref>. 2 Equal Energy Distribution Criterion Let f be an image sequence which can be symbolically decomposed into n components f i , f = i=1 where each f i is put into a packet and transmitted.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the first criterion for choosing the f i is: kf f i k 2 = kf f j k 2 ; (2) for all i; j. At the same time, recall that we are going to decompose f using orthonormal filter banks. These filter banks implement orthonormal expansions <ref> [9] </ref> of a square-summable sequence f where the output of the analysis filter bank gives the coefficients of the signal expansion while the output of the synthesis filter bank gives f i [9]. <p> These filter banks implement orthonormal expansions <ref> [9] </ref> of a square-summable sequence f where the output of the analysis filter bank gives the coefficients of the signal expansion while the output of the synthesis filter bank gives f i [9]. <p> Note that such a result is not known in the general, n-packet case. 4 Experimental Results Our proposed scheme works as follows: we use a k-channel orthonormal filter bank <ref> [9] </ref> (see Figure 1 (a)). In particular, we use cosine-modulated filter banks because they have proven to be very efficient to implement since all filters are obtained by modulation of a single prototype filter.

Reference-contexts: Our grouping problem is known in computer science as the parallel machine scheduling problem which requires the assignment of k tasks to n identical processors so as to minimize the largest task finishing time (makespan) <ref> [10] </ref>. The constraint that each bin contain the same number of numbers is scheduling with cardinality balance, that is, the number of tasks assigned to each processor is either bk=nc or dk=ne. Several probabilistic analyses of heuristic algorithms have been done for scheduling problems with cardinality balance.

Reference-contexts: Since the DC band usually carries much more energy than the other, higher-frequency subbands (even an order of magnitude), we have to readjust our scheme (as was done in <ref> [15] </ref>) and first subtract the lowest subband before going through the analysis bank. This lowest subband is then added to each of the packets.
