Abstract: the antisymmetry condition !(3T t) = !(t). Furthermore, by openness of the domain of definition of solutions, there is a scalar smooth real function : IR + ! IR + such that the control -(x) = (kxk 2 )!() is so that the solution (t; -(x); x) is defined on all of [0; T ]. The control -(x) is as needed in the constructions in [1] for obtaining time-varying feedback controllers for systems with no drift. The following control strategy is natural given the result in this note, for systems with no drift. Assume that the goal is to transfer a state x into a final state, say 0. Generate a random control ! on some small interval [0; T ], and let ~ be the solution obtained by using the control - on [0; 2T ] that equals ! followed by its antisymmetric extension !(2T t) = !(t), t 2 [T; 2T ]. Thus, unless the solution ceases to be defined, it follows that ~(2T ) = x. Furthermore, with "probability one" the linearization along this trajectory is nonsingular. Thus a linear least-squares (pseudo-inverse) procedure can be used to obtain a perturbation -0 on [0; 2T ] so that the state that results is closer to zero than x was. This procedure can now be iterated in the same fashion.
