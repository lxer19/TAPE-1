Title: The Analysis of a List-Coloring Algorithm on a Random Graph (extended abstract)  
Author: Dimitris Achlioptas Michael Molloy 
Date: 97  
Note: Appeared in FOCS  
Abstract: We introduce a natural k-coloring algorithm and analyze its performance on random graphs with constant expected degree c (G n;p=c=n ). For k = 3 our re sults imply that almost all graphs with n vertices and 1:923 n edges are 3-colorable. This improves the lower bound on the threshold for random 3-colorability significantly and settles the last case of a long-standing open question of Bollobas [5]. We also provide a tight asymptotic analysis of the algorithm. We show that for all k 3, if c k ln k 3=2k then the algorithm almost surely succeeds, while for any * &gt; 0, and k sufficiently large, if c (1 + *)k ln k then the algorithm almost surely fails. The analysis is based on the use of differential equations to approximate the mean path of certain Markov chains.

Reference-contexts: Using the main theorem of [14], Achlioptas and Friedgut <ref> [1] </ref> showed that the chromatic number of a random graph exhibits a sharp threshold, in the sense that for k 3, there exists c k (n) &gt; 0, such that for any c &lt; c k (n), a.s.

Theorem 1 d 3 = W 1 ( exp (5=2)) = 3:847 : : : Let n!1 From <ref> [1] </ref>, it follows that for all c; * &gt; 0, if f k (c) * then f k (c 0 ) = 1; for c 0 &lt; c : This fact along with theorem 1 imply that c 3 d 3 . <p> It is easy to verify that in [0; x 0 ], u 2 is unimodal (in fact u 2 is uni modal in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>) and in particular u 2 (x) u 2 (ln c=c) = (c ln c 1)=c. <p> In spite of this fact, we will be able to prove that they provide a lower bound to the solutions of S for all x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Using the lower bound for jU 2 (t)j, we will derive a condition on c such that k-GL a.s. fails. <p> Using the lower bound for jU 2 (t)j, we will derive a condition on c such that k-GL a.s. fails. Recall that u i (x) = 0, for x 2 [0; x s i ] and, by lemma 5, u i (x) 0, for x 2 <ref> [x s i ; 1] </ref>. For all 2 i k, we will define a function l i , similar to u i , and prove that l i (x) u i (x), for all x 2 [0; 1]. <p> For all 2 i k, we will define a function l i , similar to u i , and prove that l i (x) u i (x), for all x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Specifically, l k (x) = 1 x, while for 2 i k, l i (0) = 0 and i (x) = c k Lemma 7 For 2 i k, l i (x) u i (x) ; Proof The proof will be by "backwards induction". <p> Base case: Trivial, since l k (x) = u k (x) = 1 x. Inductive step: Assume that the lemma is true for l i+1 ; u i+1 , 3 i + 1 k and let fl = c i+1 k . Then for all x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> Z x exp (fls) (fll i+1 (s) 1) ds Z x exp (fls) (flu i+1 (s) 1) ds Z x s 0 + x s exp (fls) (flu i+1 (s) 1) ds) The last inequality is derived by taking cases: if x 2 [0; x s i ] we <p> Hence, we keep both summands and get l i (x) 0 = u i (x). If x 2 <ref> [x s i ; 1] </ref> we use that for all s 2 [0; x s i ], flu i+1 (s) 1. <p> Since 1= &lt; x b &lt; x b + , using lemma 8, we can guarantee that for all x 2 [x b ; x b + ], for k k 1 () l 2 (x) &gt; 2 k!1 1 : (8) Since for all x 2 <ref> [x e 2 ; 1] </ref>, u 2 (x) 0, and for all x 2 [0; 1], by lemma 7, u 2 (x) l 2 (x), we get x b &lt; x b + &lt; x e 2 . <p> lemma 8, we can guarantee that for all x 2 [x b ; x b + ], for k k 1 () l 2 (x) &gt; 2 k!1 1 : (8) Since for all x 2 [x e 2 ; 1], u 2 (x) 0, and for all x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, by lemma 7, u 2 (x) l 2 (x), we get x b &lt; x b + &lt; x e 2 . Thus, for x b n t (x b + )n, we have jU 2 (t)j = u 2 (t=n)n+o (n) l 2 (t=n)n+o (n), as desired.

Reference-contexts: One of the first heuristics to be analyzed [18],[4], GIC, forms color classes by repeatedly removing greedily chosen independent sets until the remaining graph has no component with more than one cycle, at which point it is easy to 3-color it . Shamir and Upfal <ref> [32] </ref> and Fer-nandez de la Vega [13] showed that for any * &gt; 0, there exists k k (*) such that if c &lt; (1 + *)k ln k then GIC a.s. succeeds in k-coloring G n;p=c=n , while if c &gt; (1+*)k ln k then GIC a.s. fails to k-color

Reference-contexts: Quantifying "sharp" and deriving general conditions for the "sudden appearance" of properties has been studied in <ref> [6, 7, 14, 15, 20, 31, 33] </ref>, among numerous others. Recently, Friedgut [14] made very significant progress in our understanding of this area by establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for a property to have a sharp threshold.

Reference-contexts: This allows us to model the behavior of these sizes throughout the algorithm's execution with a set of functions s 1 (x); :::; s k (x) defined by a system of differential equations. It follows from the main theorem of <ref> [34] </ref> that for 0 &lt; x &lt; 1, after roughly xn vertices have been colored, a.s. jS i j = s i (x)n + o (n). <p> It follows from the main theorem of [34] that for 0 &lt; x &lt; 1, after roughly xn vertices have been colored, a.s. jS i j = s i (x)n + o (n). This is a common technique for other applications see <ref> [8, 9, 17, 21, 28, 30, 34] </ref> - and we omit a detailed justification in this extended abstract. We show that if s 0 1 (x) &lt; 0 for all 0 x 1, then the algorithm will succeed with constant positive probability. <p> Let x 0 denote the smallest root of u 2 (x) in (0; 1]. The following follows immediately from the main theorem of <ref> [34] </ref>. <p> The three differential equations are "symmetric" and moreover, the initial conditions are identical for all `, s ` 2 (0) = 0. Hence, s ` 1 2 s ` 2 ` 1 ; ` 2 and the claim follows the main theorem of <ref> [34] </ref>. For general k the ingredients of the proof are similar. The claim is trivially true for the only list of length k and in general the equidistribution of the k lists in S i implies the validity of the expression for E [U i1 (t)].
