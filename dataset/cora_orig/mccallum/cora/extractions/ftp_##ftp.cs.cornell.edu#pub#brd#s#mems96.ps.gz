Abstract: Arrays of electrostatic MEMS actuators have been fabricated using a modified, multi-layer SCREAM (Single-Crystal Reactive Etching and Metallization) process. The devices consist of released, torsionally suspended grids with high aspect ratio single-crystal silicon (SCS) tips. They can be used to generate a force field for the manipulation of small, flat objects. Calculations and experiments show that the actuator array is strong enough to move macroscopic parts. An individual actuator can generate a force of approximately 10 N and a displacement of 5 m. Monolithic arrays have been built reaching a size of up to 10 cm 2 , with up to 15,000 individual single-crystal silicon actuators on one chip. We investigate micro actuators for manipulation tasks, and discuss important issues and trade-offs in design, processing and fabrication. We describe manipulation experiments in which small, flat objects where lifted and moved. We conclude with an outlook on applications of programmable actuator arrays to more elaborate micro manipulation tasks and give an outline on how they can be used for transporting, positioning, sorting, and assembly of small parts.

In earlier work we have presented several strategies for sorting, positioning, and orienting parts <ref> [5, 4] </ref>. The automatically generated manipulation plans are based on the principle of parts manipulation in force vector fields generated by MEMS arrays.

Reference-contexts: Depending on surface properties like roughness or elasticity, the speed of the object can be influenced by slip, deformation, and damping. More experiments will be necessary to determine the effects of these phenomena. But see e.g. <ref> [12, 11] </ref> for an investigation of friction in micro structures.
