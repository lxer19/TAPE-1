Title: Radial Basis Functions: L p -approximation orders with scattered centres  
Author: Martin D. Buhmann and Amos Ron 
Abstract: In this paper we generalize several results on uniform approximation orders with radial basis functions in (Buhmann, Dyn and Levin, 1993) and (Dyn and Ron, 1993) to L p -approximation orders. These results apply, in particular, to approximants from spaces spanned by translates of radial basis functions by scattered centres. Examples to which our results apply include quasi-interpolation and least-squares approximation from radial function spaces.

Reference-contexts: There are several recent reviews about the state-of-the-art in the investigation of radial basis function methods, but we mention here only the one due to the first author <ref> (1993) </ref>. It is apparent from this survey that, in most articles about radial basis functions and their approximation properties so far, only translates along multiintegers have been studied in detail. <p> Copyright o c 1991 by AKPeters, Boston.

Buhmann and Amos Ron work to infinitely many scattered centres have not been provided until recently, when the works of Buhmann, Dyn and Levin, and by Dyn and Ron <ref> (both 1993) </ref> were completed. In both papers, quasi-interpolation from radial basis function spaces with infinitely many scattered centres is analyzed. In the former paper, quasi-interpolants for sets of scattered centres that enjoy certain regularity conditions are explicitly constructed. <p> The class of radial basis functions for which this approach applies is restricted by various conditions, but none of the usually considered 's is excluded. In <ref> (Dyn and Ron, 1993) </ref>, a different track is proposed. Rather than constructing directly approximation schemes that employ scattered translates of ', this paper suggests and analyzes a method for converting known "gridded centre approximation schemes" to the scattered case. <p> The difference '( j) ' j then has to satisfy a certain decay condition and there are other conditions on the gridded centre scheme. This work applies to the class of radial basis functions as defined in <ref> (Buhmann, Dyn and Levin, 1993) </ref>. It is, in fact, more general because not just one quasi-interpolant for scattered centres is manufactured. Instead, a general conversion method is established that allows many approximation schemes to be converted from gridded to scattered centres. <p> mention here the work of Lei and Jia (1991), where L p (IR n )-approximation orders are established from spaces spanned by gridded translates of a compactly supported piecewise-exponential function; in this regard we also mention arguments employed in the book on box splines by de Boor, Hollig and Riemenschneider <ref> (1993) </ref> for a related theorem on L p -approximation orders. Later, Jia and Lei (1993) offered approximation schemes and a complementary error analysis for spaces generated by the grid-ded translates of several non-compactly supported functions. <p> )-approximation orders are established from spaces spanned by gridded translates of a compactly supported piecewise-exponential function; in this regard we also mention arguments employed in the book on box splines by de Boor, Hollig and Riemenschneider <ref> (1993) </ref> for a related theorem on L p -approximation orders. Later, Jia and Lei (1993) offered approximation schemes and a complementary error analysis for spaces generated by the grid-ded translates of several non-compactly supported functions. <p> This applies to quasi-interpolation with basis functions of global support, such as is required here for radial basis function approximants, in contrast to the L p - approximation order result by <ref> (de Boor, Hollig and Riemenschneider, 1993) </ref> which only applies to compactly supported basis functions '. On the other hand, the scheme proposed by Jia and Lei is more specific in nature. <p> derivations either involve some complementary information of the exact decay rates of (as in Buhmann, 1989, or in Dyn, Jackson, Levin and Ron, 1992), or require a substantial modification of the approximation schemes as well as their error analyses (as is the case in (de Boor and Ron, 1992a) and <ref> (de Boor, DeVore and Ron, 1993) </ref>). However, the second condition, i.e., that fl 0 be the identity on k1 can be relaxed to (the more standard one) that fl 0 induces a linear isomorphism on k1 . <p> L p -approximation orders using scattered centres We use the results of the previous section in the derivation of approximation schemes that employ scattered translates of the basis function '. The approach as well as the error analysis follow the work of <ref> (Dyn and Ron, 1993) </ref>, where L 1 -approximation orders were obtained. <p> We shall as before consider the approximation operator f 7! Lg := fl 0 g, where g = fl f with 2 C k (IR n ) satisfying (2.2) and (2.1). We make assumptions according to those in <ref> (Dyn and Ron, 1993) </ref>: we always assume from now on that the thus constructed L : C (IR n ) " L 1 (IR n ) ! C (IR n ) " L 1 (IR n ) is a bounded operator without further mention. <p> We remark that other, more flexible refinements may be allowed, too, and refer the interested reader to the discussion of that point in x2.6 of <ref> (Dyn and Ron, 1993) </ref> and to the specific strategy suggested for the purpose of treating sets of scattered centres becoming dense in the underlying space in the paper (Buhmann, Dyn and Levin, 1993). Theorem 3. Let ', , , j , L h and L h;A be as above. <p> other, more flexible refinements may be allowed, too, and refer the interested reader to the discussion of that point in x2.6 of (Dyn and Ron, 1993) and to the specific strategy suggested for the purpose of treating sets of scattered centres becoming dense in the underlying space in the paper <ref> (Buhmann, Dyn and Levin, 1993) </ref>. Theorem 3. Let ', , , j , L h and L h;A be as above. Assume that (3.2) and (3.3) hold. <p> This well-definedness has been established in Dyn and Ron <ref> (1993) </ref>; cf. Lemma 2.2.6 in that article. Proof. We begin with establishing (3.8). We may consider L and L A instead of L h and L h;A , because, as we have pointed out earlier, the powers of h are introduced by a suitable scaling. <p> All these estimates were proved for instance in <ref> (Buhmann, Dyn and Levin, 1993) </ref>, and are also well-documented in Dyn and Ron (1993). <p> All these estimates were proved for instance in (Buhmann, Dyn and Levin, 1993), and are also well-documented in Dyn and Ron <ref> (1993) </ref>. <p> When finally estimating (L h L h;A )( fl f ), we simply invoke (3.13) with f replaced by 1=h f for the given value of h, and then scale to obtain (3.7). In analogy to Theorem 2.3.1 in <ref> (Dyn and Ron, 1993) </ref> (where the case p = 1 was discussed) we establish the following result. <p> Proof. Recall that 2 ` 1 (ZZ n ), which renders f well-defined. The crux in the proof is the identity f = b b f : (3:20) This can be derived as in <ref> (Dyn and Ron, 1993) </ref> (cf. the proof of the lemma in Theorem 2.3.1 in that article), where the Poisson Summation Formula (Stein and Weiss, 1971, p. 252) is the salient ingredient to the proof and which else requires only b f 2 L 1 (IR n ) and boundedness of f <p> We take ' to belong to a class specified in (Buhmann and Micchelli, 1992) which contains all the functions that are mentioned in the current literature, see, e.g., the survey by Buhmann <ref> (1993) </ref>. <p> It therefore decays fast enough to admit actually any f 2 L p (IR n ), p 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, in (3.23), namely, for every f 2 L p (IR n ), the series in (3.23) converges unconditionally and uniformly on compacta to an L p (IR n ) function.
