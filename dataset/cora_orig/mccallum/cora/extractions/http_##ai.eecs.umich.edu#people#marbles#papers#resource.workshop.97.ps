Abstract: 1 To appear in the AAAI-97 Workshop: Building Resource-Bounded Reasoning Systems Technical Report. ABSTRACT To react appropriately in hard real-time environments, a system must either employ fast dynamic planning or recall a pre-built reactive response. For complex problems, real-time, accurate dynamic planning may be impossible, and the complete set of possible reactions may be too large to build and store in advance. In this paper, we propose combining offline and online planning such that a set of offline plans are built and stored to maximize the amount of time available for any subsequent online planning. We explore this concept in CIRCA, the Cooperative Intelligent Real-time Control Architecture, which has concentrated on guaranteeing failure avoidance via a combination of planning, scheduling, and real-time plan execution. We are in the process of implementing a plan cache which will increase CIRCAs overall likelihood of success in time-constrained situations, and we illustrate potential gains from these modifications using a simple example from the fully-automated aircraft domain.

Reference-contexts: We consider the set of states for which appropriate reactions have been prepared the planned-for set, and any other states unplanned-for. As discussed in <ref> (Atkins, Durfee, and Shin 1997) </ref>, a planner can use its model of the world to detect transitions to unplanned-for states, a particularly crucial endeavor when such states may lead to system failure. 2 The notion of minimum delay before a temporal transition to failure (ttf) is discussed further in (Musliner, Durfee, <p> This plan, composed of a set of testaction pairs (TAPs), is scheduled such that all time-critical actions will be guaranteed to execute before their deadlines, which correspond to the minimum time before a transition to 3 Previous versions of CIRCA, (Musliner, Durfee, and Shin 1995) and <ref> (Atkins, Durfee, and Shin 1997) </ref>, built and scheduled one plan at a time, then began executing that plan before constructing any other plans. <p> First, for each subgoal to be achieved, CIRCA builds a nominal plan (depicted by Planned-for States 1 in will be sufficient if all goes normally, i.e., only the highest-probability expected events occur. These nominal plans also contain tests to detect when unplanned-for events occur, as described in <ref> (Atkins, Durfee, and Shin 1997) </ref>. For the set of unplanned-for states that may quickly transition to failure (those with an outgoing fast ttf in Figure 1) a contingency plan is required. <p> To illustrate how our additions to CIRCA will buy time for planning, consider a situation in which the aircraft is on final approach to a normal landing, but senses inoperative landing gear. Because this is an improbable thus unplanned-for state <ref> (Atkins, Durfee, and Shin 1997) </ref>, the system leaves the nominal state set for which the executing CIRCA plan will act in guaranteed real-time. Also, since the system fails (crashes) if the aircraft continues its normal descent to landing without gear, there is a fast TTF present.

Reference-contexts: We are concerned with the implications of requiring hard real-time response guarantees, particularly with respect to limiting deliberation time. Many approaches have been used to bound planning time, including anytime (Dean et al., 1993), design-to-time (Garvey and Lesser 1993), and abstraction planning <ref> (Boutilier and Dearden 1994) </ref> algorithms. For example, an anytime planner will build its solution iteratively such that it may provide the best solution it has computed when interrupted.

Reference-contexts: The final product of a planning system, the plan, contains reactions to handle only a subset of all possible world states, since it is infeasible to assume the existence of a universal plan set in complex problem domains <ref> (Ginsberg 1989) </ref>. We consider the set of states for which appropriate reactions have been prepared the planned-for set, and any other states unplanned-for.

Reference-contexts: Next, we discuss the ongoing implementation of these algorithms in the Cooperative Intelligent Real-time Control Architecture (CIRCA) <ref> (Musliner, Durfee, and Shin 1995) </ref>, a system which combines methods from both the real-time and planning fields to allow real-time response guarantees in time-critical situations. <p> in (Atkins, Durfee, and Shin 1997), a planner can use its model of the world to detect transitions to unplanned-for states, a particularly crucial endeavor when such states may lead to system failure. 2 The notion of minimum delay before a temporal transition to failure (ttf) is discussed further in <ref> (Musliner, Durfee, and Shin 1995) </ref>. Our focus in this paper is to illustrate how careful offline reasoning can augment the quality of online, time-constrained responses whenever a system departs from the set of planned-for states. <p> This plan, composed of a set of testaction pairs (TAPs), is scheduled such that all time-critical actions will be guaranteed to execute before their deadlines, which correspond to the minimum time before a transition to 3 Previous versions of CIRCA, <ref> (Musliner, Durfee, and Shin 1995) </ref> and (Atkins, Durfee, and Shin 1997), built and scheduled one plan at a time, then began executing that plan before constructing any other plans.
