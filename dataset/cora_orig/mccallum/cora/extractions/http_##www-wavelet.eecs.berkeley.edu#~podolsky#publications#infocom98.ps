Abstract: Real-time audio over a best-effort network, such as the Internet, frequently suffers from packet loss. To mitigate the impact of such packet loss, several research efforts [1, 2] and implementation studies [3] advocate the use of forward error correction (FEC) coding. Although these prior works have pioneered promising and novel applications of FEC to Internet audio, they do not definitively demonstrate the advantages of FEC because they do not evaluate aggregate performance that results from multiplexing many like flows. For example, [1] assesses the efficacy of FEC by generalizing the performance of a single audio connection; [3] restricts its design space to one particular coding scheme and does not evaluate the potentially negative impact of increased network load that results from FEC; and [2] limits its scope to an all-audio source network employing a simplistic FEC-encoding. In this paper, we build on these landmark works with a systematic study of FEC for packet audio that characterizes the aggregate performance across all audio sources in the network. We refine the novel but ad hoc coding techniques proposed in [3] into a formal framework that we call signal processing-based FEC (SFEC) and use our framework to more rigorously evaluate the relative merits of this approach. Through extensive simulation, we evaluate the scalability of SFEC for packet audio i.e., the ability for a coding algorithm to improve aggregate performance when used by all sources in the network and find that optimal signal quality is achieved when sources react to network congestion not by blindly adding FEC, but rather by adding FEC in a controlled fashion that simultaneously constrains the source-coding rate. As a result, packet loss is mitigated without introducing more congestion, thus admitting a more scalable and effective approach than successively adding redundancy to a constant bit-rate source. While this result may seem intuitive, it has not been previously suggested in the context of Internet audio, and until now, has not been systematically studied.

Reference-contexts: Naturally, these error-correcting capabilities incur a cost since the FEC codes represent redundant information that increases the overall transmission rate. Despite this cost, a new variant of FEC for Internet audio has recently been devised that, at least qualitatively, leads to greatly improved packet audio performance <ref> [3, 13, 1] </ref>. Initial experience with this approach in the Robust Audio Codec from University College London [3] and the FreeP-hone tool from INRIA [13] has provided strong anecdotal evidence that the model is sound. <p> Furthermore, since the LPC encoding of audio frame 4 is also contained in this packet, and the higher-quality AD-PCM encoding was lost, frame 4 is decoded with distortion D 1 . As described in <ref> [3, 13, 1] </ref>, SFEC can be extended beyond a single redundant stream. In this extension, multiple sub-streams are coded at multiple rates (with successively lower quality) and are interlaced at increasing phase offsets. <p> Although this extension can improve performance, for simplicity we limit our analysis throughout this paper to the case where = 1. 3 Simulation Having re-cast the FEC scheme proposed in <ref> [3, 13, 1] </ref> into our SFEC framework, we are now prepared to elaborate this earlier work with a systematic evaluation of the overall efficacy of the approach. <p> A fixed packet length of 512 Bytes was chosen for the packet size. The average packet inter-arrival rate was determined by the desired average bandwidth of non-audio traffic. 3.2 Evaluation Metrics In <ref> [1] </ref>, a relative reward measure is used as an indication of the audio quality at the receiver. <p> Since FEC is most effective when losses are independent, it can not be expected to offer as much of a performance advantage in a real network. This is indeed a limitation of our work, and we address this further in the next section. In <ref> [1] </ref>, experiments were performed in which audio data was sent over the Internet with varying amounts of redundancy (in the form of the number of packets protected with a fixed encoding rate). <p> If a primary goal of Internet audio transmission is to get some information about each audio frame to the receiver, we can use the relative reward metric to interpret results <ref> [1] </ref>. A natural extension of our work is to study the performance of SFEC when protecting a variable number of previous packets with redundant encodings (i.e., when &gt; 1), as opposed to protecting just the single previous packet, as explored in this work.

Reference-contexts: The fewer MSBs kept, the lower the rate and the higher the distortion. Simulations for audio using SFEC in the form of this MSB scheme were considered in <ref> [2] </ref>. We assume that actual audio codecs can produce lower distortions at equivalent rates than this simple MSB scheme. Thus, we use the operational rate-distortion curve of the MSB scheme as a bound the theoretical rate-distortion curve of our model. <p> In our own prior work, we examined the case of a network carrying only audio traffic, with some sources using FEC and the others just sending unprotected PCM audio <ref> [2] </ref>. The results indicated that if few sources were using FEC, they could add a high bit-rate redundancy encoding and still improve performance. As the fraction of sources using FEC increased, the upper limit of how much FEC could be added and still result in performance gain decreased. <p> As the fraction of sources using FEC increased, the upper limit of how much FEC could be added and still result in performance gain decreased. The experimental scope of <ref> [2] </ref> is limited in that there is no non-audio traffic in the network, and a simplistic encoding was used for the FEC audio. Biersack [10] used simulations to study the performance that can be achieved by using FEC in ATM networks.

Reference-contexts: Naturally, these error-correcting capabilities incur a cost since the FEC codes represent redundant information that increases the overall transmission rate. Despite this cost, a new variant of FEC for Internet audio has recently been devised that, at least qualitatively, leads to greatly improved packet audio performance <ref> [3, 13, 1] </ref>.

Initial experience with this approach in the Robust Audio Codec from University College London <ref> [3] </ref> and the FreeP-hone tool from INRIA [13] has provided strong anecdotal evidence that the model is sound. Consequently, work is underway in the Internet Engineering Task Force to standardize a Real-time Transport Protocol [14] payload format for redundant audio data [15]. <p> Rather than attempt a fully comprehensive design of a congestion control scheme for packet audio, in this paper we explore, in depth, just one important piece of the congestion control puzzle. Namely, we elaborate the novel but ad hoc coding techniques proposed in <ref> [3] </ref> with a formal framework that we call signal processing-based FEC (SFEC). In turn, we use this framework to evaluate the efficacy of SFEC when used in aggregate across a large number of audio flows. <p> One alternative that avoids this coding delay is to simply do nothing in the audio stream itself, and instead rely upon error-concealment algorithms at the receiver to patch up the missing packet (s) <ref> [3, 17] </ref>. While perceptual models can be exploited to carry out effective concealment, oftentimes simpler techniques are employed where the receiver replaces missing audio segments with silence, white-noise, or a repeated segment. <p> While white-noise and packet-repetition are known to provide better reconstructions than silence substitution, Hardman et al.'s human subject studies show that substituting a low-quality version of the original frame enhances the subjective quality of reconstructed speech <ref> [3] </ref>. This novel approach in effect combines error-concealment and FEC by leveraging redundant information that is constructed at the source using signal processing-based coding (e.g., linear predictive coding) into in the error-concealment algorithm that runs at the receiver. <p> Furthermore, since the LPC encoding of audio frame 4 is also contained in this packet, and the higher-quality AD-PCM encoding was lost, frame 4 is decoded with distortion D 1 . As described in <ref> [3, 13, 1] </ref>, SFEC can be extended beyond a single redundant stream. In this extension, multiple sub-streams are coded at multiple rates (with successively lower quality) and are interlaced at increasing phase offsets. <p> Although this extension can improve performance, for simplicity we limit our analysis throughout this paper to the case where = 1. 3 Simulation Having re-cast the FEC scheme proposed in <ref> [3, 13, 1] </ref> into our SFEC framework, we are now prepared to elaborate this earlier work with a systematic evaluation of the overall efficacy of the approach.

Reference-contexts: Rather than devise new end-to-end schemes for accommodating packet loss, many network researchers believe that loss should be explicitly avoided or controlled by re-engineering the network to provide quality-of-service guarantees through techniques like admission control and reservation (e.g. as in RSVP <ref> [7] </ref>). Although this approach may one day prove viable, a number of hard, open problems remain unsolved and the administrative heterogeneity of service provider inter-relationships makes end-to-end deployment of such schemes very difficult.

We performed our simulations using the network simulator ns <ref> [18] </ref> with simple models for the network topology and traffic sources. The network model consists of a single bottleneck link and the workload consists of two traffic classes: some number of on/off constant bit-rate audio sources and a Poisson process that represents aggregate, background cross-traffic.

Reference-contexts: To account for differing levels of quality associated with different encoding rates for the source and redundancy, we evaluated several SFEC methods under a range of network conditions using a rate-distortion (R-D) model <ref> [22] </ref> for audio. The R-D model was an approximation for two reasons. First, a single distortion for a fixed rate coder is difficult to compute for a class of signals as broad as audio.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, even if we could accurately determine the average mean squared error (MSE) distortion, performance metrics based on MSE, such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), have INFOCOM March 1998 San Francisco, CA 5 been shown to be a poor estimator of subjective quality for a broad range of distortions <ref> [23] </ref>. Despite these limitations, a rate-distortion model can still give us insight into the benefits and tradeoffs of using SFEC. To ensure that our R-D curve had an approximately correct shape, we considered the following.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, because operational R-D curves typically can be modeled as negative exponen-tials, distortion decays rapidly at low rates. For example, we know that audio quality improves noticeably when moving from low- to medium-rate codings (e.g., 2.4 Kbps LPC-10 <ref> [24] </ref> to 16 Kbps ADPCM), but improves by a lesser degree when moving from medium- to high-rate codings (e.g., 32 Kbps ADPCM [25] to 64 Kbps PCM coding).

Incorporating a model of this nature would be ideal for our simulations, especially since the burstiness of the traffic has a large effect on the amount of lost packets that can be recovered with FEC.
