Title: On Levels in Arrangements of Lines, Segments, Planes, and Triangles  
Author: Pankaj K. Agarwal Boris Aronov Micha Sharir 
Date: December 13, 1996  
Abstract: We consider the problem of bounding the complexity of the k-th level in an arrangement of n curves or surfaces, a problem dual to, and extending, the well-known k-set problem. (a) We review and simplify some old proofs in new disguise and give new proofs of the bound O(n p k + 1) for the complexity of the k-th level in an arrangement of n lines. (b) We derive an improved version of Lovasz Lemma in any dimension, and use it to prove a new bound, O(n 2 k 2=3 ), on the complexity of the k-th level in an arrangement of n planes in R 3 , or on the number of k-sets in a set of n points in three dimensions. (c) We show that the complexity of any single level in an arrangement of n line segments in the plane is O(n 3=2 ), and that the complexity of any single level in an arrangement of n triangles in 3-space is O(n 17=6 ).

Reference-contexts: See Figure 4. We thus have P P i;j t ij nk, where the latter inequality follows from the fact that the number of chain-crossings is equal to the number of vertices of A (L) at level &lt; k, and this number is known to be at most nk <ref> [1] </ref>. This implies that jV k1 j (2n) 1=2 @ i;j 1 1=2 p Note that the constant of proportionality is better than those yielded by the earlier proofs. 2 3 Segment Arrangements In this section we extend some of the proofs given above to the case of line segments.

Reference-contexts: Introduction 3 passing through d of the points such that one of the halfspaces that they bound contains exactly k points of S. For d = 3, the best known upper and lower bounds are, respectively, O (n 8=3 ) and (n 2 log n) <ref> [3, 8] </ref>.

Finally, we consider the case of triangles in 3-space, and show that the complexity of a single level in an arrangement of n such triangles is O (n 17=6 ). 2 Line Arrangements Let L be a collection of n lines in the plane in general position.

Reference-contexts: It follows by a simple (and standard) counting argument (such as in <ref> [5, 18] </ref>) that must contain a point that lies in at least jV k1 j 2 =4n 2 intervals. Since this number cannot be more than 2k, we obtain jV k1 j 2 p p k.

Reference-contexts: More precisely, we measure the dihedral angle between h v;f and the upper half-hyperplane of H f bounded by f . We now adapt the analysis of Clarkson <ref> [6] </ref>, which gives a bound on the number of local maxima or minima of the x d -coordinate on the k-th level. <p> It is easily checked that, with some care, this property also holds for the dihedral angle function. We thus conclude, as in <ref> [6] </ref>, that the number of those local minima is k+d1 = O (k d1 ), which completes the proof of the lemma. 2 Proof of Theorem 4.1: Dey and Edelsbrunner [8] have shown that if T is a collection of t triangles in 3-space, spanned by n points in general position,

Reference-contexts: In spite of the sorry state of the problem, one can obtain nontrivial bounds when k is small. The probabilistic analysis of Clarkson and Shor <ref> [7] </ref> (see also [21]) yields fairly sharp bounds on the combined complexity of the first k levels in arrangements. For the case of hyperplanes, for example, the bound is fi (n bd=2c k dd=2e ). <p> For the case of hyperplanes, for example, the bound is fi (n bd=2c k dd=2e ). For sufficiently small k, this gives a better upper bound on the complexity of a single level than the general bound stated above. The analysis of Clarkson and Shor <ref> [7] </ref> also implies, under fairly general assumptions that, for a constant k &gt; 0, the worst-case number of vertices of the k-th level is asymptotically proportional to the maximum possible number of vertices on the lower envelope (i.e., the 0-th level) of the surfaces. New Results. <p> this improves the bound O (n 8=3 ) that was established in [8], when k t n, and is the first general bound for the case of planes that depends also on k, except for the O (nk 2 ) bound on the combined complexity of the first k levels <ref> [7] </ref>. Note that our new bound is smaller than this latter bound when k = (n 3=4 ). The proof of Theorem 4.1 follows the previous proofs in [2, 8]. That is, it exploits a generalization of Lovasz Lemma to three dimensions.

Reference-contexts: Introduction 3 passing through d of the points such that one of the halfspaces that they bound contains exactly k points of S. For d = 3, the best known upper and lower bounds are, respectively, O (n 8=3 ) and (n 2 log n) <ref> [3, 8] </ref>. For d &gt; 3, the best known upper bound is O (n dc d ), for some exponentially small but positive constant c d [25]. Note that, in contrast to the planar case, these bounds depend only on n and not on k. <p> The previous bound was O (n d1 ) (see [3, 18]), so this is a significant improvement when k t n. Plugging the new bound into the Levels in arrangements December 13, 1996 Line Arrangements 4 analysis technique of <ref> [8] </ref>, we show that the complexity of the k-th level in an arrangement of n planes in 3-space, and thus, the number of k-sets in a set of n points in R 3 , is O (n 2 k 2=3 ). <p> Theorem 4.1 The number of vertices of the k-th level of A (P ) is O (n 2 k 2=3 ). As already noted, this improves the bound O (n 8=3 ) that was established in <ref> [8] </ref>, when k t n, and is the first general bound for the case of planes that depends also on k, except for the O (nk 2 ) bound on the combined complexity of the first k levels [7]. <p> Note that our new bound is smaller than this latter bound when k = (n 3=4 ). The proof of Theorem 4.1 follows the previous proofs in <ref> [2, 8] </ref>. That is, it exploits a generalization of Lovasz Lemma to three dimensions. We present here an improved version of this lemma, in arbitrary dimension, which leads to the improved bound of the theorem. <p> We thus conclude, as in [6], that the number of those local minima is k+d1 = O (k d1 ), which completes the proof of the lemma. 2 Proof of Theorem 4.1: Dey and Edelsbrunner <ref> [8] </ref> have shown that if T is a collection of t triangles in 3-space, spanned by n points in general position, then there exists a line ` that crosses (t 3 =n 6 ) triangles of T . We dualize the setup in Lemma 4.2, for d = 3. <p> Moreover, f R v if and only if f fl crosses R fl v , as is easily verified. In other words, Lemma 4.2 implies that no line can cross more than O (k 2 ) of these triangles. Combining this with the result of <ref> [8] </ref>, we have jV k j 3 =n 6 = O (k 2 ), and the bound follows. 2 5 A Level in an Arrangement of Triangles Let T = f 1 ; : : : ; n g be a collection of n triangles in 3-space in general position, and <p> As in the proof of Theorem 4.1, there exists a line that crosses at least (X 3 =n 6 ) such triangles <ref> [8] </ref>. On the other hand, by Lemma 5.1, this number is at most O (n 5=2 ). Combining these two inequalities yields X = O (n 17=6 ). We still need to bound the number of vertices of type (b). <p> Note that there are two different problems to address: One is to extend Lovasz Lemma, and the other calls for a dual and more general version of the analysis technique of <ref> [8] </ref> (that yields a line that stabs many triangles). Acknowledgments. We wish to thank Janos Pach and Emo Welzl for useful discussions concerning these problems.

Reference-contexts: We also give a simple proof of the dual version of what we call "Lovasz Lemma" (see Lemma 2.3 below) that is used to prove the bound. As is well known, these techniques apply equally well to arrangements of pseudo-lines; see, for example, <ref> [11] </ref>. We adapt two of our proof techniques to yield the bound O (n 3=2 ) on the complexity of a single level in an arrangement of n line segments (or "pseudo-segments," to be defined below). As far as we know, this bound is new.

Reference-contexts: We review the proof technique of Gusfield <ref> [12] </ref>, which, as we perceive, is not well known within the combinatorial and computational geometry communities, and show its relationship to other proofs. We also give a simple proof of the dual version of what we call "Lovasz Lemma" (see Lemma 2.3 below) that is used to prove the bound. <p> First Proof (Potential Function): This proof is not new, and is an adaptation of the analysis technique of Gusfield <ref> [12, 13] </ref>. We give it for the sake of completeness, and because we will shortly apply a variant of it to the case of segments. We note that the way it is presented below is somewhat different than Gusfield's own analysis; we will further comment on Gusfield's analysis later on.

Reference-contexts: Gusfield's analysis, with minor modifications, essentially establishes the following more general bound. The same result has been obtained independently by Halperin and Sharir <ref> [14] </ref>, who were not aware of Gusfield's earlier work: Theorem 2.2 ([12, 13, 14]) The overall number of vertices of k concave chains, which are vertex-disjoint and have non-overlapping edges, in an arrangement of n lines in the plane, is O (n p This result clearly yields another proof Theorem 2.1. <p> Remarks: (1) If the concave chains are not allowed to cross each other, then their overall complexity is only O (k 2=3 n 2=3 + n), as shown in <ref> [14, 15] </ref>, but the analysis in these papers crucially relies on the fact that the chains cannot cross. (2) The chains associated with the k-th level have the additional property (iii) that all their vertices appear on their upper envelope.

Third Proof (Concave Chains and Lovasz Lemma): One of the standard (and among the first) ways to prove the theorem is via the following statement, which we will refer to as "Lovasz Lemma" [18].

That is, fix a vertical line , and intersect each W v , for v 2 V k1 , with , to obtain a system of jV k1 j intervals on , having a total of n endpoints (which are the intersections of the lines in L with ). <p> It follows by a simple (and standard) counting argument (such as in <ref> [5, 18] </ref>) that must contain a point that lies in at least jV k1 j 2 =4n 2 intervals. Since this number cannot be more than 2k, we obtain jV k1 j 2 p p k.

Reference-contexts: See Figure 1. In this section we give four proofs of the following well-known result (which, as already pointed out, provides an estimate which is slightly larger than the best currently known upper bound of Pach et al. <ref> [20] </ref>): Theorem 2.1 The complexity of the k-th level of A (L) is O (n p Remark: In most of the following proofs we will actually argue that jV k1 j = O (n p The claimed bound on the number of vertices of the k-th level follows by repeating the

Reference-contexts: In spite of the sorry state of the problem, one can obtain nontrivial bounds when k is small.

This is a better upper bound for small values of k. 2 Second Proof (Concave Chains and Lovasz Lemma): We next present a second proof, based on a variant of the dual Lovasz Lemma given above. We use the same setup as above.

Reference-contexts: In fact, in the case of segments, the bound O (n k + 1) is too small for small values of k. For example, for k = 0 (that is, for the lower envelope of the segments) the complexity of the level can be (nff (n)) <ref> [24] </ref>, which is larger than the above bound. On the other hand, the complexity of the k-th level is smaller than the overall complexity of the first k levels, which is O (n (k + 1)ff (n=(k + 1))) [21].
