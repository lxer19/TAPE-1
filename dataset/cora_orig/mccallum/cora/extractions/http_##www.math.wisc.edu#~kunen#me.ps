Abstract: We consider axioms asserting that Lebesgue measure on the real line may be extended to measure a few new non-measurable sets. Strong versions of such axioms, such as real-valued measurability, involve large cardinals, but weak versions do not. We discuss weak versions which are sufficient to prove various combinatorial results, such as the non-existence of Ramsey ultrafilters, the existence of ccc spaces whose product is not ccc, and the existence of Sand L- spaces. We also prove an absoluteness theorem stating that assuming our axiom, every sentence of an appropriate logical form which is forced to be true in the random real extension of the universe is in fact already true.

Reference-contexts: To see this, observe that M E ! is false if the well-order on the cardinal c is in the -algebra generated by rectangles, since, by Fubini's Theorem, the sides of the rectangles will form a countable collection of subsets of c (equivalently, of <ref> [0; 1] </ref>) which cannot be measured by any atomless -additive probability measure. In particular, by [12] or [19], M E ! is false under CH or M A. Furthermore, suppose the ground model V satisfies M A + :CH. <p> If E is uncountable, then S E may fail to be measurable.

We now present a probabilistic argument showing that the set of all these H can never have the finite intersection property, so that there can be no semi-selective ultrafilters.

The justification for using this particular f is only that it makes Theorem 4.3 true.

A small process for a random I-sequence is a set H X fi I such that for each x 2 X, H x is x small, and for each i 2 I, H i is -measurable. <p> Corollary 4.5 ME ! implies that there are no semi-selective ultrafilters. 4 RAMSEY ULTRAFILTERS. 19 Proof: Let U be a semi-selective ultrafilter on !. Let X be <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! with the usual product measure. Let x = x. For each x, choose H x 2 U such that H x is x -small. This defines H X fi !. <p> Applying ME ! , let extend the usual product measure on X and measure all the H i . Then Corollary 4.4 yields an immediate contradiction. Later, in proving Theorem 4.9, it will be important that Theorem 4.3 was stated for X an arbitrary sample space, not just <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! . Note that Corollary 4.4 has a non-vacuous content just in ZF C, since it is easy to find Borel small processes H [0; 1] ! fi ! such that each H x is infinite.

Note that h is Borel measurable. <p> that Corollary 4.4 has a non-vacuous content just in ZF C, since it is easy to find Borel small processes H <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! fi ! such that each H x is infinite. We turn now to a proof of Theorem 4.3. We first consider finite products. For each 2 [0; 1] n , let h () be the largest size of a small set. Note that h is Borel measurable. For n 0, let n be the expected value of h (): n = h () d () It is easy to see that 0 1 2 . <p> Proof. First note that f 0 is positive and f 00 is negative on (0; 1), which implies that f is increasing on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and f (a + b) f (a) + f (b) whenever 0 a; b a + b 1. Also, the inverse of f is a "small" exponential. If y = 100=(ln (x) 2) then x = e 2 e 100=y . <p> Also, the inverse of f is a "small" exponential. If y = 100=(ln (x) 2) then x = e 2 e 100=y . Now, fix n; r, and let S = f 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> n : h () 2rg. Then, n (2r 1) + n (S). To estimate (S), fix 2 S and then fix H n such that jHj = 2r and H is -small.

Now, for each particular i 6= j, f 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> n : f (j (i) (j)j) 1=rg 2e 2 e 100r . Since there are 2 n 2 =2 possibilities for i; j, we have (S) n 2 e 2 e 100r , proving the lemma. <p> We continue the notation of xx2,3, forcing with B . We continue to use to denote Lebesgue measure on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> or any power thereof, and to denote the usual measure on any power of 2 = f0; 1g. Definition 4.2 For any set I, a random I-sequence-name is a name in the forcing language such that k : I ! [0; 1]k = 1, and for each Baire B <p> continue to use to denote Lebesgue measure on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> or any power thereof, and to denote the usual measure on any power of 2 = f0; 1g. Definition 4.2 For any set I, a random I-sequence-name is a name in the forcing language such that k : I ! [0; 1]k = 1, and for each Baire B [0; 1] I , (k 2 Bk) = (B). Note that in the formalism of forcing, inside the k k, I should really be I, whereas B should really be a Borel code (see [17]), not B. <p> Definition 4.2 For any set I, a random I-sequence-name is a name in the forcing language such that k : I ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>k = 1, and for each Baire B [0; 1] I , (k 2 Bk) = (B). Note that in the formalism of forcing, inside the k k, I should really be I, whereas B should really be a Borel code (see [17]), not B. <p> We point out here that, at least for small , our results about M E are best possible. First, we note that in the axiom M E ! , one cannot replace <ref> [0; 1] </ref> by an arbitrary measure space. For example (Theorem 9 of Rao [19]), consider the measure space (! 1 ; ), where countable sets have measure 0, co-countable sets have measure 1, and other sets are not -measurable. <p> The following lemma and corollary also use this method of proof. 6 ADDITIONAL REMARKS. 29 Lemma 6.1 Suppose Y <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and suppose Y ff % Y as ff % fl, where fl is some limit ordinal and each Y ff is a Lebesgue nullset.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION. 5 A Ramsey (or, selective) ultrafilter is a nonprincipal ultrafilter U on ! such that every partition : [!] 2 ! 2 has a homogeneous set in U . As is well known <ref> [2] </ref>, this implies that for each finite n, U is also Ramsey for partitions on n-tuples. Under CH or M A, there is a Ramsey ultrafilter, as is easily seen by W. Rudin's construction [21] of a P -point ultrafilter.

Reference-contexts: Proof: If not, then by Proposition 2.12, each uncountable ffi c fails to be rveee, so by Corollary 2.9, M A c (1rr) holds, which is impossible. So, as Carlson notes in <ref> [3] </ref> by a somewhat different argument, M E c is equiconsistent with the existence of a weakly compact cardinal. 3 An Absoluteness Result. In this section, we describe our absoluteness result for random real models and use it to prove Theorem 1.3. <p> By induction on ff &lt; + , prove that each E ff ~ is --measurable. Now, the E ff ~ form a --measurable Ulam matrix, which yields an immediate contradiction. In <ref> [3] </ref>, Carlson proves this for the case c. For this case, his argument is much simpler than ours.

It is easy to see that every weakly compact cardinal is rveee in every random real extension, so that a rveee cardinal c is equiconsistent with a weakly compact cardinal.

Reference-contexts: B is the measure algebra with which one forces to add random reals. This is equivalent to forcing with the Baire sets of positive measure, as in <ref> [17] </ref>. When just doing forcing, it is somewhat simpler to use the Baire sets, rather than their equivalence classes, but when discussing algebraic properties, such as suprema, it is somewhat simpler to work with the Boolean algebra. <p> Note that in the formalism of forcing, inside the k k, I should really be I, whereas B should really be a Borel code (see <ref> [17] </ref>), not B. Lemma 4.8 Suppose that 1 and 2 are random I-sequence-names and suppose that t 1 and t 2 names in the forcing language such that each t ` is forced by 1 to be a subset of I and to be ` -small (` = 1; 2). <p> Let Z = 2 . In the case of random real forcing, it is more convenient to think of the generic object as an object z 2 Z which is random over V (that is, not in any V -coded Baire nullset), rather than a generic filter (see <ref> [17] </ref>). To prove the lemma, it is sufficient to find some z random over V such that jval (t 1 ; z) " val (t 2 ; z)j 1 (where val refers to the value of a name in the generic extension).

Reference-contexts: A nonprincipal ultrafilter satisfying property (2) is sometimes called "rapid". There are none of these in the Laver model (Miller <ref> [18] </ref>), but when we add random reals, any extension of a rapid ultrafilter from the ground model will still be a rapid ultrafilter. Satisfying property (1) is equivalent to being a P-point, and by a result of P. E.

Reference-contexts: In particular, by [12] or <ref> [19] </ref>, M E ! is false under CH or M A. Furthermore, suppose the ground model V satisfies M A + :CH. <p> We can get an S of size ! 2 , as we explain after proving Theorem 2.2. Our proof employs the following ancient fact (proved in Kunen [12] and Rao <ref> [19] </ref>) about ! 1 fi ! 1 . 2 PRESERVING SUPREMA. 8 Theorem 2.6 Each subset of ! 1 fi! 1 is in a -algebra generated by countably many rectangles of the form B fi C, where B; C ! 1 . <p> We point out here that, at least for small , our results about M E are best possible. First, we note that in the axiom M E ! , one cannot replace [0; 1] by an arbitrary measure space. For example (Theorem 9 of Rao <ref> [19] </ref>), consider the measure space (! 1 ; ), where countable sets have measure 0, co-countable sets have measure 1, and other sets are not -measurable.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, the product P 0 fi P 1 isn't ccc: consider the subset fhfffg; fffgi : ff &lt; ! 1 g. Galvin [9] showed that under CH there is a graph such that P 0 and P are both ccc.

Reference-contexts: As is well known [2], this implies that for each finite n, U is also Ramsey for partitions on n-tuples. Under CH or M A, there is a Ramsey ultrafilter, as is easily seen by W. Rudin's construction <ref> [21] </ref> of a P -point ultrafilter. It is already known [14] that there are no Ramsey ultrafilters in the model obtained by adding at least c + random reals. Using this method of proof, Fremlin [8] shows that a real-valued measurable cardinal refutes the existence of Ramsey ultrafilters.

Reference-contexts: Since A is fixed here, we write "'" instead of "A j= '". If is real-valued measurable, then by the method of <ref> [22] </ref>, Theorem 3.1 holds for all 1 n properties. Of course, the theorem holds also for = !, but is trivial in that case by Shoenfield's Theorem. <p> This argument may be viewed either as an attempt to produce the Ulam matrix by just measuring sets, or as an attempt to apply Solovay's <ref> [22] </ref> Boolean ultrapower technique to the R ff to produce, in some random real extension, a well-order of of type + . Let I be the family of all X + such that X S ~&lt; N ~ for some sequence N ~ of -nullsets.

Reference-contexts: In addition, using our absoluteness result to prove Theorem 1.3 (2) requires the fact that random real forcing never destroys S-spaces and L-spaces. Similarly, Todorcevic' construction of an entangled set (see page 55 of <ref> [25] </ref>) gives us Theorem 1.3 (3). Actually, he shows that adding one random real adds an entangled set of size continuum. Thus, we get: Theorem 3.5 Assume M E , where ! 1 and no uncountable ff is rveee.

Reference-contexts: Proof. Note that if we allowed E to have size + , there would be an obvious Ulam <ref> [26] </ref> matrix argument here, but to get E of size , we need a bit more care. For each ff &lt; + , let R ff well-order in type at least ff.
