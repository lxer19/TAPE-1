Abstract: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a rare but very aggressive tumor. Many factors that might influence the survival of patients have been suggested. The aim of our study was to determine which of the factors, known at the time of admission to the hospital, might predict survival of patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Our aim was also to assess the relative importance of the factors and to identify potentially useful decision and regression trees generated by machine learning algorithms. Our study included 126 patients (90 females and 36 males; mean age was 66.7 years) with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma treated at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana from 1972 to 1992. Patients were classified into categories according to 11 attributes: sex, age, history, physical findings, extent of disease on admission, and tumor morphology. In this paper we compare the machine learning approach with the previous statistical evaluations on the problem (uni-variate and multivariate analysis) and show that it can provide more thorough analysis and improve understanding of the data.

Similar results can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. 5 Discussion The results we obtained largely confirm the physicians' prior knowledge about the problem. The highly ranked attributes are mostly as they suspected. However, their speculation that the prior radioactive therapy causes cancer a few years later could not be confirmed. <p> On the other hand, absence of distant metastases and slow growth rate of the tumor suggest much longer survival. This not entirely new to the physicians; they have already speculated that this might be the case <ref> [3] </ref>; * it efficiently pointed out the unfair attributes; Namely, the original dataset consisted of 13 attributes. However, some of the attributes were evaluated during (or after) the treatment period and were therefore not present at admission (e.g. the adequacy of the treatment). <p> Assistant-I and Assistant-R have positioned these attributes at the root of the trees, achieving 75-80% of classification accurracy. It is controversial whether treatment is a prognostic factor at all because it is not present on admission <ref> [3] </ref>. The aim of our study was to determine which factors, that are known at the time of admission to hospital, predict survival of patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, so we decided not to include treatment in our analysis.

The experimental system CORE (COntinuous RElief) uses an extended version of ReliefF - RReliefF [23] which is capable of correctly estimating the quality of attributes in continuous class problems with strong dependencies between attributes. RReliefF is a cousin of ReliefF working on continuous class problems and is capable of detecting conditional dependencies between the attributes.

As anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a rare disease [11], till now, only a few series of patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma large enough to enable multivariate statistical analysis of prognostic factors and survival were published [1, 2, 3, 12, 20, 26].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a very aggressive tumor with poor prognosis [1, 11]. Mean survival time is from 2.5 [11] to 7 months [26]; only occasionally, patients survive beyond five years <ref> [1, 2, 25] </ref>. Many factors that might influence the survival of patients have been suggested. They are the following: presence of metastases [3, 26], growth rate of the tumor [3], age [26], focal anaplastic carcinoma [1, 3], tumor size [3], and treatment [3].

But only Nel [20] and Besic [3] used Cox's proportional hazard survival model [8, 9].
