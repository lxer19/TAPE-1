Abstract: A mobile system for space shuttle servicing, the Tessellator, has been configured, designed and is currently being built and integrated. Robot tasks include chemical injection and inspection of the shuttles thermal protection system. This paper outlines tasks, rationale, and facility requirements for the development of this system. A detailed look at the mobile system and manipulator follow with a look at mechanics, electronics, and software. Salient features of the mobile robot include omnidirectionality, high reach, high stiffness and accuracy with safety and self-reliance integral to all aspects of the design. The robot system is shown to meet task, facility, and NASA requirements in its design resulting in unprecedented specifications for a mobile-manipulation system.

Reference-contexts: The Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and a committed group at NASA felt strongly that the time was right to investigate both applications and technologies for ground processing. In 1990 we investigated the automation of a variety of ground processing applications <ref> [NASA-TPS 90, NASA-PPS 90] </ref>. The studies not only concluded that there were tasks worth automating but that current robotic technologies made this automation possible. Of the many tasks in ground processing of spacecraft and payloads, we focused on the Thermal Protection System (TPS) of the Space Shuttle.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, the planner interfaces to the bar code navigation scanner. The planner consists of a Sun Sparc-2 class processor running the SunOS operating system. All of the on-board systems are interconnected with an Ethernet local area network. Communication between the systems is via CMUs Task Control Architecture (TCA) <ref> [Simmons 91] </ref>, which provides communication between software modules, goal tree generation and execution, resource management, and rudimentary error recovery. Off-board the robot is the Work Cell Controller, which is discussed in Section 9. 5.6. Software Software comprises a large and critical portion of the entire system.
