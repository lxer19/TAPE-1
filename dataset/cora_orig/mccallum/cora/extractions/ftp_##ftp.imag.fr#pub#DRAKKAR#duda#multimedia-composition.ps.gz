Abstract: Many existing models for temporal composition of multimedia data are based on the Allen relations [1]. However, the relations are not suitable for composition: they are descriptive (do not reflect causal dependency between intervals), they depend on interval durations (changing duration may modify relations), and they may lead to temporal inconsistency (contradictory relations specified for intervals). We define a set of operators expressing causal relations between intervals. They can be used to form nested interval expressions. Interval expressions are independent of interval durations and allow encapsulation and structured nesting, so that it is possible to define complex multimedia presentations in a well-structured manner.

Reference-contexts: For example, user interactions make the durations of media segments unknown or unpredictable. In addition to that, the constructs must allow encapsulation and structured nesting. Many existing models for temporal composition of multimedia data are based on the Allen relations <ref> [1] </ref>. However, the relations are not suitable for temporal composition. First, the relations are descriptive: they do not reflect causal dependency between intervals, but they rather represent temporal coincidence. Second, since the relations depend on interval duration, changing duration may modify the relation that exists between the intervals. <p> Relations change when the interval duration is modified. Interval-based models consider elementary media entities as time intervals ordered according to some relations. Existing models are mainly based on the relations defined by Allen for expressing the knowledge about time <ref> [1] </ref>. Giving any two intervals, they can be arranged according to seven relations : before, meets, overlaps, finishes, during, starts, equals. However, using Allen relations for multimedia composition faces several problems. <p> The third problem with the Allen relations is related to inconsistent specifications that can be introduced to a multimedia presentation. Detecting inconsistent specification requires algorithms of complexity [O (N 2 )], where N is the number of intervals <ref> [1] </ref>. Some authors propose to use the Allen relations to specify a multimedia database schema. For example, Little and Ghafoor propose an OCPN model equivalent to the Allen relations [11, 12].

Reference-contexts: We can also compare our approach to structured document processing as opposed to traditional text formatters such as T E X. Structured documents are treated as compound objects corresponding to the document's logical composition <ref> [2] </ref>. Their composition may be restricted to fit the structure. On the opposite, T E X allows almost not constrained composition resulting in confusing documents that are difficult to modify and maintain. Our temporal composition model fits well object-oriented databases.

Reference-contexts: The model is well suited for temporal composition of media segments of known durations, however it falls short for unknown durations. Other authors have proposed to use relations between interval end points for temporal composition of multimedia (temporal point nets <ref> [3] </ref>, MME [6]). However, their use is difficult and results in complicated, unstructured graphs. In addition to that, their use may lead to an inconsistent specification in which 3 contradictory conditions are specified for intervals. In this case, a verification algorithm (called sometimes a temporal formatter) must check for inconsistency [3]. <p> <ref> [3] </ref>, MME [6]).

This issue is similar to the debate on the structured approach to programming or on parallel programming constructs (fork-join <ref> [4] </ref> versus cobegin-coend [5]). In the structured approach to programming, some constructs such as goto are eliminated in order to simplify program structure. However, some programs that use goto statement cannot be expressed using structured programming constructs.

Reference-contexts: They propose an algorithm for constructing a database schema from temporal relations, however, when interval durations are modified, the schema must be modified too. King proposes a different formalism based on an interval temporal logic <ref> [10] </ref>. He shows how the Allen relations can be expressed using temporal logic formula. Although his formalism has solid mathematical bases, composition of multimedia presentations using declarative formula is awkward|logic formula do not correspond to the mental image that an author uses in conception.

Reference-contexts: In the remainder of this paper, we present existing models (Section 2), analyze possible arrangements between two time intervals (Section 3), present the proposed composition model (Section 4), and outline conclusions (Section 5). 2 Existing models Existing temporal models for multimedia can be divided into two classes: point-based and interval-based <ref> [13] </ref>. In point-based models, the elementary units are points in a time space. Each event in the model has its associated time point. The time points arranged according to some relations such as precede, simultaneous or after form complex multimedia presentations.

Reference-contexts: Interval expressions provide a means of encapsulation and structuring: compound encapsulated intervals can be specified in terms of elementary media objects as building blocks. We build upon the previous work on Algebraic Video <ref> [14] </ref> that uses a set of basic operations on video segments to create a desired video stream. The video algebra consists of operations for temporally and spatially combining video segments, and for attaching attributes to these segments. <p> Unlike previous models, interval expressions offer a different paradigm that allow specification in a structured manner of causal (or functional) relations between intervals of unknown duration. We explore 5 the same approach as Algebraic Video <ref> [14] </ref> that uses a set of basic operations on video segments. The video algebra defines three temporal operators for combining video segments: concatenation, parallel and parallel-end. Other operators such as union, are related to attributes and content-based access. 3 Analysis of interval relations Our elementary entities are time intervals.
