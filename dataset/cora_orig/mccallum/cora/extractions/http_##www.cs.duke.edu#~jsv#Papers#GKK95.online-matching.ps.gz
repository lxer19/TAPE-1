Abstract: We present a natural online perfect matching problem motivated by problems in mobile computing. A total of n customers connect and disconnect sequentially, and each customer has an associated set of stations to which it may connect. Each station has a capacity limit. We allow the network to preemptively switch a customer between allowed stations to make room for a new arrival. We wish to minimize the total number of switches required to provide service to every customer. Equivalently, we wish to maintain a perfect matching between customers and stations and minimize the lengths of the augmenting paths. We measure performance by the worst case ratio of the number of switches made to the minimum number required. When customers do not disconnect and the station capacity is 1, we achieve a competitive ratio of O(log n). There is a lower bound of ( p n) when the station capacities are 2. We present optimal algorithms when the station capacity is arbitrary in special cases.

Reference-contexts: When the capacities are arbitrary, the main difficulty is that there can be many non-disjoint augmenting paths for a new connect request. Our generalization of Rand defines a resistive network <ref> [CDR] </ref> of the augmenting paths and switches a path proportional to the current that would flow through it when a unit voltage is placed at the new connect request point.

Reference-contexts: The most probable way this will happen will be for the customers to connect to a local "station" through a cellular connection or a wireless LAN, using infrared technology or radio frequency <ref> [Dav] </ref>, and then access the sites of their choice via wired links, e.g., the Internet. The bottleneck in the mobile interconnection process is the wireless link connecting a customer to a mobile support station (MSS).
