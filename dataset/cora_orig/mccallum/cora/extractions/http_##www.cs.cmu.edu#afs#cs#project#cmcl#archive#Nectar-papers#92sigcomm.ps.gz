Abstract: Reducing latency has traditionally been the biggest For multicomputer applications, the most important challenge. Dedicated multicomputers with special-purpose performance parameters of a network is the latency for interconnects such as the Intel Touchstone system have short messages. In this paper we present an analysis of latencies below 100 microseconds [4], while latencies communication latency using measurement of the between Unix workstations communicating over general Nectar system. Nectar is a high-performance fast, simple network interface (the coprocessors). We networks have to cover much larger distances and study how much context switching, buffer management introduce errors in the data stream with non-zero and protocol processing contribute to the probability. The communication protocols that recover communication latency and we discuss how the latency from these errors introduce overhead, thus adding to the is influenced by the protocol implementation. networks are typically one order of magnitude higher.
