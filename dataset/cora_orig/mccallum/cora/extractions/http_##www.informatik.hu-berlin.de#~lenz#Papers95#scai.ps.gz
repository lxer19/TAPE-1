Title: Lazy Induction Triggered by CBR

Keyword: Case-based reasoning, rule induction, lazy induction.

Abstract: In recent years, case-based reasoning has been demonstrated to be highly useful for problem solving in complex domains. Also, mixed paradigm approaches emerged for combining CBR and induction techniques aiming at verifying the knowledge and/or building an efficient case memory. However, in complex domains induction over the whole problem space is often not possible or too time consuming. In this paper, an approach is presented which (owing to a close interaction with the CBR part) attempts to induce rules only for a particular context, i.e. for a problem just being solved by a CBR-oriented system. These rules may then be used for indexing purposes or similarity assessment in order to support the CBR process in the future.

Reference-contexts: Since the rules only cover parts of the problem space, these can be used for indexing purposes, similarity assessment and so on. They can not be used for a rule-based problem solver (as e.g. [16, 20]) or to build tree-like memory structures (as in <ref> [4, 5, 12, 22] </ref>). * To efficiently access all the cases satisfying certain criteria in order to test for predictivity (see section 3.1), an associative memory-like retrieval ([10]) is used. Tab. 2 contains the criteria of Tab. 1 for the lazy induction approach.

Reference-contexts: Hence the learning speed can hardly be measured. In general, the advantages of using rule-based knowledge within a CBR system have been worked out elsewhere (cf. e.g. [18, 19]); and the integration of rules into the CaBaTa system (cf. <ref> [7, 8, 9] </ref>) already caused a significant speed-up of the systems performance. However, up to now it was not clear how relevant rules can be obtained for specific domains.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, it is questionable whether rules should be constructed that cover all possible situations | regardless whether these will ever occur. Prototype-Based Learning (PBL), as introduced in <ref> [20] </ref> differs from ID3-like approaches in that it learns prototypical attributes while ID3 learns discriminant attributes. Furthermore, PBL can learn context-dependent attribute importances, too. <p> Since the rules only cover parts of the problem space, these can be used for indexing purposes, similarity assessment and so on.
