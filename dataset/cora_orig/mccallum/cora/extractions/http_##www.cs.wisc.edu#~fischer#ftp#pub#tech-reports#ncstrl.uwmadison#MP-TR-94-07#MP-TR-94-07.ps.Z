Title: The GAMS Callable Program Library for Variational and Complementarity Solvers  
Author: Steven P. Dirkse Michael C. Ferris Paul V. Preckel Thomas Rutherford 
Date: July 19, 1994  
Abstract: The GAMS modeling language has recently been extended to enable the formulation of Mixed Complementarity Problems (MCP). The GAMS Callable Program Library (CPLIB) is a set of Fortran subroutines developed as an extension for the GAMS I/O library and designed to provide a simple and convenient interface to the MCP defined by a GAMS model. This paper provides technical documentation for CPLIB for use by those who are developing or have developed algorithms for MCP, in order that their solvers may be made available as GAMS subsystems.

Reference-contexts: It will be the modeler's job to choose an appropriate solution algorithm for a particular application. A number of economists currently use GAMS for economic equilibrium analysis. These models typically use a nonlinear optimizer such as MINOS (Murtagh & Saunders 1983) or CONOPT <ref> (Drud 1985) </ref> to solve square systems of smooth nonlinear equations. We believe that there will be significant interest among these practitioners in solvers for nonsmooth systems of equations, provided the algorithms are sufficiently robust and efficient.
