Abstract: A network-based real-time control architecture has been developed which integrates a haptic interface (the Sarcos Dextrous Arm Master) with an advanced CAD modeling system (Utah's Alpha 1). New algorithms have been developed and tested for surface proximity testing, fast updates to local closest point on a surface, and smooth transitions between surfaces. The combination of these new algorithms with the haptic interface and CAD modeling system permits a user to actively touch and manipulate virtual parts as well as passively view them on a CRT screen.

Reference-contexts: Point Set Intermediate Representation The point set representation uses the approximate closest point as a center point in a mesh of surface points evaluated at fixed parametric intervals (Figure 4). This surface evaluation is efficiently done through multiple knot insertions at the desired parametric locations using the Oslo algorithm <ref> (Cohen et al., 1980) </ref>. The surface normals can also be extracted from the refined surface (Riesenfeld et al, 1981). These points and normals are used to represent the local geometry in the micro.

Reference-contexts: First, we project the end effector point onto the control mesh of the NURBS surface. Each vertex of the control polygon has an associated (u; v) parametric value <ref> (Cohen and Schumaker, 1985) </ref>, so by interpolating between vertex values using the barycentric coordinates of the projection, we determine an approximate (u; v) for the projected point.

Reference-contexts: From experience we find that n = 0:5 provides a good response. Furthermore, we have adopted the force impulse model of <ref> (Ellis et al., 1996) </ref>, which avoids active surfaces (energy gained during collisions) due to lag introduced by discretization. Stick-Slip Friction Aside from normal forces, adding tangential forces due to friction is properly required for realistic interactions.

Reference-contexts: The closest point is the nearest root of Eq. 1. However, the system may involve high degree polynomials, making the solution numerically difficult. The CAD community has methods of tracking points on surfaces during intersection operations <ref> (Hoschek and Lasser, 1993) </ref>. Many of these methods find the Euclidean closest point directly, requiring surface-plane intersections to be computed. These methods are too slow for haptic environments. Barnhill and Kersey (1990) developed a parametric marching algorithm for closest point tracking that minimizes error to a first order surface approximation.

Reference-contexts: The workstation must determine when surfaces are in near enough proximity to the master's location to be sent to the micro, and what portion of the model must be sent. As a rough check for surface proximity, we use bounding boxes around each surface <ref> (Johnson and Cohen, 1997) </ref>. Distance from a point to a bounding box is a trivial computation, and we can quickly discard the majority of the surfaces in the environment. <p> Some specific components are * Support for moving surfaces. * Introduction of trimmed NURBS models as are com mon in mechanical design. * Use of real-time surface-surface closest point and colli sion detection <ref> (Johnson and Cohen, 1997) </ref>. * Use of sound as additional feedback. * Assembly data structures for verification and assembly analysis. * Wall models to represent surface properties. * Immersive environments for design.

Reference-contexts: DYNAMICAL INTERACTIONS At the moment, our dynamics modeling is limited to surface interaction. A key issue is the choice of a compliance model or a stiffness model for the interaction of the Master with a virtual assembly <ref> (Yoshikawa and Ueda, 1996) </ref>. We have chosen a stiffness model, where the user generates positions against the virtual assembly and the simulation returns forces. This approach is well suited for the Sar-cos Master, which is a better force source than a position source.
