Title: Lexical Discovery with an Enriched Semantic Network  
Author: Doug Beeferman

Abstract: The study of lexical semantics has produced a systematic analysis of binary relationships between content words that has greatly benefited lexical search tools and natural language processing algorithms. We first introduce a database system called FreeNet that facilitates the description and exploration of finite binary relations. We then describe the design and implementation of Lexical FreeNet, a semantic network that mixes WordNet-derived semantic relations with data-derived and phonetically-derived relations. We discuss how Lexical FreeNet has aided in lexical discovery, the pursuit of linguistic and factual knowledge by the computer-aided exploration of lexical relations.

Reference-contexts: The highest-ranked pairs tend to be distance-one bigram phrases, while the remainder co-occur at greater distances. "Specializes" ( SPC =)) and "Generalizes" ( GEN The specialization relation captures the lexical inheritance system underlying WordNet nouns (Miller, 1990) and verbs <ref> (Fellbaum, 1990) </ref>. It is computed by taking, for each pair of WordNet synsets that appear as parent and child in the WordNet hyponym trees, the cross-product of the pair. For example, shoe SPC =) footwear. The generalization relation is simply the inverse of specialization relation, or SPC-.

Reference-contexts: This is perhaps best described as a "wormhole" in lexical space. Extensions A portion of the wealth of WordNet was discarded in Lexical FreeNet|the verb entailment relation, for instance. Adjectives are somewhat slighted by the system, as their WordNet description in terms of bipolar attributes <ref> (Gross and Miller, 1990) </ref> is largely ignored. Other possible semantic relations include the more specialized knowledge-engineered links that appear in typically narrow-coverage semantic nets, such as "acts on", "uses", "stronger than", and the like.

Reference-contexts: We can formalize this problem by asking for an ordering that minimizes the average offset difference between a randomly chosen edge in the multigraph. This problem is at least as computationally hard as the well-studied, NP-complete bandwidth problem in graph theory <ref> (Papadimitriou, 1976) </ref>, which is to find a linear ordering of the vertices of a given graph such that the maximum difference in the ordering between any two adjacent vertices is minimal.

Reference-contexts: Data-driven approaches to relation induction that dig deeper than the collocation extraction of the trigger computation may prove useful and interesting. One approach (Richardson, 1997; Richardson et al., 1993) bootstraps a parser to induce many unconventional semantic relations from dictionary data. A link grammar <ref> (Sleator and Temperley, 1991) </ref> applied to data can conceivably be used to extract some in teresting relations that live at the syntax/semantics interface. 4 Lexical discovery A World Wide Web interface to Lexical FreeNet, depicted in Figure 3, is available and has become a popular online resource since its release in
