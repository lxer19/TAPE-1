Reference-contexts: an arbitrary IB 0 IB, and consider the possible influence of the choice of the constants := f x g x on dim K (IB 0 ) (such considerations are intimately related to the notions of "algebraic multiplicity" and "geometric multiplicity" of a zero of an analytic ideal, cf., e.g., <ref> [AGV] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: It was the ingenious idea of Dahmen and Micchelli [DM3] to study the relation between the dimension of K and the dimensions of the "block spaces" K (fBg), B 2 IB. Their work was stimulated by two nontrivial examples that occur in box spline theory (cf. [BH], [DM1], [DM2], <ref> [BeR] </ref>, [DM3]), one of which we now describe. 1 Example 1.1. <p> It is much harder to prove here that (1:2) dim K = #IB: This result was proved first for the case = 0 in [DM1] (see also [HS]), and for the general case in <ref> [BeR] </ref> and [DM3]. Note that (1.2) can also be written as (1:3) dim K = B2IB and it was Dahmen and Micchelli's observation in [DM3] that this latter formulation holds in more general settings which started research into these matters. <p> This results in a binary (or higher-order) tree decomposition of IB. The only two noninductive results that we are aware of are the complex-variable proof in <ref> [BeR] </ref> that shows that in Example 1.1 one has dim K #IB; and the polynomial ideal argument in [BR] that shows that in Example 1.1 one has (1:5) dim K (IB 0 ) #IB 0 for an arbitrary subset IB 0 IB (as matter of fact, the argument in [BeR] also <p> in <ref> [BeR] </ref> that shows that in Example 1.1 one has dim K #IB; and the polynomial ideal argument in [BR] that shows that in Example 1.1 one has (1:5) dim K (IB 0 ) #IB 0 for an arbitrary subset IB 0 IB (as matter of fact, the argument in [BeR] also implies (1.5), but no formal statement to that extent is made there). The latter result (1.5) is of particular interest because it proves lower bounds while the matching upper bounds might be invalid; moreover, these lower bounds require no IB-conditions.

We note that, in <ref> [DM3] </ref>, (iii) is obtained under the (explicit) assumption that every compatible independent system (C; ') is solvable and the (implicit) assumption that any IB-special compatible independent system (C; ') actually has solutions in K.

Reference-contexts: We are unaware of noninductive methods for the derivation of upper bounds. (The proof in [BR] that shows equality to hold in (1.5) in case IB is order-closed is only seemingly noninductive, since it invokes a result from <ref> [DR] </ref> which is proved there by an inductive method.) As for inductive arguments, all those that we are aware of (including, thus, those of the present paper) require some IB-conditions and, moreover, the IB-conditions which are known to suffice for lower bounds imply matching upper bounds as a by-product.

Reference-contexts: This means that we are led to require the intersection condition, (2:5) 8fH; H 0 2 IH ny g IB y [H " IB y [H 0 = ;; unless H = H 0 ; first suggested by Jia, in <ref> [J] </ref>. 6 Lemma 2.6. The intersection condition (2.5) is satisfied (for y) if and only if, for every B 2 IB jy , there is at most one H 2 IH ny containing Bny. Proof. <p> Further, since y 2 X (IB), #IB ny &lt; #IB, and since IB ny 6= ;, by assumption, also #IB y [H &lt; #IB, H 2 IH. Therefore, induction together with (2.3) finishes the proof. 29 We have been reminded that this proposition was already proved in <ref> [J] </ref>, with the `intersection conditions' used there enforcing, by Proposition 2.8, what we have called here `fair'. Theorem 8.10. Suppose that IB (of rank s) is fair and G is s-additive. Then, for arbitrary ` : X ! G with dim K &lt; 1, dim K = B2IB Proof.

Reference-contexts: But, for each fixed matroidal IB and ` : X ! G, (iii) is equivalent to (i) of Theorem 5.2 which says that any special compatible basic system is solvable. We note that a comparison of s-additivity and the solvability condition 3.2 has also been made in <ref> [JRS2] </ref>. In particular, [JRS2: Theorem (2.11)] can be derived from Proposition 8.2 and Corollary 5.3. The following lemma will play an important role in the proof of the main induction step in the next theorem.

Reference-contexts: Before making use of this condition, it is perhaps useful to compare it to the solvability condition 3.2 placed on ` in x3, as is done in the following proposition which also fully answers the question raised in <ref> [RJS] </ref>. 27 Proposition 8.2. G is s-additive if and only if, for every matroidal IB and every ` : X ! G with dim K &lt; 1, every special compatible basic system is solvable. Proof.

Reference-contexts: We employ three such assumptions.
