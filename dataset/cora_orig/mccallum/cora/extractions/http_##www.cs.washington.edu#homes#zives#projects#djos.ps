Title: Distributed Java Object System  
Author: Zack Ives Amit Aggarwal Jonathan Aldrich Miguel Figueroa 
Date: June 10, 1998  
Abstract: The Distributed Java Object System adds advanced naming, persistence, security, mobility, and load balancing features to Java's basic RMI communications package. Security is provided through a combination of capabilities [Dennis and Van Horn 1966] and ACLs [Saltzer 1974] that combines some of the best features of both. Objects are persistently stored through directories that provide a user-readable and location transparent naming system. Through a check pointing system, active objects allow themselves to be moved by a distributed dynamic load balancing system that tries to balance the load on different processors. This migration of objects is transparent to the user. We have written several sample applications that demonstrate the features of our system.
