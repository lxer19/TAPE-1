Abstract: It is well known that, given two simple n-sided polygons, it may not be possible to triangulate the two polygons in a compatible fashion, if one's choice of triangulation vertices is restricted to polygon corners. Is it always possible to produce compatible triangulations if additional vertices inside the polygon are allowed? We give a positive answer and construct a pair of such triangulations with O(n 2 ) new triangulation vertices. Moreover, we show that there exists a "universal" way of triangulating an n-sided polygon with O(n 2 ) extra triangulation vertices. Finally, we also show that creating compatible triangulations requires a quadratic number of extra vertices in the worst case.

Reference-contexts: Thus S 1 and, similarly, S 2 is a triangulation, as claimed. Compatibility follows by construction. Algorithmically the construction can be carried out by first triangulating the given polygons (see, for example, Garey et al. [GJPT] for an O (n log n) algorithm, or Chazelle <ref> [C] </ref> for an O (n) algorithm) and then computing their triangulated overlay by tracing each edge of T 0 1 through T 0 2 in overall time O (n + k) where k is the number of Steiner points introduced in the construction. 3 A Universal Triangulation Observe that our construction

Reference-contexts: The following question was asked by Goodman and Pollack <ref> [G] </ref>: Is it possible to triangulate any two polygons with the same number of vertices compatibly if additional vertices (Steiner points) are allowed in the interior? If yes, how many such points are required? fl Work on this paper was supported by Dimacs (Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science),
