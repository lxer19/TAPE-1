Title: CVODE, A STIFF/NONSTIFF ODE SOLVER IN C  
Author: SCOTT D. COHEN AND ALAN C. HINDMARSH 
Abstract: CVODE is a package written in C for solving initial value problems for ordinary differential equations. It provides the capabilities of two older Fortran packages, VODE and VODPK. CVODE solves both stiff and nonstiff systems, using variable-coefficient Adams and BDF methods. In the stiff case, options for treating the Jacobian of the system include dense and band matrix solvers, and a preconditioned Krylov (iterative) solver. In the highly modular organization of CVODE, the core integrator module is independent of the linear system solvers, and all operations on N -vectors are isolated in a module of vector kernels. A set of parallel extenstions of CVODE, called PVODE, is being developed. CVODE is available from Netlib, and comes with an extensive user guide.

Reference-contexts: The two Fortran solvers that together represent these methods are VODE <ref> [1] </ref> and VODPK [3]. VODE is a general purpose solver that includes methods for stiff and nonstiff systems, and in the stiff case uses only direct methods (full or banded) for the solution of linear systems.

Reference-contexts: combination of a BDF integrator and a preconditioned GMRES algorithm yields a powerful tool for large stiff systems, because it combines established methods for stiff integration, nonlinear iteration, and Krylov (linear) iteration with a problem-specific treatment of the dominant source of stiffness, in the form of the user-supplied preconditioner matrix <ref> [2] </ref>. Most of the algorithmic features of CVODE have their origins in the work of Bill Gear.

Reference-contexts: To use CVODE, a user must provide certain problem-defining routines and make calls to the solver, as in the case of Fortran solvers like VODE. We give here only a summary and a small example. Complete details, including three fully annotated examples, are given in the CVODE User Guide <ref> [4] </ref>. To start with, the user's calling program must make calls to either three or four functions in CVODE.

Reference-contexts: n fi n;0 :(5) For this the choices available in CVODE are: * a direct method with dense treatment of J * a direct method with banded treatment of J * a direct method with approximate diagonal treatment of J * a Krylov method, preconditioned GMRES (Generalized Minimal RESidual method) <ref> [5] </ref>. With scaling and preconditioning included in the GMRES method, we refer to this algorithm as SPGMR: Scaled Preconditioned GMRES.
