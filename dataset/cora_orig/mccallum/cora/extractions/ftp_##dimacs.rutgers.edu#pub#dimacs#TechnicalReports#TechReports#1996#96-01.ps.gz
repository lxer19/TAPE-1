Reference-contexts: Several proof techniques, however, do not rely on specific properties of these domains, and, as a matter of fact, can be applied to wide classes of domains. For instance, several results in Benedict et al. <ref> [2] </ref> and in this paper are formulated and proved for the so-called o-minimal structures|a diverse family of structures that includes many domains normally considered in the database theory, but, on the other hand, does include quite weird structures, whose relevance to the database theory|or, for that matter, whose very existence|may be <p> this part is similar to that in [14], and actually, all the results for ordered divisible Abelian groups that we prove can alternatively be proved by refining the methods from [14]. 1 Although the algorithm is not explicit in their paper. - 4 - 1.5 Non-recursive translation Benedikt et al. <ref> [2] </ref> recently showed that the generic extended, and restricted queries have the same expressive power over every o-minimal domain. 2 Examples of o-minimal structures include, for instance, real numbers with +, fl, and &lt;, as well as many other structures. <p> Since every ordered divisible Abelian group is o-minimal, this, in one sense, covers the results discussed in Subsection 1.4. Notice however, that in another sense, this result is of a different nature. First, the proof in <ref> [2] </ref> is not constructive and does not give an algorithm for translation. Further, this proof cannot be made constructive. This can be argued upon along the following lines. <p> Q.E.D. As a side remark, note that this technique implies the result from <ref> [2] </ref> and [13] about the so-called active semantics. Consider FO formulas over the signature L + . Any quantifier-free formula is called active. Let AD (x) be a formula which says that x is an element from the active domain.

Reference-contexts: Then, 0 P i (~x) is a +-free formula equivalent to (~x). Denote this formula by . Clearly, this can be constructed effectively, which finishes the proof. Q.E.D. 6 Non-recursive equivalence In this section, we use techniques from model theory. The reader is referred to <ref> [3] </ref> for standard definitions and results. Fix a non-principal ultra-filter D over the set ! of all natural numbers. Let V be the ultra-power of U by D.

Reference-contexts: However, the question of whether or not extended queries are more expressive than order queries, has remained open, and as Grumbach and Su <ref> [5] </ref> pointed out, ". . . there is a serious lack of proof techniques. . . " in this area. This very problem can be considered in a general form. Consider a list of relational names. Consider two signatures L 0 = f&lt;g, and L = f&lt;g S .

Reference-contexts: The problem we are interested in is to try to increase the expressive power of FO, while preserving the genericity. There are several ways to increase the expressive power of queries. One of them is to add additional domain functions or relations. For example, in Grumbach et al. <ref> [7, 6] </ref> extended queries over the domain Q of rational numbers together with the relation &lt; of the rational linear order and the usual operation + were considered. <p> Attempts to distinguish the resulting extended queries from order queries in this domain using specific combinatorial or spatial queries not in AC 0 |like parity, Eulerian traversal, or region connectivity|have been unsuccessful, and, finally, <ref> [7, 6] </ref> proved the AC 0 uniform data complexity for the extended queries over finitely representable inputs with integer constants only. <p> Due to our lifting result, the same is automatically true for all finitely representable states. In this paper, we prove a more general result on recursive translation of generic extended into restricted FO queries over every ordered divisible Abelian group, thus answering, for example, the question from <ref> [7, 6] </ref> of the role of addition in databases over rational numbers. Although recursive, our translation is highly inefficient computationally. The size of the pure order formula generated by our algorithm is multi-exponential in the size of the original generic formula with addition.

Reference-contexts: Now, the proof of Lemma 6.7 can be carried out with no changes. Q.E.D. Our proofs of Theorems 6.6 and 6.8 use the Continuum Hypothesis. However, the theo rems are 1 2 Arithmetical statements. By Shoenfield's Absoluteness Theorem (see <ref> [8] </ref>, Theorem 98), they are absolute. Thus, it is possible to construct proofs of our theorems which do not use the Continuum Hypothesis.

Reference-contexts: There are some rather simple generic queries, however, that are not expressible. For example, a Boolean query that says that the cardinality of a set|a unary relation|is odd, is not expressible in FO. More examples can be found in <ref> [10, 11, 9] </ref>. The problem we are interested in is to try to increase the expressive power of FO, while preserving the genericity. There are several ways to increase the expressive power of queries. One of them is to add additional domain functions or relations.

Reference-contexts: This makes the traditional relational model not closed, in the sense that the output data of queries are of a different nature than input. [1, 4] observed, however, that these output relations are particularly simple, for simple domains (say, for ordered natural numbers or such). Kanel-lakis et al. <ref> [10, 11] </ref> concentrated on ordered domains of real, and rational numbers, and observed that, since first order theories of these admit elimination of quantifiers, the answers to first order queries can be represented as quantifier-free first order formulas, and then, if we allow database relations to be arbitrary relations representable by <p> Such relations are called finitely representable (f.r.) These finitely representable databases are a logical choice, because finitely representable relations appear as results of queries dealing with finite relations anyway, and it is also a natural choice in many applications, say, in geographical databases (cf. <ref> [10, 11] </ref>). 1.3 Ordered domains and generic queries For example, consider ordered rational numbers. A query, then, is a mapping that maps every finitely representable database state into a new finitely representable relation. <p> There are some rather simple generic queries, however, that are not expressible. For example, a Boolean query that says that the cardinality of a set|a unary relation|is odd, is not expressible in FO. More examples can be found in <ref> [10, 11, 9] </ref>. The problem we are interested in is to try to increase the expressive power of FO, while preserving the genericity. There are several ways to increase the expressive power of queries. One of them is to add additional domain functions or relations. <p> Thus, a d.b. state essentially defines a structure of a larger signature with U as the domain; then a formula with n free variables defines an n-ary relation over U . Generally, an FO query may yield an infinite answer even in a finite d.b. state. <ref> [10] </ref> introduced the notion of finitely representable database state as a database state where every relation corresponding to a relation name from SC is defined (independently on the others) by a quantifier-free formula using =; &lt;, and constants for the elements of U . We consider two languages for querying.

Reference-contexts: Recursivity is preserved as well. This technique can also be used to expand applicability of several other results for finite database states to the case of finitely representable states. 1.4 Recursive translation Paradaens et al. <ref> [14] </ref> recently considered real numbers with +, and showed that, over finite database states, generic extended queries can be recursively 1 translated into restricted (pure order) queries. Due to our lifting result, the same is automatically true for all finitely representable states. <p> Notice also, the set of generic extended queries is undecidable. Our translation algorithm assumes genericity, and, if applied to a non-generic query, gives a non-equivalent formula of the restricted language. These issues are explored in Section 5. The technique in this part is similar to that in <ref> [14] </ref>, and actually, all the results for ordered divisible Abelian groups that we prove can alternatively be proved by refining the methods from [14]. 1 Although the algorithm is not explicit in their paper. - 4 - 1.5 Non-recursive translation Benedikt et al.
