Reference-contexts: This process involves assigning lengths to the edges, and placement of the bends. This graph drawing process is a problem in and of itself, however Tamassia and Tollis point out that various algorithms already exist for this purpose [6] <ref> [1] </ref>. Based on this existing work, the following lemma is presented: Lemma: Let H be an orthogonal representation with bend-cost b for an n-vertex planar graph G.

Reference-contexts: A vertex-segment (t) is called a sink if all its incident edge-segments are below (t). Figure 2 shows a sample visibility representation. Tamassia and Tollis rely on some previous work on visibility representations by themselves [5] and independently by Roosenstiehl & Tarjan <ref> [2] </ref>, to 6 build visibility representations with certain properties. In Tamassia's paper on this subject, he proposes a method of building visibility representations by getting an st-numbering, that is a topological ordering, of the vertices, and using this as a base for laying out the heights of the vertex-segments.

Reference-contexts: In the following, the total number of bends that are present along an edge will be called bend-cost. In a separate paper <ref> [3] </ref>, Tamassia gives an algorithm to construct a grid embedding with the minimum bend cost. Given a graph, with n nodes this algorithm guarantees to find a grid embedding with the minimum bend-cost possible for that graph.
