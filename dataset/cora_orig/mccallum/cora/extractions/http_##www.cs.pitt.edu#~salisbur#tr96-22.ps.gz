Abstract: High speed switching networks have many applications in computer systems, including massively parallel processors, distributed multicomputers, networking and processor to disk interconnections. These applications all require high bandwidth, low latency communication paths. Although optical networks can meet these performance requirements, current circuit switching and packet switching techniques are not quite suitable for controlling such networks. Time division multiplexing (TDM) schemes can improve the performance of optical interconnection networks by taking advantage of the locality of references present in the communication patterns. In this paper, we construct a model to quantify the cost of compiled communications in multiplexed networks. We show how the cost is affected by the characteristics of the network and how to choose the most appropriate multiplexing degree based on these characteristics. To show how the cost is affected by the characteristics of a parallel application, we formally quantify the intuitive concept of locality of reference in communication patterns. We then relate locality to the communication costs in multiplexed networks.

Reference-contexts: Locality of reference in both memory and file accesses can be exploited by caching to improve processor and I/O performance. The caching strategy can be extended to the communications arena by the caching of network addresses and circuit requirements <ref> [1, 8, 9, 17] </ref>. The locality concept can be extended to interprocessor communications by drawing an analogy between the set of paths used by communicating processors and the set of pages of memory used by a program [3].

Reference-contexts: TDM requires the use of a global clock to synchronize the time slots for all the transmitters and receivers connected to the network. The actual data transmission, however, does not require a global clock as self-clocking can be used at the bit level <ref> [2] </ref>. In parallel processing systems, the time required to communicate between processors is a significant factor affecting the performance of an application or algorithm. In a circuit-switched network, much of the communication delay arises from the network management overhead to provide the required paths. <p> Both determining and changing the network state are potential sources of communication delay. Techniques that determine the application's communication pattern and the required network states prior to program execution are called compiled communication, or static techniques <ref> [2, 12] </ref>. Techniques that use information gathered at program execution time to determine which paths the program needs are called dynamic techniques. The concepts of locality of reference and working set are well known in the context of a program's access to memory.

Reference-contexts: Multiplexing is a general technique that can be used to share resources in any network. However, it is the large bandwidth of optical networks that makes multiplexing especially attractive as a means of increasing network performance <ref> [3, 15] </ref>. An interconnection network built from optical components can provide communication bandwidth that exceeds the requirements of any single processor. In time division multiplexing (TDM), the optical bandwidth is shared via a sequence of sets of interconnections. <p> The locality concept can be extended to interprocessor communications by drawing an analogy between the set of paths used by communicating processors and the set of pages of memory used by a program <ref> [3] </ref>. The set of all paths required by an application corresponds to a virtual memory and the set of paths currently in use corresponds to the pages of virtual memory that are resident in physical storage.

Reference-contexts: This alternative is attractive for optical networks since it can provide all-optical paths from sources to destinations and thus can fully exploit the high bandwidth of optics <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: When there are n nodes and each node is connected to every other node, there are O (n 2 ) total connections. When n is very large, it becomes impractical to provide this many physical connections. The following two alternatives have been explored to improve network scalability <ref> [10] </ref>: * The reduction of direct connectivity. With packet switching, messages are sent to their final destination via intermediate nodes. The intermediate nodes may either be switches or other processors. These nodes use routing information added to each message to pass the message on to its destination. <p> In the discussion that follows, we will assume that the network can provide any arbitrary set of m paths simultaneously. For example, networks such as the Benes, Clos, cross-bar, and WDM star can provide connections for any arbitrary permutation <ref> [6, 10] </ref>.
