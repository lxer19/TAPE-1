Reference-contexts: Perhaps the same could be done for term consistency checking when the text to be validated clearly belongs to a well-defined domain for which a reliable term glossary already exists. Another interesting possibility has recently been raised in <ref> (Dagan and Church 1994) </ref>. Their Termight system extracts candidate terms in a source text (like our F-TERM), and then goes on to automatically identify a likely target equivalent in the translation, based on a word alignment program that they have developed.
