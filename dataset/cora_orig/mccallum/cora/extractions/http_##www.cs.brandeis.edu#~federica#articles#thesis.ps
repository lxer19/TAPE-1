Allen, 1984) </ref>, and the nature of computational dictionaries (Wilks 1975, 1978). In particular, Wilks' work has greatly influenced the view of current computational lexicons by pointing out the inadequacy of traditional lexicography to properly account for the inescapable problem of word sense.

Reference-contexts: Chom-sky's solution was to abandon the hope of finding systematic relations between verbs and derived nominals, and to introduce a set of features in the lexicon. If Chomsky's view is still very influential and has set the groundwork for the subsequent development of notions such as blocking and suppletion <ref> (Aronoff, 1980) </ref>, Lees' view is no less present 9 in current approaches where morphology plays a prominent role. More specifically, the starting point of a number of important analysis (cf.

Reference-contexts: These are discussed in separate sections below. The view that lexical items carry crucial information expressing analytic knowledge of the semantic content of a given word is generally a very controversial one <ref> (cf. Austin, 1962, Quine, 1960) </ref>. In GL, it is argued that, from the point of view of a linguistic theory, the assignment of this type of information is based on the extent that meaning components affect grammatical behavior.

Reference-contexts: These properties of activities are rather well known in the literature on event semantics <ref> (cf. Bach, 1981, Mourelatos, 1978, 1981) </ref>. The second is that in describing the relation between the syntax and the semantics of these derived nominal forms, we can imagine that they involve different derivations corresponding to potentially distinct levels of representation (cf. Williams, 1973).

Reference-contexts: This class of nouns denote individuals for which the defining event is the state resulting from the occurrence of an event ff. Examples of this class include widow, and fugitive, as well as the set of morphologically derived -ee-nominals <ref> (cf. Barker, 1995) </ref>. The nominals fugitive and escapee, for instance, refer to an individual for which the stage-level property of not being captive results from an act of escaping. Consider, for instance, the sentences in (87) below: (87) a.

Reference-contexts: Without detailing the behavior of adjectives <ref> (cf. Bouillon, 1996, forthcoming) </ref>, the examples in (14) further support the utility of providing lexical items with internal structure. In this section, I have motivated two fundamental assumptions of the forthcoming analysis: 1. All agentive nominals have an event position, be they stage-level or individual-level; 73 2.

Reference-contexts: Additional observations, however, have been made in the context of other linguistic phenomena which turned out to have a bearing on a possible analysis of agentive nouns.

Reference-contexts: The language for lexical representation is largely the language of typed-feature structures <ref> (cf. Carpenter, 1992) </ref>, as developed in Copestake (1995), which is an extension of earlier work in unification based theories (cf. Shieber, 1986, Pollard and Sag, 1987). Typed-feature structures are hierarchically structured via partial ordering on types, which impose appropriateness conditions on the subtypes.

Reference-contexts: This is the topic of the sections below. 4.4 Unaccusative Stage-Level Nominals The subset of SLNs which I call Unaccusative-SLNs display a behavior which is parallel to that of unaccusative verbs. As mentioned in Chapter 2, in GL, the class of unaccusative verbs encode an underlying causative relation <ref> (cf. also Chierchia, 1989) </ref>, where the final state is headed (cf. Pustejovsky, 1995). I will argue that the properties associated with the set of Unaccusative-SLNs can be explained in terms of the right-headedness of the defining event.

Reference-contexts: Additional observations, however, have been made in the context of other linguistic phenomena which turned out to have a bearing on a possible analysis of agentive nouns. These areas include: genericity (Krifka et al., 1995), morphology (Moortgat, 1987), stage-level predication (Carlson, 1977, 1982), individual-level predication <ref> (Chierchia, 1995, Kratzer, 1995) </ref>, argument structure (Grimshaw, 1990, Rappaport and Levin, 1992), and compounding (Lees, 1960, Levi, 1978, Finin, 1980). <p> In particular, I show that an event-based analysis of ILNs is more likely to capture the seemingly generic nature of these nominals <ref> (cf. Krifka et. al, 1995, Chierchia, 1995) </ref>. As argued in Section 3.4, the individual-level properties of this class of nouns are the result of the interpretation of a state predicate which introduces modal/generic force (i.e. ability, habit, obligation, etc.) on the event that characterizes an individual. <p> Pustejovsky, 1995) appears to be consistent with the view that individual-level predicates are inherently generic <ref> (cf. Chierchia, 1995) </ref>. In particular, Chierchia argues that individual-level predicates have a Davidsonian event variable in their representation, which is bound by a built-in generic operator similar in some ways to quantificational adverbs such as always. <p> Alternatively, it can be viewed as restricting a contextual variable <ref> (cf. Chierchia, 1995) </ref> to all those situations in which someone uses the knife. This discussion is meant to show that the formal similarity between ILNs and instruments is is the result of the characterizing event being encoded in the telic role in both cases.

Reference-contexts: Since Lees' (1960) work on nominalizations, the more substantial studies on this data set (Fabb, 1984, Sproat, 1985), have treated the semantic properties of agentive nominals as an epiphenomenon of principles relating to Theta Theory <ref> (Chomsky, 1981) </ref>. Additional observations, however, have been made in the context of other linguistic phenomena which turned out to have a bearing on a possible analysis of agentive nouns. <p> for capturing the semantics of SLNs is tightly connected with a number of grammatical facts concerning binding phenomena. 4.2.2 Binding Properties of Predicatively-Dependent Expressions In this section I will discuss a set of data which show that the predicative dependence of SLNs can be viewed in terms of binding theory <ref> (Chomsky, 1981) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Weinreich, 1960). Thus, the requirement and the purpose of a computational lexicon sustaining NLP differs in the same way in which prescriptive grammars are distinct from generative grammars, namely grammatical system describing the underlying structures that are responsible for the knowledge of language <ref> (cf. Chomsky, 1965) </ref>. In the sections that follow, I will argue that a generative lexical model can provide a linguistic knowledge base that has the potential to greatly contribute towards developing linguistically motivated and sound treatments of specific problems in NLP.

Reference-contexts: The development of the GL lexicon is based on two essential elements: typed inheritance, (cf. Pustejovsky and Boguraev, 1993) and type unification, <ref> (cf. Copestake, 1992) </ref>. The view of inheritance also held in GL theory extends the conventional inheritance mechanisms by taking into account the role of qualia structure. Consider the nom-inals novel and dictionary, which both inherit information from book.

Reference-contexts: The observation that language displays systematic patterns of polysemous behavior, which is manifested as complementary ambiguity (cf. Weinreich, 1964), grammatical alternations (Levin, 1993), logical polysemy (Pustejovsky, 1995), among other phenomena, has largely contributed towards new lexical architectures (Pustejovsky, 1995), as well as formal representation languages for lexical structures <ref> (Copestake et al. 1993, Sanfilippo, 1993) </ref>. Taking more seriously the contribution of research in lexical semantics, the alternative 4 model that emerges views the lexicon as a knowledge-base with considerable expressive power (Pustejovsky, 1991, 1995, Pustejovsky and Boguraev, 1993, Anick and Bergler, 1991, Copestake and Briscoe, 1991, Vossen, 1995).

Reference-contexts: A number of researchers in computational linguistics have been focusing on hierarchical architectures since they avoid redundancies, they may contribute to more efficient processing, and they allow for the development of large and complex systems of semantic relations <ref> (cf. Daelemans, et al. 1992, Van der Linden, 1992) </ref>. The lexicon under development within the Core Lexical Engine Project at Brandeis 195 University is based on this view.

Reference-contexts: I argue that this is insufficient evidence to say that instruments are lexical idioms, since the problems noticed by Sproat seem to derived from the inadequacy of theta-roles <ref> (cf. Dowty, 1991) </ref> to fully capture fine-grained semantic distinctions between argument types. In Rappaport and Levin (1992), the behavior of instruments appears heterogeneous. Given that they distinguish between event and non-event nominals according to whether or not the nominalized form licenses a complement, they identify two types of instruments.

Additional observations, however, have been made in the context of other linguistic phenomena which turned out to have a bearing on a possible analysis of agentive nouns. <p> Focusing on the role of productive morphology, the generalization that is usually adopted is that the morpheme -er applies to an external argument which is interpreted as the agent of an event, irrespectively of whether the type of that argument is human or physical object. Recent analyses <ref> (Fabb, 1984, Sproat, 1985, Rappaport and Levin, 1992) </ref> have suggested a variety of solutions for the treatment of instruments relative to the set of agentive -er-nominals.

Reference-contexts: These areas include: genericity (Krifka et al., 1995), morphology (Moortgat, 1987), stage-level predication (Carlson, 1977, 1982), individual-level predication (Chierchia, 1995, Kratzer, 1995), argument structure <ref> (Grimshaw, 1990, Rappaport and Levin, 1992) </ref>, and compounding (Lees, 1960, Levi, 1978, Finin, 1980). <p> In fact, lexical items are provided with inter-nal structure in a variety of different frameworks. A representation such as argument structure can certainly be viewed as the minimal lexical semantic specification of a word <ref> (cf. Grimshaw, 1990, Rappaport and Levin, 1992, Levin and Rappaport, 1995) </ref>. A similar position is elaborated in Hale and Keyser (1993) who view the argument structure of verbal predicators as involving a complex syntactic representation. <p> Clearly, the two senses of builder are logically related in much the same way as the process versus result distinction with event nominals <ref> (cf. Grimshaw, 1990, Rappaport and Levin, 1992, Pustejovsky, 1995) </ref>. Consider, in fact, the event nominal building below: (8) a. The building of this house took many years. (process) b. <p> In relation to nominals such as builder, Rappaport and Levin (1992) observe that they display an alternation which is parallel to the process/result distinction with event nom-inalizations <ref> (cf. Grimshaw, 1990) </ref>, where the presence or the absence of the complement contributes towards disambiguating the two readings. As mentioned in Chapter 1, Rap-paport and Levin distinguish two classes of agentive nouns in terms of an event position in the parameter list of the nominal.

Reference-contexts: Although argument structure makes reference to semantic labels such as actor, patient, source, theme, and so on, <ref> (Gruber, 1965, Fillmore, 1968) </ref> it is still greatly inadequate to account for the semantics of agentive nouns.

Reference-contexts: The question is whether, within the nominal domain, complements are expressed under a different set of constraints from those of the verbal forms. As discussed in the literature on event semantics <ref> (Hinrichs, 1985, Krifka, 1992, Verkuyl, 1993) </ref> an argument may affect the aspectual interpretation of the whole VP structure. Consider, for instance, the examples mentioned by Krifka (1992): (64) a. John ran for an hour/*in an hour. b. John ran a mile *for an hour/in an hour. (65) a.

Reference-contexts: These researchers are moving away from the use of the lexicon as a plug-in module providing linguistic information on demand, and have argued against an unstructured and unbounded enumeration of lexical entries, where the disambiguation process is simply based on matching lexical features <ref> (Hirst, 1987) </ref>. As a result, the role of the lexicon has become increasingly more prominent in the treatment of natural language, since it provides crucial grammatical and semantic information exploited by the grammar in the course of parsing and generation.

Reference-contexts: To this end, a system needs a basis for distinguishing the different profiles of the agentive nominals appearing in the text, e.g. rebels versus army <ref> (cf. Hobbs, 1991) </ref>, as well as, relative to those profiles which nominals are relevant for reporting the required information, e.g., rebels, insurgents, government soldiers, and which nouns are not, e.g., journalists, press reports. The relation between events and participants is in turn given by the properties of those events. <p> Nirenburg, 1987, Dorr, 1995); 194 * information extraction requires profiling the individuals involved in events for pur-poses of making the right inferences about events that should be reported and events that can be ignored <ref> (cf. Hobbs. 1991) </ref>; * the availability of rich semantic information allows us to go a long way in understanding ellipsed information in a text without appealing to large amounts of handcoded domain-dependent knowledge (cf.

Reference-contexts: This shift of perspective, which characterizes a hybrid approach such as the GL model, combines the interests of a number of different disciplines, namely artificial intelligence, formal linguistics and lexicography. Artificial intelligence provides the techniques for grounding reasoning within a knowledge base <ref> (Hobbs et al., 1993) </ref>. Formal linguistics allows us to determine and refine the contents of the knowledge base by accounting for the formal properties of language. Finally, the availability of machine readable dictionaries and large corpora provide the tool for automatically constructing the knowledge base. <p> If a type mismatch occurs, then the search for the ellipsed information can be restricted to the space which has grown out of annotating the initial set. As mentioned above, this procedure can be viewed similarly to abduction <ref> (cf. Hobbs et al., 1993) </ref>, where knowledge base contains axioms which corresponds to "micro-theories" of the world, or more likely of a particular domain, that a computational agent uses in reasoning for proving the truth conditions of a text.

Reference-contexts: Part of the motivation for providing this type of structured lexical representation was, 193 in fact, largely driven by computational concerns <ref> (cf.

Reference-contexts: Current theories of the lexicon, which represent the combined wisdom of theoretical work <ref> (Jackendoff, 1972, 1983, Gruber, 1965, Miller and Johnson-Laird, 1976, Dowty, 1979) </ref> and computational work (Wilks, 1975, 1978), have developed to respond to the challenges in the treatment of natural language.

Reference-contexts: The view taken in GL is closely related to models that view lexical representation as a rich system of semantic relations, such as that outlined in Moravcsik (1990), as well as Jackendoff's Conceptual structure <ref> (cf. Jackendoff, 1990) </ref>. These systems, however, differ in a number of theoretical assumptions. In particular, in GL lexical items are taken to involve more than one level of representation, namely argument structure, event structure, and qualia structure. These are discussed in separate sections below.

Reference-contexts: In Italian, the strategy for forming compounds is different, in that the two senses of the English Noun-Noun compound plastic knife are associated with different prepositions <ref> (cf. Busa and Johnston, 1995) </ref>: (3) (a.) plastic knife coltello da plastica sense 1 = purpose (b.) plastic knife coltello di plastica sense 2 = made-of The choice of preposition in Italian appears to be fairly systematically associated with different qualia roles.

Reference-contexts: This treatment, which exploits the compositional properties of the individual lexical items is more desirable than lexical rules, which require exhaustively handcoding all the possible relations that could possibly hold between members of a compound <ref> (cf. Jones, 1995) </ref>. Given that compounding is very productive strategy for extending the expressive possibilities of a nominal form, the lexical rule approach does not provide a solid linguistic generalization.

Reference-contexts: In general this event structure corresponds to causative verbs such as break, die, and so on. The relation ffi / <ref> (cf. Kamp, 1979) </ref>, in (24), corresponds to event descriptions including two simultaneous subevents, such as accompany or marry.

Reference-contexts: Given that the two events run and discover are of different types, then obviously the related nominals should be interpreted differently. If lexical choice is driven by the semantic content that a lexical item carries <ref> (McDonald, 1991, Wanner, 1994) </ref>, then the type of the event which defines an individual should allow us to make the right prediction. <p> Thus chosing a given lexical item is crucial for packaging the information which is best suited for communicating a given meaning. A number of approaches to generation have argued in favor of a strong lexi-calist position where lexical choice determines grammatical realization <ref> (cf. McDonald, 1991, Wanner, 1994) </ref>. The argument against the predictability of the meaning of certain nominalized forms bears directly on issues of lexical choice. In particular, while a runner is someone who "runs" a skipper is not someone who "skips", rather a person who works on a sail boat (cf.

Reference-contexts: Sproat's solution is to treat all -er nominals referring to instruments as "lexical idioms", which is again a lexicalist position. These issues have an important bearing for lexical choice in natural language generation. The general problem has been stated as follows <ref> (cf. Meteer, 1992) </ref>: if a runner is an individual who generally run, a discoverer is not an individual who generally discovers, but one who has discovered something. Similarly, the morpheme -ista (-ist), in Italian, which also derives agentive nouns, produces idiosyncratic results. <p> McDonald, 1991, Wanner, 1994). The argument against the predictability of the meaning of certain nominalized forms bears directly on issues of lexical choice. In particular, while a runner is someone who "runs" a skipper is not someone who "skips", rather a person who works on a sail boat <ref> (cf. Meteer, 1992) </ref>. Note, however, that nothing should rule out a productive sense of skipper as person who skips, given that it is certainly found in children's talk.

In other words, the telic role imposes a particular interpretation to the relation that it encodes.

Reference-contexts: While lexical resources are crucial for the choice of a word in terms of the information that it conveys, compositional mechanisms should also have a prominent role.

Such mechanism is called projective inheritance <ref> (for details see, Pustejovsky, 1991, and Pustejovsky and Boguraev, 1993) </ref>, and it operates on the qualia structure of a lexical item to produce a structured representation of semantic relations which share the same conceptual space.

Pustejovsky and Boguraev, 1993) </ref>. One of the crucial arguments that I have tried to develop is that to understand complex expressions involving nominal forms we don't have to look beyond the linguistic resources that are made available by the lexical items in a sentence. <p> The development of the GL lexicon is based on two essential elements: typed inheritance, <ref> (cf. Pustejovsky and Boguraev, 1993) </ref> and type unification, (cf. Copestake, 1992). The view of inheritance also held in GL theory extends the conventional inheritance mechanisms by taking into account the role of qualia structure. Consider the nom-inals novel and dictionary, which both inherit information from book. <p> John bought a new dictionary. (13) a. John began the novel last night. 196 b. !John began the dictionary last night. The oddness of (13b), under the reading of "begin to consult the dictionary" is due to the unavailability of an appropriate type in the semantics of dictionary, <ref> (cf. Pustejovsky and Boguraev, 1993, Pustejovsky, 1995) </ref>. This problem can be solved by typing the inheritance of lexical information relative to different qualia roles. The lexical items dictionary and novel inherit from book via their formal role, and they are distinguished by inheriting different information via their other roles.

Reference-contexts: The observation that language displays systematic patterns of polysemous behavior, which is manifested as complementary ambiguity <ref> (cf. Weinreich, 1964) </ref>, grammatical alternations (Levin, 1993), logical polysemy (Pustejovsky, 1995), among other phenomena, has largely contributed towards new lexical architectures (Pustejovsky, 1995), as well as formal representation languages for lexical structures (Copestake et al. 1993, Sanfilippo, 1993).

Reference-contexts: Current theories of the lexicon, which represent the combined wisdom of theoretical work (Jackendoff, 1972, 1983, Gruber, 1965, Miller and Johnson-Laird, 1976, Dowty, 1979) and computational work <ref> (Wilks, 1975, 1978) </ref>, have developed to respond to the challenges in the treatment of natural language. <p> Semantic issues become prominent, as illustrated in the development of story understanding systems (cf. Alterman, 1985), planning and the modeling of action, (cf. Allen, 1984), and the nature of computational dictionaries <ref> (Wilks 1975, 1978) </ref>. In particular, Wilks' work has greatly influenced the view of current computational lexicons by pointing out the inadequacy of traditional lexicography to properly account for the inescapable problem of word sense.

Reference-contexts: Bach, 1981, Mourelatos, 1978, 1981). The second is that in describing the relation between the syntax and the semantics of these derived nominal forms, we can imagine that they involve different derivations corresponding to potentially distinct levels of representation <ref> (cf. Williams, 1973) </ref>. The nominals violinista (violinist), and camionista (truck-driver), are related to the nouns violin, and truck, respectively.
