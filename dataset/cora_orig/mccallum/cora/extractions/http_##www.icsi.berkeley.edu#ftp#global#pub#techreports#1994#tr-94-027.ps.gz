Abstract: We describe our method how to implement C-program sequences in torrent (T0) assembler code while there is no efficient automatic tool. We use re-structuring of the source code, vectorization, dataflow graphs, a simple scheduling strategy and a straight forward register allocation algorithm. We define some lower and an upper bound for the expected run time. For two functions, namely the color transformation and reverse DCT, we achieve almost 54, respectively 16 times the performance of a Sparc 2 workstation.

Reference-contexts: All run times in ms, we give in the following, are based on a 40 MHz version of T0. 9 MPEG-Decoder We took the program code for MPEG-decoding available via anonymous ftp from UCB at site: toe.cs.berkeley.edu ([Le 91], <ref> [PSR93] </ref>). Profiling the decoding part on one test film gives the run time of the different functions.
