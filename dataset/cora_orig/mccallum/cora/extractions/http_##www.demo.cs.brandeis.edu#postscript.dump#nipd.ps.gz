Abstract: The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game has been used extensively in the study of the evolution of cooperative behaviours in social and biological systems. There have been a lot of experimental studies on evolving strategies for 2-player Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma games (2IPD). However, there are many real world problems, especially many social and economic ones, which cannot be modelled by the 2IPD. The n-player Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (NIPD) is a more realistic and general game which can model those problems. This paper presents two sets of experiments on evolving strategies for the NIPD. The first set of experiments examine the impact of the number of players in the NIPD on the evolution of cooperation in the group. Our experiments show that cooperation is less likely to emerge in a large group than in a small group. The second set of experiments study the generalisation ability of evolved strategies from the point of view of machine learning. Our experiments reveal the effect of changing the evolutionary environment of evolution on the generalisation ability of evolved strategies.

Reference-contexts: Introduction The 2-player Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game (2IPD) is a 2 fi 2 non-zerosum noncooperative game, where "non-zerosum" indicates that the benefits obtained by a player are not necessarily the same as the penalties received by another player and "noncooperative" indicates that no preplay communication is permitted between the players <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. It has been widely studied in such diverse fields as economics, mathematical game theory, political science, and artificial intelligence. In the Prisoner's Dilemma, each player has a choice of two operations: either cooperate with the other player, or defect.

The second set of experiments in this paper deals with an important issue in co-evolutionary learning | the generalisation issue.

We will use two different representations, both of which are look-up tables that give an action for every possible contingency. One way of representing strategies for the NIPD is to generalise the representation scheme used by Axelrod <ref> [7] </ref>. In this scheme, each genotype is a lookup table that covers every possible history of the last few steps. <p> For genetic algorithms, both Hillis [13] and Axelrod <ref> [7] </ref> have attempted co-evolution, where a GA population is evaluated by how well it performs against itself or another GA population, starting from a random population.

Axelrod [7] used genetic algorithms to evolve a population of strategies where each strategy plays the 2IPD with every other strategy in the population. <p> All the strategies in the population are co-evolving in their dy-namic environments. Axelrod found that such dynamic environments produced strategies that performed very well against their population. Fogel <ref> [11] </ref> described similar experiments, but used finite state machines to represent strategies and evolutionary programming to evolve them. However, very few experimental studies have been carried out on the NIPD in spite of its importance and its qualitative difference from the 2IPD.
