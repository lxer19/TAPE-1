Reference-contexts: This knowledge also develops: motion comes first, then textural information, and finally gestalt properties (Spelke et al., 1993). Four-month-old infants expect objects to retain characteristics such as size and trajectory even though they are not visible <ref> (Baillargeon, 1991) </ref>. Infants also seem to be able to categorize spatial relations. Three- to 4-month-old babies categorize left-right (Behl-Chadha and Eimas, 1995) and on-under (Quinn, 1994) relations, generalizing over 9 the orientation, the size, and the absolute location of the objects involved in the relation.

Reference-contexts: Young infants also know about the impenetrability of objects and the parts of objects that should still be visible given the shape of the occluder <ref> (Baillargeon, 1992) </ref>. Other results show that this knowledge develops. For example, very young babies are not surprised by seemingly unsupported stable objects if there is an occlusion event between the habituation and the test (Spelke et al., 1992).

Reference-contexts: Babies as young as 4.5 months realize that objects which are not supported will fall (Needham and Baillargeon, 1993) and 8.5-month-old infants can judge whether an object is being sufficiently supported and be surprised when an insufficiently supported object fails to fall <ref> (Baillargeon and Hanko-Summers, 1990) </ref>. Young infants also know about the impenetrability of objects and the parts of objects that should still be visible given the shape of the occluder (Baillargeon, 1992). Other results show that this knowledge develops.

Reference-contexts: In particular where a language does not encode one of the universal categories in a direct way, we would expect over-generalization errors in which a particular form is applied to the universal category. Work by Bowerman and colleagues <ref> (Choi and Bowerman, 1992) </ref> on the acquisition of English and other languages has shown that this is not the case. Korean children, for example, use no global semantic categories of containment and surface contact/support, categories which are not expressed in Korean in a transparent way.

Reference-contexts: Particular meanings/concepts may be learned in three ways: through nonlinguistic perceptual and motoric experience, through a combination of non-linguistic and linguistic experience, and through linguistic input alone. This type of model allows linguistic categories to influence concepts; that is, various forms of linguistic relativism <ref> (Gumperz and Levinson, 1996) </ref> are possible. Finally such a model predicts that the developmental course of the learning of meaning should depend on the categories inherent in the language being learned. A schematic of this sort of model is shown in Figure 3.

Reference-contexts: The overall architecture we envision is shown in Figure 7. input, linguistic input, and action. Portions we focus on are highlighted in boldface or with thick lines. The visual component of Playpen is based loosely on Kosslyn's model of vision and imagery <ref> (Kosslyn, 1994) </ref>. Figure 8 shows how vision and language interact in the model. The overall organization of the network is such that higher layers roughly preserve the spatial relations within lower layers; higher representations are more abstract than lower ones. The input visual layers, the Visual Buffer, are topological maps.

Reference-contexts: Even a cursory examination of the spatial relation expressions in a subset of languages reveals that the space of possible relations is sliced up in a variety of ways. Consider some of the possibilities for encoding relations of contact, support, and containment between two objects <ref> (Landau, 1996) </ref>. Four possible arrangements of a trajector (black) and landmark (brown) are shown Figure 5. Spanish uses a single word, en, for all of them. <p> For example, when shown a block on a box while being told "the block is acorp the box" people interpret acorp to mean on. In contrast, when shown a stick on a box, people interpret acorp as across <ref> (Landau, 1996) </ref>. In the first case, the shape of the trajector is ignored; in the second it matters. We suggest that something like this goes on throughout the acquisition of language.

Reference-contexts: There seem to be both universal and language-specific aspects to the way this happens. All languages apparently make a fundamental distinction between nouns on the one hand and several classes of words on the other, most centrally, verbs. It has been argued <ref> (Langacker, 1987b) </ref>, though not uncontroversially, that this distinction corresponds to a fundamental conceptual distinction between objects and relations.

Reference-contexts: If a language explicitly codes for a certain distinction, making such a distinction might become relatively easy for speakers of that language. There has been relatively little systematic investigation of relativism (Lucy, 1996), so, despite some intriguing evidence in favor of an influence of language on perception and thought <ref> (Lucy, 1992) </ref>, it is still premature to assume that such an influence is pervasive. Our position is that computational modeling may shed light on the possibility of the language-to-perception/thought relationship in a way that has not been possible before.

Reference-contexts: As we have seen in Section 3.1.1, different languages "slice up" the world in different ways. If a language explicitly codes for a certain distinction, making such a distinction might become relatively easy for speakers of that language. There has been relatively little systematic investigation of relativism <ref> (Lucy, 1996) </ref>, so, despite some intriguing evidence in favor of an influence of language on perception and thought (Lucy, 1992), it is still premature to assume that such an influence is pervasive.

Reference-contexts: For example, babies know about how objects behave in support or occlusion events.

Reference-contexts: Babies also have the more abstract notion of "objectness".

Reference-contexts: Seven-month--old infants are able to generalize over different kinds of objects involved in the relation. Again, this knowledge develops; younger infants are not able to abstract over different objects involved in the relation, while older infants can <ref> (Quinn et al., 1996) </ref>. In sum, before they have learned any words, children seem to be forming categories that are useful in representing what the world is like.

A deeper relationship between language and thought emerges when we examine the influence of the specific language on how the world is perceived. One possibility is that a language may tie its speakers to particular contexts.

Reference-contexts: In order to categorize relations, children must be able to segregate the scene into distinct objects. However, before seven months, they are generally unable to segregate static configurations of objects <ref> (Spelke, 1990) </ref>, and Thelen and Smith (1994) have proposed that they may learn to use static properties to perform object segregation by observing objects move and then come to rest in space. If we are to deal with movement, we must first have a means of dealing with time.

Reference-contexts: Other results show that this knowledge develops.

Reference-contexts: Some evidence for this relationship comes from research showing that there is a correlation between conceptual development and linguistic development in semantic domains such as space and time <ref> (Weist et al., 1997) </ref>. While correlations do not establish a causal relationship in one direction or the other, the most plausible explanation for these results seems to be one in which language acquisition presupposes conceptual categories, the sorts of categories that arise out of perceptual learning.
