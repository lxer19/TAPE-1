Reference-contexts: For general background information about iterative methods and precondi-tioners, see the `Templates' book [2], and books by Axelsson <ref> [1] </ref>, Hackbusch [7], and Saad [10]. More specifically for domain decomposition methods and Schwarz methods, see, e.g., [4, 11]. 1.2 Parallel preconditioners in ParPre The ParPre package contains preconditioners that are specifically designed for execution on parallel computers.

Reference-contexts: In general, a more accurate choice of C will yield a more speedy solution of the iterative process, but such a choice will also be more costly to construct and to apply. For general background information about iterative methods and precondi-tioners, see the `Templates' book <ref> [2] </ref>, and books by Axelsson [1], Hackbusch [7], and Saad [10]. More specifically for domain decomposition methods and Schwarz methods, see, e.g., [4, 11]. 1.2 Parallel preconditioners in ParPre The ParPre package contains preconditioners that are specifically designed for execution on parallel computers.

Reference-contexts: The design philosophy and mathematical background are covered in detail in a companion paper <ref> [3] </ref>. 1.3.2 MPI and Petsc The ParPre library uses MPI for the message passing protocol, and Petsc for intermediate level primitives for distributed matrix manipulation. These packages have to be installed before you can use ParPre.

For this, we have taken two approaches in the design of the package: 1. Certain preconditioners are based on subdomain partitioning of the physical problem.

Reference-contexts: See the Petsc manual for more information about setting options. 26 B Relationship to Petsc The ParPre library uses Petsc routines for basic matrix and vector manipulation. Thus you need to have the Petsc library <ref> [5, 6] </ref> installed. B.1 Petsc installation Some of the Petsc routines have been changed for use in ParPre. If you use Petsc as an independent package, you need not be aware of this, since the changes affect internal routines. No calling sequences of user routines were changed.

Reference-contexts: This gives an ILU (0)-type factori sation. AMLFillStrong allow large fill-in elements. This is in effect a drop tolerance method. The tolerance is out of user control for the time being. AMLFillFull we accept the full fill matrix. 10.2 Multilevel coarse grid selection strategy We use the Jones-Plassman <ref> [8] </ref> strategy for finding, in parallel, an independent set in the matrix graph. We are then faced with the choice of letting this independent set function as the coarse or as the fine grid.

Reference-contexts: We are then faced with the choice of letting this independent set function as the coarse or as the fine grid. The former is commonly encountered in Algebraic Multigrid methods <ref> [9] </ref>, the latter is the preferred strategy for multi-colour methods.
