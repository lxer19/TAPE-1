Reference-contexts: in that set is said to be a neighbor of node i S i j : The successor set of node i for destination node j i jk : The routing variable assigned to neighbor node k 2 S i j for destination node j, taking values in the set <ref> [0; 1] </ref> s i j : The best successor for destination node j; its routing variable is the maximum within the set S i j jk : Reply status flag for a query sent by node i for j through k The successor sets of the nodal routing tables in G <p> extensions to the DUAL algorithm include the notion of the successor set S i j , which contains all the successor nodes that node i can send traffic to for destination j, and the notion of the routing variable i jk , which is a positive value in the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and specifies the fraction of traffic that should be forwarded to node k for destination j. 2.3 Information at each node Routing information is exchanged among neighbor nodes by means of update messages. <p> Its computation is based on the following equation, where Q q now is the size of that queue at the time of the computation: Q inst = fi fl Q q now + (1 fi) fl Q inst fi is a weighting factor, with values in the set <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; choosing a value for fi close to 0 makes the weighted average immune to changes that last a short time (a single large increase in the queue size); choosing a value close to 1 makes the weighted average respond to changes in the queue size very quickly.

Reference-contexts: Since formulas for D ik involve many assumptions which might be unwarranted, it might be preferable to estimate D 0 ik directly; such estimation procedures are developed by Segall <ref> [2] </ref> and Bello [5]. For our simulation purposes we have used the link cost function formula that is used in the codex network [6]. This function depends on the link flow, but also on additional parameters, such as the link capacity, the processing and propagation delay.

Reference-contexts: These metrics were included in both MDUAL and DUAL for comparison purposes. Finally, we compared the performance of these two algorithms with a minimum-delay routing algorithm referred to as GSS and due to Segall and Sidi <ref> [3] </ref>, which was also extended to incorporate a metric for the queueing delay in the routing decisions. Under stable topology and varying workload, MDUAL always behaves better than DUAL under all performance measures.

Reference-contexts: It gives better throughput than any other algorithm because it has a lower number of dropped packets in the network. GSS appears to have a large number of dropped packets and consequently lower throughput, which verifies the results 73 by <ref> [4] </ref> for the single-path case. From an implementation standpoint, MDUAL is much easier to implement and requires no approximations.

Reference-contexts: Each node broadcasts update messages containing the state of a node's adjacent links to every other node in the network. Routing in today's computer networks is accomplished by distributed shortest-path routing algorithms. The routing algorithms based on the Distributed Bellman-Ford (DBF) algorithm <ref> [6] </ref> are susceptible to the formation of temporary loops. Looping problems are avoided in one of three ways. OSPF [20] relies on broadcasting the complete topology information among routers, and organizes an internet hierarchically to cope with the overhead incurred with any topology broadcast algorithm. <p> More specifically, they are based on single-path routing algorithms, which are ill-suited to cope with congestion, because the only thing they can do to react to congestion is to change the route used to reach a destination. As it has been documented by Bertsekas <ref> [6] </ref>, allowing a single-path routing algorithm to react to congestion can lead to unstable oscillatory behavior. Furthermore, basing a routing decision on such metrics as number of hops or link costs (propagation delay) does not always guarantee that the chosen paths are those with minimum delay. <p> For our simulation purposes we have used the link cost function formula that is used in the codex network <ref> [6] </ref>. This function depends on the link flow, but also on additional parameters, such as the link capacity, the processing and propagation delay.

Reference-contexts: BGP [26] exchanges distance vectors that specify complete paths to destinations. Cisco's EIGRP uses a loop-free routing algorithm based on inter-nodal coordination called DUAL <ref> [10] </ref>. A drawback of the existing routing protocols is that their main routing mechanisms 3 (route computation and packet forwarding) are poorly integrated with congestion control mechanisms. <p> The conditions under which a node engages in a local or a diffusing computation are explained in the following section. 9 2.5 Feasibility Condition The algorithm uses the source node condition, or simply SNC <ref> [10] </ref>, to decide whether or not it should use a local or a diffusing computation to update its routing table, and which neighbors to include in its successor set at any instant. <p> If no such neighbor exists, then node i must maintain its old successor if it has any. The proof that SNC is sufficient to ensure loop freedom can be found in <ref> [10] </ref>. 2.6 Description of the Algorithm The algorithm is specified in pseudo-code form in Figures 2.3 to 2.5, which is based on DUAL. The main change on DUAL is the notion of the successor set for each destination node and the corresponding routing variable for each successor. <p> The main change on DUAL is the notion of the successor set for each destination node and the corresponding routing variable for each successor. The justification for the changes is explained in the sections that follow. The correctness of DUAL can be found in <ref> [10] </ref>. The procedures used for initialization are Init1 and Init2. Procedure Message is executed when a node processes a message, procedures LinkUp, LinkDown and LinkChange are executed when a node detects a new link, the failure of a link, or the change in the cost of the link.

Reference-contexts: It is important to note that the update periods are not synchronized across the network, but they are randomly phased. It has been shown in <ref> [25] </ref> that if update messages by independent nodes become synchronized, it could lead 23 to disruption in network services as the periodic messages contend with other network traffic for link and forwarding resources.

Reference-contexts: We consider the routing algorithms MDUAL, DUAL and GSS operating on two random graphs: N14E28 and N14E47. These graphs were created using the model described in <ref> [31] </ref> with parameters ff = 0:2 and fi = 0:5 (larger values of fi result in graphs with higher edge densities, while small values of ff increase the density of short edges relative to longer ones).

Reference-contexts: Simulations In this chapter, we present the simulation results for MDUAL. The performance of this algorithm is compared with that of DUAL and GSS. 5.1 Simulations in Drama We have developed our simulations using an actor-based, discrete-event simulation language called Drama <ref> [32] </ref> together with a network simulation library. Drama is a C-based simulation language that supports an actor-based computational model, in which actors are independent activities that communicate by passing messages in the context of a discrete-event simulation. This makes it convenient for modeling communication networks.
