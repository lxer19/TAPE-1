Abstract: The Euclidean algorithm is a frequently used tool in the analysis of one-dimensional (1D) multirate systems. This tool is however not available for multidimensional (MD) multirate systems. In this paper we discus how Groebner basis techniques can fill this gap. After presenting the relevant facts about Groebner bases, we will show in a few examples how this technique can contribute to MD multirate systems theory.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Recently there has been much research work done on multidimensional (MD) multirate systems. An overview can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. However, some basic questions have been left untouched. In essence most of these questions boil down to the following question: given a matrix of polyphase components 1 , can we effectively decide whether or not that matrix has a left inverse.

Reference-contexts: The answer to this question is positive, and relies on Groebner bases techniques. Groebner bases (GB) were first introduced by Buchberger in his Ph.D. thesis and popularized by <ref> [2] </ref>. By now the importance of Buch-berger's contribution has been appreciated in many fields, and many good books on the subject have appeared, notably [3]. Moreover, there are now many algebraic systems incorporating Groebner bases techniques: MATHEMATICA and MAPLE are two well known examples.

Reference-contexts: At this point we would like to mention the work of Park and Woodburn <ref> [4] </ref>. Using Groebner bases techniques Park and Woodburn have given a complete parametrization (in terms of ladder structures) of MD bi-orthogonal filter banks with 3 or more channels. Another example of an application of Groebner bases can be found in [5].

In this work the Groebner bases technique is an essential tool for the practical implementation of the Quillen-Suslin theorem. In Section 2. we will derive a mathematical formulation for the three above problems, show how the number "1" is involved, and how to solve them in the 1D case.

Reference-contexts: Some toy examples will be included. 2. The One-dimensional Case To answer the first question we decompose G (z) into its polyphase components G (z) = G 0 (z 2 ) + z 1 G 1 (z 2 ): As noted in <ref> [6] </ref>, the filter G (z) occurs as the low-pass filter in a 2-channel PR filter bank if and only if there exists Laurent polynomials H 0 (z) and H 1 (z) such that G 0 (z)H 0 (z) + G 1 (z)H 1 (z) = 1: (1) Choosing an integer L <p> Note that in the one-dimen sional case, Eq. (7) reduces to a formula which can directly be derived from the Bezout identity (see <ref> [6] </ref> for more details).

Reference-contexts: Moreover, Eq. (3) is also sufficient: in <ref> [7] </ref> it is shown how D can be derived from the data D i (z). Similar to the approach in the first question, the condition of Eq. (3) can be translated into a condition on polynomials. The solution can then be found using the Euclidean algorithm. <p> In this case one easily verifies that D 2 D 1 = 1 and therefore there exist an inverse FIR filter G (z). To find G (z) we first need to find a left inverse G k;l to H k;l . Following the method in <ref> [7] </ref>, the i th row of this left inverse can be found by rewriting P form P j fi j H j;i = 1. The vector ( fi 0 ; fi 1 ; fi 2 ) will then make up the i th row of G k;l .
