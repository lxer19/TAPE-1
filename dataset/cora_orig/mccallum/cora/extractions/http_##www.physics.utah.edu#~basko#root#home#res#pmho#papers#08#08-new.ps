Abstract: We discuss, in the context of M(atrix) theory, the creation of a membrane suspendend between two longitudinal five-branes when they cross each other. It is shown that the membrane creation is closely related to the degrees of freedom in the off-diagonal blocks which are related via dualities to the chiral fermionic zero mode on a 0-8 string. In the dual system of a D0-brane and a D8-brane in type II A theory the half-integral charges associated with the "half"-strings are found to be connected to the well-known fermion-number fractionalization in the presence of a fermionic zero mode. At sufficiently short distances, the effective potential between the two five-branes is dominated by the zero mode contribution to the vacuum energy.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction It was first suggested by Hanany and Witten <ref> [1] </ref> that when two branes (in appropriate configuration) cross each other, a third brane stretching between them is created or annihilated. They observed the creation in type II B string theory of a D3-brane when an NS5-brane crosses a D5-brane. <p> They observed the creation in type II B string theory of a D3-brane when an NS5-brane crosses a D5-brane. It is related to creation of branes of other dimensions by sequences of dualities <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] </ref>. In particular it is dual to the creation of a fundamental string when a D0-brane crosses a D8-brane in type II A theory, as well as the creation of a membrane in M theory when two five-branes sharing one common dimension cross each other. <p> The value of N F for the vacuum changes by one when x 9 crosses zero, showing the need for the creation of a membrane in order to maintain charge conservation. Comparing with the dual II B system of NS5-brane and D5-brane <ref> [1] </ref>, the charge (10) is the total magnetic charge. The charge of the vacuum j0i corresponds to the induced charge due to one of the five-branes on the other five-brane. Due to the jump of the induced charge, conservation of the total magnetic charge requires the creation of a membrane. <p> In [3] it was shown that in II A theory the induced charge on a D8-brane by a D0-brane is one half and it jumps to minus one half when the branes cross. (See <ref> [1] </ref> for the 3 Note that it is a matter of convention to say which state is empty or filled, as well as which operator is the creation or annihilation operator. 7 - N F 1=2 j1i j0i II B analogue.) The charge one half was associated with half a string

In <ref> [2] </ref> it was argued from the anomaly equation that when the two branes in question cross each other an energy level crosses zero, and thus a single particle or hole is created. The creation of a particle is understood as the creation of an open string or brane. <p> It is this chiral fermionic zero mode in the off-diagonal blocks that gives rise to the energy level, which crosses zero, proposed in <ref> [2] </ref> (Sec.2). The energy of this fermionic mode is linear in the distance between the five-branes and the proportional factor equals the membrane tension so that upon quantization it can be associated with the production of membrane (Sec.3). <p> Everytime the energy of the fermionic zero mode crosses zero a particle or a hole is created or annihilated. The underlying physics is simply spectral flow plus filling of the Dirac sea. Following a similar suggestion <ref> [2] </ref> in string theory, we interpret what is created or annihilated, in association with the above particle (hole) creation or annihilation, as a longitudinal membrane. in the present M (atrix) theory context. <p> The jump in the fermion number causes a change in the number of charged fields and thus affects the U (1) anomaly for the 1+1 dimensional field theory <ref> [2] </ref>. In an adiabatic process where x 9 passes zero, a membrane is created so that the total charge is conserved.

By duality we see that this peculiar appearance of half a string is simply originated from the ordering of operators in quantum mechanics.

We will see that this problem is related to the well-known fermion number fractionalization in the presence of a fermionic zero mode (or in general mid-gap state) [9]. Classically, the conserved fermion number for the zero mode is y . <p> Since the state j0i is the ground state for all x 9 , it should be the state corresponding to the string theory calculations in <ref> [10, 4] </ref>. The operator ordering in (11) agrees with the normal ordering when x 9 &gt; 0 but is different from the normal ordering for x 9 &lt; 0. <p> For x 9 &gt; 0, the zero mode is empty and the force vanishes. Comparing the energy for j0i and the effective potential between D0 and D8-branes by duality, we find that indeed j0i is the state corresponding to the string calculations in <ref> [10, 4] </ref>. Note that, contrary to what is suggested in some of the literature, we believe that the change 9 in force for the state j0i when x 9 changes sign is not a signal of membrane creation, rather it is only a result of closed string R-R exchange. <p> Combining Fig.2 (a) and Fig.4, one easily sees that with the created brane included, the net potential (and force) between the two five-branes remains zero when x 9 changes from negative to positive, if initially there is no membrane suspended between them. String theory calculations <ref> [10, 4] </ref> show that the effective potential between a D0-brane and a D8-brane is V = 2 in agreement with our results. The first term above comes from the traces over the NS and R sectors and the second term from the R (1) F sector of open strings. <p> But except those dual to the five-branes discussed above, there is no similar phenomenon because the fermionic zero modes of both chiralities in the transverse direction are paired. 4. Applying our discussions to the case of one D0-brane in the presence of two D8-branes considered in <ref> [4] </ref>, we find for the ground state that the forces in the three regions divided by the two D8-branes are from left to right 2T s , T s and 0, respectively. It is simply the superposition of the forces on the D0-brane due to the two D8-branes. However in [4] <p> <ref> [4] </ref>, we find for the ground state that the forces in the three regions divided by the two D8-branes are from left to right 2T s , T s and 0, respectively. It is simply the superposition of the forces on the D0-brane due to the two D8-branes. However in [4] it was argued that the forces from left to right should be 2T s , 0 and 0, respectively. In their arguments they used the cancellation between two half-strings associated with the two D8-branes as the total induced charge vanishes when the D0-brane lies between the two D8-branes.

It is most convenient to consider the creation of a longitudinal membrane when crossing two longitudinal five-branes. The classical background of the longitudinal five-branes are described by topologically nontrivial gauge field configurations residing in diagonal blocks [7]. <p> Our study indicates that in the M (atrix) model the description of creating an open membrane stretching between two five-branes necessarily involves second quantization of degrees of freedom residing in off-diagonal blocks. 2 Fermionic Zero Mode in Off-Diagonal Blocks The M (atrix) theory is defined by the action <ref> [6] </ref> S = dt T r 1 _ X 2 R (2T M i y _ + 2 2 ) i [X i ; ] ; (1) where i; j = 1; 2; ; 9, R is the radius of the eleventh dimension and T M 2 is the membrane tension.
