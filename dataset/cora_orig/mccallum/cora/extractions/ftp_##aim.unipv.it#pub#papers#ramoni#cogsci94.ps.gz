Reference-contexts: During the past decade, Artificial Intelligence researchers have developed a class of reasoning systems, called Truth Maintenance Systems (tmss) <ref> ( Forbus and de Kleer, 1992 ) </ref> , which are able to deal with partially specified knowledge and to perform inferences in the growth of information.

Reference-contexts: This paper describes a new method for dealing with partial information in probabilistic reasoning, by extending to intervals a logic-based truth maintenance method called Boolean Constraint Propagation <ref> ( McAllester, 1990 ) </ref> . This method will allow us to explicitly distin guish between uncertainty and ignorance. <p> Logic-based Belief Maintenance A logic-based bms (lbms) ( Ramoni and Riva, 1993 ) is a bms in which Boolean connectives of standard logic act as constraints on the probabilistic truth-values of propositions. The lbms can be regarded as a generalization to interval truth-values of the Boolean Constraint Propagation method <ref> ( McAllester, 1990 ) </ref> .

Reference-contexts: Probabilistic logic <ref> ( Nilsson, 1986 ) </ref> provides a semantic framework for extending the standard (Boolean) concept of satisfaction to a probabilistic one, that can be regarded as a generalization of the set-theoretic interpretation of the probability of a proposition.

Reference-contexts: After the description of some of the theoretical and empirical motivations behind the effort of representing ignorance in probabilistic reasoning, we will outline this method and then we will show how it can be used to represent a class of probabilistic reasoning systems called Bayesian Belief Networks (bbns) <ref> ( Pearl, 1988 ) </ref> , thus producing a new class of bbns called Ignorant Belief Networks (ibns), able to reason on the basis of partially specified prior and conditional probabilities.

Reference-contexts: From a logical point of view, it can be regarded as an extensional system based on a set-theoretic interpretation of probability. Logic-based Belief Maintenance A logic-based bms (lbms) <ref> ( Ramoni and Riva, 1993 ) </ref> is a bms in which Boolean connectives of standard logic act as constraints on the probabilistic truth-values of propositions. The lbms can be regarded as a generalization to interval truth-values of the Boolean Constraint Propagation method ( McAllester, 1990 ) . <p> It is apparent that this assumption is too strong. Generalizing definition (2) to interval truth-values, we derived a set of constraints on the minimum and maximum probability of propositions <ref> ( Ramoni and Riva, 1993 ) </ref> .

Reference-contexts: Instead of the 19200 conditional probability required, only 2262 were available (that is, less than 12%), and most of them were affected by ignorance (the mean difference between the maximum and minimum probability of the conditionals was .19) <ref> ( Ramoni et al., 1994 ) </ref> . Still, the system was able to reason and to predict blood glucose values, taking into account the ignorance about the distributions. The crucial problem we found in the representation of ignorance was the discrimination between two states having intersecting probability intervals.

Reference-contexts: The best known support for this "single distribution" assumption is the Dutch Book Theorem, which states that if somebody violates this assumption, he "could have a book against him by a cunning bettor, and would then stand to lose in any event" <ref> ( Ramsey, 1931 ) </ref> . This theorem provides the classical Bayesian theory with a normative character, by proving that a rational agent should behave according to its axioms, including the "single distribution" assumption.
