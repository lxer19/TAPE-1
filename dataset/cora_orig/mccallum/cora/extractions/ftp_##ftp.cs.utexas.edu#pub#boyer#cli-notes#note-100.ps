Abstract: We present here a proof of Ramsey's Theorem for exponent 2 using the Boyer-Moore theorem prover. The presentation is intended to be in a style to assist those who want to learn how to improve their effectiveness in using the Boyer-Moore logic and theorem prover. fl sponsored in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA Orders 6082 and 9151.

Reference-contexts: In this note I show how I used the Boyer-Moore logic and theorem prover to formalize and prove a particular theorem. That is, I chronicle here the development of a mechanically-checked proof of the finite version of Ramsey's Theorem for exponent 2, as contained in <ref> [3] </ref> 1 . In the next section I'll give an introduction to a formalization of this theorem in the Boyer-Moore logic, and in the third and final section I'll give a carefully annotated list of Boyer-Moore events comprising a statement and proof of Ramsey's theorem.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the new proof replays in the unadorned Boyer-Moore theorem prover, while the old proof made extensive use of my "proof-checker" interactive enhancement 5 <ref> [5] </ref>. I did, however, use the proof-checker quite a lot to help me discover useful lemmas to prove in the current effort. <p> One of the two created subgoals would immediately yield to the REWRITE command, using the rewrite rule SUBSETP-HOM-SET-DOMAIN proved in the preceding subsection.

Reference-contexts: I decided that the best way to try to handle this was with the following linear lemma (yes, even though the types are (REWRITE), this is a linear rule, not a replacement rule; see <ref> [6] </ref>): (prove-lemma ramsey-not-zero (rewrite) ;; Used as a linear lemma (lessp 0 (ramsey p q))) This was the other place referred to previously where I already knew about this lemma from the first proof I did of SUBSETP-HOM-SET-DOMAIN under a previous definition of WIT. <p> The prover chugged along until it printed the following formula just before its first generalization. (Generalization is a good place to look for needed lemmas, as explained in the prover's user's manual <ref> [6] </ref>.)
