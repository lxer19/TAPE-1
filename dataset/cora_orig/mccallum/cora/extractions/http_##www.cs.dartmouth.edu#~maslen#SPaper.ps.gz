Title: Sampling of Functions and Sections for Compact Groups  
Author: David Keith Maslen 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate quadrature rules for functions on compact Lie groups and sections of homogeneous vector bundles associated with these groups. First a general notion of band-limitedness is introduced which generalizes the usual notion on the torus or translation groups. We develop a sampling theorem that allows exact computation of the Fourier expansion of a band-limited function or section from sample values and quantifies the error in the expansion when the function or section is not band-limited. We then construct specific finitely supported distributions on the classical groups which have nice error properties and can also be used to develop efficient algorithms for the computation of Fourier transforms on these groups.
