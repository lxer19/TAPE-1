Reference-contexts: Cheeseman and Stutz (1996) have found that discovery of previously unknown structure occurs most frequently when there are many relevant attributes describing each case, because humans are poor at seeing structure in a large number of dimensions. In our first set of classification experiments, we used AutoClass <ref> (Cheeseman and Stutz 1996) </ref>, an unsupervised Bayesian classification system. An input file in a format appropriate for AutoClass was constructed where each instance corresponded to a texel in the image and the feature values are those described above.

Reference-contexts: The feature vector for a texel consists of the mean texel intensity, the standard deviation of the texel intensity, and the five texture features computed in four different directions (a total of 22 features). We have been primarily using a Bayesian classifier called AutoClass <ref> (Cheeseman et al. 1988) </ref> to cluster the texels. In addition, we have just begun using a decision tree classifier called Cobweb (Fisher et al. 1993).

Reference-contexts: For example, the representation of an analyzed acoustic image is a complex object - an object which has other objects as attributes. For purposes of textural analysis, an acoustic image is considered to consist of rectangular cells called texels, or texture elements <ref> (Reed and Hussong 1989) </ref>. Each texel, in turn, consists of a number of pixels (picture elements). These texels are assigned to particular classes, and texels are grouped to together based on these classes to form provinces. <p> Since texture is an attribute of groups of adjacent pixels, it is useful to group pixels into regions called texels and to extract features that describe the texture of the texel. A two-dimensional measure of texture that has proven useful is the gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) <ref> (Reed and Hussong 1989) </ref>. The GLCM provides a measure of the frequency of finding different gray level values within a fixed distance and orientation from one another. This secondary matrix is used to calculate second order texture statistics. <p> Each GLCM is an N g x N g square matrix, and each entry of the GLCM S (i,j;Q,d) represents the number of times there occurs in the image a pixel of intensity i neighbored by a pixel of intensity j in direction Q, at distance d <ref> (Reed and Hussong 1989) </ref>. Texel size is a parameter for the algorithm, and the best texel size is determined empirically. Experiments that we have conducted using different texel sizes are described in the Experiments and Results section.
