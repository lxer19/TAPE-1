Title: A TROFF Tutorial itself normally runs with four fonts, containing roman, italic and bold letters
Author: Brian W. Kernighan 
Note: (updated for 4.3BSD by Mark Seiden) The phototypesetter  
Abstract: troff is a text-formatting program for typesetting on the UNIX operating system. This device is capable of producing high quality text; this paper is an example of troff output. troff allows the user full control over fonts, sizes, and character positions, as well as the usual features of a formatter right-margin justification, automatic hyphenation, page titling and numbering, and so on. It also provides macros, arithmetic variables and operations, and conditional testing, for complicated formatting tasks. This document is an introduction to the most basic use of troff. It presents just enough information to enable the user to do simple formatting tasks like making view-graphs, and to make incremental changes to existing packages of troff commands. In most respects, the UNIX formatter nroff and a more recent version (device-independent troff) are identical to the version described here, so this document also serves as a tutorial for them as well.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction troff <ref> [1] </ref> is a text-formatting program, written originally by J. F. Ossanna, for producing high-quality printed output from the phototypesetter on the UNIX operating system. This document is an example of troff output. The single most important rule of using troff is not to use it directly, but through some intermediary. <p> Strings 8. Introduction to macros 9. Titles, pages and numbering 10. Number registers and arithmetic 11. Macros with arguments 12. Conditionals 13. Environments 14. Diversions Appendix: Typesetter character set The troff described here is the C-language version supplied with UNIX Version 7 and 32V as documented in <ref> [1] </ref>. To use troff you have to prepare not only the actual text you want printed, but some information that tells how you want it printed. (Readers who use roff will find the approach familiar.) For troff the text and the formatting information are often intertwined quite intimately. <p> Normal settings are roman font on 1, italic on 2, bold on 3, and special on 4. There is also a way to get `synthetic' bold fonts by overstriking letters with a slight offset. Look at the .bd.bd command in <ref> [1] </ref>. Special characters have four-character names beginning with "("(, and they may be inserted anywhere.

Reference-contexts: For two special applications, there are programs that provide an interface to troff for the majority of users. eqn <ref> [2] </ref> provides an easy to learn language for typesetting mathematics; the eqn user need know no troff whatsoever to typeset mathematics. tbl [3] provides the same convenience for producing tables of arbitrary complexity. <p> Thus to get S (ab) fi in bare troff we have to type "(*S ("(*a"(mu"(*b) "(-&gt; "(if That line is unscrambled as follows: "(*S S "(*a a "(*b b "(-&gt; fi A complete list of these special names occurs in Appendix A. In eqn <ref> [2] </ref> the same effect can be achieved with the input SIGMA ( alpha times beta ) -&gt; inf which is less concise, but clearer to the uninitiated.

For a handful of numeric columns, you can do it this way: Precede every number by enough blanks to make it line up when typed. .nf 1 tab 2 tab 3 700 tab 800 tab 900 Then change each leading blank into the string "0"0.

(This memo was prepared with `-ms'.) There are also packages for viewgraphs, for simulating the older roff formatters, and for other special applications. <p> As an example of the use of number registers, in the -ms-ms macro package <ref> [4] </ref>, most significant parameters are defined in terms of the values of a handful of number registers. These include the point size for text, the vertical spacing, and the line and title lengths.
