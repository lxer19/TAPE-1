Abstract: The task of modeling, i.e. of creating a set of equations that can be used to predict the behavior of a physical object, is a key step in engineering analysis. This paper describes a computer system, MSG, for generating mathematical models to analyze physical systems involving heat transfer behavior. MSG is motivated by the need for modeling in an automated design process. The models are sets of equations which may include algebraic equations, ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations. MSG uses the strong domain theory to guide model construction in three sequential tasks: identify regions of interests on an object, determine relevant heat transfer and energy storage processes, and transform these processes into equations. The decisions in these tasks are guided by estimates of variation in temperature and material property, and the relative strengths of heat transfer processes.

Since the models are not constructed compositionally but must be provided as complete programs, only a small number of models are available, covering a fairly narrow set of problems. Falkenhainer <ref> [ Falkenhainer, 1992 ] </ref> essentially presents a method of building such a library of complete models, along with rules about when to use each one. He starts with the equations for a full model and with constraints on the possible values of the parameters.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, MSG not only knows what knowledge is required for a model, but also how to put the pieces together into the complete model. This is in contrast to the objectives of interactive modeling systems, such as <ref> [ Finn et al., 1992 ] </ref> (see Section 6). Another motivation for producing as automated a system as possible is the hope that by doing so we will learn more about the basic nature of the modeling process, making it more of a science and less of an art. 2. <p> and selection includes work by Addanki et al [ Addanki et al., 1991 ] , Weld [ Weld, 1992 ] , Viswanath et al [ Viswanath and Jaluria, 1991 ] , Falkenhainer [ Falkenhainer, 1992 ] , Falkenhainer and Forbus [ Falkenhainer and Forbus, 1991 ] , Finn et al <ref> [ Finn et al., 1992 ] </ref> , and Gelsey [ Gelsey, 1989 ] . 25 Both Addanki et al [ Addanki et al., 1991 ] and Weld [ Weld, 1990 ] [ Weld, 1992 ] present methods for choosing among alternative models, but neither focuses on automatically generating the alternative models <p> Our focus is on smaller, more homogeneous, more tightly coupled systems such as modeling the heat transfer through an oven window made of several layers of differing materials. Finn et al <ref> [ Finn et al., 1992 ] </ref> describes an intelligent modeling assistant for analysis in the domain of heat transfer, the same domain as ours. The system is an interactive system which uses features of a new modeling problem to extract possibly-relevant cases from a library of previous modeling decisions. <p> On the other hand, since it does involve a human user it appears more amenable than a totally automatic system would be to handling issues that are currently not well formalized such as approximating complex geometry. It should be noted that as of <ref> [ Finn et al., 1992 ] </ref> this system was only in early stages of implementation; furthermore, the methods by which it will provide 27 advice to the user are not described in any detail.

They give estimations of relative importance of the heat transfer and energy storage processes in an object based on the physical properties and the boundary conditions of the object.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the use of approximate models is effective for the following 4 activities: * In order to start the design, we are interested in finding a good initial design, so that the iterative cycle can converge to a final design faster <ref> [ Jamalabad et al., 1990 ] </ref> . To obtain a good initial design, we may want to take a model that predicts behavior of a given structure, and invert it, so that given a specific behavior it tells us a structure that has that behavior.

They give estimations of relative importance of the heat transfer and energy storage processes in an object based on the physical properties and the boundary conditions of the object. <p> The key things that make MSG work in this domain include the existence of a strong domain theory and a conservation law that ties the individual processes together. These features are present in other domains as well, such as fluid mechanics <ref> [ Panton, 1984 ] </ref> , where the conservation laws are the conservation of mass and momentum, and the basic physical processes are stress, pressure, force, and momentum etc. Furthermore, their model formulation is based on a control region formulation, like that used in the heat transfer domain.
