Abstract: It is shown that balanced n-bit Gray codes can be constructed for all positive integers n. A balanced Gray code is one in which the bit changes are distributed as equally as possible among the bit positions. The strategy used is to prove the existence of a certain subsequence which will allow successful use of the construction proposed by Robinson and Cohn in 1981. Although Wagner and West proved in 1991 that balanced Gray code schemes exist when n is a power of 2, the question for general n has remained open since 1980 when it first attracted attention.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, an n-bit binary Gray code can be viewed as a Hamilton path in the n-cube and a cyclic binary Gray code as a Hamilton cycle. One such cyclic Gray code, the Binary Reflected Gray Code (BRGC), was patented by Frank Gray <ref> [1] </ref> as a solution to a communications problem involving digitization of analogue data.

Reference-contexts: The term "uniformity" refers to the manner in which the bits change in the Gray code. Several different measures of uniformity and techniques to construct Gray codes satisfying these measures have been proposed in literature. Two such measures are the distribution of "transition counts" <ref> [2, 5, 6, 8] </ref> and the "gap" [7] of a code. Gray codes which are uniform with respect to the former measure are referred to as balanced Gray codes. <p> A necessary condition for this to hold for an n-bit Gray code is that n is a power of 2. If n is not a power of 2, following <ref> [2] </ref>, we will call a Gray code balanced if for any two bit positions i and j, jT C (i) T C (j)j 2. Thus, the BRCG is totally balanced for n = 1; 2, balanced for n = 1; 2; 3, but unbalanced for n 4. <p> Several techniques for construction of balanced Gray codes have been proposed. These techniques can broadly be classified into two types. Indirect methods [6, 8] involve the transformation of an existing Gray code to obtain one with the required properties, but they do not guarantee balanced Gray codes. Direct methods <ref> [2, 9] </ref> involve construction of larger Gray codes from smaller ones. The construction of Wagner and West [9], guarantees a balanced Gray code when the number of bits, n, is a power of two. <p> Direct methods [2, 9] involve construction of larger Gray codes from smaller ones. The construction of Wagner and West [9], guarantees a balanced Gray code when the number of bits, n, is a power of two. An ingenious construction proposed in <ref> [2] </ref> produces a Gray code for all n, but balancing the code requires, for each the electronic journal of combinatorics 3 (1996), #R25 3 n, the existence of a subsequence of the transition sequence of a balanced (n 2)-bit Gray code satisfying certain constraints. <p> Robinson and Cohn claim without proof in <ref> [2] </ref> that such a subsequence can always be found. In this paper, we re-examine the construction of Robinson and Cohn and prove that for each n, we can satisfy the constraints required to produce a balanced n-bit Gray code.

Reference-contexts: Suggestions for further investigation follow in Section 4. 2 The Construction of Robinson and Cohn We describe the direct technique suggested by Robinson and Cohn for the construction of balanced Gray codes. The technique is an extension of Gilberts ultracomposite method <ref> [3] </ref> for constructing the BRGC for n-cubes by combining Hamilton cycles from two (n 1)- cubes. In Robinson and Cohn's approach, a Hamilton path for an n-cube is constructed by combining Hamilton paths from four copies of the (n 2)-cube. A stepwise description of the construction is as follows. 1.
