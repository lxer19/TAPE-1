Abstract: Putting it in an AFS directory to which we have read access. [You are on your honor not to The purpose of this assignment is to gain a deeper understanding of how pipelined processors are implemented. Our method of doing this will be to create a C program that simulates pMIPS, a pipelined implementation of a subset of the MIPS architecture. Although C is not an ideal language for describing and simulating hardware designs, one can get a high level view of how the hardware operates by using an appropriate coding style. You can pick up the entire files by copying and untarring the file files.tar. The source files include the following: go snooping around looking for versions of this file from other groups].
