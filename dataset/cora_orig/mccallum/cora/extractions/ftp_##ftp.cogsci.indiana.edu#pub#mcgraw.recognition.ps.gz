Title: Emergent Perception of Gridletters

Abstract: This paper introduces a cognitive model of letter perception based on the principles of emergent computation and high-level perception. The model goes beyond simple categorization by parsing a letterform into its constituent parts. Such parts are formed under the top-down influence of letter concepts. The model currently recognizes letters in many diverse typefaces and will be incorporated into a larger model of creativity | Letter Spirit.

Reference-contexts: 1 Letter recognition at the conceptual level This paper briefly describes a cognitive model of letter perception that is being used as part of the Letter Spirit project. 1 The model is based on the tenets of high-level perception, as described in <ref> [Chalmers et al., 1992] </ref>, in which concepts dynamically provide top-down influence on the formation of perceptual structures during the process of categorization. The resulting perceptual structures, which emerge from the stochastic activities of a large number of tiny processing agents, are well-suited for further analogical processing [Mitchell, 1993].

Reference-contexts: Most optical character recognition (OCR) models take cognitively unrealistic approaches to letter recognition. These approaches share the quality of being shape-based and relying heavily on low-level, syntactic features <ref> [Mantas, 1986] </ref>. In contrast, our psychological studies of human letter recognition indicate that processing occurs at a much higher cognitive level. We hypothesize that letter concepts are composed of a set of conceptual pieces that we call roles [McGraw et al., 1994a].

Reference-contexts: We hypothesize that letter concepts are composed of a set of conceptual pieces that we call roles [McGraw et al., 1994a]. The role hypothesis, briefly described in section 3, is supported by strong psychological evidence <ref> [McGraw et al., 1994b] </ref>. This paper presents a model of letter perception based on the role hypothesis. 2 Why focus on cognitive plausibility of recognition models instead of engineering efficiency? Because human recognition of letterforms (especially highly-stylized ones) is still far superior to that of machines. <p> When the program is complete, its performance will be compared and contrasted to human performance based on letter recognition data reported in <ref> [McGraw et al., 1994b] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The resulting perceptual structures, which emerge from the stochastic activities of a large number of tiny processing agents, are well-suited for further analogical processing <ref> [Mitchell, 1993] </ref>. These perceptual structures include important information about the conceptual makeup of a letterform (as opposed to a simple categorization like "is an `a' "). This "conceptual parsing" turns out to be critical to the design of stylistically similar letterforms | the ultimate aim of Letter Spirit.

Reference-contexts: Graphic letterforms are comprised of parts that fill a letter-conceptualization's roles. During perception, representations of such parts are formed under top-down pressure from roles and are sensitive to context. As stated in <ref> [Palmer, 1978, p.96] </ref>, "components [of parts] enter into relationships with other components, resulting in larger structural units whose importance supersedes that of its constituents." We hold that most of the "importance" attributed to the emerging parts stems directly from their role-filling ability.
