Title: Knowledge Base Merging by Majority  
Author: Jinxin Lin Alberto O. Mendelzon 
Address: Toronto, M5S 1A4, Canada  
Affiliation: Dept. of Computer Science University of Toronto  
Abstract: A common practice for resolving conflicts among a group of agents is to let the majority decide. We formalize this principle and apply it to the problem of merging the knowledge of multiple agents. We then postulate logical properties that all knowledge merging operators should satisfy and give a model-theoretic characterization of all merging operators that satisfy the postulates. It turns out that the operators that satisfy the postulates are precisely those that induce a certain kind of partial pre-order over the set of possible worlds such that the models of the merged knowledge base are the possible worlds that are minimal with respect to the pre-order. Then, we review several previous approaches and study them in light of the proposed postulates. We then present a particular method for knowledge merging, CMerge, that satisfies all the postulates. We show by example that CMerge appears to resolve conflicts among knowledge bases in a plausible way. Finally, we show that CMerge can be implemented by an efficient syntactical transformation from the set of knowledge bases to be merged.

Reference-contexts: The method of Revesz [Rev94] also does not take majority into account. For the above example, it returns the same result as the one of Baral et al. Borgida and Imielinski <ref> [BI84] </ref> proposed several approaches to resolve a conflict in beliefs held by a collection of experts (which they called a "committee"). However, using their protocols, committees may remain indecisive or contradictory on the conflicting issues. <p> In the following, the result of merging is usually a set of sentences. For the first three approaches, the result can be viewed as the set of all sentences that the protocol supports. 5.1 "All Support" Protocol In <ref> [BI84] </ref>, Borgida and Imielinski discuss a protocol where a group of agents is defined to support a sentence ff if every agent in the group support ff. Let us call this "All support" protocol. <p> Then the result of the protocol is also a tautology a _ :a. The conflict on a is not resolved by majority. 2 5.2 "Democracy" Protocol Borgida and Imielinski <ref> [BI84] </ref> also propose a "Democracy" protocol described as follows.

Reference-contexts: We will define the distance between a possible world and a set of knowledge bases as the sum of the distances between the world and each knowledge base, where the distance to a single knowledge base is defined using the method of Dalal's <ref> [Dal88] </ref>, which is simply the minimum number of atoms on which the world differs from some model of the knowledge base. 6.1 The Definition Let the distance between two possible worlds w 1 and w 2 , dist (w 1 ; w 2 ), be the number of atoms whose valuations

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In many fields such as heterogeneous databases [BAP92] or genomic information systems [Fre91] we are often confronted with multiple and conflicting sources of information. Systems organized around reasoning agents <ref> [HM85, FH88] </ref> face the similar problem of resolving conflicts among contradictory knowledge or beliefs 1 held by different agents.

For example, if an agent knows a and another agent knows a ! b, then combining their knowledge yields b, even though neither one of them individually knows b. <p> Halpern and Moses <ref> [HM85] </ref> defined the notion of implicit knowledge in a group of agents. But their formulation of implicit knowledge applies only to agents who do not have conflicting views; if there is a conflict, the implicit knowledge of the agents is every sentence in the language.

Reference-contexts: But their formulation of implicit knowledge applies only to agents who do not have conflicting views; if there is a conflict, the implicit knowledge of the agents is every sentence in the language. Majority rule is used in many other fields, notably social choice theory (see, e.g., <ref> [Kel88] </ref>). However, the majority postulate we formalize in this paper is specifically designed for knowledge merging and is different from the majority rule in the other fields. This is due to the fact that our postulate includes a notion of `partial support' defined in the paper. <p> On the other hand, various voting schemes 2 studied in social choice theory <ref> [Kel88] </ref> cannot accomplish the purpose of knowledge merging. For example, we would like to achieve new knowledge b by merging two knowledge bases fag and fa ! bg. But since neither knowledge base supports b, b cannot be obtained through "voting" by the knowledge bases.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, our approach in this paper will produce a, which reflects the view of the majority. Furthermore, our approach is independent of the particular syntax of the knowledge bases to be merged, while the method of Baral et al. is syntax-dependent. The method of Revesz <ref> [Rev94] </ref> also does not take majority into account. For the above example, it returns the same result as the one of Baral et al. Borgida and Imielinski [BI84] proposed several approaches to resolve a conflict in beliefs held by a collection of experts (which they called a "committee").
