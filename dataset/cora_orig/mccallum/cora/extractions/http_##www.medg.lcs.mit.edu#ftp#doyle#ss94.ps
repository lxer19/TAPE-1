Abstract: Decision-theoretic preferences specify the relative desirability of all possible outcomes of alternative plans. In order to express general patterns of preference holding in a domain, we require a language that can refer directly to preferences over classes of outcomes as well as individuals. We present the basic concepts of a theory of meaning for such generic compar-atives to facilitate their incremental capture and exploitation in automated reasoning systems. Our semantics lifts comparisons of individuals to comparisons of classes "other things being equal" by means of contextual equivalences, equivalence relations among individuals that vary with the context of application. We discuss implications of the theory for represent ing preference information.

Reference-contexts: Boutilier has recently proposed qualitative preference relations based on the concept of preference in the most likely or "normal" worlds <ref> (Boutilier, 1993) </ref>. This preference, "all else being normal" contrasts directly with our preference, "all else being equal".

Reference-contexts: Finally, we relate the formalization provided here with that developed in our previous treatments (Wellman and Doyle, 1991; Doyle et al., 1991). The first version of the theory, presented in <ref> (Wellman and Doyle, 1991) </ref> and based on pure attributive representations of outcomes, provided a definition of preferential superlatives (i.e., goals) but not of preferential comparatives. The second version, presented in (Doyle et al., 1991), generalized the definition to comparatives, but phrased everything in terms of a logical (boolean attribute) representation. <p> The first version of the theory, presented in (Wellman and Doyle, 1991) and based on pure attributive representations of outcomes, provided a definition of preferential superlatives (i.e., goals) but not of preferential comparatives. The second version, presented in <ref> (Doyle et al., 1991) </ref>, generalized the definition to comparatives, but phrased everything in terms of a logical (boolean attribute) representation. In particular, the definition of equivalence used was based on a syntactic notion of support rather than taking the notion of equivalence relation as primitive. <p> Thirty years ago, G. H. von Wright (von Wright, 1963; von Wright, 1972) proposed a "logic of preference" founded on the notion of preference ceteris paribus. The definition we employed in our "logic of relative desire" <ref> (Doyle et al., 1991) </ref> was very similar to that adopted in the logic of preference, although von Wright did not uncover or address the difficulties inherent in syntactic treatment of the "all else" being held equal.

We come to this problem from a somewhat different (complementary) perspective, aiming to define logical constructs that avoid commitments to the precise form of utility, at the expense of perhaps providing weaker preference information.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we note that the semantics developed here formalize the methods in our previous work on decision-theoretic planning, which defined preference for a proposition by specifying a positive qualitative influence on utility <ref> (Wellman, 1990) </ref>. The use of qualitative influences in that work suggests how to extend our framework to account for preferences over ordinally scaled quantities in addition to propositions.
