Abstract: The nonsymmetric Lanczos method has recently received significant attention as a model reduction technique for large-scale systems. Unfortunately, the Lanczos method may produce an unstable partial realization for a given, stable system. To remedy this situation, inexpensive implicit restarts are developed which can be employed to stabilize the Lanczos generated model.

Reference-contexts: The Lanczos algorithm simultaneously computes the projector, k , and a tridiagonal ^ A with only O (k 2 n) operations. Employing the Lanczos method for model reduction is discussed in a multitude of recent papers including <ref> [1, 4, 23, 32, 33, 34] </ref>. Model reduction via a Krylov projector is certainly cheaper, O (k 2 n), than with an "optimal" reduction technique, O (n 3 ), when n k. However, Pade approximation and more specifically Lanczos-based model reduction is known to suffer from three significant disadvantages. 1. <p> But with or without restarts, it is rather obvious that the projector corresponding to these Krylov spaces does a poor job of modeling the low-frequency response of the CD player. Similar results are observed in the modeling of Tokamak plasmas in <ref> [1] </ref>. The order of k must approach that of n before sufficient low-frequency information is included in the Lanczos model. As mentioned in the introduction, a solution to this problem is to incorporate information from A 1 into the Krylov spaces.

Reference-contexts: At least for the SISO case, the first problem can be solved. Look-ahead can be incorporated into the Lanczos method [19, 20, 13] to avoid singularities in the Pade table. And in many of the above references, the second problem is handled by moment matching about multiple frequencies <ref> [2] </ref>. For example, incorporating information from the Krylov spaces K (A 1 ; b) and K (A T ; c T ) into the projector leads to moment matching about s = 0.

Reference-contexts: At the heart of the CD player is an optical unit (consisting of a laser diode, lenses, and photodetectors) which is mounted on the end of a radial arm <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> Therefore rather than working with the entire CD player mechanism, four smaller SISO systems are studied. In particular, this example concentrates on the relationship between the lens actuator and lens position. Traditionally, the behavior of the lens position is represented by a third-order differential equation <ref> [5] </ref>. However, controllers designed from these simple, low-order systems experience difficulties when employed in the newer, portable Compact Disc players [5]. External physical shocks must now be taken into consideration which leads to higher order models. <p> In particular, this example concentrates on the relationship between the lens actuator and lens position.

One can only expect as much. In <ref> [7] </ref>, it is shown that there are at most k (k + 1) shifts, , for which the HR decomposition of (T k I) fails to exist. Hence avoiding ill-conditioned problems may demand that one take better advantage of the degrees of freedom afforded by the shifts i .

Reference-contexts: In [31], QR steps (see [17]) are combined with the Arnoldi method to yield an implicitly restarted approach. In this section, a process denoted as the HR step is incorporated into the nonsymmetric Lanczos method in order to yield Lanczos restarts. As opposed to the implicit Lanczos restarts of <ref> [9] </ref> for the symmetric case, it should be stressed that the techniques developed below are for the nonsymmetric Lanczos method. <p> However, this extra expense can be limited if the value of k can be kept sufficiently small. We refer to Section 4 for more details on these aspects. 2.2 The HR decomposition In <ref> [9, 31] </ref>, the decomposition (T k I) = QR and the corresponding QR step, ~ T k = Q T T k Q, play a key role in implicit restarts for the symmetric Lanczos method.

The technique of <ref> [10] </ref> may be generalized to maintain this bi-orthogonality. Our limited experience with this indicates that it is possible to maintain numerical bi-orthogonality at the level of round-off in working precision.

Reference-contexts: For stable, open loop problems (i.e., systems in which no feedback is applied), the need for stable reduced-order models in undeniable. One example of this class of problems is the simulation of large-scale circuits <ref> [14, 28] </ref>. But for problems in which feedback is present, one is typically more interested in the accurate modeling of the unstable modes. The stabilizing controller for a large-scale plant is typically developed through the analysis of a reduced-order model.

Reference-contexts: But regardless of how quickly k can be computed, one is certainly also interested in the correspondence between the original system fA; b; cg and reduced-order system f ^ A; ^ b; ^cg.

Reference-contexts: A more complete discussion of these two observations is postponed until Section 4. The approach taken for implicitly restarting the Lanczos method is completely analogous to one developed in [31] for the Arnoldi method. In [31], QR steps (see <ref> [17] </ref>) are combined with the Arnoldi method to yield an implicitly restarted approach. In this section, a process denoted as the HR step is incorporated into the nonsymmetric Lanczos method in order to yield Lanczos restarts. <p> This subsection primarily establishes notation.

A standard implementation of the Lanczos method is provided as Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 1. Given b and c put fi 1 = p jb T cj and fl 1 = sign (b T c)fi 1 . <p> An algorithm for computing H and R for an S-symmetric tridiagonal matrix is provided in detail in [6, 7]. To briefly sketch out this technique, first define a Givens rotation <ref> [17] </ref> as H g (i; j) = 6 6 4 c s s c 3 7 7 where the c = cos () and s = sin () entries are in the (i; i) th , (i; j) th , (j; i) th and (j; j) th positions. <p> When this symmetry is only present in an S-symmetric sense, one must turn to the hyperbolic rotation <ref> [17] </ref> H h (i; j) = 6 6 4 c s s c 3 7 7 : If jx i j &gt; jx j j, the values of c = cosh () and s = sinh () are selected so that s c x i " q i x 2 0 <p> As with explicit QR steps, the expense of explicit HR steps comes from the fact that both H 1 and H must be explicitly computed. A preferred alternative is the implicit HR step, an analogue to the Francis QR step <ref> [17] </ref>. The first implicit rotation, H (1; 2), is selected so that the first columns of the implicit and explicit H are equivalent. The remaining implicit rotations H (i; i + 1) perform a bulge-chase sweep down the tridiagonal. <p> The remaining implicit rotations H (i; i + 1) perform a bulge-chase sweep down the tridiagonal. As the implicit HR step is completely analogous to the implicit QR step for symmetric tridiagonal matrices (including the handling of shifts and double shifts <ref> [17] </ref>), this technique will not be discussed here in detail. Before this discussion of the HR algorithm is concluded, one additional result will be needed to aid in the development of implicit Lanczos restarts.

Reference-contexts: Any decomposition of the form ^ H ^ R where ^ H = HD, ^ R = D 1 R, and D is a diagonal scaling could be used in an implicit restart. For example, in <ref> [18] </ref> a prototype of the implicitly restarted Lanczos method was developed with ^ H computed via LR decompositions.

Reference-contexts: However, Pade approximation and more specifically Lanczos-based model reduction is known to suffer from three significant disadvantages. 1. Singularities in the Pade table (ill-conditioned leading submatrices in the system's Hankel matrix) lead to "serious" breakdowns in the nonsymmetric Lanczos algorithm [27]. 2.

Lanczos methods are already being applied to model reduction problems in the area of control <ref> [4, 23, 34] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Such an A can arise, for example, out of finite-element discretizations of various plants including chemical processes and mechanical systems. Conventional model reduction techniques are ill-suited for large, sparse problems due to the sheer size of A. For example, many of the "optimal" reduction strategies (balanced realization <ref> [25] </ref>, Hankel norm optimal [16], etc.) require knowledge of the solutions to the Lyapunov equations AG c + G c A T + bb T = 0 and A T G o + G o A + c T c = 0: (3) Standard computational techniques for solving (3) entail O

Reference-contexts: Primary among these concerns is the loss of bi-orthogonality between V k and W k . In theory, the three-term recurrences in (8) and (9) are sufficient to guarantee W T k V k = I. Yet in practice, it is known <ref> [26] </ref> that bi-orthogonality will in fact be lost when at least one of the eigenvalues of T k converges to an eigenvalues of A.

Reference-contexts: However, Pade approximation and more specifically Lanczos-based model reduction is known to suffer from three significant disadvantages. 1. Singularities in the Pade table (ill-conditioned leading submatrices in the system's Hankel matrix) lead to "serious" breakdowns in the nonsymmetric Lanczos algorithm <ref> [27] </ref>. 2. Using Koenig's theorem [21], it can be shown that matching Markov parameters (corresponding to an expansion of G (s) about s = 1) leads to a reduced-order model f ^ A; ^ b; ^cg which tends to approximate the high frequency poles of A [22]. <p> Even with nonzero shifts, it is quite possible that the vector v 1 = (A p I) (A 1 I)v 1 will be dominated by information from only a few of the largest (in absolute value) eigenvalues of A (recall (30)). As a result, a near fortuitous Lanczos breakdown <ref> [27] </ref> would soon occur at some step i and the residual vector, r i , would consist of noise. An implicit restart, on the other hand, directly forms V kp from the wide range of information available in V k . <p> If there are two starting vectors, (A I)v 1 and (A I) T w 1 , for which an explicit Lanczos restart breaks down, it is impossible to tridiagonalize A with any projector corresponding to these starting vectors <ref> [27] </ref>. The HR decomposition of (T k I) cannot exist in this situation; otherwise a tridiagonal ~ T k could be constructed. This turns out to be the only way that breakdowns in the HR decomposition can occur. A serious breakdown [27] of the Lanczos process beginning with starting vectors (A <p> A with any projector corresponding to these starting vectors <ref> [27] </ref>. The HR decomposition of (T k I) cannot exist in this situation; otherwise a tridiagonal ~ T k could be constructed. This turns out to be the only way that breakdowns in the HR decomposition can occur. A serious breakdown [27] of the Lanczos process beginning with starting vectors (A I)v 1 and (A I) T w 1 will occur at the j-th step if and only if the j-th (hyperbolic) rotation of the implicit restart process fails to exist. <p> Moreover block versions of the above schemes ought to be 21 developed for dealing with the case where B and C are not just vectors (see e.g. the CD player example used in section 3.2). The occurrence of ill-conditioned table entries is well-studied in the Lanczos algorithm <ref> [27] </ref>, where it is termed a "serious" breakdown. By employing look-ahead into the Lanczos method, [19, 20, 13], one possesses a powerful tool for detecting and avoiding ill-conditioned table entries. Along similar lines, block versions of these algorithms should be developed in order to cope appropriately with the MIMO case.

Reference-contexts: For stable, open loop problems (i.e., systems in which no feedback is applied), the need for stable reduced-order models in undeniable. One example of this class of problems is the simulation of large-scale circuits <ref> [14, 28] </ref>. But for problems in which feedback is present, one is typically more interested in the accurate modeling of the unstable modes. The stabilizing controller for a large-scale plant is typically developed through the analysis of a reduced-order model.

Reference-contexts: Restating Theorem 1, the reduced order model is a Pade approximation (partial realization) of the original system. Model reduction via Pade approximation (explicit moment matching) has a long history in the literature <ref> [29, 30, 37] </ref>. Thus the observations of [35] are certainly of interest. But the concept of using oblique projectors to perform the Pade approximation can be taken one step further by forming V k and W k via a two-sided, nonsymmetric Lanczos method [24]. <p> One can thus consider restarts with non-negative shifts as a way to emphasize the high-frequency modes in k and thus also in T k . Such interpretation corresponds well to the observation <ref> [29] </ref> that unstable realizations are obtained by better approximations of the original system's high-frequency modes. Unfortunately, stabilizing a realization leads to discrepancies between the moments of the actual and reduced-order systems. <p> As mentioned in the introduction, a solution to this problem is to incorporate information from A 1 into the Krylov spaces. Work along these lines is still needed to guarantee the accurate reproduction of the low-frequency dynamics. But regardless of this fact, we stress the observation of <ref> [29] </ref>: the number of spurious, unstable modes in the reduced-order model tends to increase as emphasis is placed on the low-frequency modes. Incorporating A 1 into the Krylov spaces may increase the need for implicit restarts.

Reference-contexts: Analogous to the implicitly restarted Arnoldi method of <ref> [31] </ref>, this approach incorporates shifted HR steps [6, 7] into the nonsymmetric Lanczos method to produce k . In Section 3, the relationship between the modification of the projector and the resulting reduced-order model is explored. <p> These statements are offered at this point only to motivate the need for implicit restarts. A more complete discussion of these two observations is postponed until Section 4. The approach taken for implicitly restarting the Lanczos method is completely analogous to one developed in <ref> [31] </ref> for the Arnoldi method. In [31], QR steps (see [17]) are combined with the Arnoldi method to yield an implicitly restarted approach. In this section, a process denoted as the HR step is incorporated into the nonsymmetric Lanczos method in order to yield Lanczos restarts. <p> A more complete discussion of these two observations is postponed until Section 4.

In [31], QR steps (see [17]) are combined with the Arnoldi method to yield an implicitly restarted approach. In this section, a process denoted as the HR step is incorporated into the nonsymmetric Lanczos method in order to yield Lanczos restarts. <p> However, this extra expense can be limited if the value of k can be kept sufficiently small. We refer to Section 4 for more details on these aspects. 2.2 The HR decomposition In <ref> [9, 31] </ref>, the decomposition (T k I) = QR and the corresponding QR step, ~ T k = Q T T k Q, play a key role in implicit restarts for the symmetric Lanczos method. <p> It would be preferable to obtain (15,16) directly from (8,9) using an implicit restart mechanism analogous to the technique introduced in <ref> [31] </ref>. This implicit restarting mechanism will now be derived. <p> Then the eigenvalues of T k are f 1 ; : : : ; k g. Proof: The proof follows from extending Theorem 2, result (iii), to the case of multiple shifts. Alternatively, a proof completely analogous to one for the Arnoldi method <ref> [31, Theorem 2.8] </ref> can be developed. 2 Restarting with exactly p eigenvalues of T k+p as the shifts deflates out these p eigenvalues from T k .
