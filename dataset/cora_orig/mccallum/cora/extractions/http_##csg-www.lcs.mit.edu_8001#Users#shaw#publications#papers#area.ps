Title: Fixed-Length Packets versus Variable-Length Packets in Fast Packet Switching Networks  
Author: Andrew Shaw 
Date: 3 March 1994  
Abstract: Fast Packet Switching (FPS) networks are designed to carry many kinds of traffic, including voice, video, and data. In this paper, we evaluate one design parameter of FPS networks: whether the packets should be fixed-length or variable-length. We consider three measures of performance: user frame loss rates, average latency, and effective bandwidth.

There are two factors which argue for smaller packets. First, small packets allow the pipelining of frames through switches, which reduces the queue memory requirements and latency. PTM cells need to be fully received before being forwarded across the switch (store and forward).

Reference-contexts: a standard which has been developed by CCITT, and which has become the dominant manifestation of FPS [9] [16]. "PTM" can be used to describe a few network designs, such as IBM's plaNET, as well as the Frame Relay standard for data networks, which has also been standardized by CCITT <ref> [6] </ref>. The primary difference between ATM and PTM is that ATM packets are fixed-sized and small, and PTM packets are variable-sized and may be fairly large. There are other differences between the two, such as the routing methods, which we will not explore in this paper. <p> As in <ref> [6] </ref> and [12], we assume PTM packets with header lengths of 12 bytes. Neither ATM nor PTM packets directly implement user-level data packets (such as IP packets) which we will call frames. <p> This frame loss rate has different characteristics depending upon whether the network is ATM or PTM.

Reference-contexts: In reality, no one knows what the traffic patterns will look like. 2.7 Interaction with Higher-Level Protocols FPS networks will be used to transport data using existing protocols and interfacing to existing, non-FPS networks. <ref> [10] </ref> argues that PTM more closely maps to the current protocols (TCP/IP) than ATM, because of its those protocols also have variable-sized frames. <p> Cidon, Gopal, et al <ref> [10] </ref> argue that such costs would require extra computer power to handle the segmentation and reassembly costs. <p> A higher input multiplexing ratio will increase the frame loss ratio because successive cells in the queue will become less correlated with regard to their original user-level frames, and more frames will be lost to the "avalanche" effect described in <ref> [10] </ref>. A higher cell loss ratio will also increase the frame loss ratio. switch total bandwidth This is a constant which describes the total output bandwidth. user effective bandwidth This is the bandwidth which is available to the users of the system. <p> For instance, Le Boudec [12] uses two different analytical models to describe ATM behavior, depending upon the length of the queue buffer, and both models were inadequate to describe even longer queues. Cidon et al <ref> [10] </ref> use an ATM latency model described by Parekh and Sohraby [14] to argue for PTM, but Parekh and Sohraby use simulations to present their results. <p> The simulator does not simulate output contention in detail, because all of the packets passing through the switch are aggregated into the same queue. Although this is a very crude model, it is in essence identical to the assumptions made in the studies comparing fixed-length and variable-length packet formats <ref> [10] </ref> [12] [14] [13]. 14 M/D/1 queueing system 4.1.4 Simulator Test To test out the accuracy of the simulator, we have simulated two well-known queueing systems and compared them against the theoretical behavior. The M/M/1 queueing system models Poisson arrivals and exponentially distributed frame lengths. <p> For higher rates of multiplexing, we can use much smaller queues to maintain the same loss ratio. 4.5 Frame Loss versus Multiplexing and User Utilization Because the loss of a single ATM cell will usually cause the loss of an entire user frame, Cidon et al <ref> [10] </ref> contend that ATM will cause catastrophic losses because cells are not correlated, and thus a queue overflow will tend to cause the loss of many different frames. This implies that they believe higher multiplexing rates will cause higher frame loss. <p> A real study would compare the performance of ATM and PTM on real traffic in a real environment on real hardware. The plaNET project at IBM is perhaps the most serious implementation of a PTM network whose intended traffic is the same as for ATM networks. In <ref> [10] </ref>, some of the designers of plaNET describe some of the recent modifications to plaNET which allow it to support ATM style traffic without overhead in terms of the packet format. <p> To get a feel for the relationships between the possible variables which can affect the performance measurements for each, we built a simulator and performed experiments to show general characteristics of ATM and PTM switch behavior. Our results qualitatively agree with the results of in <ref> [10] </ref> [12] [13] [14]. At low user utilizations, ATM is superior to PTM, but at higher utilizations, ATM reaches the saturation region (when the latency increases exponentially as a function of the bandwidth utilization) more quickly than PTM because of its higher format overheads.

Reference-contexts: As in [6] and <ref> [12] </ref>, we assume PTM packets with header lengths of 12 bytes. Neither ATM nor PTM packets directly implement user-level data packets (such as IP packets) which we will call frames. <p> Since PTM is a variable-length packet format, extra information must be inserted into the packet to distinguish the data within the packet from the marker for the end of the packet. This overhead is called "bit-stuffing", and according to <ref> [12] </ref>, this is a 3.2% overhead for the data portion of the PTM packet. 4. There are standard protocols (ATM Adaptation Layers) for using ATM cells to transmit variable length user frames, and these protocols consumes four bytes of the data field for additional protocol information. <p> However, ATM has an advantage over PTM because the buffer utilization is smoothed out due to the segmentation and multiplexing of ATM cells. ATM's smaller cells require less queue memory, and therefore reduce the cell loss rate. As is argued in <ref> [12] </ref>, in some cases ATM can overcome its format inefficiency by using less queue memory, and therefore perform at a higher effective bandwidth for an equal frame loss rate. 2.5 Latency primary components of latency are the packetization and depacketization, the transmission delay, the switching delay, and the queueing delay. <p> Furthermore, they do not note the path between input multiplexing ratio, average cell latency, cell loss ratio and frame loss ratio. This is described by Le Boudec in <ref> [12] </ref>, where he notes that the increase in frame loss due to the "avalanche effect" is sometimes made up by a decrease in the average cell latency, causing a decrease in the cell loss ratio, causing a decrease in the frame loss ratio. <p> Analytical models are interesting and useful, but are often quite cumbersome to develop and limited in their applicability. For instance, Le Boudec <ref> [12] </ref> uses two different analytical models to describe ATM behavior, depending upon the length of the queue buffer, and both models were inadequate to describe even longer queues. <p> Although this is a very crude model, it is in essence identical to the assumptions made in the studies comparing fixed-length and variable-length packet formats [10] <ref> [12] </ref> [14] [13]. 14 M/D/1 queueing system 4.1.4 Simulator Test To test out the accuracy of the simulator, we have simulated two well-known queueing systems and compared them against the theoretical behavior. The M/M/1 queueing system models Poisson arrivals and exponentially distributed frame lengths. <p> This implies that they believe higher multiplexing rates will cause higher frame loss. Le Boudec <ref> [12] </ref> claims that the increased multiplexing rates will decrease queue usage, and thus will decrease cell loss faster than the increase in the avalanche effect. <p> To get a feel for the relationships between the possible variables which can affect the performance measurements for each, we built a simulator and performed experiments to show general characteristics of ATM and PTM switch behavior. Our results qualitatively agree with the results of in [10] <ref> [12] </ref> [13] [14]. At low user utilizations, ATM is superior to PTM, but at higher utilizations, ATM reaches the saturation region (when the latency increases exponentially as a function of the bandwidth utilization) more quickly than PTM because of its higher format overheads.
