Reference-contexts: We used the binary edge images and the thinned images which can be obtained using the edge detection algorithm [12] and the thinning algorithm <ref> [1] </ref> as test images. The numbers in Table 3 and 4 represent the accumulated distances between the input and reference image. The larger number means the less similarity.

Reference-contexts: In section 2, the four-dimensional DSWA is described to explain the concept of warping. In section 3, we show how to map this four-dimensional DSWA onto two-dimensional array processor, the MGAP, which is a fine-grained and mesh-connected array processor <ref> [6] </ref>. In section 4, we show the anticipated performance of the DSWA on the MGAP and compare it with the DSWA on the CM-200. Finally some experimental results with the various kinds of images are shown. 2. <p> Compute the local distance d i,j,k,l based on a distance measuring method 2. Compute d v (i,j,k,l) and d h (i,j,k,l) 3. Compute d (i,j,k,l) -. 3. Implementation of the DSWA on the MGAP The MGAP is a fine-grained, mesh-connected array processor which is easily scalable and reconfigurable <ref> [6] </ref>. It consists of an N x N array of digit processors. Each processor is connected to its four nearest neighbors. However, it is possible for each processor to receive input from different neighbor by configuring them differently.

Kim, </author> <title> A study on image information processing : Development of automatic personal verification system by fingerprint, </title> <type> Ph.D. Dissertation, </type> <institution> Tokai University, </institution> <address> Japan, </address> <year> 1989. </year>
Reference-contexts: In our test with sample fingerprint images, the DSWA recognized the distorted and misregistered fingerprints very well. It should be noted that distortion and misregistration by noise is one of the hardest problems in fingerprint recognition systems <ref> [7] </ref>. We can see that the small amount of warping distance significantly improves the recognition power. 5. Conclusion and Future Study We have shown a new mapping strategy of the DSWA onto two-dimensional array pocessor to reduce the communication complexity and increase the performance by data pipelining and interleaving.

Reference-contexts: The Table 1 shows the number of cycles taken for some relevant operations. To implement the DSWA on the MGAP, the four-dimensional algorithm must be mapped into two-dimensions. From the four-dimensional dependence graph (DG) we can derive a two-dimensional signal ow graph (SFG) using a multiprojection method <ref> [8] </ref>. A previous mapping projected DG by to derive a SFG where is a diagonal vector in the plane and is a diagonal vector in the plane [16]. Our new mapping scheme projects DG by to derive the SFG. Fig. 3 shows the comparison of these two SFGs.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In image recognition systems, space warping problems such as shrinking, enlarging, distortion, and noise are considered hard problems. The computation of the distance between two finite areas with a dynamic programming algorithm based on insertion and deletion was proposed by R. Moore <ref> [11] </ref>. However, it cannot solve space warping problems because only insertion and deletion are used.

Reference-contexts: We ran the DSWA on various kinds of images and Table 3 and 4 shows that the DSWA can solve image warping problems like shrinking, enlarging, and distortion. We used the binary edge images and the thinned images which can be obtained using the edge detection algorithm <ref> [12] </ref> and the thinning algorithm [1] as test images. The numbers in Table 3 and 4 represent the accumulated distances between the input and reference image. The larger number means the less similarity.
