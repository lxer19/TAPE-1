Title: Impulse-based Dynamic Simulation

Abstract: We introduce a promising new approach to dynamic simulation called impulse-based simulation. The distinguishing feature of this method is the unification of all types of contact (colliding, rolling, sliding, and resting) under a single framework; non-colliding contacts are simulated as a series of tiny microcollisions. The approach is simpler and more robust than previous constraint-based methods. Simulation results agree with physical experiments, and the method is fast enough to make real time simulation possible. In the course of describing impulse-based simulation, we present an efficient collision detection scheduling scheme and a fully general treatment of frictional collisions. We conclude with some of the results generated by our simulator.

Reference-contexts: Newton's forte is the formulation and simulation of constraint-based dynamics for linked rigid bodies. It has been used to simulate a high degree of freedom walking robot [16], although the contact modeling is fairly simplistic. Baraff has published a great deal on simulation of bodies in contact <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. His work focuses on the resolution of forces when bodies are in resting (non-colliding) contact. His earlier work is for frictionless collisions, and he later showed that computing contact forces in the presence of friction is NP-hard [3]. <p> Finally, impacts are not easily incorporated into the constraint model, as they generally give rise to impulses, not constraint forces present over some interval. These collision impulses must be handled separately, as in <ref> [1] </ref>. In contrast, our system is based on a method we call impulse-based dynamic simulation. Unlike constraint-based methods, no constraints are imposed on the configurations of the moving objects; when the objects are not colliding, they are in ballistic trajectories. <p> A priori, the collision detection system only reports a possible collision, because the objects may be receding. If the closest points are moving away from each other, no collision impulse should be applied. (c.f. Baraff's constraint, f (f ) = 0 <ref> [1] </ref>.) The contact velocities are computed from u i = v i + w i fi r i : (1) The relative contact velocity u is simply u 1 u 2 . If the z-component of u is non-negative, the objects are not colliding, and no action is taken.

Consider a ball rolling along a table top. The normal force which the table exerts on the ball is a constraint force that does not do work on the ball, but only enforces a non-penetration constraint.

Reference-contexts: Wang and Mason have studied impact dynamics for robotic applications; their approach is based on Routh's, but deals only with the two-dimensional case [17].

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, these early approaches all suffered from inefficient collision detection and unrealistic assumptions concerning impact dynamics (e.g. infinite friction at the contact point). Our method combines fast collision detection with a fully general treatment of frictional collisions.

Often, this integration step size is chosen to be "small enough so that no collisions are missed" (such as in <ref> [6] </ref>), but this is ad hoc and forces a small step size even when one is not necessary. We employ a strategy which reduces the number of collision checks from the naive approach, facilitates an adaptive step size for dynamic B. Mirtich and J.

Reference-contexts: Electronic prototyping allows the engineer to interactively test and modify designs while they are still on the drawing board, before an actual prototype is ever constructed <ref> [8] </ref>. Experiments which are too costly or impractical to perform can be simulated, such as failure mode tests of bridges or dams. Even experiments which are performed today, such as automobile crash tests, can be done at much lower cost and under more varied conditions.

Before describing our method of computing p, we state the assumptions. Assumption 1 (Infinitesimal collision time) The duration of a collision is negligible compared to the time over which simulated objects move appreciably. <p> This is a common assumption made in dynamic simulation <ref> [9] </ref>. The second part simply means that, unlike ordinary forces which can only affect accelerations instantaneously, the collision impulses can instantaneously affect velocities. Such behavior is necessary if we are to prevent objects from interpenetrating once they come into contact.

Reference-contexts: Determining the correct equations of motion for the ball means keeping track of these changing constraints, which can become complicated. Moreover, it is not even clear what type of constraint should be applied; there exist at least two models for rolling contact which in some cases predict different behaviors <ref> [10] </ref>. Finally, impacts are not easily incorporated into the constraint model, as they generally give rise to impulses, not constraint forces present over some interval. These collision impulses must be handled separately, as in [1]. In contrast, our system is based on a method we call impulse-based dynamic simulation. <p> The answer is that the ball rolls in circles, not centered at the axis of the platter, which gradually increase in radius until the ball rolls off of the platter <ref> [10] </ref>. When confronted with this problem, our simulator produced this very result, again verifying the collision model and the feasibility of generating correct macroscopic behavior through microcollisions (figure 11). 5.2 Conclusion The impulse-based method is an excellent, new technique for dynamic simulation for two reasons: speed and accuracy.
