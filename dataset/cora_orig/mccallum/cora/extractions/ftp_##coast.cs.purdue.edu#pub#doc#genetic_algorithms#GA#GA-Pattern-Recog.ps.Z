Abstract: We describe an immune system model based on a universe of binary strings. The model is directed at understanding the pattern recognition processes and learning that take place at both the individual and species levels in the immune system. The genetic algorithm (GA) is a central component of our model. In the paper we study the behavior of the GA on two pattern recognition problems that are relevant to natural immune systems. Finally, we compare our model with explicit fitness sharing techniques for genetic algorithms, and show that our model implements a form of implicit fitness sharing.

Reference-contexts: An elaborate genetic mechanism involving the combinatorial association of a number of gene segments underlies the construction of these receptors, so that an animal has the genetic capability of expressing over 10 10 different receptors on B cells <ref> [1] </ref> and over 10 16 different receptors on T cells [3]. In mice and humans, it is thought that the resident population of lymphocytes express a repertoire of about 10 7 different receptors at any time.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the individual cells and molecules (lymphocytes, antibodies, etc.) that comprise the immune system encode and operate the control mechanism in parallel. The enormous diversity of the molecules employed by the immune system is the key to its pattern recognition capabilities. The underlying principle is called clonal selection <ref> [2] </ref>. Clonal selection is related to Darwin's theory of natural selection but applied to the cell populations within the immune system. Recognition in the immune system is performed by B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes. Each lymphocyte expresses receptor molecules of one particular shape on its surface.

When a foreign molecule or cell is encountered there is a high probability that it will bind to the receptors on some lymphocytes.

Reference-contexts: Deb considers the case in which there are q peaks that one wishes the GA to find and maintain, and these peaks are equidistant (in terms of the given distance metric) from one another in the search space <ref> [5] </ref>. He also shows how to set s such that q hyperspheres of radius s fill the search space. Then, under Deb's assumptions, one and only one peak lies in each hypersphere of radius s . <p> Note the similarity to Sh (d ij ) for ff &lt; 1 and various values of s (see Figure 1). and the implicit sharing in the immune system simulations. In fitness sharing, s is a strict cutoff based on d ij , which Deb <ref> [5] </ref> recommends setting based on the volume of a hypersphere around a given peak. In the immune system algorithm, dictates a cutoff based on V j (m), which is the proportion of the population within a hypersphere of radius m 1 around a given antigen.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we analyze the behavior of the model by showing that it is related to earlier fitness sharing algorithms developed for GAs. 2 Binary Immune System Model Our immune system model is based on a universe first introduced by Farmer et al. <ref> [7] </ref> in which both antigens and antibodies are represented by binary strings. This is certainly a simplification from the real biology in which genes are specified by a four-letter nucleic acid alphabet and recognition between antibodies and antigens is based on their three-dimensional shapes and physical properties.

Reference-contexts: Using this basic idea, many different specific functions can be defined that are linear or nonlinear in l i . We have studied several different match functions, including simple linear, exponential, and threshold functions <ref> [8] </ref>. Here we shall use the simplest of these functions: M 0 = i M 0 simply counts the total number of bits that differ between antigen and antibody. Using the bit string representation for antibodies, we construct random populations of antigens and antibodies.

Reference-contexts: Finally, ff j is the probability of selecting antigen j for matching. The probability that w antibodies at exactly distance m from antigen j are in a sample of size taken without replacement from this population, p (w; ; N; N j (m)), is given by the hypergeometric distribution <ref> [9, 15] </ref>: p (w; ; N; N j (m)) = N j (m) ! w The j s (d ij )ff j term is related to the fitness available to a given antibody i, but the antibody can share in the finite fitness resources available at many distant antigens.

Reference-contexts: The model uses genetic algorithms (GAs), an idealized computational model of Darwinian evolution based on the principles of genetic variation and natural selection <ref> [16, 10] </ref>. The GA without crossover is a reasonable model of clonal selection, while the GA with crossover models genetic evolution. In this paper we formulate abstract versions of pattern recognition problems that the immune system appears capable of solving. We then solve these problems using the GA.

Reference-contexts: It appears that the immune system has learned that bacteria need to be recognized in a special way. Assuming that this type of learning takes place through natural selection, the genetic algorithm <ref> [16, 11] </ref> provides a natural model for studying evolution of antibody and T cell receptor V region genes. We have developed a model directed at understanding the pattern recognition processes and learning that takes place at both the individual and species levels in the immune system. <p> These patterns are analogous to the "schemas" described in the GA literature <ref> [11] </ref>. Experiments were conducted using the GA described for Problem 2. For these experiments we used a population of 100 antibodies (initialized randomly), ran the GA for 500 generations, used crossover and mutation rates of 0.5 and 0.001, respectively, and varied 17 between experiments.

Reference-contexts: would tend not to do well in this problem because the antigen that a specialist antibody recognizes is unlikely to be presented to the that same antibody in subsequent generations (unless is very high). 3.2 How well can the GA detect common schemas? Using the Genesis public domain software package <ref> [13] </ref>, modified to accommodate our fitness function, we studied how the GA solves Problem 1, in which antigens contain predefined schemas.

Reference-contexts: The model presented here makes the important simplification that a bit string represents both the genes that code for an antibody and the phenotypic expression of the molecule. For example, mutation operates on the bit string and causes antibodies to mutate. In another model <ref> [14] </ref> we explicitly consider V-region genes, the construction of antibody molecules by joining a set of small gene segments, and recombination of genes between individuals in a population. Here antibodies are created directly rather than by genetic operations on a set of gene segments.

Reference-contexts: To perform these tasks the immune system must be capable of distinguishing self cells and molecules, which it should not destroy, from foreign cells and molecules (antigens), which it should destroy. The enormity of this task has not been fully quantified, but Inman <ref> [17] </ref> has calculated that the immune system appears to be able to recognize at least 10 16 foreign molecules.

Reference-contexts: Under this scheme, however, the antibodies would also match all self molecules. Thus, it would be better to require that each foreign antigen be recognized by at least one antibody, and that no self molecule be recognized. Percus et al. <ref> [18] </ref> explicitly consider this problem. <p> However, as the criterion for matching becomes more specific one can avoid matching self while at the same time still matching foreign molecules <ref> [18] </ref>. 3 Two Pattern Recognition Problems From the basic immune system model described in Section 2, many variations can be created by changing details such as the types of antigens to be recognized and the method by which antibodies are chosen to be matched against antigens.

Reference-contexts: The degree of match is quantified by a matching function M : Antigen fi Antibody ! &lt;. Figure 1 illustrates the matching procedure. There are many possible match rules that are plausible physiologically <ref> [19] </ref>. For example, M can simply count the number of complementary bits or M can identify contiguous regions of complementary bitwise matches within the string.

Reference-contexts: For clonal selection to work efficiently the receptors on lymphocytes need to be diverse enough to recognize essentially any antigen. Immunologists call a repertoire complete if there exists at least one receptor that can recognize any antigen. Using a probablistic model Perelson and Oster <ref> [20] </ref> define precise conditions for repertoire completeness and show that if the 10 7 receptors in the repertoire are made at random then one would expect the repertoire to be complete. However, receptors are not made entirely randomly. <p> Typically tens or hundreds of different antibodies are found that match an antigen with sufficient strength to be important in an immune response. From the work of Perelson and Oster <ref> [20] </ref> one can estimate that if antibodies are made at random, then about 10 5 antibodies would be required to cover the space of antigens. Since the immune system employs about 10 7 different antibodies, one would expect an average of 100 antibodies to recognize each antigen.

Reference-contexts: This means that at most 2 bits could differ between the string and the pattern in order for the string to be counted as a representative. In a previous paper in which we analyzed the diversity algorithm theoretically <ref> [21] </ref>, we made the following predictions for the three peaks case: 1. At sample size = 2 (below the number of peaks), generalization will occur with negligible representatives at other peaks. 2. <p> To show how maintaining population diversity in the immune system model is similar to fitness sharing, we have calculated an antibody's expected fitness under the diversity algorithm. The details of this calculation are given elsewhere <ref> [21, 22] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 illustrates the matching procedure. There are many possible match rules that are plausible physiologically [19]. For example, M can simply count the number of complementary bits or M can identify contiguous regions of complementary bitwise matches within the string. Stadnyk <ref> [23] </ref> introduced a function M that computes the lengths l i of the complementary regions, and combines them such that long regions are rewarded more than short ones. Using this basic idea, many different specific functions can be defined that are linear or nonlinear in l i .
