Reference-contexts: Many invertebrates are also capable of sophisticated forms of learning and motivated behavior (Colgan, 1989). Alkon (ch. 1 of Byrne & Berry, 1989), Hawkins (ch. 5 of Byrne & Berry, 1989), and Byrne and his colleagues <ref> (Buonomano, Baxter, & Byrne, 1990) </ref> have found evidence for facilitator neurons in the mollusks Aplysia and Hermissenda.

Reference-contexts: We are not aware of other neural network models that explicitly deal with motivation. However, the idea of drive neurons that modulate learning is found in several other neural network models. The models of Klopf <ref> (ch. 7 of Byrne & Berry, 1989) </ref> and Sutton and Barto (1990) explicitly incorporate the idea of a drive neuron. Klopf's drive-reinforcement theory suggests that changes in the drive level have reinforcing properties. <p> Many invertebrates are also capable of sophisticated forms of learning and motivated behavior (Colgan, 1989). Alkon <ref> (ch. 1 of Byrne & Berry, 1989) </ref>, Hawkins (ch. 5 of Byrne & Berry, 1989), and Byrne and his colleagues (Buonomano, Baxter, & Byrne, 1990) have found evidence for facilitator neurons in the mollusks Aplysia and Hermissenda. <p> Many invertebrates are also capable of sophisticated forms of learning and motivated behavior (Colgan, 1989).

Reference-contexts: However, Grossberg's model extends Hull's ideas by including both drive induction and drive reduction, and by describing dynamic aspects of behavior and learning, rather than static relationships. A detailed discussion of the relationship between Hull's drive reduction theory and Grossberg's neural theory of conditioning can be found elsewhere <ref> (see especially Ch.1 Grossberg, 1986) </ref>. We are not aware of other neural network models that explicitly deal with motivation. However, the idea of drive neurons that modulate learning is found in several other neural network models.
