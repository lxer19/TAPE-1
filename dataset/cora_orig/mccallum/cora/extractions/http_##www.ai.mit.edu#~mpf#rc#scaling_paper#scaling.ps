Title: Reversibility in optimally scalable computer architectures Revision: 1.21

Abstract: An important goal for computer science is to find practical, scalable models of computation that are as efficient as is permitted by the laws of physics. Physics implies fundamental constraints on the efficiency of computations that produce entropy. As a result, it appears that the most efficient possible computers must use reversible primitive operations which produce arbitrarily little entropy. In this paper we show that a 3-D mesh of reversible processor chips, constructible using existing technology, scales better than any physically possible computer based on irreversible primitives.

Reference-contexts: current irreversible circuit technology actually inefficiently generates around 10 8 bits of physical entropy per bit of computational state that is discarded! However, irreversible operations and the accompanying production of entropy are actually not required for any computation, as was shown by Lecerf '63 [11] and independently by Bennett '73 <ref> [1] </ref>. Unfortunately, it seems that computations that produce no entropy may, at least in some cases, require either more computational space or more time (by an unboundedly large factor) than their counterparts in (nonphysical) models in which unwanted information is permitted to simply disappear [6].

Reference-contexts: This relationship between irreversible computational operations and physical entropy was apparently first pointed out by Landauer '61 [10]. A good, though somewhat dated review of the resulting research is provided by Bennett '82 <ref> [2] </ref>. Thus, direct execution of conventional irreversible models implies a certain minimum entropy be generated with each operation, proportional to the number of bits of computational state that are discarded by the operation. <p> The rate of computation that could be sustained within a given region would then be limited only by the packing density and maximum rate of the individual processing elements. However, it may be physically impossible to achieve true zero-entropy computation while maintaining a constant non-zero rate of processing. Bennett <ref> [2] </ref> has described a hypothetical clockwork computer that can operate solely via Brownian motion, and produces no entropy.

Reference-contexts: The recent studies of quantum computing (e.g. [13], brief review in <ref> [5] </ref>) suggest that if it is possible to implement machines that can maintain and manipulate indefinitely large coherent states, then it is this class of machine that will achieve the asympotically highest possible efficiency on some problems, such as factoring.

Reference-contexts: Bennett's Brownian computer can be operated with speed proportional to entropy per operation, if a small driving force is used to keep the machine running forwards steadily. Fredkin and Toffoli '78 <ref> [7] </ref> proposed an early reversible electronics that had this scaling, based on inductors and capacitors.

Reference-contexts: If the physical entities that carry information around inside a computer move totally frictionlessly, and interact without any loss of energy, then no entropy need be produced. For example, ballistic motion is the basis for the idealized "billiard ball" model of reversible computation proposed by Fredkin and Toffoli <ref> [8] </ref>. However, we do not know of any way to make a system that operates purely ballistically, at some constant nonzero speed. Indeed, this may not be physically possible.

Reference-contexts: We already know of some important classes of problems for which efficient 3-D algorithms can indeed be completely reversible and, in principle, produce no entropy. In particular, there is volumetric simulation of 3-D reversible physical systems; see the examples in <ref> [14] </ref>. A reversible model of computation can solve such problems more efficiently than any irreversible machine. This result is not just theoretical.
