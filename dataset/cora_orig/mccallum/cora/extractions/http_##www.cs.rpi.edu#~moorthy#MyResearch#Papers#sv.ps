Abstract: We present several elegant methods used in GraphPack, an educational package, for three dimensional embedding of graphs, as well as a two dimensional layout method, namely barycentric embedding. After that, a program for automatic recognition of graphs is introduced. In addition, we show how graphs in GraphPack format can be exported into Xfig format. Finally, we describe the client/server capabilities of GraphPack designed for providing communication with other tools and application programs written in C and C++. Keywords: Graph theory, educational tool, visualization of graphs, embedding graphs, manipulating embeddings, recognition of graphs, client/server model.
