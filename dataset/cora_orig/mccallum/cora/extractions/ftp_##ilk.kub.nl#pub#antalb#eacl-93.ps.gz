Abstract: It is traditionally assumed that various sources of linguistic knowledge and their interaction should be formalised in order to be able to convert words into their phonemic representations with reasonable accuracy. We show that using supervised learning techniques, based on a corpus of transcribed words, the same and even better performance can be achieved, without explicit modeling of linguistic knowledge. In this paper we present two instances of this approach. A first model implements a variant of instance-based learning, in which a weighed similarity metric and a database of prototypical exemplars are used to predict new mappings. In the second model, grapheme-to-phoneme mappings are looked up in a compressed text-to-speech lexicon (table lookup) enriched with default mappings. We compare performance and accuracy of these approaches to a connectionist (backpropagation) approach and to the linguistic knowledge based approach.

Reference-contexts: This approach implies that dependencies stretching longer than the length of the graphemic window cannot be learned. 2.2 Instance-Based Learning As an example of a lazy learning approach, we experimented with Instance-Based Learning (IBL, <ref> [ Aha et al., 1991 ] </ref> ). IBL is a framework and methodology for incremental supervised machine learning. The distinguishing feature of IBL is the fact that no explicit abstractions are constructed on the basis of the training examples during the training phase. <p> When using a Euclidean distance metric (geometrical distance between two patterns in pattern space), all features are interpreted as being equally important. But this is of course not necessarily the case. We extended the basic IBL algorithm proposed by <ref> [ Aha et al., 1991 ] </ref> with a technique for assigning a different importance to different features.

Reference-contexts: As a typical architecture for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion in Dutch, consider the modules fl This report is a preprint of a paper to be published in the Proceedings of the 6th Conference of the European Chapter of the ACL, Utrecht, April 1993. 1 in <ref> [ Daelemans, 1988 ] </ref> shown in Figure 1. It contains most of the traditional datastructures and processing components proposed by computational linguists. A problem with this approach is that the knowledge needed is highly language-dependent and requires a significant amount of linguistic engineering. <p> Model Generalisation Accuracy on Phonemes BP 91.3 TABLE 95.1 3.2 The Linguistic Knowledge-Based Approach The traditional linguistic knowledge-based approach of grapheme-phoneme conversion has produced various examples of combined rule-based and lexicon-based models, e.g. MITalk ( [ Allen et al., 1987 ] ) for English, grafon-d ( <ref> [ Daelemans, 1988 ] </ref> ), and morpa-cum-morphon ( [ Nunn and Van Heuven, 1993 ] ) for Dutch. The developers of all of these models shared the assumption that the presence of linguistic (phonotactic, morphological) knowledge is essential for a grapheme-phoneme model to perform at a reasonably high level.

Reference-contexts: Our approach to the problem of weighing the relative importance of features is based on the concept of Information Gain (IG), also used in learning inductive decision trees, [ Quinlan, 1986 ] , and first introduced (as far as we know) in IBL in <ref> [ Daelemans and Van den Bosch, 1992 ] </ref> in the context of a syllable segmentation task. The idea is to interpret the training set as an information source capable of generating a number of messages (the different categories) with a certain probability.

Reference-contexts: In linguistics, a similar emphasis on analogy to stored examples instead of explicit but inaccessible rules, is present in the work of a.o. <ref> [ Derwing and Skousen, 1989 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: Finally, as far as algorithms are concerned, IBL finds its inspiration in statistical pattern recognition, especially the rich research tradition on the nearest-neighbour decision rule (see e.g. <ref> [ Devijver and Kittler, 1982 ] </ref> , for an overview). 2.2.1 Basic Algorithm and Extensions The main datastructure in our version of IBL is the exemplar, a memory structure representing about each pattern the following information: (i) Its distribution over the different categories (training patterns may be ambiguous between different categories,

Reference-contexts: The application of compression techniques like our table method to the phonemisation problem has not yet been reported on as such in the literature. In <ref> [ Golding and Rosenbloom, 1991 ] </ref> , the interaction of rule-based reasoning and case-based reasoning in the task of pronouncing surnames is studied. It is claimed that a hybrid approach is preferable, in which the output of the rules is used unless a compelling analogy exist in the case-base.

Reference-contexts: In morpa-cum-morphon ( [ Nunn and Van Heuven, 1993 ] ), a state-of-the-art system for Dutch, grapheme-phoneme conversion is done in two steps. First, morpa ( <ref> [ Heemskerk and Van Heuven, 1993 ] </ref> ) decomposes a word into a list of morphemes. These morphemes are looked up in a lexicon. Each morpheme is associated with its category and a phonemic transcription.

Reference-contexts: A new data-oriented version of morpa ( <ref> [ Heemskerk, 1993 ] </ref> ) assigns a priority ordering to the set of morphological decompositions, based on a probabilistic grammar derived from a corpus of examples of correct decompositions. This new approach raises the overall performance of morpa-cum-morphon to 88.7%, which remains slightly worse than the table method.

Reference-contexts: The Information Gain metric we use in our version of IBL is domain-independent and can be efficiently computed. Another case-based system (or rather a hybrid combination of case-based reasoning and relaxation in a localist interactive activation network) is PRO ( <ref> [ Lehnert, 1987 ] </ref> ). The reported performance of this system is not very convincing, however, neither is the need for a combination of connectionist and case-based techniques apparent.

Their conclusion is that BP consistently outperforms ID3 because the former captures statistical information that the latter does not. However, they demonstrate that ID3 can be extended to capture this statistical information.

Reference-contexts: In the example of &lt;schoenen&gt;, this phonetic null insertion results in the following alignment: To provide a learning system with sufficient information about the phonemisation task, context information must be added. In the models described below, this is done by using graphemic windows (compare <ref> [ Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987 ] </ref> ), i.e. fixed-length parts of words in which one grapheme is mapped to a phoneme; the other graphemes serve as context. <p> Automatic learning of grapheme-phoneme conversion of English (NETtalk, <ref> [ Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987 ] </ref> ) has been acclaimed as a success story for BP. The approach was replicated for Dutch in NetSpraak ( [ Weijters and Hoppenbrouwers, 1990 ] ). It is therefore appropriate to compare our two data-oriented models to BP. <p> Earlier work on the application of Memory-Based Reasoning ( [ Stanfill and Waltz, 1986; Stanfill, 1987 ] ) (another form of case-based reasoning) to the phonemisation problem using the NetTalk data (MBRTalk), showed a better performance than NetTalk itself ( <ref> [ Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987 ] </ref> ), however at the cost of an expensive, domain-dependent computational measure of dissimilarity that seems to be computationally feasible only when working on a massive parallel computer like the Connection Machine. <p> For English, we used the benchmark NetTalk corpus as used in <ref> [ Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987 ] </ref> . For French, we extracted word-pronunciation pairs from Brulex, a lexical data base for French ( [ Content et al., 1990 ] ).

Reference-contexts: Unsurprisingly, the target grapheme is most informative, and context features become less informative the further they are removed from the target. We also found that right context is more informative than left context (compare <ref> [ Weijters, 1991 ] </ref> ). 2.3 Table Lookup with Defaults Our table lookup model can be seen as a link between straightforward lexical lookup and similarity-based reasoning.
