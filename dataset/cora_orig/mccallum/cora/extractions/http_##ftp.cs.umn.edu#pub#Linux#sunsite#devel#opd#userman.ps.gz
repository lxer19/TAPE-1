Reference-contexts: We need to fully exploit this predictability without limiting DSP++ to only support regular data flow. 7.5.1 Data input/output model A general mechanism for modeling such data flow and using the model to schedule process execution is described in <ref> [7] </ref>. We incorporate some of these 38 7. THE DSP++ LANGUAGE ides in our data flow model. We support processes that have one or more input and one or more output nodes and consume and emit data as follows.
