Abstract: We present a general method for using automatic differentiation to facilitate model sensitivity analysis. Automatic differentiation techniques augment, in a completely mechanical fashion, an existing code such that it also simultaneously and efficiently computes derivatives. Our method allows the sensitivities of the code's outputs to its parameters and inputs to be determined with minimal human effort by exploiting the relationship between differentiation and formal perturbation theory. Employing this method, we performed a sensitivity study of the MM5 code, a mesoscale weather model jointly developed by Penn State University and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, comprising roughly 40,000 lines of Fortran 77 code. Our results show that AD-computed sensitivities exhibit superior accuracy compared with divided differences approximations computed from finite-amplitude perturbations, while consuming comparable or less CPU time and less human labor. We also comment on a numerically induced precursor wave that would almost certainly have been undetectable if one used a divided difference method.

Reference-contexts: The initial condition data for MM5 are constructed by a suite of preprocessors [15] by using a modified Cressman objective analysis scheme <ref> [9, 1] </ref>. Objective analysis is the term meteorologists use for any method of interpolating a set of irregularly spaced weather observations onto a regular computational grid. <p> This simulation is straightforward because the modified Cressman update formulas are linear in the observed data <ref> [15, 9, 1] </ref>; hence, the impact of perturbing a single temperature observation will be to perturb the initial conditions at each grid point in the vicinity of the selected observation in proportion to the value of its proximity-weighting factor.

In addition, since a grid-point is coupled to its neighbors via the "stencil" pattern of the differencing scheme, an unphysical "computational wave" will propagate across the grid at one stencil radius per time step.

Reference-contexts: These features suggest that the precursor represents something more nearly akin to a "computational diffusion" than to a true wave. One should expect that both physical and numerically induced precursors may appear in the results of any simulation code.
