Reference-contexts: Arbitrary asynchronous behavior of the manager is tolerated too. Of course, if it is slow, the overall execution will suffer. For the design and the implementation of the Calypso software system, and a complete description of manager and worker processes, see <ref> [2] </ref>. 1.3 Hardware & Software Requirements Hardware. Any commercial off-the-shelf PC with an 80386, 80486, Pentium, Pentium Pro or compatible processor and a minimum of 8MB RAM (16MB is recommended) is suitable to run Calypso. To use several workstations, they must be connected as a network. Software.
