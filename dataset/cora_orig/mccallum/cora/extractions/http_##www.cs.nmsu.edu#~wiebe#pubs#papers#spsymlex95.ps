Title: Towards the Acquisition and Representation of a Broad-Coverage Lexicon  
Author: Rebecca Bruce and Janyce Wiebe

Abstract: Statistical techniques for NLP typically do not take advantage of existing domain knowledge and require large amounts of tagged training data. This paper presents a partial remedy to these shortcomings by introducing a richer class of statistical models, graphical models, along with techniques for: 1) establishing the form of the model in this class that best describes a given set of training data, 2) estimating the parameters of graphical models from untagged data, 3) combining constraints formulated in propositional logic with those derived from training data to produce a graphical model, and 4) simultaneously resolving interdependent ambiguities. The paper also describes how these tools can be used to produce a broad-coverage lexicon represented as a probabilistic model, and presents a method for using such a lexicon to simultaneously disambiguate all words in a sentence.

Reference-contexts: The final tool is a technique for resolving multiple, mutually-constraining ambiguities in graphical models. Model Selection Part of the lexicon will be derived statistically from training data. To do this, an appropriate probabilistic model must be formulated. In previous work <ref> (Bruce and Wiebe 1994ab) </ref>, we used a method for model formulation that selects informative contextual features and identifies the decomposable model (a kind of graphical model) that is the best approximation to the joint distribution of word senses and these features.

Reference-contexts: Models in this class are capable of characterizing a rich set of relationships between a large number of variables, where these variables may be spatially separated and may also be of different types (e.g., class-based vs. specific collocations). The models we refer to are called "graphical models" <ref> (Whittaker, 1990) </ref>. The probability distribution of a graphical model corresponds to a Markov field. This is because a graphical model is a probability model for multivariate random observations whose dependency structure has a valid graphical representation, a dependency graph.
