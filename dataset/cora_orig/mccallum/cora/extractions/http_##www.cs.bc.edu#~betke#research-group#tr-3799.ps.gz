Abstract: The problem of recognizing objects imaged in complex real-world scenes is examined from a parametric perspective using the theory of statistical estimation. A scalar measure of an object's complexity, which is invariant under affine transformation and changes in image noise level, is extracted from the object's Fisher information. The volume of Fisher information is shown to provide an overall statistical measure of the object's recognizability in a particular image, while the complexity provides an intrinsically physical measure that characterizes the object in any image. An information-conserving method is then developed for recognizing an object imaged in a complex scene. Here the term "information-conserving" means that the method uses all the measured data pertinent to the object's recognizability, attains the theoretical lower bound on estimation error for any unbiased estimate of the parameter vector describing the object, and therefore is statistically optimal. This method is then successfully applied to finding objects imaged in thousands of complex real-world scenes.

Reference-contexts: From the computer vision perspective, we consider the interpretation of J as an information measure to be far more useful than its interpretation as the inverse of the theoretical lower bound on estimation error. Our approach and purpose therefore stands apart from Cernuschi-Frias et al.'s <ref> [4] </ref>. For example, in the type of optical pattern recognition problems encountered with low-variance CCD camera measurements, the associated bounds on object positional resolution fall in the sub-pixel regime, and are somewhat of an overkill.

Reference-contexts: An analytic proof of this can be found in Ref. <ref> [14] </ref>. However, a more practical experimental proof of our method's statistical optimality is readily provided by inspection of Figure 9. Over the entire global peak, the weighted matched filter, a comparison of noiseless object replicas versus noisy image data, is indistinguishable from the autocorrelation of the coincident noiseless object replicas.
