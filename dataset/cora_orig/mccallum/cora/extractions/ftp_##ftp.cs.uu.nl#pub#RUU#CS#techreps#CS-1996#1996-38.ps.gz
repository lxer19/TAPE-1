Title: Algorithms for Fixture Design  
Author: Chantal Wentink A. Frank van der Stappen Mark Overmars 
Abstract: Manufacturing and assembly processes often require objects to be held in such a way that they can resist all external wrenches. The problem of "fixture planning" is to compute, for a given object and a set of fixturing elements, the set of placements of the fixturing elements that constrain all finite and infinitesimal motions of the object (due to applied wrenches). As fixturing problems occur frequently in manufacturing and assembly, it becomes costly to build a dedicated fixturing solution for each different problem. Modular fixturing toolkits offer the advantage of reusability of the fixturing elements and have therefore gained considerable popularity. A modular fixturing toolkit consists of a fixturing table with a rectangular grid of holes, and a set of fixturing elements whose positions are restricted to the holes in the table. Several recent publications in the field of fixture planning aim at exploring the power of these modular fixturing toolkits. We give an overview of modular and non-modular fixture planning for various types of objects and sets of fixturing elements.

Reference-contexts: The second part of the paper deals with modular fixtures which is a subject of considerable popular interest in the manufacturing industry for the past ten years or so [1, 2, 13, 14]. Basically, this involves a regular square grid of lattice holes together with fixture elements (or fixels <ref> [5] </ref>) that are constrained by the grid; the object rests against these fixels which constrain its motions. <p> The existence of modular fixtures in this model was investigated by Zhuang et al. [31]. They proved a negative result (they identified a set of non-fixturable polygons). A complete algorithm to compute all possible form closure configurations was described by Brost and Goldberg <ref> [5] </ref>. We review both results briefly. Non-fixturability Intuitively one can see that a very small or long and skinny part might be unfixturable in the model, since three of the point-contacts (associated with the locators) must occur at a grid point. <p> Since the part should contact three locators (placed at grid points) in order to obtain a form closure configuration, this regular polygon cannot be fixtured under the 3L=1C model. 23 Algorithm to compute all form closures Brost and Goldberg <ref> [5] </ref> presented an algorithm that computes all possible form closure configurations in the 3L=1C-model for polygonal objects. The algorithm is complete, since it outputs all possible form closure configurations. Furthermore, the algorithm can identify the optimal fixture according to an arbitrary quality metric. <p> The set of correct contact normals obtained with the force-sphere analysis, is then mapped back onto the part perimeter and intersected with the horizontal and vertical grid-lines to obtain the clamp-positions that give a form closure configuration. Brost and Goldberg prove the following theorem. Theorem 14 <ref> [5] </ref> All configurations holding P in form closure with three locators and one clamp can be computed in time O (n 4 d 5 ). <p> For the clamps we can either test for intersecting afterwards or use similar techniques. Finally, the size of the edge-fixels never causes a problem (it only shifts the polygon with respect to the grid). For example, the algorithm of Brost and Goldberg <ref> [5] </ref> thus needs time O (n 5 d 5 ). The time complexity of the vise-algorithm of Wallack and Canny [29] (Theorem 17) does not change. <p> Several quality measures have been proposed in literature based on the smallest contact force necessary to resist applied forces [9, 18]. One such measure is the radius of the largest sphere that can be embedded inside the wrench convex [12, 17]. Brost and Goldberg <ref> [5] </ref> describe a quality metric that is used to rank the fixtures obtained by their algorithm for three locators and a clamp. The metric allows the user to specify a list of expected forces on the part.

Reference-contexts: Then the three vectors ! ca i , a i 2 (M IC (P ) " @P ), positively span R 2 . The time to compute the maximal inscribed circle of a polygon P (M IC (P )) is O (n) both for convex and non-convex polygons <ref> [7] </ref>. This can be done by computation of the medial axis of P , the center of the M IC (P ) is a vertex of the medial axis of P . We also use the following lemma that can easily be proved. <p> The construction though is not very stable and therefore rather impractical. The time to compute a form-closure configuration depends on the time needed to compute the maximal inscribed circle of P . This is O (n) <ref> [7] </ref>. 6 Modular Fixtures In this section we consider fixturing polygonal 2-dimensional objects with modular fixturing systems. We are given a rectangular flat surface into which circular holes have been drilled to form a regular square lattice.

Three dimensional fixturing Markenscoff et al. showed that for three-dimensional polyhedra, seven frictionless point contacts are necessary and sufficient to fixture the part <ref> [19] </ref>. In addition Wagner et al. [28] proposed a three-dimensional modular fixturing system using seven struts that are mounted to the walls of a rectangular four-sided frame on which mounting-sockets are arranged in a regular grid.

Reference-contexts: It seems quite hard to do this, since we do not only have to deal with a discrete number of possible clamp positions, but also with four continuous degrees of freedom, namely the four extensions of the clamp plungers.

Remember that the distance between two adjacent grid points on a grid line is 1.

Such segments are now called Nguyen segments. <p> Some of the algorithms can be extended or changed such that additional cases can be dealt with as well. Here we give a short overview of a 38 number of known extensions. Computation of Nguyen regions Nguyen <ref> [22] </ref> introduced an algorithm to compute Nguyen regions of an object in a model with four point contacts. Nguyen regions define possible placements of the point contacts, such that form closure is obtained if we place at least one contact in every region.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Many manufacturing operations, such as machining, assembly, and inspection, require constraints on the motions of parts or subassemblies of parts [4, 8]. The concept of form-closure is over a century old <ref> [25] </ref> and refers to constraining, despite the application of an external wrench (force and moment), all motions of a rigid object (including infinitesimal motions) by a set of contacts on the object; any motion of an object in form-closure has to violate the rigidity of the contacts. <p> Here we discuss a few different notions on immobility of objects and show how our definition of form closure, which we will use in the rest of this paper, fits in. Several authors have discussed form closure and immobility [3, 11, 24, 26, 27]. Initially Reuleaux <ref> [25] </ref> used the term force closure to describe immobilization (equilibrium) of an object that requires the application of an externally applied wrench. He defined form closure on a body as an equilibrium that is maintained despite the application of any possible externally applied wrench (force and moment). <p> If there is no region that allows for positive (or negative) rotations for every constraint, we have a form closure configuration, otherwise (infinitely small) motions are possible. The method of analysing possible motions in this geometrical (graphical) way was introduced by Reuleaux <ref> [25] </ref> in the case of point-contacts. It should be noted that two (or more) parallel contact normals intersect in a point at infinity. <p> Clearly, this bound is quite high and can possibly be improved. An open question is yet how to determine all possible poses of the polyhedron. It would be nice if there was a graphical representation of possible motions in 3-D similar to the 2-D representation of Reuleaux <ref> [25] </ref>, since this would probably help in finding output-sensitive algorithms. Quality metrics After we have generated a list of all possible form closure configurations for a given part, we would like to rank them according to some quality metric.

This is equivalent to the notion of 1 st order immobility introduced by Rimon and Burdick <ref> [26] </ref>. 2 nd order immobility analysis includes the curvatures of the object and fixel surfaces into the determination of object immobility and therefore leads to other results [10, 26]. <p> This is equivalent to the notion of 1 st order immobility introduced by Rimon and Burdick [26]. 2 nd order immobility analysis includes the curvatures of the object and fixel surfaces into the determination of object immobility and therefore leads to other results <ref> [10, 26] </ref>. <p> of the literature focuses on 1 st order immobility, we will define this as form closure. (So whenever we use the term form closure, we mean 1 st order immobility.) This notion is a sufficient condition for immobility, but not a necessary one as pointed out by Rimon and Burdick <ref> [26] </ref>. When taking into account 2 nd order immobility, it turns out that three contacts suffice to immobilize almost all two-dimensional objects. The three contact normals, however, must intersect in a single point which is usually hard to accomplish in practice.

Reference-contexts: Here we discuss a few different notions on immobility of objects and show how our definition of form closure, which we will use in the rest of this paper, fits in.

Reference-contexts: It is unclear how to generalize the other algorithms in this paper to polygons with curved edges. Three dimensional fixturing Markenscoff et al. showed that for three-dimensional polyhedra, seven frictionless point contacts are necessary and sufficient to fixture the part [19]. In addition Wagner et al. <ref> [28] </ref> proposed a three-dimensional modular fixturing system using seven struts that are mounted to the walls of a rectangular four-sided frame on which mounting-sockets are arranged in a regular grid. They also presented an algorithm that enumerates all fixtures for a polyhedron, whose pose is given.

Reference-contexts: Two edge-contacts are achieved by the use of a so-called angle-fixel, see for example (an adjustable angle-fixel) or connected to each other with a fixed angle. Wallack and Canny <ref> [29] </ref> consider an interesting model of modular fixtures which uses four locators and no clamps; instead, the slack is countered by mounting the part on a split horizontal lattice and allowing the one half to slide horizontally relative to the other. They call such a fixture device a vise. <p> A point-contact-vector on an object in two dimensions can be described by three variables; the position of the contact and its torque. Four point contacts provide form closure if and only if the four associated point-contact-vectors positively span R 3 . This can be verified using matrix computations <ref> [29] </ref> or force-sphere analysis [6]. Markenscoff et al. [19] proved the following Theorem. 9 a 1 a 3 a 4 Theorem 3 [19] For any object O that is not a circle there is a set of four point contacts (possibly at a concave vertex) that provides form closure. <p> By sliding a 1 and a 2 along the horizontal grid line we can put a 3 and p on neighboring vertical grid lines, thereby establising that all contact points lie on grid lines. 2 27 6.1.3 Vise Wallack and Canny <ref> [29] </ref> described an algorithm to compute all form closure configurations using a fixture vise. A vise consists of two modular fixturing tables, of which one can translate horizontally relative to the other table. Locators can be placed at the grid points of both tables. <p> Analysis of their algorithm gives the following theorem. Theorem 17 <ref> [29] </ref> All configurations holding P in form closure on a vise with 28 locator clamp edge-fixel locator. four locators can be computed in time O (n 4 d 4 r 2 ), where r is the largest range of distance between points on two edges. <p> Finally, the size of the edge-fixels never causes a problem (it only shifts the polygon with respect to the grid). For example, the algorithm of Brost and Goldberg [5] thus needs time O (n 5 d 5 ). The time complexity of the vise-algorithm of Wallack and Canny <ref> [29] </ref> (Theorem 17) does not change. <p> Vise with wall Wallack and Canny <ref> [29] </ref> considered a vise with four locators, but what happens if we replace two of the locators by an edge-fixel? We can distinguish three 39 cases. See Figure 32.

Reference-contexts: In the other case, the two locators are both placed on the top table (the moving table). It is an open problem how to compute all form closure configurations in an output-sensitive way in this case. Curved edges Wallack and Canny <ref> [30] </ref> also presented an algorithm to compute form closure configurations on a vise, where the objects to be fixtured are so called generalized polygons. These are two-dimensional objects with a boundary composed of linear edges and circular arcs.
