Abstract: We show that a k fi n diagonal mesh is isomorphic to a n+k 2 fi n+k 2 fi nk 2 in the two directions, which results in a loss of ( nk - Tang and Padubidri [1] analyze the diagonal mesh suggested by Arden, finding non-square diagonal meshes superior to the usual toroidal mesh in a number of respects. In figure 1a, the 5 fi 5 diagonal mesh from their first figure (which is square, and thus not covered by their claims) is drawn. As shown by figure 1b, this network is isomorphic 1 to a standard 5 fi 5 toroidal mesh. A non-square diagonal mesh is not in general isomorphic to a standard toroidal mesh, but instead to a twisted toroidal mesh, a class of network pictured in figure 2.
