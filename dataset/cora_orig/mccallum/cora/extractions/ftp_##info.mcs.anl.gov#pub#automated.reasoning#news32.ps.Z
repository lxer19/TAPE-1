Title: ASSOCIATION FOR AUTOMATED REASONING NEWSLETTER  
Note: From the AAR President, Larry Wos... CADE-13 to Hold Vote on New Bylaws A vote will be held at the 1996 meeting of CADE to determine whether a new set of bylaws should be adopted for CADE. The vote will be by secret ballot. Proposals for Sites for CADE-15 Solicited Alan Bundy, President, CADE Inc.  
Date: 32 March 1996  
Pubnum: No.  
Abstract: This issue begins with three notes about CADE. The first is a reminder that an important vote on the new bylaws will be held at the 1996 meeting. The second note is about the proposed site for CADE-15. The third is a call for nominations for the prestigious Herbrand award, to be presented at CADE-13. Since CADE is one of the leading conferences in automated deduction, I urge AAR members to read each note most carefully. Also included in this issue of the AAR newsletter is an article by one of our frequent contributors, Li Dafa. Using his ANDP system, he has now produced an automated natural deduction proof of the formalization of the so-called halting problem|a problem that has appeared periodically in our newsletter since 1987. A request: I would like to know whether you, as an AAR member, would prefer to "receive" our newsletter on the Web rather than in paper form. Specifically, we would have AAR Newsletter Web pages that would include new articles as they were accepted. We would give hot links to appropriate calls for papers. Please let our editor Gail Pieper (pieper@mcs.anl.gov) know your opinion on this matter. So that the voters can make an informed decision, we have put the proposed bylaws and the existing ones on the World Wide Web. See http://www.cs.albany.edu/nvm/cade.html. CADE Inc. invites proposals to host the 15th Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE-15). CADE-15 will be held in early to mid-summer 1998 in Europe. Proposals are due by July 1, 1996, and a final decision will be made by September 1, 1996. Proposals will be evaluated in relation to a number of site selection criteria, which include suitability of site and facilities, strength of local automated reasoning research, costs, and availability of local sponsorship. Further details are available on request from the CADE Inc. Secretary, Neil Murray (nvm@cs.albany.edu).
