Title: UNDERGRADUATE MATHEMATICS NOW AND THEN  1 Purpose of Study  
Author: Ed Dubinsky, Anthony Ralston, 
Affiliation: Purdue University  SUNY at Buffalo  
Abstract: There are indications that the mathematical profession in the United States is on the threshold of an intense period of reform and renewal of undergraduate mathematics education. There is no question that many people are calling for such a movement. Reports such as (see References at the end for bibliographical information): A Nation At Risk (National Commission on Excellense in Education, 1983), Renewing U.S. Mathematics (National Research Council, 1984, 1990), Toward a Lean and Lively Calculus (Douglas, 1986), Calculus for a New Century (Steen, 1988), Everybody Counts (National Research Council, 1989), A Challenge of Numbers (Madison & Hart, 1990), A Call for Change (Committee on the Mathematical Education of Teachers, 1991), and Moving Beyond Myths (National Research Council, 1991) tell us that undergraduate mathematics is in trouble. For far too many students, the main thing they get from courses in Calculus, Differential Equations, Linear and Abstract Algebra, is a negative attitude towards mathematics. They express this attitude in many ways, for example by reducing or eliminating any contact with our subject. Those that stay, according to these reports, do not appear to learn very much. Ed Moise put it quite succinctly a few years ago when he wrote, For the overwhelming majority of our students, the calculus is not a body of knowledge, but a repertoire of imitative behavior patterns. (Moise, 1984) If we are going to reconsider and perhaps revise the content, teaching methodology and general characteristics of undergraduate mathematics, then it behooves us to begin with a full understanding of the nature of the presently existing program and its history, at least over the last few decades. It is not just that we want to know what happened in order to avoid repetition of errors. It is important to understand what has changed and why. It is also important to assess whether the changes have succeeded or failed as well as whether what has remained unchanged is succeeding or failing. Perhaps most important for the present work is the question of "going back to the good old days." Have we lost our way? Did we once know how to teach undergraduate mathematics, but in recent years, have we turned away from the "path of righteousness" and allowed the educational component of our profession to deteriorate? If so,

Reference-contexts: Thus, even when aspects related to higher level thinking may play a major role in the course and homework they may appear seldom on examinations since such matters are hard to test. On the other hand, it has been argued <ref> (National Research Council, 1990) </ref> that, in the long run, if there is a consistent pattern in the tests given in a course, then that pattern will come to reflect, if not what the faculty is trying to teach, surely what the students will make an effort to learn.
