Title: SmartATMS A Simulator for Air Traffic Management Systems  
Author: Tak-Kuen John Koo, Yi Ma, George J. Pappas and Claire Tomlin 
Keyword: Hybrid Systems, Air Traffic Management Systems, General Applications

Abstract: Air Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) of the future will feature Free Flight, in which aircraft choose their own routes, altitude, and speed, and automated conflict resolution methods in which aircraft will coordinate to resolve conflicts. The resulting distributed control architecture is a hybrid system, with mixed discrete event and continuous time dynamics. SmartATMS is an object oriented modeling and simulation facility which accounts for these hybrid issues and will serve as a uniform modeling framework for the design and evaluation of various ATMS concepts.

Reference-contexts: In view of the above problems and in an effort to meet the challenges of the next century, the aviation community is working towards an innovative concept called Free Flight <ref> [1] </ref>. Free Flight allows pilots to choose their own routes, altitude and speed and essentially gives each aircraft the freedom to self-optimize. The economic benefits of Free Flight are immediate.

Reference-contexts: The existing ATMS modeling tools and simulators have functionality which spans the modeling of runway and airport capacity and operations, through airspace operations and conflict resolution, to human factors and man-machine integration. A detailed study of 27 models is presented in <ref> [2] </ref>, which categorizes the functionality of each model and assesses its strengths and weaknesses. However, the above simulators do not properly address the hybrid issues of the problem.

Reference-contexts: In addition, SmartATMS will be object oriented which will allow the uniform modeling of current and various proposed methodologies and will serve as our main tool for design and evaluation of future ATMS concepts. p. 1 There are essentially two simulation facilities for hy-brid systems: SHIFT <ref> [3, 4, 5] </ref>, developed by the PATH project at U.C.

SHIFT, in addition to simulating hybrid systems, allows the modeling of layered control architectures, coordination of distributed control agents and object oriented simulation.

Reference-contexts: These waypoints are a discretization of trajectories, which have been calculated off-line for different combinations of aircraft kinematics, wind magnitude and direction, and runway configurations. The Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS), developed by NASA <ref> [11] </ref>, is a tool which rpovides such a calculation process. The waypoints from ATC are time-stamped to provide a suggested arrival schedule at the destination airport, which is designed to meet the announced arrival times and reflects conflict resolution and compromises between airline schedules.
