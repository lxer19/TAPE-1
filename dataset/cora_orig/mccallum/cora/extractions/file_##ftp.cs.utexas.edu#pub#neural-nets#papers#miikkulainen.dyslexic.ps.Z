Abstract: DISLEX is an artificial neural network model of the mental lexicon. It was built to test com-putationally whether the lexicon could consist of separate feature maps for the different lexical modalities and the lexical semantics, connected with ordered pathways. In the model, the orthographic, phonological, and semantic feature maps and the associations between them are formed in an unsupervised process, based on cooccurrence of the lexical symbol and its meaning. After the model is organized, various damage to the lexical system can be simulated, resulting in dyslexic and category-specific aphasic impairments similar to those observed in human patients.

Reference-contexts: These mechanisms together give a rough but fairly plausible account of human performance <ref> (as described e.g. by Aitchison 19 1987) </ref>. However, it seems likely that people initially process the constituents of a new form or phrase separately, but after extensive practice the expression becomes a single unanalyzable entry in the lexicon (Stemberger 1985).

Reference-contexts: In some cases, inflectional affixes are processed incorrectly while the stems are preserved (Gleason 1978), in others, the patient has trouble producing appropriate word stems but demonstrates correct inflection of the resulting nonwords <ref> (Caplan et al. 1972) </ref>. Such dissociations cannot be easily explained by the current architecture. In category-specific impairments, the more general terms are often better preserved (Caramazza et al. 1990; Warrington 1975).

Reference-contexts: The orthographic and phonological pathways to semantic representations are very clearly separated in DISLEX. There is some evidence, however, that orthographic access to semantics is at least partially affected by phonology <ref> (Coltheart et al.1988b) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Many observed lexical deficits in acquired aphasia have straightforward explanations in the model. Aphasia is a language-processing disorder that typically results from a well-localized damage to the central nervous system, such as cerebral infarction, brain tumor, or contusion <ref> (Damasio 1981) </ref>. Aphasic impairments may be remarkably category specific. A patient may have selective difficulty or selective preservation of words that belong to a particular syntactic or semantic category.

Reference-contexts: Also, dyslexic and aphasic data suggest that morphology is an independent system that can be selectively impaired or preserved (Caramazza 1988; Coltheart et al. 1988a). In some cases, inflectional affixes are processed incorrectly while the stems are preserved <ref> (Gleason 1978) </ref>, in others, the patient has trouble producing appropriate word stems but demonstrates correct inflection of the resulting nonwords (Caplan et al. 1972). Such dissociations cannot be easily explained by the current architecture.

Reference-contexts: In some cases, categories such as letters, body parts, and colors are selectively preserved <ref> (Goodglass et al. 1986) </ref>. Deficits of this kind can be explained by the topological organization of the semantic memory. The semantic map in DISLEX is hierarchically organized, and reflects both the syntactic and semantic properties of the words.

Reference-contexts: More specific impairments often occur in semantic hierarchies. Some patients have trouble with concrete words, inanimate objects, or indoor objects (Warrington and McCarthy 1983; Warrington and Shallice 1984; Yamadori and Albert 1973), or even with classes as specific as names of fruits and vegetables <ref> (Hart et al. 1985) </ref>. In some cases, categories such as letters, body parts, and colors are selectively preserved (Goodglass et al. 1986). Deficits of this kind can be explained by the topological organization of the semantic memory. <p> In another case, the patient was unable to name fruits and vegetables, although he was able to match their names with pictures, and classify them correctly when their names were presented aurally <ref> (Hart et al. 1985) </ref>. In other words, his semantic memory and verbal input were preserved, but the verbal output function 17 was selectively impaired. The impairment of semantic categories restricted to a single input or output modality can be modeled in DISLEX by damaged pathways between symbol and concept maps.

Reference-contexts: The central assumption, and the most important to verify, is that the symbols and meanings are laid out on maps where different units are selectively sensitive to different words in the data. Indeed, recently it was found that neurons in the hippocampus respond selectively to visually presented words <ref> (Heit et al. 1989) </ref>. It would be important to find out whether these selectivities form a map-like organization. Next, if such maps could be found for the different modalities, it would perhaps be possible to verify that they are connected with ordered pathways.

Reference-contexts: The basic idea of self-organizing feature maps is first briefly reviewed below, followed by a description of the symbol and concept maps in DISLEX and their properties. 6 weights, and the unit output are indicated by gray-scale coding. 4.1 Self-organizing feature maps A 2-D topological feature map <ref> (Kohonen 1989, 1990) </ref> implements a topology-preserving mapping from a high-dimensional input space onto a 2-D output space. The map consists of an array of processing units, each with N weight parameters (figure 4).

Reference-contexts: Another patient could not give definitions for aurally presented names of living things such as "dolphin," although he was able to describe other objects. But when shown a picture of a dolphin, he could name it and give an accurate verbal description of it <ref> (McCarthy and Warrington 1988) </ref>. This suggests that the visual pathway to the semantic memory, the semantic memory itself, and the verbal output were preserved, but the verbal access to the semantic memory had been damaged.

Reference-contexts: Again, each phonological word symbol has a unique representation in the resulting vectors, and similar words have similar representations. 3.2 Concept representations The semantic concept representations stand for distinct meanings in the language. Although it is possible to encode meanings by hand as feature vectors <ref> (see e.g. McClelland and Kawamoto 1986) </ref>, as was done for symbols, it is difficult to decide what the appropriate semantic features should be.

Reference-contexts: The model also predicts that form-specific impairments would be possible in the human lexical system. The orthographic and semantic components of DISLEX were used as the lexicon for the DISCERN subsymbolic story processing system <ref> (Miikkulainen 1993) </ref>. This paper describes the first full implementation of DISLEX, including the phonological modality as well. Below, an overview of DISLEX is first given. <p> Experimental results supporting neural maps vs. distributed and dynamic symbol and meaning representations would also help in verifying the assumptions of the two models. An important computational validation of DISLEX was performed as part of the DISCERN system <ref> (Miikkulainen 1993) </ref>. In DISCERN, subsymbolic neural network models of parsing, generation, episodic memory, and the lexicon are brought together into a large artificial intelligence system that learns to read, paraphrase, and answer questions about script-based stories.

Reference-contexts: With the FGREP-mechanism (Miikkulainen 1993; Miikkulainen and Dyer 1991), it is possible to derive a distributed encoding automatically, based on examples of how the words are used in the language. An FGREP-network is a three-layer backpropagation <ref> (Rumelhart et al. 1986) </ref> network, where part of learning a task is to modify the input representations so that they best support the task.

Reference-contexts: In this process, the activation would gradually settle into a localized response (Sirosh and Miikkulainen 1994). The settling times should correspond to the reaction times observed in humans <ref> (such as those described by e.g. Simpson and Burgess 1985) </ref>. High-frequency words should have shorter reaction times, and these times could be changed with priming. With several equally likely interpretations, settling would generally take longer.

Reference-contexts: The process corresponds to redistribution of synaptic resources, where the synaptic efficacy is proportional to the square root of the resource <ref> (Sirosh and Miikkulainen 1994) </ref>. Initially, the activity patterns on the symbol and semantic maps are large, and associative weights are changed in large areas. As the maps become ordered, the associations become gradually more focused. The final associative connections form a continuous many-to-many mapping between the maps. <p> The selection could also be implemented with lateral inhibition. The units on the map would be connected laterally with inhibitory weights, and the initial activation would propagate through these connections, implementing cooperation and competition between units. In this process, the activation would gradually settle into a localized response <ref> (Sirosh and Miikkulainen 1994) </ref>. The settling times should correspond to the reaction times observed in humans (such as those described by e.g. Simpson and Burgess 1985). High-frequency words should have shorter reaction times, and these times could be changed with priming.

Reference-contexts: However, it seems likely that people initially process the constituents of a new form or phrase separately, but after extensive practice the expression becomes a single unanalyzable entry in the lexicon <ref> (Stemberger 1985) </ref>. How this learning process could be modeled in DISLEX is an open question. Also, dyslexic and aphasic data suggest that morphology is an independent system that can be selectively impaired or preserved (Caramazza 1988; Coltheart et al. 1988a).

Reference-contexts: In some cases, the superordinate categories are accessible when the subordinate categories are not. For example, the patient may be able to classify a canary as a bird, an animal, and a living thing, but could not confirm that it is yellow, small, and a pet <ref> (Warrington 1975) </ref>. Such data suggests that the semantic memory is hierarchically organized, and specific information is more vulnerable than general information.
