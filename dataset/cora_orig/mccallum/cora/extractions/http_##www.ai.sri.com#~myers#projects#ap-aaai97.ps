Title: Abductive Completion of Plan Sketches

Abstract: Most work on AI planning has focused on the development of fully automated methods for generating plans that satisfy user-specified goals. However, users in many domains want the ability to influence the nature of the solutions that are generated. With the objective of fostering increased user participation in the planning process, this paper presents an HTN-based framework for the abductive completion of plan sketches. Within this framework, user-supplied outlines of partial plans (possibly spanning multiple abstraction levels) are interpreted and completed. The processing of plan sketches employs an initial abduc-tive plan recognition phase to formulate candidate sets of intended user goals, followed by a plan refinement stage that generates sketch-compliant final plans for those goals. A prototype sketch-based planner based on this approach has been implemented and applied to a crisis action planning domain.

Reference-contexts: Planning Model We employ a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) model of planning, based loosely on that in <ref> (Erol, Hendler, & Nau 1994) </ref>. The cornerstones of HTN planning are task networks and operator schemas. Informally, a task network is a partially ordered set of tasks (goals and actions) to be achieved, along with conditions on the world state before and after tasks are executed.

Reference-contexts: We note that the evaluation solved a specific high-level goal set, thus excluding costs associated with checking multiple candidate intended goal sets for a sketch (which will generally be required). Related Work The TRAINS system <ref> (Ferguson, Allen, & Miller 1996) </ref> enables users to interactively guide the construction and execution of a plan through a cooperative, mixed-initiative effort. However, users are limited to inserting primitive tasks into a plan, and models of intended user goals are not created to guide plan refinement.

Reference-contexts: Goal minimization identifies minimal subsets (by set inclusion) of the candidate goals that cover all anchors (Kautz 1990). Referential-ity filters the candidate goals based on inclusion in a predefined reference plan that is serves as an ideal solution to the problem at hand <ref> (Gertner & Webber 1996) </ref>. Within the context of interpreting plan sketches, ad ditional biases are possible. In certain situations, the user may explicitly declare his intended goals. For example, a user may inform a travel planning system that he is planning a vacation to Europe.

Reference-contexts: We define the plan refinement structure for a plan (similar to the hierarchical task network for a plan in <ref> (Kambhampati & Hendler 1992) </ref>) to be = hP; N ; Di where P is the set of task networks produced, N is the set of nodes in any of the task networks, and D defines a directed acyclic graph of the refinement relations from a node to each of its descendants.

Reference-contexts: Work on plan recognition has identified several types of bias to select subsets of the candidate goals as the intended goals of the user. Goal minimization identifies minimal subsets (by set inclusion) of the candidate goals that cover all anchors <ref> (Kautz 1990) </ref>. Referential-ity filters the candidate goals based on inclusion in a predefined reference plan that is serves as an ideal solution to the problem at hand (Gertner & Webber 1996). Within the context of interpreting plan sketches, ad ditional biases are possible.

Reference-contexts: Plan sketches constitute one form of user advice. Previously, we developed a theory of strategic advice, which amounts to user recommendations on how to refine individual tasks in an overall planning problem <ref> (Myers 1996b) </ref>. Together, plan sketches and strategic advice enable substantial user-customization of the solutions generated by an automated planning system. Both capabilities are embodied in the Advisable Planner system (Myers 1996c).

Reference-contexts: However, users are limited to inserting primitive tasks into a plan, and models of intended user goals are not created to guide plan refinement. The DITOPS system <ref> (Smith & Lassila 1994) </ref> provides a kind of schedule sketching capability that shares many of the underlying motivations of the work presented here. In DITOPS, users can specify certain components of the overall schedule, with the system filling in the remainder in a consistent manner.

Here, we present a framework for transforming user-supplied plan sketches for a given problem into complete and correct plans that comply with the user's recommendations. We refer to this process as sketch completion.

Reference-contexts: Sketches can be specified as a list of tasks, or created interactively using a graphical plan editing tool. The system has been tested in a legacy application for crisis action planning <ref> (Wilkins & Desimone 1994) </ref>. The domain is reasonably complex, containing 45 operator schemas spread over 7 abstraction levels. The average task abstraction factor is 3.25. Final plans range in size from 15 to 250 nodes, distributed over numerous parallel threads of activity.
