Title: On the Number of Graphs Which Lack Small Cycles

Abstract: We show that 2 fi(n 4=3 ) graphs lack 6-cycles, which answers a long-standing open question. The constant in the exponent is between 0:396850 and 3:266437. There are 2 O(n 1+1=k ) graphs with girth 2k + 1 or 2k + 2; under a widely believed conjecture, these bounds are tight. We also show that at most 2 O(n 5=4 ) graphs lack 8-cycles, and that 2 fi(n 6=5 ) graphs lack 8-cycles and 10-cycles. The proofs color the edges of a graph to increase the number of forbidden monochromatic subgraphs. These edge-colorings are of independent interest.

Reference-contexts: There are graphs with girth 8 and (n 4=3 ) edges, so there are 2 (n 4=3 ) graphs which lack cycles of size 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. (The girth is the size of the smallest cycle.) There are dense graphs with girth 6, 8, and 12 <ref> [4, 5, 10, 1] </ref>, but the existence of dense graphs with other values of girth remains a major open problem. The upper bounds shown here are derived from essentially the same data compression algorithm. The vertex v with smallest degree is removed, and the remaining graph is compressed.

Reference-contexts: In other words, a circuit is a cyclic list of vertices, with edges between vertices adjacent in the list, such that the two vertices adjacent to a given vertex in the list are distinct. These definitions differ from those of Bollobas <ref> [2] </ref> in that we only require adjacent edges to be distinct, rather than all edges. Figure 1 illustrates the minimal graphs which contain an 8-circuit. contains one of these graphs as subgraph. <p> Excluding Fewer Circuit Sizes We've already seen that a graph lacking circuits of size f4; 6; : : : ; 2kg has at most O (n 1+1=k ) edges. Bondy and Simonovits [3] proved that merely forbidding 2k-cycles is enough to get this upper bound. However, the constant 90k <ref> [2] </ref> is fairly large. In this section we prove an upper bound with a much smaller constant, but assuming the absence of more subgraphs. The proof is a cute application of the notions introduced in the previous section.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 10 readily follows from the following Lemma 11, which is also used in Theorem 12 to bound the number of graphs which lack 8-circuits. We remark that Theorem 10 and Lemma 11, aside from constants, are contained in a theorem of Bondy and Simonovits <ref> [3] </ref> bounding the size of a graph lacking 2l-cycles. These constants are nontrivial, but if constants do not concern the reader, then it is possible to proceed to subsection 6.2. Lemma 11 Let G be a graph with minimum degree d 2, having no 8-circuits. <p> The constant in the exponent is about 4:991239238. fl 7.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In 1981 Kleitman and Winston showed that there are 2 fi (n 3=2 ) graphs lacking a 4-cycle, thereby resolving a long-standing question posed by Erd-os. In their writeup <ref> [6] </ref>, they mention that the number of graphs which lack 6-cycles or both 4- and 6-cycles remained unanswered. Here we show that in both cases there are 2 fi (n 4=3 ) such graphs, and that 2 O (n 5=4 ) graphs lack 8-cycles. <p> General Upper Bound This section proves that the number of graphs with girth 7 or 8 is 2 O (n 4=3 ) . This bound follows from a theorem which generalizes Kleitman and Winston's upper bound on the number of graphs lacking 4-cycles <ref> [6] </ref>: Theorem 1 Let F n be the number of graphs on n vertices which lack circuits of size 2k; 2k 2; : : : ; 4. <p> The proof resembles the one given in <ref> [6] </ref>, and uses similar notation. We give a procedure for constructing any graph lacking small circuits (i.e. circuits of size 2k; 2k 2; : : : ; 4) and count the number of choices the procedure can make.
