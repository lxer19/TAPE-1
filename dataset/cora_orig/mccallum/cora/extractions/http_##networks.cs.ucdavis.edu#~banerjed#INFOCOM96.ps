Abstract: We present algorithms for the design of optimal virtual topologies embedded on wide area wavelength-routed optical networks. The physical network architecture employs wavelength-routing switches (WRS) at the routing nodes, which enable the establishment of circuit-switched, all-optical, wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) channels, called lightpaths. Lightpaths may span multiple fiber links without undergoing electronic conversion at intermediate points in the network. The virtual topology consists of a set of such lightpaths, and may be used to carry packet-switched traffic through the network. Traffic packets from any source node to any destination node may traverse multiple lightpaths, undergoing electronic packet switching only at the origin and the termination points of the constituent lightpaths. This architecture allows the virtual topology to be optimized to changing traffic patterns. We present an exact linear programming formulation for the complete virtual topology design, including choice of the constituent lightpaths, routes for these lightpaths, and intensity of packet flows through these lightpaths. The objective function is to minimize the average packet hop distance which is inversely proportional to the total network throughput under balanced flows through the lightpaths. The linear problem formulation can be used to design a balanced network, such that the utilization of both transceivers and wavelengths is maximized, thus reducing cost of the terminal equipment. We analyze the tradeoffs in budgeting of resources (transceivers and switch sizes) in the optical network, and demonstrate how an improperly-designed network may have low utilization of one of these resources. We also use the linear problem formulation to provide a reconfiguration methodology in order to adapt the virtual topology to changing traffic conditions.

Reference-contexts: The amount of pruning (hence, the value of K) required is a function of the size of the problem that can be solved in "reasonable time" by the chosen LP solver. In our experiments, we used the package lpsolve <ref> [1] </ref>, running on an unloaded DEC-Alpha, but were still restricted to using two alternate shortest paths to get reasonable running times. To understand the pruning process, let us consider the NSFNET topology in Fig. 1.
