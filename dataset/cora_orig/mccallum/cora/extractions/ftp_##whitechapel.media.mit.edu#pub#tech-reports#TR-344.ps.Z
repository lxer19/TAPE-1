Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 344 To appear: 1995 IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing Abstract Estimating motion in scenes containing multiple motions remains a difficult problem for computer vision. Here we describe a novel recurrent network architecture which solves this problem by simultaneously estimating motion and segmenting the scene. The network is comprised of locally connected units which carry out simple calculations in parallel. We present simulation results illustrating the successful motion estimation and rapid convergence of the network on real image sequences.

Reference-contexts: The motion expert subnetwork is comprised of K sheets of retinotopically organized units (K represents the maximum number of motions in the scene). Each sheet contains units tuned for a specific velocity at a particular retinal location (cf. <ref> [Bulthoff et al., 1989] </ref>). The distribution of responses of all velocity tuned units at a given location represents the velocity estimate of the motion expert. <p> The exact form of these motion selective units is irrelevant, as long as they represent the local deviation from coherent motion in a given velocity. The calculation can be based on correlation as in <ref> [Bulthoff et al., 1989] </ref> or motion energy as in [Simoncelli et al., 1991]. The input from the motion error to a sheet in the motion experts subnetwork is modulated by a corresponding sheet in the gating subnetwork.

Reference-contexts: The smoothness assumption, however, is not valid when the scene contains multiple motions, and imposing it leads to erroneous motion estimates especially at occlusion boundaries (e.g. <ref> [Horn, 1986] </ref>). One way to modify the smoothness assumption is to estimate motion discon-tinuities via line processes and disable motion smoothing across the line processes [Terzopoulos, 1986, Hutchinson et al., 1988]. <p> In the simulations reported here, we assumed that the sampling is sufficiently dense such that the distribution of unit activity approximates a continuous function. As a measure of motion error we used the gradient constraint (cf. <ref> [Horn, 1986] </ref>): E (i; j; l) = (dx t V l + dt) 2 (9) Where dx; dt denote the temporal and spatial derivatives at location i; j respectively. Note that this expression is quadratic in V l .

Reference-contexts: One way to modify the smoothness assumption is to estimate motion discon-tinuities via line processes and disable motion smoothing across the line processes <ref> [Terzopoulos, 1986, Hutchinson et al., 1988] </ref>. These algorithms are notoriously slow to converge, and more importantly they produce a representation which is ill suited for dealing with scenes containing occlusion, such as a scene showing a cat walking behind a fence.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, the representation we are interested in computing explicitly groups the fragments together [Wang and Adelson, 1994, Darrell and Pentland, 1991, Black and Anandan, 1993]. 2 Architecture Our architecture is based on the "divide and conquer" modularity principle <ref> [Jordan and Jacobs, 1994] </ref>. Rather than have one network estimate motion everywhere, we have multiple motion expert subnetworks competing to explain the data by minimizing motion error. The error signal to these expert subnetworks is controlled by a gating subnetwork which assigns different regions of space to different experts. <p> In their algorithm, the gating units are trained off-line and essentially learn to suppress measurements centered on motion boundaries. The network we have been using is closely related to the EM algorithm for mixture estimation studied by <ref> [Jordan and Jacobs, 1994] </ref>. The main difference is that in their mixture of experts network the experts and the gating networks are assumed to be generalized linear models. This serves to keep the number of parameters estimated significantly smaller than the number of measurements.

Reference-contexts: Due to the ill-posedness of the motion estimation problem, J ij ( k ) will have multiple minima. Therefore a smoothness constraint may be imposed via a larger integration window (as in <ref> [Lucas and Kanade, 1981] </ref>) : J ij ( k ) = l m;n ij k (i; j; l)E (m; n; l) (7) But a large integration window is likely to contain multiple motions.

Reference-contexts: In our current work we are studying ways to improve this integration by having perceptual organization cues, rather than simple local intensity modulate the local interconnections in the gating network. A neural net model which also includes gating of motion energy units has been recently suggested by <ref> [Nowlan and Sejnowski, 1993] </ref>. However, their model, unlike the one presented here, does not compute segmentation or grouping. In their algorithm, the gating units are trained off-line and essentially learn to suppress measurements centered on motion boundaries.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Motion estimation is an ill-posed problem. In other words, local motion measurements are inherently ambiguous. When the scene contains only one smoothly varying motion the ill posedness can be overcome by imposing a smoothness constraint on the solution (e.g. <ref> [Poggio et al., 1985] </ref>). The smoothness assumption, however, is not valid when the scene contains multiple motions, and imposing it leads to erroneous motion estimates especially at occlusion boundaries (e.g. [Horn, 1986]).

Reference-contexts: As can be seen, the network converges rapidly to a correct motion estimate and segmentation. 6 Discussion The energy function in equation 5 is, of course, not the only possible one to use as a cost function for motion estimation and integration. In related work <ref> [Weiss and Adelson, 1994] </ref> we have experimented with other cost functions.
