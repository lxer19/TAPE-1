Reference-contexts: Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) <ref> [2] </ref> provide such a mechanism so vote sources are referred to by their URL. URLs are especially convenient for vote sources as they contain both 44 the address of the information and an access method.

Reference-contexts: We anticipate the success or failure of the system will be affected by many things, including the social interactions between eager and lazy readers <ref> [13] </ref>, the minute details of the user interfaces, and the ways in which filtered articles are presented to users. Still other unanswered questions important to success of a collaborative filtering system are given below.

Reference-contexts: The design of the vote server was heavily influenced by the design of the INN news server by Rich Salz [25] and the reference nntpd implementation by Phil Lapsley and Stan Barber <ref> [15] </ref>. The voted program reuses substantial portions of code from nntpd. The three files associated with the vote server are the grouplist, localvotes, and 49 (voted) which accepts and handles connections from clients and the vote server (vs) which updates and maintains the vote database. nonlocalvotes files.

Reference-contexts: Another example of an information system with these properties is Usenet Net News. The Usenet is a loosely organized network of heterogeneous computers stretching across all 7 continents. These computers communicate via a number of protocols such as uucp <ref> [19] </ref> and TCP/IP data streams. A primary use of the Usenet network is the exchange of Usenet Net News.[28] Net News functions like a huge distributed bulletin board system such that messages created at one site are eventually seen at all sites on Usenet.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, there is a trade off between the desire to allow users to vote anonymously and the desire to prevent ballot-box stuffing. If every vote is transported through the system authenticated with a digital signature <ref> [24] </ref> from the user casting the vote, it is possible to prevent ballot-box stuffing completely as the final consumer of the votes can ensure that each user votes only once.
