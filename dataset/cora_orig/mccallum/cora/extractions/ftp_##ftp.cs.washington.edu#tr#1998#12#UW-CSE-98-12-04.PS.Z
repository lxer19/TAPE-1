Reference-contexts: Due to the small scale of chromosomes, it has been difficult to obtain accurate information on their structure. Many techniques relying on statistical inference of indirect data have been applied to deduce this information. Some examples are in <ref> [Bishop 94] </ref>. 1 2 1 INTRODUCTION Van den Engh and Trask of University of Washington's Molecular Biotechnology department have developed a technique for obtaining estimates of relative DNA sequence positions called fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)[van den Engh 92].

Reference-contexts: The other algorithms are tailored to the particular statistical properties of the distance measurements. 1.2 Work Presented in This Paper 3 One example is the distance geometry algorithm of [Newell 92], based on recombination frequency data. Another example is <ref> [Boehnke 91] </ref>, which investigated branch and bound, simulated annealing, and maximum likelihood algorithms based on data from radiation hybrid mapping. 1.2 Work Presented in This Paper In this work, we chose a sum of squares cost function to evaluate different probe orderings and positions.

Reference-contexts: Given these sources of inaccuracy, any solution to this problem should include a list of the top order-ings deemed most likely. 1.1 Previous Work Brian Pinkerton previously investigated solving this problem using the seriation algorithm of <ref> [Buetow 87] </ref>, and a branch and bound algorithm (personal communication, 6/96). The seriation algorithm, which is a local search algorithm, was only moderately effective. The branch and bound algorithm, using a simple bounding function, was able to solve problems involving up to about 16 probes.

Reference-contexts: In our case, inequalities specify the probe ordering. The problem has been studied extensively. See, for example, <ref> [Goldfarb 93] </ref> for a brief description of quadratic programming and an algorithm to solve it. By using quadratic programming instead of computing a matrix solution for a node P , we would obtain the lowest cost solution to the sum of squares that respects the ordering of P .

Reference-contexts: The " ij are distributed normally. In our domain, the distribution of " ij is determined by Equation 1. Unfortunately, this means the sum of squares formulation violates the last two assumptions. A check in a statistics text such as <ref> [Mood 63] </ref> will reveal the probability distribution of Equation 1 to be the Weibull distribution, violating assumption 4.

Reference-contexts: The procedure of minimizing this cost function is an instance of Multiple Linear Regression using Least Squares. We will use this model to help assess the appropriateness of the cost function formulated in Equation 3. The standard formulation of the Multiple Linear Regression model can be found in <ref> [Myers 1986] </ref> or any introductory statistics text, and is: y p = fi 0 + fi 1 z 1p + fi 2 z 2p + + fi k z kp + " p (p = 1; 2; : : : ; m; m k + 1) (4) where m is the

The C code was not optimized beyond the optimizations described in this work. In particular, the LU decomposition routine was copied without modification from <ref> [Press 92] </ref>. The running times of these algorithms could vary by as much as a small constant factor if optimized.
