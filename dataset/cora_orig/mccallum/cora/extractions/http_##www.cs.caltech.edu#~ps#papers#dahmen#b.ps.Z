Reference-contexts: The possibility of realizing such conditions will be seen to be closely related to the concept of stationary subdivision. Section 3 is devoted to the discussion of several convergence concepts of subdivision schemes which will be discussed and interrelated. Our findings will also extend previous results from <ref> [CDM] </ref> and should be of independent interest. 2 Finitely Generated Shift-Invariant Spaces We will consider here sequences of nested closed subspaces of L 2 (IR s ) which are generated by certain dilates and integer shifts of finitely many scalar-valued functions h 1 ; : : : ; h N 2 <p> That is, G is refinable. In fact, G = sc (cG). The next example extends the important notion of cube spline and is based on some material in <ref> [CDM] </ref>. To this end, suppose that ZZ s is a bounded measurable set of measure one satisfying M = [ m for some set E of representers of ZZ s =M ZZ s . <p> Let h be a nontrivial continuous refinable manifold on . That is, there exist N fi N matrices B e , e 2 E , such that h (M 1 (x + e)) = B T (see <ref> [CDM] </ref>). <p> Then B T e = I, X e ite = 2 ds (1 + e it 1 ) (1 + e it s ): Thus F (jX) is in this case the cube spline <ref> [CDM] </ref>. Aside from the fact that the N fi N matrix-subsymbols A e (z); e 2 E, evaluated at 1 share the same left eigenvector for the common eigenvalue one, stability and linear independence imply further noteworthy properties of A which can be expressed in terms of A e (z). <p> These convergence issues are closely related to the notion of stationary subdivision schemes. An extensive treatment of such schemes is given in <ref> [CDM] </ref>, however, for the special scaling matrix M = 2I and mainly for the scalar case N = 1. In this section we will present some results on stationary subdivision adapted to the present more general setting. <p> Corollary 3.1 If S A;M converges relative to some p-test function then it converges relative to any other p-test function as well. Note that the particular choice g = [0;1] s shows that the convergence concept studied in <ref> [CDM] </ref> agrees with the present one for the special case N = 1, M = I and p = 1. Our next goal is to extend Proposition 2.1 in [CDM] to matrix subdivision schemes. A first step can be formulated as follows. <p> Note that the particular choice g = [0;1] s shows that the convergence concept studied in <ref> [CDM] </ref> agrees with the present one for the special case N = 1, M = I and p = 1.

Then S A;M converges in ` p .

Reference-contexts: In this regard, the concept of biorthogonality seems to offer more flexibility in practical realizations while still preserving many of the advantages of orthonormality. So far, this concept has been carefully studied in the univariate case (see e.g. <ref> [CDF] </ref>). In the multivariate case concrete results have been obtained only for certain special bivariate examples [CS, CD], and since the start of this paper multivariate studies have appeared in [LC, KV].

Reference-contexts: The following observations extend corresponding known facts for the case N = 1 (see e.g. <ref> [CDP] </ref>) Proposition 2.4 Suppose g and h are dual. <p> A possible strategy for dealing with this difficulty can be sketched as follows.

The integer translates of form a tiling of IR s if and only if has measure one, as we will assume now.

Reference-contexts: As in <ref> [M1] </ref> (see specifically the proof of Theorem 2.1) one concludes that 1 (2.9) and, using the fact that M is expanding, it follows that for y satisfying (2.8), the function g := y T h := j=1 has the property that ^g (2ff) = 0; ff 2 ZZ s n f0g: <p> Firstly, the arguments given in <ref> [M1] </ref> for the case M = 2I carry over to the general case expanding scaling matrices M without any change to establish the following results. Proposition 2.2 Suppose h 2 L N 2 is A-refinable and stable. <p> Proposition 2.3 Suppose h 2 L N 2 (IR s ) has compact support, is A-refinable, and has linearly independent integer translates. Then A 0 (z) has full rank for all z 2 (IC n f0g) s . Likewise the arguments in <ref> [M1] </ref> show that, when h 2 L N 2 has compact support, is stable, and A-refinable, then the entries of A ff decay exponentially as jffj tends to infinity. More can be said when the translates of h are linearly independent. <p> C (z) = 1j 1 &lt;&lt;j k ` Then for every z 2 (ICnf0g) s A (z)C (z) = @ 1j 1 &lt;&lt;j k ` 0 1; : : : ; k 1 1 2.5 Multiresolution With the prerequisites from Section 2.5 at hand, one may employ the arguments from <ref> [M1] </ref> to establish the following fact.
