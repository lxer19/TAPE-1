Reference-contexts: The throughput remains near 100% for large packets (512 bytes in this case), even with Q as large as 256, but drops to approximately 1/e (37%) for minimal-length packets. 2.4.2. Almes and Lazowska, 1979 Almes and Lazowska <ref> [1] </ref> continue the analysis of the experimental Ethernet. They present values of response time as a function of G. <p> The unfairness for small N is due to the intrinsic unfairness of the Ethernet backoff algorithm. As Almes and Lazowska <ref> [1] </ref> point out, the longer a host has already been waiting, the longer it is likely to delay before attempting to transmit.

Reference-contexts: This is an important result because a number of theoretical analyses explicitly assume that the network is fair by design (for example, that of Apostolopoulos and Protonotarios <ref> [2] </ref>). Users with real-time applications may find position-dependent unfairness of some unusual Ethernet configurations to be an important effect. 2.4.8. Tasaka, 1986 Tasaka [23] analyzes the effect of buffering on the performance of slotted non-persistent CSMA/CD.

Reference-contexts: This study shows packet rates (for minimal-length packets) of 250 packets per second or less, and throughputs (using large packets) of about 150 Kbytes/second or lower. Although more recent implementations can do better than this, it takes careful design and hard work. For example, Birrell and Nelson <ref> [3] </ref> were able to obtain 1 millisecond round-trip times for null Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) even on a 3 Mbit/second experimental Ethernet. Recently, Van Jacobson has reported achieving 8 Mbits/second using TCP over a standard Ethernet [12].

Reference-contexts: fraction of long packets goes up; this, in turn, increases the average delay for short packets (which are now waiting for long packets to go by, instead of for collisions to be resolved). 1 The ``long'' packets in this study were only 256 bytes long, although the Pup protocol suite <ref> [4] </ref> used on the experimental Ethernet used a 576 byte maximum packet. 6 MEASURED CAPACITY OF AN ETHERNET A large fraction of long packets does allow a somewhat higher total throughput before delays become asymptotically infinite.

Reference-contexts: Further, the delays experienced by the long packets decrease, since fewer total packets are being sent and the amount of time spent resolving collisions is lower. 2.4.4. Bux, 1981 Bux <ref> [5] </ref> attempts a comparative evaluation of a variety of LAN technologies, including bus systems such as Ethernet, and token-ring systems. Such a comparison has value only if the measure used to distinguish the performance of various systems is relevant to actual users. <p> Referring to figure 1, throughput is measured not at the output of the generator or the buffer, but on the network itself. The curves in <ref> [5] </ref> show knees for CSMA/CD at throughputs of 0.4, instead of the knees at offered loads of about 0.75. To the unwary, this distinction may not be obvious. Further, the curves displayed in this study are based on unimodal distributions of packet lengths with means of about 128 bytes.

Reference-contexts: Packet delays are reasonable even for high throughputs so long as packet lengths are at least two orders of magnitude longer than the propagation delay (expressed in bit-times). 2.4.5. Coyle and Liu, 1983 and 1985 Coyle and Liu <ref> [6, 7] </ref> refine the analysis of Tobagi and Hunt [25] by using a somewhat more realistic model; specifically, rather than assuming an infinite number of hosts generating an aggregate stream of packets with a Poisson distribution, this analysis assumes a finite number of hosts each generating new packets with an exponential
