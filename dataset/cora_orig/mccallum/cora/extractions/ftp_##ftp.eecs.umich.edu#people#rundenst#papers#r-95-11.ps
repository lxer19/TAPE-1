Abstract: Recently much work has been done towards extending object-oriented database systems (OODBs) with advanced tools such as view technology, advanced schema evolution support, and role modeling systems. These extensions all require that the underlying database system supports more powerful and flexible modeling constructs than are currently supported by existing OODB systems. In this paper, we identify these features as multiple classification, dynamic reclassification, and dynamic restructuring. We then describe a methodology known as object-slicing that is capable of extending data models to support these required features. We have successfully implemented an object-slicing software layer using the GemStone system, which while still providing full access to all GemStone DBMS functions, now also offers all required modeling features. In this paper, we describe our experimental results evaluating the relative costs and benefits of adopting the object-slicing technique. This includes an analytical assessment of the storage overhead of the object-slicing representation, and its comparison against the conventional representational models. As clustering is critical to optimizing queries on such models, we present the results of using OO7 benchmark test suites evaluating various clustering strategies for the object-slicing model. We find that for certain types of queries (e.g., those that benefit from the superior blocking factor at the local attribute level resulting from clustering object-slices together by class), the object-slicing model outperforms the conventional approach in spite of its storage overhead, while queries involving inherited attributes with low selectivity are better serviced using a conventional object-clustering approach.

Reference-contexts: overhead is ameliorated by an increased object size/decreased schema size (depth of schema) ratio. 6 Evaluation of Object-Slicing Approach Using the OO7 Benchmark In order to determine the base cost of implementing the object-slicing representation paradigm, we have run several test queries from the University of Wisconsin's OO7 benchmark suite <ref> [7] </ref> with the intention of comparing GemStone's native implementation versus our object-slicing extension to GemStone.

GemStone is a Smalltalk-based system, while the four systems compared in the OO7 benchmark paper [7] are all C++ based. Because GemStone thus supports dynamic method resolution, run-time augmentation of the schema with new methods, etc., we did not compare GemStone against other systems, and instead limited our study to comparing "pure" GemStone with MultiView's object-slicing implementation. <p> The "Traversal 1" query tests raw pointer traversal speed with a high degree of locality <ref> [7] </ref>. The query requires a traversal of the assembly hierarchy shown in Figure 8 and performs a depth-first search on each part's graph of atomic parts.

Reference-contexts: To the best of our knowledge, no current OODB system supports all of these features. Furthermore, with the exception of the IRIS functional database system <ref> [8] </ref>, which uses a relational database as storage structure and stores data from one object across many relations, most OODBs represent each database object as a chunk of contiguous storage determined at object creation time. <p> The Iris functional database system is the most well-known exception to this; i.e., it is a functional DBMS system that supports multiple classification. IRIS, being built on top of a relational engine, distributes its data over several relational tables <ref> [8] </ref>, and hence can support multiple states per object. There are, however, several significant differences between our work and IRIS. For one, our object-slicing representation is built on top of a pure object-oriented kernel rather than a relational system. Consequently, our system supports inheritance of both instance variable and methods.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, the flexibility offered by the object-slicing approach naturally lends itself to implementing role systems: object-slicing's implementation objects can easily be adapted to represent the various roles of objects in a role system <ref> [11] </ref>. We examine the object-slicing representation in the context of the University of Michigan's MultiView project, an on-going NSF-funded view management system capable of supporting updatable materialized views and transparent schema evolution. <p> It is to be expected that extending an existing system with object-slicing techniques involves the potential overhead of additional data structures, maintenance costs, and processing time. Although object-slicing is a known technique that is being utilized for view systems [14], schema evolution [22], and role systems <ref> [11] </ref>, to the best of our knowledge no work has been done evaluating the costs of object-slicing. The purpose of this paper is to provide such an evaluation. <p> Thus the underlying view system providing such capacity-augmenting views does require the dynamic restructuring of objects in addition to the features of multiple classification and dynamic reclassification. 3 Role Modeling System Needs. Finally, role modeling approaches have become increasingly popular <ref> [11, 19] </ref>. Role systems strive to increase the flexibility of the model by enabling objects to dynamically change types and class membership. In role modeling systems, objects dynamically gain and lose multiple interfaces (a.k.a. roles) throughout their lifetimes, hence the need for multiple classification. <p> Identified features include multiple classification, dynamic reclassification, and dynamic restructuring. Other researchers have identified the utility of similar flexible modeling constructs. Other view papers that recognize these required features include [28] and [4]. Recently emerging role modeling approaches <ref> [11, 19, 23, 30] </ref> also are concerned with these issues. In role modeling systems, objects dynamically gain and lose multiple interfaces (aka roles) throughout their lifetimes. <p> In some sense, accessing an object through one of its implementation objects is like accessing an object while it is playing one of its roles. The role system proposed by Gottlob et al. was implemented using techniques similar to object-slicing <ref> [11] </ref>. Most other role systems have not been implemented. Unlike many role systems, which allow object hierarchies to exist independently from class hierarchies [29], objects in our model always conform to the existing global class hierarchy. <p> Also, unlike many role systems, in our implementation conceptual objects can be associated with at most one implementation object of a given type <ref> [11] </ref>. Our proposed object-slicing approach is thus a compromise between extremely flexible role models on the one side and rigid class-based data models on the other side. <p> Extending an existing DBMS with object-slicing techniques necessarily involves the overhead of additional data structures, maintenance costs, and processing time. However, although object-slicing is a known technique that is being utilized for view systems [14], schema evolution [22], and role systems <ref> [11] </ref>, to our knowledge no work has been done evaluating the costs of object-slicing. In this paper, we therefore provide an in-depth evaluation of the object-slicing technique. Furthermore, hardly any role systems have been im 26 plemented, and none have been evaluated.

Reference-contexts: In fact, the object representation assumptions underlying most commercial OODB systems, namely, one most-specific type per object, object type determined at object-creation time, fixed typing, and upwards inheritance, conflict with the requirements of such systems. The object-slicing technique <ref> [16] </ref> is one particularly promising approach of extending an existing OODB system to support the identified required features. <p> In object-slicing, a real-world object corresponds to a hierarchy of implementation objects (one for each class whose type the object possesses) linked to a conceptual object (used to represent the object-itself) rather than associating a single implementation with each real-world object, as is commonly assumed in conventional OODB systems <ref> [16] </ref>. This technique of using implementation objects to represent an object's membership in multiple classes is extremely flexible, and provides a solution that extends an OODB system to support all of the advanced modeling capabilities mentioned above. <p> We present detailed comparison studies by benchmark experiments and simulations that confirm this hypothesis in Section 6. * Changing an object from being an instance of one class (C1) to being an instance of another class (C2) is called dynamic classification <ref> [16] </ref>. In the object-slicing approach, when an object is dynamically reclassified to be an instance of the class C2 rather than one of class C1, the object instance takes an implementation object of the class C2 and discards that of the class C1.

This approach provides several advantages over direct modification.

Reference-contexts: The cost of a single object retrieval in GemStone depends upon whether the object being referenced is in the cache. The initial access to an object in a session is similar to a B-Tree lookup. Subsequent accesses are cached to provide increased performance <ref> [27] </ref>. 10 While this storage of references linking conceptual to implementation objects and back could be reduced, we've chosen this representation for reason of efficiency. 13 Size of Implementation Object SR = DS + (5l + 2) pointer size DS + 2 pointer size ; where SR is the size ratio

Recently emerging role modeling approaches [11, 19, 23, 30] also are concerned with these issues. In role modeling systems, objects dynamically gain and lose multiple interfaces (aka roles) throughout their lifetimes.

Reference-contexts: The role system proposed by Gottlob et al. was implemented using techniques similar to object-slicing [11]. Most other role systems have not been implemented. Unlike many role systems, which allow object hierarchies to exist independently from class hierarchies <ref> [29] </ref>, objects in our model always conform to the existing global class hierarchy. Also, unlike many role systems, in our implementation conceptual objects can be associated with at most one implementation object of a given type [11].

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we address this issue. More precisely, we present results from our evaluation of the performance costs incurred by object-slicing, and examine the potential of various clustering techniques to alleviate this cost. Unlike previous work on the clustering and partitioning of OODBs <ref> [32, 33] </ref>, our goals are not to invent new clustering strategies to dynamically adapt to various access patterns. Instead, we are interested in understanding what the innate differences are between the conventional and the object-slicing representation | and whether the flexibility gained comes with an added cost.
