Reference-contexts: Instead of hooking the same computer up to different interfaces, we hook the same interface up to different supporting computers. 7.4 Wide-area network systems There are many research projects underway to explore the architecture of the coming global digital network and its services. The I95 project <ref> [I95] </ref>, underway at MIT, is one of the more large-scale efforts to provide a substrate for general-purpose, wide-spectrum use of the Net: business transactions, entertainment, communication and so forth. Singapore's IT2000 project, based on some of the early I95 work, and the SmartValley project are other efforts in this vein.

Reference-contexts: The Telemedia and Library 2000 efforts will also deliver content for the BodyNet applications to manipulate. An overview of these research projects can be found in the LCS annual progress report <ref> [LCS] </ref>. 14 8.2 The BodyTalk Consortium In order for BodyTalk to be successful, it must be adopted by many diverse manufacturers of digital devices and softwarethe power of BodyTalk comes from its ability to link varied systems. So it is of vital importance that BodyTalk be broad-spectrum and vendor-neutral.

Reference-contexts: There are several related research efforts currently underway, discussed below. 7.1 Ubiquitous computing The notion of having computers scattered into the nooks and crannies of everyday life in a cooperative fashion was stated as early as 1976 <ref> [Newell] </ref>. The well-known Ubiquitous Computing project at Xerox PARC [UbiComp] has undertaken this effort. Aimed at weaving computation into the fabric of our physical world, the Ubiquitous Computing project has focused on three primary interfaces, the so-called Tabs, Pads, and Screens.

Reference-contexts: Demonstration systems 15 and applications will be constructed as test beds for the ideas in BodyTalk and as proofs of concept. 9.1 The InfoSpigot The initial, driving application will be InfoSpigot, a mobile interface to the World Wide Web <ref> [WWW, WWW-Intro] </ref>. This is an interesting application for several reasons: * It involves using the BodyNet as a mobile interface to the general resources of the Net.
