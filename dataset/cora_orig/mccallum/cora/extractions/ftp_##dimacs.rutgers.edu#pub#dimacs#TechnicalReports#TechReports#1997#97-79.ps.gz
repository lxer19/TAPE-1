Reference-contexts: It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the basic terminology of Boolean lattices, universal algebras, and first-order predicate calculus. The familiarity needed is rather minimal and may be acquired by selectively consulting general expository texts such as [13] (Sections 30 and 10), [8] (first three chapters), <ref> [1] </ref> (first three chapters), [5] (Chapters VIII and XI). To appreciate the theoretical and application context of Boolean and pseudo-Boolean functions, [7], [10], [12] may be consulted.

Reference-contexts: The reader can verify that every prime implicant of a function in any one of these classes also belongs to that class (see [6]). The following result is generally known in one form or another. References of interest include [9] and <ref> [2] </ref>. We present a proof for completeness' sake. Proposition 2.2 The class of Horn functions is characterized by f (x)f (xy) _ f (y)f (xy) = f (xy) (10) or, equivalently, by the inequality f (xy) f (x) _ f (y) (11) Proof.

Reference-contexts: A Boolean function is called polar if it has a DNF in which no elementary conjunction contains both negated and non-negated variable occurrences (see <ref> [3] </ref>). Proposition 2.3 Polar functions are characterized by f (x) _ f (y) f (xy) _ f (x _ y) (13) and therefore they can be characterized by an identity. - 8 - Proof.

Reference-contexts: As for the characteristic identity for supermodularity, we content ourselves with the knowledge that we can construct it: the inequality (13) is actually of a more compact form. A Boolean function is called bilinear if it is both Horn and co-Horn (see <ref> [4] </ref> for more). Bilinear functions are obviously characterized by the two identities that characterize respectively Horn functions and co-Horn functions.

Reference-contexts: Replace "negated" by "non-negated" and we have the co-Horn and definite co-Horn classes. The reader can verify that every prime implicant of a function in any one of these classes also belongs to that class (see <ref> [6] </ref>). The following result is generally known in one form or another. References of interest include [9] and [2]. We present a proof for completeness' sake.

Reference-contexts: In the lattice F n , every Boolean function f is the join of its prime implicants. A DNF of f that is expressed as the join of elementary conjunction DNFs of its prime implicants can be obtained using the consensus algorithm (see Quine <ref> [11] </ref>). We assume that the reader is familiar with this algorithm, and with the operation of adjunction of consensus applied to elementary conjunctions or to the Boolean functions they represent (see [11]). <p> the join of elementary conjunction DNFs of its prime implicants can be obtained using the consensus algorithm (see Quine <ref> [11] </ref>). We assume that the reader is familiar with this algorithm, and with the operation of adjunction of consensus applied to elementary conjunctions or to the Boolean functions they represent (see [11]). A set S of Boolean functions in F n represented by elementary conjunctions is the set of prime implicants of some f 2 F n if and only if (i) distinct members of S are incomparable in F n , (ii) S is closed under adjunction of consensus.

Reference-contexts: In this manner a new DNF D 0 is obtained by identification of variables, and r is called the identification map. This operation is a restricted case of the variable contraction operation considered by Wang and Williams <ref> [14] </ref> and Wang [15]. If f 0 is the Boolean function on B n represented by D 0 , then f 0 is a minor of f in the terminology of these authors, and accordingly we shall call f 0 an identification minor of f .
