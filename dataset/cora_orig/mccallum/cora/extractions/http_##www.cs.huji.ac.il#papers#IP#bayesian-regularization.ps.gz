Reference-contexts: The main contribution of this work is the computation of P r (w) (the computation of P r (f=w) is straightforward). A popular method for determining the smoothing parameter is Generalized Cross Validation (GCV) <ref> [ Craven and Whaba, 1979 ] </ref> . The problem with GCV is that the choice of the value of is sometimes very sensitive to the data.

Reference-contexts: Although the space M ; is infinite dimensional, it is possible to reduce Equation 1 to a quotient of two integrals defined on a finite dimensional space <ref> [ Keren and Werman, 1994 ] </ref> , which equals 2 n jA + 2 2 Ij 1 where Y is the data vector and A is a matrix which can be easily computed from the sample points (it does not depend on the data). 3 Computing the Expectation of the Value <p> theorem, by first evaluating it for each f; g pair, and then integrating over all such pairs, weighing each one by its probability conditioned by the data D: E [f (x)=D] = Z Z E [f (x)=D; M ; ]P r (M ; =D)dd which can be shown to equal <ref> [ Keren and Werman, 1994 ] </ref> 4n R 1 p v jA + vIj 1 2 [Y (A + vI) 1 Y t ] 2 dv where H x i are simple polynomial functions in x. <p> No optimization and no selection of an "optimal" parameter are necessary. 4 Experimental Results Next, we demonstrate how the proposed approach results in stable fits. The algorithm was extended to 2D data <ref> [ Keren and Werman, 1994 ] </ref> . In Figure 1, we show the GCV reconstruction for data which consist of a sinusoidal pattern contaminated by Gaussian noise. The data in Figure 2 slightly differs from that of Figure 1 at only one point. <p> We have also demonstrated that the optimal parameters can be found by solving a simple one-dimensional minimization problem <ref> [ Keren and Werman, 1994 ] </ref> . In the future, we plan to demonstrate how the most probable function is computed, and compare it to the pointwise interpolation presented in this work.

Reference-contexts: One goal of this work is to suggest an improvement for the GCV algorithm. Bayesian approaches for choosing the weights are suggested in the pioneering work of Szeliski [ Szeliski, 1989 ] and more recently in <ref> [ MacKay, 1992 ] </ref> . Here we suggest a different approach, namely, computing the probability distribution by directly integrating over the (infinite dimensional) space of all possible interpolants.
