Abstract: Cell delay variation (CDV) is one of the quality of service parameters that can be negotiated between applications and an ATM network. The network should check during connection setup, as part of call admission control, whether it can satisfy the requested CDV of an application. For this comparison, the network should estimate the end-to-end CDV that it can support, by using local information about cell delays and delay variations in switches. An accurate estimation of the end-to-end CDV is important for decreasing call-blocking probability and increasing network utilization. In this article, we will first describe, evaluate, and identify the short-comings of three proposed methods for end-to-end CDV estimation. Then we will present a new method based on Chernoff bound and compare it to the other methods. The Chernoff method is promising since it has good accuracy and applicability under current signalling support for ATM networks.

Reference-contexts: The buffer requirement at the destination is determined by the estimation of the end-to-end CDV. If it is overestimated then the buffers will be unnecessarily large. The buffer requirement is directly proportional to CDV <ref> [AKRS94] </ref>. Also, overestimation causes connections with valid quality of service requirements to be rejected. This is unfair for a connection request that has greater CDV requirement than the actual value but less than the estimated value.

Reference-contexts: The values of these parameters depend on the level of quality of service that an application desires. These parameters are then propagated hop-by-hop towards the destination by using UNI and NNI signalling during connection setup [UNI96] [PNN96] <ref> [BIC94] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Complex algorithms are not desirable, since they may cause an increase in call setup time. Three methods have been proposed for estimating end-to-end CDV: the simple method [TM96], the square-root method [BIC94], and the asymptotic method <ref> [Bor95] </ref>. As shown in section 4, none of these provide a satisfactory solution in terms of correctness, accuracy, feasibility, and simplicity. In this article, we propose a new method based on the Chernoff bound that has a high accuracy, simple implementation, and is feasible to implement under current signalling support. <p> These methods are the simple method [TM96], the square-root method [BIC94], and asymptotic method <ref> [Bor95] </ref>. Simple Method: The simple method estimates the end-to-end CDV as the sum of individual local CDVs along the path from source to destination. <p> The simple method is not a theoretical upper-bound for end-to-end CDV. It is only a heuristic that works for common distributions like normal, gamma etc. <ref> [Bor95] </ref> shows an example CTD pdf, for which the simple accumulation method does not bound the end-to-end CDV. <p> Therefore, the constant to be multiplied by standard deviation may not be the same for all switches. Hence, it is not enough to consider only the variance of delay for an accurate and correct estimate of CDV. Asymptotic Method: The asymptotic method, proposed by <ref> [Bor95] </ref>, uses both mean and variance of cell transfer delay and actual local CDV in each switch to estimate the end-to-end CDV. <p> The end-to-end queueing delay distribution is obtained by the convolution of individual delay distributions. Matlab [Mat94] is used for all the numerical analysis. A similar performance evaluation of these methods is presented in <ref> [Bor95] </ref>, but it is calculated only for a single ff value and only for identical exponential delay distributions. We will extend our comparison also to Erlang (a special case of gamma) distribution in switches. <p> We assume that the scale parameter () is equal to 1 for each switch. The value of and the unit of the delay is irrelevant for comparison purposes, since they will scale both the actual CDV and the estimates, as proved in <ref> [Bor95] </ref>. Therefore, we will not use any unit in our computations and comparisons. The (1 ff) quantile of an exponential distribution, which gives the local CDV, is given by ln (ff)=. The convolution of N exponential distributions is an Erlang distribution. <p> Figure 3-a compares the actual CDV with the simple method estimate. Simple method estimates are much higher than the actual values. Figure 3-b compares square-root estimate with the actual CDV. As also shown in <ref> [Bor95] </ref>, it is interesting to see that the estimate goes below the actual CDV after certain number of hops. This is undesirable, since underestimating the actual CDV may cause violation of quality of service. In figure 3-c, the asymptotic method estimate is compared with the actual CDV.

Reference-contexts: CDV is an important parameter for continuous stream applications like audio and video, which require bounded cell inter-arrival times for a good quality perception by users. An accurate estimation of end-to-end CDV is important for decreasing call-blocking probability and increasing network utilization <ref> [HB95] </ref>. Overestimation is not desirable, since it will increase call-blocking probability and decrease the network utilization. Since accumulation is done as part of signalling, there are also constraints in terms of signalling parameters that can be used for accumulation [UNI96] [BIC94]. <p> This is unfair for a connection request that has greater CDV requirement than the actual value but less than the estimated value. Denying connections with supportable quality of service requirements increases the call blocking probability for the network and decreases the network utilization <ref> [HB95] </ref>, [Wri95]. * CDV accumulation is used at connection setup time as part of the call admission control algorithm and the P-NNI route selection algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The actual end-to-end CDV will be computed by first finding the end-to-end queueing delay distribution, and then taking its (1 ff) quantile. The end-to-end queueing delay distribution is obtained by the convolution of individual delay distributions. Matlab <ref> [Mat94] </ref> is used for all the numerical analysis. A similar performance evaluation of these methods is presented in [Bor95], but it is calculated only for a single ff value and only for identical exponential delay distributions.

Reference-contexts: A similar performance evaluation of these methods is presented in [Bor95], but it is calculated only for a single ff value and only for identical exponential delay distributions. We will extend our comparison also to Erlang (a special case of gamma) distribution in switches. As shown in <ref> [NLG96] </ref> by simulation, the delay and delay variance for CBR traffic exhibits a gamma distribution. Hence, gamma is a good model for delay distributions. We start our evaluation by assuming identical exponential distributions in switches. <p> However, as we argued earlier, estimation of local CDV by direct measurements is a difficult and costly operation, which requires lots of samples to be collected frequently. This makes a model based CDV estimation method, based on a delay distribution model in switches, preferable. <ref> [NLG96] </ref> shows, by simulation study of the CBR traffic, that a gamma distribution adequately models cell delay in an ATM switch. Our method is inspired by this observation and will be based on the assumption that the queueing delay in a switch is gamma distributed. <p> Under practical conditions, where switch loads are not extremely unbalanced, the Chernoff method performs very close to the asymptotic method. The Chernoff method is based on the assumption that the delays are gamma distributed. As shown in <ref> [NLG96] </ref>, this is not an unrealistic assumption.

Reference-contexts: With this assumption, end-to-end CDV can be computed in the same way. Assuming the delays in switches are independent, then the total end-to-end CDV is estimated as: cdv tot (ff) = u t i=1 The square-root method can also accommodate the correlation between the delays in switches <ref> [Noo95] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: the MGF of the end-to-end delay distribution over N hops, denoted with N (s), is the product of the MGFs of the individual delay distributions in the switches: N (s) = i=1 The Chernoff bound gives a bound on the probability distribution of a random variable related to its MGF <ref> [Pap91] </ref>. If X is a random variable with MGF of (s), then the Chernoff bound states that P (X x) is less than or equal to e sx (s), where s is greater than zero.
