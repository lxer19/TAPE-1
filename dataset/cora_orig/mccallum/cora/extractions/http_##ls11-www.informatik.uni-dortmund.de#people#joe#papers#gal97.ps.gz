Reference-contexts: Instead, they try to achieve small angles between the normals of at least two adjacent triangles. For the work described in this paper, a relatively new curvature based criterion, the total absolute curvature criterion (TAC) was used. For a complete definition, the reader is referred to the original work <ref> [1] </ref>. In the following, a simplified definition is given which does not cover all possible situations.

Reference-contexts: For an overview of the paradigms, see e.g. the introducing chapters of <ref> [2] </ref>. Internal Representation Since we already have vertices and edges, surface reconstruction can be easily modeled as a graph problem. Examples for appropriate operators can be found in literature, e.g. [5]. <p> In fact, first experiments (see [6] for details) with the mutation rate decreasing over the time showed a significant speed up of the EA. Since a fixed external schedule introduces a new external parameter that needs to be tuned, self-learning of mutation rates, as investigated in <ref> [2] </ref> seem to be a reasonable extension. Both, SA and EA, do not depend on the quality of the initial configuration, even when started with a triangulation pessimized by a deterministic algorithm with inverted quality criterion.

Reference-contexts: In recent works <ref> [3, 8] </ref>, curvature based criteria were applied to the surface reconstruction problem with some success. In contrast to triangle based criteria, curvature based criteria do not only aggregate properties of single triangles. Instead, they try to achieve small angles between the normals of at least two adjacent triangles.

Reference-contexts: As shown in the original work, this results in a significant improve ment over the widely used Delaunay based algorithms. The only non-deterministic algorithm which has been applied to triangulation is Simulated Annealing (SA) <ref> [4] </ref>. The implementation used by the authors follows mostly the work of Schumaker [7].

Reference-contexts: For an overview of the paradigms, see e.g. the introducing chapters of [2]. Internal Representation Since we already have vertices and edges, surface reconstruction can be easily modeled as a graph problem. Examples for appropriate operators can be found in literature, e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>. Since every triangulation for a given set of points consists of the same number of edges (and triangles, respectively), this representation would not only allow to code each valid triangulation, but also a huge number of invalid graphs.

Reference-contexts: Recombination The natural way to create new triangulations from two parents is to cut both parents into two pieces along the same trajectory, and to perform crossover on the pieces. Since the cut removes edges, a repair operator must be applied to replace the lost edges. In <ref> [6] </ref>, a simple deterministic triangulation strategy was applied to connect the pieces along the cutting line. The problems of repair operators are obvious: Either they are good optimizers by themselves, then it is possible that an EA works even without selection, or they introduce a huge amount of random changes. <p> Of course, the EA requires much more computation time, which may be a problem in real time applications. Compared to the SA, the EA needs more time to produce results of the same quality. A reason for this may be the fixed mutation rates. In fact, first experiments (see <ref> [6] </ref> for details) with the mutation rate decreasing over the time showed a significant speed up of the EA. Since a fixed external schedule introduces a new external parameter that needs to be tuned, self-learning of mutation rates, as investigated in [2] seem to be a reasonable extension.

The only non-deterministic algorithm which has been applied to triangulation is Simulated Annealing (SA) [4]. The implementation used by the authors follows mostly the work of Schumaker <ref> [7] </ref>. The only modification is the use of TAC as quality measure instead of triangle based crite ria. 4 Evolutionary Approach The algorithm presented here bases on Evolutionary Algorithms as a generalization of the basic principles which were developed in the 60s and 70s.
