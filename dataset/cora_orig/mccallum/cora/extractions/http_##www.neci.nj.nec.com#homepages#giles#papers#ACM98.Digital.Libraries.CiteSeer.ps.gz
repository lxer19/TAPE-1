Abstract: We present CiteSeer: an autonomous citation indexing system which indexes academic literature in electronic format (e.g. Postscript files on the Web). CiteSeer understands how to parse citations, identify citations to the same paper in different formats, and identify the context of citations in the body of articles. CiteSeer provides most of the advantages of traditional (manually constructed) citation indexes (e.g. the ISI citation indexes), including: literature retrieval by following citation links (e.g. by providing a list of papers that cite a given paper), the evaluation and ranking of papers, authors, journals, etc. based on the number of citations, and the identification of research trends. CiteSeer has many advantages over traditional citation indexes, including the ability to create more up-to-date databases which are not limited to a preselected set of journals or restricted by journal publication delays, completely autonomous operation with a corresponding reduction in cost, and powerful interactive browsing of the literature using the context of citations. Given a particular paper of interest, CiteSeer can display the context of how the paper is cited in subsequent publications. This context may contain a brief summary of the paper, another author's response to the paper, or subsequent work which builds upon the original article. CiteSeer allows the location of papers by keyword search or by citation links. Papers related to a given paper can be located using common citation information or word vector similarity. CiteSeer will soon be available for public use.

Reference-contexts: For example, author information almost always precedes title information, and publisher almost always is after the title. We also use databases of author names, journal names, etc. which are used to help identify the subfields of the citations. Parsing of natural language citations is difficult <ref> [1] </ref>. However, we have been able to achieve reasonably good results using heuristics to extract certain subfields. Table 1 shows parsing statistics for a sample CiteSeer database which was created from 5093 documents related to neural networks. <p> Breiman, J.H. Friedman, R.A. Olshen, and C.J. Stone.

Much of the significance of CiteSeer derives from the ability to recognize that all of these citations refer to the same article. This ability allows: 1.

CiteSeer can be used to make a more informed estimation of the impact of a given article (citations do not always imply scholarly impact <ref> [2, 4, 9, 12, 17] </ref>, and Cite-Seer helps by making the context of citations easily and quickly browsable). The following sections describe the document acquisition, document parsing, identification of identical citations, and database query/browsing.

We have used the following normalizations: 1. Conversion to lowercase. 2. Removal of hyphens. 3. Removal of citation tags, e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>, [Giles 92] at the begin ning of the citation. 4. Expansion of common abbreviations, e.g. conf. ! conference, proc. ! proceedings. Common abbreviations for the following words are currently expanded: conference, proceedings, international, society, transactions, and technical report. 3 5.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION A citation index <ref> [6] </ref> indexes the links between articles that researchers make when they cite other articles. Citation indexes are very useful for a number of purposes, including literature search, evaluation, and analysis of the academic literature. This paper introduces CiteSeer, which is an automatic citation indexing system. <p> CITATION INDEXING References contained in academic articles are used to give credit to previous work in the literature and provide a link between the citing and cited articles. A citation index <ref> [6] </ref> indexes the citations that an article makes, linking the articles with the cited works. Citation indexes were originally designed mainly for information retrieval [7]. The citation links allow navigating the literature in unique ways. Papers can be located independent of language, and words in the title, keywords or document. <p> Each citation is parsed using heuristics to extract the following fields: title, author, year of publication, page numbers, and citation tag. The citation tag is the information in the citation that is used to cite that article in the body of the document (e.g. <ref> [6] </ref>, [Giles97], Marr 1982). The citation tags are used to find the locations in the document body where the citations are actually made, allowing us to extract the context of these citations. The heuristics used to parse the citations were constructed using an invariants first philosophy.

Reference-contexts: A citation index [6] indexes the citations that an article makes, linking the articles with the cited works. Citation indexes were originally designed mainly for information retrieval <ref> [7] </ref>. The citation links allow navigating the literature in unique ways. Papers can be located independent of language, and words in the title, keywords or document. <p> can be used in many ways, e.g. a) citations can help to find other publications which may be of interest, b) the context of citations in citing publications may be helpful in judging the important contributions of a cited paper and the usefulness of a paper for a given query <ref> [7, 14] </ref>, c) a citation index allows finding out where and how often a particular article is cited in the literature, thus providing an indication of the importance of the article, and d) a citation index can provide detailed analyses of research trends and identify emerging areas of science [8]. <p> The ISI databases are valuable and useful tools. A recurrent criticism against the ISI databases is that they are biased because of the management decisions of ISI, with respect to the selection of the items which are indexed [5]. Other ISI services include Keywords Plus R fl <ref> [7] </ref>, which adds citation information to the indexing of an article, Research Alert R fl, which provides weekly listings of citations related to a set of key references [8], and bibliographic coupling, which allows navigation by locating papers which share one or more references [8]. <p> Identifying Citations to the Same Article Citations to a given article can be made in significantly different ways. For example, the following citations, extracted from neural network publications, are all to the same article: <ref> [7] </ref> L. Breiman, J.H. Friedman, R.A. Olshen, and C.J. Stone. Classification and Regression Trees. Wadsworth, Pacific Grove, California, 1984. 6. L. Breiman, J. Friedman, R. Olshen and C. Stone, Classification and Regression Trees, Wadsworth and Brooks, 1984.
