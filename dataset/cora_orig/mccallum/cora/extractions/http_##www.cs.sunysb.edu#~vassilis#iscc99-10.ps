Abstract: With the advent of distributed computing, application management is driven into a new era. In this work, Application Quality of Service, resource availability at different domains, and user requirements, are combined in a dynamic, synergistic, and geographically broad cooperation. We present an architecture and initial implementation of a middleware that satisfies user requests according to expected requirements, distributes networked resources load beyond the local environment, and respects the logical constraints of different domains. Static characteristics of resources are advertised as service offers using the CORBA Trading Service, while dynamic changes of their state are reported using the CORBA Event Service. We present a model where, unlike traditional high-level 1 management systems, resources compete to satisfy application requirements.

Reference-contexts: Some recent studies present results of dynamic management using CORBA (e.g. [8]). Others provide management rules for specific protocols of the network or other layers (e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>). Recently, Bell Laboratories presented an SNMP-based network management schema using CORBA [7]. These results are very significant and can be combined with the CASM presented here.

Reference-contexts: Once a broker has identified the resources needed to satisfy a request, it uses a signaling protocol to allocate these resources <ref> [16] </ref>. This work differs significantly from our proposed CASM in that its proposed framework is more a service allocator then a management system.

The Naming Service is used as a "glue" between the application, the Node Inspector and the Resource Inspector, so they can access each other by "name" instead of by object reference.
