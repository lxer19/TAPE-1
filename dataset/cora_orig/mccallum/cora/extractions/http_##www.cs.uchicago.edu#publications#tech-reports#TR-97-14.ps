Abstract: Many organizations regularly have to answer questions from their clients. While clients complain that they spend too much time navigating the organization's infrastructure to get answers, the organization's experts feel overwhelmed because they have to answer the same questions repeatedly or they receive questions that are irrelevant or marginal to their expertise. As the organization's body of expertise grows and market competition increases, there is an urgent need to satisfy the clients quickly and use the experts efficiently. To address this need, we have developed an approach to building web-based managers of online textual expertise, called Information Exchange systems. These systems act as intermediaries between the organization's clients and experts. They provide the clients with access to online textual expertise through interactive question-answering. They allow the experts to modify the existing textual expertise and to collaborate on the incoming questions. In this paper, we describe an emerging World Wide Web application, called the Chicago Information Exchange, that manages the online textual expertise of the University of Chicago Computer Science Department and acts as a web-based intermediary between its clients and experts.

Reference-contexts: Then the term's tf idf in a document D is tf log (N=n t ). The second term weight metric used by CIE is condensation clustering <ref> (Bookstein, Klein, & Raita, 1995, 1998) </ref>, which complements tf idf , because, unlike the latter, it takes into account the sequential structure of text.

Reference-contexts: An important question is how the set of topics is structured. Treating the topics as a flat set is conceptually simple, but may have unattractive computational and browsing properties. Imposing a hierarchical structure on it has computational and browsing advantages but may not appeal to some experts sociologically <ref> (Davenport, 1994) </ref>. There are several ways to structure the same topics depending on the question-answering functionality to be supported. In this paper, we consider the case when the experts' Q&A collections are organized into a single-inheritance hierarchy of topics.

Reference-contexts: d i i=1 q 2 P n n The term weight metric used by CIE combines two of the term weight metrics of the vector space model and our term weight metric based on spreading activation in WordNet, a semantic network of English words and phrases built at Princeton University <ref> (Miller, 1995) </ref>. Two metrics of the vector space model The first term weight metric used by the system is commonly referred to as tf idf (Salton and McGill, 1983).

Reference-contexts: Two metrics of the vector space model The first term weight metric used by the system is commonly referred to as tf idf <ref> (Salton and McGill, 1983) </ref>. Let tf be the term frequency (the number of times a term t appears in a document D), N be the total number of documents, and n t the number of documents containing t. <p> To address this problem, we complement Brauen's technique with our technique of negative evidence acquisition. Information retrieval research has generally paid little attention to word structure. The variability in word forms is typically accounted for via the use of stemmers <ref> (Salton & McGill, 1983) </ref>. However, more recent studies show the importance of morphology in improving performance. Krovetz (1993) demonstrates the importance of morphology in a stemmer that resolves lexical ambiguity.
