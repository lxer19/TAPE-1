Title: A Construction of a Cipher From a Single Pseudorandom Permutation  
Author: Shimon Even and Yishay Mansour 
Abstract: We suggest a scheme for a block cipher which uses only one randomly chosen permutation, F . The key, consisting of two blocks, K 1 and K 2 is used in the following way: The message block is XORed with K 1 before applying F , and the outcome is XORed with K 2 , to produce the cryptogram block. We show that the resulting cipher is secure (when the permutation is random or pseudorandom). This removes the need to store, or generate a multitude of permutations.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Shannon defined a random cipher as a collection of randomly chosen permutations, one for each value of the key. Following Shannon, <ref> [1] </ref>, a cipher, C, consists of: 1. A finite set of messages (and cryptograms), M. 2. A finite set of keys, K. 3. Each key 2 K is assigned a permutation : M 7! M. <p> Actually, EFP is the authentication problem. A forgery here mean, intuitively, that the adversary can send messages as though it was one of the parties in the protocol. Let f (n) be a function defined from the positive integers to the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. We say that f (n) is polynomially negligible if for every polynomial p (n) there is an n 0 , such that if n &gt; n 0 then f (n) &lt; 1=p (n). <p> The following theorem, which is a folklore theorem and is given here for the sake of completeness, shows the reduction from EFP to CP holds for any block cipher scheme. 5 Theorem 3.1 Let t : N ! N and * : N ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. If there exists a CP attack which runs in time t (n) and its success probability is *(n), then there is an EFP attack which runs in time t (n) and its success probability is *(n)=t (n).

Reference-contexts: In general, Theorem 4.4 implies a lower bound of 2 n=2 on the cracking problem. Thus for this scheme to be secure, n must be chosen so as to make 2 n=2 steps infeasible. We mention that J. Daemen <ref> [2] </ref> investigated the question whether the bound in Theorem 4.4 is tight.

Reference-contexts: If each of the permutations is chosen randomly, with uniform probability, from the set of all jMj! permutations, then C is called a random cipher. If M = f0; 1g n then C is called a block-cipher. One might view DES <ref> [3] </ref> as an attempt to realize an approximation of a random block-cipher. We propose a block-cipher scheme where only one permutation is randomly chosen and used. This permutation is publicly accessible (as a black-box), and anyone that tries to attack the cipher has access to it.
