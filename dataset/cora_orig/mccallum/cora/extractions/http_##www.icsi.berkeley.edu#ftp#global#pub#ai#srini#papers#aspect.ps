Title: A COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTICS FOR ASPECT DRAFT

Abstract: This report describes a new computational model for modeling the semantics of aspect. The model described suggests an ontology for situations based on a natural logic of processes. Aspect is modeled by an active model, where the semantics of aspect, including possible entailments and inferences can be obtained by inspecting the executing model. This allows the model to provide compact solutions to some well known problems in previous attempts. The report also attempts to demonstrate the sufficiency of the model to model aspectual distinctions made by the world's languages. Finally, the proposed approach seems to have some promise in modeling narrative interpretation. The rest of the report describes the model in detail to justify these claims.

Reference-contexts: The Aspect Marker System. 2. Aspectual Verbs, Adverbs, and Extended Aspect. 3. Lexical Semantics. In this section we will deal with the first two categories. The next two sections deal with Lexical semantics. 2.1 The Aspect Marker System taken from <ref> [Comrie1976] </ref>. Aspect Marker Systems (different languages) mark different subsets of the tree shown. The basic distinctions are described below. * Intra-Situation Vs. <p> So Vendler's classification is clearly problematic. On the other hand, if we suggest that dying is telic, composed of a process and then an event, we should be able to say * Harry was dying, but recovered. Since this is quite a strange sentence for most speakers, <ref> [Comrie1976] </ref> suggests a new class of situations where dying is a special telic predicate, one which does not allow its end-event to be prevented, once the associated process starts. Our model handles this situation quite easily. <p> Figure 11 shows this process. 2. Progressive Aspect corresponds to enabling the process transition of the Aspectual Perspective Net. Languages which have a separate category to express the Progressive aspect make use of this mapping. Figure 12 shows this mapping graphically. 7 The Russian, and Spanish distinctions are from <ref> [Comrie1976] </ref>. 6 IMPERFECTIVE 31 6 IMPERFECTIVE 32 3. Grammatically marked Habitual aspect maps to preferentially selecting the iterate transition. Notice in English, this corresponds to mapping the explicit use of used to. Figure shows the Habitual Perspective in the interpretation of the sentence John used to work here. <p> In Hindi, this corresponds to the form raha. Figure 13 graphically shows this model. 4. Certain languages such as Spanish allow both an imperfective as well as a separate Progressive form (or Habitual) use the appropriate combination of the earlier techniques to denote aspectual perspective. <ref> [Comrie1976] </ref> lists some additional issues with the Habitual and Progressive aspect that are considered below. 6.1 Habitual and Other Aspects Since most situations can be extended over a period of time or iterated sufficiently many times, we would expect most languages to allow for combination of the Habitual with other kinds <p> English does not have a Perfective/Imperfective morphological distinction, but several languages such as Russian, Mandarin, Spanish, etc. do. <ref> [Comrie1976] </ref>. An example from Russian is the use of the prefixes po or pos as in Example 11: On postojal (Perfective) tam cas (He stood there for an hour). Contrast this with the Imperfective Example 12: On stojal tam cas (He stood (was standing) there for an hour). <p> This succinctly explains some of the special cases identified in <ref> [Comrie1976] </ref>,such as the presence of the Perfective Future in Russian, as in Ja ubju tebja (I shall kill you), by simply allowing the reference to the future event of kill in its entirety. [Comrie1976] indicates another test specifically for Russian, that imperfective (such as stoja (stand)) have a future tense that is different from a present tense (Ja stoja (I stand)) and that such verbs can be formed with the auxiliary budu (shall be) as in Ja budu stojat (I shall be standing). <p> This is illustrated in Figure 10. In fact, all the consequent effects of John falling into a hole (location, goal of getting out, etc.) are assumed to hold in the beginning of the reference situations since markings automatically persist in places of the APN. 8.2 Specific Types Of Perfect <ref> [Comrie1976] </ref> lists some specific manifestations of the the Perfect. We now consider these manifestations in detail. The current use of DAPN and RAPN easily model most of the different types of Perfect. In one case, special modeling primitives have to be introduced.

Reference-contexts: It is the active property of the proposed model that allows the model to satisfy the Strong Operationality principle. This property also allows for an elegant solution to the Imperfective Paradox <ref> [Dowty1979] </ref> and other problems. I also claim that the proposed ontology satisfies the conditions for the Naturalness principle. 1.1 Summary In summary, the aspect is an interesting problem for Knowledge Representation and Inference because of the following reasons. 1. <p> For instance John was drawing a circle does not entail that John drew a circle, whereas John was 4 DERIVING VERB CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES FROM THE PRIMITIVES 17 singing entails John sang. This difference leads to the Imperfective Paradox <ref> [Dowty1979] </ref>. We will deal with this in more detail later. Telic situations are therefore distinguished in standard theories as an Activity with a well defined Achievement. Hence telic situations are a combination of a Process followed by an Event which is the culmination of the Process. <p> Non-progressive case, such as in the example John used to sing when the sun set, the APN allows for the automatic inference that the start of the singing followed the sun set, since the start transition would fire only after the sun set. 6.2 The Imperfective Paradox The Imperfective Paradox <ref> [Dowty1979] </ref> comes from trying to separate verbs of accomplishment from verbs of activity. One diagnostic test comes from the different entailments of the two verb classes when used in the Progressive Aspect. Dowty illustrates the problem with the following set of examples 1. John was drawing a circle. 2. <p> next sentence is Tomorrow, I will try three, the APN model will allow the automatic default inference I ran two miles. 9 Note that the situation can always be suspended explicitly with the use of a temporal adverbial like when as we saw earlier. 9 No model proposed earlier (including <ref> [Dowty1979] </ref> or [Moens1988]) handles this kind of inference automatically. 6 IMPERFECTIVE 35 Thus the Imperfective Paradox is solved implicitly without resort to any external primitives such as Inertia Worlds.

Reference-contexts: Most previous work on Aspectual Classification of Predicates [Vendler1967], [Comrie1976],[Dowty1979], <ref> [Moens1988] </ref>, [Bennett1986], [Dorr1993] have used the following classes. 1. States. 2. Punctual Activities. 3. Durative Activities. 4. Accomplishments. 5. Achievements. Though the exact definitions vary across the different proposals, the main distinctions between these classes is made in terms of the following three parameters 1. Telic/Atelic [+t/ -t]. 2. <p> is Tomorrow, I will try three, the APN model will allow the automatic default inference I ran two miles. 9 Note that the situation can always be suspended explicitly with the use of a temporal adverbial like when as we saw earlier. 9 No model proposed earlier (including [Dowty1979] or <ref> [Moens1988] </ref>) handles this kind of inference automatically. 6 IMPERFECTIVE 35 Thus the Imperfective Paradox is solved implicitly without resort to any external primitives such as Inertia Worlds. <p> Also, our solution is part of the model itself, and does not require special type coercion (point to process) as in the case of Moens and Steedman <ref> [Moens1988] </ref>. 7 PERFECTIVE 36 7 Perfective Perfective aspect involves viewing a situation as a single whole, without explicit reference to the individual constituent phases. English does not have a Perfective/Imperfective morphological distinction, but several languages such as Russian, Mandarin, Spanish, etc. do. [Comrie1976].

Vendler <ref> [Vendler1967] </ref> classifies it as an Achievement, which implies a punctual characteristic. But the fact that you can say Harry is dying suggests that the situation is durative and telic. So Vendler's classification is clearly problematic.

Reference-contexts: Stochastic Transitions are associated with an exponentially distributed random variable that expresses the delay between enabling and firing. Due to the memoryless feature of the exponential transition, PN's with stochastic transitions are isomorphic to Markov Chains <ref> [Molloy1982] </ref>. 5 COMPUTATIONAL MODEL 21 3. Hierarchical Transitions correspond to the activation and execution of a subnet. The semantics of a hierarchical transition is such that the hierarchical transition has to wait till the subnet finishes execution and returns control.

Reference-contexts: We will examine these distinctions in greater detail in Section 7. 2.2 Other ways Of Expressing Aspect While most languages have grammatically obligated structures for expressing aspect, there may also be many optional devices used. These techniques generally fall into four main categories <ref> [Berman1994] </ref> These methods include: 1. Morphological marking on the verb such as particles in English (as in eat up, fall down). 2. Verbs of Aspect, such as start, finish, stop, etc. 2 LINGUISTIC THEORY 6 3. Adverbial phrases such as on the verge of, almost, again and again. 4. <p> Iteration as in run and run. The table below illustrates some of the ways of expressing aspects in two different languages, namely in Hindi and English. These categories have been shown to be present in most world languages <ref> [Berman1994] </ref>.
