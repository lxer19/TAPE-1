Abstract: Access to shared data is provided today by distributed file systems and databases. In this paper, we explore certain usage and technological trends that will radically change the way shared data is used in the future. The usage trends include the growing need to access shared data from anywhere, increasing scale, and the increasing importance of efficient search. The technology trends include the advent of portable machines, the availability of software and hardware for using diverse types of data, and the growing diversity of network speeds and capabilities. These trends induce fundamental research problems in the areas of This work has been supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Avionics Lab, Wright Research and Development Center, Aeronautical Systems Division (AFSC), U.S. Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, 45433-6543 under Contract F33615-90-C-1465, ARPA Order No. 7597), the National Science Foundation (PYI Award), and the IBM Corporation (Research Initiation Grant).

Reference-contexts: Diverse network characteristics There is a considerable amount of excitement today about the rapid strides being made in the field of networking. Nationwide networks at 45 Mb/s are a reality, and work is under way to provide gigabit connectivity. Projects such as Autonet [8] at DEC SRC and Nectar <ref> [1] </ref> at CMU are pushing the current limits of performance in local area networking. Continuing progress in the areas of optic fiber materials and interface technology indicates that this trend will continue for a long time to come.

Reference-contexts: Many important applications that use databases exhibit high degrees of concurrent write-sharing and a need for high availability. Considerable work has therefore been done in the areas of concurrency control, fault tolerance and failure recovery. Commercial systems such as Tandem and IBM System/88 <ref> [2] </ref> are able to provide very high availability through a combination of hardware and software techniques. Relational databases have historically been 6 constrained in the kinds of data they can store effectively. Projects such as Postgres and Starburst aim to overcome this limitation by providing mechanisms for extensibility.

Reference-contexts: Distributed file systems, such as AFS [7] and NFS [5], and distributed databases, such as Ingres [9], are examples of present-day distributed data repositories. But although such systems are of great utility and commercial significance, they fall far short of the ideal. Research prototypes such as Coda [6], Echo <ref> [3] </ref>, Starburst [4], and Postgres [10] come closer to the ideal in some respects. However, no system in operation today simultaneously addresses a number of emerging technological and usage trends.
