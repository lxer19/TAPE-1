Abstract: This paper describes a computational model of spatial learning and localization in rodents. The model is based on the suggestion (based on a large body of experimental data) that rodents learn metric spatial representations of their environments by associating sensory inputs with dead-reckoning based position estimates in the hippocampal place cells. Both these sources of information have some uncertainty associated with them because of errors in sensing, range estimation, and path integration. The proposed model incorporates explicit mechanisms for information fusion from uncertain sources. We demonstrate that the proposed model adequately reproduces several key results of behavioral experiments with animals.

Reference-contexts: One of the probabilistic localization approaches for mobile robots is the Kalman filter (KF) (Gelb, 1974) (or some extension or generalization of it). KF allows the robot to build and maintain a stochastic spatial map, propagate sensory and motion uncertainties, and localize in optimal ways <ref> (Ayache and Faugeras, 1987) </ref>. A schematic for a KF is shown in Figure 2. As can be observed from Figures 1 and 2, the computational model of hippocampal function and KF both embody the same predict-observe-match-update principle. <p> The experiments with this model matched closely with the Morris' experiments, but it was not clear how multiple goals can be represented in this framework. Kalman filter-based localization approaches require a sensor model of the environment and often run into problems due to perceptual aliasing <ref> (Ayache and Faugeras, 1987) </ref>. The hip- pocampal model, on the other hand, provides a place-based extension of KF and addresses these problems (Balakrish- nan et al., 1997). A number of robot localization approaches based on cognitive mapping theories have also been developed (Kortenkamp, 1993).

Reference-contexts: In the two decades since the locale hypothesis was first proposed, a number of computational models of hippocam- pal spatial learning have been developed <ref> (Balakrishnan et al., 1997) </ref>. Surprisingly, only a few of these models support metric spatial representations. Furthermore, the few models that are based on the locale hypothesis make an unrealistic assumption that the two information streams, namely, sensory inputs and dead-reckoning, are error-free. <p> Further, KF provides a framework for performing stochastically optimal updates even in the presence of prediction and observation errors. Based on the similarities between the two, we have developed a KF framework for uncertain information fusion in the hippocampal localization model described above <ref> (Balakrishnan et al., 1997) </ref>. In this framework, KF helps the animal in maintaining and updating an estimate of its own position as well as the estimates of the place field centers. <p> If the animal motions are assumed to be linear and the measurement function in Figure 2 is also a linear function of the state, the place field centers and the animal's position estimate can be updated in stochastically optimal ways. For details, refer to <ref> (Balakrishnan et al., 1997) </ref>. Frame Merging We have also developed an extension of the computational model described above that permits the animat to learn separate place maps in different frames and to merge frames together in a well-defined manner.

Reference-contexts: Gerbils were trained to locate a sunflower seed placed in different geometric relationships to a set of visible landmarks. The floor of the arena was such that it prevented the gerbil from spotting the seed until it was very close to the gerbil <ref> (Collett et al., 1986) </ref>. In our simulations, we used a circular arena of radius 10 units. The walls of the arena were assumed to be devoid of any distinguishing sensory stimuli. <p> We simulated a number of experiments conducted by Collett et al. (1986) and by Morris (1981) . It should be pointed out that our animats did not remember goals in terms of independent vectors to individual landmarks, as suggested by <ref> (Collett et al., 1986) </ref>. Instead, places were remembered as independent vectors to landmarks, while the goal was simply remembered as a place.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Animals demonstrate a wide range of complex spatial learning and navigation abilities <ref> (Gallistel, 1990) </ref>. Considerable research effort has been expended in understanding different aspects of these spatial behaviors. These efforts have resulted in a large corpus of experimental data, a number of theories and models of animal spatial learning, and several implementations.

Reference-contexts: Thus, if the hippocampus performs robust spatial localization, it must have adequate mechanisms for handling uncertainty in these information sources. As with animals, mobile robots too have to deal with uncertainties in sensing and action. One of the probabilistic localization approaches for mobile robots is the Kalman filter (KF) <ref> (Gelb, 1974) </ref> (or some extension or generalization of it). KF allows the robot to build and maintain a stochastic spatial map, propagate sensory and motion uncertainties, and localize in optimal ways (Ayache and Faugeras, 1987). A schematic for a KF is shown in Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: The hip- pocampal model, on the other hand, provides a place-based extension of KF and addresses these problems (Balakrish- nan et al., 1997). A number of robot localization approaches based on cognitive mapping theories have also been developed <ref> (Kortenkamp, 1993) </ref>. Although closely related to the hippocampal spatial learning model, they are not formulated to computationally characterize a specific brain region and differ in this regard. A number of neurobiological models of robot navigation have also been developed (Recce and Harris, 1996).
