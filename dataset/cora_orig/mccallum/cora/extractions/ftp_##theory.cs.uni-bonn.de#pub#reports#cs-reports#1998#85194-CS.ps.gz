Abstract: We survey some upper and lower bounds established recently on the sizes of randomized branching programs computing explicit boolean functions. In particular, we display boolean functions on which randomized read-once ordered branching programs are exponentially more powerful than deterministic or nondeterministic read-k-times branching programs for any k = o(n=log n). We investigate further computational power of randomized read-once order branching programs (OBDDs) and their basic manipulation properties for verification of boolean functions and for testing graphs of arithmetic functions.

Reference-contexts: One can also construct an explicit boolean function which is computable by polynomial size randomized OBDD but not computable in polynomial size by any nondeterministic or co-nondeterministic OBDD (cf. <ref> [AKM98] </ref>) 9 Open Problems It remains an important open problem to develop new more powerful lower bound techniques for randomized read-once (and read-k-times) branching programs. A development of new two-way probabilistic communication complexity techniques could be a possible way to accomplish it.

Reference-contexts: In particular, equivalence problem for randomized OBDDs can be reduced to the satisfiability problem. We call a width of a randomized OBDD to be a maximum number of nodes in a layer of a program. The following recent results of Agrawal and Thierauf <ref> [AT97] </ref> relate the computational complexity of the satisfiability problem for randomized OBDDs to their error probability. Theorem 6. ([AT97]) 1. The satisfiability problem for randomized OBDDs is NP-complete. 2. Given a randomized OBDD P with an error probability " &lt; (1=W + 2) for W the width of P .

Reference-contexts: A syntactic read-k-times branching program <ref> [BRS93] </ref> is a branching program with the property that no input variable x i appears more than k times on any 3 path (consistent or not ) in the program. <p> Given a randomized OBDD P with an error probability " &lt; (1=W + 2) for W the width of P . There is a polynomial time algorithm for solving the satisfiability problem for P . 7 Randomized Read-k-Times Branching Pro grams It was observed by Borodin, Razborov and Smolensky <ref> [BRS93] </ref> that there are two different types of read-k-times branching programs, the first, syntactic type 7 where the restriction on readings applies to all paths in the program, and the second, semantic type where the restriction on readings applies only to consistent computational paths. <p> A boolean variant SIP B of SIP can be obtained by a straightforward encoding of ZZ 3 over f0; 1g 2 (see for details [S97a]). Using a modified technique of rectangles of Borodin, Razborov and Smolen sky <ref> [BRS93] </ref>, and combining it with the communication complexity arguments, Sauerhoff [S97a] was able to prove Theorem 7. ([S97a]) The size lower bound on any randomized 3-way (2-way) read-k-times branching program computing SIP (SIP B ) is 2 (n=c k k 3 ) for some constant c. 8 Some Further Results Quite

Reference-contexts: It would be also very interesting to shed some light on computational power of randomized branching with restricted readings of variables and additionally 9 equipped with algebraic branching elements like evaluation of polynomials and branching on the sign (for the corresponding randomized decision tree model see <ref> [GKMS96] </ref>).
