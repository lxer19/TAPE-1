Abstract: Gravity models are a class of log-linear regressions that have been used in studies of traffic flows between geographical zones. Stochastic parameter variations on these models, and their Bayesian analyses via stochastic simulation, are explored here in connection with the development of approaches to studying variability questions in established traffic flow network equilibrium models. In addition to developing methods of statistical inference and prediction specific to gravity models, this paper provides discussion of general concepts of Bayesian modelling and stochastic simulation analysis that will be of wider interest to the transportation community. This report represents research performed under the cross-disciplinary transportation project Measurement, Modeling and Prediction for Infra-structural Systems at the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS) under support of NSF grant DMS-9313013.

Reference-contexts: an equivalent alternative, but one that here leads to more technical complications, is to constrain, say, the geometric mean in this of the a i to be unity, and the same for that of the b j : The aliasing used here is similar to that in the GLIM system <ref> (Baker and Nelder, 1985) </ref>.) All quantities m; a i ; b j and f ij are positive, hence the log-linear representation log (t ij ) = log (m) + log (a i ) + log (b j ) + log (f ij ): Further assume that the interactions depend on available

Reference-contexts: AREA STUDY The Household Travel Survey of the 1990 Chicago Area Transportation Study (Ghislandi et al, 1994) covers a six county region of northeastern Illinois and provides socio-demographic and travel information that forms part of the database used in traffic forecasting and network studies in connection with the Advance project <ref> (Boyce et al, 1992) </ref>. Travel data from this survey are available over a collection of n = 783 zones during various daytime periods, and the example chosen here here is the late afternoon, two hour peak travel period. <p> The impedance factors x ij are here taken as estimated average zone-to-zone travel time based on the Advance network equilibrium model outputs using old CATS OD flow data from earlier work as inputs <ref> (Boyce et al, 1992) </ref>. Figure 2 provides a perspective plot of the values x ij over these selected 50 zones. Figures 3 through 9 provide some summaries of posterior simulations based on the above development.

Reference-contexts: Current software uses routine from Numerical Recipes (Press et al, 1992) At step (5), the univariate density for g is not of a standard form. It may be sampled many ways, the method of preference here being a standard Metropolis/independence chain method <ref> (Muller, 1991) </ref>, for two reasons. First, a simple and excellent normal approximation is available, as described above, to provide `candidate' samples, detailed further below; second, the method is computationally trivial to implement and embed in this iterative chain.
