Reference-contexts: This bipartition is called a split of T induced by the edge e; the split is called non-trivial if both components contain at least 2 leaves. Buneman <ref> [3] </ref> showed that each semilabelled binary tree T is uniquely defined by its non-trivial splits.

Reference-contexts: binary tree T with n leaves can be constructed by asking at most O (n log n) queries of the form: "what is t q ?" for a choice of q that depends on the answers to the queries so far asked (Pearl and Tarsi [7], Kannan, Lawler, and Warnow <ref> [6] </ref>). It would be useful to tell from a set of quartet splits if they are valid quartet splits of any semilabelled binary tree. Unfortunately, this problem is NP-complete (Steel [9]).

Reference-contexts: L T (q) = max e L T (q; e). In <ref> [10] </ref> Steel et al. proved the following extension of the classical result of Colonius and Shultze: Theorem 1 For a semilabelled binary tree T on [n] (n 4), let D (T ) = fq 2 [n] ! Then S (T ) = ft q valid quartet split of T : q <p> In particular, T can be reconstructed from S (T ) in polynomial time. The interesting point in this proposition is that the local quartets fully determine the underlying binary tree. Based on this fact we built a reconstruction method for Cavender-Farris trees (see <ref> [10] </ref>). Our main goal is to strengthen Theorem 1. We need some more definitions. The depth of an edge e in a semilabelled binary tree T is the number of edges on the path from e to the nearest leaf.
