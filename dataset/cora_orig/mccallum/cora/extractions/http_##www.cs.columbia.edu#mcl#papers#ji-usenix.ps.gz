Title: The Design and Implementation of a Mobile Internetworking Architecture  
Author: John Ioannidis Gerald Q. Maguire Jr. 
Affiliation: Columbia University  
Abstract: We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of Mobile*IP, a set of IP-based protocols and mechanisms to support host mobility throughout the Internet. The design requires changes only in the mobile hosts and their special routers; leaves transport and higher protocols unaffected, and requires no changes in the device drivers for individual interfaces. No modifications whatsoever are needed in non-mobile hosts and routers, the system scales well, and has no single points of failure. We have implemented Mobile*IP under Mach 2.6, and the code is readily portable to any version of Unix that uses Berkeley networking code.

Reference-contexts: The mobile hosts belong to this virtual network. In the third option, all Mobile Hosts have addresses in the same logical IP subnet, the Mobile Subnet. This is the so-called `embedded network' approach <ref> [1] </ref>. Routes to the Mobile Subnet are via the Mobile Support Routers; thus, to route to a mobile, it is necessary to first route to the nearest MSR, which will tunnel the datagram to the mobile's MSR, which will subsequently deliver the datagram to the target mobile.

Reference-contexts: The MSR uses the Nonce Address as the remote endpoint to tunnel datagrams back to the popup. Algorithms and Implementation How the nonce address is acquired is not very important; we supply it manually, but a protocol such as DHCP <ref> [3] </ref> should be used.

It is also intended to serve as an guide, in conjunction with [9], to other people wishing to implement Mobile*IP on their platforms. In the remainder of this section, we outline our design goals, and give a summary overview of how our system works. The next Section discusses the rationale behind the particular addressing and routing mechanisms that we chose. <p> MICP is the protocol used to acquire and distribute information about MHs. The various packet types, as referred to later in the document, are PING, BEACON, GREETING, GRACK, GRNACK, FWDPTR, FWDACK, WHO-HAS, IHAVE, OTHERHAS, and POPUP. The exact contents are defined in <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> The exact formats are documented in <ref> [9] </ref>, and their implementation is described later in this paper. In summary, using MICP for discovery and IPIP for tunneling, the MSRs `conspire' to `heal' the partitioned network, and make a collection of heterogeneous network fragments appear to the rest of the network as a seamless subnet. <p> A lot of fine detail, such as packet formats, has not been covered here, as it can be found in the official specification <ref> [9] </ref>. The emphasis was on describing and justifying the major design decisions, and describing the reference implementation and its performance.

Reference-contexts: In summary, it is crucially important for mobile hosts to maintain their IP address as they move, since their IP address is also used as the Endpoint Identifier (EID) <ref> [15] </ref> for connections, and trying to notify transport protocols and applications that the host address has changed was deemed unrealistic. In addition, we did not expect our approach to be adopted if it required ordinary hosts and routers to be modified in order to talk to mobile machines.

Reference-contexts: This is at the expense of having to encapsulate each message in IPIP. The second case is similar to the way ARP <ref> [16] </ref> works. In ARP, when a host needs to map an IP address to a hardware address, it broadcasts an ARP request on the local network, and the host with the requested IP address responds.

Reference-contexts: Two protocols were defined for the purposes of supporting Internet Mobility: The IP-inside-IP Encapsulation protocol (IPIP), and the Mobile Internetworking Control Protocol (MICP). Their numbers, assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority <ref> [19] </ref> are as follows: #define IPPROTO_IPIP 94 #define IPPROTO_MICP 95 Encapsulation is a common technique for delivering data to a remote endpoint through routers that do not know how to route to that endpoint.
