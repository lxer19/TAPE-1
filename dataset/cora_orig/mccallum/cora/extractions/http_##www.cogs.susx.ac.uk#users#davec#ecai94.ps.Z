Title: AI and A-Life: Never Mind The Blocksworld  
Author: Dave Cliff 
Address: Brighton BN1 9QH, U.K.  
Affiliation: School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences, University of Sussex,  
Abstract: This paper discusses the relationship between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Artificial Life (A-Life). A-Life research addresses a wide range of phenomena, some of which have no obvious bearing on AI research. The work most relevant to AI is sufficiently coherent and distinct that it is best referred to by its own name: it is Adaptive Behavior research which is most likely to have significant impact on issues traditionally studied in AI. Some motivations for adaptive behavior research are reviewed, and some of the differences between adaptive behavior and traditional AI are discussed. One significant feature of current adaptive behavior research is a focus on relatively simple and specialised cognitive functions, an approach which invites unfavourable comparisons with the "blocksworld" simplified domains which were popular in AI research of the early 1970's. However, such comparisons usually overlook fundamental differences between the blocksworld-AI and Adaptive Behavior approaches to issues of simplicity and specialisation.

Reference-contexts: No human-built systems are remotely as reliable. . . Thus I see insect level behavior as a noble goal for artificial intelligence practitioners. I believe it is closer to the ultimate right track than are the higher level goals now being pursued. <ref> [5, p.7] </ref> So, perhaps AI should stand for "Artificial Insects" rather than "Artificial Intelligence". Certainly, building or simulating insect-like animats presents a number of very challenging problems, and many of these are problems traditionally studied in AI and Cognitive Science.

Reference-contexts: Almost always, combinatoric explosion caused significant problems, and in several cases this was compounded by the `general' mechanism having hidden or implicit specialisations to the toy domain. At best, so the argument goes, all that was achieved was a collection of ad-hoc solutions to fairytale problems. (See <ref> [15] </ref> for further discussion). Such arguments have a number of problems. <p> The problem with micro-world AI research was not due just to the use of restricted domains. Rather, there were problems in the nature of the restrictions and the claims made for the extensibility of the approach. The nature of the restrictions were problematic because (as Dreyfus <ref> [15] </ref> points out) in several cases researchers assumed that it would be possible to carve out isolated domains, such as a micro-theory of flattery, which would be understandable in isolation from the rest of human existence.

Reference-contexts: that we cannot distinguish the characters on a car registration-plate at a distance of one mile, whereas other animals have sufficient visual resolution to do so; nor can we see the ultraviolet and near-infra-red wavelengths, or detect polarisation orientations, which other animals use to great effect in their visual worlds <ref> [38] </ref>. Once again, it is currently a matter of belief whether successes in simple (i.e. low-complexity) domains will scale up to more complex environments, but empirical answers should be more readily available than they were for AI micro-world studies.

However, it is also essential that the 3 For further details of these and other examples, see e.g. <ref> [26, 32, 40, 31, 12] </ref> and the MIT Press journal Adaptive Behavior. 7 agents have a capability for interoception: that is, the capability to monitor important internal values such as the level of power in their batteries, and levels of damage or mechanical strain, and so on.

Reference-contexts: Nature is full of autonomous agents: we call them animals. However, artificial autonomous agents are much rarer things. Nevertheless they have a name: the word `animat' was coined for them by Stewart Wilson <ref> [42] </ref>. Animats may be real physical things, in which case they are typically autonomous mobile robots, or they may be simulated on a computer, where they go about their business in some `virtual reality'; either way, there are difficult problems to be faced in constructing whole animats.
