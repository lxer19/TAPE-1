Reference-contexts: Thus, it takes only elemental linear algebra to lay out scientific data on a two dimensional display. The challenge for data visualization is to achieve a comparably effective mapping from data to display. Keim [5, 4, 6] has achieved this effect with data from a single attribute. Shneiderman <ref> [1, 2] </ref> has shown that significant productivity gains can be achieved by combining visualization techniques and database queries. Database visualization differs from other types of information visualization due to the arbitrary nature of the data stored in the database.

Reference-contexts: Using this map in both dimensions provides a Karnaugh map DRAFT 2 October 14, 1998-16:17 <ref> [3] </ref> layout and thus, a way to search for patterns of commonality when teamed with an interface that facilitates pivoting of the Boolean dimensions. While we often map a particular value to a planar coordinate, we can also associate certain values to a range of colors.
