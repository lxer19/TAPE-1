Title: Linear Correlation-Based Learning Models Require a Two-Stage Process for the Development of Orientation and Ocular Dominance  
Abstract: In our contribution we demonstrate, that orientation (OR) and ocular dominance (OD) cannot develop simultaneously in linear correlation-based learning (CBL) models, because OR and OD occupy separate domains in parameter space. We then analyse the conditions under which waves of spontaneous activity as have been observed in the developing retina may give rise at least to OR or OD. We find that in linear CBL models there must be subcortical convergence of ON / OFF as well as left eye / right eye pathways. We present a biologically plausible scenario in which the subcortical connectivity patterns resemble a competitive neural network and argue that OR and OD can robustly emerge, if a two-stage developmental process is assumed.

In our contribution we show analytically, why this is the case: OR and OD occupy separate domains in parameter space. As a consequence, linear CBL models require non-linearities like a two-stage process in order to explain the development of orientation and ocular dominance.

Reference-contexts: The retinal input layers segregate completely within the LGN (u 1 = 1; u 2 = u 3 = u 4 = 0) and connectivity within the LGN resembles a competitive network. Similar inhibitory intra-LGN connections between different layers have been found experimentally in the adult cat <ref> [7] </ref>. In this setting the parameter space of intra-LGN connections g i can be analyzed as shown in figure 3.

We now follow the hypothesis that such activity patterns are responsible for the OR and OD development process. In ferrets there is a period in development during which waves of activity travel across the retina [10]. Neighboring retinal ganglion cells within one eye show highly correlated activity but there is so far no evidence for subpopulations of cells which may later become ON- and OFF-neurons (C. Shatz, personal communication). There are no correlations between cells located in the different retinae. <p> To overcome these limitations we have considered a two-stage process. This process is robust but it requires a change in the statistical properties of prenatal retinal activity over time or the sub-cortical convergence of pathways. Given recent experimental results <ref> [10] </ref> both requirements seem plausible. Note After this work was finished we learned that E. Erwin and K. D. Miller independently studied the symmetry assumption for equation (3) and derived the decomposition into four independent modes: E. Erwin and K. D. Miller.
