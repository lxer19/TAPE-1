Abstract: A number of multicast conferencing applications have already been developed for the MBone using the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP). In this paper, we describe rtpmon, a program for displaying control information associated with an RTP session. Rtpmon displays a table-based overview of the control feedback generated by participants in the RTP session. We describe the interface and features of this program.
