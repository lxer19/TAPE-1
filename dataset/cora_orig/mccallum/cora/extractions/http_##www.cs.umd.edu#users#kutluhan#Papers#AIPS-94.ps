Title: UMCP: A Sound and Complete Procedure for Hierarchical Task-Network Planning

Abstract: One big obstacle to understanding the nature of hierarchical task network (htn) planning has been the lack of a clear theoretical framework. In particular, no one has yet presented a clear and concise htn algorithm that is sound and complete. In this paper, we present a formal syntax and semantics for htn planning. Based on this syntax and semantics, we are able to define an algorithm for htn planning and prove it sound and complete.

Reference-contexts: Introduction In AI planning research, planning practice (as embodied in implemented planning systems) tends to run far ahead of the theories that explain the behavior of those planning systems. For example, strips-style planning systems 1 were developed more than twenty years ago <ref> (Fikes et al. 1971) </ref>, and most of the practical work on AI planning systems for the last fifteen years has been based on hierarchical task-network (htn) decomposition (Sacerdoti 1977; Tate 1990; Wilkins 1988a; Wilkins 1988b).

Reference-contexts: Thus, critics provide a general mechanism for detecting interactions early, so as to reduce the amount of backtracking. For a more detailed discussion of the many different ways critic functions have been used, see <ref> (Tate et al. 1990) </ref>. Although the basic idea of htn planning has been around since 1974, the lack of a clear theoretical foundation has made it difficult to explore its properties. 1. Input a planning problem P. 2.
