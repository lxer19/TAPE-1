Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANN), due to their inherent parallelism and potential fault tolerance offer an attractive paradigm for robust and efficient implementations of large modern database and knowledge base systems. This paper explores a neural network model for efficient implementation of a database query system. The application of the proposed model to a high-speed library query system for retrieval of multiple items is based on partial match of the specified query criteria with the stored records. The performance of the ANN realization of the database query module is analyzed and compared with other techniques commonly in current computer systems. The results of this analysis suggest that the proposed ANN design offers an attractive approach for the realization of query modules in large database and knowledge base systems, especially for retrieval based on partial matches. fl This research was partially supported by the National Science Foundation through the grant IRI-9409580 to Vasant Honavar. A preliminary version of this paper [Chen and Honavar, 1995c] appears in the Proceedings of the 1995 World Congress on Neural Networks.

Reference-contexts: The development of specialized hardware for implementation of ANNs is still in its early stages. Conventional CMOS technology that is currently the main technology for VLSI implementation of ANN is known to be slow (kumar, 1994; Lu & Samuleli, 1993). Other technologies, such as BiCMOS, NCMOS <ref> (kumar, 1994) </ref>, pseudo-NMOS logic, standard N-P domino logic, and quasi N-P domino logic (Lu & Samuleli, 1993), may provide better performance for the realization of ANNs.

The cost-effective access time with current disk systems appears to be around 10 ms. In comparison, the proposed ANN-based implementation is clearly far superior when speed of access is the prime consideration.
