Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the contractors strategic decision problem of what payment to offer to maximize its expected utility, and propose a method for a self-interested contractor to determine the best payment to offer. We present a fourstep decision-making mechanism using a stochastic Markov-process (MP) model, which captures various factors that influence the utility value and uncertainties associated with them. The MP-based mechanism enables a contractor to choose different optimal payments depending on the payment(s) of the other contractor(s) or the contractees costs of doing the task, and therefore to receive a better profit. The experiment demonstrates strategic thinkingthinking about not only oneself but also the contractees and the other competing contractorsis indeed advantageous.

Reference-contexts: . .0 0 In Markov process theory, the matrix (I Q) -1 is called the fundamental matrix, M, and the (i,j)-th element of the fundamental matrix, m ij , means the average number of visits to transient state j starting from state i before the process enters any absorbing state <ref> (Bhat 1972) </ref>. The fundamental matrix is very important, since it is used when computing the probabilities and payoffs of S and F as follows. First, let f i j be the probability that the process starting in transient state i ends up in absorbing state j.

Reference-contexts: Step 4: Finding the optimal payment When the probabilities and payoffs of S and F are ready, finding the best payment is an optimization problem <ref> (Gill, Murray & Wright 1981) </ref>. At present, we use a simple generate-and-test: we generate the utility values for various values of r, and choose the r with the highest expected utility. We are currently investigating an appropriate optimization technique for Step 4.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, an agent may want to think about what the others think about what it thinks about and so on <ref> (Gmytrasiewicz, Durfee & Wehe 1991) </ref>. Or, it may model the contracting situation probabilistically, as done in decision analysis (Raiffa 1968). 1 Assuming no counteroffer from the contractee side.

Reference-contexts: Due to space limitations, we do not describe how the contractor computes the probabilities of (1), (2), and (3), and therefore the probability of retraction. The detailed explanation can be found in <ref> (Park, Durfee & Birmingham 1996) </ref>. Step 3: Computing the probabilities and payoffs of success and failure Having the MP model and its transition probabilities, the contractor can compute the probabilities and payoffs of S and F. Before continuing, lets define the transition probability matrix and the fundamental matrix.

Reference-contexts: See (Rosenschein & Zlotkin 1994; Varian 1995) for global mechanism design for self-interested agents. In terms of local decision-making, an agent with strategic thinking may get a higher payoff even in a task-oriented domain <ref> (Rosenschein & Zlotkin 1994) </ref> or even in a competitive market with large numbers of agents (Varian 1993). Therefore, an agent may want to think about what the others think about what it thinks about and so on (Gmytrasiewicz, Durfee & Wehe 1991).

Reference-contexts: The contracting situation we are interested in consists of multiple, concurrent contracts, which demands a local decision-making mechanism that explicitly reasons about concurrent contracts and possible retractions, but there has been little research on such cases. Although Sandholm <ref> (Sandholm 1993) </ref> proposes a contracting strategy under multiple contracts, his agents do not capitalize on the opponents costs or the impact of other contracts competing in the system. <p> The contractor does not care about whether T 2 is retracted as long as T 1 is successfully finished. 3 As noted in <ref> (Sandholm 1993) </ref> , the aggressive contractee is an approximation when there are many contractees. Note that states 10, 6, and 5 will not be reached from the initial states; they are drawn for completeness. If a new task is introduced during the contracting process, however, those states can be reached.

Reference-contexts: Although Sandholm (Sandholm 1993) proposes a contracting strategy under multiple contracts, his agents do not capitalize on the opponents costs or the impact of other contracts competing in the system. Recently, he proposes a leveled commitment protocol that allows agents to retract from a contract by paying a penalty <ref> (Sandholm & Lesser 1995b) </ref>, but an agents decision-making mechanism for such cases has not yet been developed. 3 The Contractors Decision Problem We assume the agents use a simple contracting protocol called Take-It-or-Leave-It (TILI).

Reference-contexts: And the payoff of the MP_TPA stays stable no matter which contractor it competes with. We account for this by the TILI protocol we are using, which leaves little choice to the contractees in improving their payoffs. As noted in <ref> (Varian 1995) </ref>, the TILI protocol is better for maximizing the contractors revenue when the margin between the values and the contractee costs is higher.
