Abstract: Recent generation of FPGAs take advantage of speed and density benefits resulted from heterogeneous FPGAs, which provide either an array of homogeneous programmable logic blocks (PLBs), each configured to implement circuits with lookup tables (LUTs) of different sizes, or an array of physically heterogeneous LUTs. LUTs with different sizes usually have different delays. This paper presents the first polynomial-time optimal technology mapping algorithm, named HeteroMap, for delay minimization in heterogeneous FPGA designs. For a heterogeneous FPGA consisting of K 1 -LUTs, K 2 -LUTs, . . . , and K c -LUTs, HeteroMap computes the minimum delay mapping solution in O( time for a circuit netlist with n gates and m edges. The Het-eroMap algorithm generates favorable results for Xilinx XC4000 series FPGAs and Lucent ORCA2C series FPGAs. Furthermore, the optimality of the HeteroMap algorithm enables us to quantitatively evaluate various heterogeneous architectures without the bias of mapping heuristics.

Reference-contexts: For a circuit mapped into a heterogeneous FPGA, we assume different access delays for heterogeneous LUTs but a constant delay for the interconnection 1 , which we call heterogeneous LUT-delay model. The unit-delay model used in <ref> [2] </ref> is a special case of heterogeneous LUT-delay model in homogeneous FPGAs. <p> We can then perform a binary search over H t list (i) to determin H t (i) and hence l i (t) = H t (i) + d i . To compute a K-feasible cut of height H in N t , we apply the approach proposed in <ref> [2] </ref>. Lemma 4 A minimum height K i -feasible cut in N t under heterogeneous LUT-delay model can be found in O (K i m log jN t j) time where m is the number of edges in N t . <p> N with n nodes and m edges, the labeling process can be done in O ( P c i=1 K i n m log n) time. 3.2 Mapping Phase The mapping phase of the HeteroMap algorithm generates the LUTs in the optimal solution in a similar way as that in <ref> [2] </ref>, exept that the LUTs generated in our mapping solution can be heterogeneous. The entire second phase takes linear time. 3.3 Area Minimization in the HeteroMap Algorithm The secondary objective of our technology mapping algorithm is area optimization, which is considered by maxmizing the volume of each cut [2] and by <p> that in <ref> [2] </ref>, exept that the LUTs generated in our mapping solution can be heterogeneous. The entire second phase takes linear time. 3.3 Area Minimization in the HeteroMap Algorithm The secondary objective of our technology mapping algorithm is area optimization, which is considered by maxmizing the volume of each cut [2] and by the post-mapping heterogeneous predecessor packing operations, extended from the predecessor packing technique proposed in [1] to the heterogeneous mapping solution. 4 Experimental Results and Comparative Study 4.1 Mapping Comparison on Heterogeneous FPGAs We first compare FlowMap [2] and HeteroMap on XC4000 series FPGAs, which can implement circuits with <p> optimization, which is considered by maxmizing the volume of each cut <ref> [2] </ref> and by the post-mapping heterogeneous predecessor packing operations, extended from the predecessor packing technique proposed in [1] to the heterogeneous mapping solution. 4 Experimental Results and Comparative Study 4.1 Mapping Comparison on Heterogeneous FPGAs We first compare FlowMap [2] and HeteroMap on XC4000 series FPGAs, which can implement circuits with 4-LUTs and 5-LUTs of delay 1 and 1:5 2 . Match4K [3] is an intelligent post-mapping multi-step matching heuristic for XC4000 devices to reduce the PLB number.

Reference-contexts: For example, each PLB in XC4000 series FPGAs <ref> [10] </ref> can be configured to implement either two seperate 4-LUTs or a single 5-LUT, while each PLB in ORCA2C series FPGAs can be configured to implement either two seperate 5-LUTs or a single 6-LUT. <p> For FlowMap, we set K = 5. Table 1 shows that HeteroMap reduces 19% of the mapping delays (M-Dly) and 7% of the post-layout delays (PL-D) with only 2% increase on the PLB numbers over FlowMap. 2 This delay ratio is derived from <ref> [10] </ref>.
