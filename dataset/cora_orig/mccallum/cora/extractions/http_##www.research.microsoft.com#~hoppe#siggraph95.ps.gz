Abstract: In computer graphics and geometric modeling, shapes are often represented by triangular meshes. With the advent of laser scanning systems, meshes of extreme complexity are rapidly becoming commonplace. Such meshes are notoriously expensive to store, transmit, render, and are awkward to edit. Multiresolution analysis offers a simple, unified, and theoretically sound approach to dealing with these problems. Lounsbery et al. have recently developed a technique for creating multiresolution representations for a restricted class of meshes with subdivision connectivity. Unfortunately, meshes encountered in practice typically do not meet this requirement. In this paper we present a method for overcoming the subdivision connectivity restriction, meaning that completely arbitrary meshes can now be converted to multiresolution form. The method is based on the approximation of an arbitrary initial mesh M by a mesh M J that has subdivision connectivity and is guaranteed to be within a specified tolerance. The key ingredient of our algorithm is the construction of a parametrization of M over a simple domain. We expect this parametrization to be of use in other contexts, such as texture mapping or the approximation of complex meshes by NURBS patches.

Reference-contexts: The distance between two faces is defined as length of the shortest path in this dual graph. Constructing the Voronoi diagram is a multi-source shortest path problem in the dual graph, which we solve using a variant of Di-jkstra's algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>. The algorithm simultaneously grows the Voronoi tiles from their site faces until they cover M. Selecting the site faces In this section we describe an algorithm for selecting a set S of site faces such that the induced Voronoi diagram, computed as above, is dual to a triangulation.

P that agrees with g on the boundary of D and minimizes metric dispersion (see Eells and Sampson [3], pages 114-115, and the survey article by Eells and Lemaire <ref> [2] </ref>). Metric dispersion is a measure of the extent to which a map stretches regions of small diameter in D. It is thus a measure of metric distortion.

Reference-contexts: For the remainder of this paper we refer to the unique piecewise linear function minimizing (1) as a harmonic map, although strictly speaking it is only an approximation. Others have developed similar approaches to embedding disk like regions. One such approach, described by Kent et al. <ref> [9] </ref>, is also based on minimizing the energy of a network of springs. They choose spring constants to be either all equal or inversely proportional to edge lengths. <p> The L error for a given value of J can therefore easily be determined by evaluating E (x) at the vertices of J . Using a local marching technique such as the one in Kent et al. <ref> [9] </ref>, these vertices can be found in time proportional to the total number of vertices in and K J . 8 Results Color Plates 1 and 2 illustrate the steps of the algorithm and present examples of its applications.

Reference-contexts: The main advantage of our method is its ability to deal with shapes of arbitrary topological type. The problem of parametrizing meshes has recently been con sidered by Maillot et al. <ref> [12] </ref> in the context of texture mapping. However, the parametrizations they construct are not useful for our purpose: their surface tiles are not triangular, and their local parametrizations do not fit together continuously. <p> Others have developed similar approaches to embedding disk like regions. One such approach, described by Kent et al. [9], is also based on minimizing the energy of a network of springs. They choose spring constants to be either all equal or inversely proportional to edge lengths. Maillot et al. <ref> [12] </ref> introduced another functional, also based on elasticity theory. schemes in a simple example where the region D (see Figure 3 (a)) is a triangulation of a planar polygon P and g : @D ! P . is the identity.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, finding the shortest paths between two points on a mesh is itself a difficult problem <ref> [14] </ref>. Our alternative uses harmonic maps twice: once to produce an initial Delaunay triangulation, and then again to improve the triangulation by straightening its edges.

Reference-contexts: It is thus a measure of metric distortion. In addition to minimizing metric distortion, the harmonic map h has a number of important properties: (i) It is infinitely differentiable on each face of D; (ii) it is an embedding <ref> [17] </ref>; and (iii) it is independent of the triangulation of D. Because h : D ! P is an embedding, the inverse h 1 is a parametrization of D over P. We will return below to the issues of choosing the boundary map g and of computing approximations to h.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, our local parametrizations, based on the well-established theory of harmonic maps, are simpler to compute than the ones used by Maillot et al., and seem to produce parametrizations of comparable quality (see Section 4). Finally, the technique of Schr oder and Sweldens <ref> [18] </ref> could be used in place of Lounsbery et al. for multiresolution analysis of the remesh. 3 Overview of Remeshing The basic idea of remeshing is to construct a parametrization of M over a suitably determined domain mesh K 0 .
