Abstract: We study a routing problem which occurs in high-speed (ATM) networks, termed the "rooted virtual path layout problem" on chain networks. This problem is essentially a tree embedding problem on a chain host graph. We present four performance measures for the quality of such an embedding which have practical implications, and find optimal solutions for each of them. We first show that the search can be restricted to the class of layouts with no crossovers. Given bounds on the load ` and number of hops h in a layout, we then present a family of ordered trees T (`; h), within which an optimal solution can be found (if one exists at all); this holds for either the worst-case or average-case measures, and for a chain of length n, with n

Reference-contexts: Each VC is a simple path in this virtual network. The VP layout must satisfy certain conditions to guarantee important performance aspects of the network (see <ref> [ATTD94, GZ94] </ref> for technical justification of the model for ATM networks). In particular, there are restrictions on the following parameters: The load: The number of virtual edges that share any physical edge. <p> This restricted problem for the ATM VP layout problem is termed the rooted (or one-to-many) VPL problem [GZ94] and is the focus of the present work. 1.2 Related Work A few works have tackled the VP layout problem, some using empirical techniques <ref> [ATTD94, LC93] </ref>, and some using theoretical analysis [GZ94, CGZ94]; However, none of these works has attempted to combinatorially characterize the optimal solution, and achieve a tight upper bound for the problem.

Reference-contexts: The main difference stems from the fact that in our case there is no flexibility as to the routing scheme itself since it is determined by the ATM standard [ITU90]. A related criterion, minimizing the number of VPs to achieve a required maximal hop count, is discussed in <ref> [BTS94] </ref> mainly for database optimization purposes, and yields very different 2 results. For ATM, however, this criterion is of lesser importance since no such global constraint exists. The notion of forwarding index was studied for communication networks (see, e.g., [CCRS87, HMS89]).

As the ATM standard [ITU90] limits the maximum size of VP routing tables to 4096 entries, this resource is critical in networks with a few hundreds of nodes (see [Ger95] for a justification).

Reference-contexts: Of particular practical interest is the weighted hop count measure, since it determines the expected time for setting up a connection between a pair of users, given the relative frequency of connection requests between network vertices. A similar problem was empirically handled in <ref> [GS95] </ref>. To the best of our knowledge, the present work is the first to analytically tackle this problem. The VP layout problem is closely related to graph-embedding problems since in both cases it is required to embed one graph in another graph.
