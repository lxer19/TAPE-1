Title: Towards a Society of Affect-driven Agents

Abstract: We describe a hybrid agent architecture capable of simulating emotional behaviour. Agents have certain fixed personality traits, which influence emotion levels as well as relationships with other agents. Changes in emotions are modelled through propagation in an emotion network. We extend a standard action representation to include emotional preconditions and effects. Results from a test-bed environment with two sample scenarios show how differences in environmental factors and personality affect the social behaviour and emotions of the agents in a group over time.

Reference-contexts: Each directed link from node E i to node E j has a (positive or negative) weight, W i;j , that represents the influence of emotion i on emotion j. We use a form of activation with decay <ref> (Anderson, 1983) </ref>, spreading from the emotion which has changed, E i (T j ), to propagate emotional change.

Reference-contexts: In the future, we envisage a more general way of incorporating relationships in the action-selection process, e.g., by having relationship levels affect the probability of choosing actions. Unlike the research described in <ref> (Bates et al., 1992) </ref>, where agents simply have attitudes towards objects (whether physical or other agents), our explicit model of relationships between agents will allow more complex relationship models, e.g., the relationship of an agent A with another agent B may be influenced by their relationships with other agents. <p> Both the main five personality factors and the emotion categories could be extended to more detailed sub-categories, e.g., anxiety or concern rather than fear (as done in <ref> (Bates et al., 1992) </ref>). However, the advantages from the resultant additional distinctions in agent behaviour must be weighed against the increase in computational complexity. At present, agents have a simple model for the effect of emotions on plan generation and execution.

Reference-contexts: Goals of maintenance based on emotional needs (x Emotion Module) are given a lower priority than physiological goals. Execution Module. This module is given a plan to be executed. This plan may be interrupted by situations that require an immediate response (this is a form of Brooks' subsumption architecture <ref> (Brooks, 1986) </ref>), e.g., an agent being scared and having to run away. In this case, our simple agents replace the current plan with the action (s) that address the more urgent need.

Reference-contexts: Personality Module. Each agent has a set of personality attributes. We have chosen to represent these attributes by means of the Big-Five Factor Structure, namely introversion/extroversion, pleasantness or agreeableness, conscientiousness or dependability, emotional stability, and intellect or sophistication <ref> (Goldberg, 1990) </ref>. Numerical values for these factors are in the [0,1] range, with 0.5 representing normal. Emotion Module Emotion Model. The emotion model is based on that proposed in (Nicholson and Dutta, 1997). We model a number of emotion categories (Goleman, 1996), e.g., fear, happiness, sadness, anger and love.

The emotion model is based on that proposed in (Nicholson and Dutta, 1997). We model a number of emotion categories <ref> (Goleman, 1996) </ref>, e.g., fear, happiness, sadness, anger and love. The value for each category is in the [0,1] range. For each emotion, an agent has a desired emotion value, E DES , which may be considered a goal of maintenance, and a default emotion value, E DEF .

Reference-contexts: We call these E-Preconditions, to distinguish them from ordinary physical preconditions, which we call P-Preconditions. The E-preconditions are satisfied when the level of an emotion exceeds a particular threshold (this is similar to the stimulus conditions described in <ref> (Green and Carberry, 1992) </ref>). This causes an action to become a candidate to be considered by the planner. The run-away (x) action illustrates these preconditions; the P-precondition is that the agent is at location x, while the E-precondition is that the agent's fear exceeds the threshold value 0.7.

Reference-contexts: With this configuration we vary what we call the environmental influence by increasing the values for fear and anger at each time step (simulating negative external events). This constitutes a crude implementation of results from <ref> (Lepore et al., 1991) </ref>, whereby some chronic environmental stressors (e.g., crowding) may increase the impact of social stressors. 4 In Figure 6 we see that as the negative environmental influences increase, the agents choose more emotionally charged speech-acts; the incidence of reject, insult, scream and share-feeling increases, while the incidence of

Reference-contexts: Reactive behaviour occurs when extreme emotions trigger an overriding action. Much of the recent work on social agents focuses on the development of individual believable agents for interaction with human users (Loyall and Bates, 1997; Webber and Badler, 1995; Rich et al., 1994) or for completing domain-specific tasks <ref> (Martin and Firby, 1991) </ref>. In contrast, the focus of this paper is on the exploration of the long-term effects of environmental conditions and personality traits on the interactions between agents in a group.

Reference-contexts: Emotion Network. An agent's emotions are represented by a network, with each node E i representing a separate emotion (Figure 3) <ref> (Ortony et al., 1988) </ref>. Each node has a set of targets, fT 1 ; T 2 ; : : : ; T n g, which represent the entities at which that emotion is directed (emotions such as happiness and surprise may be directed at oneself).

Reference-contexts: The Speech-act module then determines the actual speech-act, its addressee (s), and when it should be uttered. Selection of a Speech-act. The speech-acts that are available at each point in time, i.e., those that may be reasonably uttered after other actions or speech-acts, are controlled by a state-transition model <ref> (Stein and Thiel, 1993) </ref>. For example, the accept and reject speech-acts may be chosen only if an existing proposal is yet to be resolved.

Reference-contexts: In the future, we intend to investigate more sophisticated models of the effect of emotions on both plan generation and execution. During planning these models will take into account the effect of an agent's emotional state on its mental resources (attentional and inferential capacity <ref> (Walker, 1996) </ref>). During plan execution these models will consider different policies for resuming a previous plan after an emotional need has been addressed.
