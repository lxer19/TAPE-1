Abstract: This is the change document for V1.4 of the Garnet toolkit. We are not releasing a new manual with this version, so you will need to use this document along with the Garnet Reference Manual for V1.2, which is technical report CMU-CS-90-117, March, 1990. You will also need the change document for V1.3, which was produced on October 9, 1990.

Reference-contexts: Both versions operate the same way. the window are shown. The check boxes are selected. Eventually, a more powerful interactive design tool will be available for Garnet, called Lapidary <ref> [Myers 89] </ref>. Lapidary allows new gadgets to be constructed from scratch, and allows application-specific graphical objects to be created without programming. Unfortunately, Lapidary is not ready yet.
