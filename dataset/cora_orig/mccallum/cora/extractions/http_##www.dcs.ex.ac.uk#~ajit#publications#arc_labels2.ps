Reference-contexts: Only those strands which terminate in the desired destination node are kept. These strands are then melted (Boneh et al., 1995), i.e. double strands are separated into single strands through heating. The resulting single strands are affinity-purified <ref> (Adleman, 1994) </ref>, a process whereby the strands are checked to ensure that they each contain each of the nodes in the network.

Reference-contexts: While DNA processes within the test-tube can take place millions of times per second, extraction processes, whereby individual strands of DNA are manually isolated and spliced, can take several hours and even days, just for the simplest problems. This has led several researchers <ref> (e.g. Amos et al., 1997) </ref> to conclude that the complexity aspects of DNA algorithms will limit their applicability. This conclusion, however, ignores some fundamental biological and computational issues.

Reference-contexts: When amplification terminates the test-tube will contain all routes starting with the initial node. Only those strands which terminate in the desired destination node are kept.

Reference-contexts: towards the positive pole, can be used here. `DNA molecules are negatively charged and under an electrical field DNA molecules migrate through the gel at rates dependent upon their sizes: a small DNA molecule can thread its way through the gel easily and hence migrates faster than a larger molecule' <ref> (Old and Primrose, 1985) </ref>. The shortest DNA sequence represents the shortest route between the desired start and destination cities.
