Abstract: The recent success of multicast applications such as Internet teleconferencing illustrates the tremendous potential of applications built upon wide-area multicast communication services. A critical issue for such multicast applications and the higher layer protocols required to support them is the manner in which packet losses occur within the multicast network. In this paper we present and analyze packet loss data collected on multicast-capable hosts at 17 geographically distinct locations in Europe and the US and connected via the MBone. We experimentally and quantitatively examine the spatial and temporal correlation in packet loss among participants in a multicast session. Our results show that there is some spatial correlation in loss among the multicast sites. However, the shared loss in the backbone of the MBone is, for the most part, low. We find a fairly significant amount of of burst loss (consecutive losses) at most sites. In every dataset, at least one receiver experienced a long loss burst greater than 8 seconds (100 consecutive packets). A predominance of solitary loss was observed in all cases, but periodic losses of length approximately 0.6 seconds and at 30 second intervals were seen by some receivers.

Reference-contexts: The MBone is a virtual multicast network built on top of the physical Internet to support routing of IP multicast packets. The design of the MBone is described in 5 Backbone router Local Intermediate Router Local LAN router the MBone FAQ <ref> [7] </ref>. The nodes in the MBone are multicast-capable routers, logically connected to each other via IP routes known as tunnels. That is, multicast packets are sent, in encapsulated form, over routers which are not multicast-capable, through point-to-point connections, called tunnels.

Reference-contexts: This is possibly due to the routing updates as reported in <ref> [9] </ref>. The underlying packet loss process is of tremendous importance to error control protocols. This is particularly so with multicast communication, since many of the proposed error control protocols cited below recover from packet loss by having receivers interact with other receivers rather than with the data source itself. <p> Upon taking a closer look at the timing of the losses, it becomes clear that this cluster of bursts was due to periodic loss occurring at 30 sec intervals, a phenomenon also discussed in <ref> [9] </ref>. Figure 9 shows the length of loss bursts for the receiver cedar vs. the packet sequence number at which they began, for a window of 5000 samples. A definite periodic nature in the loss for receiver cedar is shown.

Reference-contexts: This has important implications in the context of reliable multicast. When a receiver loses a packet, it may be able to recover the packet from a nearby receiver which correctly received it, instead of directly from the sender, as discussed in <ref> [10] </ref>. Such local recovery from loss would often be possible, due to the low backbone loss. 7 Another set of measurements we made regarding the spatial locality of loss was to determine whether any packet was being dropped at the receiving hosts themselves.

Reference-contexts: One or more extremely long loss bursts, lasting from a few seconds up to 3 minutes (around 2000 consecutive packets), occur in almost every trace. Such long loss bursts have been reported in <ref> [18] </ref> for the case of point-to-point connections. * Most of the loss bursts consist of isolated single losses, but the few very long loss bursts contribute heavily to the total packet loss. * Some receivers see periodic packet loss lasting for approximately 0.6sec. (8 consecutive packets) and occurring at 30 sec. <p> With respect to temporally-correlated loss, they find that losses appear to be isolated a result somewhat different from ours; they do not address the issue of spatially correlated losses. Interesting experimental observations on routing behavior in the Internet are presented in <ref> [18] </ref> which discusses a variety of observed routing pathologies and reports outages lasting longer than 30 secs. and up to 5 minutes long, due to changes in routing connectivity. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
