Abstract: MCMAD, a program for the design of narrow-band microwave amplifiers has been developed. Starting from the measured scattering parameters, or the manufacturer's given parameters of the device, MCMAD optimizes the amplifier to meet one of the following requirements: maximum gain, minimum noise figure, or maximum gain restricted by a user-given maximum allowable value of noise figure. It implements the input and output matching networks using microstrip transmission lines. The program also ensures that the proposed amplifier is stable in the entire frequency band. This avoids any instabilities that might occur outside the desired narrow-band, due to any external noise. For transistors having stability factor, K, less than unity, the design of maximum gain amplifiers using MCMAD, has much larger gain than the stable gain typically assumed. S 12 j. Practically, the designer is limited to an even smaller value of gain[1,3]. This result was reached by equating the radius of constant operating power gain circles, R P [1,2,3], to zero, as in the case K &gt; 1, and taking the limiting case corresponding to K = 1. This procedure is not valid as R P can never take the value zero for any value of K &lt; 1. Therefore, the amplifier can have larger gain than j S 21 The second step of the design methodology is to choose the optimum load impedance that achieves maximum transducer power gain. This optimum load impedance also depends on the stability circumstances of the transistor[4]. The third design step is to test the stability of the designed amplifier in the entire frequency band. The amplifier is stable in the entire frequency band, if both the magnitude of the input reflection coefficient, and the magnitude of the output reflection coefficient are less than unity for any frequency point that has amplifier gain greater than unity (+ve dB). The Fi nal design step is to implement the resulting output and input matching circuit using microstrip lines[2].
