Title: Catalytic Inference Analysis: Detecting Inference Threats due to Knowledge Discovery

Abstract: Knowledge discovery in databases can be enhanced by introducing "catalytic relations" conveying external knowledge. The new information catalyzes database inference, manifesting latent channels. Catalytic inference is imprecise in nature, but the granularity of inference may be fine enough to create security compromises. Catalytic inference is computationally intensive. However, it can be automated by advanced search engines that gather and assemble knowledge from information repositories. The relentless information gathering potential of such search engines makes them formidable security threats. This paper presents a formalism for modeling and analyzing catalytic inference in "mixed" databases containing various precise, imprecise and fuzzy relations. The inference formalism is flexible and robust, and well-suited to implementation.

Reference-contexts: Since the restricting sets are classical (with possibility values of either zero or one), rigid constraints are enforced on the Height values. Definition: A fuzzy set X on domain D is defined by a characteristic function X (x) * <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for all x * D. A fuzzy set generalizes a classical set in that its characteristic function takes values in the interval [0; 1] instead of the set f0; 1g. <p> Definition: A fuzzy set X on domain D is defined by a characteristic function X (x) * <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for all x * D. A fuzzy set generalizes a classical set in that its characteristic function takes values in the interval [0; 1] instead of the set f0; 1g. Fuzzy sets can express subjective or linguistic statements such as "Height is about 180cm." The characteristic function of the fuzzy set, about180cm , is shown in Figure 3 (solid line). <p> The ff-cut provides a mechanism for "classicalizing" a fuzzy set by converting it to family of classical sets. Definition: The ff-level set or ff-cut of a fuzzy set X, denoted as X ff , is the classical set fx j X (x) ffg for ff * <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The strong ff-cut of a fuzzy set X, denoted as X + ff , is the classical set fx j X (x) &gt; ffg for ff * [0; 1]. <p> a fuzzy set X, denoted as X ff , is the classical set fx j X (x) ffg for ff * <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The strong ff-cut of a fuzzy set X, denoted as X + ff , is the classical set fx j X (x) &gt; ffg for ff * [0; 1]. <p> Certain fuzzy relational database models [15,19] introduce an additional tuple membership attribute. Here tuple membership is considered to be a Boolean property because database inference is examined at the unit possibility level. The extension of tuple membership to values in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> or, more generally, fuzzy sets on [0; 1], is accomplished by treating tuple membership as a separate attribute. <p> Certain fuzzy relational database models [15,19] introduce an additional tuple membership attribute.

These tuples must be subsumed to maintain entity integrity. This is accomplished by "merging" each group of redundant tuples by the set union of the respective components <ref> [1] </ref>. The merge operation defined below reduces to its classical counterpart for precise database relations.

Reference-contexts: The notion of an entropy measure for inferred information has motivated the development of our inference formalism. Indeed, the equivalence classes in the context model can be viewed as specifying the maximal spheres of influence for data elements involved in imprecise inference. The inference control tool developed by Buczkowski <ref> [2] </ref> uses Bayesian probability to estimate security risks due to imprecise inference. Buczkowski extends Mor-genstern's framework [13] to permit the propagation of imprecise inference. <p> Lunt and colleagues have investigated imprecise inference in MLS databases [4,9]. They employ the classical AI definition of abduction to determine truth values for inferred information. This truth value approach has more in common with the probability-based approaches of Morgenstern [13] and Buczkowski <ref> [2] </ref> than with the formalism described here. We believe that our approach of analyzing the information actually inferred in database extensions is better suited to dealing with the propagation of compromising inferences due to catalytic information. The DISSECT system represents the state-of-the-art in precise inference tools [14]. <p> The DISSECT system represents the state-of-the-art in precise inference tools [14].

DISSECT is an interactive graphical tool for detecting and eliminating precise inference compromises due to foreign key FDs. Our intentensional (database scheme) analysis methodology is patterned after that used by DISSECT.

Reference-contexts: The classicalization of a fuzzy set X is accomplished by decomposing it into its ff-cuts, X ff , according to the resolution identity theorem <ref> [3] </ref>: X = ff*[0;1] When the fuzzy set X is convex, i.e., its characteristic function X is a convex function on D, each X ff can be represented by a closed interval [x l ff ; x r ff is represented by the open interval (x l ff ; x r

Reference-contexts: In addition to Armstrong's axioms, certain other inference axioms exist for context-based FDs <ref> [5] </ref>. The new axioms relate FDs at different precision levels. The following inference axiom states that if an information chunk x determines some chunk y using an FD, then information more precise than x can determine infor mation less precise than y. <p> Create a hypernode referencing all nodes with attributes in Y if no such hypernode exists. Add a hyperedge between these two hypernodes. For systematic inference path exploration, the hy-pergraph can be reduced to a regular graph whose vertices are hyperedges <ref> [5] </ref>. That is, a hyperedge E (a;b) with hypernodes a and b becomes a vertex V E (a;b) in a regular graph. <p> The granularities can be compared using the channel contexts, or better still, by examining the actual inferred information. If one of these channels is considered secure, a potential inference compromise exists when the other channel does not produce information which is coarser than the secure channel <ref> [5] </ref>. A potential compromise exists when a channel produces finer information than a secure channel.

Reference-contexts: The inference methodology described here generalizes their work on precise FD-based inference and can be extended to MVD-based inference. The major implication is that algorithms for detecting and eliminating catalytic inference compromises are also NP-complete.

He introduced a valuable framework for imprecise inference analysis and highlighted the need for formal methods to deal with this difficult problem. <p> Indeed, the equivalence classes in the context model can be viewed as specifying the maximal spheres of influence for data elements involved in imprecise inference.

While our methodology also considers the propagation of imprecise inference, it examines the actual imprecise information that is inferred instead of estimating the probability to which a given value is inferred.

Reference-contexts: Analyzing precise inference compromises in database systems is difficult and time-consuming [14,17]. The need to consider external knowledge renders catalytic inference analysis more complicated. Moreover, catalytic inference analysis requires the examination of database extensions, i.e., actual database data. Precise inference analysis, as exemplified by SRI's DISSECT system <ref> [14] </ref>, only considers database schemes (intensions). This paper describes a formalism for modeling imprecise inference due to abstract functional dependencies (FDs). The formalism addresses thorny integration and interoperability issues in "mixed databases" containing various precise, imprecise (set-valued) and fuzzy database relations. <p> These contexts provide the lower bounds on the precision or granularity of the information flow at each channel node. While an inference path comprising the attribute sets at each node of an inference channel can be obtained by intensional analysis (as in the DISSECT system <ref> [14] </ref>), the computation of the channel node contexts and the actual information inferred using the channel involve the analysis of database relations (extension). 4.3. Inference Axioms Inference axioms are necessary for building inference channels. <p> We believe that our approach of analyzing the information actually inferred in database extensions is better suited to dealing with the propagation of compromising inferences due to catalytic information.

Reference-contexts: This paper describes a formalism for modeling imprecise inference due to abstract functional dependencies (FDs). The formalism addresses thorny integration and interoperability issues in "mixed databases" containing various precise, imprecise (set-valued) and fuzzy database relations. Generalized database integrity properties are provided for "classicalizing" <ref> [16] </ref> and seamlessly integrating imprecise/fuzzy catalytic information with precise information in inference analysis. <p> A potential security compromise exists when more precise estimates of Salary are obtained by introducing additional external information in database inference. 3. Database Model This section describes the model for unifying classical, imprecise and fuzzy relations. Integration and interoperabililty are achieved by generalizing the main classical database integrity properties <ref> [16] </ref>. The model is defined using fuzzy sets which generalize classical sets (imprecise values) and singleton sets (precise values). The focus is on imprecise inference or fuzzy inference at the unit membership level (ff-level = 1). Thus, all properties are defined at the unit membership level only. <p> The mixed database model will accomodate these definitions while respecting the core integrity properties underlying the classical and imprecise relational database models. 3.3. Contexts and Domain Integrity Integrity constraints in the mixed database model are enforced using domain partitions or "contexts" <ref> [16] </ref>. A context C is a partition on a subset ^ D of a database domain D. It is generated by an equivalence relation on ^ D capturing natural semantic equivalences existing between domain elements. The equivalence classes in context C are sets of indistinguishable elements.
