Abstract: One of the most challenging problems in Artificial Life remains the creation of open ended evolution. A number of current efforts are directed at this problem. One characteristic that these efforts generally share is that they parallel the origin of life event, in that they attempt to create pre-biotic conditions from which Artificial Life may emerge spontaneously and evolve in an open ended fashion. While the origin of life is generally recognized as an event of the first order, there is another event in the history of life that is less well known but of comparable significance. The origin of biological diversity and at the same time of macroscopic multi-cellular life, occurred abruptly in the Cambrian explosion 600 million years ago. This event involved a riotous diversification of life forms. Dozens of phyla appeared suddenly, many existing only fleetingly, as diverse and sometimes bizarre ways of life were explored in a relative ecological void. I discuss an approach to AL that parallels this second major event in the history of life, the origin of diversity. Rather than attempting to create pre-biotic conditions from which life may emerge, this approach involves engineering over the first 3 billion years of life's history to design complex evolvable artificial organisms, and attempting to create the biological conditions that will set off a spontaneous evolutionary process of increasing diversity and complexity of organisms. This is a very difficult undertaking, because in the midst of the Cambrian explosion, life had evolved to a level of complexity in which emergent properties existed at many hierarchical levels: molecular, cellular, organismal, populational and community. In order to define an approach to the synthesis of Artificial Life paralleling this historical stage of organic life, we must examine each of the fundamental hierarchical levels and abstract the principal biological properties from their physical representation, and determine how they can be represented in our chosen artificial media. I will discuss some of the outstanding biological properties of several of these levels, in the context of Artificial Life. This is an exercise in considering the extension of biological properties to life forms beyond the organic.

Reference-contexts: This is the principal theme of this paper, that interactions with other evolving species provide the primary driving force in evolution. These interactions must be incorporated into Artificial Life models in order to move evolution. The Enigma of Sex The preponderance of sex remains an enigma to evolutionary theory <ref> (Bell 1982) </ref>. Careful analysis has failed to show any benefits from sex that outweigh the high costs (e.g., passing on only half of the genome). The only obvious benefit of sex is that it provides diversity among the offspring, allowing the species to adapt more readily to a changing environment.

Reference-contexts: Predatory or parasitic species might evolve adaptations to exploit other individuals by seizure of their processor threads or allocated memory. Prey or host species may evolve strategies to defend their memory or CPU resources. This is a sort of free form evolutionary core wars <ref> (Dewdney 1984, 1987) </ref>, a core wars where the only rule is the survival of the fittest. Below I will discuss biological principles and processes and how they relate to digital organisms. This is an exercise in consiering the extension of biological properties to life forms beyond the organic.

Reference-contexts: Transposons do produce gene products (e.g., transposase) and often are involved in gene regulation. However, they may have no effect on the external phenotype of the individual <ref> (Doolittle and Sapienza, 1980) </ref>. Therefore they evolve through another paradigm of selection, one that does not involve an external phenotype. They are seen as a mechanism for the selfish spread of DNA which may become inactive junk after mutation (Orgel and Crick, 1980).

Reference-contexts: This event involved a riotous diversification of life forms. Dozens of phyla appeared suddenly, many existing only fleetingly, as diverse and sometimes bizarre ways of life were explored in a relative ecological void <ref> (Gould, 1990) </ref>. This period of intense experimentation is recorded in some of the rare fossil deposits of the period that were of a quality to preserve soft body parts (Morris, 1989).

Reference-contexts: Mobile genetic elements, transposons, have this intra-genome self-replicating property. It has been estimated that 80% of spontaneous mutations are caused by transposons <ref> (Green, 1988) </ref>. Repeated sequences, resulting from the activity of mobile elements, range from dozens to millions in numbers of copies, and from hundreds to tens of thousands of base pairs in length. They vary widely in dispersion patterns from clumped to sparse (Jelinek and Schmid, 1982).

Reference-contexts: Somehow the principle of competitive exclusion is circumvented. There are many theories on how competitive exclusion may be circumvented. One leading theory is that periodic disturbance at the proper level sets back the process of competitive exclusion, allowing more species to coexist <ref> (Huston 1979) </ref>. There is substantial evidence that moderate levels of disturbance can increase diversity. In a digital community, disturbance might take the form of freeing blocks of memory that had been filled with digital organisms. It would be very easy to experiment with differing frequencies and patch sizes of disturbance.

Reference-contexts: Repeated sequences, resulting from the activity of mobile elements, range from dozens to millions in numbers of copies, and from hundreds to tens of thousands of base pairs in length. They vary widely in dispersion patterns from clumped to sparse <ref> (Jelinek and Schmid, 1982) </ref>. Transposons code for an enzyme, "transposase", which makes a copy of the transposon and inserts it somewhere else in the genome of the same cell, though not all mobile elements code for their own transposase.

Reference-contexts: The need for this can be seen in AL models such as cellular automata where virtual state machines pass through one another <ref> (Langton 1986) </ref>, or in core wars type simulations where coherent structure that arise demolish one another when they come into contact (Rasmussen, Feldberg, Hindsholm and Knudsen, preprint). An analog to the cell membrane that can be used in the core wars type of simulation is memory allocation.

Reference-contexts: Properly constructed Artificial Life models can reflect the bottom up structure of hierarchically organized living systems, in which the behavior of the system at any level is an emergent property resulting from the interactions of a population of behavors of the next lower level <ref> (Langton 1989) </ref>. Ecologists tend to treat organisms as black boxes, therefore Artificial Life models may turn out to be appropriate for the exploration of ecological processes as long as they preserve the proper relationships between individuals and species.

Reference-contexts: This could determine if the presence of heterotrophs is necessary to maintain diversity as well as to generate it. Species Area Effect One of the most universal ecological laws is the species area relationship <ref> (MacArthur and Wilson 1967) </ref>. It has been demonstrated that in a wide variety of contexts, the number of species occupying an "area" increases with the area. The number of species increases in proportion to the area raised to a power between 0.1 and 0.3.

Reference-contexts: Therefore they evolve through another paradigm of selection, one that does not involve an external phenotype. They are seen as a mechanism for the selfish spread of DNA which may become inactive junk after mutation <ref> (Orgel and Crick, 1980) </ref>. DNA of transposon origin can be recognized by their palindrome endings flanked by short non-reversed repeated sequences resulting from insertion after staggered cuts. In Drosophila melanogaster approximately 5 to 10 percent of its total DNA is composed of sequences bearing these signs.

Reference-contexts: Then in the Cambrian, there was a sudden explosion of diversity. Macroscopic multicellular organisms appeared, both metazoans and metaphytes, and most of the major groups of modern organisms followed rapidly. One theory to explain this explosive diversification <ref> (Stanley 1973) </ref> is that it was sparked by the appearance of the first organisms that ate other organisms. As long as all organisms were autotrophs, there was only room for a few species. In a community with only one trophic level, the most successful competitors would dominate.

Reference-contexts: There are many families of such repeated elements, each family possessing a distinctive nucleotide sequence, and distributed in many sites throughout the genome. One well known repeated sequence occuring in humans is found to have as many as a half million copies in each haploid genome <ref> (Strickberger 1985) </ref>. Elaborate mechanisms have evolved to edit out junk sequences inserted into critical regions.

Reference-contexts: In many cases transposons carry a sequence that acts as a promotor, altering the regulation of genes at the site of insertion <ref> (Syvanen, 1984) </ref>. Transposons do produce gene products (e.g., transposase) and often are involved in gene regulation. However, they may have no effect on the external phenotype of the individual (Doolittle and Sapienza, 1980). Therefore they evolve through another paradigm of selection, one that does not involve an external phenotype.

Reference-contexts: It has been estimated that typically 98% of the DNA in eukaryotes is neither translated into proteins nor involved in gene regulation, that it is simply "junk" DNA <ref> (Thomas, 1971) </ref>. Orgel and Crick (1980) and Doolittle and Sapienza (1980) have suggested that this junk code is the result of the self-replication of pieces of DNA within rather than between cells. Mobile genetic elements, transposons, have this intra-genome self-replicating property.

Reference-contexts: Therefore it follows logically that all extant organisms are well adapted to their environment. This logic seems to present a paradox: if all extant organisms are well adapted, then what is evolution doing? The Red Queen hypothesis <ref> (Van Valen, 1973) </ref> suggests that in the face of a changing environment, organisms must evolve as fast as they can in order to simply maintain their current state of adaptation. "In order to get anywhere you must run twice as fast as that" (Carroll, 1865).
