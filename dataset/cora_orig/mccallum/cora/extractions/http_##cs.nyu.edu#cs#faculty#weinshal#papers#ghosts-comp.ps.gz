Abstract: I have previously described psychophysical experiments that involved the perception of many transparent layers, corresponding to multiple matching, in doubly ambiguous random dot stereograms. Additional experiments are described in the first part of this paper. In one experiment, subjects were required to report the density of dots on each transparent layer. In another experiment, the minimal density of dots on each layer, which is required for the subjects to perceive it as a distinct transparent layer, was measured. The difficulties encountered by stereo matching algorithms, when applied to doubly ambiguous stereograms, are described in the second part of this paper. Algorithms that can be modified to perform consistently with human perception, and the constraints imposed on their parameters by human perception, are discussed.

Reference-contexts: The second algorithm is Prazdny's stereo matching algorithm [8]. This algorithm identifies and matches features in both images using a measure closely related to the disparity gradient defined in <ref> [1] </ref> in order to enforce smooth matching. Disparity gradient is defined for two features in one image, each assigned a specific disparity: it is the disparity difference between the two features divided by the distance (averaged over both images) between the features. <p> This support is given only if the disparity gradient between the two neighbors is smaller than a certain threshold, the disparity gradient limit. The use of this particular smoothing method was based on psychophysical evidence <ref> [1] </ref> that simultaneous stereo fusion of two features is possible only if the disparity gradient between them is smaller than 1. <p> Table 3 gives the disparity gradient between L 1 and L 2 for each of these matchings. The disparity gradient is defined to be <ref> [1] </ref> the difference between the disparities assigned to the two features divided by the average distance (in the two images) between the two features.

Reference-contexts: In Section 4, the difficulties encountered by stereo matching algorithms, when applied to doubly ambiguous stereograms, are discussed. Three simple matching algorithms, representing two different simple matching principles, are discussed in detail: a patch-wise correlation algorithm (e.g. <ref> [5, 2] </ref>), Prazdny's matching algorithm [8], and PMF [7]. For comparison with human data, an additional stage was added to each algorithm, where the matching results were used to determine how many transparent layers exist in the image. <p> These algorithms were selected for their simplicity and as representatives of two different matching principles; it is not suggested here that they are biologically plausible and it is not assumed that they can deal with noisy real images. The first is a patch-wise correlation algorithm (e.g. <ref> [5, 2] </ref>), in which the disparity selected at each feature is the disparity that maximizes the correlation between a patch around the Spatial Vision 7 (2):183-198, 1993 11 feature in one image and a corresponding displaced patch in the second image. The second algorithm is Prazdny's stereo matching algorithm [8].

Reference-contexts: Each dot of the original sparse random pattern (Fig. 1b) has two copies in each image. All these pairs, which are the micropattern of the doubly ambiguous RDS (Fig. 1c), are the same instance of the double nail illusion stimulus <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> They subjectively perceived a distinct layer at a given disparity when more than 7% of the dots in the image could be matched at that disparity. 3.3 Experiment 3: the micropattern of a doubly ambiguous RDS In the double nail illusion experiment <ref> [4] </ref>, in which a configuration similar to the micropattern of a doubly ambiguous stereogram (Section 2.3) was used, Krol & van de Grind reported that subjects selected only those disparities corresponding to the full circles in Fig. 1c. <p> The conditions of the experiment described in Section 2.3 were repeated, where the isolated micropatterns were presented to the subjects instead of the ambiguous stereograms. Two subjects participated in this experiment. In agreement with <ref> [4] </ref>, both subjects selected only those disparities corresponding to the full circles in Fig. 1c in all cases. 4 Computational discussion The first experiment described in Section 3.1 suggests that the multiple matching effect, discussed in Section 2.3, can possibly be explained by an algorithm that selects at each feature a <p> Spatial Vision 7 (2):183-198, 1993 12 The example shown in Fig. 4 is a simple ambiguous configuration, similar to the one used in the double nail illusion experiment <ref> [4] </ref>. This example is the micropattern of the experiment described in Section 2.3 (namely, the stereogram in that experiment is made of a random distribution of such patterns).

Reference-contexts: In order to explain human perception in the experiments discussed in Section 2.3, the threshold had to be reset to 0:5 Spatial Vision 7 (2):183-198, 1993 13 (as noted in the caption of Fig. 1 in <ref> [6] </ref>). Unfortunately, this change of the threshold value resulted in a failure of the PMF algorithm to account for some other known psychophysical results, as discussed above. The example above is not an accident. <p> The PMF algorithm, on the other hand, responds to both type of stimuli in a similar manner. Thus Pollard & Frisby's letter <ref> [6] </ref> demonstrates the difficulty encountered by stereo matching algorithms when dealing with doubly ambiguous random dot stereograms.

Reference-contexts: In Section 4, the difficulties encountered by stereo matching algorithms, when applied to doubly ambiguous stereograms, are discussed. Three simple matching algorithms, representing two different simple matching principles, are discussed in detail: a patch-wise correlation algorithm (e.g. [5, 2]), Prazdny's matching algorithm [8], and PMF <ref> [7] </ref>. For comparison with human data, an additional stage was added to each algorithm, where the matching results were used to determine how many transparent layers exist in the image. <p> The most supported disparity is selected at each feature. Thus, since the algorithm uses the disparity gradient to evaluate the quality of a particular match, larger differences in disparity are tolerated for features that are further apart. The third algorithm is PMF <ref> [7] </ref>. Like Prazdny's matching algorithm, the PMF algorithm uses the disparity gradient between two features to enforce smoothness of the disparity field. In this algorithm, each candidate match (disparity) at a given feature accumulates support from neighboring features before the selection of the best (or most supported) match. <p> The correlation based algorithm performs similarly to PMF with disparity gradient limit of 0:5, namely, it fails. However, since a correlation-based algorithm is not designed for the matching of isolated features, this failure is not surprising. Discussion Initially it was suggested in <ref> [7] </ref> that a disparity gradient limit of 1 should be the threshold in the PMF algorithm when used to model human stereo vision.

Reference-contexts: It is generally assumed that many neighboring features should have a match at about the same disparity for a matching to be plausible. Different stereo matching algorithms differ in how they implement this neighborhood interaction (or smoothness constraint), among other things. I have previously described <ref> [9, 10] </ref> psychophysical experiments whose results could not be readily explained by existing stereo matching algorithms. <p> The right image is shown above the left image for purpose of illustration. The separation between the nails is 2 pixels in the right image and 4 in the left, where each pixel corresponds to roughly 1.2 minutes of arc as in <ref> [9] </ref>. Spatial Vision 7 (2):183-198, 1993 12 The example shown in Fig. 4 is a simple ambiguous configuration, similar to the one used in the double nail illusion experiment [4]. <p> The difficulty follows from one of the points discussed in <ref> [9] </ref>, namely, humans' response to isolated micropatterns (such as Fig. 4) appears to be different from their response to the stereograms discussed in Section 2.3. The PMF algorithm, on the other hand, responds to both type of stimuli in a similar manner.
