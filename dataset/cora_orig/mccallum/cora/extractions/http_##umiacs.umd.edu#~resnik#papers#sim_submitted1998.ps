Title: Semantic Similarity in a Taxonomy: An Information-Based Measure and its Application to Problems of Ambiguity
Author: Philip Resnik

Abstract: This paper presents a measure of semantic similarity in an is-a taxonomy based on the notion of shared information content. Experimental evaluation against a benchmark set of human similarity judgments demonstrates that the measure performs significantly better than the traditional edge counting approach. The paper presents algorithms that take advantage of taxonomic similarity in resolving syntactic and semantic ambiguity, along with experimental results demonstrating their effectiveness.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, uniform link distance is difficult to define, much less to control. In real taxonomies, there is wide variability in the "distance" covered by a single taxonomic link, particularly when certain sub-taxonomies (e.g. biological categories) are much denser than others. For example, in WordNet <ref> (Miller, 1990) </ref>, a widely used, broad-coverage semantic network for English, it is not at all difficult to find links that cover an intuitively narrow distance (rabbit ears is-a television antenna) or an intuitively wide one (phytoplankton is-a living thing).

Reference-contexts: Sussna (1993) uses semantic relatedness measured with WordNet in word sense disambiguation, defining a measure of distance that weights different types of links and also explicitly takes depth in the taxonomy into account. Following the original proposal to measure semantic similarity using information content <ref> (Resnik, 1993b, 1993a) </ref>, a number of related proposals have been explored. Leacock and Chodorow (Leacock & Chodorow, 1994) define a measure resembling information content, but using the normalized path length between the two concepts being compared rather than the probability of a subsuming concept. <p> Acknowledgements 23 Resnik This paper is a revised and significantly extended version of (Resnik, 1995).

Reference-contexts: al. (Rada, Mili, Bicknell, & Blettner, 1989) suggest that the assessment of similarity in semantic networks can in fact be thought of as involving just taxonomic (is-a) links, to the exclusion of other link types; that view will also be taken here, although admittedly it excludes some potentially useful information <ref> (Richardson, Smeaton, & Murphy, 1994) </ref>. A natural, time-honored way to evaluate semantic similarity in a taxonomy is to evaluate the distance between the nodes corresponding to the items being compared | the shorter the path from one node to another, the more similar they are. <p> of x | unlike information content, which has been criticized on the grounds that the value of self-similarity depends on how specific a concept x is, and that two non-identical items x and y can be rated more similar to each other than a third item z is to itself <ref> (Richardson et al., 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, if the taxonomy has a unique top node then its probability is 1. Following the standard argumentation of information theory <ref> (Ross, 1976) </ref>, the information content of a concept c can be quantified as negative the log likelihood, log p (c). Notice that quantifying information content in this way makes intuitive sense in this setting: as probability increases, informativeness decreases, so the more abstract a concept, the lower its information content.

Reference-contexts: An experiment by Miller and Charles (1991) provided appropriate human subject data for the task. In their study, 38 undergraduate subjects were given 30 pairs of nouns that were chosen to cover high, intermediate, and low levels of similarity (as determined using a previous study <ref> (Rubenstein & Goodenough, 1965) </ref>), and those subjects were asked to rate "similarity of meaning" for each pair on a scale from 0 (no similarity) to 4 (perfect synonymy). The average rating for each pair thus represents a good estimate of how similar the two words are, according to human judgments.

Reference-contexts: This is consistent with Rada et al.'s (1989) treatment of "disjunctive concepts" using edge counting: they define the distance between two disjunctive sets of concepts as the minimum path length from any element of 1. In a feature-based setting (e.g. <ref> (Tversky, 1977) </ref>), this would be reflected by explicit shared features: nickels and dimes are both small, round, metallic, and so on. These features are captured implicitly by the taxonomy in categorizing nickel and dime as subordinates of coin. 3 Resnik the first set to any element of the second.

Reference-contexts: same task. 11 In the remainder of this section I describe a new application of the algorithm, and evaluate its performance. 5.2 Linking to WordNet using a Bilingual Dictionary Multilingual resources for natural language processing can be difficult to obtain, although some promising efforts are underway in projects like EuroWordNet <ref> (Vossen, Diez-Orzas, & Peters, 1997) </ref>. For many languages, however, such large-scale resources are unlikely to be available in the near future, and individual research efforts will have to continue to build from scratch or to adapt existing resources such as bilingual dictionaries (e.g., Klavans & Tzoukermann, 1995).

Reference-contexts: and storage procedures: does it represent a conjunction of food handling and storage procedures, or does it refer to the handling and storage of food? The second application concerns the resolution of word sense ambiguity | not for words in running text, which is a large open problem (though cf. <ref> (Wilks & Stevenson, 1996) </ref>), but for groups of related words as are often discovered by distributional analysis of text corpora or found in dictionaries and thesauri. Finally, Section 6 discusses related work. 2.
