Abstract: Effective information gathering on the WWW is a complex task requiring planning, scheduling, text processing, and interpretation-style reasoning about extracted data to resolve inconsistencies and to refine hypothesis about the data. This paper describes the rationale, architecture, and implementation of a next generation information gathering system a system that integrates several areas of AI research under a single research umbrella. The goal of this system is to exploit the vast amount of information sources available today on the NII including a growing number of digital libraries, independent news agencies, government agencies, as well as human experts providing a variety of services. The large number of information sources and their different levels of accessibility, reliability and associated costs present a complex information gathering coordination problem. Our solution is an information gathering agent, BIG, that plans to gather information to support a decision process, reasons about the resource trade-offs of different possible gathering approaches, extracts information from both unstructured and structured documents, and uses the extracted information to refine its search and processing activities.

Reference-contexts: We are experimenting with enhancements to our information extraction systems to cope with this and planning to use a tf/idf style document classifier <ref> [1] </ref> to prequalify documents before running the extraction system on them. We have also learned new things about the Design-to-Criteria scheduler and discovered some modeling problems with applying the TMS task modeling framework to this application.

Reference-contexts: In many cases, manual browsing through even a limited portion of the relevant information obtainable through advancing information retrieval (IR) and information extraction (IE) technologies <ref> [2, 12, 9] </ref> is no longer effective. The time/quality/cost tradeoffs offered by the collection of information sources and the dynamic nature of the environment lead us to conclude that the user cannot (and should not) serve as the detailed controller of the information gathering (IG) process.

The planner receives an initial action schedule from the scheduler and then handles information gathering and processing activities.

Reference-contexts: The task assessor encodes the plans in the TMS <ref> [7] </ref> generic, domain-independent task modeling framework. The TMS models then serve as input to the agent scheduler and other agent control components that will be added in the future (e.g., a multi-agent coordination module). <p> The database is constructed by an o*ine Web spider and modified during the search process to reflect newly discovered sites and data. This object has information aging concerns similar to those of the object database. Modeling Framework The TMS <ref> [7] </ref> task modeling language is used to hierarchically model the information gathering process and enumerate alternative ways to accomplish the high-level gathering goals.
