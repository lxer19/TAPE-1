Abstract: Action algebras have been proposed by Pratt [22] as an alternative to Kleene algebras [8, 9]. Their chief advantage over Kleene algebras is that they form a finitely-based equational variety, so the essential properties of fl (iteration) are captured purely equationally. However, unlike Kleene algebras, they are not closed under the formation of matrices, which renders them inapplicable in certain constructions in automata theory and the design and analysis of algorithms. In this paper we consider a class of action algebras called action lattices. An action lattice is simply an action algebra that forms a lattice under its natural order. Action lattices combine the best features of Kleene algebras and action algebras: like action algebras, they form a finitely-based equational variety; like Kleene algebras, they are closed under the formation of matrices. Moreover, they form the largest subvariety of action algebras for which this is true. All common examples of Kleene algebras appearing in automata theory, logics of programs, relational algebra, and the design and analysis of algorithms are action lattices.

Using matrices over an arbitrary Kleene algebra, one can give a single uniform solution from which each of these applications can be derived as a special case.

Reference-contexts: Besides equations, the axiomatization of Kleene algebras contains the two 2 equational implications ax x ) a fl x x (1) It is known that no finite equational axiomatization exists over this signature [23] (although well-behaved infinite equational axiomatizations have been given <ref> [13, 2] </ref>). Pratt [22] argues that this is due to an inherent nonmono-tonicity associated with the fl operator. This nonmonitonicity is handled in Kleene algebras with the equational implications (1) and (2).

Pratt <ref> [22] </ref> argues that this is due to an inherent nonmono-tonicity associated with the fl operator. This nonmonitonicity is handled in Kleene algebras with the equational implications (1) and (2). <p> This nonmonitonicity is handled in Kleene algebras with the equational implications (1) and (2). In light of the negative result of [23], it is quite surprising that the essential properties of fl should be captured purely equationally. Pratt <ref> [22] </ref> shows that this is possible over an expanded signature. <p> Not the least problem is conflict of notation in the literature. For the purposes of this paper, we follow <ref> [22] </ref> and use + and for join and meet, respectively, and ; for composition ([8, 9, 10] use for composition). For ease of reference, we collect all operators, signatures, axioms, and classes of structures together in four tables. <p> We avoid parentheses by assigning fl highest priority, then ;, then all the other operators. Thus a + bc fl should be parsed a + (b (c fl )). The expression a b is considered an abbreviation for the equation a+b = b. As shown in <ref> [22] </ref>, the two definitions of RES given in Table 4 are equivalent. <p> Lemma 3.1 ACT = RKA. Proof. Every action algebra is a residuation algebra by definition. As shown in <ref> [22] </ref>, every action algebra is a Kleene algebra. This establishes the forward inclusion. Conversely, we show that the properties (23) and (24) hold in all resid-uated Kleene algebras. By symmetry, it will suffice to show (23). <p> I would also like to thank the workshop participants, particularly Larry Moss and Dana Scott, for valuable comments. Finally, I am deeply indebted to Vaughan Pratt for insight and inspiration derived from his paper <ref> [22] </ref> and from many engaging discussions.

Pratt [22] argues that this is due to an inherent nonmono-tonicity associated with the fl operator. This nonmonitonicity is handled in Kleene algebras with the equational implications (1) and (2). In light of the negative result of [23], it is quite surprising that the essential properties of fl should be captured purely equationally. Pratt [22] shows that this is possible over an expanded signature.
