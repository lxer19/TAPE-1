Abstract: Many new network applications demand interprocess communication (ipc) services that are not supported by existing transport protocol mechanisms. Large bandwidth-delay products of high-speed networks also render the existing error control mechanisms inefficient. This paper presents the design, evaluation, and implementation of an application-oriented error control scheme that can support efficient ipc for these applications in high-speed network environments.

Reference-contexts: For example, vmtp [3] and snr [11] have used loss detection timers at the sender side, while netblt used a receiver side timer [4]. A gap-based loss detection method was first used in a link level protocol cpm <ref> [1] </ref>. 2.3.

Reference-contexts: The fec has mainly been used in deep space communications where the propagation delay is very large (e.g., several hundred milliseconds), and its usefulness in high speed networks is currently being explored in protocols such as tp++ <ref> [2] </ref>. The alternative schemes under the retransmission-based error control are examined next. 3 Loss detection can be based on a timer or on gaps in packet sequence numbers. With a timer--based scheme, the timer can be located at either the sender or the receiver side.

Reference-contexts: Current implementation of tcp uses a cumulative ack scheme with a loss timer at the sender side.

Reference-contexts: IMPLEMENTATION The proposed error control scheme has been implemented along with a flow control scheme as part of a segment streaming transport protocol (sstp) inside the SunOS 4:0:3 kernel. Sstp is built on top of a connection-oriented internet protocol (coip) designed by Cranor <ref> [5] </ref>. Figure 14 displays the protocol hierarchy used in the sstp implementation. Applications use sstp service through the standard socket interface. Sstp provides flow-controlled segment streams with variable degrees of reliability by building on the services provided by ctp; and ctp is supported by the Ethernet protocol csma/cd.

Doshi and his colleagues have also shown that snr error control scheme outperforms those used in existing protocols <ref> [6] </ref>. Therefore, the proposed error control scheme is compared with the snr scheme. Table 1 provides a qualitative comparison between the two schemes.

Reference-contexts: The scheme has been evaluated using analysis and simulation, and it has been implemented in software inside SunOS 4:0:3 kernel. This paper presents the design and main results for the error control scheme. A more detailed report is available in <ref> [8] </ref>. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews briefly the existing error control schemes. Section 3 discusses how the proposed scheme addresses the key error control issues. Section 4 describes in detail the packet formats used as well as the operations of the proposed scheme. <p> Details of the flow control are available in <ref> [8] </ref>. Simple window control operations will be explained as necessary when error control operations are presented. 12 4.2. Error Control Operations It is assumed that a connection between the sender and the receiver has already been set up. <p> Let g = [1 (1 p) s ] denote the probability that a segment will require at least one packet retransmission. The following expressions can be derived using this approach (see <ref> [8] </ref> for details): T hE N actual N ideal 2w a + 1 + p + W g 1 T hE 2w a + 1 + p + min (W w a ; w a (1 p)) + g 1 (w a + 1) &lt; W &lt; (2w a + 1) <p> The durations for each state can be deterministic or exponentially distributed. 5.3. Numerical Results This section presents and discusses a small subset of results from the simulation study. More results are available in <ref> [8] </ref>. 24 Window Size (W/wa) Throughput Efficiency 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 0.2 0.6 1.0 p=10^-3 pkt=1024B seg=16pkts peak=50Mbps rtd=60ms Throughput Efficiency with Random Loss simulation are shown for comparison. The connected lines correspond to the analysis and the discrete symbols are for simulation. <p> Since the control mechanisms of sstp have been designed to maintain efficient operation even in large bandwidth-delay product networks, sstp is expected to perform much better than tcp in high-speed network environments. More detailed results of the implementation are reported in <ref> [8] </ref>. 31 7. SUMMARY This paper has presented an application-oriented error control scheme for high speed networks. It is designed as a transport protocol mechanism for distributed pipeline applications.

Reference-contexts: Extensive trace data has been collected that verified the error control function. We also measured the throughput performance of the sstp implementation using both custom software and a kernel probe technique developed by Papadopoulos <ref> [13] </ref>. The protocol processing delay results are summarized in Table 2. Protocol processing delays at both the sending and receiving ends are measured on a large number of packets. The resulting average is shown in the second column of the table.
