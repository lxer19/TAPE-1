Abstract: A neural network model for the self-organization of ocular dominance and lateral connections from binocular input is presented. The self-organizing process results in a network where (1) afferent weights of each neuron organize into smooth hill-shaped receptive fields primarily on one of the retinas, (2) neurons with common eye preference form connected, intertwined patches, and (3) lateral connections primarily link regions of the same eye preference. Similar self-organization of cortical structures has been observed experimentally in strabismic kittens. The model shows how patterned lateral connections in the cortex may develop based on correlated activity and explains why lateral connection patterns follow receptive field properties such as ocular dominance.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Lateral connections in the primary visual cortex have a patterned structure that closely matches the response properties of cortical cells (Gilbert and Wiesel 1989; Malach et al.1993). For example, in the normal visual cortex, long-range lateral connections link areas with similar orientation preference <ref> (Gilbert and Wiesel 1989) </ref>. Like cortical response properties, the connectivity pattern is highly plastic in early development and can be altered by experience (Katz and Callaway 1992).

Reference-contexts: Gaussians) and assumed to be uniform throughout the network; lateral connectivity is not explicitly taken into account. Such models do not explicitly replicate the activity dynamics of the visual cortex, and therefore can make only limited predictions about cortical function. We have previously shown how Kohonen's self-organizing feature maps <ref> (Kohonen 1982) </ref> can be generalized to include self-organizing lateral connections and recurrent activity dynamics (the Laterally Interconnected Synergetically Self-Organizing Map (LISSOM); Sirosh and Miikkulainen 1993, 1994a), and how the algorithm can model the development of ocular dominance columns and patterned lateral connectivity with abstractions of visual input.

Reference-contexts: By Hebbian adaptation, lateral inhibition concentrates in the neighborhood of each neuron, and the distance at which activations becomes anticorrelated decreases. Therefore, smaller monocular patches develop, and the ocular dominance wavelength decreases. Similar dependence was very recently observed in the cat primary visual cortex <ref> (Lowel 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For example, when a small area of the cortex is set inactive (or lesioned), the sharply-tuned afferent weight profiles of the neurons surrounding that region expand in size, and neurons begin to respond to the stimuli that previously activated only the lesioned area <ref> (Sirosh and Miikkulainen 1994b, 1994c) </ref>.
