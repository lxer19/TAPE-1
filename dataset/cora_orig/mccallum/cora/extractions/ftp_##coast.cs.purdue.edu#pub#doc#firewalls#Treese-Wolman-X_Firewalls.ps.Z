Reference-contexts: Many of these potential problems with TCP/IP are discussed by Bellovin <ref> [1] </ref>. Although we do not consider them here, these potential problems should be considered when designing a real firewall system. 5 A RELAY FOR THE X WINDOW SYSTEM 7 5 A Relay for the X Window System Some applications are difficult to operate securely with traditional firewall configurations.
Reference: [2] <author> Bill Cheswick. </author> <title> The design of a secure internet gateway. </title> <booktitle> In Proceedings of the USENIX Summer Conference, </booktitle> <year> 1990. </year>
Reference-contexts: This isolation is only partial, because communication is the goal of the connection in the first place. Unfortunately, the Internet is not always a safe place, and some form of protection is necessary. A firewall (sometimes called a "gateway"), such as those described by Cheswick <ref> [2] </ref>, Ranum [11], or Schauer and Wolfhugel [13], is a collection of computers intended to protect an organization connected to a public network. The fundamental premise in the design of firewalls is that it is easier to secure a small number of systems rather than hundreds or thousands.

Reference-contexts: Because it has no real knowledge of the application, it cannot perform application-specific actions such as those we use for xforward. 7.2 Policy Routing Policy routing, such as the architecture described by Clark <ref> [3] </ref>, enables routers to make decisions based on resource policies, including security as well as other considerations such as link speed or cost. Clark proposes an architecture in which policy routes are synthesized by the source host and its administrative domain.

Reference-contexts: For example, a router would not be able to create the xforward prompt for a new connection, since it has no knowledge of the protocols it is routing. 7.4 Why the Application Layer? Estrin and Tsudik <ref> [4] </ref> argue that the network layer is the appropriate place for inter-organizational access controls. This conclusion is based on the design principle of the end-to-end argument [12].

Reference-contexts: In practice, the main problem is that it requires wide deployment of both end systems and routers capable of creating and enforcing policy routes. Therefore we could not build a system based on policy routing. 7.3 Visa Protocols Visa protocols <ref> [5] </ref> are another approach to managing the flow of packets between organizations. A "visa" is an unforgeable cryptographic stamp attached to a packet. In the same way that a passport visa grants permission to visit a country, a packet's visa grants it permission to enter or leave an organization.

Reference-contexts: Hence, it may be reasonable to limit the data rate on the outbound connection to (say) 9600 bits per second. This is surely fast enough to handle a person typing; we are not interested in anything more. 6.3 WHOIS WHOIS <ref> [6] </ref> is a TCP-based query/response service, often used as a directory service. The Internet Network Information Center (NIC) has historically maintained a name lookup service for individuals on the Internet (although the Internet is now so large as to make maintaining a centralized directory impossible).

Reference-contexts: The routers used in the firewall are often capable of "screening" packets to select desired ones and discard undesired ones. Screening routers can be used to permit direct access between internal machines and external ones. One screening router implementation for UNIX systems is described by Mogul <ref> [7] </ref> (although not all of these have the flexibility of the one Mogul describes). Similar capabilities are now available in many commercial routers. Such systems allow a system manager to select packets based on some combination of protocol, source and destination IP address, and source and destination port numbers.

Reference-contexts: The alternative approaches discussed here vary primarily in what information is used to make routing decisions. 7.1 Screening Routers As we have discussed, a screening router can be an important component of a firewall system. A screening router permits an organization to implement a variety of security policies <ref> [8] </ref>. Unfortunately, a screening router alone cannot always satisfy the administrative policy for a given applica 7 OTHER APPROACHES 15 tion.

Reference-contexts: If, on the other hand, we understood the FTP implementation and did not fully understand the policy, we might conclude that such a relay is not permissible. 6.2 Telnet Telnet <ref> [9] </ref> is widely used on the Internet for remote logins. General telnet access between internal and external machines can serve many purposes, supporting cooperative work projects, customer support, and traveling employees who need to read their electronic mail.

Reference-contexts: For comparison, the section concludes with analyses of electronic mail and USENET news in the same framework. 6.1 FTP The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) <ref> [10] </ref> is widely used on the Internet for copying files. We may wish to allow many people on internal systems to copy files to and from external systems. With the policies we are currently considering, that is not possible without giving everyone an authorized user account on gateway machines.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we discuss some general principles for attacking the prob 2 DEFINITIONS 2 lem of designing relays to satisfy both technical and policy requirements. We use our experience with constructing a relay for the X Window System <ref> [14] </ref> as a case study. After some brief definitions, we begin with discussions of traditional firewall design and administrative security policies. Next we describe our approach to building the relay for X. This is followed by short descriptions of some other example applications.

Reference-contexts: It should limit access to internal systems, but no access control beyond that is necessary. It does not transfer significant data, and an intruder would need to compromise both the NIC and an internal machine to hijack the relay. 6.4 Sup sup <ref> [15] </ref> is a software distribution program developed by the Mach project at Carnegie Mellon University.

Reference-contexts: Since we have no control over either the clients or the servers, we could not require any modifications to the software. This ruled out modifying clients and servers to use a strong authentication system such as Kerberos <ref> [16] </ref> or SPX [17]. The first problem means that we are limited at best to a solution based on IP addresses, not authenticated individuals. That immediately led us to the second problem, of ensuring that no unauthorized connections were made by other users of the remote machines. <p> Authorized user accounts satisfy this requirement. We can also satisfy the requirement by using a strong authentication system, such as Ker-beros <ref> [16] </ref>, SPX [17], or "smart cards." In fact, a system has been implemented based on the the SecureNet SNK-004 from Digital Pathways, Inc. An individual with a registered key is allowed to transfer files after authentication. Figure 4 gives a sample dialog with this service.

Reference-contexts: We use the term "router" to refer to a device that operates on packets at the network layer. A "gateway" operates at the application layer (which may encompass the OSI <ref> [18] </ref> session, presentation, and application layers). 3 Traditional Firewall Design A typical firewall configuration may consist of several computer systems. These include routers used to separate the internal and external networks as well as secure hosts that may be used for interactive use.
