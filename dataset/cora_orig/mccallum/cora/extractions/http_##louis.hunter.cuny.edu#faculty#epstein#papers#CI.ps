Reference-contexts: When students in our laboratory learn these games, they repeatedly cite small geometric arrangements of pieces as salient patterns, much like Simons chunks <ref> (Chase and Simon, 1973) </ref>. More complex games will require a more complex BPL, for example, one that would include thickness and shape for Go. An important problem, however, is to define and test for chunks in a way that minimizes the potential combinatoric explosion. <p> They summarize some of their knowledge in concepts, both as verbal memories and as chunks. A grandmasters recall is better than an ordinary persons on chess positions, but only for chess positions that are meaningful, i.e., ones that would arise during the play of a contest <ref> (Chase and Simon, 1973) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: And both of these mass-memory approaches overlook the AI objective; the intent of a game-playing program is to make decisions like an expert, not to know or remember exhaustively. Our work moves instead toward Clanceys dialectic coupling of sensorimotor systems in an ongoing sequence of coordinations <ref> (Clancey, 1993) </ref>. 6.2 Pattern-oriented Play In AI, visual cues have previously demonstrated their power as explicit search control directives and as handselected terms in an evaluation function (Gelernter, 1963; Samuel, 1963).

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 (b) is an example of such a pattern-based concept. It is the spatially-oriented heuristic reflect Os move through the center, proved to be optimal play for X in the game of lose tic-tac-toe <ref> (Cohen, 1972) </ref>. Advice from experts on how to analyze and play games is repeatedly couched in the language of such spatially-oriented patterns.

Reference-contexts: (Allard, et al., 1980; Egan and Schwartz, 1979; Engle and Bukstel, 1978; Shneiderman, 1976) .) An experts memory is organized contextually, so that a single board configuration that could arise in either of two different games is chunked and recalled differently, depending upon the game in which it is perceived <ref> (Eisenstadt and Kareev, 1975) </ref>. There is also some evidence that a limited amount of memory organization may be around prototypes, i.e., that certain situations may be reminiscent of others (Goldin, 1978; Watkins, et al., 1984) .

Reference-contexts: An Advisor outputs its recommendations in the form of comments . A comment is of the form (Advisor, action, strength) where strength is an integer from 0 to 10 that measures the intensity and direction of opinion. Further details on Hoyle are avail able in <ref> (Epstein, 1992) </ref> . 3. Learning to use and apply patterns The crux of this paper is the addition to Hoyle of pattern learning and its application in new, gamedependent third-tier Advisors. With only 22 Advisors, the program had already learned to play 18 different games extremely well. <p> It learns openings by copying them from its opponents. It learns endgame play by selective retrograde analysis, reasoning backward from some of the states experienced during play and storing the correct moves along with the significant states <ref> (Epstein, 1992) </ref> . Frequently, however, the middlegame gets murky. There may be several dozen legal moves, among which the second-tier Advisors see as many as a third as viable alternatives. <p> We do not advocate reliance on pattern-learning alone. That would ignore the other higher-level processes quite evident in humans. Indeed, Hoyle learns many other kinds of useful knowledge detailed elsewhere <ref> (Epstein, 1992) </ref> . Pattern learning is, however, an important component in skill development, one that those interested in the simulation of human intelligence or the design of adaptive game-playing programs cannot afford to ignore.

Reference-contexts: The mechanisms we describe below simulate these features. Hoyle is a program that learns to play two-person, perfect information, finite-board games. It is based on a learning and problem solving ar chitecture for skills called FORR, which employs multiple concurrent decision-making agents <ref> (Epstein, 1994a) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Empirical experience with Hoyle indicates that these weights are problem-class specific, i.e., a new item of useful knowledge to be learned. With an external model of expertise as its performance criterion, we use a perceptron-like model called AWL to learn problem-class-specific weights for the decision-making procedure <ref> (Epstein, 1994b) </ref>. Rather than tally each comment of the same strength as equivalent, AWL learns gamedependent, stagedependent weights for all second-tier and third-tier Advisors, so that, for example, two comments with the same strength would not necessarily be treated equally. <p> Without contradiction or further reinforcement, Page 18 a single outcome will remain on a waiting list that way for 459 contests, and in the cache for 4603 contests. All trials included the AWL algorithm of the preceding section <ref> (Epstein, 1994b) </ref> . Data for each game is averaged across 10 trials, and examples of consistently learned, pattern-based concepts for the three games appear in Figures 7, 8, and 9.

Reference-contexts: are more appropriately learned by other components Page 13 of the system. 3.2.1 Managing inconsistency Because a novice cannot always capitalize appropriately on its own good patterns or exploit the oppositions poor ones, the learner may initially make incorrect associations, only to find them contradicted later when it plays better <ref> (Epstein, 1994c) </ref>. Our learning algorithm therefore employs a confidence parameter to revalue responses in the face of disagreeing evidence. If a pattern is already in a cache or waiting list, but now arrives with a different nonzero response, the previous responses are multiplied by 1- confidence. <p> Hoyle learned tic-tac-toe with a behavioral standard of 10 against an external, expert, gamespecific program that played perfectly. It learned lose tic-tac-toe and five mens morris, however, with a behavioral standard of 20 and lesson and practice training <ref> (Epstein, 1994c) </ref>. In this environment (unnecessary for the easier of game tic-tac-toe), the program cycles between lessons (a set of two contests against the expert) and practice (a set of seven contests against itself).

Reference-contexts: There are several chess-playing programs that capitalize upon patterns. MACH integrates chunks, identified by human master chess players from grandmaster games, into the evaluation function of a chess program called Phoenix <ref> (George and Schaeffer, 1991) </ref> . Morph learns threat-and-defense digraphs for chess with temporal difference learning and genetic algorithms, and generalizes them, where appropriate, as features for its evaluation function (Levinson and Snyder, 1991) . HiTech uses elaborate hand-coded concepts as part of its evaluation function (Berliner, 1992) .

Reference-contexts: There is also evidence that perceptually-based schemas for geometry theorem proving support planning at a more abstract level and thereby limit search (Koedinger and Anderson, 1990) .

Pure pattern-oriented Page 24 programs learn slowly and tend to be unreliable (Boyan, 1992; Michie, 1974; Painter, 1993) . Nonetheless, many important game-playing programs have had strong, visually-oriented features in their evaluation functions (Kierulf, 1989; Lee and Mahajan, 1990; Samuel, 1963; Samuel, 1967) .

Inspection of the 12 published patterns learned by a Morph-like variant playing tic-tac-toe (Levinson, et al., 1992) shows several that are covered by Hoyle Advisors (e.g., Victory, Panic, Open, and Pitchfork).

Reference-contexts: AWL cumulatively adjusts the weights of second-tier and third-tier Advisors at the end of each contest (whether or not the third tier would actually have voted during play), and uses those weights to make decisions throughout the subsequent contest. The weights are a modification of Littlestones perceptron-like algorithm <ref> (Littlestone, 1988) </ref>. Updating during play would slow Hoyle down considerably; we massively update the weights at the end of each contest instead. 4. Results In all of the experiments described here, Hoyle alternately moved first in one contest and second in the next.

Reference-contexts: This is a non trivial task in AI <ref> (Mostow, 1983) </ref>. When there is much data or it conflicts in its potential application, as with pattern knowledge, interesting challenges arise. Each segment of the associative pattern store therefore relates differently to decision making. Patterns on the waiting list have no impact on decision making at all.

Reference-contexts: Information from these streams is combined to form a perception of the visible world (Kandel, 1991). In addition, it has been found that different parts of the brain are activated when decisions are being made about different strategic aspects of chess <ref> (Nichelli, et al., 1994) </ref> . The mechanisms we describe below simulate these features. Hoyle is a program that learns to play two-person, perfect information, finite-board games. It is based on a learning and problem solving ar chitecture for skills called FORR, which employs multiple concurrent decision-making agents (Epstein, 1994a).

Reference-contexts: The process we describe, in contrast, is able to deal with inconsistencies robustly while it focuses attention on those situations containing important visual patterns. Pell deduces higher-order reasoning agents from the rules of a game, agents which may or may not be pattern-based <ref> (Pell, 1993) </ref> . In contrast, our work induces them from playing experience .

Reference-contexts: The implementation of pattern learning and its application were inspired by repeated laboratory experiences with people, in the context of many different games. College students spoke about, reacted to, and relied upon familiar, sometimes symmetrically transposed, patterns while learning <ref> (Ratterman and Epstein, 1995) </ref>. Later, they relied heavily upon these patterns as a kind of compiled expertise. In this work, visually-perceived regularities are represented as patterns , small geometric arrangements of marker types (e.g., black, X) and unoccupied positions ( blanks) in a particular geographical location. <p> have chosen the latter for two reasons: because people are known to have visual perceptual biases for small geometric groupings (Hendee, 1993; McBurney and Collings, 1977) and the implementation of pattern learning and its application were inspired by repeated laboratory experiences with people, in the context of many different games <ref> (Ratterman and Epstein, 1995) </ref> . While T2s bias emphasizes moves later in a contest, and Morphs bias emphasizes threat and defense, our bias is toward visual patterns.

Reference-contexts: The typical game-playing program, in contrast, plays only one game and does not learn, plan, or retain its experience. Instead it uses fast, deep, sophisticated search, and a feature-based evaluation function that estimates the strength of any possible game state as a real number <ref> (Rich and Knight, 1991) </ref>. It also relies on an opening book of early move sequences favored by human experts. Often this is implemented with special-purpose hardware. The programmer selects static features that human experts hold in high regard.

Reference-contexts: There are several chess-playing programs that capitalize upon patterns. MACH integrates chunks, identified by human master chess players from grandmaster games, into the evaluation function of a chess program called Phoenix <ref> (George and Schaeffer, 1991) </ref> . Morph learns threat-and-defense digraphs for chess with temporal difference learning and genetic algorithms, and generalizes them, where appropriate, as features for its evaluation function (Levinson and Snyder, 1991) . HiTech uses elaborate hand-coded concepts as part of its evaluation function (Berliner, 1992) .

Reference-contexts: Our current research includes more sophisticated methods of learning pattern associations. It might be possible to use states preceding subgoals to provide patterns in the middle game. We are also experimenting with temporal difference learning to consider every pattern as it arises in states throughout a contest <ref> (Sutton, 1988) </ref>. Future work includes more difficult games and other kinds of templates for spatial relations (such as center, edge, perimeter, bounded regions, length, and area), and causally-based pattern generation where one or more patterns that give rise to concepts are combined to create new, larger, somewhat less regular patterns.
