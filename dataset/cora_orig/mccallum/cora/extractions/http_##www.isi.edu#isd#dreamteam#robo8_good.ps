Abstract: The Robocup 97 competition provides an excellent opportunity to demonstrate the techniques and methods of artificial intelligence, autonomous agents and computer vision. On a soccer field the core capabilities a player must have are to navigate the field, track the ball and other agents, recognize the difference between agents, collaborate with other agents, and hit the ball in the correct direction. USC/ISI RoboCup team can be described as a group of mobile autonomous agents (the players) collaborating in a rapidly changing environment (the field and opponent team). The key characteristic of the our robot soccer team is that e ach soccer robot is an autonomous agent, self-contained with all of its essential capabilities onboard. There are three types of p ositions a robot can play: goal keeper, defender and forward. The role that a robot plays on the field influences the robots perception of the environment and its playing strategy on the field. While each robot has different motivations and goals, they all share the same general architecture and basic hardware.

Reference-contexts: The drive controller stops the motion by disconnecting the move order. The car also has the capability to spin in place. There is motor for each wheel which enables its quick-turn ability. The control module is a combination of production rules and behavior-based <ref> [2] </ref> systems with each behavior represented as a set of rules [2,3]. The most important problem in this module is counterbalancing the different sources of uncertainty from environment and from the system equipment. 3.

Reference-contexts: General Architecture For this project we define an autonomous agent as an active physical entity intelligently maneuvering and performing in realistic and challenging surroundings <ref> [4] </ref>. The critical design feature of our autonomous soccer agents is that each agent has all of the its essential capabilities onboard, so that every robot is self-contained.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The Robocup task is for a team of multiple fast-moving robots to cooperatively play soccer in a dynamic environment <ref> [6] </ref>. Since teamwork and individual skills are fundamental factors in the performance of a soccer team, Robocup is a n excellent testbed for autonomous agents.

Reference-contexts: Each soccer agent receives visual input from an onboard camera. Due to its simplicity, robustness, and software availability, we have chose n Connectix Color PC QuickCam <ref> [8] </ref> as the onboard visual input hardware. This is a CCD-based camera which outputs 658x496 RGB pixels through the parallel port of the agents computer. The camera also contains a micro - controller and other electronics to control operation of the camera and pixel data transmission.

Reference-contexts: To find a valid interpretation in our large frame database we can employed any decision tree algorithm to find the needed association rules between the frame color patterns and the class of objects. In this approach we applied C4.5 <ref> [9] </ref> as the main induction method. C4.5 package generates decision trees, which provides a classification for every object within the database. The package allows the decision tree to be simplified, using a pruning technique which reduces the size of the tree according to a user-defined confidence level.
