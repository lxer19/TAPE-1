Reference-contexts: For example, in 1993 the MIT Media Laboratory developed a system for an electronic personalized newspaper, originally dubbed the Freshman Fishwrap 5 . The Fishwrap <ref> [3] </ref> (which was later made available to the entire MIT student body) claimed to make each student reader, editor, and contributor; not only did the user input the general format of newspaper he desired and select the news he would receive, but he could also submit articles (and comments on articles)

Unfortunately, MBONE's multicast protocol is extremely unportable and not viable on many systems.

Reference-contexts: Zephyr supports up to about 10 lines of 80 characters each <ref> [8] </ref> so a 700-character message was sent in a manner similar to the first trial. Again, we averaged our results over 10 trials. The results of this experiment are depicted in Figure 4-2; they do not differ significantly from the "short message, continuous conversation" test results. <p> We intentionally duplicate the format of a similar comparison chart showing similarities and differences between Zephyr and email taken from The Zephyr Notification Service <ref> [8] </ref>. 56 4.3 The Future of iFlame In this thesis we have described the iFlame protocol and implemented a demonstration communication system that used the protocol to provide a scalable and portable service. There are several directions in which that future work on iFlame could take.
