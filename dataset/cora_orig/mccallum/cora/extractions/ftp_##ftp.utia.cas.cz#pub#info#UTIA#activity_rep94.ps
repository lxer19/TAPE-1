Reference-contexts: The result contributes to completely decentralized control design methods in the case, when a local control designer has available only information on subsystem and strength of interconnection, but no overall system information. The result 25 has been presented as an invited lecture <ref> [1] </ref> and invited paper [2]. Another result concerns a new extension of the Inclusion Principle to nominally linear uncertain systems with unknown but bounded parameter uncertainties.

The result 25 has been presented as an invited lecture [1] and invited paper <ref> [2] </ref>. Another result concerns a new extension of the Inclusion Principle to nominally linear uncertain systems with unknown but bounded parameter uncertainties. Necessary and sufficient conditions for inclusion of systems and contractibility of controllers have been derived using the inclusion concept of extension for this class of systems.

Reference-contexts: problems concerning information and decision were also considered [57, 176, 228, 248, 250], as well as the non-probabilistic approach to the uncertainty based on the Kolmogorov complexity [239, 238]. 5.2 Regression analysis Robust statistical procedures for both linear and non-linear regression models, namely the M-estimates and related test, were investigated <ref> [5, 200] </ref>. In particular the sensitivity to excluding one observations was described [198, 199], which is an important robustness criterion. General problem of robustness was also discussed [259].

Reference-contexts: The Department has been active in this area for more than 25 years, covering the art from conceptual [134], theoretical [138, 139, 102], algorithmic <ref> [9, 29, 36, 103, 106, 107] </ref> and software [73, 171] aspects up to real-life applications [110, 44, 108]. Through these years it has created a unified well grounded approach to solving problems encountered in the field. <p> Enhanced stress on interplay between theory and computing power [96, 132] is the key characteristic of the present research activities. In this way, the addressed problems move from the design oriented for single-input single-output linear systems to multi-input multi-output <ref> [9] </ref> and/or non-linear cases [134, 137]. It is impossible to give a full account on results reflected in more than 70 papers and working reports, in chains of seminars, in discussions with partners in academe and applied sectors. <p> LQ Optimization with Irregular Input-Output Sampling. The standard linear quadratic (LQ) optimization requires a rigid state space description of the system. A new algorithmic realization of the dynamic programming <ref> [9] </ref> makes it possible to per 51 form LQ optimization with input/output models whose struc-ture may vary. Instead of the explicit solution available for a fixed linear system description, the underlying implicit sequence of time updates and loss minimizations is implemented, controlled by incoming data (event driven).

Reference-contexts: Two basic approaches are reviewed and the conditions under which they should be used are specified. 23 2.2 Multidimensional Inference Mechanism for the Pro- babilistic Expert System PES A new approach has been suggested to handle the problems of extreme dimensionality in probabilistic expert systems <ref> [32] </ref>. The method makes use of an idea originally designed for multivariate pattern recognition and is particularly useful for data-oriented knowledge base design.

Reference-contexts: However, this form of publication is rather awkward and the necessary protection measures against misuse of individual data are questionable. In this context a new alternative solution of this problem has been suggested which is based on the methods of artificial intelligence. The statistical model of Prague households <ref> [33] </ref> has been esti 24 mated to demonstrate the possibility of interactive presentation of the statistical properties of large and/or confidential data sets by means of the probabilistic expert system PES. <p> The estimation techniques in regression models for intensity of counting process and hazard regression models were developed and compared with the standard procedures [260, 261, 262]. 61 The problem whether a given estimator belongs to the class of M-estimators was also solved [237], as well as some applied statistical problems <ref> [33] </ref>. 5.3 Random Processes and Fields The approximate ML-estimate was derived for the case of general random process [246]. For Gibbs random fields the properties of statistical procedures, in particular these based on the pseudo-likelihood ratio, were studied [55, 56, 58, 59]. Some of the results were summarized [62].

Reference-contexts: A particular attention has been paid to the Hellinger and Kol-mogorov distances. The Kolmogorov distance leads to the possibility to increase the rate of consistency to n 1=2 from the previously established level n 2=5 <ref> [34, 35, 249] </ref>. Necessary and sufficient conditions for consistency of maximum likelihood estimates have also been established [145, 247]. An alternative method of statistical estimation and decision based on minimizing the entropy of error was introduced and studied [60, 61].

Reference-contexts: Practical implementation of the developed controllers needs, however, computer aid for the overall design procedure [171, 172]. For demanding situations, use of available prior information proved to be helpful in many cases <ref> [96, 97, 98, 173, 37] </ref>. In the recent years, much effort was devoted to overall aspects of the adaptive control implementation, in order to complete the chain of theoretical [94, 95, 96, 173] as well as algorithmic [77, 78, 82] tasks included.

Reference-contexts: In this respect, it is similar to the Givens rotation and the Hyperbolic rotation. Since the pseudo-Givens rotation can be used to limit fill-in in structured matrices, one use of the pseudo-Givens rotation is to reduce such matrices to banded form. A algorithm was proposed in <ref> [38] </ref> to provide a more efficient matrix-based method with which to compute the roots of polynomial. This is accomplished by taking advantage of the structure of the com 38 panion matrix.

Reference-contexts: The periodic Schur decomposition has been generally seen as a tool to compute the eigenvalues of a product of matrices in a numerically sound way. In a recent paper <ref> [39] </ref>, it was shown that the periodic Schur decomposition may also be used to accurately compute the quotient singular value decomposition (QSVD) of a sequence of matrix pairs.

In the two-by-two case, this matrix is the pseudo-Givens rotation <ref> [40] </ref>, which has the following properties. First, it zeros an element in an arbitrary column vector from the left, while its inverse zeros an element in an arbitrary row vector from the right.

Reference-contexts: Finally, since the algorithm uses many standard matrix techniques, it lends itself to classical error analysis of numerical linear algebra. This research was supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic - 102/94/0294. 3.9 Entropic Identification An analogy was made in a recent paper <ref> [41] </ref> between an entropic identification scheme proposed by Klan and an identification scheme based on an under-determined least-squares formulation.

Reference-contexts: The former ones were investigated, among other older works, in [196], where the Pontryagin maximum principle has been shown to be equivalent with the simple first-order optimality condition. The latter ones were treated, e.g., in <ref> [51, 197] </ref>, where many results concerning selective optimality conditions, numerical approximation, uniqueness, and continuous dependence for the relaxed variational problems has been obtained in the scalar case. The vectorial variational problems, representing a qualitatively more difficult task, were addressed in [194, 195] and presently numerical experiments are carried out.

Reference-contexts: Available clinical data enabled additional cross-check of tested mechanisms. In this way it was possible to simulate CD4 + dynamics after depletion of CD8 + lymphocytes by antibodies. Even one simulated administration of anti-CD8 antibodies increases the CD4 + lymphocyte counts and prolongs the patient survival <ref> [53] </ref>. However, if cells involved in protective immunity are assumed to belong to the CD8 + category, anti-CD8 antibodies accelerate the decrease of CD4 + cells and shorten thus the patient survival.

Reference-contexts: For demanding situations, use of available prior information proved to be helpful in many cases [96, 97, 98, 173, 37].

Enhanced stress on interplay between theory and computing power [96, 132] is the key characteristic of the present research activities. <p> Recently proposed methodology of Bayesian pooling of imprecise, repetitive and incompletely compatible information [98, 97] has been refined and successfully applied to problems of mixing simpler ARX or Markov models [100, 106, 107, 104, 105, 179] and their recursive conservative estimation <ref> [94, 104] </ref>. The approach was used to prior information treating in the adaptive control and its positive contribution to the tuning of adaptive controllers has been confirmed through extensive simulation studies [173]. The common methodological root can be sketched as follows.

If this is a polytope then we can solve the problem by attending to the corners.

Reference-contexts: Enhanced stress on interplay between theory and computing power [96, 132] is the key characteristic of the present research activities. In this way, the addressed problems move from the design oriented for single-input single-output linear systems to multi-input multi-output [9] and/or non-linear cases <ref> [134, 137] </ref>. It is impossible to give a full account on results reflected in more than 70 papers and working reports, in chains of seminars, in discussions with partners in academe and applied sectors. <p> The discussed methodology combined with a novel formulation of control design [102] opens a way to a new generation of adaptive controllers for non-linear complex processes.

Reference-contexts: Substantial progress has been achieved in tuning of PID-family controllers. Using a special type of nonlinearity A fl sign (B) makes the terms of a PID controller inherently adaptive to varying time scale so that the only parameter to be adjusted (automatically or manually) is the common gain <ref> [159] </ref>. A portable PID tuning advisor [108] has been elaborated. The instrument evaluates the dynamic behaviour of a closed loop control process under normal operation conditions and displays values of the control parameters to be adjusted. No additional test disturbances need be applied.

Reference-contexts: The influence of geometric transformations to the positional accuracy has been studied. An overdetermined transformation model is solved by means of the Bayesian method 72 (see <ref> [219] </ref>). Different degrees of identity of the control points can be considered. The uncertainty of the position of the points is supposed to be given in form of a probability distribution, which need not be necessarily normal.

Reference-contexts: Namely three frameworks are suitable for this study: probabilistic reasoning, theory of relational databases and Spohn's theory of deterministic epistemology. In <ref> [221] </ref> it was shown that in the framework of Spohn's theory, named also kappa-calculus in AI community, there exists no finite complete axiomatic characterization of formal properties of conditional independence. <p> Nevertheless, the marginal problem is possible to study in all five calculi mentioned. In [224], <ref> [221] </ref> 14 it was shown that the so-called running intersection property is a necessary and sufficient condition for pairwise compatibility of less-dimensional knowledge representation being equivalent to their global consistency i.e. to the existence of a global knowledge representation having the prescribed less-dimensional knowledge representations as marginals.

Reference-contexts: For each number of variables there exists an inference rule (valid in Spohn's theory) which cannot be applied for lower number of variables and is not derivable from such other inference rules. As explained in a former work <ref> [223] </ref> the concept of conditional independence can be studied also in the framework of possibility theory and Dempster-Shafer's theory of evidence but so far has not been clarified what is the right concept of conditional independence within these two frameworks.

Reference-contexts: A typical problem of this sort, robust asymptotic performance design, has been studied recently and several design methods have been proposed that are based on polynomial techniques <ref> [233, 234] </ref>. Each of the the design methods gives rise to a robust two-degrees-of-freedom controller. The controller transfer functions result from the solution of a couple of linear equations in polynomials with coefficients depending on the plant parameters.

Reference-contexts: This is exactly the aim of the new joint project. Thus far, a package of MATLAB macros has been developed for three existing numerical procedures solving the equation (interpolation, elementary operations and state-space realization). Then the algorithms have been tested, evaluated and compared in experimental manner <ref> [235] </ref>. Thousands of examples have been computed covering both generic (randomly created) data and ill-conditioned cases (with "almost common factors"). The most successful method in the triple appears to be the one based on interpolation.
