Abstract: This is a basic course in automated learning covering the theory, algorithms, and applications. The prerequisites are Ma 2 and CS 2, or equivalent (familiarity with basic math and computer programming). The course work will include homeworks, computer experiments, and (in the second term) a course project. The course outline is as follows (since this is the first time the course is offered, the outline is adaptive).
