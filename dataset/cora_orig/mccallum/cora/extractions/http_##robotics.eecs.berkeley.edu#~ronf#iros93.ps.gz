Title: Sensing Capabilities of Linear Elastic Cylindrical Fingers  
Author: Edward J. Nicolson and Ronald S. Fearing 
Address: Berkeley, CA 94720  
Affiliation: Department of EE&CS University of California  
Abstract: A linear elastic plane strain model for a cylindrical finger with a solid core and elastic surface is developed. This model is used to determine the subsurface strain impulse responses as well as pressure distributions in the contact region for indentation of the cylinder by rigid objects with friction. Singular value decomposition is used to find a reduced basis in which to analyze the shape-from-strain inversion problem. This decomposition shows that sensor depth must be small to achieve good shape sensing. However, if only contact location and applied force magnitude and direction are required, deep sensors can quickly and easily provide this information.

In these cases the elastic half-space model is appropriate.

Reference-contexts: Most recently [Ellis 92] has used a finite element model to investigate the effect of a cylindrical geometry on subsurface strain data. Their conclusions, that shape interpretation is difficult due to the high degree of similarity of subsurface strain profiles, are supported by this paper. <ref> [Canepa et.al.] </ref> describe a neural net approach to inverting tactile sensor data. They discuss the low pass filtering effect of the rubber and the resulting limitation on shape discrimination. They point out that the shapes recognized must be restricted to those that are represented by low frequencies.

Reference-contexts: This paper develops a model specifically for cylindrical geometries and compares the predicted subsurface strain response to that of the half space model. In <ref> [Fearing 85] </ref> it is shown how the linear elastic half space model can be used to determine contact location, shape, and force from subsurface normal strain data on a cylindrical finger. One of the open questions was the effect of the cylindrical geometry on the subsurface strain. <p> Figures 3 and 4 also show the comparable frequency and impulse response for the plane strain half plane model <ref> [Johnson 85, Fearing 85] </ref>. The plots have been normalized to the peak value. In both figures the response due to normal and tangential loading has been separated to show the relative effect of normal and tangential loads on the normal and shear strain.

Given the sensor parameters of <ref> [Fearing 90] </ref> it would be very difficult to sense the odd part of the 7 shape since, as Figure 3 shows, that information will be filtered out. <p> For good shape discrimination the sensors must be put close to the surface, at ff &gt; 0:85, or the sensors must be highly noise free and accurate to at least 1 percent to detect the high frequency information. A sensor is being constructed based on the design of <ref> [Fearing 90] </ref> to test the validity of this model. We expect to find that localization and detection of force magnitude and direction will be fast and well posed.
