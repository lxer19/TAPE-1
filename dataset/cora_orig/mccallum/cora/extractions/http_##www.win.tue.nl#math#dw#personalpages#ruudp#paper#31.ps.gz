Reference-contexts: The application of this algorithm to the decoding problem was made in [51] and the inclusion of the majority voting is from [87, 88, 89]. The algorithm was implemented in [65] for the Hermitian curve over F 2 8 and a general implementation was carried out in <ref> [1] </ref>. In [55, 60] a generalization of Forneys formula is presented for the calculation of the error values. The formula in Section 7.2 is from [88]. Usually one can apply a fast Fourier-like transform to speed up this part of the decoding.

Reference-contexts: The symbols in codewords of C (D; G) are elements of F 8 which we interpret as column vectors of length 3 over F 2 and then we adjoin the parity check. The resulting code C is a binary <ref> [92; 24; 26] </ref> code. The punctured code, a [91; 24; 25] code set a new world record for codes with n = 91, d = 25. Example 2.76 We show how to construct a generator matrix for the code of the previous example. We consider the functions x=z and y=z. <p> This can be proved with the theory of Grobner bases for which we refer to the literature mentioned in the Notes. 3.3 Notes The approach given in this and the next section is new.

The idea to define ~ C (d) by deleting parity checks in the definition of C l and still keeping the same bound on the minimum distance is from [25], where they are called improved geometric Goppa codes.
