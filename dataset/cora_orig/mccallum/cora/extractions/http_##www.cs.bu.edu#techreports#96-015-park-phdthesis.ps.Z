Reference-contexts: Remarks 1.2.4 1. In finite Markov chains, speed of convergence to equilibrium can be measured by the second-largest eigenvalue 2 of a certain matrix; i.e., the relaxation time can be estimated by 1=(1 2 ) (see, e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>). In certain reversible Markov chains arising in combinatorial optimization, the quantity called "conductance" was found useful for estimating 1 2 [28]. The exponential growth in m of the relaxation time of the above systems means therefore that their 2 is exponentially close to 1. 2. <p> Theorem 1.4.2 There exist 0 &lt; fi fl &lt; fi fl &lt; 1 such that 8fi 2 <ref> [0; fi fl ) [ (fi fl ; 1] </ref>, 8" 2 (0; 1], K ";fi and L ";fi are mixing. The strong bias is a weak point since it does not preclude the possibility that for fi 1=2, K ";fi and L ";fi are nonergodic. <p> Theorem 1.4.2 There exist 0 &lt; fi fl &lt; fi fl &lt; 1 such that 8fi 2 [0; fi fl ) <ref> [ (fi fl ; 1] </ref>, 8" 2 (0; 1], K ";fi and L ";fi are mixing. The strong bias is a weak point since it does not preclude the possibility that for fi 1=2, K ";fi and L ";fi are nonergodic. <p> Experiments in [4] let the authors conjecture that for some "-perturbations L " of L, the log relaxation time is (1=").

Reference-contexts: The search for nonergodic one-dimensional rules was much slower in coming with an interesting candidate rule introduced by Gacs, Kurdyumov, and Levin in 1978 called the soldiers rule <ref> [9] </ref>. Due to a certain self-stabilization property, the authors conjectured that a probabilistic perturbation of the rule was nonergodic. In the continuous time community, a conjecture had arisen which stated that all translation-invariant, finite-range systems with positive 4 transition rates were ergodic, also known as the positive rates conjecture [14]. <p> Two configurations ~ 1 , ~ 2 are called equivalent with respect to T if there is a t 0 such that T t (~ 1 ) = T t (~ 2 ). In <ref> [9] </ref>, a configuration ~ is called attractive if every other configuration with f x : ~(x) 6= (x) g finite, is equivalent to it. We add the requirement that ~ be invariant. We call a transition function conservative if it has non-equivalent periodic attractive configurations. <p> Toom defined conservative transition rules with state set f0; 1g whose attractive configurations are the constant configurations 0 , 1 . These rules can also be viewed as monotonic Boolean functions. An example is the north-east-center voting rule also known as Toom's rule. In <ref> [9] </ref> some conservative one-dimensional cellular automata were constructed. The simplest example, denoted by L and called the soldiers rule or GKL rule after the originators Gacs, Kurdyumov, and Levin, is described as follows. There are two states labeled 1 and 1.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the mixing property holds for any positive error probability " &gt; 0, and the bias assumption makes it possible 17 to apply "renormalization" methods used earlier in the opposite context of proving fault-tolerance <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> The precise notion of "largely 11" is called k-black.

Reference-contexts: In the continuous time community, a conjecture had arisen which stated that all translation-invariant, finite-range systems with positive 4 transition rates were ergodic, also known as the positive rates conjecture [14]. This conjecture was disproved in discrete time by Gacs in the early 1980's <ref> [11] </ref> using a complicated hierarchical construction based on some ideas of Kurdyumov [21]. The continuous time version has been recently advanced in [13]. A non-uniform solution (i.e., non-uniform in both space and time) was given earlier by Zirelson [37]. <p> The monotonicity property turns out to be inessential to our arguments.

Some form of hierarchical behavior seems necessary for non-ergodic one-dimensional cellular automata to overcome the volatility of simple conservative rules in the presence of random errors outlined above.

Reference-contexts: Continuous time systems require the machinery of Markov generators to account for nontrivial existence problems whereas for discrete time systems this is much simpler. However, the analysis of discrete time systems has tended to be much more challenging than their continuous time counterparts (cf. local majority voting <ref> [14, 15] </ref>) due to the need to track events simultaneously. Significant progress toward exhibiting nonergodic discrete time media in dimension 2 and higher was made by Toom in the 1970's where several rules were introduced with a proof of nonergodicity [31]. <p> Due to a certain self-stabilization property, the authors conjectured that a probabilistic perturbation of the rule was nonergodic.

In the continuous-time context, Gray proved that these rules are mixing <ref> [14] </ref>. <p> To measure these finer differences we use relaxation time. It is easy to see that if V is a local voting rule and V " any of its "-perturbations, then Relax (n; %; V " ) = ((1=") 2 ). It is possible to deduce from the proofs in <ref> [14] </ref>, [15] that in continuous time, if V " is any "-perturbation of a local voting rule V with noise lower bound ", then Relax (n; %; V " ) = O ((1=") 2 ). <p> The interpretation should be clear from the context. 21 2.2 Spreading of agreement and blackishness It is not too difficult to prove the following fact (see, e.g., <ref> [14] </ref>): Proposition 2.2.1 If there is a ffi 1 &gt; 0 such that 8n 2 N , 9t 0 &gt; 0, 8t &gt; t 0 Pr ( 0 (x; t) = 1 (x; t); n x n) &gt; ffi 1 ; (2.2.2) then K ";fi is mixing.

The discrete time case is technically more difficult but Gray has outlined a proof of the mixing property for local majority voting in <ref> [15] </ref>. 1.4 New results This thesis is a contribution in the direction of showing that one-dimensional rules, without some form of hierarchical behavior, fail to conserve information. We define a special perturbation K ";fi of the rule K, for 0 fi 1 as follows. <p> It is easy to see that if V is a local voting rule and V " any of its "-perturbations, then Relax (n; %; V " ) = ((1=") 2 ).

First, for all x; t, j = 1; 1, we independently toss a coin E x;t;j which is 0 with probability 1 " and 1 with probability ". This is followed by a coin B x;t;j which is 1 with probability 1 fi and 0 with probability fi.

Reference-contexts: The north-east-center rule, also known as Toom's rule, is a well-known example. Toom's nonergodicity proof was an extension of a general technique called the contour argument, a widely used tool in interacting particle systems which goes back to Peierls' investigation of phase transitions in the two-dimensional Ising model <ref> [26] </ref>. The search for nonergodic one-dimensional rules was much slower in coming with an interesting candidate rule introduced by Gacs, Kurdyumov, and Levin in 1978 called the soldiers rule [9]. Due to a certain self-stabilization property, the authors conjectured that a probabilistic perturbation of the rule was nonergodic.

Reference-contexts: Other significant work on information storage in the context of the circuit model was done by, among others, 1 2 Kuznietsov [22] and more recently Sipser and Spielman <ref> [29] </ref>. Although the circuit model is appealing due to the simple and well-understood nature of fault-tolerant computing, a potential drawback is its reliance on lengthy wires needed for satisfying expansion properties in the construction of compressors.

Reference-contexts: Cellular automata have also been investigated as models of "complex systems," but due to their universality, most questions regarding their asymptotic behavior turn out to be undecidable. An interesting collection of papers may be found in [17, 36]. A practical introduction to cellular automata is given in <ref> [30] </ref>. Related to the topic of cellular automata as models of physical and biological 3 systems, particle systems have been studied in physics in connection with characterizing their global properties, in particular, with respect to the existence of phase transitions.

Reference-contexts: Significant progress toward exhibiting nonergodic discrete time media in dimension 2 and higher was made by Toom in the 1970's where several rules were introduced with a proof of nonergodicity <ref> [31] </ref>. The north-east-center rule, also known as Toom's rule, is a well-known example. Toom's nonergodicity proof was an extension of a general technique called the contour argument, a widely used tool in interacting particle systems which goes back to Peierls' investigation of phase transitions in the two-dimensional Ising model [26].

Reference-contexts: Nonergodic noisy cellular automata were first constructed by Andre Toom in the mid 1970's <ref> [32] </ref>. These automata had dimension 2. Toom's conservative 2-dimensional north-east-center voting is one such example.

Reference-contexts: We prove the same results for a rule suggested recently by Toom called two-line voting <ref> [33] </ref>. This rule is similar to the soldiers rule with respect to the deterministic self-stabilization property (also called the eroder property), but is a little easier to handle due to its coordinate-wise monotonicity. <p> In this thesis, we study the behavior of the GKL rule and a rule recently suggested by Toom which is similar to L in its important properties, but a little easier to handle due to its monotonicity. The new rule is called two-line voting <ref> [33] </ref> and is denoted by K. The new set of states is S = f0; 1g 2 and we represent a state as a 2-element bit array indexed by 1; 1. The bottom bit of state s is s (1), the top bit is s (1).

Reference-contexts: Introduction The foundations of cellular automata and fault-tolerant computation go back to von Neumann whose seminal works <ref> [34, 35] </ref> have played a significant role in establishing both research areas. In theoretical fault-tolerant computing, a computing model is defined and its behavior is investigated when certain components of the model are allowed to fail. <p> All of the subsequent discussion including the contribution of this thesis deals with transient faults. Von Neumann's formulation was done in the context of the Boolean circuit model and a positive answer to the fault-tolerance question was given by von Neumann in <ref> [34] </ref>. It was later improved by Dobrushin and Ortyukov [6] who showed an upper bound of m = O (n log n). The logarithmic redundancy factor was proven to be tight in [5].

Reference-contexts: Introduction The foundations of cellular automata and fault-tolerant computation go back to von Neumann whose seminal works <ref> [34, 35] </ref> have played a significant role in establishing both research areas. In theoretical fault-tolerant computing, a computing model is defined and its behavior is investigated when certain components of the model are allowed to fail. <p> Hence, if possible, it is preferable to have a uniform yet local connectivity structure that only requires constant length wires for connected elements. Cellular automata are computing models that satisfy this property. Cellular automata were introduced by von Neumann in conjunction with investigating the problem of self-reproducing machines <ref> [35] </ref>. An introduction to self-reproducing machines and its main results can be found in [2].
