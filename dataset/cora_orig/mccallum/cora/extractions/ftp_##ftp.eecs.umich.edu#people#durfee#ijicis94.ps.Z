Abstract: Cooperative information agents need mechanisms that enable them to work together effectively while solving common problems. We investigate the use of commitment by agents to proposed actions as a mechanism that allow agents to work concurrently on interdependent problems. Judicious use of commitment can not only increase the throughput of cooperative information systems, but also allow them to deal flexibly with dynamically changing environments. We use the domain of distributed scheduling to demonstrate that static commitment strategies are ineffective. Results from simulated experiments are used to identify the environmental features on which an adaptive commitment strategy should be predicated.

Reference-contexts: In fact, it has been 3 shown that commitment can be used even by non-cooperative (antagonistic) agents to gain advantage in hostile negotiations [3, 9]. In cooperative settings, however, reciprocal commitments enable quicker convergence in multiagent negotiations when compared to unilateral commitments. Cohen and Levesque <ref> [1] </ref> have developed the semantics associated with committing to a particular set of actions. Jennings [4], on the other hand, emphasizes the centrality of commitment in coordinating multiple agents. The latter work also concerns the use of conventions as a guide to reasoning when agents fail to honor their commitments.

Reference-contexts: Scheduling processes Our scheduling agents handle the demand of concurrent scheduling of multiple tasks by creating a process for each such task. The different concurrently active processes, forked by managers of different resources required by a task, negotiate using the multistage negotiation protocol <ref> [2] </ref>, an extension of the contract-net protocol [13]. Each scheduling agent manages the calendar accesses by the different processes it has forked. We do not concern ourselves with concurrency control mechanisms, assuming the availability of standard database or file access control mechanisms [5, 8].

Reference-contexts: Each scheduling agent manages the calendar accesses by the different processes it has forked. We do not concern ourselves with concurrency control mechanisms, assuming the availability of standard database or file access control mechanisms <ref> [5, 8] </ref>. A given task t i is scheduled through negotiation by jA i j processes, one for each of the resources required for the task. The process created by the agent managing the jth resource to schedule task i is referred to as T ij .

Reference-contexts: This necessitates a thorough investigation of different heuristic strategies for commitment that an automated agent can use. It is necessary that we clarify what we mean by the term commitment. We assume the following definition of the term <ref> [6] </ref>: Definition: Commitment is an agreement or pledge to do something in the future. An agent can make such a pledge to itself, or to another agent. In this paper, we will concern ourselves with the decision regarding whether or not to commit to proposed times to schedule an activity.

Reference-contexts: If all tasks are known ahead of time or new task arrivals are spaced far apart, number of resources required per task is very small, or resource managers agree to share all information without any restriction, a more traditional, centralized scheduling approach <ref> [7] </ref> should be preferred. We would like to extend this work in two important directions: (i) For the distributed scheduling domain, we want to investigate more opportunistic commitment strategies, where a proposed interval will be proposed for another task only if the utility to do so is higher.

Reference-contexts: For each of these, and the resultant matrix, we are describing qualitative intervals, 11 schedule densities and task arrival rates (10 agents, 14 day calendars, 9 hrs/day). although a more thorough quantitative analysis of the impact of these factors is possible <ref> [10] </ref>. Success probability for proposed interval: This factor measures the probability of success that the proposed interval will be free in the calendar of every resource manager, and hence can be used to schedule the task. We will con sider cases of high and low success probability.

Environmental factors influencing commitment decisions The following are some of the most important environmental factors that can be used to guide the choice of commitment strategies in an automated scheduling agent.

Reference-contexts: We assume a dynamic environment where tasks arrive over time. This problem is more difficult than the static scheduling problem where all tasks are available before processing starts <ref> [14] </ref>. Furthermore, we require the same task be processed using multiple resources to be acquired from different sources. This is considerably more problematic than the situation where each task can be processed by using just one resource. 4.
