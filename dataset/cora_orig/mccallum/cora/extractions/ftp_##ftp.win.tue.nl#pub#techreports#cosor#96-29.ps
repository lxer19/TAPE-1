Abstract: In this paper we investigate the robustness of the preference threshold procedure, introduced by Verheijen, Coolen and Van der Laan [5], with respect to deviations from the normality assumption. The preference threshold procedure is a combination of the standard indifference zone selection and the subset selection, the two standard approaches for statistical selection. In a number of simulation studies, the preference threshold procedure is applied on populations coming from Normal, Logistic, Laplace, Weibull, Gamma and Lognormal distributions. We compare the results on basis of the observed number of correct selections.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we simulate experiments in which we apply the preference threshold procedure as designed for normal populations, but where we take observations from different distributed populations, namely from Logistic, Laplace, Weibull, Gamma and Lognormal distributed populations. Driessen, Van der Laan and Van Putten <ref> [2] </ref> considered the problem of a violation of the assumption of common known variance for both the indifference zone selection and the subset selection. <p> Realisations of Y ij are denoted by y ij .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Selecting the best out of k ( 2) populations is a problem which often occurs in practical situations. Verheijen, Coolen and Van der Laan <ref> [5] </ref> present a new procedure to handle this problem. Their procedure, called the preference threshold procedure, is a combination of two standard approaches, the indifference zone selection of Bechhofer [1] and the subset selection of Gupta [3]. <p> Driessen, Van der Laan and Van Putten [2] considered the problem of a violation of the assumption of common known variance for both the indifference zone selection and the subset selection. This is used by Verheijen, Coolen and Van der Laan <ref> [5] </ref> who investigated the robustness of the preference threshold procedure with regard to deviations from this assumption. More details about the preference threshold procedure and its properties can be found in Verheijen [4]. <p> In section 4 we explain the way the simulations were carried out. The actual simulation studies are presented in section 5. Finally, in section 6, some conclusions are drawn. 2 Preference threshold procedure We consider the preference threshold procedure as presented by Verheijen, Coolen and Van der Laan <ref> [5] </ref>. This procedure combines the two standard approaches of statistical selection by introducing a preference threshold c 0. We take samples of common size n &gt; 0 of each population and denote the jth observation taken from population i by Y ij , Y ij i.i.d. per population i . <p> We have (<ref> [5] </ref>) n = oe (o 1 + o 2 ) 2 oe 2 2 o 2 Values for o 1 and o 2 can be found from table 1 (reproduced from [5]), for different values of P fl and Q fl , respectively. To satisfy both requirements in practice, we have to take the nearest higher integer value for the sample size if n is not an integer.
