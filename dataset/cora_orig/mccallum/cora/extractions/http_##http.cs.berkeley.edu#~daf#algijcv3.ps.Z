Title: Recognizing Algebraic Surfaces from their Outlines  
Author: D. A. Forsyth 
Date: January 5, 1995  
Address: Berkeley, CA 94720

Abstract: The outline in a single picture of a generic algebraic surface of degree three or greater completely determines the projective geometry of the surface. The result holds for a generic perspective view of a generic algebraic surface, where the camera calibration parameters and the focal point are unknown. Known camera calibration appears not to reduce the projective ambiguity. The result is constructive. Keywords: Recognition, Computer Vision, Algebraic Surfaces, Invariant Theory, Outlines.

Reference-contexts: These singularities are the key to obtaining the contour generator from the outline; fortunately, they are highly structured. Generically there are only cusps and nodes. The following results have been known since at least the late 19th century (see, for example, <ref> [1] </ref>). 2.1.1 Cusps A cusp in the outline is a local event on the contour generator, so that cusps are relatively easily studied; a cusp occurs when the contour generator is tangent to the ray through the focal point (see, for example, [16] for this widely known result).

Each approach has characteristic disadvantages; extensions to line labelling and aspect graphs can be extremely complicated for even simple curved surfaces (examples in [27, 33, 34]), constraint-based systems must search a model-base, and studies of differential properties seldom yield sufficient information to identify a surface.

Reference-contexts: At this point, we assume that the surface is smooth and irreducible. The result is similar to that independently obtained by <ref> [5] </ref>, who demonstrated necessary and sufficient conditions for a curve to be an outline, but did not show that an outline determines a surface. Note that the theorem is trival for surfaces of degree two, as generic surfaces of degree 2 are all projectively equivalent. <p> The constraints that singularities lie on curves of particular degrees determine the family of curves that are generic outlines of smooth surfaces, according to an result of <ref> [5] </ref> which states that: Theorem: (D'Almeida) Let be a plane curve of degree n (n 1), n 3.

Reference-contexts: As a result, an important part of the problem involves constructing as large a class of surfaces as possible that can either be directly recognised or usefully constrained, from their outline alone.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, camera parameters must be known to predict the outline correctly. 1.2 Indexing for recognition A number of recent papers have shown how indexing can be used to avoid searching a model base (e.g. <ref> [7, 19, 35, 39, 45] </ref>). Objects are indexed by computing descriptions that are unaffected by the position and intrinsic parameters of the camera, and that differ from object to object. <p> However, no searching of the model base is required because the hypothesised object's identity is determined by the invariant descriptors measured. Systems of this sort have been demonstrated for plane objects in a number of papers <ref> [7, 19, 36, 40, 46, 48] </ref>. These systems are attractive because, in the ideal case, an object description is computed from the image and identifies the object, without requiring that a model base be searched. As a result, systems with relatively large model bases can be constructed 2 .

Recently, there have been attempts to represent the system of outlines of a curved surface as a linear combination of outlines (see, for example, [42]). <p> In this context, studies have focused on rotationally symmetric surfaces (for example, [6, 8]), and straight homogenous generalised cylinders (for example, [2, 28, 43, 44, 47]). Recently, Ponce and Kriegman <ref> [29, 30, 31, 32, 33] </ref> focussed attention on algebraic surfaces.

Reference-contexts: from images, including attempts to extend line labelling to curved shapes (e.g. [10, 20]), the development of constraint-based systems (e.g. [3]), the study of how the topology of a surface's outline changes as it is viewed from different points, formalised into a structure known as an aspect graph (for example, <ref> [16, 17, 26, 33, 34] </ref>), and studies of the relationship between the differential geometry of the outline and that of the surface, both for single images (e.g. [17, 18, 21]) and for motion sequences (e.g. [4, 11]). <p> Each approach has characteristic disadvantages; extensions to line labelling and aspect graphs can be extremely complicated for even simple curved surfaces (examples in <ref> [27, 33, 34] </ref>), constraint-based systems must search a model-base, and studies of differential properties seldom yield sufficient information to identify a surface. Recently, there have been attempts to represent the system of outlines of a curved surface as a linear combination of outlines (see, for example, [42]).

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, camera parameters must be known to predict the outline correctly. 1.2 Indexing for recognition A number of recent papers have shown how indexing can be used to avoid searching a model base (e.g. <ref> [7, 19, 35, 39, 45] </ref>). Objects are indexed by computing descriptions that are unaffected by the position and intrinsic parameters of the camera, and that differ from object to object.

Reference-contexts: However, no searching of the model base is required because the hypothesised object's identity is determined by the invariant descriptors measured. Systems of this sort have been demonstrated for plane objects in a number of papers <ref> [7, 19, 36, 40, 46, 48] </ref>. These systems are attractive because, in the ideal case, an object description is computed from the image and identifies the object, without requiring that a model base be searched. As a result, systems with relatively large model bases can be constructed 2 .

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, any indexing function should be both invariant and computable from outline information alone. Indexing functions with these properties have been demonstrated for polyhedra <ref> [37] </ref>, and for rotationally symmetric surfaces [8].

Reference-contexts: The singularities of the outline all have multiplicity two, and are those points (u 0 ; u 1 ; u 2 ) where S and @S @u 3 have two common roots in u 3 . The equations yielding these points can be obtained using a technique from Salmon <ref> [38] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Recently, there have been attempts to represent the system of outlines of a curved surface as a linear combination of outlines (see, for example, <ref> [42] </ref>). This approach is represented as providing an approximation sufficiently accurate for some purposes, although it cannot capture all the complexities of the outline.
