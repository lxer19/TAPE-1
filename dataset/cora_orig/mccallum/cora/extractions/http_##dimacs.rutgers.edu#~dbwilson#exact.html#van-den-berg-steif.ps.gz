Abstract: We study the existence of finitary codings (also called finitary ho-momorphisms or finitary factor maps) from a finite-valued i.i.d. process to certain random fields. For Markov random fields we show, using ideas of Marton and Shields, that the presence of a phase transition is an obstruction for the existence of the above coding: this yields a large class of Bernoulli shifts for which no such coding exists. Conversely, we show that for the stationary distribution of a monotone exponentially ergodic probabilistic cellular automaton such a coding does exist. The construction of the coding is partially inspired by the Propp-Wilson algorithm for exact simulation. In particular, combining our results with a theorem of Martinelli and Olivieri, we obtain the fact that for the plus state for the ferromagnetic Ising model on Z d , d 2, there is (not) such a coding when the interaction parameter is below (above) its critical value. fl Part of this research done while participating, with financial support from Rutgers University, in the DIMACS program on Discrete Probability in the spring of 1997 and while participating, with financial support from the Stochastic Centre at Chalmers University of Technology, in the program on Percolation, Particle Systems and Ergodic Theory in the fall of 1997

Reference-contexts: Processes which are isomorphic to i.i.d. processes are called Bernoulli shifts. It was also proved by Ornstein (see [30]) that a factor of an i.i.d. process is a Bernoulli shift. Prior to [30], isomorphisms between certain classes of i.i.d. processes were obtained (see <ref> [4] </ref> and [28]). These mappings had the advantage of being fini-tary. A coding is called finitary if it is continuous after removing some set of measure 0. There is another more natural equivalent definition of finitary in this context (which also explains the word finitary).

Reference-contexts: Proof of Theorem 2.1: It is proved in [27] that finitary codings preserve the blowing-up property in 1-d. The proof of this result goes through step by step to d 2 dimensions. It is proved in <ref> [8] </ref> that a 1-d i.i.d. process satisfies the blowing-up property. This result for 1-d immediately yields the same fact for higher dimensions.

Reference-contexts: This gives our first counter-example, as mentioned above. What is happening here is that there may be nontranslation invariant Markov random fields (even nonperiodic Markov random fields can exist, e.g., the Ising model in 3 dimensions (see <ref> [9] </ref>)) and one needs to know whether the unique translation invariant Markov random field that one is looking at is extremal within the class of all Markov random fields with the given conditional probabilities, not just within the class of the translation invariant ones.

Reference-contexts: Next, as far as the second property of "exponential rate of convergence property for frequencies", a measure which is the unique translation invariant Markov random field with strictly positive conditional probabilities does in fact satisfy this property. This follows from Theorem 4.1 in <ref> [10] </ref>, the lower semicontinuity of relative entropy and Theorem 15.37 in [12], p. 323. The above discussion leads to the following questions.

Reference-contexts: Finally, after this, it was proved (see [21]) that for any two finite state Markov chains with the same entropy and period, there exists a finitary isomorphism between them whose inverse is also finitary. We mention that it was proved much earlier (see <ref> [11] </ref>) that a finite state mixing Markov chain is isomorphic (not necessarily finitarily) to an i.i.d. process. 3 For d 2, one considers probability measures and on A Z d and B Z d respectively which are each invariant under the natural Z d -action.

Reference-contexts: Finally, it is known (see <ref> [12] </ref>, p. 322-323) that for any two Markov random fields all of whose cylinder sets have positive probability and which have the same conditional probabilities, the lower divergence rate of one with respect to the other is 0. <p> We first mention that there exists a translation invariant Markov random field which is the unique translation invariant Markov random field with its conditional probabilities, but which is not a Bernoulli shift. For example, for the antiferromagnetic Ising Model in 2 dimensions (see <ref> [12] </ref> for the definition of this) above the critical interaction parameter, there is a unique translation invariant Markov random field with the proper conditional probabilities, but this field is not even totally ergodic and hence not a Bernoulli shift (it splits as a convex combination of two periodic Markov random fields <p> addition to being the unique translation invariant Markov random field with its conditional probabilities, it is also extremal in the class of all Markov random fields with its conditional probabilities, then it is not known whether is necessarily a Bernoulli shift (although it is in this case necessarily K, see <ref> [12] </ref>). In fact, even if is the unique Markov random field with its conditional probabilities (unique among all both translation invariant and nontranslation invariant Markov random fields), which implies that is translation invariant and K, it is still not known whether is necessarily a Bernoulli shift. <p> This follows from Theorem 4.1 in [10], the lower semicontinuity of relative entropy and Theorem 15.37 in <ref> [12] </ref>, p. 323.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the higher-dimensional generalizations above of results concerning the blowing-up property, are also useful outside the scope of this paper. Remark (f ): Finally, we mention that there are nontrivial Markov random fields in higher dimensions which have the blowing-up property. Theorem 2 in <ref> [26] </ref> easily extends to d 2 dimensions. Using this corollary together with the arguments in [31], it follows that when there is a unique Markov random field for the Ising model, it has the blowing-up property.

This definition, which we will need here, immediately extends to random fields and is the following. <p> Therefore the blowing-up property is related to the notion of concentration of measure, see [37]. Proof of Theorem 2.1: It is proved in <ref> [27] </ref> that finitary codings preserve the blowing-up property in 1-d. The proof of this result goes through step by step to d 2 dimensions. It is proved in [8] that a 1-d i.i.d. process satisfies the blowing-up property. This result for 1-d immediately yields the same fact for higher dimensions. <p> Therefore, in order to show that there does not exist an i.i.d. random field and a finitary coding from onto -, we need only show that does not have the blowing-up property. Next, it follows immediately from Theorem 1.1 in <ref> [27] </ref> that if a 1-d process has the blowing-up property, then given any other (different) ergodic process -, the lower divergence rate of with respect to is positive where the lower divergence rate, also known as relative entropy, of with respect to for Z d processes is defined as lim inf <p> This is not true as we will indicate below. As noted in the proof of the theorem, such a finitary factor satisfies the blowing-up property. In <ref> [27] </ref>, it is proved that in 1 dimension a process satisfies the blowing-up property if and only if it is a Bernoulli shift, has the "exponential rate of convergence property for frequencies" (which means that the mean ergodic theorem for cylinder sets occurs at an exponential rate) and has the "exponential

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the main motivations for our paper is the following (all definitions will be given later): In <ref> [31] </ref>, it is proved that the plus state for the Ising model (with 0 external field) is a Bernoulli shift (i.e., is isomorphic to an i.i.d. process) below, above and at the critical value of the interaction parameter. <p> An example of such a field is the "plus state" for the Ising model with sufficiently large interaction parameter (see Section 4). In Section 4, it is explained that this example satisfies the assumptions of Theorem 2.1 while the fact that it is a Bernoulli shift is proved in <ref> [31] </ref>. (Whenever we refer to [31] in this paper, if one wants to see published work on the same topic, one can refer to [1] which extends the work in [31] to an amenable group setting.) The above theorem also holds in many situations where one does not need to assume <p> In Section 4, it is explained that this example satisfies the assumptions of Theorem 2.1 while the fact that it is a Bernoulli shift is proved in <ref> [31] </ref>. (Whenever we refer to [31] in this paper, if one wants to see published work on the same topic, one can refer to [1] which extends the work in [31] to an amenable group setting.)

(Whenever we refer to [31] in this paper, if one wants to see published work on the same topic, one can refer to [1] which extends the work in [31] to an amenable group setting.) The above theorem also holds in many situations where one does not need to assume that all the cylinder sets have positive probability. <p> Remark (f ): Finally, we mention that there are nontrivial Markov random fields in higher dimensions which have the blowing-up property. Theorem 2 in [26] easily extends to d 2 dimensions. Using this corollary together with the arguments in <ref> [31] </ref>, it follows that when there is a unique Markov random field for the Ising model, it has the blowing-up property.

Reference-contexts: The notions of (finitary) coding and Bernoulli shift extend immediately to d 2 dimensions. The Ornstein isomorphism theorem also extends to d 2 dimensions (see [18]) and in fact much further to amenable groups (see <ref> [32] </ref>). It is also mentioned in [18] that the theorem by Ornstein mentioned earlier that a factor of an i.i.d. process is a Bernoulli shift also extends to random fields. Several results in this paper are about Markov random fields which, for completeness, we give the definition of.

Reference-contexts: Instead of formulating the Martinelli-Olivieri result precisely here, we will state its analog for the following, discrete-time dynamics, which corresponds with a cellular automaton to which Theorem 3.4 can be applied. (There are several other ways to set up a discrete-time dynamics for the Ising model (see e.g. <ref> [36] </ref> and [24]) but for our purpose we prefer the one below). At each discrete time step, each vertex is, independent of the others, `activated' with probability 1=2.

Reference-contexts: The idea is that for large n, any set of configurations whose measure is not too exponentially small has the property that most configurations are (d) nearby it. Therefore the blowing-up property is related to the notion of concentration of measure, see <ref> [37] </ref>. Proof of Theorem 2.1: It is proved in [27] that finitary codings preserve the blowing-up property in 1-d. The proof of this result goes through step by step to d 2 dimensions. It is proved in [8] that a 1-d i.i.d. process satisfies the blowing-up property.
