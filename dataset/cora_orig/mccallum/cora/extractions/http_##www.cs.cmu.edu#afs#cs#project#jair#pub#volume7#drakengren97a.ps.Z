Abstract: This paper combines two important directions of research in temporal resoning: that of finding maximal tractable subclasses of Allen's interval algebra, and that of reasoning with metric temporal information. Eight new maximal tractable subclasses of Allen's interval algebra are presented, some of them subsuming previously reported tractable algebras. The algebras allow for metric temporal constraints on interval starting or ending points, using the recent framework of Horn DLRs. Two of the algebras can express the notion of sequentiality between intervals, being the first such algebras admitting both qualitative and metric time.

Reference-contexts: However, since even the restricted problem of reasoning with pure qualitative time in Allen's interval algebra <ref> (Allen, 1983) </ref> is NP-complete (Vilain et al., 1989), research has focused on identifying classes of problems where reasoning is tractable (Drakengren and Jonsson, 1996; Golumbic and Shamir, 1993; Kautz and Ladkin, 1991; Nebel and Burckert, 1995; van Beek and Cohen, 1990; van Beek, 1989; van Beek, 1992). <p> In Section 5 and Section 6, we prove that the algorithm is correct and that the algebras are maximal. Finally, Section 7 and Section 8 discuss and conclude the paper. 2. Allen's Interval Algebra Allen's interval algebra <ref> (Allen, 1983) </ref> is based on the notion of relations between pairs of intervals. An interval x is represented as a tuple hx ; x + i of real numbers with x &lt; x + , denoting the left and right endpoints of the interval, respectively, and relations between 2.

Reference-contexts: That is, we would like to have a result similar to the unique maximality result of the ORD-Horn class, showing that these algebras are the only algebras satisfying some specific criterion of relevance. In fact, recent results by the authors <ref> (Drakengren and Jonsson, 1997) </ref> state that any tractable subclass that is not yet known in the literature cannot contain more than three basic relation including converses (technically, it cannot contain basic relations other than (), (b) and (b ^ ) for b 2 fd; o; s; fg). <p> Of course, the ultimate goal is to classify the complete set of maximal tractable sub-algebras, but since there are 2 8192 subclasses to investigate, this is clearly a nontrivial task. Recent results on the RCC-5 algebra for spatial reasoning <ref> (Jonsson and Drakengren, 1997) </ref> show that brute-force methods can have success in characterising the complete set of tractable subclasses. The present problem is harder with several orders of magnitude, however, since the RCC-5 algebra contains only 2 32 relations. <p> Nevertheless, it is encouraging to note that there are only four maximal tractable subclasses of the RCC-5 algebra, out of the approximately 4:3 10 9 subclasses. As mentioned above, recent results by the authors <ref> (Drakengren and Jonsson, 1997) </ref> also provide a partial classification of tractability in Allen's algebra, using similar methods. Concerning metric time, it still remains to provide the nine maximal tractable algebras of Drakengren and Jonsson (1996) with some kind of metric temporal information.

Reference-contexts: Until recently, approaches have mostly been either metric or qualitative, with a few exceptions (Kautz and Ladkin, 1991; Meiri, 1991; Gerevini et al., 1993). However, the approach of Jonsson and Backstrom (1996) <ref> (also developed independently by Koubarakis, 1996) </ref> manages to unify almost every approach to tractable reasoning about metric time, qualitative time and the integrated approaches in one framework, that of Horn disjunctive linear relations (Horn-DLRs), in which the reasoning problem can be solved in polynomial time.

Reference-contexts: Proposition 6.5 The algebras S (b), E (b), S fl , E fl are maximal tractable. Proof: By running the utility atry <ref> (Nebel and Burckert, 1993) </ref>, which generates minimal extensions of subclasses by adding a relation and computing the closure of that class. <p> Since the expression u + = v is allowed in H, we can express the basic relation m, and assume 41 Drakengren & Jonsson that it is included in S. It is easily verified that fmg contains all the basic relations (using e.g. the utility aclose <ref> (Nebel and Burckert, 1993) </ref>), and thus S contains all basic relations. <p> A simple examination shows that we cannot use the present technique, since this would make the 42 Eight Maximal Tractable Subclasses of Allen's Algebra with Metric Time resulting algebras NP-complete (just add the qualitative relations induced by relations on starting or ending points, run aclose <ref> (Nebel and Burckert, 1993) </ref>, and verify that at least one of the NP-complete algebras of Proposition 6.4 is included), so for this, some other kind of expressivity is needed. Searching for other starting or ending point algebras could also be fruitful.

Reference-contexts: Since its expressiveness in terms of qualitative information subsumes that of the maximal tractable 1 ORD-Horn algebra <ref> (Nebel and Burckert, 1995) </ref>, it can be viewed as a maximal tractable subalgebra of Allen's interval algebra, provided with metric temporal information. <p> Since any subclass of Allen's algebra containing all the basic relations has to be contained in the ORD-Horn algebra in order to be tractable, and is NP-complete otherwise <ref> (Nebel and Burckert, 1995) </ref>, NP-completeness follows. 2 Despite this result, it seems possible to express constraints on duration of intervals, without restricting their absolute position in time, and still obtain a polynomial-time algorithm, but this is left for future work. <p> Discussion It seems appropriate to summarise the status of the search for maximal tractable subclasses of Allen's interval algebra: The eight new maximal tractable subalgebras presented in this paper increase the number of currently known maximal tractable subclasses to eighteen, including the ORD-Horn class <ref> (Nebel and Burckert, 1995) </ref>, and the nine algebras found by Drakengren and Jonsson (1996).

Reference-contexts: Two of the maximal algebras can express the notion of sequentiality between intervals 2 , important for example in reasoning about action <ref> (Sandewall, 1994) </ref>, where actions are typically assumed to occur in sequence. To our knowledge, these are the first such algebras in the literature that are also provided with metric temporal information.

Further, it seems possible that the techniques presented here can also be used for extending the point-interval algebra <ref> (Vilain, 1982) </ref> with metric time. 8.
