Abstract: Betting on a horse race is, in many ways, like investing in a financial market. You invest your money on the horse that you believe is going to win the race, in the hope of a return on your investment. Like some financial investments, horse race betting is a high risk investment, in that you can lose all of your money. As with making the right financial decision, the return on your investment, if you bet on the winning horse, can be considerable. In this paper, we present EDDIE, a genetic programming system, which augments an experts knowledge and guides the expert into making the best investment decision. We set out to show that by using EDDIE, and a financial experts expertise, we can guide that expert towards the best investment decision and maximise that experts return on investment.

Reference-contexts: SEAGUL [de la Maza89] uses a breed of genetic algorithm known as a genetic classifier [Goldberg89] which classifies horses as winners or losers and gives a reasonable ROI. Genetic classifiers have been used in financial markets with a fair amount of success <ref> [Bauer94] </ref>. The problem with SEAGUL is that it only classifies horses as winners or losers. If, however, the horse classified as the winner does not arrive at the race track then all of the other horses, having been classified as losers, will not provide a betting opportunity.

Reference-contexts: Results A database of 180 handicap races, for horses rated from 0 to 80 by the official handicapper, was used. This type of race was selected because it is generally recognised as being difficult to predict the outcome of such races <ref> [Braddock83] </ref>. It is therefore an excellent way of testing the EDDIE methodology. The 180 races were split into two databases of 150 training races and 30 testing races.

Reference-contexts: EDDIE then tests those hypotheses and evolves, by way of natural selection, a decision tree which will attempt to provide a good ROI. There have been previous attempts at developing horse racing experts. SEAGUL [de la Maza89] uses a breed of genetic algorithm known as a genetic classifier <ref> [Goldberg89] </ref> which classifies horses as winners or losers and gives a reasonable ROI. Genetic classifiers have been used in financial markets with a fair amount of success [Bauer94]. The problem with SEAGUL is that it only classifies horses as winners or losers.

Reference-contexts: EDDIE produces genetic decision trees (GDTs) that guide an investor towards making the best investment decision. The idea behind GDTs is taken from the genetic programming paradigm <ref> [Koza92] </ref>. Genetic programs consist of hierarchical computer programs of varying size and shape. Genetic programming borrows heavily from Darwinian theory in that the fittest programs, in a population, survive, and reproduce successively better solutions to a given problem.

Reference-contexts: The problem with SEAGUL is that it only classifies horses as winners or losers. If, however, the horse classified as the winner does not arrive at the race track then all of the other horses, having been classified as losers, will not provide a betting opportunity. HOBBES <ref> [McNatton94] </ref> is an expert system which uses production rules to determine the winner of a horse race. However, HOBBES requires that an expert has complete knowledge of the complexities of horse racing.

Reference-contexts: As a source of information the work of a horse racing expert was used so as to propose some hypotheses as to what made one horse better than another <ref> [Mordin93] </ref>. All GDTs in the EDDIE system are binary decision trees in that each rule in the decision tree is either true or false and then branches into one of two possible ways depending on whether the answer to the rule was true or false.
