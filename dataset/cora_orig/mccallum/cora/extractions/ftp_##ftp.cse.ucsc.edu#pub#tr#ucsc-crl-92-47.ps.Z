Abstract: Using the ucsc-report abstract This technical report describes how to use L a T E X to produce technical reports in the proper format for the UCSC Baskin Center for Computer Engineering and Information Sciences series.

Reference-contexts: For more information, see the Unix manual. It is also possible to include pictures in PostScript format generated by other programs, including psfig and Macintosh drawing programs. For more details, see the local user's guide <ref> [Computer Engineering, 1990] </ref>, which is being prepared by Dirk Coldewey. 1.3. <p> Because I have set the path in the TEXINPUTS environment variable to include my tex directory, all I need to put in the preamble for letters is "input-return-addr-. For more information on setting up the TEXINPUTS environment variable, see the local guide <ref> [Computer Engineering, 1990] </ref>. Figure 3.1 shows my return address file. The new ucletter style file has two main environments: letter and narrowletter. The two environments are used identically|the only difference is in the size of the side margins. <p> The programs T E X, L a T E X, and BibT E X are installed and maintained locally by Dirk Coldewey, who has also contributed to the local guide <ref> [Computer Engineering, 1990] </ref>.

T E X is a versatile document preparation program, but is often difficult for beginners. L a T E X sacrifices some versatility to make it easier to create documents.

Reference-contexts: University Microfilms indexes and distributes Ph.D. theses, but there is a substantial delay, and the quality of their reproductions is often quite poor. 1.2 Why use L a T E X? L a T E X is a macro package written by Leslie Lamport <ref> [Lamport, 1986] </ref> for Donald Knuth's TeX [Knuth, 1984]. T E X is a versatile document preparation program, but is often difficult for beginners. L a T E X sacrifices some versatility to make it easier to create documents. <p> The "thanks command uses symbols for footnote marks, in the order given in the L a T E X manual <ref> [Lamport, 1986, page 175] </ref>: 1. fl created with "ast. 2. y created with "dag. 3. z created with "ddag. 4. x created with "S. 5. created with "P. 6. k created with "|. 7. flfl created with "ast"ast. 8. yy created with "dag"dag. 9. zz created with "ddag"ddag. <p> Every technical report should have an abstract. In this style file, the abstract is passed as the argument to the "abstract command, not using the abstract environment as described in the L a T E X manual <ref> [Lamport, 1986, page 84] </ref>. If you want your abstract to be called something other than abstract, you can use an optional argument to give it a different name. For example, you can now say "abstract [Executive Summary]-...- to call the abstract an executive summary. <p> Not every technical report needs an index, but reports that lack a needed index are more common than reports with a superfluous one. User documentation for a program almost always needs an index. You could use L a T E X's built-in index capabilities <ref> [Lamport, 1986, pp. 78-79, 153, 186, 189] </ref>, but you'd have to write your own program to sort the entries, merge adjacent page numbers, choose the correct fonts, and format them correctly. I have written some commands and scripts to generate indices automatically. <p> A dummy thesis dummy-thesis.tex has been created for you to modify|it should be in /usr/local/lib/tex/inputs. Figure 2.1 shows a typical sequence of commands for making the front matter, taken from that example. 2.8 Bibliographies The best way to create a bibliography is to use Oren Patashnik's BibT E X <ref> [Lamport, 1986, Appendix B] </ref>. To use BibT E X, you need to create a .bib file containing all the papers you wish to cite. You may include as many other papers as you like in each .bib file, and you may use multiple .bib files. <p> Instructions for using BibT E X are included in the L a T E X manual <ref> [Lamport, 1986] </ref> and will not be duplicated here. However, there are several new bibliography style files that are not included in the manual. <p> Other style files 3. Other style files 3.1 Writing letters with ucletter The ucletter style file was modified from the standard letter style <ref> [Lamport, 1986, Section 3.8] </ref> by several people, including Pak Chan, Allen Van Gelder, and me. The ucletter style is especially designed to create University of California letterhead, complete with seal. It should only be used for UC business|for other purposes, try using the standard letter style.
