Abstract: We describe an interior-point algorithm for monotone linear complementarity problems in which primal-dual affine scaling is used to generate the search directions. The algorithm is shown to have global and superlinear convergence with Q-order up to (but not including) two. The technique is shown to be consistent with a potential-reduction algorithm, yielding the first potential-reduction algorithm that is both globally and superlinearly convergent.

Reference-contexts: The resulting algorithm is again globally and superlinearly convergent. Tuncel <ref> [16] </ref> introduced an algorithm for linear programming that uses affine scaling search directions in conjunction with a penalty function of the form ffi (x; y) = (ffi + 1) log (x T y=n) log (min fx j y j g); (4) for ffi &gt; 0. <p> Step lengths are chosen to keep ffi constant from iteration to iteration. This function is closely related to our neighborhood N (ffi; j) since (x; y) 2 N (ffi; j) , ffi (x; y) log j (1 + ffi) log n: Tuncel <ref> [16] </ref> proves global convergence but has no superlinear convergence result. In Section 5, we prove as a consequence of our results that Tuncel's method is superlinear for ffi 2 (0; 1). <p> Then the sequence fx k T y k g generated by Algorithm PDPR converges to zero superlinearly with Q-order 2 ffi. 5 Concluding Remarks In this concluding section, we discuss the close relationship that exists between the algorithm of Theorem 3.6 and the one presented by Tuncel <ref> [16] </ref>. We also show that Tuncel's algorithm is superlinearly convergent whenever the parameter ffi that appears in the potential function (4) lies in the interval (0; 1). <p> For the purpose of this section, we also assume that the matrix M in (1) is skew-symmetric. Since Tuncel's algorithm is for linear programs, it fits into this framework. We describe Tuncel's algorithm in an equivalent but slightly different way from <ref> [16] </ref> in order to better point out its connection to the neighborhood N (ffi; j). Let the strictly feasible point (x k ; y k ) be the k-th iterate of the algorithm.

These directions are simply Newton steps for the system of nonlinear equations formed by (1a) and the complementarity condition XY e = 0.

Lemma 2.2 plays a crucial role in deriving this stronger version. We can now merge the results of Theorem 2.5 with Lemmas 2.9 and 2.11 to obtain the following theorem.
