Reference-contexts: The max cut problem remains NP-hard for such cases. - 3 - 2 Previous Work There history of work on approximate graph bisection problems dates back at least thirty years. We will not attempt to chronicle this work here. A more thorough review is presented in <ref> [Ber94] </ref>. An excellent survey of results in spectral and polyhedral approaches to the max cut problem is presented in [PT93]. Below, we will give a very brief summary of the most familiar approaches to graph partitioning. <p> A similar vertex ordering technique was described in [CSS91]. The W algorithm is so named since the construction of a partitioning represents a single walk down an implicit backtracking tree (where the other branches of the tree are due to possible non-greedy placements. See <ref> [Ber94] </ref> for more details). 4.3 Algorithm Implementations Our implementations of the KL, SA, and PO algorithms all share the exact same bucket data structure code and were implemented in C as parts of a single system by the same programmer. <p> The Path Optimization algorithm is defined for hypergraphs, but the experiments have been limited to binary graphs. Certainly, future work is to explore this area. Finally, the W algorithm has been shown to provide excellent starting parti-tionings when sparse, structured graphs are considered. In <ref> [Ber94] </ref>, a probabilistic-greedy (PG) variation of the greedy W algorithm is described and shown to outperform W in certain cases. The PG PO combination has yet to be explored.

Reference-contexts: For each algorithm, only the best solution for each graph was retained. The sample mean and standard deviation of this set of observations were then computed, as well as a 99% confidence interval for the true mean solution. For a discussion of 100 (1 ff)% confidence intervals, see <ref> [BOD86] </ref>. In standard statistical practice, a confidence interval derived from a sample size of more than thirty trials allows an appeal to The Central Limit Theorem and an argument that, with a given confidence, the true mean lies somewhere in the interval, regardless of the distribution of the individual trials.

Given an initial partitioning = (S; S), PO performs a variation of simple neighborhood search.

Members of R G n;d have also been called "unit disk graphs" in <ref> [CCJ90] </ref>. They are notable for their structured nature and offer a contrast to random graphs. Both of these types of graphs have been used for comparisons before in the literature, and we continue the trend in order to facilitate further comparisons.

Reference-contexts: The problem is modeled with a simple undirected graph and reduced to the problem of finding the max cut of a contraction of this graph. The latter happens to be a planar graph, and there are polynomial-time algorithms for the max cut problem on planar graphs <ref> [Had75, OD72] </ref>. However, a slight complication of the problem yields contracted graphs with the property that for any vertex v, G v is planar.

Reference-contexts: In [HL93b], Hendrickson and Leland give a multilevel algorithm which uses weighted intermediate graphs to preserve good partitionings as the graph is uncontracted. The contractions are obtained by finding maximal matchings and identifying endpoints of matching edges. After the resultant graph is partitioned using the spectral method of <ref> [HL92] </ref>, the original graph is restored through a series of uncontractions, with KL (FM ) occasionally cleaning the partitioning. Results are presented indicating that for bisection of large, sparse graphs, this algorithm performs significantly better than spectral partitioning alone.

Reference-contexts: This problem calls for partitioning into k sets, either directly or using recursive bisection. The partitioning system Chaco, developed at Sandia National Laboratory by Hendrickson and Leland <ref> [HL93a] </ref> is directed towards this application and will be discussed in Section 4. Several real-life applications of the max cut problem are listed in [PT93]. <p> Results are presented indicating that for bisection of large, sparse graphs, this algorithm performs significantly better than spectral partitioning alone. Using Chaco <ref> [HL93a] </ref>, a partitioning system due to Hendrickson and Leland which implements several spectral partitioning methods and the multilevel algorithm described above, we were able to make limited comparisons with W-PO, line-KL, and line-SA.

Reference-contexts: The problem is modeled with a simple undirected graph and reduced to the problem of finding the max cut of a contraction of this graph. The latter happens to be a planar graph, and there are polynomial-time algorithms for the max cut problem on planar graphs <ref> [Had75, OD72] </ref>. However, a slight complication of the problem yields contracted graphs with the property that for any vertex v, G v is planar.
