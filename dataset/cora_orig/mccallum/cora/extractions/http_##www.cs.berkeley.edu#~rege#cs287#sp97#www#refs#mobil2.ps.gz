Reference-contexts: In particular, we introduce a simple but powerful class of elastic deformation models, which are motivated by the work of Gesley [9]. These models are non-linear and admit a configuration-space based representation. This class of models also includes the well known and widely used Hertz contact model <ref> [1] </ref>. The establishment of the basic properties of this class of compliance models is another contribution of this paper. In fact, we are not aware of any other configuration-space based elastic deformation model in the robotics literature. <p> The Hertz Contact model: A more traditional lumped parameter elastic contact model, which has been corroborated in experiments, is due to Hertz (1882) <ref> [1] </ref>. Hertz postulated a specific interbody-body force distribution, whose integration according to the principals of linear elasticity yields an expression for the net deformation at every surface point. This expression can be used to develop the lumped parameter relationship that we need. <p> The relation between ffi and the magnitude of P is given by ffi = 1 c kP k , where c is a positive constant that depends on the elasticity of the bodies and their undeformed contact geometry <ref> [1] </ref>. For a contact of B with A i , it can be shown that ffi is exactly the overlap o i , and c is related to the spring constant i . <p> Let us now identify the points x i and y i in terms of d 0 and d fl . Consider the straight line path within P from d fl to d 0 , ff (t) = (1 t)d fl + td 0 for t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. At t = 0, B (d fl ; 0 ) touches A i at the point y i . Let r i be the corresponding point in B's body coordinates i.e., y i = R ( 0 )r i + d fl .

Reference-contexts: In this paper we justified these results from a dynamic perspective. These results have obvious uses for fixture planning. Previous investigators have analyzed the fixture planning problem and have proposed algorithms based on 1 st order mobility theories (see [15] and <ref> [2] </ref> for example). Our 2 nd order mobility results suggest that many objects can be immobilized with substantially fewer numbers of fixtures than previously thought possible. Differentiating Between Equilibrium Grasps: Not all equilibrium grasps are alike, and a careful grasp planner should choose the most secure grasps.

Reference-contexts: So the lemma says that _x i = 0 or, equivalently, that _r i = 0, if B instantaneously rotates about its contact normal with A i . It is also worth mentioning that Eq. (20) below is similar to the one used in <ref> [16, 3] </ref> to derive the velocity of a contact point between two perfectly rigid bodies performing general roll-slide motion. Proof: We have to show that the endpoints of the overlap segment satisfy _x i = _y i = 0.

Reference-contexts: ffi i at d 0 is given by rffi i (d 0 ) = d 0 d fl : (The vector rffi i (d 0 ) lies within P.) Additionally, if the set S i j 0 is smooth, as in our case, an application of the Lagrange multiplier rule <ref> [4] </ref> implies that rffi i (d 0 ) is perpendicular to S i j 0 within P , at the point d fl 2 S i j 0 . Let us now identify the points x i and y i in terms of d 0 and d fl . <p> An application of the Lagrange multiplier rule <ref> [4] </ref> implies that rffi i (d 0 ) is collinear with the normal to S i j 0 at d fl within P. <p> Substituting this identity into (15) and taking the derivative gives rg (x) = maxff (x); 0g (rf (x) + f (x) f (x) 2 Propagating maxff (x); 0g into the parentheses yields the result. As for the Lipschitz conti nuity of rg (x) see e.g., <ref> [4, p. 47] </ref>. 2 In our case, o i = maxf~o i ; 0g, where ~o i is the following signed overlap function: ~o i (d; ) = dst (d; S i j ) if q is inside CA i dst (d; S i j ) if q is outside CA

Reference-contexts: Hanafusa and Asada [11] implemented an elastic-rods mechanism capable of stably grasping objects based on a mixture of what we would call first and second order ideas. Their work was subsequently extended by Nguyen [19]. Cutkosky and Kao <ref> [5] </ref>, and Montana [17, 18], analyzed the stability of grasps under small perturbation of the contacting fingers. Our work develops a more complete stability result for a much broader and more sophisticated range of modeling assumptions than have previously appeared in the literature.

Reference-contexts: In fact, we are not aware of any other configuration-space based elastic deformation model in the robotics literature. In addition we also introduce a lumped parameter energy loss model that approximately captures the effects of elastic hysteresis during contact deformations. This model is consistent with tribological models <ref> [7] </ref>. While these configuration-space based contact models are useful in their own right, our principal goal is to use these models to investigate the dynamic stability of objects which are immobilized according to our kinematic theory. <p> Elastic potential energy is stored by these deformations. When the two contacting bodies are separated, the deformed particles return to their original configuration, releasing the elastic potential energy. However, in real materials the loading and unloading process is typically not energetically reversible <ref> [7, pp 109-112] </ref>. The energy lost in the process is approximated in this model by the damping term. This particular form of the damping term has been corroborated by experiments that investigated interbody penetration along the contact normal [8].

Reference-contexts: The energy lost in the process is approximated in this model by the damping term. This particular form of the damping term has been corroborated by experiments that investigated interbody penetration along the contact normal <ref> [8] </ref>. We extend this damping model below, to include general penetrations and to bring it into alignment with realistic tribological models. Next we describe several important properties of the contact model, which were not considered by Gesley. <p> The fixtures are circular, with radius of 1 cm. The spring constant is = 8:74fi 10 10 N=m|which is the spring constant calculated by the Hertz contact model. The damping constant, ~, is (1=1:2), a number which was obtained from experiments on curved steel bodies <ref> [8] </ref>.

These models are non-linear and admit a configuration-space based representation. This class of models also includes the well known and widely used Hertz contact model [1]. The establishment of the basic properties of this class of compliance models is another contribution of this paper. <p> This is the "lumped parameter" aspect of our models. We first consider a model where contact forces arise from (very small) elastic deformations of the contacting bodies, as proposed by Gesley <ref> [9] </ref> 2 . This model is considered in detail because of its simplicity. Gesley's model is subsequently extended to a more general class of elastic contact models, which includes the well known Hertzian contact model. <p> We also extend the damping part of Gesley's model to account for a wider range of inelastic effects and to be consistent with results from tribology. 3.1 Gesley's Model In Gesley's elastic deformation model <ref> [9] </ref>, the bodies are still considered to be rigid, but their volumes are allowed to overlap. This overlap approximately models the act of interbody penetration. Similarly, it is postulated that this overlap gives rise to a force that approximates the interbody forces. <p> We now pursue a more formal development of these overlap models, which did not appear in Gesley's work. 2 Gesley's model is known to predict the behavior of mechanisms involving small deformations, such as a clock mechanism <ref> [9] </ref>. 4 The overlap between B (q) and A i is described by the overlap function o i (q). It is defined as the minimal amount of B's translation that separates it from A i (Figure 2 (a)).

Reference-contexts: Further, we prove the stability of systems which are 2 nd order immobile, a heretofore novel idea. This stability result is also an important justification for exploiting second-order effects in practical applications such as fixturing and grasp/posture planning. Recent work by Howard and Kumar <ref> [12] </ref> on stability of multiple-finger grasps also allows for small elastic deformations. However, a formal justification for this assumption is provided only here, in the form of the Mason paradox. They derive related stability results using an entirely different approach.

Reference-contexts: The goal of this paper is to study the nature of the restraining forces which are generated by 2 nd order immobilization 1 . To begin with, we describe an example that we term the Mason Paradox <ref> [14] </ref>. The paradox conclusively shows that the ideal rigid body model used in grasping and mobility analysis is inadequate to completely describe the origin of forces due to surface curvature effects. <p> Throughout the paper we use the notation and concepts of the companion paper [22]. 2 The Mason Paradox An ideal rigid body model allows no deformation or interpenetration to occur when two bodies are pressed into contact. The following paradox <ref> [14] </ref> provides evidence that contact forces generated by second-order effects cannot be completely explained within the context of idealized rigid body models. Let B be an ellipse, held along its major axis by two concave fingers, as shown in Figure 1 (a).

Reference-contexts: In our case rU is not differentiable, but merely Lipschitz continuous, and the non-vanishing of rU requires special technical attention. The analysis of this technical detail can be found in <ref> [20] </ref>, where we show that if the undeformed fingers are in an essential finger arrangement, there exists a neighborhood of q 0 in which rU vanishes only at q 0 . <p> From a technical perspective, this assumption on the loading process is required in order to make a connection between our concept of immobility, which is defined for unloaded states, and stability of a loaded grasp. The proof of the theorem appears in <ref> [20] </ref>. Here we merely give a sketch of the proof. Sketch of proof: The elastic potential energy function, U (q) = P k 1 i (q), is locally smooth for any of the loaded grasps. <p> The details of how the positive definiteness propagates to the entire T q 0 IR m are given in <ref> [20] </ref>. 6 Simulations In this section we briefly present the results of simulations which illustrate the theory described above. We first consider a planar object which is grasped by two disc-like fingers, as shown in Figure 5.

Reference-contexts: The paradox can be resolved if the ideal rigid body model is relaxed to allow small elastic deformations of the contacting bodies. To improve upon the inadequate rigid body models, 1 Portions of this paper recently appeared in <ref> [21] </ref>. 1 we introduce a class of lumped-parameter elastic deformation models. These models capture the qualitative behavior of the elastic deformation of contacting bodies, without the need to compute the explicit distribution of the surface deformations at the contact (such as in [23]).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In <ref> [22] </ref> we introduced a configuration-space based method for analyzing the mobility of a body B in frictionless contact with k finger bodies A 1 ; : : : ; A k at an equilibrium grasp. <p> From the c-space perspective, the goal is to completely isolate an object's contact configuration from the reminder of its freespace, where the fixtures determine the c-obstacles. The minimal 3-finger grasp of Figure 12, for instance, can be regarded as a work holding problem. As discussed in <ref> [22] </ref>, m 2 q 0 = 0 for this example, and the object is completely immobilized by the three point contacts. However, this immobilization cannot be fully explained in terms of instantaneous forces, since conventional force-closure theory would dictate that 4 forces are needed to immobilize this object. <p> Section 7 considers possible applications of our 2 nd order mobility theory. For the sake of clarity and continuity in the presentation, many of the proofs and technical details are relegated to the appendices. Throughout the paper we use the notation and concepts of the companion paper <ref> [22] </ref>. 2 The Mason Paradox An ideal rigid body model allows no deformation or interpenetration to occur when two bodies are pressed into contact. The following paradox [14] provides evidence that contact forces generated by second-order effects cannot be completely explained within the context of idealized rigid body models. <p> That is, _q (t) is continuously tangent to the c-obstacle boundaries that correspond to the fingers at time t. According to Theorem 1 in <ref> [22] </ref>, the wrench generated by a finger is collinear with the unit normal to the finger c-obstacle, w (q; F i ) = i (t)^n i (q) for i = 1; 2. According to Eq. (5) in [22], the work done by these wrenches is _ K = (w (q; F <p> According to Theorem 1 in <ref> [22] </ref>, the wrench generated by a finger is collinear with the unit normal to the finger c-obstacle, w (q; F i ) = i (t)^n i (q) for i = 1; 2. According to Eq. (5) in [22], the work done by these wrenches is _ K = (w (q; F 1 ) + w (q; F 2 )) _q. <p> generalized distance in configuration space: o i (d; ) = dst (d; S i j ) if q is inside CA i 0 if q is outside CA i : (1) Note that o i is similar to d i , the signed Euclidean distance from S i introduced in <ref> [22] </ref>, except that o i is positive inside CA i and is identically zero outside it (Figure 2 (b)). However, note that o i is non-smooth on S i . <p> This result is also an important justification for using second-order effects in applications, as discussed in the concluding section. First we define kinematic immobility as it appeared in <ref> [22] </ref>. Definition 1 An object B held in equilibrium grasp by k finger bodies is completely immobile if its configuration q 0 is isolated from the reminder of its freespace by the fingers' c-obstacles. <p> The wrench due to F i in (8) is determined by Proposition 3.3, and the wrenches due to D i1 and D i2 are determined by Theorem 1 in <ref> [22] </ref>. The vector-field on the right is Lipschitz continuous, which is the criterion for existence and uniqueness of solutions to (8). We may now state the theorem. <p> Similarly, the theorem says that if B is immobilized to 2 nd order (which may use fewer fingers than required for 1 st order force closure <ref> [22] </ref>), it is also passively stable as well. The kinematic notion of 2 nd order immobility ensures that small perturbations will deform the fingers so as to provide the appropriate restoring forces that bring B back to equilibrium. <p> This result provides physical justification for applications of 2 nd order mobility theory. Below are some obvious applications of this work which have motivated our investigation. Work Holding: In <ref> [22] </ref> we already considered the use of 2 nd order effects to prove new lower bounds on the number of frictionless fingers necessary to immobilize an object. In this paper we justified these results from a dynamic perspective. These results have obvious uses for fixture planning. <p> Any interbody force F (x i ) acting on B along the the overlap segment x i y i into B gives a wrench: w (q; F i ) = kF i kro i (q): Proof: According to Theorem 1 of <ref> [22] </ref>, w (q; F i ) = [DX r i (q)] T F i (x i ), since F i (x i ) acts on B (q) at a point x i on its surface. <p> o 2 i is differentiable with Lipschitz continuous derivative, and its deriva tive is r (o i ) 2 = o i ro i if o i &gt; 0 (16) B Details of the Stability Proof We represent the shapes of B and A i as in the appendix of <ref> [22] </ref>.
