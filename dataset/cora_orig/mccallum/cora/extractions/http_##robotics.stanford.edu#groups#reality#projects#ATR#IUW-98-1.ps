Reference-contexts: There clearly is substantial apparent persistence. The quantitative characterization of persistent scattering is that there are typically 10 scatterers persistent over at least 15 degrees azimuth. That is similar to results of <ref> [Dudgeon et al. 94] </ref> for ISAR data. That characterization underestimates somewhat the persistence of scatterers that are obscured at some angles, then reappear. Reappearance is typical in looking at individual scatterers.
