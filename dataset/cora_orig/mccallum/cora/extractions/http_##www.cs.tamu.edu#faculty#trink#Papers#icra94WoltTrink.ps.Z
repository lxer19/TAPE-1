Title: Automatic Selection of Fixture Points for Frictionless Assemblies

Abstract: During the assembly of a product, it is vital that the partially completed assembly be stable. If the assembly is unstable, then it must be fixtured to stabilize it before retrieving the next part or subassembly. This paper presents a stability test and a new approach to automatically generating the positions of a small set of fixture elements (fixels) that will stabilize an assembly. The stability test and the fixel positioning approach consider both the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of each part. Since all the relevant mechanical constraints are linear functions of the contact force magnitudes and the components of the velocities of the parts, linear programming techniques can be used with great efficiency.

Reference-contexts: The approach requires the solution of a single linear program in which the fixel locations (and the contact forces) appear as variables. With the exception of Fahlman's work, previous approaches to automated fixture design have been developed for only a single part (for example, see <ref> [1, 5] </ref>), and so they cannot be applied to the problem considered in this paper. Fahlman [7] designed and implemented a "blocks world" task planner that automatically determined assembly plans for block structures.

Reference-contexts: The time to find the contacts and set up the matrices of coefficients typically accounted for less than one twenty-fifth of the total run time. Simplex algorithms typically run in time roughly proportional to the cube of the number of constraints <ref> [9] </ref>, however the complexity of some of the linear programming routines tested appeared to be nearer to the fourth power of the number of constraints.

Reference-contexts: Palmer defined six stability classes which all collapse, in the fric 1 tionless case, to a pair of dual classification, referred to as "guaranteed stability" and its dual, "potential instability." In related work, Trinkle <ref> [14] </ref> derived analogous stability conditions for a single grasped frictionless object referred to as the "velocity formulation" and its dual, the "force formulation." When the velocity or force formulation is extended to multiple grasped objects and the finger velocities are set to zero, Palmer's and Trinkle's stability tests are identical. <p> part (shaded). (a) Contacts among the parts. (b) Fall-down velocity found by the system applied for a short time interval. 3.1 Velocity Formulation An assembly is stable (to first order) if all infinitesimal motions of the system consistent with the kinematic constraints strictly increase the potential energy of the system <ref> [14] </ref>. If a motion exists for which the potential energy decreases, then the assembly is unstable. Thus the stability of a given assembly can be assessed by determining whether the assembly's configuration defines a local minimum of its potential energy constrained by the fact that the parts may not overlap. <p> When such a situation occurs, the stability tests presented below cannot resolve the stability question, but they do provide an indication that second or higher order information is needed. A method for determining stability or instability using second-order information is presented in [15]. Following the approach used in <ref> [14] </ref>, let _q be the generalized velocity vector of the bodies in the assembly.

Reference-contexts: In the interest of brevity, only the two-dimensional case is presented here, however the algorithm is easily extended to three-dimensional assemblies <ref> [16] </ref> and some three-dimensional results will be given. Overcoming the frictionless assumption is more difficult, but to assume the absence of friction when testing for stability is actually quite sensible in production planning applications. <p> This will lead to a fixture that will be stable for all the external forces tested, and for all positive linear combinations of those forces. Though the number of fixels placed by this method may not be minimal, tests have given good results <ref> [16] </ref>. In conclusion, we have described a basic technique for generating fixture points that is both efficient enough to be quite practical and readily extensible to a wide range of related problems. While our technique has several drawbacks, they can easily be remedied.
