Title: On the Existence of Schedules that are Near-Optimal for both Makespan and Total Weighted Completion Time  
Author: Cliff Stein Joel Wein 
Keyword: Deterministic sequencing: single machine and multiple machine  
Abstract: We give a simple proof that, for any instance of a very general class of scheduling problems, there exists a schedule of makespan at most twice that of the optimal possible and of total weighted completion time at most twice that of the optimal possible. We then refine the analysis, yielding variants of this theorem with improved constants, and give some algorithmic consequences of the technique.

Reference-contexts: A tour is defined as a permutation of the n cities that defines the order in which they are to be traversed. The classical Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is to produce a tour of minimum length [16]. A variant is known as the Traveling Repairman Problem (TRP) <ref> [1, 2, 7] </ref>. <p> Proof: Consider T , the schedule of optimal average weighted completion time. We divide time into four intervals: I 0 = [0; ff`]; I 1 = [ff`; fi`]; I 2 = [fi`; fl`]; I 3 = <ref> [fl`; 1] </ref>, and let W i = j:C T j 2I i w j C j and define W fl = P j = j w j C fl j . We will consider truncating T at times ff`, fi` and fl`.

Reference-contexts: Until quite recently there was essentially nothing in the way of general algorithmic techniques for bicriteria scheduling, or results about the quality of approximation that might be obtained simultaneously. Recently, Chakrabarti, Phillips, Schulz, Shmoys, Stein & Wein <ref> [4] </ref> gave a general technique for designing algorithms that simultaneously optimize both makespan and average weighted completion time. They require an algorithm for the maximum scheduled weight problem: given a deadline D, schedule a set of jobs of maximum possible weight by time D. <p> Following the construction of Corollary 2 we obtain that C N max (1+ffi)C M max , P j ffi+1 P j fi ffi+1 P j : For some scheduling models this corollary yields better bicriteria algorithms than what can be achieved by the technique of Chakrabarti et. al. <ref> [4] </ref>; we discuss these after we have presented the improved analysis in the next section. We conclude our collection of corollaries with an application to the traveling salesman problem. <p> For some scheduling models this corollary yields better bicriteria algorithms than what can be achieved by the technique of Chakrabarti et. al. <ref> [4] </ref>; To begin, consider the special case of w j = 1 for all j. <p> All of these results are clearly better than the best possible via the technique of Chakrabarti et. al. <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Hurkens and Coster gave instances of this problem for which any schedule with optimal average completion time has makespan (log n) times optimal <ref> [14] </ref>. Our result demonstrates that, for this problem and many others, if one does not require a schedule that is optimal with respect to average weighted completion time, but only near-optimal, then there exists a schedule that is near-optimal with respect to makespan as well.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The theory of scheduling is now over 40 years old, and since the first papers in the mid-1950s numerous scheduling algorithms have been designed to optimize many sorts of optimality criteria in a wide variety of scheduling models; see Lawler, Lenstra, Rinooy Kan and Shmoys <ref> [17] </ref> for a detailed survey. Two fundamental and much-studied optimality criteria are the makespan (schedule length) and the average weighted completion time, and there has been much work on the design of algorithms that give either optimal solutions or approximately-optimal solutions for both optimality criteria.
