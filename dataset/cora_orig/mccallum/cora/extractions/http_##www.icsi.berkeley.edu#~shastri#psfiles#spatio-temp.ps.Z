Reference-contexts: Skew in handwriting can be viewed as a distortion produced by an author favoring, and perhaps elongating, strokes in certain orientations which (often systematically) deviate in angle from prototypical stroke orientations. A moment-based transformation to correct individual character skew <ref> (Bakis et al., 1968) </ref> was applied to all isolated digit images. This technique is equivalent to shifting rows of bits horizontally to remove the skew.

Reference-contexts: In many handwritten text domains, only a subset of all possible strings are legal and hence, a dictionary of legal strings can be made available. This permits the utilization of predictive dependencies between 19 characters, derived from statistical analysis of the dictionary (e.g., <ref> (Bledsoe and Browning, 1959) </ref>) and the usage of contextual word post processing algorithms (eg, (Doster, 1977; Shingal and Toussaint, 1979)). The incorporation of such domain knowledge is relatively straightforward when a procedural component is used.

Reference-contexts: The integrated outputs of the units can be interpreted as probability estimations by normalizing the values to obey the laws of probability <ref> (Bridle, 1990) </ref>. Although this transformation does not affect single object classification (in a winner-take-all sense), it is useful in the integration of various components of a recognition system (eg, the RRD, CRD, and PC).

Reference-contexts: Similarly, propagation delays, delay tuned neurons, and coincidence detectors are used by bats for echo-location and by the barn owl for localization of objects via the detection of differences in inter-aural timing (e.g., see <ref> (Carr and Konishi, 1990) </ref>). 3 The word recognition system 3.1 Overview The complete system (refer to Figure 1) consists of three components: the Refined Recognition Device (RRD), Coarse Recognition Device (CRD), and Procedural Controller (PC).

Reference-contexts: Connectionist networks offer a powerful framework for pursuing this approach and their strength has been demonstrated in a variety of pattern recognition problems including speech recognition (e.g., (Watrous, 1990; Waibel et al., 1989; Boulard and Morgan, 1994)), face recognition (e.g. <ref> (Cottrell and Metcalfe, 1991) </ref>) 1 The scope of the problem can partially be gauged by the fact that the United States Postal Service alone processes over 80 million handwritten pieces of mail every day. 2 In contrast to handwritten text recognition, excellent results have been obtained for reading of machine printed

Reference-contexts: Connected components can be extracted by a simple scan of the image and a parallel connectionist implementation is described in <ref> (Fontaine, 1993) </ref>. Each connected component so obtained is first processed by the RRD. If the RRD recognizes a component as a digit with high confidence, the component is deemed to be that digit. <p> The number before the slash below each image is the true classification and the number after the slash is the (incorrect) RRD classification. A 99% accuracy was obtained upon rejecting 9.5% of the images. A detailed analysis of the RRD performance may be found in <ref> (Fontaine, 1993) </ref>. One must be cautious in making comparisons between recognition systems since reliable comparative performance measures cannot be obtained without using identical test databases, visited only once by each 27 recognition system. Other factors also need to be considered when making comparisons. <p> A more detailed discussion of these issues may be found in <ref> (Fontaine, 1993) </ref>. Refined Recognition Device Ideally, the RRD should recognize characters in the target alphabet and reject all non-character blobs, but the dimensionality of the input space makes the derivation of such a device very difficult.

Reference-contexts: The aspect ratio of the character was preserved by padding with white space, if necessary. A nearest neighbor method which sampled pixels in the original image at regular intervals was used to perform the scaling <ref> (Hou, 1983) </ref>. In the case of images used for training the CRD, the image was scaled down to fit in a rectangle containing twenty rows of pixels while preserving the aspect ratio. The number of columns therefore varied, depending on the width of the digit.

Reference-contexts: This approach has produced good results in isolated character recognition and has also been applied with limited success to word recognition <ref> (Keeler and Rumelhart, 1992) </ref>. An alternate approach is to convert an image into a time-varying signal by scanning it in one or more directions and presenting the resulting spatio-temporal signal to the recognition system. <p> This makes it difficult for a conventional connectionist model to recognize words. Some progress has been made by replicating and tessellating network substructures to deal with images with multiple characters <ref> (Keeler and Rumelhart, 1992) </ref> and by using a sliding window (Martin, 1993). <p> Of course, this is an upper bound for the given RRD. The results obtained by our system seem satisfactory in view of the significant overlap and touching among digit-pairs.

While (Keeler and Rumelhart, 1992) report an accuracy of 99% with about 10% rejects on digit-fields of length two, (Martin, 1993) reports an accuracy of 98.99% with about 4.76% rejects <p> In addition, Table 2 shows little variation between images created from the training or test sets, suggesting good generalization. <ref> (Keeler and Rumelhart, 1992) </ref> and (Martin, 1993) have developed integrated segmentation and recognition systems and reported results using the NIST database.

ZIP Code Recognition The same system which was applied to digit pair images was also applied to the real-world ZIP codes provided by the United States Postal Service. <p> The system, as implemented, can hardly hope to classify an image containing a stray blotch or an ascender (descender) correctly, since it is forced to generate an extra digit classification.

Reference-contexts: For example, (Le Cun et al., 1990) have reported achieving an accuracy of 95.42% with 0% rejection on a test-set containing 2007 digits from the USPS data 8 . Using a test-set of 1800 digits <ref> (Knerr et al., 1992) </ref> have reported an accuracy of 95.80% with 2.4% rejections. The latter obtained improved performance by using a feature-based input representation instead of a pixel-based representation. The feature-based representation resulted in an accuracy of 97.47% with 1% rejections.

Reference-contexts: Hence, a method must be devised for recognition regardless of which set of input units receives the data. Typically this is achieved by replicating each feature detector a number of times in order to cover the entire image <ref> (Le Cun et al., 1990) </ref>. An obvious but significant advantage of our approach is that it naturally leads to a recognition system that is shift invariant along the temporalized axis (es). <p> The integrated outputs of the units can be interpreted as probability estimations by normalizing the values to obey the laws of probability <ref> (Bridle, 1990) </ref>. Although this transformation does not affect single object classification (in a winner-take-all sense), it is useful in the integration of various components of a recognition system (eg, the RRD, CRD, and PC). <p> These include the form of input representation and preprocessing, and the amount of data used for training. The accuracy of the RRD on USPS test data is comparable to the best results reported on test samples drawn from the USPS database. For example, <ref> (Le Cun et al., 1990) </ref> have reported achieving an accuracy of 95.42% with 0% rejection on a test-set containing 2007 digits from the USPS data 8 .

Reference-contexts: The target response during assimilation of the actual digit was a sigmoid, rising from 0.05 at the onset to 0.95 at its end, with its inflection point placed 60% through the extent of the example. 4.5 Training Training was done using the second-order quasi-Newton Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm <ref> (Luenberger, 1984) </ref> using (i) gradsim | a system for applying nonlinear gradient optimization techniques to train spatio-temporal connectionist networks from examples (Watrous, 1988) and (ii) grad-cm2 a data-parallel version of gradsim implemented on a Connection Machine CM-2 (Fontaine, 1992).

Reference-contexts: The plot for each input unit depicts its activation level over time (the levels of activation can be viewed as being represented along the z axis orthogonal to the page). The spatio-temporal proposed here is distinct from the "sliding-window" approach adopted by <ref> (Martin, 1993) </ref> wherein the width of the sliding window is comparable to, or even greater than, the extent of individual digits being recognized. <p> This makes it difficult for a conventional connectionist model to recognize words. Some progress has been made by replicating and tessellating network substructures to deal with images with multiple characters (Keeler and Rumelhart, 1992) and by using a sliding window <ref> (Martin, 1993) </ref>. The ability to process arbitrarily long images is inherent in our approach, and offers an alternate means of processing word images within a connectionist framework (see Section 3). 2.2 Spatio-temporal networks Processing a spatio-temporal signal requires a model capable of processing time-varying signals. <p> The results obtained by our system seem satisfactory in view of the significant overlap and touching among digit-pairs. In addition, Table 2 shows little variation between images created from the training or test sets, suggesting good generalization.

ZIP Code Recognition The same system which was applied to digit pair images was also applied to the real-world ZIP codes provided by the United States Postal Service. The system was able to correctly classify 66.0% of the 540 test images. <p> The system, as implemented, can hardly hope to classify an image containing a stray blotch or an ascender (descender) correctly, since it is forced to generate an extra digit classification.

We feel that a device such as the CRD may be quite useful in combination with other segmentation approaches, since it is capable of producing a good estimate of the region of overlap between digits.
