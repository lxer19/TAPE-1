Abstract: Software components for embedded reactive real-time applications must satisfy tight code size and run-time constraints. Cooperating Finite State Machines provide a convenient intermediate format for embedded system co-synthesis, between high-level specification languages and software or hardware implementations. We propose a software generation methodology that takes advantage of the very restricted class of specifications and allows for tight control over the implementation cost. The methodology exploits several techniques from the domain of Boolean function optimization. We also describe how the simplified control/data-flow graph used as an intermediate representation can be used to accurately estimate the size and timing cost of the final executable code.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 describes the s-graph synthesis and optimization procedure. Section 5 shows some experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. 2 Preliminaries 2.1 Previous Work Previous approaches to automated code generation for reactive real-time systems have started either from synchronous programming languages (e.g., Esterel, <ref> [BCG91] </ref>), or from other high-level languages ([CWB94, GJM94]). In the first case, the main problem is the identification of a single FSM equivalent to the Esterel specification, and its efficient implementation as a software program.

Compilation into machine code to be run on the target processor. Step 1 uses Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs, <ref> [Bry86] </ref>) as an intermediate representation, to generate a very fast initial s-graph, potentially at the expense of code size. <p> satisfaction of short term timing constraints (e.g., those dictated by a specific interface protocol implemented directly in software) which may be more difficult to satisfy with classical scheduling techniques (designed for long term response and input rate constraints). 2.2 Binary Decision Diagrams and Character istic Functions A Binary-Decision Diagram (BDD, <ref> [Bry86] </ref>) is an efficient representation for storing and manipulating Boolean functions. A BDD is a directed acyclic graph with a root node for each output function and leaf nodes representing the value of each function for each input minterm.

Reference-contexts: Finite State Machines (FSMs) provide a convenient and common mechanism for specifying the intended behavior of such systems. Although we use the Codesign Finite State Machine (CFSM) model defined in <ref> [CGH + 94a] </ref> for the sake of explanation, our results can be applied to any FSM-based specification. The use of FSMs for embedded control specification offers several advantages over apparently more powerful formalisms (such as unrestricted programming languages). <p> More precisely, an input variable x j belongs to the support of y i if S x j y i (x 1 ; : : : x n ) 6= y i (x 1 ; : : : x n ). 2.3 Codesign Finite State Machines According to <ref> [CGH + 94a] </ref>, a CFSM is a reactive Finite State Machine with a set of input and output events. Events are entities that may occur at determinate instants of time and may or may not carry a value (cfr. the notion of signal in Esterel).

Reference-contexts: The difference is that we can take advantage of the large body of research about scheduling for real-time systems (e.g., [LL73]) for the second step. On the other hand, some of the algorithms of <ref> [GJM94] </ref> can also be used to perform a preliminary optimization before our synthesis algorithm.

Reference-contexts: For this reason, it is very important to have a small BDD representing the transition function. Dynamic variable reordering is run to locally optimize the BDD size. The reordering is done with the sift algorithm <ref> [Rud93] </ref>, which sifts one variable at a time up and down in the ordering and freezes it in the position where the BDD size is minimized (with the constraint that no output can sift before any input in its support).
