Title: What's Next? Sequence Queries  
Author: Raghu Ramakrishnan Michael Cheng Miron Livny Praveen Seshadri

Abstract: In this paper, our goal is primarily to motivate the importance of sequence query processing, and to discuss why current systems are unsatisfactory. We illustrate some of the technical challenges in developing suitable systems through examples. We also outline some of the work that we are doing in this area in the SEQ project at Wisconsin. This includes a model of sequence data and a framework for the optimization of sequence queries based on several novel techniques, and a framework for visual querying of sequence data. These ideas are currently being implemented in the SEQ and DEVISE systems.

Reference-contexts: Many of the algorithms proposed for problems such as mining for association rules <ref> [AIS93] </ref> involve sequence data manipulation, and we believe that SEQ provides an excellent platform for implementing such algorithms. SEQ also offers a promising approach for implementing many of the functionalities offered by statistical data analysis packages such as S in an environment where the data is disk-resident.

Reference-contexts: In this aspect, it has been influenced by the model of Time Sequences in [SS87, SK86]. Research into sequence data in contexts other than temporal data include [GJS92], [Ric92], and [SP90]. Finally, a number of specialized access structures proposed for temporal data are relevant to sequence query processing (e.g., <ref> [EWK90, LS89, RS87] </ref>). On the visualization side, software packages such as AVS, IDL, and Khoros are quite successful at visualizing data from physical phenomena such as data from weather patterns, terrain maps, or medical images. However, they are currently not suitable for visualizing sequence data originating from complex systems.

There are two important kinds of sequences in the model: * Base sequences: A base sequence is specified by an explicit set of records, each containing a position attribute. For simplicity, assume that a position is essentially a positive integer.

Reference-contexts: Example 4.1 Consider the volcano example again, expressed in SQL: SELECT V.name FROM Volcanos V, Earthquakes E WHERE E.strength &gt; 7.0 AND E.time = (SELECT max (E1.time) FROM Earthquakes E1 WHERE E1.time &lt; V.time) A conventional relational query optimizer as described in <ref> [SMALP79] </ref> would probably generate the following query evaluation plan. For every Volcano tuple in the outer query, the sub-query would be invoked to find the time of the most recent earthquake. Each such access to the subquery involves an aggregate over the entire Earthquake relation.
