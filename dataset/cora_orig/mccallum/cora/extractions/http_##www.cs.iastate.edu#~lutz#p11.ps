Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of ESPACE under nonuniform Turing reductions that are computed by polynomial-size circuits (P/Poly-Turing reductions). A Small Span Theorem is proven for such reductions. This result says that every language A in ESPACE satisfies at least one of the following two conditions.

Reference-contexts: As noted earlier, P=Poly T -reductions are nonuniform Turing reductions that are computed by polynomial-size circuits. These reductions are "combinatorially efficient," even though they need not be algorithmically computable. As noted by Skyum and Valiant <ref> [21] </ref>, the investigation of nonuniform reductions sheds light on the "purely combinatorial" aspects of the completeness phenomenon. More importantly, P=Poly T -reductions are adaptive. In fact, the present result is the first instance of a Small Span Theorem for adaptive reductions.
