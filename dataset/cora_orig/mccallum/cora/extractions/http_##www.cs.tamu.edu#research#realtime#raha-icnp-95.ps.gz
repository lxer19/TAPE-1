Abstract: This paper considers the support of hard real-time connections in ATM networks. In an ATM network, a set of hard real-time connections can be admitted only if the worst case end-to-end delays of cells belonging to individual connections are less than their deadlines. Although there are several approaches to manage the network resources in order to meet the delay requirements of connections, we focus on the use of traffic regulation to achieve this objective. Leaky buckets provide simple and user-programmable means of traffic regulation. We design and analyze an efficient optimal algorithm for selecting the burst parameters of leaky buckets to meet connections' deadlines. Our algorithm is optimal in the sense that it always selects burst parameters to meet the delay requirements of hard real-time connections whenever some such assignment exists. The exponential size of the search space makes this problem a challenging one. Our algorithm is efficient and we observe a dramatic improvement in the system performance in terms of the connection admission probability when traffic is regulated using our algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Drawing on the similarities with CPU scheduling, classical real-time scheduling policies such as the First Come First Serve (FCFS), Earliest Deadline First (EDF), Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS), Fair Queuing (FQ), etc., are employed <ref> [1, 10, 15] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Each of the network components traversed by a connection's cells can be modeled as a server. Thus, a connection can be considered to be a stream of cells being served by a sequence of servers <ref> [2, 12] </ref>. Servers can be classified as constant servers and variable servers. A constant server is one that offers a fixed delay to an arriving cell. For example, physical links are con-sidered as constant servers.

Reference-contexts: The results presented in this paper are directly applicable to currently available ATM networks without making any modifications to the hardware and are compatible with the ATM standards. We evaluate the system's capability to support hard real-time connections in terms of a metric called admission probability <ref> [12] </ref>. Admission probability is the probability of meeting the end-to-end deadlines of a set of randomly chosen connections. We observe that the admission probability increases with a proper choice of leaky bucket parameters at the UNI. <p> Hence, in this paper, we consider FCFS scheduling policy for HRT connections. 2.2 Connection model Typically, an HRT system operates in a modal fashion; i.e., the system operates in one of the several possible modes at any given instant <ref> [12] </ref>. During each mode a specific set of tasks needs to be executed for the successful operation of the system in that mode. This has an important implication for ATM networks catering to HRT systems. <p> Each of the network components traversed by a connection's cells can be modeled as a server. Thus, a connection can be considered to be a stream of cells being served by a sequence of servers <ref> [2, 12] </ref>. Servers can be classified as constant servers and variable servers. A constant server is one that offers a fixed delay to an arriving cell. For example, physical links are con-sidered as constant servers.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we use a procedure to compute d i for each of the three traffic descriptors that has been studied and analyzed in <ref> [13] </ref>. 3 Problem definition In this section, we formally define the problem of leaky bucket parameter selection for HRT ATM networks. <p> The proof of this theorem (and each of the subsequent theorems in this subsection) is not provided due to lack of space. The reader is referred to <ref> [13] </ref> for the proof. THEOREM 4.1 Given any connection M i , there exists a constant fi max i , such that increasing fi i beyond 1 For the procedure to compute the worst case end-to-end delay of connections, please refer [13]. <p> The reader is referred to <ref> [13] </ref> for the proof. THEOREM 4.1 Given any connection M i , there exists a constant fi max i , such that increasing fi i beyond 1 For the procedure to compute the worst case end-to-end delay of connections, please refer [13]. <p> ~ fi vectors, can be bounded; we only need to consider ~ fi vectors that satisfy ~ fi ~ fi max ; where ~ fi max (fi max 2 ; : : : ; fi max i may be computed from the traffic description of M i is discussed in <ref> [13] </ref>. Thus, for a given set M, ~ fi max can be precomputed. Consider, the example in Figure 1. If we assume that ~ fi max = &lt; 1; 2; 3 &gt;, then after applying Theorem 4.1 we get another graph shown in Figure 3. <p> However, in Figure 8 (a), i.e., when the periodic traffic descriptor is used, System A performs better than systems B1 and B2 for higher values of U . For a detailed analysis of this phenomenon, see <ref> [13] </ref>. Generally speaking, these results further strengthen the need for a good ~ fi selection algorithm. <p> Further, since our approach is independent of the switch architecture and the scheduling policy used at the ATM switches, it complements the performance gain achieved by any scheduling policy. This is a preliminary study on real-time communications over ATM networks. Many extensions are possible. In <ref> [13] </ref>, we consider further pruning of the search space that can be achieved by accounting for the buffer space limitations at leaky buckets. We are at present studying the performance gain that can be attained when our leaky bucket parameter selection algorithm is used with scheduling policies other than FCFS.
