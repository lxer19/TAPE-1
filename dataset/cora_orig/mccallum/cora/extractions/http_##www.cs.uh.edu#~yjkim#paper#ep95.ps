Title: Multi-rule-set Decision-making Schemes for a Genetic Algorithm Learning Environ ment for Classification Tasks  
Author: Yeong-Joon Kim and Christoph F. Eick 
Abstract: Over the last three years, we developed an inductive learning environment called DELVAUX for classification tasks that learns PROSPECTOR-style, Bayesian rules from sets of examples, using a genetic algorithm to evolve a population consists of rule-sets. Several problems complicate the search for the best rule-set. First, the search space that is explored by DELVAUX is enormously large, which makes it difficult to predict if a particular solution is a good solution. The second problem is the problem of convergence with outliers that perform well in training but not in testing. This paper describes efforts to alleviate these two problems centering on multi-rule-set learning techniques that learn multiple rule-sets and proposes several decision-making schemes that are employed by the multi-rule-set learning environment to derive a decision. Empirical results are presented that compare the single rule-set learning environment of DELVAUX with several multi-rule-set learning environments that use different decision-making schemes. Moreover, a more sophisticated fitness function for the multi-rule-set learning approach is introduced, and a genetic algorithm approach that finds the "best" multi-rule-set for a given set of rule-sets is discussed.

Reference-contexts: The idea we present in this section is to cope with these two problems by using more reliable decision-making schemes that involve multiple rule-sets instead of a single rule-set. This idea was inspired by discussion with Philip K. Chan about multi-layered decision-making schemes in their meta-learning research <ref> (Chan and Stolfo 1993) </ref>. More specifically, we can easily obtain different rule-sets for the same training data set by running our learning algorithms multiple times with different random seeds. This enables us to obtain multiple rule-sets for the same training set.

Reference-contexts: These rule sets are then applied to examples belonging the test set, evaluating the quality of the rules learned by our machine learning techniques. DELVAUX employs genetic algorithms to learn Bayesian rules for classification tasks. Bayesian Rules and Odds-Multipliers A Short Review In general, our approach learns PROSPECTOR-style rules <ref> (Duda et al. 1976) </ref> that have the form: syntax: If E then H with S = s; N = n In the above, S and N are odds-multipliers, measuring the sufficiency and necessity of E for H.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION Extracting rules from experts is quite complicated and time-consuming, especially if their decision-making uses approximate reasoning techniques <ref> (Eick and Mehta 1993) </ref>. Consequently, it appears attractive to explore if machine learning techniques could be helpful to facilitate this task.

Reference-contexts: Selection is made inversely proportional to the rule's performance in a rule-set so that a rule with worse performance has a higher probability to be selected. For this purpose, a rule evaluation technique for fuzzy Bayesian rules called reward punishment mechanism <ref> (Eick and Toto 1994) </ref> was developed. To help the mutation operator in the rule generation process, a heuristic approach based on statistics was developed so that the mutation operator generates a rule more intelligently using statistical information. <p> If we employ genetic algorithms to find the best multi-rule-set the performance increases even further by 2%. In general, the empirical results we obtained with the DELVAUX environment are encouraging we already achieved a learning performance that is comparable to various neural network approaches for a large benchmark <ref> (Eick et al. 1994) </ref> even without the improvements described in this paper. There are still various problems that deserve further exploration. First, further research should be performed to find a better fitness function for the evidence combination scheme.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, the rules learned in our approach are analytical and static, providing positive or negative evidence for the proposition that a given example belongs to a particular class. Second, in their approach a population consists of rules <ref> (the so-called Michigan approach, Goldberg 1989) </ref>, whereas in our rule learning system members of the population are complete rule-sets and not single rules (the so-called Pittsburgh approach, Smith 1980). Learning rule-sets from sets of examples offers several challenges.

Reference-contexts: In these systems, populations consist of a single rule-set, rules are evaluated in light of the well-known bucket brigade algorithm <ref> (Holland 1986) </ref>, and new populations are generated by applying genetic operators, such as crossover and mutation, to the current population. But the rules learned by traditional classifier systems are purely symbolic and rely on two-valued classical logic their left-hand side is either true or false.
