Abstract: Rainbow is a prototype optical metropolitan area network (MAN) developed at IBM. It employs wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) on a fiber-optic, passive-star network topology, with each station equipped with a laser, which is fixed tuned to its own unique wavelength, and a Fabry-Perot filter, which is tunable across all wavelengths. This paper presents a model and analysis of the protocol used in the Rainbow prototype using the equilibrium point analysis (EPA) technique. We examine the system's throughput and how it is affected by various system parameters such as message arrival rate, message length, and timeout duration. We show that, for a given arrival rate, there is a timeout duration that will yield the optimal throughput. The analytical results are verified by simulation. Keywords: Rainbow, Optical Network, Wavelength Division Multiplexing, Medium-Access Protocol, Equilibrium Point Analysis.

Reference-contexts: One solution to this problem is wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) in which the entire optical fiber's bandwidth is divided into a number of independent channels, each employing a different optical wavelength <ref> [1] </ref>. In a single-hop WDM system, stations communicate directly with one another without requiring that their information pass through any intermediate stations. The transmitter of the sending station and the receiver of the receiving station must both be tuned to the same wavelength in order for communications to take place.

In our current setting of the Rainbow protocol, although a station's receiver is performing a round robin operation, that operation may be interrupted by the station's transmitter. "Vacation models" do not appear to be applicable here because the system's performance characteristics are now determined by the transmission ("vacation") process.
