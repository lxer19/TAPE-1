Abstract: In order to reduce interconnection delay and increase packaging density, the multichip module (MCM) technology is used in the design of high-performance VLSI systems. A commonly used method for multilayer MCM designs is the three-dimensional (3D) maze routing, which suffers from a number of problems: it is very sensitive to the net ordering, it requires long computation time, and it often results in a large number of vias in the routing solutions. The objective of this research is to develop an efficient multilayer general area router as an alternative to the 3D maze router for solving the multilayer MCM routing problem. Our router, named SLICE, is independent of net ordering, requires much shorter computation time, and uses fewer vias. A key step in our router is to compute a maximum non-crossing bipartite matching, which is solved optimally in O (n logn ) time where n is the number of possible connections. We tested our router on a number of examples, including two MCM designs from MCC. The total wirelength used by SLICE is only a few percent away from the optimal on average. Compared with a 3D maze router, SLICE is six times faster and uses 29% fewer vias. Another feature of SLICE is that it works on only a "thin slice" of a two-layer routing grid at a time, while a 3D maze router works on the entire three dimensional routing grid. Therefore, SLICE can successfully produce solutions for large MCM routing examples where 3D maze routers fail due to insufficient memory.

The pads are brought to the the first signal routing layer either directly through distribution vias or through one or more redistribution layers. The redistribution layers are required when the pads are too dense to be connected directly to the signal routing layers.

Reference-contexts: First, MCMs may have far more interconnection layers than ICs. For example, the multi-chip module developed for the IBM 3081 mainframe has 33 layers of molybdenum conductors (including 1 bonding layer, 5 distribution layers, 16 interconnection layers, 8 voltage reference layers, and 3 power distribution layers <ref> [4, 5] </ref>). Fujitsu's latest supercomputer, the VP-2000, uses a ceramic substrate with over 50 interconnection layers [6]. Moreover, unlike routing in ICs where the entire routing region can be naturally decomposed into channels and switchboxes, there is no natural routing hierarchy in MCM routing.

Reference-contexts: Nets are first assigned to x -y layer pairs and then two-layer routing is carried out for each x -y layer pair (the x-layer runs horizontal wires and the y-layer runs vertical wires) <ref> [8] </ref>. Although this approach is efficient, it faces a few problems. First we have to pre-determine the number of the routing layers before we can carry out layer assignment. Moreover, the approach does not take advantage of the existence of the large number of routing layers.

Reference-contexts: The redistribution layers are required when the pads are too dense to be connected directly to the signal routing layers. A pin redistribution algorithm was presented in <ref> [12] </ref>. The goal of our MCM router is to complete the connections for the I/O terminals in each net using the signal routing layers in the substrate. The signal routing layers in the substrate are numbered from top to bottom. <p> For edges in S fall , the procedure is similar except that routing along the y-axis is always downward. 3.3. Pin redistribution Another feature of the SLICE router is that it redistributes terminals during the routing process to avoid local congestion. Unlike the pin redistribution algorithm presented in <ref> [12] </ref>, our pin redistribution process is interleaved with the routing process. At the end of planar routing of each layer, a pin redistribution step is performed.

Reference-contexts: Vias may be stacked on top of each other to connect wires in non-adjacent layers. Stacked vias can be formed in several ways, e.g., by filling the etched via with nickel in the AT&T AVP process or by plating copper posts as in -4- the MCC process <ref> [13] </ref>. Fig. 1 shows a cross section of a sample four layer routing region. The output of the routing problem is a set of routing segments and vias that connect each net.

Reference-contexts: Also, according to Lemma 1, the dominance relation is transitive. Therefore, the point set P (S ) with the dominance relation forms a partially ordered set <ref> [14] </ref>. According to the definition of the dominance relation, it is easy to verify that two edges in M are non-crossing if and only if the two corresponding points in P (M ) are related by the dominance relation (i.e., one dominates the other).

Reference-contexts: However, since the procedure for computing a maximum weighted non-crossing matching will be used for every column-pair, we seek for a more efficient implementation. We have developed an O (n logn ) time algorithm for computing the MWNCM based on a data structure called the priority search tree <ref> [16] </ref>. Before we describe the algorithm in detail, we first state a lemma: Lemma 2 Suppose that each point in P has a positive weight.

Experimental results show that on the average, more than 49% of the jogs can be removed by our algorithms. 4. Experimental Results We implemented SLICE on the Sun workstations using the C language.
