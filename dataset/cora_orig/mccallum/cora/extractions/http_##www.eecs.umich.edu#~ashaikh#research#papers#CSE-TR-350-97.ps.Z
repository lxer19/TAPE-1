Abstract: Quality-of-service (QoS) routing can satisfy application performance requirements and optimize network resource usage by selecting paths based on connection traffic parameters and link load information. However, effective path-selection schemes require the distribution of link-state information, which can cause a significant burden on the bandwidth and processing resources in the network. We investigate the fundamental tension between network overheads and the quality of routing decisions in the context of source-directed QoS routing algorithms. In contrast to previous performance studies that compare different routing algorithms under specific network configurations, we characterize how the performance and overheads of QoS routing relate to the link-state update policies, as a function of the underlying traffic load, network topology, and link-cost metrics. We explore the interplay between stale link-state information and random fluctuations in traffic load through a broad set of simulation experiments on a parameterized model of QoS routing. These results suggest ways to tune the frequency of link-state update messages and the link-cost functions to strike a careful balance between high accuracy and low complexity.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The migration to integrated networks for voice, data, and multimedia applications introduces new challenges in supporting predictable communication performance. To accommodate diverse traffic characteristics and quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, these emerging networks can employ a variety of mechanisms to control access to shared link, buffer, and processing resources <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. These mechanisms include traffic shaping and flow control to regulate an individual traffic stream, as well as link scheduling and buffer management to coordinate resource sharing at the packet or cell level.
