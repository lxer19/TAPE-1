Abstract: In his study of Newton's root approximation method, Smale (1985) defined the Newto-nian graph of a complex univariate polynomial f . The vertices of this graph are the roots of f and f 0 and the edges are the degenerate curves of flow of the Newtonian vector field N f (z) = f(z)=f 0 (z). The embedded edges of this graph form the boundaries of root basins in Newton's root approximation method. The graph defines a treelike relation on the roots of f and f 0 , similar to the linear order when f has only real roots. We give an efficient algebraic algorithm based on cell decomposition to compute the Newtonian graph. The resulting structure can be used to query whether two points in C are in the same basin. This gives us a modified version of Newton's method in which one can test whether a step has crossed a basin boundary.
