Abstract: A confusing array of new wireless untethered communications services, for voice and data, in real-time or delayed, interactive or one-way, in-building or out-of-doors, are rapidly becoming available. In this paper, we argue that despite the widely varying issues of engineering that span the creation of these diverse wireless services, the unique underlying aspect is that they must be able to adapt to a constantly changing environment brought on by mobility. Mobile systems must be able to detect their transmission environment and exploit knowledge about its current situation, so-called situation awareness, to improve the quality of communications. Handoff in cellular phone systems is one example of detection and reaction to the environment. A more pervasive understanding of how to exploit adaptation and situation awareness will be the challenge, especially as systems transition from communica tions to more general wireless information systems.

Reference-contexts: Motorolas Altair system operates at 18 Ghz (a special pioneer frequency allocation made solely to Motorola), uses time division multiplexing, and implements the Ethernet protocols including TCP/IP. It Adaptation and Mobility in Wireless Information Systems August 18, 1995 16 has been benchmarked at 3.3 Mbps <ref> [Berline 92] </ref>, despite a claimed maximum performance of 15 Mbps [Freeburg 91]. Motorola attributes several advantages to using this microwave frequency band, including good signal diffusion properties coupled with containment within building structures and avoidance of interference with commonly encountered office equipment. <p> NCRs WaveLAN system uses spread spectrum techniques, operates in the ISM band at 900 Mhz, and implements Ethernet media access and the popular personal computer Netware protocols. It has been benchmarked at 2 Mbps <ref> [Berline 92] </ref>. However to achieve these throughputs, the system must use the entire ISM band, making it more susceptible to interference, and short spreading codes, decreasing its immunity to co-channel interference.

Reference-contexts: For example, progressive image techniques will make it possible to receive a low resolution image first, with progressively better image quality should more bandwidth be available. New concepts for energy-efficient querying and data transmission are also under development. For example, Imielinski <ref> [Imielinski 92] </ref> describes an innovative energy-efficient scheme for wireless data transmission based on broadcast and asymmetric communications. If a mobiles request for a particular piece of information need not be satisfied immediately, it can transmit its request at low power and low bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: Voice communication is connection-oriented, requiring rigorous controls on latency, while data communication is more bursty and is well-suited to packetization. Even attempts to layer data communications onto the latest generation digital spread spectrum cellular systems have not yielded very high data bandwidth <ref> [Karn 93] </ref>. All too often Personal Communications Systems is synonymous with little more than ubiquitous cordless phones. Computer companies have not solved this problem either.

Reference-contexts: The only feasible way to provide such guarantees appears to be through connection-oriented services combined with stream buffering in the base stations. But these are expensive to tear down and reestablish when a mobile host moves from the range of one base station into another. <ref> [Keeton 93] </ref> describes several schemes for partially reestablishing connections while forwarding buffered data from the old base station to the new one.

Base Station The base station design issues include wireline/wireless protocol conversion, ruggedized packaging (at least for base stations to be located out-of-doors), real-time software, network-capable high performance components, and decentralized intelligence and control.

Reference-contexts: These are outlined below: Expensive Switches : The MTSO coordinates all switch functions, performs all switching of calls, and provides the service features implemented by software. The MTSO also makes the power control decisions, to avoid saturating the receiver amplifier and to reduce the chance of interference <ref> [Lee 89] </ref>. These offices cost several million dollars apiece. Dumb Base Stations : These do little processing on their own except to locate mobiles and provide the signal conversion between the wireless cellular environment and the wireline switched telephone sys tem. Large Antennas : Antenna height is approximately 40 meters.

Reference-contexts: The major radio engineering problem faced by the mobile terminal is that of multipath fading.This falls into two classes: short-term long-term <ref> [Lee 93] </ref>. The short-term fading is caused by multipath reections of a transmitted waves by local scatterers such as houses, buildings, and other man-made structures. Long-term fading, sometimes called radio shadows, is caused by terrain contours like mountains that can lead to signal drop outs. <p> The idea is to provide two or more inputs at the mobile terminal so that the fading phenomena are uncorrelated. Examples include antenna space, frequency, polarization, field component, angle, or time Adaptation and Mobility in Wireless Information Systems August 18, 1995 7 diversity combined with combining techniques <ref> [Lee 93] </ref>. Recent terminal designs are investigating embedding multiple antennas into the packaging of the mobile host. Long-term fading can sometimes be dealt with by multiple antenna sites within the cell or sharing of frequencies amongst cells, especially as is possible in spread spectrum techniques (see Section 3.3). 3.3. <p> A strong signal received from near-in mobile terminal may mask a weak signal from one that is far away. The adaptive power control scheme can insure that all transmitted signals are at the same level within the cell <ref> [Lee 93] </ref>. In addition, the scheme supports soft handoff , so called because a given terminal can communicate with more than one base station at a time, choosing to communicate with the one with the highest perceived power.

Reference-contexts: The distinction between communications and computing will continue to blur, leading to the new field of telecomputing . For example, a variety of popular wireless electronic mail systems have recently appeared, exploiting their own radio infrastructures. These include ARDIS, EMBARC, and RAM Mobile Data <ref> [Mello 93] </ref>. However, in this paper, our focus is on the challenges of providing high quality communications to computing systems in a mobile environment.

Reference-contexts: At the heart of the terminal is a high degree of processing made possible by application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), providing a mixed analog/digital capability. For low power, CMOS circuitry is preferred <ref> [Min 93] </ref>. Millimeter microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) technology may make possible small formfactor radio devices for higher frequency ranges. It is more likely that MMICs will be used in the transmitter infrastructure than in the mobile devices. Embedded software implements the various control functions of the mobile terminal.

Reference-contexts: More recent proposals are based on techniques that cache forwarding information in the network gateways, establishing the forwarding path only once per sender. This makes it possible for the packets to take an almost direct route to the mobile node <ref> [Perkins 92, Perkins 93] </ref>. However this approach leads to increased network latency, which is intolerable for those communication streams like video and audio that require real time delivery guarantees.
