Title: Abstract  
Keyword: image-guided surgery, accuracy validation, surface-based registration, accuracy metrics, fiducial marker design.  
Abstract: Validating the accuracy of image-guided surgical systems is a challenging and important problem which has received little attention in the literature. Potential sources of inaccuracy include: CT imaging noise, model generation errors, errors introduced by fixturing, intra-operative data noise, registration errors, and inaccuracies in surgical tools and actions. In this paper, we discuss our experience in validating an example image-guided application in orthopaedic surgery. Various sources of inaccuracy are identified and approaches for mitigating their effects are suggested. The difficult problem of generating a reliable ground-truth for evaluating the accuracy of surgical registration is discussed, and surface-based registration accuracy results are presented. A fiducial marker design which can be used to establish highly accurate ground-truth correspondence between pre and intra-operative data is offered. Finally, the need for better accuracy met-rics in image-guided surgery is noted, and shortcomings of metrics which are commonly used in the literature are illustrated.

Reference-contexts: Noise present in this data will have a potentially harmful effect upon registration accuracy. Several types of sensors have been used for acquiring intra-operative registration data.

Reference-contexts: Manually specified anatomical landmark correspondence provides one way to establish initial pose estimates. When good initial pose estimates are not available, precautions should be taken to ensure convergence to the global minima <ref> [2] </ref>. Careful selection of intra-operative data can in crease the sensitivity of the registration cost metric, and thus the resulting accuracy [22]. This is especially important when limited amounts of data are available, or the costs of data acquisition are high.

Reference-contexts: The average distance error was 0.1mm while the maximum distance error was 0.15mm. We also performed fiducial registration between the two data sets using the technique described in <ref> [9] </ref>. The resulting maximum residual error was 0.11mm, while the RMS residual error was 0.08mm. This sub-voxel accuracy was sufficient for our application and verifies the strength of the fiducial design and localization method.

Reference-contexts: The challenge is to minimize the amount of CT data acquired (and thus radiation exposure to the patient) while ensuring sufficient accuracy of the resulting surface models. 3.2 Surface Model Generation Errors Although there exist many techniques for creating surface models from medical images <ref> [12] </ref>, little has been published about the validation of surface model accuracy. In medicine, surface models were originally used for diagnostic visualization tasks in which visual appearance, not geometric accura cy, was important. With the recent expansion of image--guided surgical techniques, surface model accuracy has taken on new importance [5][19].

Reference-contexts: The second goal is to understand how each of the component processes contribute to the final error. The remainder of this section discusses each of the aforementioned error sources. 3.1 CT Imaging Errors During CT image creation, there are many opportunities for added error or noise <ref> [13] </ref>. Limitations in spatial and contrast resolution place bounds on the veracity of the resulting images. Artifacts caused by phenomena such as beam hardening, partial voluming and patient motion can make it difficult to interpret the underlying data. <p> Rather, large quantities of data are used to infer a fixed point (i.e. centroid of a sphere, apex of a cone). In CT, we observe that most of the error in locating a fiducial is due to beam-hardening and partial volume artifacts <ref> [13] </ref>. To limit the effects of partial voluming (which occurs when an image voxel only partially contains the fiducial), it is desirable to minimize the relative number of voxels on the surface of the fiducial.

Using a hollow cylindrical probe tip such as the one shown in Figure 5, a pivoting calibration <ref> [18] </ref> can be performed using a fiducial to provide the center of rotation. After calibration, the sensor will directly measure sphere centroids when the probe tip is mated to the sphere surface. By acquiring a large number of data points (e.g 15), very good centroid estimates are possible.

Initially, pre-operative data are acquired from the relevant patient anatomy. In our application, this data is acquired from a CT imager. <p> Each of these processes are performed off-line, before surgery. During surgery, the operations in the lower half of Figure 1 are performed. First, the relevant patient anatomy is either: 1) rigidly fixtured to prevent motion, as in <ref> [24] </ref>, or 2) affixed with a tracking device that will allow the system to compensate for motion, as in [4][15]. Second, registration data are acquired from the relevant anatomy using a suitable sensor (e.g. digitizing probe, ultrasound). <p> If there is movement between the anatomy and the fixation device or target, the registration result is no longer valid. Sensitive motion detectors can be used to insure that there is no motion between the anatomy and a fixed coordinate system <ref> [24] </ref>. This technique is less practical when the tracking method is used. Guaranteeing that a tracking target has not moved relative to the anatomy during surgery (e.g. from contact with the surgeon) is difficult, since it is impossible to differentiate motions of the target from motions of the anatomy. <p> Several types of sensors have been used for acquiring intra-operative registration data. Research groups have reported on the use of: XRay imagers [14], ultrasonic sensors [1], optical digitizers [4][15][21][22], mechanical digitizers [10], optical range imagers [6][20][22], video cameras [3], and robots <ref> [24] </ref>.
