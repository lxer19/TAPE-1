Title: A Condition Guaranteeing the Existence of Higher-Dimensional Constrained Delaunay Triangulations

Abstract: Let X be a complex of vertices and piecewise linear constraining facets embedded in E d . Say that a simplex is strongly Delaunay if its vertices are in X and there exists a sphere that passes through its vertices but passes through and encloses no other vertex. Then X has a d-dimensional constrained Delaunay triangulation if each k-dimensional constraining facet in X with k d 2 is a union of strongly Delaunay k-simplices. This theorem is especially useful in E 3 for forming tetrahe-dralizations that respect specified planar facets. If the bounding segments of these facets are subdivided so that the subsegments are strongly Delaunay, then a constrained tetrahedralization exists. Hence, fewer vertices are needed than in the most common practice in the literature, wherein additional vertices are inserted in the relative interiors of facets to form a conforming (but unconstrained) Delaunay tetrahedralization.

Reference-contexts: Not every PSLG requires this many augmenting vertices, but the numbers required in practice may nonetheless seem undesirably large for some applications. The second alternative is to form a constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT) <ref> [1] </ref> (Figure 1, lower right). A CDT of X has no vertices not in X, and every segment of X is a single edge of a PSLG (upper left) might not respect the segments of the PSLG.

Reference-contexts: of vertices), the procedure must terminate; and since the procedure will not terminate unless the current d-simplex contains p, there exists a Delaunay d-simplex that contains p. ffi This procedure is recognizable as the basis for a well-known algorithm, called gift-wrapping, graph traversal, or incremental search, for constructing Delaunay triangulations <ref> [2] </ref>. Gift-wrapping begins by finding a single Delaunay d-simplex, which is used as a seed upon which the remaining Delaunay d-simplices crystallize one by one. <p> For instance, the sophisticated search algorithm and analysis techniques applied by Dwyer <ref> [2] </ref> to unconstrained gift-wrapping might be generalizable to the constrained case as well. Here, I offer a few practical suggestions without asymptotic guar-antees.

The proof given here is much simpler.

I believe that his conclusion is incorrect in the case of simplices that share a common circumsphere. the boundary of the occluding facet.

Reference-contexts: Edelsbrunner and Tan <ref> [4] </ref> show that any PSLG can be triangulated with the addition of no more than O (m 2 n) augmenting vertices, where m is the number of segments in X, and n is the number of vertices. <p> Additionally, cospherical or nearly-cospherical vertices create the need for exact arithmetic when performing the insphere tests associated with Delaunay triangulation. 4 Conclusions In their paper on two-dimensional conforming Delaunay triangulations, Edelsbrunner and Tan <ref> [4] </ref> write: A seemingly difficult open problem is the generalization of our polynomial bound to three dimensions. The somewhat easier version of the generalized problem considers a graph whose vertices are embedded as points in R 3 , and edges are represented by straight line segments connecting embedded vertices.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1 Let p be any point in the convex hull of X. If X is ridge-protected, then some constrained Delaunay d-simplex of X contains p. Proof: The proof is based on a two-stage constructive procedure similar to one used by Fortune <ref> [5] </ref> to prove the existence of unconstrained Delaunay triangulations. The first stage finds an arbitrary constrained Delaunay d-simplex, and involves d + 1 steps, numbered zero through d. For step zero, define a sphere S whose center is an arbitrary vertex v 0 in X, and whose radius is zero.

Reference-contexts: The result of this paper implies that the CDT of Y may be formed without adding any more vertices to Y . This idea stands in apposition to the most common method of recovering unrepresented facets in three-dimensional Delaunay-based mesh generation algorithms <ref> [14, 6, 15, 10] </ref>, wherein additional vertices are inserted within the facet (for instance, where an edge of the tetrahedraliza-tion intersects the missing facet).

Reference-contexts: However, a conforming Delaunay triangulation's triangles are Delaunay, but those of a CDT are not. Nevertheless, a CDT retains many of the desirable properties of Delaunay triangulations. For instance, a two-dimensional CDT maximizes the minimum angle in the triangulation, compared with all other constrained triangulations of X <ref> [7] </ref>. Unfortunately, CDTs have not been generalized to dimensions higher than two. One reason is that in three or more dimensions, there are polytopes that cannot be triangulated at all without additional vertices. Schonhardt [12] furnishes a three-dimensional example depicted in Figure 3 (right).

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, there are useful consequences to this guarantee. The input for which a triangulation is sought is called a piecewise linear complex (PLC), following Miller, Talmor, Teng, Walk-ington, and Wang <ref> [8] </ref>. Before considering PLCs in their full generality, consider the special case in which a PLC X is a set of vertices and constraining simplices in E d . Each constraining simplex is a k-dimensional simplex (henceforth, k-simplex) having k + 1 affinely independent vertices, where 1 k d 1. <p> Two facets, if one is not a boundary facet of the other, may intersect only at shared lower-dimensional facets and vertices. See Miller et al. <ref> [8] </ref> for a complete list of restrictions. The advantage of employing whole facets, rather than individual constraining simplices, is that only the lower-dimensional boundary facets of a (d 1)-facet need be included in the PLC (including interior boundaries, at holes and slits).

Reference-contexts: Several other questions also deserve investigation. Are there higher-dimensional constrained Delaunay triangulation algorithms that have the same running time as optimal algorithms for unconstrained Delaunay triangulations? Do higher-dimensional CDTs have optimality properties such as minimizing the largest min-containment sphere, as higher-dimensional Delaunay triangulations do <ref> [9] </ref>? Is there a less conservative definition of constrained De-launay (perhaps allowing visibility to be affected by constraining simplices of dimension less than d 1) that defines triangulations over a larger class of PLCs?

Reference-contexts: Any four vertices of the polyhedron include two separated by a reflex edge; thus, any tetrahedron whose vertices are vertices of the polyhedron will not lie entirely within the polyhedron. Therefore, Sch onhardt's polyhedron cannot be tetrahedralized without additional vertices. Ruppert and Seidel <ref> [11] </ref> add to the difficulty by proving that it is NP-hard to determine whether a polyhedron is tetrahedralizable.

Reference-contexts: Because the latter can be converted into a CCDT, the former may not be needed. The utility of the CCDT is further buttressed by a practical algorithm for three-dimensional mesh generation that I describe elsewhere <ref> [13] </ref>. One variant of the Delaunay refinement algorithm described therein uses the constrained Delaunay property of the tetrahedra it produces to prove guaranteed bounds on the quality of the final mesh. <p> The ability to incrementally insert and delete vertices is also useful for mesh generation, especially in circumstances where the constrained Delaunay property can be used to establish provable properties of the meshing algorithm <ref> [13] </ref>. Unfortunately, subsets of d + 2 or more cospherical vertices can cause real difficulties for gift-wrapping. A gift-wrapping algorithm may make decisions that are mutually inconsistent, and find itself unable to complete the triangulation.
