Abstract: Modern computing systems exploit graphical user interfaces for interaction with users. As a result, introductory computer science courses must begin to teach the principles underlying such interfaces. This paper presents an approach to graphical user interface implementation that is simple enough for beginning students to understand, yet rich enough to demonstrate many important concepts and tradeoffs in computer science.

Reference-contexts: The library of macros supports the MOTIF GUI interface standard, but could easily be converted to support other GUI standards. The macro calls and conventions will be described in the context of an implementation of Conways Game of Life <ref> (Conway, 1970) </ref>, a programming exercise found in many introductory texts. The macro library has been used in teaching the second computer science course at Rensselaer.

Reference-contexts: In the CS1 course that we are teaching, we are approaching the teaching of this material via an integration with extensive case studies. The GUI toolkit is part of a larger project to develop an online hypermedia textbook <ref> (Skolnick & Spooner 1994) </ref> for introductory computer science courses for both majors and nonmajors. This hypermedia textbook combines science and engineering case studies with workstation-based computing concepts and tools to provide students with the computing knowledge they need to successfully apply computing in their own disciplines.
