Abstract: We present a new approach to the tracking of very non rigid patterns of motion, such as water flowing down a stream. The algorithm is based on a "disturbance map," which is obtained by linearly subtracting the temporal average of the previous frames from the new frame. Every local motion creates one disturbance having the form of a wave, with a "head" at the present position of the object and a historical "tail" that indicates the previous positions of that object. These disturbances serve as loci of attraction for "tracking particles" that are scattered throughout the image. The shape of the disturbance wave does not depend on the object's shape; by tracking along these waves good separation is achieved between different objects, and very stable tracking is obtained even when there are many complex trajectories. The method enables us to track occluded objects, as well as to simultaneously contend with a large number of independently moving objects. Our method does not employ any restrictions at all regarding the magnitude of the changes that can occur in the shape of the objects or restrictions on the magnitude of their motion. It does not require smooth trajectories, and it does not rely on stability of the velocity. The algorithm is very fast and can be performed in real time. We provide excellent tracking results on various complex sequences, using both stabilized and moving cameras, showing: a busy ant column, waterfalls, rapids and flowing streams, shoppers in a mall, and cars in a traffic intersection.

Reference-contexts: Exploring other applications, many attempts have been made to reliably track pedestrians. These efforts span a range of techniques, from the use of contours, through the tracking of representative points in joints, and on to the use of complex models of a person walking. For example, <ref> [6] </ref> used a cubic B-spline representation for the contours of a moving image (these contours are obtained by subtracting pictures of the background that were photographed in advance).

Reference-contexts: These assumptions do not hold in many cases. An attempt to extend the approach to cases of large deformation can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. The idea here was to replace the constraint of small changes by a physical or geometric model of the phenomenon that we wish to study. <p> The only methods that are not based on the assumption of slow changes, such as the method described in <ref> [7] </ref>, require a geometric model that is confined to very specific cases.
