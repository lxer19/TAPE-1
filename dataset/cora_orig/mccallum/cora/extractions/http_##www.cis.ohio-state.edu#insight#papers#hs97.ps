Abstract: We describe the Phase-Space Nonlinear Control Toolbox, a suite of computational tools for synthesizing and evaluating control laws for a broad class of nonlinear dynamical systems. The Toolbox comprises computational algorithms for identifying optimal control reference trajectories in the phase space of dynamical systems and experimental methods for evaluating performance of the control laws. These algorithms combine knowledge of the geometric theory of modern nonlinear dynamical systems with efficient computational methods for geometric reasoning and graph search; they define the properties of controllability and robustness in terms of phase-space geometric structures and exploit the phase-space neighborhood adjacencies to obtain computational efficiency. Compared to the traditional analytic control design methods, the phase-space based control synthesis and evaluation rely on high-performance computational techniques and are applicable to physical systems operating in large nonlinear regimes. Using a proof-of-concept physical experiment for stabilizing a nonlinear magnetic levitation system, we have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the phase-space control technology.

Reference-contexts: Our phase-space control algorithm goes a major step beyond the cell-based analysis. We had previously developed a phase-space control framework for exploiting phase-space global knowledge to obtain high-quality control design <ref> (Bradley & Zhao 1993) </ref>. This work focuses on developing practical methods and implementations for the phase-space control technology. We use the cell decomposition as a first order approximation to the phase-space geometry to develop practical control synthesis and evaluation methods.

Reference-contexts: The Maglev Control Experiment Magnetically levitated vehicles such as the German Transrapid train (Figure 2 (a)) require active suspension technology that maintains a constant air gap and dampens disturbances caused by road irregularities and wind loads <ref> (Eastham 1989) </ref>. Figure 2 (b) shows a maglev vehicle and guideway system with active primary and secondary suspensions (McCallum & others 1992). In such a system, the control objective for the active suspension system is to ensure a good ride quality for passengers on realistic guideway systems.

Reference-contexts: Notice that the global controller is able to bring the trajectory back to equilibrium after an initial disturbance. trol generalizes the decomposition process to permit a systematic computational exploration. Hsu developed a cell-based method called cell-to-cell mapping for approximating state spaces <ref> (Hsu 1987) </ref>. A continuous state space is discretized into regular cells forming a cell space. The associated map of a system becomes a cell-to-cell map which maps one cell to another cell.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, nonlinear control lacks general methods that provide a unified treatment of and approach to a wide class of nonlinear systems. Recent theoretical work on the controllability of nonlinear systems that employs a differential geomet-ric approach is still far from being practical <ref> (Isidori 1985) </ref>. Conventional analytical methods have two important limitations: they require accurate models and labor-intensive simulation and calibration. As an example of a nonlinear control system, we examine the well-studied control problem for legged robots.

Reference-contexts: We have focused on developing practical algorithms for synthesizing control actions for nonlinear systems, using phase space as a geometric model. We have also characterized the computational complexity for a restricted class of hybrid systems <ref> (Kolen & Zhao 1997) </ref>. Recently, neural net technology has been successfully applied to the control of highly nonlinear systems. In one case, a neural net is used to model the inverse dynamics of a high-performance fighter jet in order to produce high-quality control design (Totah 1996).

Reference-contexts: The hopping motion of a legged robot can be described as a limit cycle in a phase space of position and velocity, with distinct points (events) delineating phases such as lift-off, touch-down, or flight phase of the motion <ref> (Raibert 1986) </ref>. The behaviors of the robot are characterized by the number and shapes of the limit cycle.

Reference-contexts: Using the phase-space performance evaluation method, the controllable region for the global controller is depicted in Figure 10. Related work The field of nonlinear control has developed a rich collection of design methods that apply to specific classes of problems <ref> (Slotine & Li 1991) </ref>. For instance, methods of linearization and describing functions generalize linear techniques to nonlinear systems. The technique of gain scheduling, for example, approximates a nonlinear control system with a piecewise-linear one and designs a linear controller for each linear piece.

In one case, a neural net is used to model the inverse dynamics of a high-performance fighter jet in order to produce high-quality control design <ref> (Totah 1996) </ref>. However, one major drawback of the neural-net based controller is its lack of stability and performance guarantee required by the FAA certification process. The tools described in this paper can computationally characterize operational properties of these nonlinear controllers that are not amenable to traditional analytical analysis.

Reference-contexts: The phase-space control is applicable to a broad class of physical systems operating in large nonlinear regimes, for which conventional linear, analytic methods are ill-suited. The rapid advances in information processing, micro-fabrication, and MEMS are fueling a new generation of distributed autonomous systems <ref> (Williams & Nayak 1996) </ref>. Our abilities to sense and act in the complex physical environments are increasingly augmented by massive networks of tiny, invisible sensors, actuators, and computers embedded in everything from appliances to materials to building structures.
