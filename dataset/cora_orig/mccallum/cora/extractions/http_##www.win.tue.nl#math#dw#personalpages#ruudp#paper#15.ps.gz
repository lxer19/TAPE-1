Title: On decoding by error location and dependent sets of error positions  
Author: Ruud Pellikaan 
Date: 106/107 (1992), 369-381.  
Note: Appeared in: Discrete Math.  
Abstract: We generalize the existing decoding algorithms by error location for BCH and algebraic-geometric codes to arbitrary linear codes. We investigate the number of dependent sets of error positions. A received word with an independent set of error positions can be corrected.

Reference-contexts: If w is a word with error e supported at I, then Ker (E w )=A (I) = eA I " (B I ) ? ; and Ker (E w ) = A (I) if and only if eA I " B ? I = 0: Proof. See <ref> [2, Proposition 4] </ref>. Consider the bilinear form S on AfiB defined by S (a; b) = P e i a i b i . <p> Thus there exists a t-error correcting pair, by Corollary 3.2. 2 Remark 3.4 The above algorithm is called the "basic algorithm" in [16, 20]. With the so called "modified algorithm" <ref> [8, 2] </ref> more errors can be decoded. There exist about 2g error locating pairs such that one can decode b (d fl 1)=2c errors, see [14, 21]. But this is an existence result. <p> If one decodes with the "modified algorithm", that is with several error locating pairs, then the decoding failure is considerably lower, as is shown by Duursma <ref> [2, Proposition 5] </ref> in an example. Proposition 4.8 If B is a linear code in F n q of dimension t, then dep (B; t) (n t + 1)(q + 2) n ! Proof.

Reference-contexts: Thus the number of 2-dependent sets of C r is equal to r 2 i 2 . So in case r = 2 there are 4 dependent 2-sets. This is in agreement with ff 2 (C ? 2 )=(q 1) = 4, by Remark 4.3 and <ref> [17, Example 2.8] </ref>. 3) The code C r+1 has dimension 3. <p> Thus in total there are r 2 i 3 + (r 4 r 3 ) r+1 j dependent 3-sets. So in case r = 2 there are 8 dependent 3-sets. This is in agreement with ff 3 (C ? 3 )=(q 1) = 8, by Remark 4.3 and <ref> [17, Example 2.8] </ref>. In case r &gt; 2 we do not know the weight enumerator to compare. 4) Let t = l+2 j and l r. The code C l (r+1) has dimension t.
