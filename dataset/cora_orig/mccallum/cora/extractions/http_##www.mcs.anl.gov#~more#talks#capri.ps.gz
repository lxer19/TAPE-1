Abstract: We are developing an environment for large scale optimization problems that only requires the user to provide code to evaluate f . * Develop code to evaluate f * Decide on the software Conjugate gradient methods Limited memory VM methods - Matrix-free Newton methods - Newton methods * Retrieve the software * Hand-code the gradient * Determine the sparsity pattern * Compile, debug, compile, debug, : : : run * Interpret the results * Repeat the process
