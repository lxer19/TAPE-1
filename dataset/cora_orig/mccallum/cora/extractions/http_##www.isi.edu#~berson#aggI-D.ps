Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress." Abstract The Internet Integrated Services (IIS) architecture[4] has a fundamental scaling problem in that per flow state is maintained at all routers and end-systems supporting a flow. This draft examines the use of aggregation as a technique to reduce the amount of state needed to provide IIS, and describes the modifications to RSVP to support aggregation. In our approach, routers at the edge of a region doing aggregation keep detailed IIS state, while in the interior of this region, routers keep a greatly reduced amount of state. Packets will be tagged at the edge with scheduling information that will be used in place of the detailed IIS state. The aggregation scheme described will allow large scale deployment of IIS without overloading routers with state and associated processing.

Reference-contexts: Third, there is the state for the setup protocol, e.g. state carried in RSVP PATH and RESV messages. Finally, current multicast routing algorithms also store state, either per source and session (e.g. DVMRP [9], PIM-DM [5]) or per session shared-tree (e.g. CBT <ref> [1] </ref>, PIM-SM [5]). While approaches to aggregation of routing state are similar to aggregation of IIS state, they are beyond the scope of this draft. Per session state in a router has two detrimental effects.

First, additional state consumes memory, and second, additional state requires additional CPU cycles to process the state.

Reference-contexts: Scheduler state typically takes the form of different traffic classes. These traffic classes are assigned different priorities, link shares <ref> [6] </ref>, and policing policies to provide a certain level of service. In the basic IIS model, each traffic flow gets its own traffic class, meaning that each flow has certain resources dedicated to it.

Reference-contexts: This draft describes how to provide Internet Integrated Services for both unicast and multicast traffic with greatly reduced state requirements. We concentrate primarily on Controlled Load type service [10], which reserves bandwidth but not delay or jitter, though our approach should be more generally applicable (see <ref> [7] </ref> for a related approach). With our approach, the amount of scheduler state is bounded at all nodes for both unicast and multicast traffic. For unicast traffic, full classifier state and setup protocol state are stored only at the edges of the network.

Reference-contexts: In the absence of setup protocol state, admission control decisions can be made only on the basis of the reservation request control message and load measurements on the router. We call this type of admission control measurement based admission control <ref> [8] </ref>. Setup protocol state is also used for traffic policing. Policing is done in an IIS network at traffic merge points and at traffic split points. A traffic merge point (see Figure 1a) is where the traffic from two or more sources for the same session merge. <p> Other approaches involve detection at the egress of abusive behavior, and cancelling the offending reservation. 3 RSVP operations/extensions In this section we describe how this aggregation scheme would be applied to RSVP. We assume that a measurement based admission control algorithm <ref> [8] </ref> is defined, and we describe how to utilize this system to implement aggregation.

Reference-contexts: Classifier state is used to assign each arriving packet to a packet scheduling queue for forwarding. Third, there is the state for the setup protocol, e.g. state carried in RSVP PATH and RESV messages. Finally, current multicast routing algorithms also store state, either per source and session (e.g. DVMRP <ref> [9] </ref>, PIM-DM [5]) or per session shared-tree (e.g. CBT [1], PIM-SM [5]). While approaches to aggregation of routing state are similar to aggregation of IIS state, they are beyond the scope of this draft. Per session state in a router has two detrimental effects.
