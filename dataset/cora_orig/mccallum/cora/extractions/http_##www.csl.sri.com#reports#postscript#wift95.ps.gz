Abstract: This paper describes the experiences of Collins Commercial Avionics and SRI International in formally specifying and verifying the microcode for the AAMP5 microprocessor with the PVS verification system. This project was conducted to determine if an industrial microprocessor designed for use in real-time embedded systems could be formally specified at the instruction set and register transfer levels and if formal proofs could be used to prove the microcode correct. The paper provides a brief technical overview, but its emphasis is on the lessons learned in using PVS for an example of this size and the implications for using formal methods in an industrial setting. Software and digital hardware are increasingly being used in situations where failure could be life threatening, such as aircraft, nuclear power plants, weapon systems, and medical instrumentation. Several authors have demonstrated the infeasibility of showing that such systems meet ultra-high reliability requirements through testing alone [flfifl]. Formal methods are a promising approach for increasing our confidence in digital systems, but many questions remain on how it can be used effectively in an industrial setting. While this paper includes a brief technical overview (see [28,29] for a detailed technical discussion), its emphasis is on the lessons learned in using PVS for an example of this size and the implications for using formal methods in an industrial setting. The central result of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of formally specifying a commercial microprocessor and the use of mechanical proofs of correctness to verify microcode. This is particularly significant since the AAMP5 was not designed for formal verification, but to provide a more than three fold performance improvement, by pipelining instruction execution, while remaining object code compatible with the earlier AAMP2. As a consequence, the AAMP5 is one of the most complex microprocessors to which formal methods have been applied. Another key result was the discovery of both actual and seeded errors. Two actual microcode errors were discovered and corrected during development of the formal specification, illustrating the value of simply creating a precise specification. Two seeded errors were systematically uncovered while doing correctness proofs. One of these was an actual error that had been discovered after first fabrication but left in the microcode provided to SRI. The other error was designed to be unlikely to be detected by walkthroughs, testing, or simulation. Several other results emerged during the project, including the ease with which practicing engineers became
