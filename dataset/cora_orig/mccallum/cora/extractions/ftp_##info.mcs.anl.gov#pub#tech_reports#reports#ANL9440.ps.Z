Reference-contexts: In a simple example consider the unit square divided into two triangles. The input information for DDGridCreateTriangles could be given by nv = 4; x [2] = 0.0; y [2] = 1.0; x [3] = 1.0; y [3] = 1.0; nodes [0] = 0; nodes <ref> [1] </ref> = 1; nodes [2] = 2; nodes [3] = 3; nodes [4] = 2; nodes [5] = 1; bn = 4; bnd [4] = 3; bnd [5] = 2; bnd [6] = 2; bnd [7] = 0; The third technique for creating triangular grids in the Extensible PDE Solvers package <p> Several of the examples demonstrate this capability. 4.1 Classical Solvers The command DDDomainSolverSolve has access to all of the linear system solvers in the Simplified Linear Equation Solvers (SLES) component of PETSc <ref> [1] </ref>.
