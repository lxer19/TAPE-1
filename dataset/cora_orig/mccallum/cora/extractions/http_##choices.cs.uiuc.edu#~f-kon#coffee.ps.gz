Reference-contexts: Object-oriented languages and type-safe languages have already been used for network operating system implementations by CHOICES [CIMR93] and SPIN <ref> [BSea95] </ref> respectively. 2 Since Java was first released, a series of security flaws have been found and CoffeePot may be affected by a subset of these problems.

Reference-contexts: is also very difficult for one object to corrupt private data of another object or class 2 . 2 Related Work The concepts of extensibility and flexibility and the implementation of file systems and network protocols at user-level have been exhaustively experienced mainly by microkernel developers like the MACH group <ref> [CDK95] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The idea of supporting an environment in which protocols like FTP could be accessed through a common file-system-like interface was previously addressed by the Prospero project <ref> [Neu92] </ref>. 3 The Coffee Pot File System The Coffe Pot File System can be used to access different local and remote services through a common interface.

Reference-contexts: In future versions, a virtual file system layer which would provide a uniform naming scheme may be added. 4 The FTP Implementation FTP is the Internet standard for file transfer. Its official specification is given in the RFC 959 <ref> [PR85] </ref>. The FTP protocol uses two TCP/IP connections. The control connection is initiated by the FTP client which connects to a previously defined server port (port 21 is the default).
