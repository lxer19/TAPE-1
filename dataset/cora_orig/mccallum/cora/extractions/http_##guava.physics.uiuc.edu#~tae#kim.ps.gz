Title: Dynamics of Free Dendritic Growth  
Author: Yung-Tae Kim 
Date: May 5, 1998  
Abstract: The purpose of this essay is to provide an overview of the dynamics of pattern formation in solidifying systems. The primary focus is dendritic crystallization during the solidification of a pure melt. A review is given of the classic experiments performed on succinonitrile. The standard model of solidification is then introduced and the steady state Ivantsov solution is discussed. The use of the marginal stability hypothesis and solvability theory to investigate the actual operating state (growth rate and shape) of dendrites is summarized. The essay concludes with a discussion of the use of phase-field models to numerically simulate dentritic growth.

Taken from <ref> [8] </ref>. 2 are made when a metal is solidified from its melt: millions of tiny metal-lic snowflakes grow from the molten stuff, Figure 2.
