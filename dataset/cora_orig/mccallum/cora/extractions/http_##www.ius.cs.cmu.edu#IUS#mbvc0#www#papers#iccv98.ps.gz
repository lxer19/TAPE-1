Abstract: In this paper we present a unified factorization algorithm for recovering structure and motion from image sequences by using point features, line segments and planes. This new formulation is based on directional uncertainty model for features. Points and line segments are both described by the same probabilistic models and so can be recovered in the same way. Prior information on the coplanarity of features is shown to fit naturally into the new factorization formulation and provides additional constraints for the shape recovery. This formulation leads to a weighted least squares motion and shape recovery problem which is solved by an efficient quasi-linear algorithm. The statistical uncertainty model also enables us to recover uncertainty estimates for the reconstructed three dimensional feature locations.

Reference-contexts: Since then research has shifted to the more difficult multiple-image problem where more data samples can lead to greater accuracy which is our motivation. Much current work focusses on recovering shape using a full perspective camera model <ref> [1, 3, 14, 15, 20] </ref>. Solving the perspective equations typically entails non-linear minimization and the usual problems of many local minima, and high computational expense, with convergence and accuracy being sensitive to special parameters and initial guesses.

Our algorithm provides an uncertainty measure for the resulting shape features. Recent work with line features <ref> [4, 12, 18] </ref> illustrates that, while lines provide valuable constraints for shape recovery, the reconstruction process using them is more sensitive to noise and being trapped by local minima than for point features.

Reference-contexts: While we also recover camera motion, in this report we focus on 3D structure. Further, we require that the solution be robust to the inevitable imprecision and small errors involved in imaging and registration. Early structure from motion work focused on the two image problem <ref> [5, 17] </ref>. Starting from a set of corresponding features in the images, the camera motion and point locations could be recovered. Since then research has shifted to the more difficult multiple-image problem where more data samples can lead to greater accuracy which is our motivation.
