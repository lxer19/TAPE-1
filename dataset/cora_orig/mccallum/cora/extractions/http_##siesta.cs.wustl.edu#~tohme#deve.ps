Abstract: Until recent years Development Economics could not find the ap-propiate formal tools for the representation and analysis of development processes. As it is clear now, qualitative changes, working on the structure of economic systems, can be better represented and highlighted in non-linear frameworks. Following that insight, in this paper we will present a model in which several sectors interact. The output of each sector depends on the demands of its production, being the response function, expressing the output in terms of those demands, highly non-linear with a treshold value, after which it shows a mono-tonical increase. To analyze the behavior of the system we perform numerical experiments in order to show how the degree of development evolves. Several features usually assumed in Development Theory can be shown as grounded in a very simple non-linear model with a very simple characterization. fl Work supported by the SCyT of the U.N.S. under the grant ZE10.

Reference-contexts: economic policies aimed at reaching the highest degree of de velopment 1 Roughly speaking, a spin-glasses model is one in which each point in a lattice can be in one of several states, and changes of state are a result of its previous state and those of its neighbors (see <ref> [3] </ref>) The area of Growth Theory is widely formalized, including the increas-ingly relevant subfield of Endogenous Growth. Models attempting to represent this kind of growth phenomena are aimed at giving explanations for the residual in Solow's equation.

Reference-contexts: Models attempting to represent this kind of growth phenomena are aimed at giving explanations for the residual in Solow's equation. The evolution of the Product determines, and is also a consequence of the rate of technical progress <ref> [4] </ref>. Suggestions for policies can be derived, in this framework, for less advanced economies [5],[6]. In the area of Development Theory, given the definition of degree of development, it becomes necessary to introduce studies of the behavior of the Potential as well as of the Actual Product.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, a great number of empirical studies emphasize on the causes which determine a certain degree of development <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Despite the fact that more empirical study is required to understand the features of development processes, in this work the goal is to state a model able to explain certain general facts about those processes (see <ref> [8] </ref> for a discussion of the relevance of a formal approach to development). 2 The Model: Concepts Following Olivera ([9]), we define the degree of development of a system and its rate of variation as: ffP P = P A Dlogff + DlogP P = DlogP A where: * ff: degree

Reference-contexts: The second strong assumption about the response functions is that the underlying costs are not convex when aggregate demands are small. This may obey to indivisibilities which at large demands become smoothed out. As a consequence, in low ranges, responses will be non-linear <ref> [10] </ref>. At larger demands, instead, the smoothing out of indivisibilities allow a monotonicity in responses. Moreover, we assume that in such a situation expectations will be of growth and in similar lines to the permanent income hypothesis [11]- responses will be linear.

Reference-contexts: But, as the system is represented by a family of partial-difference equations, it is not possible to find analytical solutions. In these cases it is helpful to simulate the model (see <ref> [12] </ref>), giving values to its parameters, obtaining through a very simple numerical integration the desired trajectories.

Reference-contexts: These results are reminiscent of the hypothesis of disequilibred growth, where the existence of disequilibria is a condition for the advance of the economy <ref> [13] </ref>, [14]. The initial disparities are not a requirement for this behavior. Experiment 1 shows that a homogenously developed economy can grow in the first stages and without demand shocks it declines to degrees below the initial values.
