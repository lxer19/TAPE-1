Abstract: Material classification is a key step in creating computer graphics models and images from volume data. We present a new algorithm for identifying the distribution of different material types in volumetric datasets such as those produced with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT). The algorithm assumes that voxels can contain more than one material, e.g. both muscle and fat; we wish to compute the relative proportion of each material in the voxels. Other classification methods have utilized Gaussian probability density functions to model the distribution of values within a dataset. These Gaussian basis functions work well for voxels with unmixed materials, but do not work well where the materials are mixed together. We extend this approach by deriving non-Gaussian mixture basis functions. We treat a voxel as a volume, not as a single point. We use the distribution of values within each voxel-sized volume to identify materials within the voxel using a probabilistic approach.

Reference-contexts: Because the data collection process blends together measurements of more than one material at points near boundaries, this assumption is not always accurate (see Figure 2). <ref> [Drebin88] </ref> mentions the need for mixture classification. He approximates the relative volume of materials represented by a sample as the probability that the sample is each material. As he points out, this works reasonably well for differentiating air, soft tissue, and bone in CT data, but not in general.

Reference-contexts: Our technique identifies materials in sampled volume data producing a new sampled volume dataset for each material. to us because it is relatively non-invasive, and it measures chemical properties uniformly. Previous Work. There has been much work done on material classification in sampled datasets <ref> [Duda73] </ref>, but many of the techniques introduce classification artifacts, particularly on boundaries between different materials. These artifacts, which tend to be jaggy-like stair-steps or additional surfaces, are particularly visible in computer graphics images and models.

Reference-contexts: With more measurement dimensions in the dataset, collinear-ity is less frequent for most combinations of materials, although classification works as for scalar-valued data. Our approach. In this paper we build on a statistical framework, using Bayesian probability theory and approximations of conditional and prior probabilities <ref> [Loredo] </ref> to calculate the probability of a particular mixture of materials given the histogram of a voxel-sized region. We then find the most likely mixture for the region. In calculating histograms, we reconstruct the continuous function, band-limited to the Nyquist frequency, from the samples.

Reference-contexts: For many types of medical imaging data, including MRI and CT, these assumptions hold reasonably well, or can be satisfied sufficiently with preprocessing <ref> [ThesisXX] </ref>. Other types of sampled data, e.g. ultrasound, and video or film images with lighting and shading, violate these assumptions,and our technique does not apply directly. Sketch of Derivation.

Reference-contexts: In MR data the expected data value for one material may often be identical to the expected value for a mixture of two other materials. We address this problem further below. Replacing point samples with histograms. <ref> [Choi91] </ref> presents a method that models each sample as representing a mixture of materials. This technique, like many others, classifies a region based on a single measurement within the region, effectively treating each voxel as a single point. Instead, we treat each voxel as a volume.

Reference-contexts: Identifying different materials within these sampled datasets is an important step in this process (see Figure 1). By finding materials we wish to identify as parts, or to emphasize or deemphasize, we can better control a volume-rendered image <ref> [Levoy 88] </ref>, a surface model [Lorensen and Cline 87], or a volume model created from the data. Applications of these models and images include surgical planning and assistance, conventional computer animation, anatomical studies, and predictive modeling of complex biological shapes and behavior.

Reference-contexts: Implementation. Our implementation is written in C and C++ on Unix workstations. We use a sequential quadratic programming constrained optimization algorithm <ref> [NAG] </ref> to fit h vox for each voxel-sized region, and a quasi-Newton optimization algorithm for fitting h .
