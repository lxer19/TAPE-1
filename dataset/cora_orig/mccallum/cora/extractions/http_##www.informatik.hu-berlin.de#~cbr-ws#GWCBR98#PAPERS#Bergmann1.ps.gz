Abstract: This paper presents a brief overview of the INRECA-II methodology for building and maintaining CBR applications. It is based on the experience factory and the software process modeling approach from software engineering. CBR development and maintenance experience is documented using software process models and stored in a three-layered experience packet.

Reference-contexts: The result is an inefficient or ineffective system development, which cannot be sustained by contemporary organizations. From these problems, the need for a methodology to support the development and maintenance of CBR applications arson a few years ago and several approaches in that direction have been proposes <ref> (see Bergmann et al., 1997, for an overview) </ref>. A methodology describes the development of a software system using a systematic and disciplined approach.

Reference-contexts: A complex method decomposes a process into a set of sub-processes that exchange certain byproducts in the course of achieving the goal of the main process. For a detailed description of the software process modeling approach used in the INRECA-II methodology see <ref> (Bergmann et al. 1997b) </ref>. In the INRECA-II methodology, software process models are used to represent the CBR development experience that is stored in the experience packet.

Reference-contexts: Current Status Up to now, the INRECA-II project has achieved an initial experience packet <ref> (Bergmann et al. 1997c, Bergmann et al. 1997d) </ref> and a first revision of. Currently, the common generic level, consists of about 150 different sheets documenting technical, organizational and managerial aspects.

Reference-contexts: This paper describes the INRECA-II 1 methodology approach which is based on two relatively new areas in software engineering (SE): experience factory <ref> (Basili, Caldiera, & Rombach, 1994) </ref> and software process modeling (Rombach & Verlage, 1995). We developed a methodology based on recent SE techniques which is enriched by up to date experience on building and maintaining CBR applications. <p> The main product of an experience Generalise Tailor Formalise Package Characterize, Set Goals, Choose Process Execute Process Project Support Analyse Experience Packet execution plans Lessons Learned Experience in Models Project Organisation Experience Factory Fig. 1. The Experience Factory Approach <ref> (Basili, Caldiera, & Rombach, 1994) </ref> factory is an experience packet. The content and the structure of an experience packet vary based upon the kind of experience clustered in the packet.
