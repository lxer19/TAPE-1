Abstract: IDA Technical Report 1995 LiTH-IDA-R-95-02 ISSN-0281-4250 Department of Computer and Information Science, Linkoping University, S-581 83 Linkoping, Sweden Epistemic Entrenchment and Abstract The Possible Models Approach (PMA) introduced by Winslett, proposes, among other things, a domain-independent criterion for measuring the similarity between the different states of a dynamic system. Based on this criterion of similarity, the PMA makes inferences about the effects of events in the system. The concept of similarity between states (possible worlds) appears also in the area of Belief Revision in the form of a system of spheres. Systems of spheres are in turn connected to epistemic entrenchments by means of the AGM revision functions that the two structures induce. In view of these connections, in this article we identify and study the properties of the family of epistemic entrenchments corresponding to systems of spheres that comply with PMA's criterion of similarity. Using the results established herein, we then outline a version of the PMA based on epistemic entrenchments. the Possible Models Approach

Reference-contexts: Much of the research in the area is based on the work of Alchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson <ref> [1] </ref> who have proposed and investigated a set of postulates, widely known as the AGM postulate, which appear to capture much of what characterizes rational belief revision. <p> Theorem 5.2 Let and 0 be two epistemic entrenchments satisfying (EP1) - (EP2) (in addition to (EE1) - (EE5)). Then = 0 iff =A = 0 =A. Proof. In proving Theorem 5.2 we will make use of the connection established by Rott [8], between epistemic entrenchments and hierarchies <ref> [1] </ref>. We shall briefly review the relative results before proceeding with our proof. A hierarchy over a theory T is an acyclic binary relation over T (i.e. if ' 1 ' 2 ' n then ' n 6 ' 1 ). <p> Finally a hierarchy is said to be virtually connected over T iff for all '; ; ~ 2 T , if ' then '~ or ~ . Based on the notion of a hierarchy over a theory T , Alchourron and Makinson <ref> [1] </ref> provide yet another constructive model for belief contraction (and consequently by means of the Levi Identity, for belief revision). <p> The safe contraction of T with respect to ' (modulo ) is then defined as the logical closure of fl (T ; '; ), i.e. T ' = Cn (fl (T ; '; )). In <ref> [1] </ref>, [2] Alchourron and Makinson proved a representation result that was later generalized by Rott [8], according to which the safe contractions generated by regular, virtually connected hierarchies, are precisely the class of functions satisfying the AGM postulates for belief contraction.

Reference-contexts: Our first aim in this article is to formulate conditions that capture PMA's criterion of similarity in the context of systems of spheres. Then, using the connection between systems of spheres and epistemic entrenchments <ref> [4] </ref> (by means of the revision functions that the two structures induce), we will identify and study the properties of the family of epistemic entrenchments corresponding to systems of spheres that comply with PMA's criterion of similarity (we call such epistemic entrenchments PMA epistemic entrenchments). <p> This is essentially an improvement, for the class of PMA epistemic entrenchments, of an earlier result by Gardenfors and Makinson <ref> [4] </ref> according to which an arbitrary epistemic entrenchment can be specified by an ordering on the dual atoms of the language. In view of these results, in the last section of the article we discuss the the idea of an epistemic-entrenchment-based version of the PMA. <p> Apart from this axiomatic approach to belief revision, two explicit constructions of this process have been proposed, that we briefly review below. 4.1 Epistemic Entrenchments The first constructive model that we discuss has been proposed by Gardenfors and Makinson <ref> [4] </ref> and it is based on the notion of epistemic entrenchment. <p> Formally the idea of epistemic entrenchment determining the result of belief revision is captured by the following condition: (E ? ) 2 T ? ' iff either :' &lt; :' _ or ` :'. Gardenfors and Makinson <ref> [4] </ref> proved that the family of functions over theories constructed from epistemic entrenchments by means of (E ? ) is precisely the class of revision functions (i.e. the functions satisfying the AGM postulates). 3 4.2 Systems of Spheres In [5], Grove introduced another construction of a revision function that instead of <p> means of the following condition. (S ? ) T ? L otherwise Grove showed that the class of functions generated from systems of spheres by means of (S ? ) is precisely the family of revision functions (i.e. the functions satisfying the AGM postulates). 3 To be more precise, in <ref> [4] </ref> Gardenfors and Makinson established a connection between epistemic entrenchments and contraction functions. However, in view of the Levi Identity, the connection with revision functions mentioned above follows directly. 6 Let us briefly consider the intuition behind a system of spheres as a basis for constructing revision functions. <p> The importance of this class in regards to reasoning about action will be discussed in the following section. Herein we shall consider some of its formal properties. In <ref> [4] </ref>, Gardenfors and Makinson have shown that an epistemic entrenchment can be uniquely determined by its restriction to the dual atoms of the language.

Reference-contexts: We shall refer to this criterion as PMA's criterion of similarity. The concept of a similarity ordering over states (possible worlds) also appears in the area of Belief Revision, and it is formally captured by a structure called system of spheres <ref> [5] </ref>. In Belief Revision a system of spheres is used to determine the result of revising an agent's beliefs in the light of new information, pretty much in the same way that a PMA preorder is used to determine the states resulting from the occurrence of an event. <p> Gardenfors and Makinson [4] proved that the family of functions over theories constructed from epistemic entrenchments by means of (E ? ) is precisely the class of revision functions (i.e. the functions satisfying the AGM postulates). 3 4.2 Systems of Spheres In <ref> [5] </ref>, Grove introduced another construction of a revision function that instead of a preorder on sentences, it is based on a special structure on consistent complete theories, called a system of spheres. Let be a subset of K L (i.e. is a set of consistent complete theories).

Reference-contexts: In this article we take the former approach. One of the main reasons is that total PMA preorders are of particular interest in Reasoning about Action, since they satisfy the requirement of epistemological completeness proposed by Lin and Shoham <ref> [6] </ref>. Loosely speaking, this requirement says that for deterministic dynamic systems, a method for reasoning about action should be able to determine uniquely the next state of the system when given complete information about the initial state (and the occurring event).

The following result, reported in <ref> [7] </ref>, follows from the representation results connecting revision functions to systems of spheres and epistemic entrenchments.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 5.2 Let and 0 be two epistemic entrenchments satisfying (EP1) - (EP2) (in addition to (EE1) - (EE5)). Then = 0 iff =A = 0 =A. Proof. In proving Theorem 5.2 we will make use of the connection established by Rott <ref> [8] </ref>, between epistemic entrenchments and hierarchies [1]. We shall briefly review the relative results before proceeding with our proof. A hierarchy over a theory T is an acyclic binary relation over T (i.e. if ' 1 ' 2 ' n then ' n 6 ' 1 ). <p> T ' = Cn (fl (T ; '; )). In [1], [2] Alchourron and Makinson proved a representation result that was later generalized by Rott <ref> [8] </ref>, according to which the safe contractions generated by regular, virtually connected hierarchies, are precisely the class of functions satisfying the AGM postulates for belief contraction. <p> This result establishes (via the Levi Identity) an indirect connection between regular, virtually connected hierarchies and revision functions, as well as a connection between hierarchies and epistemic entrenchments. This later connection has been explored in <ref> [8] </ref>. Rephrasing these results in the present context, Rott showed (among other things) that for any epistemic entrenchment related to a theory T , the restriction of the converse complement of to T is a regular, virtually connected hierarchy over T , that generates the same revision function as .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Possible Models Approach (PMA) was introduced by Winslett in <ref> [9] </ref> as a method for dealing with the frame and ramification problems, and it was motivated by a general assumption about the dynamics of "commonsense" domains known as the Principle of Minimal Change. <p> We shall denote by min (S 0 ; ), the set of all minimal elements of a subset S 0 of S under . 3 The Possible Models Approach Consider a robot, call it Tyro (to use the same name used by Winslett <ref> [9] </ref>), that has certain information about the current state of a dynamic system, formally represented as a theory T of L. <p> In <ref> [9] </ref>, Winslett proposed a method, called the Possible Models Approach (PMA), that to some extend addresses the above problem. In this section we outline the basic ideas behind the PMA. <p> We shall call a preorder v in K L , that satisfies both (DS) and (SD), a strict PMA preorder. The plain version of the PMA <ref> [9] </ref> is in fact based on strict PMA preorders. Notice that for any state w, conditions (DS) and (SD) determine uniquely the preorder v associated with w. <p> Therefore by means of conditions (RU ) and (R v) the plain PMA can reason about the effect of events based only on their postconditions; no explicit information about the dynamic of the domain at focus needs to be provided. However, as already recognized by Winslett in <ref> [9] </ref>, the situations where strict PMA preorders capture correctly the underlying measure of similarity, are limited, and consequently the class of domains where plain PMA produces the intended inferences is restrictive. To deal with this problem Winslett introduced an updated version of the PMA, called the prioritized PMA (PPMA) [9], [11], <p> in <ref> [9] </ref>, the situations where strict PMA preorders capture correctly the underlying measure of similarity, are limited, and consequently the class of domains where plain PMA produces the intended inferences is restrictive. To deal with this problem Winslett introduced an updated version of the PMA, called the prioritized PMA (PPMA) [9], [11], where she essentially lifted the requirement (SD), allowing a wide variety of PMA preorders to be associated to a given state w, depending on the situation at hand. This made PPMA applicable to a much larger class of domains.

Reference-contexts: Another interesting direction would be to weaken appropriately the axioms for epistemic entrenchment so that the connection expressed by (E v) can be extended to partial PMA preorders as well. Finally, in view of the relation between the PMA and circumscription <ref> [10] </ref>, one may use the connections established herein to provide a characterization of circumscription in terms of epistemic entrenchment. 8 Acknowledgments I am grateful to Hans Rott for many interesting discussions on this article during my stay in Konstanz.
