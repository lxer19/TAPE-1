Abstract: In a single-hop WDM optical network, a straightforward approach to implementing multicasting is to schedule a single transmission to multiple destinations so that all of the destinations' receivers must tune to the same channel at the same time. Although scheduling a single transmission in this manner reduces the amount of transmitter and channel resources being used, it may also place a burden on the receivers in the network. If all receivers do not become available at the same time, then some receivers may have to wait (and be idle) for significantly long periods of time before receiving the message. In this paper, we investigate methods for partitioning a multicast group into a number of smaller subgroups and for scheduling a separate transmission for each of these subgroups. We show that this approach more effectively conserves and balances the usage of transmitter and receiver resources in the network and may lead to significantly improved system performance over the conventional single-transmission multicast approach.

Reference-contexts: The multihop multicasting problem is to construct a minimal cost tree which is rooted at the source node and spans all of the destination nodes. This problem has traditionally been formulated as the Steiner Minimal Tree problem and has been studied in a number of previous works <ref> [1] </ref> [2]. A problem that has received less attention is the single-hop multicasting problem. Since single-hop optical networks are based on a broadcast medium (Fig. 1), multiple destinations may receive the same transmission, thereby reducing the number of times that a message is transmitted.

Reference-contexts: In a multicast transmission, the source node must coordinate with multiple destination nodes such that the destination nodes are tuned to the appropriate channel at the appropriate time. The single-hop multicasting problem in WDM networks has been addressed in a few previous works <ref> [3] </ref> [4]. In [4], only a single transmission is scheduled for each mul-ticast message, resulting in a minimal use of bandwidth and transmitter resources. However, since receivers at each destination node may become available at different times, some nodes may have to wait longer than others to receive the message.
