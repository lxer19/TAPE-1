Title: A Neural Network Model of Memory Consolidation

Abstract: Some forms of memory rely temporarily on a system of brain structures located in the medial temporal lobe that includes the hippocampus. The recall of recent events is one task that relies crucially on the proper functioning of this system. As the event becomes less recent, the medial temporal lobe becomes less critical to the recall of the event, and the recollection appears to rely more upon the neocortex. It has been proposed that a process called consolidation is responsible for transfer of memory from the medial temporal lobe to the neocortex. We examine a network model proposed by P. Alvarez and L. Squire designed to incorporate some of the known features of consolidation, and propose several possible experiments intended to help evaluate the performance of this model under more realistic conditions. Finally, we implement an extended version of the model that can accommodate varying assumptions about the number of areas and connections within the brain and memory capacity, and examine the performance of our model on Alvarez and Squire's original task.

Reference-contexts: A desirable feature of a model of memory consolidation would be the ability to reflect both anterograde and retrograde amnesia as a result of damage to the MTL. (Alvarez and Squire 1994; Milner 1989). 2 Alvarez and Squire model P. Alvarez and L. Squire <ref> (Alvarez and Squire 1994) </ref> propose a simple model of memory; memories are initially stored in the MTL, and slowly become learned by a distributed set of neocortical structures.
