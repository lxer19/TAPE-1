Abstract: The Pierre Auger Fluorescence Detector is designed to monitor extensive air showers of energies greater than 10 19 eV. We present a trigger-system that uses configurable hardware to aquire, process and save the data from these showers. For post-processing the saved data will be transported to a central data processing host.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We are developing a trigger-system for the Fluorescence Detector proposed for the Pierre Auger Project. Our approach is based on the three-eyed detector with superman-layout and dual-mirrors as described by Paul Sommers <ref> [2] </ref>. The whole system has a modular structure and it is based on the mirror systems of every eye. We are implementing a configurable, hardware-based system in the mirrors, which allows a great variety of different parameters, for evaluating the first-level trigger.

Reference-contexts: To evaluate the event data further on every mirror system an additional controller like a DSP or neural device, for example the SAND/1-ASIC (simply application neural 2 device) <ref> [5] </ref>, is integrated. We show the first-level and the second-level trigger more detailed in the next section. Based on this structure a third-level trigger is possible working on the local eye-memory. The three eyes support the data management for storing the events and the intelligence for data exchange.
