Abstract: This is a sample latex template for abstracts submitted to the 1997 UC Davis Student Workshop on Computing. The workshop will be sponsored by the Department of Computer Science to promote an interchange of ideas among the various research activities at Davis related to computing. Students | undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral | are encouraged to submit short, 2-page abstracts of recent technical accomplishments. All submitted abstracts will be bound in a volume to be distributed at the workshop and which will later be available as a CS technical report. About 10-15 of the submitted abstracts will be selected for presentation. The first page *must* begin with a title, the author's name, and Davis and email addresses. Joint submissions are acceptable, but the student making the presentation should be listed as first author. Faculty presentations are not allowed. The abstract should describe the essential ideas in the research and have a short bibliography that includes any published papers or technical memoranda on which the abstract is based. Every abstract should have at least one figure, table, diagram, or photograph. A footnote on the bottom of the first page should acknowledge research support. one column in width. Figure 2 is an example of a figure which is two columns in width. These are cites for a book [Lei92], a conference paper [L + 92], a journal paper [Fis81], a technical report [Lei89], a thesis [Bre91], and an unpublished manuscript [CDG + 93].
