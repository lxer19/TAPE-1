Title: The Impact of External Dependency in Genetic Programming Primitives  
Author: Una-May O'Reilly

Abstract: Both control and data dependencies among primitives impact the behavioural consistency of subprograms in genetic programming solutions. Behavioural consistency in turn impacts the ability of genetic programming to identify and promote appropriate subprograms. We present the results of modelling dependency through a parameterized problem in which a subprogram exhibits internal and external dependency levels that change as the subprogram is successively incorporated into larger subsolutions. We find that the key difference between non-existent and "full" external dependency is a longer time to solution identification and a lower likelihood of success as shown by increased difficulty in identifying and promoting correct subprograms.

Reference-contexts: 1 Motivation One reason our understanding of genetic programming <ref> [Koza, 1992] </ref> is imprecise is the lack of an adequate account of how program dependencies impact the effectiveness of selection and crossover. Program dependencies can be decomposed into two classes: control and data.

Reference-contexts: A data dependency between two statements means that one statement sets up a data state (e.g. variable) which the other one subsequently needs to reference. We and others contend <ref> [O'Reilly and Oppacher, 1995, Luke and Spector, 1997] </ref> that program dependency is a key issue in GP. In our view a subprogram has both internal dependencies and external dependencies. Internal dependencies are data and control relationships that stay within the subprogram.
