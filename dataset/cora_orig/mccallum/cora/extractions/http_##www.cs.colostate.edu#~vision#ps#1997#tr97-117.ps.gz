Reference-contexts: A match is a many-to-many correspondence mapping c where: c 2 C C = 2 S S M fi D (1) An objective function E defines the best match c fl . E (c fl ) E (c) 8c 2 C (2) The match error E has two terms <ref> [ Beveridge, 1993 ] </ref> : E (c) = E fit (c) + E om (c) (3) 2 E Res (c) + E om (c) (4) E fit (c) measures how well the model fits the data.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction To find an object, recognition algorithms often first seek small sets of features which predict the object's presence. This ideas is articulated by Roberts [ Roberts, 1965 ] and is the heart of local feature focus <ref> [ Bolles and Cain, 1982 ] </ref> . It suggests the value of perceptual organization [ Lowe, 1985 ] and is fundamental to the alignment approach [ Huttenlocher and Ullman, 1990 ] .

Reference-contexts: E om (c) measures how much of the model is omitted from the match. (a) (b) b) segments <ref> [ Burns et al., 1986 ] </ref> , c) model, d) best match. To evaluate E, a 2D similarity transformation best fitting the model to the data is computed.

Reference-contexts: Randomness is important to local search because the probability of failing to find a good solution over multiple trials drops exponentially as the number of trials increases. This same random sampling methodology has been used in the RANSAC algorithm to find consistent subsets of object model and image features <ref> [ Fischler and Bolles, 1987 ] </ref> . We begin by reviewing our formulation of 2D line segment matching as a combinatorial optimization task which has as its goal finding matches such as the one shown in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: For example, the Pole is an interesting case for the key feature algorithm because of its simplicity: there exists only one possible model triple for the key feature algorithm to exploit. The Dandelion exhibits a 16 fold near symmetry; model symmetry complicates matching for many well established techniques <ref> [ Grimson, 1990 ] </ref> . The Leaf presents an example where model and data line segments approximate a curved contour. For this model, a many-to-many mapping between model and image features is needed to account for breakpoints at different positions along the curve.

[ Lowe, 1985 ] strongly advocated broad and general perceptual invariants derived from the basic rules of physics and imaging. <ref> [ Huttenlocher and Ullman, 1990 ] </ref> took a more model-based approach: predicting which features are key in part upon specific object geometry. However, both Lowe and Huttenlocher separated the task of selecting possible key features from that of matching complete models to image data.

[ Huttenlocher and Ullman, 1990 ] took a more model-based approach: predicting which features are key in part upon specific object geometry. <p> It is impractical to enumerate and rank 1; 000; 000; 000 triples; clearly, some filter must be used. We use a very general heuristic: proximal lines in a model are likely to be proximal in the data. This idea is by no means new, <ref> [ Lowe, 1985 ] </ref> suggests this approach and then dismisses it as too unfocused for his purposes. Filtering by spatial proximity will generate on the order of n ranked triples. Model and data segments are analyzed independently to find the nearest neighbors of each.
