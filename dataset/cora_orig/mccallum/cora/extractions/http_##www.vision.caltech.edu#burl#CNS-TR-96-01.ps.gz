Abstract: Users of digital image libraries are often not interested in image data per se but in derived products such as catalogs of objects of interest. Converting an image database into a usable catalog is typically carried out manually at present. For many larger image databases the purely manual approach is completely impractical. In this paper we describe the development of a trainable cataloging system: the user indicates the location of the objects of interest for a number of training images and the system learns to detect and catalog these objects in the rest of the database. In particular we describe the application of this system to the cataloging of small volcanoes in radar images of Venus. The volcano problem is of interest because of the scale (30,000 images, order of 1 million detectable volcanoes), technical difficulty (the variability of the volcanoes in appearance) and the scientific importance of the problem. The problem of uncertain or subjective ground truth is of fundamental importance in cataloging problems of this nature and is discussed in some detail. Experimental results are presented which quantify and compare the detection performance of the system relative to human detection performance. The paper concludes by discussing the limitations of the proposed system and the lessons learned of general relevance to the development of digital image libraries.

Reference-contexts: Typically these catalogs contain information about the location, size, shape, and general context of the object of interest and are published and made generally available to the planetary science community <ref> [1] </ref>. In the last 30 years remote spacecraft have provided far more detailed planetary images than were previously available, and subsequently our understanding of the physical geology of the planets has increased substantially. Nonetheless much remains to be discovered and the scientific process is ongoing. <p> Thus, the Magellan mission has provided planetary scientists with an unprecedented data set for Venus science analysis. It is anticipated that the study of the Magellan dataset will continue well into the next century <ref> [1, 9, 10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: There is currently a significant shift to computer-aided processing of planetary data, a shift which is driven by the public availability of many planetary datasets in digital form on CD-ROMS <ref> [2] </ref>. Thus far, however, the geologist's routine remains largely manual: the computer is used as a storage and display tool, but is hardly used for automated analysis. Hence, what could potentially be turned into a large digital image library is simply stored as raw image data.

Reference-contexts: Given the volume of data being collected (see for example Section 3) purely manual cataloging of objects of interest is completely impractical. Thus, as in the volcano problem discussed later, scientists are manually cataloging small portions of the dataset and inferring what they can from these data <ref> [3] </ref>. In this paper we describe a system for automatically locating small volcanoes on the surface of Venus. <p> Volcanic features are broadly distributed globally, unlike plate boundary concentrations typical of Earth. The most widespread terrain type on Venus is lowland volcanic plains. Understanding clustering characteristics and the global distribution of the volcanoes is fundamental to understanding the regional and global geologic evolution of the planet <ref> [3] </ref>. Generating a comprehensive catalog including the size, location, and other relevant information about each volcano is clearly a pre-requisite for more advanced studies such as cluster analysis of the volcano locations. <p> We will refer to these geologists as geologist A and B henceforth in this paper. Both of these geologists have extensive experience in studying both Earth-based and 6 planetary volcanism and have published some of the standard reference works on Venus volcanism <ref> [3, 11] </ref>. Hence, their collective subjective opinion is (roughly speaking) about as expert as one can find given the available data and our current state of knowledge about the planet Venus.

Reference-contexts: learned from this project and their relevance to more general digital image library problems. 2 Prior Work on Detecting Natural Objects in Remote-Sensing Data Prior work using pattern recognition with remote sensing data has largely focused on earth-based data and the classification of homogeneous regions into vegetation types (for example) <ref> [4] </ref>. Most work on the detection of objects in remotely-sensed data has largely been limited to the detection of man-made objects with well-defined edge characteristics.

Reference-contexts: Hough transform methods have been used in the past for detection of circular geologic features in SAR data <ref> [5, 6] </ref> but without great success. In the particular context of the volcano detection problem, Wiles and Forshaw [7] described a matched filtering approach for detection of small volcanoes in the Magellan data.

Reference-contexts: Hough transform methods have been used in the past for detection of circular geologic features in SAR data [5, 6] but without great success. In the particular context of the volcano detection problem, Wiles and Forshaw <ref> [7] </ref> described a matched filtering approach for detection of small volcanoes in the Magellan data. In Section 7 we will see that matched filtering alone appears insufficient to achieve high detection rates for this problem. Note also that these methods involve relatively little, if any, training based on expert-supplied data. <p> Varying this parameter generates an FROC curve for the detector alone (without the Gaussian classifier). Observe that the combination of matched filter and classification yields better performance than using only a matched filter (use of a matched filter alone was proposed in <ref> [7] </ref>). 7.5 Experimental Results on Inhomogeneous Images In this experiment 36 images were selected from random locations the planet. These 36 images contained significantly greater variety in shape, noisiness, and size than the sets of 4 and 38 used in the earlier experiments.

Reference-contexts: Magellan entered an elliptical orbit around Venus in August 1990 and subsequently transmitted back to Earth more data than that from all past planetary missions combined <ref> [8] </ref>. In particular, a set of approximately 30,000, 1024 fi 1024 pixel, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), 75m/pixel resolution images of the planet's surface were transmitted resulting in a high resolution map of 97% of the surface of Venus. <p> In Appendix 1 we describe how the data used in the experiments in this paper can be obtained. 2 3.2 The Scientific Importance of Venus Volcanism The location, identification, and cataloging of volcanoes are key components in the study of Venus. To quote Saunders et al <ref> [8] </ref>: Volcanism is the most widespread and important geologic phenomenon on Venus. Volcanic features are broadly distributed globally, unlike plate boundary concentrations typical of Earth. The most widespread terrain type on Venus is lowland volcanic plains.

Reference-contexts: Typical geophysical questions about Venus volcanism concern eruption mechanics, the relationship between volcanoes and local tectonic structure, and the pattern of heat flow within the planet. Geologists estimate the number of small volcanoes (diameter &lt; 15km) on the planet to be ~ 10 6 <ref> [11] </ref>. These volcanoes are thought to be widely scattered throughout 30,000 1Mbyte images. Manually locating these volcanoes is simply not feasible. <p> We will refer to these geologists as geologist A and B henceforth in this paper. Both of these geologists have extensive experience in studying both Earth-based and 6 planetary volcanism and have published some of the standard reference works on Venus volcanism <ref> [3, 11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A complete description of the Magellan SAR imaging system is given in <ref> [12] </ref>. A standard Magellan image consists of 1024 fi 1024 8-bit pixels, where the pixels are 75m in resolution for the results referred to in this paper. Small volcano diameters are typically in the 2-3km range, i.e., 30 to 50 pixels wide. Volcanoes are often spatially clustered in volcano fields.

Reference-contexts: Since the measured class labels are uncertain estimates of the true class labels one can take this into account during training using a standard statistical decision theory approach. It can be shown that this amounts to weighting the examples according to posterior class membership probabilities <ref> [15] </ref>: if an example has probability 0.8 of belonging to class ! 1 and probability 0.2 of belonging to class ! 2 then the example can be fractionally assigned during training to each class according to these weights.

Reference-contexts: In a logistic regression context one can use the posterior probability probabilities directly as the target values. The practical issue is that of determining the posterior class probabilities: humans are notoriously poor at providing accurate estimates of subjective probabilities <ref> [16] </ref>. In the case where there is one set of labels per image, one approach is to map the expert's categories directly to posterior probability values as described above.

Reference-contexts: Preliminary results indicate that the weighted approach provides no discernible performance improvement over the non-weighted approach but these results were based on relatively small data sets <ref> [17] </ref>,.

We have also explored a relatively simple probabilistic model which results in a composite estimate based on the labels from different experts [18]. <p> results on parameter sensitivity are reported in Section 7.6. 7.3 Experimental Results on A Small Set of Homogeneous Images In previous work we have reported the results of preliminary experiments using cross-validation on four images that contained 163 small volcanoes and covered a 150km fi 150km area of the planet <ref> [17] </ref>. The FROC result is shown in Figure 7. All results were scored relative to the geologists' consensus labeling with confidence categories 1-4 treated as true volcanoes. These 4 images were located rather close together, a factor whose importance will become important as we proceed.

In this paper we only use the relatively simple non-weighted method for training. 5.2.2 Performance Evaluation and Class Label Uncertainty The second primary issue raised by class label uncertainty is that of evaluating relative performance of both humans and algorithms. <p> However this is suboptimal in the sense that in the worst case one expert's opinion might be no better than random and performance estimates using that expert as reference should receive lower weight. We have investigated some probabilistic techniques for modelling multiple expert opinions <ref> [18] </ref> and there is a significant body of work in the statistical and biomedical literatures on this topic [27, 28, 29].

Reference-contexts: performance criteria: if a detector classifies a local region as a volcano and the region has a probability of 0.6 (according to the reference data) of being a volcano, then one could weight the performance criterion accordingly, e.g., the loss function would use the weight 0.6 in evaluating the performance <ref> [19] </ref>. In this paper we will adopt the simpler non-weighted method of performance evaluation just as we will use the non-weighted training classification training methods.

Reference-contexts: Thus, direct use of the pixels as input to a classification algorithm is not practical given the ratio of input dimensionality to the number of training examples. Experimental results with a variety of feedforward neural network classification models verified this hypothesis <ref> [20] </ref>. The training data were often linearly seperable in pixel space, resulting in an underconstrained training procedure where the model could memorize the training data perfectly but generalized poorly to unseen data.

Reference-contexts: We note in passing that the decomposition of statistical pattern recognition problems into a 2-step process, feature extraction followed by classification, has long been recognized as a necessary evil in most practical pattern recognition problems <ref> [21] </ref>. 6.1 Detection of Candidate Volcano Regions The detection component is designed to take an image as input and produce as output a list of candidate volcano locations. <p> The classifier could also be designed this way, but as shown in <ref> [21] </ref> such an algorithm is subject to considerable error even in relatively low dimensions because the location of the "other" distribution is unknown. To overcome this problem, we have experimented with various supervised two-class methods including quadratic classifiers, decision trees, nearest neighbors, kernel density estimation, and feedforward neural network models.

Reference-contexts: Applying the matched filter to an image involves computing the normalized cross-correlation of f with each k fi k image patch. The cross-correlation can be computed efficiently using separable kernel methods to approximate the 2-D kernel f as a sum of 1-D outer products <ref> [22] </ref>. High response values indicate that there is strong correlation between the filter and the image patch. A typical filter and response image are shown in Figure 4. Candidate volcano locations are placed where the matched filter response exceeds a threshold that is determined from training images.

Reference-contexts: Circles without boxes are missed volcanoes and boxes without circles are false alarms. Since the matched filter acts as prescreening for other stages, the cost of a missed volcano is high compared to a false alarm. (Karhunen-Loeve transform), and pattern recognition (Turk and Pentland <ref> [23] </ref>). The problem formulation is to find a q-dimensional subspace such that the projected data is closest in L 2 norm to the original data. The subspace we seek is spanned by the highest-eigenvalue eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix.

Reference-contexts: A practical alternative to the standard ROC (plotting detection rate versus false alarm rate) for cases such as this is the so-called "free-response" ROC (FROC) <ref> [24] </ref> which plots the detection rate against the false alarm rate per unit area. In the experimental results described in this paper we use the FROC methodology where the x-axis corresponds to false alarms per square km.

Reference-contexts: As pointed out in the paper by Geman, Bienenstock and Doursat <ref> [25] </ref>, an algorithm which learns from pixels alone is operating in such a high-dimensional space that statistical estimation theory predicts that prohibitively large amounts of training data are required to reduce the variance of the estimates, i.e., to construct an accurate detection model from data.
