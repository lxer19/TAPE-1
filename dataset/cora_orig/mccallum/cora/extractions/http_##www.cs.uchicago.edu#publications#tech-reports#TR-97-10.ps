Abstract: We propose a method for solving a model of age-dependent population diusion with random dispersal. This method, unlike previous methods, allows for variable time steps and independent age and time discretizations. We use a moving age discretization that transforms the problem to a system of parabolic equations. The system is then solved by backward dierences in time and a Galerkin approximation in space; the equations that need to be solved at each step treat each age group separately. A priori L 2 error estimates are obtained by an energy analysis. These estimates are superconvergent in the age variable. We present a postprocessing technique which capitalizes on the superconvergence. 1. Introduction. In this paper, we consider a numerical method for solving an
