Abstract: Ring network architectures that employ spatial reuse permit concurrent transmissions of messages over different links. While spatial reuse increases network throughput, it may also cause starvation of nodes. To alleviate this problem, various policies have been suggested in the literature. In this paper we concentrate on a class of such policies that achieve fairness by allocating transmission quotas to nodes. For such policies, we provide mechanisms for improving delays and increasing overall throughput without compromising fairness.

Reference-contexts: For such traffic, an appropriate throughput performance criterion for each node is the average number of packets that the node is able to transmit in the long run. Based on this performance criterion, a well known optimization problem that is associated with fairness is the max-min optimization <ref> [3] </ref>, where each node gets the largest possible throughput that does not impact nodes with lower throughputs.

Reference-contexts: The mechanism proposed in this paper, using the INFO signal, can be considered as a generalization of the mechanism proposed in [15], using the Distributor signal, in the following sense. The mechanism in [15] (see also <ref> [4] </ref> for a description and performance study of this mechanism) allows a node to identify the first downstream node whose queue is non-empty (active node) in the current SAT cycle.

Reference-contexts: SAT multiplication, on the other hand, can result in longer delays for packets of starved nodes. The multiple SAT signals can be merged when two or more reach a starved node, but this process may be slow. Faster solutions can be found in <ref> [9] </ref>. INFO multiplication is potentially more dangerous from the point-of-view of the active node counter as it may result in inconsistent increments 12 IEEE/ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING, VOL. XX, NO.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 6. Example of Potential Throughput Improvement When all nodes have equal quota, it is shown in <ref> [14] </ref> that as the quota sizes increase the SAT algorithm provides node throughputs that are converging to the point that maximizes the minimum throughput in the network. However, the SAT algorithm equalizes the throughputs of all nodes (that have enough to transmit). <p> Therefore, when ring traffic is asymmetric, a possible increase in the throughput of some nodes that could occur without penalizing other nodes, is lost. The quota adaptation algorithm improves the HOL delays of the SAT algorithm but cannot correct this throughput problem. It has been shown in <ref> [14] </ref> that the problem can be solved by allocating different quotas to nodes as a function of their traffic distribution. This may, however, not be practical as it requires knowledge of traffic statistics which may either not be available or too variable to estimate accurately.
