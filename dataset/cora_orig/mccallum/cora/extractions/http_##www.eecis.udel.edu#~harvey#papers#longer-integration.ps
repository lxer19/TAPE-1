Title: Problems in Heterogeneous Knowledge Source Integration: TraumaGEN and the Metathesaurus  
Author: Terrence G. Harvey

Abstract: This paper reports on some of the difficulties inherent in the integration of information from heterogeneous knowledge sources (KSs). It reviews the approaches and limitations of some recent systems, and presents example problems from an attempt to integrate two KSs in the medical terminology domain.

Reference-contexts: This allows the system to maintain an efficient balance when work loads change (Decker et al., 1997). 4 Other work Much work has been done in the area of integrating heterogeneous knowledge bases. Two systems, TSIMMIS (Chawathe et al., 1994; Hammer et al., 1997) and HERMES <ref> (Adali and Subrahmanian, 1994) </ref>, are not integration systems, but rather tools for designing integration systems. These tools automate the creation of agents, which will in turn integrate the information sources. 4.1 TSIMMIS The TSIMMIS architecture consists primarily of translators and mediators. <p> TSIMMIS mediators are relatively simple. They direct queries to appropriate sources, and may eventually eliminate duplicate information or convert time stamps to a common format, though these abilities do not appear to be currently implemented. All communication to or between mediators is in OEM. 4.2 HERMES HERMES <ref> (Adali and Subrahmanian, 1994) </ref> is another system development tool. Like TSIMMIS, it helps users develop translators and mediators, but it appears to be a more substantial design tool, especially for mediators. HERMES separates the integration process into two parts, domain and semantic integration.

Reference-contexts: SIMS agents communicate using two languages: KQML (Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language) (Finin et al., 1994) is the meta-language used to carry information about agent desires and intentions, while LOOM <ref> (Brill, 1991) </ref> semantic nets are used to represent the information "goods" passed between agents. Four steps comprise the SIMS algorithm. First, an agent selects appropriate sources for a query based on content and cost. Next, it creates a plan to retrieve and possibly process the data.

Reference-contexts: draft over twelve feet, and cost knowledge indicating that getting draft information is cheaper than range information, SQO converts the query to one requesting draft information that will return the same information as the original query as long as the cost and domain knowledge remain true. 4 4.5 MACRON MACRON <ref> (Decker et al., 1995) </ref>, an intelligent agent approach, is not designed as an automater of KS integration, nor as a design tool, but to answer specific user queries. Nevertheless, it faces many of the same issues as the other systems discussed here.

Reference-contexts: This also creates hierarchies which can form and reform dynamically. A further benefit of distributed agent systems is the ability to modify the number of agents, or the ratio of source agents to mediators. This allows the system to maintain an efficient balance when work loads change <ref> (Decker et al., 1997) </ref>. 4 Other work Much work has been done in the area of integrating heterogeneous knowledge bases. Two systems, TSIMMIS (Chawathe et al., 1994; Hammer et al., 1997) and HERMES (Adali and Subrahmanian, 1994), are not integration systems, but rather tools for designing integration systems.

Reference-contexts: Attempts are being made to reduce the negative impacts of query re-mappings. "Planning by rewriting" (Knoblock and Ambite, 1997) generates low-cost but possibly sub-optimal plans. Another effort, "recursive information gathering" <ref> (Duschka and Levy, 1997) </ref> generates a maximally contained set of query rewritings (the set contains information subsets of the query, not just equivalents). By exploiting functional dependencies in the domain model, queries can be translated in time polynomial in the number of query terms.

Reference-contexts: It is designed to meet the lexical information needs of the SPECIALIST Natural Language Processing System, and so includes syntactic, morphological, and graphemic information. 2 TraumAID, TraumaTIQ, and TraumaGEN TraumAID (Webber et al., 1992) is a decision support system for the initial management of multiple trauma. TraumaTIQ <ref> (Gertner and Webber, 1996) </ref>is a module that compares a physician's inferred management plan with TraumAID's plan, and creates critiquing information for each significant difference between them. The set of critique information is then processed by a text planner, TraumaGEN (Carberry and Harvey, 1997) that generates coherent, integrated messages.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, an integration system can derive new information by examining diverse sources or verifying the contents of one database against another. The need for this kind of information processing is demonstrated by the popularity of a simple implementation. BargainFinder <ref> (Krulwich, 1995) </ref> is a simple integration agent designed to operate on the Internet. As an Internet tool, it represents a substantial improvement over keyword search, since it can query databases instead of just searching web page text.

Reference-contexts: The Information Manifold uses extensive knowledge of its sources to ensure that only relevant sources are polled in its plan. It can also guarantee that a minimal number of sources were polled. Occam <ref> (Kwok and Weld, 1996) </ref> claims to be a sound, 5 complete, and efficient planner, provided that every piece of information knowable about each KS is carefully written into the meta-language.

Reference-contexts: It is the task of the translator to convert information between the input/output formats of a knowledge source and a standard representation. Given a source's query and output formats, TSIMMIS can generate such a translator. The common representation is OEM, or Object Exchange Model <ref> (Papakonstantinou et al., 1995) </ref>, which consists of self-describing objects that allow simple nesting. The OEM representation is then passed to the mediator. TSIMMIS mediators are relatively simple.

Reference-contexts: Cached data is stored in LOOM, and is indexed with a description of the information gleaned from the initial query. The second kind of learning is Semantic Query Optimization (SQO). When the system detects an expensive query it attempts to learn (using ID3 <ref> (Quinlan, 1986) </ref> ) information that will reduce the cost of similar future requests.
