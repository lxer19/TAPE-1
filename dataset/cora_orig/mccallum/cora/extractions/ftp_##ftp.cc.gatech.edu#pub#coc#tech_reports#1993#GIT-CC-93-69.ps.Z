Abstract: In [LBA93], a suite of randomized broadcast protocols was presented for the problem of broadcasting a message in arbitrary multi-hop radio networks. These protocols improved upon that of Bar-Yehuda et al. in most of the typical cases. Unfortunately, in those protocols it is assumed that only a single broadcast by a single node is in progress at any point in time. Hence, those protocols are of limited use in practice. In this paper, we present a suite of randomized multi-source broadcast protocols in multi-hop radio networks, in which more than one broadcast can be in progress at any point in time. The protocols are compared with each other in several typical cases.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, they examined the k-broadcast problem, in which k nodes initiate broadcasts and presented a randomized protocol for the problem. However, their protocol is too complicated to implement and also causes congestion at the root. Furthermore, k-broadcasts can be performed using the emulation procedure of Bar-Yehuda et al. <ref> [BGI91] </ref>. This procedure probabilistically emulates a single timeslot of a single-hop radio network with collision detection (CD) on an arbitrary multi-hop radio network without CD mechanism. There are several protocols for the so-called multiple access problem in single-hop broadcast networks [Cap79a, Cap79b, Gal78].

Reference-contexts: The overhead of the emulation is expensive and does not seem to be practical because the emulation uses a large number of applications of the randomized broadcast protocol of <ref> [BGI92] </ref>. The question is whether multiple broadcasts can be done without much complexity and much overhead. In [LBA93], a suite of randomized broadcast protocols was presented for the problem of broadcasting a message in arbitrary multi-hop radio networks.

Reference-contexts: Broadcast communication is an essential ingredient in many distributed network applications. Despite the broadcast nature of the radio medium, broadcast in multi-hop radio networks requires careful consideration due to the increased potential for collisions. The multiple broadcast problem in multi-hop radio networks was studied by Bar-Yehuda et al. <ref> [BII89] </ref>. Specifically, they examined the k-broadcast problem, in which k nodes initiate broadcasts and presented a randomized protocol for the problem. However, their protocol is too complicated to implement and also causes congestion at the root. Furthermore, k-broadcasts can be performed using the emulation procedure of Bar-Yehuda et al. [BGI91].

In addition to assumptions in Section 2, we assume that each node knows the ID's of its neighbors.
