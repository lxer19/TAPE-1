Title: A Cost Effective Implementation of Motion Capture  
Author: Travis Heppe 
Keyword: Existing motion capture systems generally use either high-speed digital cameras or custom-designed magnetic  
Note: pickups. Systems using these techniques can cost anywhere from $50,000 to $200,000 [Nes96], outpricing all but the most dedicated professionals.  
Address: Santa Cruz  
Affiliation: University of California,  
Abstract: All potential users of motion capture technology have thus far been forced to do one of two things: either foot the bill for a wildly expensive set of equipment, or pay a company multiple thousands of dollars per day for the use of an existing studio. With this paper, we explore the possibility of using standard video equipment to make the process 10 to 100 times cheaper, bringing the technology for the first time within the personal computer user's price range.

Reference-contexts: Debevec, Taylor and Malik <ref> [DTM96] </ref>, from UC Berkeley, used stereo vision to reconstruct architectural scenes. They used many of the same basic techniques as optical motion capture, and their bibliography provided references to many of the articles used in this paper.

Reference-contexts: They use an approximate model of the scene to help constrain stereo correspondence, then from just a few views of the scene, created a more exact computer model and the texture maps necessary to create novel views from arbitrary angles. Faugeras and Toscani <ref> [FT86] </ref> showed that unit vector corresponding to a point (u i ; v i ) in the image is an affine function of its coordinates, given their camera model.

Reference-contexts: The camera is held in front of an array of squares, the corners of which serve as calibration points. Kruppa showed in 1913 <ref> [Kru13] </ref> that through two views of five known world coordinates, camera position can be determined.

Reference-contexts: High performance motion capture has developed into a multi-million dollar industry, and several companies rent their studios to serve wealthy customers interested in slow-motion playback capabilities and high accuracy. In a recent IEEE conference in Belgium, J.C. Sabel <ref> [Sab96] </ref> also introduced a high-performance system intended for scientific use. For all the development efforts, Optical motion capture systems so far have all focused on high speed 1 digital video equipment, making them all extremely expensive. <p> Off-the-shelf video technology is too slow for martial arts, and both too slow and too inaccurate for the precision slow-motion analysis required by professional sports trainers. If the reader is looking for a high performance system, she is advised to look elsewhere (for example, the article by J.C. Sabel <ref> [Sab96] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Hopefully the direction of a marker from one camera's position (in particular, the camera whose view had recently been occluded) can be derived from two other cameras. 2.4 Camera calibration: Roger Tsai <ref> [Tsa87] </ref> and has developed a successful method for dealing with the problem of finding the radial distortion of a camera. The camera is held in front of an array of squares, the corners of which serve as calibration points.
