Reference-contexts: Further, if surface tension is included so that the problems are well-posed [3, 2], then the analysis of Krasny filtering presented here, combined with the analysis presented in <ref> [4] </ref> can be used to prove convergence in that case also. The outline of the paper is as follows. In section 2, the nonlinear filtering is introduced and a sequence of model equations is analyzed, providing an overall framework for our analysis. <p> Then, it is a straightforward computation to see that with ~z j = ff j + ~s j so extended, one gets h N=2 X l6=j 2 = M ! 1 2i l=N (M+1=2)+1 1 : (5.2) See <ref> [4] </ref> for details. Hereafter, we adopt the notation F [~s] j 2i l6=j ~z j ~z l lim h N (M+1=2) X l6=j ~z j ~z l 11 Some properties of F are given as follows. <p> It is not difficult to see that ^ F L = 2 jkj for N=2 + 1 k N=2 and periodically extended to all k. See <ref> [4] </ref> for example.

Reference-contexts: Typically, in an ill-posed problem, the linear growth rates increase unboundedly with increasing wavenumber. Such problems may have short time smooth solutions if the Fourier coefficients of the initial data have rapid enough decay (i.e. existence in analytic function spaces <ref> [5, 10, 21] </ref>). <p> This is a significant improvement over previous previous convergence theorems for this problem where the time of convergence was restricted to be much less than the singularity time [8, 12]. The near equilibrium case was studied on the continuous level in <ref> [5, 21] </ref>. If the near equilibrium condition is violated, convergence is obtained for a short time if the true solution remains smooth. The improved result rests on two observations. First, the nonlinear filter must be included in the analysis to control the growth of the round-off error in time. <p> Still, this is not enough to obtain a "long time" convergence theorem. Second, it also is necessary to separate the linear and nonlinear parts of the equation. Both parts of the equation must then be precisely estimated. This is analogous, in spirit, to the continuous analysis of <ref> [5] </ref> where the linear part of the equation is solved exactly (by integration along complex characteristics) and precise bounds were obtained for the nonlinear operator. <p> This is the norm in which convergence is proven. In the continuous case, Caflisch & Orellana <ref> [5] </ref> showed the following near equilibrium result.

Reference-contexts: This is a classical problem in fluid dynamics and the sheet undergoes the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. In this problem, the linear growth rate is proportional to the wavenumber. Moreover, singularity formation appears to be generic, even for vortex sheets initially near equilibrium <ref> [13, 6, 19] </ref>. One motivation for performing numerical simulations of the vortex sheet problem is to characterize the types of singularities that can form and to determine whether there is in fact a "generic" type. <p> For such data, linear theory predicts that a singularity will occur at time t fl = 2 fl : It was shown in <ref> [6] </ref> that for " small and for a restricted set of initial data, that the nonlinear and linear solutions are nearly identical up to, and including, the singularity time. Therefore, the time of existence T 0 is nearly optimal.

The improved result rests on two observations. <p> The fully discrete method is then given by ~z n+1fl 8 &gt; : 1 N=2 X l6=j 2 h + t e r &gt; = j We refer the reader to <ref> [13, 19, 8, 12] </ref> for additional details.

Of course, for fully discrete equations, existence of solutions is trivial, and the real point of the theorem is to obtain uniform bounds on the solution. A discrete version of the theorem was proved in <ref> [8] </ref>. In this section, two versions of the discrete Cauchy-Kowalewski theorem are given. The first is a discrete version of the strengthened formulation and simplified proof of the Cauchy-Kowalewski theorem by Safonov [18]. <p> Define D to be the discrete spectral derivative, i.e. ^ D = ik for N=2 + 1 k N=2 and periodically extended to all k.

Now, turn to Eq. (5.1). <p> The bound (5.20) will be used to control the effect of the filtering error in the full convergence proof. Now, turn to the question of the convergence of the numerical scheme. In <ref> [8] </ref>, it was shown that the continuous solution s n j = z (ff j ; nt) ff j satisfies the discrete equation s n+1 j + tF [s n ] fl 1 + hf n fl (5.23) where F is as in (5.3) and f n 1 , f n <p> f k r ~ I (k 1 ; : : : ; k m ; k) (10.3) where ~ I (k 1 ; : : : ; k m ; k) = 2i l6=0 ff l r=1 1 e ik r ff l ! 27 Using the analysis presented in <ref> [8] </ref>, it is straightforward to show that j ~ I (k 1 ; : : : ; k m ; k)j c m where c is independent of all k r and m.

Reference-contexts: This is a classical problem in fluid dynamics and the sheet undergoes the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. In this problem, the linear growth rate is proportional to the wavenumber. Moreover, singularity formation appears to be generic, even for vortex sheets initially near equilibrium <ref> [13, 6, 19] </ref>. One motivation for performing numerical simulations of the vortex sheet problem is to characterize the types of singularities that can form and to determine whether there is in fact a "generic" type. <p> If this region is fixed independently of the discretization parameters and of time, then this type of filtering scheme will clearly no longer converge at such times. On the other hand, a nonlinear filtering, introduced to this problem by Krasny <ref> [13] </ref>, has proven very successful. The filtering scheme of Krasny simply says that Fourier modes should be discarded if they lie below a certain error tolerance and kept if they lie above the tolerance. <p> Important consequences of this filter are that it allows nonlinearity to produce non-zero modes anywhere in the spectrum and that the linear growth rate is determined by the spatial discretization and not the filter. Using this nonlinear filter, Krasny <ref> [13] </ref> and subsequently Shelley [19] were able to accurately compute numerical solutions essentially up to the time they become singular. In this paper, a convergence analysis is presented for the point vortex method (applied to the vortex sheet problem) with nonlinear filtering and in the presence of simulated round-off error. <p> In Appendix 3, the proof of the discrete Cauchy-Kowalewski theorem in the absence of numerical filtering and roundoff error is presented. Finally, in Appendix 4, an estimate concerning the time difference of certain nonlinear terms is proved. 2 Nonlinear Filtering and Model Problems The nonlinear filter introduced by Krasny <ref> [13] </ref> can be considered as a projection operator in Fourier space. It is described as follows. <p> This is most effective for nonlinear problems, as the high wavenumbers grow due to nonlinear interactions as well as due to their own linear growth rate. Although it is difficult to explicitly write down a nonlinear example showing this, it is clearly seen in computations <ref> [13, 19] </ref>. In this section, we present a sequence of examples that show the essential effects of filtering, the necessity of using the abstract Cauchy- Kowalewski theorem and the overall strategy of our convergence proof. We begin with a linear example. <p> This is precisely the behavior that has been observed in numerical simulation of the vortex sheet problem with and without filtering <ref> [13, 19] </ref>. Now, consider the following nonlinear modification of Eq. (2.2). <p> The fully discrete method is then given by ~z n+1fl 8 &gt; : 1 N=2 X l6=j 2 h + t e r &gt; = j We refer the reader to <ref> [13, 19, 8, 12] </ref> for additional details. We now introduce some notation. For &gt; 0, define a norm as follows kf k = k=1 Assuming that kf k is finite is roughly equivalent to assuming that f (ff) is analytic in the strip jI m (ff)j &lt; .

Reference-contexts: Our analysis also applies to this case, however we omit it here for simplicity. The explicit inclusion of the vortex sheet strength only introduces minor modifications of the analysis presented here since the vortex sheet strength is time independent in the Lagrangian frame. See <ref> [14] </ref> for details. In Eq. (3.1), the integral is a Cauchy principal value integral, due to the singularity at ff 0 = ff, and * denotes complex conjugate. <p> Such problems include Rayleigh-Taylor unstable interfaces in inviscid, incompressible and irrotational fluids as well as Mullins-Sekerka unstable interfaces in a Hele-Shaw cell.

Reference-contexts: Typically, in an ill-posed problem, the linear growth rates increase unboundedly with increasing wavenumber. Such problems may have short time smooth solutions if the Fourier coefficients of the initial data have rapid enough decay (i.e. existence in analytic function spaces <ref> [5, 10, 21] </ref>). <p> This is a significant improvement over previous previous convergence theorems for this problem where the time of convergence was restricted to be much less than the singularity time [8, 12]. The near equilibrium case was studied on the continuous level in <ref> [5, 21] </ref>. If the near equilibrium condition is violated, convergence is obtained for a short time if the true solution remains smooth. The improved result rests on two observations. First, the nonlinear filter must be included in the analysis to control the growth of the round-off error in time.

Reference-contexts: Such problems include Rayleigh-Taylor unstable interfaces in inviscid, incompressible and irrotational fluids as well as Mullins-Sekerka unstable interfaces in a Hele-Shaw cell. See <ref> [14, 15, 9, 22, 23, 1] </ref> for example. The appropriate convergence proofs are then obtained by carefully analyzing the particular numerical method in question, obtaining an error equation and then applying the discrete Cauchy-Kowalewski theorems to these cases.
