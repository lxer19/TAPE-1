Abstract: Generating language that reflects the temporal organization of represented knowledge requires a language generation model that integrates contemporary theories of tense and aspect, temporal representations, and methods to plan text. This paper presents a model that produces complex sentences that reflect temporal relations present in underlying temporal concepts. The main result of this work is the successful application of constrained linguistic theories of tense and aspect to a generator which produces meaningful event combinations and selects appropriate connecting words that relate them.

Reference-contexts: Information about time is manipulated in the form of temporal intervals as defined by <ref> [ Allen, 1983; 1984 ] </ref> . These intervals are used to semantically analyze temporal connecting words and to augment the tense theory of [ Hornstein, 1990 ] so that it applies to events that have duration. <p> To extend this theory to events that have duration, we analyze events in terms of Allen's theory of temporal interval relationships <ref> [ Allen, 1983; 1984 ] </ref> . 8 Allen proposes that seven basic relationships and their inverses may exist between two intervals:before (&lt;), after (&gt;) during (d), contains (di), overlaps (o), overlapped by (oi), meets (m), met by (mi), starts (s), started by (si), finishes (f), finished by (fi), and equal (=). <p> We have provided a theory for selecting tenses for individual events that may be either points or intervals in time. The selection theory extends the theory of tense by [ Horn-stein, 1990 ] through a theory of temporal interval representation by <ref> [ Allen, 1983; 1984 ] </ref> . For literals that are to be combined in a matrix/adjunct structure, selected tenses are constrained by Hornstein's constraint on derived tense structure.

Reference-contexts: The current model implements an aspectual classification through the use of three features proposed by <ref> [ Bennett et al., 1990 ] </ref> following the framework of [ Moens and Steedman, 1988 ] : dynamic (i.e., events vs. states), telic (i.e., culminative events (transitions) vs. nonculminative events (activities)), and atomic (i.e., point events vs. extended events). Consider the two verbs ransack and obliterate. <p> semantically similar, the feature-based framework accounts for surface distinctions such as the following: (4) (i) John ransacked the house every day (ii) fl John obliterated the house every day 2.2 Temporal Knowledge Tense is taken to be the external time relationship between a given situation and others. (See, for example, <ref> [ Bennett et al., 1990 ] </ref> ). For example, each event in (2) has its own temporal structure.

Reference-contexts: This section describes the representations used for these two types of knowledge. 2.1 Aspectual Knowledge Following <ref> [ Dowty, 1979 ] </ref> and [ Vendler, 1967 ] , aspect is taken to have two components, one comprised of non-inherent features (e.g., those features that define the perspective such as simple, progressive, and perfective) and another comprised of inherent features (e.g., those features that distinguish between states and events). 4 <p> When both perfective and non-perfective are compatible with the CDTS both alternatives are produced. We address the choice of progressive vs. simple for the remainder of this section. Our method to select between progressive and simple relies on a set of restrictions based on work by <ref> [ Dowty, 1979 ] </ref> that we have adapted for generation of temporal information. <p> For literals that are to be combined in a matrix/adjunct structure, selected tenses are constrained by Hornstein's constraint on derived tense structure. Next, we have provided a theory for aspect selection that is constrained by the tenses already selected for an event; the aspectual constraints are adapted from <ref> [ Dowty, 1979 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: The connecting word selection is constrained by the aspectual values already selected for an event.

Reference-contexts: Information about time is manipulated in the form of temporal intervals as defined by [ Allen, 1983; 1984 ] . These intervals are used to semantically analyze temporal connecting words and to augment the tense theory of <ref> [ Hornstein, 1990 ] </ref> so that it applies to events that have duration. We focus on the mapping of the timestamped input into a matrix (i.e., main) clause and an adjunct (i.e., subordinate) clause conjoined by a connecting word. <p> As for relating these two events, the approach adopted here is based on a neo-Reichenbachian framework proposed by <ref> [ Hornstein, 1990 ] </ref> in which the BTSs are organized into a Complex Tense Structure (CTS) as follows: the first event (i.e., matrix clause) is written over the BTS of the second event (i.e., adjunct clause) and the 6 It is assumed that the reader is familiar with [ Reichen-bach, 1947 <p> In particular, it has been persuasively argued by <ref> [ Hornstein, 1990 ] </ref> that all sentences containing a matrix and adjunct clause are subject to a linguistic (syntactic) constraint on tense structure regardless of the lexical tokens included in the sentence. <p> Here, the association of R 2 and R 1 violates the CDTS, thus ruling out the sentence. 3 Handling Events with Duration Hornstein's theory of tense <ref> [ Hornstein, 1990 ] </ref> assumes that events are points in time.
