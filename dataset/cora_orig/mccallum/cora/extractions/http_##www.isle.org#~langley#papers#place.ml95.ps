Abstract: In this paper we define the task of place learning and describe one approach to this problem. The framework represents distinct places using evidence grids, a probabilistic description of occupancy. Place recognition relies on case-based classification, augmented by a registration process to correct for translations. The learning mechanism is also similar to that in case-based systems, involving the simple storage of inferred evidence grids. Experimental studies with both physical and simulated robots suggest that this approach improves place recognition with experience, that it can handle significant sensor noise, and that it scales well to increasing numbers of places. Previous researchers have studied evidence grids and place learning, but they have not combined these two powerful concepts, nor have they used the experimental methods of machine learning to evaluate their methods' abilities.

Reference-contexts: We felt this measure would be less sensitive to situations in which disagreements arise between cells having high certainty, and initial experiments <ref> (Langley & Pfleger, 1995) </ref> suggest that our version fares much better than the Moravec/Blackwell measure. The above metrics assume that the stored and temporary grids are described in the same coordinate system.
