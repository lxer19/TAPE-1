Title: Behavioral Representations for VCO and Detectors in Phase-Lock Systems  
Author: Edward Liu and Alberto L. Sangiovanni-Vincentelli 
Address: Berkeley, California 94720  
Affiliation: Department of Electrical Engineering Computer Sciences University of California  
Abstract: This paper presents behavioral representations for detectors and voltage-controlled oscillators that are independent of circuit architectures. Parameter extraction techniques are described. Finally, parameter extraction for a VCO is demonstrated, and an example PLL constructed using the models is simulated and verified against actual chip measurements.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Behavioral simulation is used in our constraint-driven, top-down hierarchical design methodology <ref> [1] </ref> to verify the design early. In digital domain, the behavior of a circuit is defined to be the function to be implemented independent of the architecture and/or schematics. Behavioral simulation in digital circuits can reduce substantially the design cycle.

Reference-contexts: In a practical VCO, the frequency is nonlinearly related to the input voltage, the output contains harmonic components (distortion), and the phase has random variations (phase noise). Previous work <ref> [5] </ref> [6] includes macromodels for SPICE which do not model distortion or noise effects. <p> In contrast, the SPICE v 0 1 2 n (gain,phase) (gain,phase) (gain,phase) 1 (2.88V, -3.72) (2.88V, -4.10) (2.88V, -4.47) 3 (78.2mV, -3.02) (78.0mV, -4.17) (78.2mV, -5.27) 5 (6.65mV, -1.37) (6.63mV, -3.29) (6.69mV, -5.12) macromodels in <ref> [5] </ref> do not model harmonics, so the lower error bound is given by the first order residual error shown in Figure 5.

Reference-contexts: nonlinear dynamic stage 2, the output y is given by y = n=1 h n (t 1 ; : : : ; t n )x (t t 1 ) : : : x (t t n )dt 1 : : : dt n where h n are the Volterra kernels <ref> [7] </ref> of stage 2. To solve (4), we make the quasi-static approximation. 2.1 Quasi-static approximation In a practical sinusoidal VCO, the phase noise is small, the control range is small, and the control voltage varies much slowlier than the frequency f .

Reference-contexts: The following steps are followed: (a) For a constant input v, estimate from output y the fundamental frequency, f , using the sinusoidal minimum error method <ref> [8] </ref> or the complex demodulation method [9]. In the latter case, the idea is to multiply y (t; v) with e j2 ^ ft , followed by low pass filtering to get z (t), where ^ f is our guess of f .

Reference-contexts: If ^ f = f , the phase of z (t) is constant; otherwise, it is slowly time-varying for ^ f f . Using Newton-Raphson <ref> [10] </ref>, solve for f such that the phase of z (t) is constant. (b) With f known, the magnitude and phase of the fundamental and harmonics can be similarly calculated using demodulation. <p> For example, in (8), we need to find the upper integration limit, y 1 (j), to satisfy the equation. As a result, we solve for y 1 (j) by using an iterative solver on top of an integration algorithm. For prototyping, we implemented the iterative false position method <ref> [10] </ref> on top of the trapezoidal integration algorithm to search for the points. Using this algorithm, the simulation speed is dramatically increased, while preserving numerical stability. A prototype simulator has been implemented using the C++ language on a DECstation 5000.

Reference-contexts: Another problem is that the phase characteristic depends on the shape of the waveforms, so the characteristic is not defined until input signals are applied. As a result, the phase characteristic is not appropriate as a behavioral representation. Detectors are classified into two broad categories <ref> [12] </ref>: multipliers (zero memory circuits) and sequential circuits (with memory). In this paper, sequential circuits are represented by state machines with analog inputs, a and b, analog outputs g (a; b), and clock triggered by zero crossings of a and b.
