Email: raftery@stat.washington.edu Abstract We combine image-processing techniques with a powerful new statistical technique to detect linear pattern production faults in woven textiles. Our approach detects a linear pattern in preprocessed images via model-based clustering. It employs an approximate Bayes factor which provides a criterion for assessing the evidence for the presence of a defect. The model used in experimentation is a (possibly highly elliptical) Gaussian cloud superimposed on Poisson clutter. Results are shown for some representative examples, and contrasted with a Hough transform. Software for the statistical modeling is available.

Reference-contexts: However, if there are several flaws, perhaps intersecting one another, a more explicit incorporation of linearity might be advantageous. We now indicate briefly how this can be done. In model-based clustering, the covariance matrix associated with a cluster is parametrized <ref> (Banfield and Raftery, 1993) </ref> as = DAD T where: is the largest eigenvalue of , D is the matrix of eigenvectors, and A = diagf1; ffg.

Reference-contexts: In this work, we are interested only in letting the data determine the best value for A which amounts to determining the best value for ff. Murtagh and Raftery <ref> (1984) </ref> assumed user-specification of ff. A maximum likelihood estimate of the clusters (using EM) may additionally be used automatically to determine an optimal value of ff in the following way. <p> This results in a likelihood equation which reduces to the following simple expression for the estimate of ff: ^ff = ! 2 =! 1 i.e. the ration of eigenvalues (Dasgupta and Raftery, 1995). This reinforces the approach of Murtagh and Raftery <ref> (1984) </ref> by casting this problem in a likelihood framework. 4 To summarize, we seek a highly elliptical Gaussian cluster superimposed on a homogeneous Poisson background.
