Title: Mobisaic: An Information System for a Mobile Wireless Computing Environment

Abstract: Mobisaic is a World Wide Web information system designed to serve users in a mobile wireless computing environment. Mobisaic extends the Web by allowing documents to both refer and react to potentially changing contextual information, such as current location in the wireless network. Mobisaic relies on client-side processing of HTML documents that support two new concepts: Dynamic Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and Active Documents. A dynamic URL is one whose results depend upon the state of the user's mobile context at the time it is resolved. An active document is one that automatically updates its contents in response to changes in a user's mobile context. This paper describes the design of Mobisaic, the mechanism it uses for representing a user's mobile context, and the extensions made to the syntax and function of Uniform Resource Locators and HyperText Markup Language documents to support mobility.

Reference-contexts: For those clients that only support an external interface or do not have an interface for adding asynchronous input descriptors, we have a wrapper program that handles dynamic environments and controls the Web client as a child process. Our prototype Mobisaic client is the X Mosaic client <ref> [Andreessen and Bina 94] </ref> extended with the Mobisaic client library.

Reference-contexts: A dynamic environment is maintained by a subscription-based server to which applications broadcast queries and from which applications receive multicast notifications. We use the zephyr notification system <ref> [DellaFera et al. 88] </ref> to implement the publish and subscribe facilities. Zephyr allows programs to subscribe to any number of message classes and class instances to which other programs can address and send messages.

Reference-contexts: new stock values are published in the dynamic environment variable for stocks. 6 Implementation This section discusses our implementation of Mo-bisaic and the changes we applied to a standard Web client to use them. 6.1 Dynamic environments Dynamic environments [Schilit et al. 93B] support a network-based publish and subscribe paradigm <ref> [Oki et al. 93] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It operates only within relatively small administrative domains, such as a department or campus. It cannot distribute information quickly to many hosts, which can become a problem in the current system during heavy load. (This bottleneck and a possible solution to it are discussed in <ref> [Schilit and Theimer 94] </ref>.) Fortunately, a C library interface hides the use of zephyr from Web clients, so changing to a new transport should be relatively easy. 6.2 Client modifications Any Web browser can be modified to support dynamic URLs and active documents provided that it supports an interface for loading

Reference-contexts: For example, a dynamic document might include a reference to the Location dynamic environment variable to customize its contents according to the user's current location. 1.1 Related work Researchers at Xerox PARC have broadly introduced the idea of context-aware applications <ref> [Schilit et al. 93A] </ref>. They initially proposed the notion of dynamic environments as a means of representing and disseminating information from users' mobile contexts throughout the system. Mobisaic is essentially an application of those ideas to WWW browsing.

Reference-contexts: The update is done by the client browser, which receives notifications when the dynamic information changes. Dynamic information in Mobisaic is represented using dynamic environments <ref> [Schilit et al. 93B] </ref>. Just as standard shells provide environment variables to customize applications started from the shell (e.g., DISPLAY), dynamic environments provide environment variables for customizing mobile applications. <p> describing or referencing a stock, the document will update itself as new stock values are published in the dynamic environment variable for stocks. 6 Implementation This section discusses our implementation of Mo-bisaic and the changes we applied to a standard Web client to use them. 6.1 Dynamic environments Dynamic environments <ref> [Schilit et al. 93B] </ref> support a network-based publish and subscribe paradigm [Oki et al. 93]. A dynamic environment is maintained by a subscription-based server to which applications broadcast queries and from which applications receive multicast notifications.

Reference-contexts: An infrared receiver attached to the serial line detects transmissions from infrared beacons placed in rooms and hallways for fine-grained location information. The second Mobisaic Web client will be the W* Web client running in the Wit <ref> [Watson 94] </ref> environment. 7 Summary This paper has described a World Wide Web information system called Mobisaic that investigates information browsing in a mobile wireless computing environment. Mobisaic introduces two mechanisms, dynamic URLs and active documents, for incorporating contextual information from a user's mobile computing environment into the Web.
