Reference-contexts: These theories all depend on extra-linguistic knowledge, the accumulation of which presents a problem in the realization of a practical analyzer. Cohen proposed a framework for analyzing the structure of argumentative discourse <ref> [Cohen 87] </ref>, yet did not provide a concrete identification procedure for `evidence' relationships between sentences, where no linguistic clues indicate the relationships. Also, since only relationships between successive sentences were considered, the scope which the relationships cover cannot be analyzed, even if explicit connectives are detected.

Reference-contexts: However, since conventional word-frequency-based abstract generation systems (e.g. [Kuhn 58]) are lacking in inter-sentential or discourse-structural analysis, they are liable to generate incoherent abstracts. On the other hand, conventional knowledge or script-based abstract generation systems (e.g. [Lehnert 80], <ref> [Fum 86] </ref>), owe their success to the limitation of the domain, and cannot be applied to document with varied subjects, such as popular scientific magazine. To realize a domain-independent abstract generation system, a computational theory for analyzing linguistic discourse structure and its practical procedure must be established. <p> Second, once the rhetorical structure is obtained, various lengths of generated abstracts can be generated easily. This can be done by simply repeating the reduction process until one gets the desired length of abstract. Third, unlike conventional knowledge or script-based abstract generation systems (e.g. [Lehnert 80], <ref> [Fum 86] </ref>), the rhetorical structure extraction does not need prepared knowledge or scripts related to the original text , and can be used for texts of any domain , so long as they contain enough rhetorical expressions to be expository writings.

Reference-contexts: Hobbs developed a theory in which he arranged three kinds of relationships between sentences from the text coherency viewpoint [Hobbs 79]. Grosz and Sidner proposed a theory which accounted for interactions between three notions on discourse: linguistic structure, intention, and attention <ref> [Grosz et al. 86] </ref>. Litman and Allen described a model in which a discourse structure of conversation was built by recognizing a participant's plans [Litman et al. 87]. These theories all depend on extra-linguistic knowledge, the accumulation of which presents a problem in the realization of a practical analyzer.

Reference-contexts: The system is now utilized as a text browser for a prototypical interactive document retrieval system. 2 INTRODUCTION Abstract generation is, like Machine Translation, one of the ultimate goal of Natural Language Processing. However, since conventional word-frequency-based abstract generation systems (e.g. <ref> [Kuhn 58] </ref>) are lacking in inter-sentential or discourse-structural analysis, they are liable to generate incoherent abstracts. <p> The rhetorical structure also provides the rhetorical relation between the extracted sentences, and can be used to generate appropriate connectives between them. Abstract generation based on rhetorical structure extraction has four merits. First, unlike conventional word-frequency-based abstract generation systems (e.g. <ref> [Kuhn 58] </ref>), the generated abstract is consistent with the original text in that the connec-tives between sentences in the abstract reflect their relation in the original text. Second, once the rhetorical structure is obtained, various lengths of generated abstracts can be generated easily.

Reference-contexts: Also, since only relationships between successive sentences were considered, the scope which the relationships cover cannot be analyzed, even if explicit connectives are detected. Mann and Thompson proposed a linguistic structure of text describing relationships between sentences and their relative importance <ref> [Mann et al. 87] </ref>. However, no method for extracting the relationships from superficial linguistic expressions was described in their paper. We have developed a computational model of discourse for Japanese expository writings, and implemented a practical procedure for extracting discourse structure [Sumita 92].

We have developed a computational model of discourse for Japanese expository writings, and implemented a practical procedure for extracting discourse structure <ref> [Sumita 92] </ref>. In our model, discourse structure is defined as the rhetorical structure, i.e., the compound of rhetorical relations between sentences in text. Abstract generation is realized as a suitable application of the extracted rhetorical structure. <p> The limitations of the system are mainly due to errors in the rhetorical structure analysis and the sentence-selection-type abstract generation. the evaluation of the accuracy of the rhetorical structure analysis carried out previously ( <ref> [Sumita 92] </ref> ) showed 74%. Also, to make the length of the abstract shorter, It is necessary to utilize an inner-sentence analysis and to realize a phrase-selection-type abstract generation based on it. The anaphora-resolution and the topic-supplementation must also be realized in the analysis.
