Abstract: Introduction In the previous article we looked at the essentials of the Java programming language; basic class concepts, compiling and running Java programs and downloading the materials from Sun. We also looked at some of the programming problems that Java was designed to overcome with internet programming such as security and program authorship protection. Lastly we presented some small programs to demonstrate some simple features of complete Java Programs. This month we will revisit some of these concepts and explore them in more detail. Specifically, we will look at objects and classes and the concept of scope and how it can be used to extend the usefulness of your programs. Lastly, the libraries of the Java language will be used to develop some applications To begin,Java is a pure object oriented programming language. What this means is that all programming is through objects. This change in programming paradigms is similar to that which must be adopted when programming with threads and multiprocessors. With threads you can no longer assume things happens sequentially. With object oriented programs you no longer manipulate variables you manipulate handles to objects. The gain from this new programming technique is a cleaner language and program. So, Java programing consists of the following:
