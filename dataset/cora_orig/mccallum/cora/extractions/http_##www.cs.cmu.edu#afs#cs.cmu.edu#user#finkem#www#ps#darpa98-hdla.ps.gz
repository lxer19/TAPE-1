Abstract: This paper describes first results of our DARPA-sponsored efforts toward recognizing and browsing foreign language, more specifically, Serbo-Croatian broadcast news. For Serbo-Croatian as well as many other than the most common well studied languages, the problems of broadcast quality recognition are complicated by 1.) the lack of available acoustic and language data, and 2.) the excessive vocabulary growth in heavily inflected languages that lead to unacceptable OOV-rates. We present a Serbo-Croatian large vocabulary system that achieves a 74% recognition rate, despite limited training data. Our system achieves this rate by a multipass strategy that dynamically adapts the recognition dictionary to the speech segment to be recognized by generating morphological variations (Hypothesis Driven Lexical Adaptation). We will outline the bootstrapping and training process of the Janus Recognition Toolkit (JanusRTk) based broadcast news recognition engine: data collection, segmentation and labeling of the data according to different acoustic conditions, dictionary design, language modeling and training. The Hypothesis Driven Lexical Adaptation (HDLA) approach has been tested both on Serbo-Croatian and German news data and has achieved considerable recognition improvements. OOV-rates were reduced by 35-45%; on the Serbo-Croatian broadcast news data from 8.7% to 4.8% thereby also decreasing word error rate from 29.5% to 26%.

Reference-contexts: JANUS SPEECH RECOGNITION ENGINE 3.1. Dictation System For building a Serbo-Croatian broadcast news recognizer the Janus Recognition Toolkit (JRTk) <ref> [1] </ref> was used. Phone set and a pronunciation dictionary were generated almost automatically, as Serbo Character Set Web Sites # Words Diacritics 7 5 M No Diacritics 13 6 M Total 20 11 M Table 4: Internet Text Databases. Croatian orthography closely matches its pronunciation.

Reference-contexts: Vocal tract length normalization and cepstral mean subtraction are used to extenuate speaker and channel differences. A first context-independent Serbo-Croatian dictation system was trained using the labels generated by a speaker-adapted German rec-ognizer (label boosting <ref> [2] </ref>). The Serbo-Croatian phones were initialized by their closest German equivalents. A backoff trigram language model built on the very few available training transcriptions was used. The labels rewritten by the first Serbo-Croatian trained recognizer turned out to be more accurate and were used to train a context-dependent dictation system.

Reference-contexts: The 3.9% improvement in OOV-rate was also reflected in a 3.5% improvement in word error rate yielding a performance of 26% WE. 7. MULTILINGUAL INFORMEDIA The automatically generated transcripts are inserted into the multilingual Informedia database (see figure 5). In collaboration with the Informedia group at CMU <ref> [3] </ref> we have now introduced the Serbo-Croatian recognizer into a multilingual information retrieval system. Together with the Serbo-Croatian broadcast video material, the transcripts and the recognizer allow for automatic content-addressable search and multimedia document retrieval across languages (see separate system demo).

Reference-contexts: The extension of the Informedia database to more than one language will not only add to the diversity of information retrieved by monolingual queries but will also offer the possibility to phrase queries in several languages. Thus, the development of our Serbo-Croatian recognizer <ref> [4] </ref> provides an instance of a potentially larger multilingual information resource. 8. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we described the development of a Serbo-Croatian broadcast news recognizer.
