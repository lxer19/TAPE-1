Abstract: Controlling the rate of bulk data multicast to a large number of receivers is difficult due to the heterogeneity among the end-systems' capabilities and their available network bandwidth. If the data transfer rate is too high, some receivers will lose data, and retrans-missions will be required. If the data transfer rate is too low, an inordinate amount of time will be required to transfer the data. In this paper, we examine an approach towards rate-controlled multicast of bulk data in which the sender uses multiple multicast groups to transmit data at different rates to different sub-groups of receivers. We present simple algorithms for determining the transmission rate associated with each multicast channel, based on static resource constraints, e.g., network bandwidth bottlenecks. Transmission rates are chosen so as to minimize the average time needed to transfer data to all receivers. Analysis and simulation are used to show that our policies for rate selection perform well for large and diverse receiver groups and make efficient use of network bandwidth. Moreover, we find that only a small number of multicast groups are needed to reap most of the possible performance benefits.

Reference-contexts: Hence we consider normalized receiver rates between 1 and 100. The length of the data stream is taken to be 9MB, which is 5000 seconds worth of data at 14:4Kbps. Receiver rates R i (i = 1; 2; ) have been chosen as integer values in <ref> [1; 100] </ref>, distributed according to the following distributions : 1: UNI : P (R i = k) = 0:01; k = 1; 2; : : : ; 100. 2: SKEW : P (R i = k) = 0:3=78; k = 1; : : : ; 29, = 0:4=11; k = 30;

Reference-contexts: Real-time applications such as video have received particular attention in the study of multi-cast rate control for wide-area networks ([2, 3, 4, 5, 6]). However, approaches for for non real-time, loss-sensitive applications remain largely unexplored. Multilevel coding has been proposed for accomo--dating heterogeneity among receivers of encoded video in <ref> [3, 4, 5] </ref>. Though our work has drawn inspiration from such approaches, we have addressed a very different application domain, hence the solutions formulated are also different.

Reference-contexts: Mechanisms for recovering from the residual loss can be easily accomodated into our multichannel rate control scheme using a combination of retransmission-based ARQ and FEC techniques.

Reference-contexts: Allowing a receiver to receive only a portion of the data that is sent on a channel can significantly reduce the efficiency of data transfer, by requiring the sender to retransmit the discarded portion a large number of times. A detailed discussion of this point is found in <ref> [11] </ref>. We now define the following performance measures. <p> Then, of all multirate transmission schemes that attain the ideal completion time for every receiver, A ideal minimizes the transmission volume. A proof of this property is provided in <ref> [11] </ref>. 4 Multirate Transmission with Lim ited Channels In the previous section, we have derived an ideal multirate transmission scheme by using as many channels as receivers. <p> channels, our goal is to choose channel rates r 1 ; r 2 ; r K so as to (C1) Minimize P N P k n s.t. 1 k 1 k N ; k=1 r k R n ; j = 1; : : : ; N: We show in <ref> [11] </ref> that for every optimal solution to C1, F k 2 fR 1 ; : : : ; R N g.
