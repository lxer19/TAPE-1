Abstract: Markets offer an efficient and decentralized method of coordinating the actions of autonomous, self-interested agents. However, they fail in the presence of incentive conflicts between individual goals and system-wide goals. The actions of one agent often affect other agents. The tragedy of the commons occurs when self-interested agents, acting without concern for other agents, have a negative effect on the overall efficiency of the outcome. The classic economic solution is to impose taxes that penalize such actions. However the center needs complete information on the preferences of all the agents in the system to impose the correct level of tax, and in general agents can gain by revealing incorrect information. We present a simple decentralized mechanism that produces an efficient outcome through payoffs between agents, and requires no information in the center. We show an application of the mechanism to a multi-commodity flow problem.

Reference-contexts: The Compensation Mechanism provides the desired level of transfers between agents to achieve efficient outcomes. Another mechanism that has been used in DAI is the Groves-Clarke mechanism <ref> (Clarke 1971) </ref> (Groves 1973). It is a one-shot mechanism for problems with externalities. Each agent reveals complete preferences over the space of joint plans in the world, and the center selects an efficient plan and makes transfers to agents to facilitate truth-revelation.

Reference-contexts: A classic example of an externality is the pollution from a factory; without social laws a factory owner could choose to pollute a river since the adverse effects of his actions will only be felt downstream. The tragedy of the commons <ref> (Hardin 1968) </ref> arises when the self-interested actions of all the agents can have a negatively affect the system-wide efficiency of an outcome. Consider the case of a congestible network, such as the Internet.

Reference-contexts: The payoff is assumed much larger than the associated costs so agents will always choose to satisfy its goals (if possible), and is all-or-nothing. The Extended Compensation Mechanism maximizes the total utility over all the agents. Consider the abstract transportation network shown in figure 1 <ref> (Harker 1988) </ref>. There are four locations, connected by arcs as shown. Agent 1 must ship 10 units of cargo from location A to D, and agent 2 must ship 10 units of cargo from location D to A.

Reference-contexts: Without a suitable mechanism, a system of SI agents would over-use the shared resource, the arc B ! C, and the allocation of transport resources would be inefficient. Another canonical example of a market failure is provided by Braess' Paradox <ref> (Hogg 1995) </ref>, in which adding a new route to a network actually increases the cost that agents must pay. Such inefficiencies occur because self-interested agents fail to consider the impact of their actions on the other agents in the system.

Reference-contexts: When that information is not publicly known it is important that incentives are provided for agents to reveal true information about their preferences. Unfortunately the perfect mechanism is not possible. The impossibility theorem of Hurwicz <ref> (Hurwicz 1972) </ref>, originally stated for a simple exchange economy, and extended to economies of agents with externalities (Ledyard & Roberts 1974) states: There is no mechanism for implementing Pareto efficient joint plans that is individual rational and incentive compatible. As mechanism designers we cannot expect a perfect solution.

Reference-contexts: It is refined incentive compatible because we reduce the number of equilibria that agents may play by placing an assumption of sequential rationality, and considering only the subgame-perfect equilibria <ref> (Moore & Repullo 1988) </ref>. This is a weak restriction, because rational agents are expected to operate under sequential rationality in a multistage game. The full information assumption is relaxed by extending the mechanism to an iterated game where preferences are private.

Reference-contexts: The addition of the negotiation over compensations enables the agents to reach a more efficient solution. Convergence is fast, and the equilibrium is stable. Dropping the myopia assumption gives a game much like the Prisoner's Dilemma <ref> (Rapoport et al. 1962) </ref>. In particular, it becomes a dominant strategy for an agent to defect from truth-telling in the Compensation Mechanism and over-state the effect of the other agent's actions on its utility.

Reference-contexts: In multiagent systems agents are assumed to be self-interested (SI) and follow strategies pursuant to individual goals. This paper addresses the problem of designing mechanisms for MAS that promote good coordination and desirable social behavior. Consider the problem of automated contracting within a virtual enterprise <ref> (Sandholm & Lesser 1995) </ref>. An agent that represents a particular contractor can provide false information and break contracts in order to improve its position. The problem arises because the correct incentives are not in place for the agent to act truthfully and cooperative.

Reference-contexts: There has been significant interest in applying economic models to Distributed AI (Well-man 1993; Miller & Drexler 1988). Distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) can be classified into two related areas: cooperative distributed problem solving and multiagent systems (MAS). Distributed problem solving is the study of distributed but centrally designed systems <ref> (Sycara et al. 1991) </ref>, where agents are cooperative and truth-revealing by design, and are generally assumed to follow strategies towards a common goal. In multiagent systems agents are assumed to be self-interested (SI) and follow strategies pursuant to individual goals.

Reference-contexts: One must necessarily relax one or more of the impossibility conditions. The main approach used is to weaken the incentive-compatibility condition. The Compensation Mechanism The Compensation Mechanism that we present below is a two-stage full-information game that implements Pareto efficient joint plans as the equilibrium under truth-revelation <ref> (Varian 1994) </ref>. It is refined incentive compatible because we reduce the number of equilibria that agents may play by placing an assumption of sequential rationality, and considering only the subgame-perfect equilibria (Moore & Repullo 1988).

Reference-contexts: The Compensation Mechanism allows for strategic agents and handles the presence of externalities. Another application has been to resource contention in a multi-threaded CPU system. Typically heuristic techniques have been used to adjust the income of agents within the economy to promote social-welfare optimizing outcomes <ref> (Waldspurger et al. 1992) </ref>. The Compensation Mechanism provides the desired level of transfers between agents to achieve efficient outcomes. Another mechanism that has been used in DAI is the Groves-Clarke mechanism (Clarke 1971) (Groves 1973). It is a one-shot mechanism for problems with externalities.

Reference-contexts: Comparison With Other Work Wellman has used market-oriented programming to solve various distributed problems <ref> (Wellman 1996) </ref>. He assumes that agents act as price-takers even in small MAS when a strategic agent would be expected to outperform such a na^ve strategy (Vidal & Durfee 1996; Wellman 1996).
