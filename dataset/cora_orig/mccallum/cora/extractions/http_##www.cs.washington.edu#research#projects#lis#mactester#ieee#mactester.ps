Abstract: Teaching students the complete process of circuit design, simulation, implementation, test and debug is a daunting task. Even though design description tools and circuit compilers have kept up with the increasing levels of integration found in current implementation media such as FPGAs and microcontrollers, it has become increasingly difficult for students to test and debug the complex hardware projects enabled by these modern tools and devices. In this paper we describe an inexpensive digital circuit testing environment that greatly simplifies the test and debug experience. This environment, consisting of the tester hardware and its corresponding software, enables students to experience the challenges of testing and debugging without the expense of costly commercial hardware testers or the drudgery of setting up ad hoc hardware test jigs. The MacTester has been in use in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington for the past three years in both undergraduate and graduate hardware design courses as well as independent study and research projects.

Reference-contexts: Graduate students in Computer Science and Engineering have employed the MacTester for testing a variety of custom chips. Undergraduate students have been using the tester in digital design courses at the University of Washington for the past three years <ref> [2] </ref>. In CSE 477 (Digital System Design), approximately 25 students use three systems. In CSE 467 (Advanced Digital Design, a new course) students make much greater use of FPGAs, and consequently we needed to increase the ratio of MacTesters per student to 1:4 instead of 1:8.

Reference-contexts: We have gained experience with the tester at all levels of proficiency as described in the following summaries. A. Introductory digital logic design A typical laboratory exercise is to design a simple controller circuit, such as a dynamic RAM refresh controller or a traffic light controller <ref> [6] </ref>. The student describes the circuit using a state machine language. Students can verify their designs by several different means. One method is to compile the high level description into a form that can be simulated by a software logic simulator.

Reference-contexts: Here are detailed descriptions of the four examples. All except for SCL were developed as term projects in CSE 568, a graduate-level course for VLSI ASIC design. Apex <ref> [7] </ref> is a highly pipelined architecture for rapid generation of 3-D curved surfaces. An Apex chip takes four 3-D points as input and generates a spline curve as output at a rate of 5 million points per second, equivalent to 50K points per frame of NTSC video (1/30 s).

Reference-contexts: Working Apex chips were integrated into a Macintosh NuBus card to generate 3-D surfaces on a Tektronix stereo display monitor. Triptych <ref> [8] </ref> is a new FPGA architecture created at the University of Washington. Triptych is similar to the Xil-inx FPGA but yields higher circuit density than Xilinx by integrating routing and logic resources.

Reference-contexts: By using the programming interface, as well as some simple character graphics, a highly customized test environment was developed. We tested a number of Triptych prototype chips for complete functionality. SCL <ref> [9] </ref> is a systolic cellular logic chip for performing rapid computations on two-dimensional image data. Internally, the SCL is a SIMD architecture with 64 one-bit processing elements (PEs). Input and output of the SCL consist of a 64 x 64 array of pixels, each physical PE representing 64 logical PEs. <p> The host parallel interface card for the MacTester has been used to interface several printed circuit board projects with a Macintosh. Projects include SCAM, for evaluating and programming the SCL chip described in Section C <ref> [9] </ref>, and SPAM, for evaluating and programming the Caltech Asynchronous Microprocessor [12]. The students who developed programs for both SCAM and SPAM took advantage of the C programming environment that was developed for the tester. VI.

Reference-contexts: Partially processed images are displayed on the Macintosh screen in graphical form to let the user examine the image at each step in processing. We verified the functionality of the architecture and then determined the subset of chips that were defect-free. The Chaos Router <ref> [10] </ref> is a packet routing chip for constructing multicomputer interconnection networks in a 2-D mesh or torus topology. There are five 16-bit bidirectional routing channels per chip: north, south, east, west and the processor channel. Packets consisting of twenty 16-bit words can be injected into and ejected from any channel.

Reference-contexts: Nearly all the differences are isolated to the pin mapping phase. E. Miscellaneous uses for the MacTester A number of graduate student projects at the University of Washington made use of MacTester technology. One PhD project was to design, simulate, construct and program a 16-processor multicomputer called Meerkat <ref> [11] </ref>. A large subcomponent of the design was too large and complicated to simulate in LogicWorks because it did not fit in available memory. The solution was to relocate part of the simulated circuit into an FPGA placed in the MacTester.

Related work The MacTester bears many similarities with programmable testbeds such as the Universal Logic Implementer <ref> [13] </ref>, and the Virtual Hardware Schematic system from Aldec Inc. The ULI requires the user to configure a set of wires via a patch panel (plugboard). The ULI system includes personality cards for various TTL chips. There is also an RS-232 interface to a host computer.
