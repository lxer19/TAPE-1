Abstract: The synchronization problem for complex discrete-time systems is revisited from a control perspective and it is argued that the problem may be viewed as an observer problem. It is shown that for several classes of systems a solution for the synchronization (observer) problem exists. Also, by allowing past measurements a dynamic mechanism for state reconstruction is provided.

Reference-contexts: [18], often a receiver-transmitter (or master-slave) formalism is taken, where typically the receiver system is an exact copy of the transmitter system, and the aim is to synchronize the receiver response with that of the transmitter, provided the receiver dynamics are driven by a scalar signal from the transmitter, see <ref> [18, 4, 26] </ref>. More recently, the above method was recast in an active-passive decomposition, see [17], where the decomposition idea has to be understood in the way that part of the transmitter state needs to be transmitted, while the "passive" part then will be derived asymptotically.

OBSERVERS AND SYNCHRONIZATION 1.1 Introduction Since the work of Pecora and Carroll <ref> [18] </ref>, a huge interest in (chaos) synchronization has arisen. Among others, this is illustrated by the appearance of a number of special issues of journals devoted to the subject, cf. [29, 28, 30]. <p> Although by now this claim is not fully justified yet, several interesting applications of (chaos) synchronization are envisioned. Synchronization as it was introduced by Pecora and Carroll has been studied from various viewpoints. Following <ref> [18] </ref>, often a receiver-transmitter (or master-slave) formalism is taken, where typically the receiver system is an exact copy of the transmitter system, and the aim is to synchronize the receiver response with that of the transmitter, provided the receiver dynamics are driven by a scalar signal from the transmitter, see [18, <p> [18], often a receiver-transmitter (or master-slave) formalism is taken, where typically the receiver system is an exact copy of the transmitter system, and the aim is to synchronize the receiver response with that of the transmitter, provided the receiver dynamics are driven by a scalar signal from the transmitter, see <ref> [18, 4, 26] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Basically, only the observer design problem for linear systems has been solved in its full generality, cf. <ref> [20] </ref>. Therefore, we start our survey of possible approaches to observer-based synchronization by considering a class of nonlinear systems that is slightly more general than linear systems, namely systems in so called Lur'e form. <p> THEOREM 1.1 Assume that the pair (C; A) is observable. Then the system (1.3.4) admits an observer (1.3.5) with the exponentially stable linear error dynamics (1.3.6). The proof of this result can be found in any textbook on linear control theory (see e.g. <ref> [20] </ref>). It is worth mentioning that the proof is constructive. <p> This situation occurs when the so-called unobservable dynamics are exponentially stable. In the control literature linear systems with exponentially stable unobservable dynamics are referred to as detectable (cf. <ref> [20] </ref>). In practice it often means that such systems can be transformed to an observable system via model reduction.
