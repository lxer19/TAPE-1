Reference-contexts: Except for the endpoints, no values of the probability interval seem to have general significance outside of some particular context. Even if there exist some qualitatively meaningful reference probabilities, it is not clear that typical operations will respect the qualitative boundaries. For example, Bacchus <ref> (Bacchus 1989) </ref> has investigated an inheritance scheme based on properties holding with probability 1 2, finding that it did not sup port chaining of in ferences about typicality.

Reference-contexts: QPNs are trivially more expressive than de pendence graphs, as any dependence graph can be represented by a QPN where all links are of sign ?. There are also sound inference algorithms, based on graph transforma tions (Wellman 1990) or qualitative sign propagation <ref> (Druzdzel and Henrion 1993) </ref>. Both are efficient, and the latter is conjectured to be complete, at least with respect to queries about the qualitative influence relations among pairs of nodes.

Reference-contexts: Conditional vs. Unconditional Another significant distinction among ordinal approaches is whether the objects of comparison are event probabilities or conditional event probabilities. The use of conditionals is possible whether the comparison is relative or absolute. For exam ple, the scheme of <ref> (Dubois et al. 1992) </ref> is based on classifying within parametric interval ranges con ditional expressions corresponding to terms in a syllogism. Order-of-magnitude schemes (e.g., e-semantics (Pearl 1988) or System-Z + (Goldszmidt and Pearl 1992)) rank conditional probabilities corre sponding to de - fault rules against an infinitesimal scale.

Reference-contexts: When comparing conditional expressions in a relative scheme, it also makes sense to distinguish whether the comparison varies the base proposi tion, the conditioning events in the expression, or both. For example, the logic of <ref> (Grdenfors 1975) </ref> seems to allow arbitrary com - parisons, whereas Neufelds qualitative account of defaults (Neufeld 1989) makes use only of comparisons where the conditioning event is negated from one term to the other. 6.

Reference-contexts: From these explicit I relations, all that follow can be determined via d-separation, a sound, complete, and efficiently testable graphical connectivity criterion for conditional inde pendence <ref> (Geiger et al. 1990) </ref> . How can we view dependence graphs as a quali tative probability logic? Although the language is not sentential in form, we can cast it sententially in several ways. First, we can treat the whole graph as a sentence, asserting the conditional independence statements above.

Reference-contexts: a modular semantics, that is, one where we can give a meaning to each sentence separately, it appears that we need to treat the entire graph as one sentence, or accept sentences with nonlocal scope. (Alternately, we could give up modularity and de scribe dependence graphs in a nonmonotonic logic <ref> (Grosof 1988) </ref>.) The resulting logic is well characterized, and has a sound, complete, and efficient inference procedure based on d-separation (i.e., we can compute efficiently whether the indepen dence conditions expressed in one graph are en tailed by those of another).

Reference-contexts: Although a strict Bayesian would deny that it is ever rational to accept un certain propositions, 2 some have advocated it on the grounds that it simplifies reasoning. Indeed, this is one of the central motivations for nonmonotonic logics. See Kyburg and respondents <ref> (Kyburg 1994) </ref> for a discussion of acceptance based on proba bilistic thresholds. In any case, once an acceptance crite - rion is stated, the problem becomes a well-posed exercise in qualitative probability. <p> These points may correspond to intuitive landmarks on the probability interval, but in reality it will be only by coincidence that they line up with significant thresholds in any decision or accep tance problem. <ref> (Kyburg 1994) </ref> pro poses that in limited domains only a few threshold ac ceptance values will be required, but this claim is not really supported.

Dependence Graphs Probabilistic independence, conditional or un - conditional, is a basic qualitative con cept exploited implicitly or explicitly in many probabilistic rea soning schemes.

Thus, dependence graphs are not closed under marginalization. 7. Qualitative Probabilistic Networks Qualitative probabilistic networks (QPNs) are dependence graphs augmented with a specific form of ordinal, conditional comparison where the conditioning events vary ceteris paribus.

Reference-contexts: This would strictly increase the expressive power of the language, though I am not sure if it would permit expression of arbi - trary patterns of conditional independence. Marginalization of a dependence graph can be ac complished via the graphical operations of node reduction and arc reversal <ref> (Shachter 1988) </ref>. Although this preserves as many indepen dencies as possible, the result may still lose information about conditional independence among the original variables.

Reference-contexts: That is, qualitative prob - abilistic reasoning schemes are often judged by whether they sanction particular inference schemas or how well they match the expected results on canonical examples. Examples include probabilistic theories of causality <ref> (Suppes 1970) </ref> , and accounts of the phenomenon of explaining away in evidential reasoning (Pearl 1988; Wellman and Henrion 1993) . 4. A Taxonomy of Qualitative Probability Having described the general idea and formal framework, we are ready to classify some differ - ent forms of qualitative probability.

Reference-contexts: As a general methodology for representation and computation, qualitative reasoning has been investigated most explicitly and thoroughly within the field of Artificial Intelligence, especially by researchers inter ested in capturing commonsense or expert knowledge about the physical world <ref> (Weld and de Kleer 1989) </ref>. These researchers have tended to focus on particular sorts of qualitative properties: signs of physical quanti ties and rates of change, monotone relations among parameters, and topological descriptions of space.

Reference-contexts: The imprecision of qualitative probability means that we cannot in general determine a unique op timal deci sion, but the con straints may allow us to eliminate many of the possibilities based on qualitative dominance <ref> (Wellman 1990) </ref>. The aim of the acceptance task is to establish that the likelihood of particular propositions is sufficiently high that they should be ac cepted as beliefs. To accept a proposition is essentially to act as though it were certainly the case. <p> Finally, in compar ing conditional expressions, we can vary the base event part of the expression, or the conditioning events (or both). The qualitative probability lan guage I have developed, QPNs <ref> (Wellman 1990) </ref> , consists of relative ordinal comparisons among conditional expressions varying only the conditions, embedded within a dependence graph formalism. 5. Ordinal Qualitative Probability Several forms of qualitative probability are defined by introducing an ordering re lation / p over events signifying not less likely. <p> QPNs are trivially more expressive than de pendence graphs, as any dependence graph can be represented by a QPN where all links are of sign ?. There are also sound inference algorithms, based on graph transforma tions <ref> (Wellman 1990) </ref> or qualitative sign propagation (Druzdzel and Henrion 1993). Both are efficient, and the latter is conjectured to be complete, at least with respect to queries about the qualitative influence relations among pairs of nodes.

Reference-contexts: For example, Bacchus (Bacchus 1989) has investigated an inheritance scheme based on properties holding with probability 1 2, finding that it did not sup port chaining of in ferences about typicality. Analysis of the idea of using fixed totally-ordered (though not cardi nally scaled) reference events <ref> (Xiang et al. 1990) </ref> suggests that the problem is quite general, although Dubois et al. (1992) have found that a scheme with parametric thresholds can be surprisingly robust. An alternate approach is to invoke the ordering re lation among the domain events rather than special reference events.
