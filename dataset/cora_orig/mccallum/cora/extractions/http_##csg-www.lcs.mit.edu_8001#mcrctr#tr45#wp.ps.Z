Reference-contexts: In order to have any degree of portability, such a system must be written using a library that abstracts away the details of the parallel I/O channels without removing the parallelism in those channels. See <ref> [1, 2] </ref> for a first-cut at a parallel I/O system's structure.

Reference-contexts: Finally, for nondeterministic applications, a debugger that can allow replay of a single execution or trace of a program is highly desirable. Otherwise, it becomes difficult or impossible to reproduce the conditions that excited a bug, and therefore difficult to fix the bug. Robert Netzer's <ref> [4] </ref> work is along these lines. 12.5.2 Performance Tools Performance tools must present information about the performance of a program: how fast it executes, how many resources it consumes, and where the time is spent in the application: broken down by procedures, system calls, I/O, paging activity, and caching activity.

Reference-contexts: It runs software which implements cross-site shared memory in conjunction with the AC and ACD. It is a dedicated CPU for high-speed networking, and has a closely integrated network interface. 1 The nP is ABI compliant with the dP, with the addition of network access. 1 <ref> [5] </ref> shows that networking protocols can require as much CPU support as the applications driving them. Hence, we suggest adding a dedicated networking processor. 10 ACD The Address Capture Device. With the AC, translates CPU generated bus operations into inter-site messages to implement cross-site shared memory.
