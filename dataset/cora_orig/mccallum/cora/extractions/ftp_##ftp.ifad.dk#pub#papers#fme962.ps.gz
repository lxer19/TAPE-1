Abstract: System Component: Final Results in a Abstract. This paper presents the findings from the later phases of a study of the effects of introducing formal specification to the commercial-scale development of a small security-critical system component. The objectives and form of the study are briefly reviewed. Observations have been made of the effort profile across the project, compliance of the developed system with customer requirements and software characteristics. The results of these observations are presented. Conclusions and areas of further work are discussed.

Reference-contexts: It was noted that during the formal design of the trusted gateway considerably more time was spend in elucidating the data types which the system used and writing them down unambiguously (see <ref> [FBGL94] </ref>), possibly as a consequence of the use of a model-oriented specification language. The resulting formal definition can be included in the data dictionary entries used in the CASE tools.

Reference-contexts: It is important that the introduction of formal design into the development process be supported by computer based tool. Tool support was regarded as a practical necessity for the formal path to be followed at all. For a perspective on the practical use of the Toolbox, see <ref> [Muk95] </ref>. The use of animation allowed the system design to be examined early in the development process and let the engineers consider if the specified behaviour met expectations. The test cases used at this stage were carried forward through the programme and were eventually applied to the final system.
