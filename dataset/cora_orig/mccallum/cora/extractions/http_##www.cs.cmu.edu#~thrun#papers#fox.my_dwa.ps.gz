Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid approach to the problem of collision avoidance for indoor mobile robots. The DWA (short for: model-based dynamic window approach) integrates sensor data from various sensors with information extracted from a map of the environment, to generate collision-free motion. A novel integration rule ensures that with high likelihood, the robot avoids collisions with obstacles not detectable with its sensors, even if it is uncertain about its position. The approach was recently implemented and tested extensively as part of an installation, in which a mobile robot gave interactive tours to visitors of the Deutsches Museum Bonn. Here our approach was essential for the success of the entire mission, because a large number of ill-shaped obstacles prohibited the use of purely sensor-based methods for collision avoidance. Unfortunately, the sensor-based paradigm has important limitations. If the environment is complex, it might be difficult to equip a robot with a sensor suite capable of detecting arbitrary obstacles. For example, if the environment possesses large obstacles made of glass (such as in our testing environment, see below), light-based sensors will not be able to detect them and even sound-based sensors such as sonars usually have severe problems due to specular reflections, which often occur at smooth surfaces such as glass. The severity of the problem increases with the speed of the robot, as obstacles have to be detected early enough to allow the robot to decelerate safely. In a recent attempt to move away from office-type environments into more difficult ones, we found the problem of undetectable obstacles to be a major obstacle in the way of successful mobile robot navigation. In particular, we recently installed our mobile robot RHINO [4, 20] in the Deutsches Museum Bonn (German Museum Bonn), where it served the function of an interactive robotic tour-guide. The robot's task was to engage visitors and guide them through the exhibition, providing verbal explanations for the various exhibits. What made this task specifically challenging was the nature of the environment. While RHINO is equipped with five different sensor systems (see Figure 1), various obstacles were virtually undetectable for the robot, such as: glass cages, put up to protect exhibits (the label o1 marks such a barely visible cage in Figure 1), metal bars at various heights (see label o2 in Figure 1), small socles or metal plates on which exhibits were placed (e.g., o3 in Figure 5), just to name some. For the museum tour-guide application to be successful, the robot had to move at walking speed and avoiding collisions was of uttermost importance due to the nature of the obstacles in a museum. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to collision avoidance, called DWA (short for model-based dynamic window approach), which integrates our strictly sensor-based dynamic window approach [8] with a map of the environment. The location of the map (and hence the obstacles) relative to the robot is estimated using a metric version of the recently proposed Markov-localization algorithm, a gen
