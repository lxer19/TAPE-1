Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as work in progress. Abstract A number of other protocols may make use of HTTP syntax and facilities; this memo defines a mechanism for IANA to allocate status codes.

Reference-contexts: 1 Status Codes HTTP status codes are defined in RFC 2068 <ref> [1] </ref>, Section 10. Other protocols that share HTTP syntax and standard status codes may need to add additional status codes. In addition, implementors may want to define new status codes for HTTP in an interoperable manner.
