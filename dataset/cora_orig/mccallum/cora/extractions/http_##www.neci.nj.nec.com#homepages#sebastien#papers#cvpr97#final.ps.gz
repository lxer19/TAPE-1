Abstract: We propose a new rectification method for aligning epipo-lar lines of a pair of stereo images taken under any camera geometry. It effectively remaps both images onto the surface of a cylinder instead of a plane, which is used in common rectification methods. For a large set of camera motions, remapping to a plane has the drawback of creating rectified images that are potentially infinitely large and presents a loss of pixel information along epipolar lines. In contrast, cylindrical rectification guarantees that the rectified images are bounded for all possible camera motions and minimizes the loss of pixel information along epipolar line. The processes (eg. stereo matching, etc..) subsequently applied to the rectified images are thus more accurate and general since they can accommodate any camera geometry.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 1 depicts the rectification process. A scene S is observed by two cameras to create images I 1 and I 2 . In order to align the epipolar lines of this stereo pair, some image transformation must be applied. The most common of such transformations, proposed by Ayache <ref> [1] </ref> and referred to as planar rectification, is a remapping of the original images onto a single plane that is parallel to the line joining the two cameras optical centers (see Fig. 1, images P 1 and P 2 ). <p> Many variants of the planar rectification scheme have been proposed <ref> [1, 3, 4] </ref>. A detailed description based on the essential matrix is given in [5]. In [6], a hardware implementation is proposed. In [7], the camera motion is restricted to a vergent stereo geometry to simplify computations. <p> Examples of rectification for different camera geometries are presented in Sec. 4. 2 Linear transformation in projective space In this section we show how rectification methods based on a single linear transformation in projective space <ref> [1, 3, 4] </ref> fail for some camera geometries. As stated earlier, the goal of rectification is to apply a transformation to an image in order to make the epipolar lines parallel to the focus of expansion. <p> In Fig. 4, three different rectified image width (365, 730, 1095 pixels) were used with both methods, for a range of camera translations T = (1; 0; z) with a z component in the range z 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Cylindrical rectification shows no loss for any camera motion and any rectified image width 2 . However, planar rectification induces a pixel loss that depends on the camera geometry.

Reference-contexts: Although it is assumed throughout this paper that internal camera parameters are known, cylindrical rectification works as well with unknown internal parameters, as it is the case when only the Fundamental matrix (described in <ref> [2] </ref>) is available (See Sec. 3.5). Many variants of the planar rectification scheme have been proposed [1, 3, 4]. A detailed description based on the essential matrix is given in [5]. In [6], a hardware implementation is proposed.

Reference-contexts: In [7], the camera motion is restricted to a vergent stereo geometry to simplify computations. It also presents a faster way to compute the transformation by approximating it with a non-projective linear transformation. This eliminates the risk of unbounded images at the expense of potentially severe distortion. In <ref> [8] </ref>, a measure of image distortion is introduced to evaluate the performance of the rectification method. This strictly geometric measure, based on edge orientations, does not address the problem of pixel information loss induced by interpolation (see Sec. 3.6). Sec. 2 describes planar rectification in more details.
