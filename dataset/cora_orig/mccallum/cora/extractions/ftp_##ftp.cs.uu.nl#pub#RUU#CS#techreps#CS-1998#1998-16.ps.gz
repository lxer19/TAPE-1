Title: Separating an Object from its Cast  
Author: Hee-Kap Ahn Mark de Berg Prosenjit Bose Siu-Wing Cheng Dan Halperin Jir Matousek Otfried Schwarzkopf 
Abstract: In casting, liquid is poured into a cast that has a cavity with the shape of the object to be manufactured. The liquid then hardens, after which the cast is removed. We consider the case where the cast consists of two parts and address the following problems: (1) Given a cast for an object and a direction ~ d, can the cast be partitioned into two parts such that the parts can be removed in directions ~ d and ~ d, respectively, without colliding with the object or the other cast part? (2) How can one find a direction ~ d such that the above cast partitioning can be done? We give necessary and sufficient conditions for both problems, as well as algorithms to decide them for polyhedral objects. We also give some evidence that the case where the cast parts need not be removed in opposite directions is considerably harder.

Reference-contexts: To compute a description of this R collinear edges are not merged cut along a diagonal makes the area outside P a simple polygon polygon (in the form of a doubly-connected edge list <ref> [2] </ref>, for instance), we need to determine the union of the projection of the up-facets. This can be done in O (n log n) time with a plane sweep algorithm (see Preparata and Shamos [22] for details on plane sweep). <p> Consider first a degeneracy of type (i), where a set Q v of more than two arcs meet at a single vertex v. How to carry out the sweep line efficiently in this case is described in detail in <ref> [2, Chapter 2] </ref>. It remains to handle the counters update at v.

Reference-contexts: Hui [14] gave exponential time algorithms that also take cores and inserts into account. Since these algorithms are based on the work of Chen et al. they are not complete.

Reference-contexts: He reduced the problem to the hidden surface removal problem in computer graphics by observing that if all the facets can be completely illuminated from the parting direction and its opposite, then the parting direction is feasible. 2 The algorithm of Chen et al. <ref> [8] </ref> first computes the convex hull of a polyhedral object, and then obtains the pockets of the object by subtracting it from its convex hull. Chen et al. observed that if all pockets are completely visible in either the parting direction or its opposite, then the parting direction is feasible.

Reference-contexts: Their algorithm returns the parting direction that maximizes the number of completely visible pockets. However, as the converse of the above observation is not necessarily true, the algorithm is not complete and may not find a good parting direction even though one exists. Hui <ref> [14] </ref> gave exponential time algorithms that also take cores and inserts into account. Since these algorithms are based on the work of Chen et al. they are not complete.

Reference-contexts: They presented an O (n) time algorithm to determine whether a simple n-vertex polygon can be decomposed into two monotone chains, which is a sufficient and necessary condition for the polygon to be castable.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, it would be useful to study the extra possibilities that cores and inserts give. Finally, it is desirable to maximize the "flatness" of the parting surface between the two cast parts. Majhi et al. <ref> [17] </ref> considered this problem for convex polyhedral objects. They proposed a "flatness" measure and gave an O (n 2 ) time algorithm to find a cast that optimizes this measure, where n is the number of vertices.

Reference-contexts: Our assumptions imply that P may contain tunnels, but no voids|a polyhedron with a void is not castable anyway. For a more thorough description of polyhedra and some of their properties, the reader is referred to the book by Preparata and Shamos <ref> [22] </ref>. The characterization of castability that we give in the next section applies to both polyhedra and curved objects. This is important since many industrial parts are not polyhedral. <p> This can be done in O (n log n) time with a plane sweep algorithm (see Preparata and Shamos <ref> [22] </ref> for details on plane sweep). Every point on @P is the projection of a point on @P and, in fact, every vertex of P is the projection of a vertex of P.
