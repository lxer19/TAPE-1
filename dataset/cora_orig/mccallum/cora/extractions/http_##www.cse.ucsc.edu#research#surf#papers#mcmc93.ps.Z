Abstract: The performance advantages of MCM packaging are well known and have received much attention. It is becoming increasingly clear however that if MCMs are to succeed, they will have to be attractive in terms of cost as well as performance for consumer oriented designs. The SURF rubber-band router is designed to meet many of the needs of thin-film MCM layout that are not met by existing PCB tools. This paper describes a few of the ways that SURF can exploit the flexibility of the rubber-band wiring model to generate layouts that help reduce substrate cost. Specifically, approaches for reducing the number of metal layers and increasing substrate yield are presented. The results of applying these techniques to several MCM designs are shown. Finally, some future directions for research are described.

Reference-contexts: Two basic steps are used to produce evenly distributed wiring: (1) identifying unused areas of the layout, and (2) taking advantage of them by spreading nearby wiring into them. The spoke design rule checking strategy is based on cut flow and capacity analysis <ref> [1] </ref>. A cut is an imaginary line segment between two features in the layout. The number of wires crossing a cut is called its flow. The capacity of a cut is the maximum number of wires that can cross it without creating a design rule violation.

Reference-contexts: On a thin-film substrate, interconnect lines are lossy. By using line resistance to obtain stable signal propagation, it is possible to create self-damped lossy transmission lines <ref> [9, 3] </ref>. Because such lines are untermi-nated, they do not draw quiescent current while at non-zero voltages. A given set of process parameters determines the length of the longest self-damped line that can be created.

Reference-contexts: First, it is a true all-angle router|it has no directional bias. This allows it to efficiently use the resources of a single routing layer. Another advantage is the unconstrained layer assignment technique at the heart of SURF's detail router <ref> [8] </ref>. The layer assignment module takes a set of unrouted nets and through the addition of vias and branch points, partitions the nets into a set of point-to-point connections on specific layers. It uses an iterative optimization algorithm to improve an initial assignment.
