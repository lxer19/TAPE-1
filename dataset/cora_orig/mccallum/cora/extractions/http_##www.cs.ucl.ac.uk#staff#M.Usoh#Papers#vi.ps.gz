Abstract: A key problem in object recognition is to evaluate the set of possible interpretations of a scene in near real-time. The SIMD parallel algorithm of Holder & Buxton [4] has been extended to deal with objects containing developable surfaces by incorporating the surface normal and axis of cone and cylinder primitives in CSG models into the matching scheme. There is no time penalty for this extension. In addition, an improved sorting to find consistent interpretations is presented which results in matching times of up to 1000 times faster over the earlier sorting technique to give total matching times of 0.17-0.56 seconds for the example scenes considered here. The geometrical transformations recovered in the validation phase are also found to be extremely accurate in the closed form tests which promises that the technique should find practical application.

Reference-contexts: An immediate example is robotic vision where 'the key task for the robot's vision system is to supply the control unit with a quantitative and symbolic description of its surroundings' <ref> [1] </ref>. This may range from the visualisation of simple geometric objects to complex multivarying scenes. Even a simple problem definition 'to identify an object from amongst a set of known objects and to locate it relative to a sensor' can break down into a set of extremely demanding operations [2]. <p> The remaining constraints adopt similar measurements of angles and detailed descriptions of these may be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. These constraints maintain a consistency in the interpretation tree which becomes more powerful as we move to deeper levels. One thing which is important to note when using edges in a matching algorithm is the ambiguity of direction. <p> It is necessary to ascertain the direction of the data edges relative to their corresponding model edges for the validation of the interpretation. As we are working with vectors the directions must be known when calculating the model rotation <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 Validation of Interpretations After obtaining a set of feasible interpretations, it cannot be guaranteed that these are consistent with the model. This is because the constraints are applied successively to pairs of data and are therefore local. <p> From the above example, two feasible interpretations result: Data Model Data Model 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 5 7 5 8 Interpretation 1 Interpretation 2 4.3 The Importance of Match Ordering Unlike the serial version of Murray and Cook <ref> [1] </ref> when considering edges, the data edges need not be sorted in order of length prior to the matching algorithm to achieve matching efficiency. This is because all data edges are checked against model edges in parallel. <p> The use of the planar curve normals in an edge based fashion means that, on entry to tree traversal, the direction signs of the normals will be known absolutely and can be used to determine the signs of 'true' edges more effectively <ref> [1] </ref>. Treating the normal as an edge means that it has a unit length of 1.0 and its 3D start point at the centre of the circular or elliptical planar curve. Figure 5 shows a number of primitives which can be represented in this way.

Reference-contexts: This may range from the visualisation of simple geometric objects to complex multivarying scenes. Even a simple problem definition 'to identify an object from amongst a set of known objects and to locate it relative to a sensor' can break down into a set of extremely demanding operations <ref> [2] </ref>. The major problem with any recognition system is the task of investigating a vast number of possible interpretations of a scene, and to do so in real-time. The ability for humans to do this is often thought of as trivial but, on consideration, this is definitely not the case. <p> The second is the use of a faster machine and thus, parallel processing. The parallel matching algorithm devised by Holder and Buxton (H&B) [3] and based on work by Grimson and Lozano-Prez <ref> [2] </ref> uses SIMD parallelism on the DAP in order to obtain a much reduced program run time. A parallel method has also been adopted by Flynn and Harris (F&H) on the Connection Machine [5]. The parallelism of H&B when compared with F&H is very effective.

Reference-contexts: Attempts have been made to reduce the process time wasted on spurious scene interpretations by adopting a number of local constraints which are applied to an 'interpretation tree' of the scene space. Other methods have included the introduction of parallelism on SIMD machines, namely the AMT DAP [4], <ref> [3] </ref> and the Connection Machine [5], [6]. A problem with many recognition approaches which use motion or stereo data is that they only deal with polyhedral objects in the form of faces, edges, or vertices. <p> These are all treated as 'real' edges and processing proceeds using the Grimson & Lozano-Prez matching paradigm in an extension of the parallel matching algorithm of Holder & Buxton <ref> [3] </ref>. We also show that match ordering of this algorithm is very important and present a new sorting technique which, in tests conducted, has shown a significant increase in speed in terms of the total matching time over that of [3]. 2 The Grimson and Lozano-Prez Matching Paradigm Many algorithms have <p> extension of the parallel matching algorithm of Holder & Buxton <ref> [3] </ref>. We also show that match ordering of this algorithm is very important and present a new sorting technique which, in tests conducted, has shown a significant increase in speed in terms of the total matching time over that of [3]. 2 The Grimson and Lozano-Prez Matching Paradigm Many algorithms have been developed in recent years to match scene data to object models held in memory. They have relied on dynamically growing and pruning an interpretation tree built up from information received from the scene. <p> The first is to heavily prune the interpretation tree, thus leaving a fraction of the original to be investigated. The second is the use of a faster machine and thus, parallel processing. The parallel matching algorithm devised by Holder and Buxton (H&B) <ref> [3] </ref> and based on work by Grimson and Lozano-Prez [2] uses SIMD parallelism on the DAP in order to obtain a much reduced program run time. A parallel method has also been adopted by Flynn and Harris (F&H) on the Connection Machine [5]. <p> Also, for 250 objects, each with 10 faces and 3 data measurements, F&H required 250,000 of the 256,000 processors on the MIT Connection Machine <ref> [3] </ref>. This will rise by a factor of 10 with each additional data point as they require a separate 3 processor for each interpretation. A comparison of run times for the two methods using a simple chipped block model, composed of seven faces, is shown in Figure 2. <p> A developable surface is defined as belonging to the group of surfaces which has one principal curvature equal to zero. Using such a surface, we ensure that an axis of rotation will exist. The parallel implementation is equivalent to that described in <ref> [3] </ref> with the exception that, given a priori knowledge of match feature type, a curve edge is only permitted to pair with another curve edge. This also applies to true and axis edges.

However, according to Holder and Buxton <ref> [4] </ref>, the traversal of the interpretation tree is made more efficient by considering the data pairs in order of the least number of matches. The data pairs are thus sorted in a list accordingly.

The parallelism of H&B when compared with F&H is very effective. They found that with n model faces and m data points, n m processing elements are required to achieve a processing time of the same order of magnitude.

Reference-contexts: Each interpretation is therefore tested to: Determine the actual transformation parameters from model space to sensor space. Confirm that each data edge lies sufficiently close to its particular model edge. The transformation is found using the quaternion method of Faugeras and Hbert <ref> [7] </ref> as an average of all the data edges by assuming that a vector v m in model space is transformed into sensor space by v s = S [R]v m + t where S is the scaling, R is the rotation, and t is the translation.

Reference-contexts: It is not strictly necessary that a 'real' planar curve must be present for the described method to work. The planar curve which is inferred by a cylindrical cutout may be recovered and used in the algorithm. This is possible using the stereopsis based TINA system <ref> [8] </ref>. Also, the deduced axis of rotation of the cylindrical cutout may also be used (depending on whether recovery is possible) in this approach.

Reference-contexts: Results have been very promising and comparable to those obtained for true edge analysis. Here, we present results of an application of the planar curve parallel matcher on the three data scenes generated using a CAD-based parallel solid modeller <ref> [9] </ref>. The matching features were subsequently recovered using the TINA stereoscopic system. The models are presented in Figure 7. They are described, where available, in terms of true, axis, and curve edges.
