Title: Performance Analysis of The Access Channel of a CDMA Wireless Communication Network  
Author: Houman Alborzi and Hesham El Gamal 
Date: December 24, 1997  
Abstract: In this report, we present the result of the performance analysis of a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) wireless access channel. In this multiple access scheme the access channel is allowed to share the same bandwidth allocated for the traffic channels. The technique used in the study was the simulation, although we used some analytical results as guidelines. The effect of different factors (related to the physical and data link layer) are discussed and verified through simulation.
