Abstract: This work presents a SAR image segmentation scheme consisting of a sequence of four modules, all selected from the literature. These modules are: i) a speckle model-free contour detector that is the core of the segmentation scheme; ii) a geometrical procedure to detect closed regions from non-connected contours; iii) a region growing procedure whose merging rules exploit local image properties, both topological and spectral, to eliminate artifacts and reduce oversegmentation introduced by the second stage; iv) a neural network clustering algorithm to detect global image regularities in the sequence of within-segment properties extracted from the partitioned image provided by the third stage. In the framework of a commercial image-processing software toolbox, the proposed SAR image segmentation scheme employs a contour detector that is promising because: i) it is easy to use, requiring the user to select only one contrast threshold as a relative number; and ii) it exploits no prior domain-specific knowledge about the data source and the content of the scene, i.e., it is capable of processing SAR images as well as both achromatic and multi-spectral optical images. The segmentation scheme is tested on three images acquired by different SAR sensors. The robustness of the segmentation method is assessed by changing only one parameter of the procedure in the different experiments. Experimental results are interpreted as an encouragement to focus further multidisciplinary research on how to combine responses of multi-scale filter banks in low-level visual systems.

To take this debate into account, we have attempted to make this paper as "focused on its very original core" as possible [4]. This original core is regarded as a set of useful items that a broad scientific audience would like to include in commercial image-processing all-purpose software toolboxes [4]. <p> [1]-<ref> [4] </ref>.

This original core is regarded as a set of useful items that a broad scientific audience would like to include in commercial image-processing all-purpose software toolboxes [4]. <p> Experimental results show that segmented images generated with this procedure are oversegmented for classification tasks. To reduce oversegmentation, an alternative SAR image segmentation procedure consisting of processing blocks taken from the literature is proposed. Thus, we do not claim to present yet another picture segmentation algorithm <ref> [4] </ref>. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly overviews models of the speckled scene. Section 3 points out the relationship between adaptive speckle filters and speckle contour detectors. Section 4 discusses the state of the art in SAR image segmentation schemes.

Reference-contexts: Among these filters, the well-known Refined Gamma-Gamma (to indicate Gamma pdfs for both speckle and noise-free reflectivity of the true scene) Maximum A Posteriori speckle filter (RGGMAP, [14], [15], <ref> [24] </ref>) improves the original GGMAP single-point filter expression by including structural detectors. These are (odd-symmetric) difference of boxes operators, iii capable of detecting step edges, and even-symmetric operators, capable of detecting ridges, employed in the filtering process to delimit the homogeneous neighborhood on which local statistics are estimated [14]-[16]. <p> An explicit dependence of adaptive speckle filters on speckle contour detectors is found in the class of adaptive speckle filters featuring region-based estimation of local statistics <ref> [24] </ref>, [27]. These filters are two-stage procedures, the first stage performing segmentation and the second filtering. <p> consisting of: a) a contour detector incorporating a speckle model, such as the well-known Constant False Alarm (CFAR) edge detector [28]; and b) a (speckle model-free) segmentation module generating connected regions from non-connected contours based on geometric information exclusively (i.e., no radiometric values are employed at this stage) [6], [7], <ref> [24] </ref>. <p> The CFAR edge detector, proposed in [28], is a well-known example of speckle model-based contour detector employed for segmentation purposes [6], [7], <ref> [24] </ref>. Since speckle contour detection principles are included in adaptive speckle filters (see Section 3), we consider the first class of SAR image segmentation algorithms, where an adaptive speckle filter is employed, as a subset of the second class of SAR image segmentation algorithms centered on speckle contour detection. <p> Since this approach is applicable only to noise-free textured images formed by known textures [45], it does not satisfy our unsupervised learning requirements either. 4.1 Assessment of the CFAR-based segmentation scheme The hybrid segmentation procedure employed in [6] and [7] for classification purposes and in <ref> [24] </ref> for filtering purposes is fully automatic and based on the well-known, speckle model-based CFAR edge detector [28] (see Section 3). According to these observations the CFAR-based hybrid segmentation scheme is selected as a significant example in the class of SAR image segmentation systems based on contour detection. <p> To assess how well the segmentation procedure fits the final goal of our treatment, i.e., segmentation for classification, we can only inspect the segmented output image qualitatively (see Section 7.1 for more details). On the other hand, in line with <ref> [24] </ref>, the region-based GGMAP speckle filtering stage is applied in cascade to the segmentation block to assess how well the same CFAR-based segmentation scheme performs in a processing framework different from classification such as speckle filtering. <p> It is known that difference of boxes v operators are optimal step edge detectors [47]. This implies that CFAR is not designed to optimally detect other image structures such as roofs and ramp edges <ref> [24] </ref>, [40], [42]. * The activation function of each (difference of boxes) operator is defined as the minimum ratio between the two absolute values computed by convolving the image with the two opposite sides of the odd-symmetric filter. <p> Fig. 7, featuring 142 : 055 segments (where each contour pixel found in Fig. 6 is considered as a segment on its own), is clearly oversegmented for classification purposes. Fig. 8, featuring EN L = 800, shows the result of region-based GGMAP speckle filtering <ref> [24] </ref>. The filtered image is satisfactory both in terms of speckle noise removal and qualitative preservation of small structures. <p> Fig. 11, featuring 60 : 786 segments (where each contour xi xii pixel found in Fig. 10 is considered as a segment on its own), is clearly oversegmented for classification purposes. Fig. 12, featuring EN L = 370, shows the result of region-based GGMAP speckle filtering <ref> [24] </ref>. The filtered image is satisfactory both in terms of speckle noise removal and qualitative preservation of small structures. <p> The first conclusion emerging from this brief review of contour detectors is that the combination of even- and odd-symmetric filters working at different scales of analysis, rather than their separate processing, is fundamental in detecting image structures as well as texture boundaries <ref> [24] </ref>. The second observation is that speckle model-based CFAR employs a completely generic filter bank consisting of odd-symmetric (difference of boxes) filters to compute the oriented first derivative of image intensity. <p> The segmentation approach that exploits CACD as its first processing block is the same as that employed in Section 4 [6], [7], <ref> [24] </ref>. <p> Fig. 15, featuring EN L = 195, shows the result of region-based GGMAP speckle filtering <ref> [24] </ref>. When compared to Fig. 4, Fig. 15 shows that some thin/small image details are removed or blurred; thus, a refinement in the strategy employed by CACD to combine multi-scale filter signals is recommended. This new strategy should also improve CACD performance in detecting T- and X-junctions. <p> Fig. 19, featuring EN L = 1240, shows the result of region-based GGMAP speckle filtering <ref> [24] </ref>, where some thin/small image details are removed or blurred. In line with the first spaceborne SAR image example, this airborne SAR image case confirms that the strategy employed by CACD to combine multi-scale filter signals must be improved. <p> Fig. 22, featuring EN L = 1150, shows the result of region-based GGMAP speckle filtering <ref> [24] </ref>, where some thin/small image details are removed or blurred. In line with the previous test cases, this airborne SAR example confirms that the strategy employed by CACD in combining multi-scale filter signals must be improved. <p> xxiv computation time, the use of CACD in place of CFAR allows a significant reduction ( 77%) in the number of segments to be further reduced by time-consuming region growing blocks employed in cascade. 6 Implementing a SAR image segmentation scheme Within the hybrid segmentation scheme proposed in [6], [7], <ref> [24] </ref>, CFAR exploits prior knowledge concerning speckle and is fully automatic, but it generates images that are over-segmented for classification purposes. Besides, a non-automatic version of CFAR is not conceivable, as it would require the end user to fine-tune a complex hierarchy of decisions regarding edge thresholding. <p> Our proposal is to employ CACD as the core of a speckle model-free SAR image segmentation scheme that takes its inspiration from the SAR filtering procedure proposed in <ref> [24] </ref>. <p> extracted from non-connected contours are not acceptable in a classification framework (while they are more acceptable when speckle filtering is the final goal of the treatment, see Figs. 4, 8, 12), region merging blocks capable of eliminating artifacts must be added to the basic segmentation scheme proposed in [6], [7], <ref> [24] </ref>. Incidentally, since CACD works on both monochromatic and multi-spectral optical images, we propose a unified framework capable xxv xxvi xxvii xxviii of segmenting: i) incoherent (optical) or coherent (SAR) images; and ii) multi-spectral or monochromatic images.

Reference-contexts: Finally, neurophysiology may provide useful information on how the mammalian Primary Visual Cortex (PVC) employs multi-scale filter banks in low-level vision [33]-[43]. This scenario is consistent with the multidisciplinary effort urged to develop the new science of complex systems <ref> [44] </ref>. It is to be observed that several segmentation algorithms presented in the literature to provide solutions that are statistically sound according to Bayes' rule do not satisfy the requirements of our SAR image segmentation task. <p> it also reduces processing time required to run region growing techniques employed in cascade to eliminate artifacts; ii) the same segmentation scheme can be employed to segment SAR images as well as monochromatic and multi-spectral incoherent imagery; and iii) multidisciplinary knowledge (stemming from neurophysiology, psychophysics, computer vision and image processing <ref> [44] </ref>) can be employed to improve the processing scheme. The limitations of the CACD-based approach to SAR image segmentation are that: i) small/thin details are lost in airborne SAR images; ii) T- and X-junctions are poorly detected; and iii) region growing techniques are required to eliminate artifacts and reduce oversegmentation.
