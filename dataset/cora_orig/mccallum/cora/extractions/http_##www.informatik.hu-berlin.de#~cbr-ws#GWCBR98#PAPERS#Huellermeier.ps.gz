Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of case-based probability as an heuristic principle for the assessment of probability distributions characterizing situations of uncertainty. Based on this principle, an approach to case-based decision making is outlined. It is argued that this approach, which combines ideas from case-based reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, and decision theory, may provide a useful alternative theory of rationality for resource-limited agents.

Reference-contexts: This principle exactly reflects what we will now define formally as case-based probability. 2.1 Formal Model of Cbp Let S denote a class of (problem) situations, and let P be a class of probability measures P : A ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ; where A 2 is a -algebra. P is assumed to be closed under convex combination. A case is defined as a tuple hS; Pi 2 S fi P. <p> Moreover, suppose that a similarity function sim : S fi S ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is defined. Generally, similarity functions are supposed to satisfy certain assumptions such as, e.g., symmetry. <p> Suppose we are given a set S of situations, a set A of possible acts, and a set R of results. We define the set of decision situations as S 0 := S fi A. Let sim : S 0 fi S 0 ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> be a similarity measure. Suppose that the result associated with a decision situation S 0 = (S; a) 2 S 0 is a random variable modelled by some probability measure P 2 P. <p> The basic model proposed in <ref> [1] </ref>, in which an agent is viewed as a decision maker with beliefs, preferences, and a decision strategy, seems to be well-suited for realizing Dm-Cpb agents. Next to investigating Cbp and DmCbp further from a theoretical point of view this application is a central topic of future research.

Reference-contexts: Ideas from decision theory now dominate an important direction in the mod-elling of rationality, one of the major research directions in AI <ref> [2] </ref>. Particularly, decision theory does contribute to the design of rational agents. The agent paradigm has received considerable attention within AI research since the late 1980s. <p> This approach naturally gives rise to the notion of satisficing behavior: The model can be seen as a formalization of Simon's idea of satisficing decisions [6]. Therefore, the problem-solving rationality <ref> [2] </ref> or approximate rationality [6] implied by the satisficing character of case-based decision making agents may provide a useful alternative theory of rationality and resource-bounded reasoning for (time/knowledge) limited agents.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The concepts of probability and utility are well established and have been used extensively in connection with game theory or decision making under uncertainty. Recently, Gilboa and Schmeidler <ref> [3] </ref> have proposed a decision theory in which the concept of similarity (next to utility) plays an important role. Moreover, during the last years this concept has also become a focus of attention within other research fields. <p> This definition, which realizes some kind of interpolative reasoning, is closely related to the definition of case-based utility in the approach of Gilboa 1 The fact that P is indeed a probability measure is obvious. and Schmeidler <ref> [3] </ref>. Their case-based decision theory (Cbdt) assumes a set M of triples (q; a; r), where q is a problem situation, a is an act (a decision), and r is the consequence resulting from that act in the corresponding situation. <p> Of course, other approximations of the (unknown) distribution P are possible as well, i.e., (1) seems somehow arbitrary. This problem is also mentioned in <ref> [3] </ref> in connection with (2). Nevertheless, as long as we do not have any hints at a different measure with better properties, (1) should be seen as a first "ad-hoc" formalization of our heuristic principle. <p> It seems relatively unlikely that (artificial) decision makers can consider all these questions when facing sequences of heterogeneous and complex decision situations. Indeed, it has long been realized that perfect rationality is not realizable for limited agents. As pointed out in <ref> [3] </ref>, case-based decision making provides a more faithful description of human decision making based on a less idealized paradigm. This approach naturally gives rise to the notion of satisficing behavior: The model can be seen as a formalization of Simon's idea of satisficing decisions [6]. <p> Based on the idea of Cbp we have outlined the approach of DmCbp to case-based decision making which is inspired by and closely related to the method proposed in <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The characterization (p; a; r) of a situation in Cbdt includes an act a. Since the primary concern of this approach is to estimate the utility of each possible act, the summation in (2) takes only cases with the same act into account (see, however, <ref> [4] </ref>.) In our approach a situation is simply given as a tuple hS; P i, i.e., it (apparently) does not include an act.

Reference-contexts: It is based upon the notion of reactive, autonomous, internally motivated entities embedded in changing, uncertain worlds which they perceive and in which they act. Expected utility theory is the predominant paradigm for decision making in the face of uncertainty and one of the guiding principles of rational agents <ref> [5] </ref>. However, evidence has been accumulating that the theory is often too restrictive and demanding for practical applications: In order to maximize expected utility, an agent would have to know all possible "states of the world" and all possible outcomes associated with different acts and states.

Reference-contexts: The principle of similarity seems to be predominant in human (commonsense) reasoning. The finding that people rely on similarity as an heuristic principle for assessing the probability of an uncertain event or the value of an uncertain quantity was made by Tversky and Kahneman in various psychological studies <ref> [7] </ref>. The authors call this heuristic approach representativeness principle. For example, the probability that a person has a certain job is assessed by the degree to which this person is similar to the stereotype of a person having this job.
