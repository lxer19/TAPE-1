Title: Combinatorial algorithms for DNA sequence assembly  
Author: John D. Kececioglu Eugene W. Myers 
Keyword: Computational biology, branch and bound algorithms, approxima tion algorithms, fragment assembly, sequence reconstruction

Abstract: The trend towards very large DNA sequencing projects, such as those being undertaken as part of the human genome initiative, necessitates the development of efficient and precise algorithms for assembling a long DNA sequence from the fragments obtained by shotgun sequencing or other methods. The sequence reconstruction problem that we take as our formulation of DNA sequence assembly is a variation of the shortest common superstring problem, complicated by the presence of sequencing errors and reverse complements of fragments. Since the simpler superstring problem is NP-hard, any efficient reconstruction procedure must resort to heuristics. In this paper, however, a four phase approach based on rigorous design criteria is presented, and has been found to be very accurate in practice. Our method is robust in the sense that it can accommodate high sequencing error rates and list a series of alternate solutions in the event that several appear equally good. Moreover it uses a limited form of multiple sequence alignment to detect, and often correct, errors in the data. Our combined algorithm has successfully reconstructed non-repetitive sequences of length 50,000 sampled at error rates of as high as 10 percent.

Reference-contexts: Another weakness of our method is that it artificially separates orientation and layout. (See <ref> [18] </ref> for an explanation of why this is necessary, given our choice of a relaxation to maximum weight branchings.) As we have noted, solving each of these problems optimally does not guarantee an optimal solution to the combined reconstruction problem. What is desired is an algorithm that solves both simultaneously.

Reference-contexts: Our intention here was to explore the robustness of our approach to error in the data. A random sequence has no structure, while biological sequences contain repeats. In the remaining experiments, numbered 4 through 12, we used the human fi-like globin gene cluster sequence <ref> [23] </ref>. This 73,360 character sequence contains many approximate repeats, and presents a challenging reconstruction problem. Thirteen short interspersed Alu repeats are present, nine in the forward direction and four in the reverse, as well as eight long interspersed L1Hs repeats, of which two are forward and six reversed.
