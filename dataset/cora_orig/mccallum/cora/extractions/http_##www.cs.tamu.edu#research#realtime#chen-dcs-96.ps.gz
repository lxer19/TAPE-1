Abstract: When a computer network is used to support mission-critical applications, meeting delay requirements is a key issue that has to be addressed. In this paper, we study high performance networks with wormhole routing and investigate their performance in terms of meeting message delay constraints. We found that in this kind of network, transmission control at the source node plays an important role in supporting real-time traffic. Traditional system uses unregulated greedy transmission control. This may result in unfairness of network access and unbounded packet blocking time, making it very difficult to efficiently support real-time applications. To overcome this problem, we propose a regulated transmission control method in which packet transmission at the source is regulated and hence unnecessary network contention is eliminated. The regulated method is a generalization of the unregulated method and can be easily implemented in most of the commercially available networks. We evaluate and compare both transmission control methods in terms of the worst case achievable utilization (WCAU). This metric is important to real-time applications as it is related to predictability and stability of the system. With this metric we show that the regulated method performs much better than the unregulated one and has a potential application in practical systems.

Reference-contexts: The performance metric chosen has been the worst case achievable utilization (WCAU) [15]. WCAU specifies an utilization bound under which all the message sets can be guaranteed to meet their deadlines. WCAU has been used as an important criterion for evaluating real-time systems <ref> [1, 19, 23] </ref>. We find that with proper parameter setting, the regulated method can approximately achieve the worst case utilization of 50%. The unregulated method, however, has a much lower WCAU. Its WCAU reduces exponentially and approaches zero as the network becomes very large. <p> The discussion of real-time communications in packet-switched networks has been presented in [13, 14, 16, 20]. Guaranteeing message deadlines with different medium access control protocols have been studied, e.g., IEEE 802.5 token ring [21, 22], Slot ring [23], DQDB [24], FDDI <ref> [1, 25] </ref> and ATM [26, 27, 28]. The work on packet-switched networks and medium access control protocols provides valuable insight into the problem of real-time communications. However, the network we consider here is different from those mentioned above. The network with wormhole routing features limited message buffering and pipeline transmission. <p> This metric was proposed by Liu and Layland [15] and has been used widely as a performance metric for real-time systems <ref> [1, 19, 23] </ref>. The major advantages of this metric are as follows [1, 15]: * This metric evaluates the predictability of a real-time system. <p> This metric was proposed by Liu and Layland [15] and has been used widely as a performance metric for real-time systems [1, 19, 23].

Wormhole routing was introduced as a fast switching technique for direct networks by Seitz and Dally <ref> [9] </ref>. It features pipelined transmission, low storage requirements on the routers, and low transmission overhead. With wormhole routing, the header flit of a packet governs the route. As the header of a packet advances along the specified route, the remaining flits follow in a pipelined fashion.

Reference-contexts: The discussion of real-time communications in packet-switched networks has been presented in [13, 14, 16, 20]. Guaranteeing message deadlines with different medium access control protocols have been studied, e.g., IEEE 802.5 token ring [21, 22], Slot ring [23], DQDB <ref> [24] </ref>, FDDI [1, 25] and ATM [26, 27, 28]. The work on packet-switched networks and medium access control protocols provides valuable insight into the problem of real-time communications. However, the network we consider here is different from those mentioned above. <p> This is a significant improvement over the unregulated transmission control. 6 Conclusion Meeting message deadline constraints in communication networks is an important issue for many distributed computer applications <ref> [1, 3, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 21, 24, 25, 27] </ref>. In this paper, we have addressed this issue for the networks with wormhole routing. These networks have been used in many mission-critical high-performance computing systems.
