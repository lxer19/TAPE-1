Title: Transverse Multibunch Head-Tail Mode Growth Rates in the  
Author: PEP-II B-Factory J. Scott Berg 
Date: July 7, 1995  
Pubnum: PEP-II AP Note 95-16  
Abstract: The growth rates for the transverse multibunch head-tail modes (m = 1) are computed for the PEP-II B-Factory, including effects of multibunch mode coupling. The growth rates are found to be significantly above the radiation damping rate. The primary cause of this effect are two of the cavity higher order modes. Since these two modes happen to be separated by almost exactly the bunch frequency, reduction of these mode frequencies is more difficult than one may at first expect. Multibunch mode coupling gives a non-negligible effect on the growth rates. Requirements for damping the cavity higher order modes are given for several examples of parameters of the PEP-II rings.

Reference-contexts: Considering this, a more appropriate cutoff may have been around 10 GHz [Hei]. There is also need for further study of what exactly the cutoff frequency should be; the value of the cutoff frequency has a strong effect <ref> [Ber] </ref>. 2 The impedance due to the cavity tails is modeled by taking a model of the cavity run through ABCI [HKN + 95, Hei] and fitting the tail for a ! 1=2 coefficient. <p> This effect depends strongly on the broadband impedance as well as the narrow band impedance. In fact, a seemingly minor change in the broadband impedance (cutting it off at high frequency) had a very noticable effect on the multibunch modes <ref> [Ber] </ref>. Thus, it is important to have a good model for the broadband impedance; more work needs to be done in this area. 5.1.3 Damping of Cavity Modes Assume that the growth rates due to the cavity modes are to be reduced by de-Qing the cavity higher order modes.

(!) = (1 i!=! c ) 3=2 ; (3) since the wakefield W (t ) corresponding to this is zero at t = 0, whereas the wakefield corresponding to equation (2) is nonzero at t = 0 (see <ref> [Cha93] </ref>, p. 61). The 3=2 power rolloff is chosen based on the assumption that the high frequency behavior is governed by the average behavior of the high frequency resonances of the structures producing the inductance [Hei].
