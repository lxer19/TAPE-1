Abstract: A noncontact sensor based on the interaction of a person with electric fields for human-computer interface is investigated. Two sensing modes are explored: an external electric field shunted to ground through a human body, and an external electric field transmitted through a human body to stationary receivers. The sensors are low power (milliwatts), high resolution (millimeter) low cost (a few dollars per channel), have low latency (millisecond), high update rate (1 kHz), high immunity to noise (&gt;72 dB), are not affected by clothing, surface texture or reflectivity, and can operate on length scales from microns to meters. Systems incorporating the sensors include a finger mouse, a room that knows the location of its occupant, and peoplesensing furniture. Haptic feedback using passive materials is described. Also discussed are empirical and analytical approaches to transform sensor measurements into position information. KEYWORDS: user interface, input device, gesture interface, noncontact sensing, electric field.

Reference-contexts: Electrical impedance tomography places electrode arrays on the body to form images of tissue and organs based on internal electric conductivity [21]. Weakly electric fish (e.g., Gymnotiformes, sharks, and catfish) are very sophisticated users of electric fields <ref> [1] </ref>. These fish use amplitude modulation and spectral changes to determine object size, shape, conductivity, distance, and velocity. They use electric fields for social communication, identifying sex, age, and dominance hierarchy. <p> Information can be coded in the modulated transmitter signal. A multitude of small EF sensing devices can be scattered about a room, like eels in a murky pond, transmitting measurements to neighboring devices with the same EF used to measure proximity. The jamming avoidance mechanism of weakly electric fish <ref> [1] </ref> suggests that such devices can adjust their transmission frequencies autonomously when new devices are introduced into the sensing space . Small displacement currents require good shielding, however the capacitance of shielded coaxial cable is orders of magnitude greater that the capacitance between electrodes.

Reference-contexts: When an electrode under a person is activated, that person becomes the EF source. Smart floors can be used for multiparticipant VR simulations without the burden of wires or the complexities of video cameras. Attempts have been made to instrument whiteboards using video cameras [11] and optoelectronics <ref> [2] </ref>. Both systems require rear imaging to record stylus movement. A conventional plastic whiteboard can be fitted with an array of EF sensing electrodes to measure the location of a metal-cased marker in the hand of a shunting or transmitting person.

Reference-contexts: Transmitter Power The frequency range we use for EF HCI is 10 kHz to 200 kHz. Below this range, displacement currents and update rates are too small. Above this range FCC power regulations become more stringent <ref> [3] </ref>. The distance between electrodes is a fraction of a wavelength, so no appreciable energy is radiated. The only power consumed by the transmitter is the energy required to charge the capacitance of the transmitter electrode to the oscillating voltage. In practice the transmitter power is less than a milliwatt.

Reference-contexts: PREVIOUS WORK The first well-known use of EF sensing for human-machine interface was Leon Theremins musical instrument. Two omnidirectional antennas were used to control the pitch and amplitude of an oscillator. Body capacitance detunes a resonant tank circuit <ref> [7] </ref>. The effect of body capacitance on electric circuits was well known to radios pioneers, who saw the effect as an annoyance rather than an asset.

Reference-contexts: The capacitance and displacement currents for EF sensing are on the order of picofarads (10 -12 farad) and nanoamps (10 -9 amps), requiring more sophisticated detection strategies. A synchronous detection circuit (Figure 3) is used to detect the transmitted frequency and reject all others <ref> [10] </ref>, acting as a very narrow bandpass filter. Other detection methods include frequency-modulation chirps (as used in radar), frequency hopping, and code modulation (e.g., spread spectrum). The displacement current can be measured with approximately 12 bits accuracy (72 dB) using the components shown in Figure 3.

Reference-contexts: Microwaves pose potential health and regulation problems. Simple pyroelectric systems have very slow response times (&gt;100 msec) and can only respond to changing signals. Lasers must be scanned, can cause eye damage, and are line-of-sight. Triboelectric sensing requires the detected object to be electrically charged.
