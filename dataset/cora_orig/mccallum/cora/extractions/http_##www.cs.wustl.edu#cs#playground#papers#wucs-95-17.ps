Functional components of a concurrent system are written as encapsulated application programs that act upon local data structures, some of which may be published for external use.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Programmers' Playground <ref> [GSA + 95] </ref> is a software library and run-time system designed to support end-user construction of distributed multimedia applications. Design goals include the separation of communication from computation, dynamic reconfiguration, and the uniform treatment of discrete and continuous data types. <p> For the purposes of this paper, the Playground programming model is taken as "given." Information on related programming models and details about the Programmers' Playground goals, design, implementation may be found elsewhere <ref> [ea95, GSA + 95] </ref>. Playground provides a model of interprocess communication in which each application in a system has a presentation that consists of data structures that may be externally observed and/or manipulated by its environment.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the model can be used for carrying out complexity analysis and for proving impossibility results. The I/O automaton model is significantly different from CCS [Mil89] and CSP <ref> [Hoa85] </ref> in that input and output actions in the I/O automaton model are distinguished, and an I/O automaton cannot block an input action from occurring. In that sense, I/O automata are similar to I/O-systems [Jon85, Jon90, Jon91].

Reference-contexts: The Playground programming model is based on ideas from fl This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant CCR-94-12711. 1 the formal I/O automaton model of Lynch and Tuttle <ref> [LT89] </ref>, a natural model of distributed sys-tems that provides compositionality properties and a clear separation of input and output actions. However, there are important semantic differences between the Playground semantics and the I/O automaton model, particularly in terms of asynchrony and in the handling of input actions. <p> The paper concludes with a discussion of the utility of this formal framework for the study of additional communication and synchronization features that are envisioned for the Playground programming model and run-time system. 2 The I/O Automaton Model This section provides a brief overview of the I/O automaton model <ref> [LT89] </ref>. The model is both the basis for the Playground programming model and the formal framework we will use to describe the Playground semantics and implementation. <p> In that sense, I/O automata are similar to I/O-systems [Jon85, Jon90, Jon91]. The following introduction to the model is adapted from <ref> [LT89] </ref>, which explains the model in more detail, presents examples, and includes comparisons to other models. Readers already familiar with the I/O automaton model may skip this section without loss of continuity. 2.1 I/O Automata I/O automata are best suited for modeling systems in which the components operate asynchronously. <p> When an execution of a system is projected onto any component, the result is an execution of that component. The same is true for schedules and behaviors. Other important compositionality results for I/O automata may be found in <ref> [LT89] </ref>. 2.3 Fairness We may think of each class in the partition of locally-controlled actions of an automaton as a separate "control thread" that is responsible for the actions in that class. <p> Informally, a module preserves a property P iff the module is not the first to violate P: as long as the environment only provides inputs such that the cumulative behavior satisfies P, the module will only perform outputs such that the cumulative behavior satisfies P. In <ref> [LT89] </ref>, it is shown that if each component of a composition preserves a property, then the composition preserves the property.
