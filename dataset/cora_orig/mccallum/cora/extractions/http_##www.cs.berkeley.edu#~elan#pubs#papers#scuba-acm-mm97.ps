Title: Receiver-driven Bandwidth Adaptation for Light-weight Sessions  
Author: Elan Amir, Steven McCanne, and Randy Katz 
Address: Berkeley  
Affiliation: University of California,  
Abstract: Current Internet multicast conferencing tools treat all sources with equal importance in that they either statically allocate a fixed bandwidth to each source in a session, or they automatically adapt each source's transmission rate independently of all other sources. But not all sources are of equal interest to all receivers. We believe that to effectively support human to human communication, this disparity in receiver interest should be reflected in the rate-adaptation process. To this end, we propose a protocol called SCUBA that enables media sources to intelligently account for receiver interest in their rate-adjustment algorithms. SCUBA is orthogonal to and complements existing rate-adaptation schemes and can interoperate with either sender- or receiver-directed control systems. To scale the SCUBA protocol with multicast session size, we decouple the receiver-feedback process from the session size through sampling. This approach introduces a tunable tradeoff between convergence time and sampling accuracy that for large sessions is solely dependent on the control traffic bandwidth. In addition to its applicability in video conferencing, our control scheme can be combined with media transcoders to intelligently manage a bottleneck link at a well-known and fixed location in the network. We implemented SCUBA within our video conferencing tool vic and our media gateway rtpgw and feedback from their preliminary deployment indicates that the efficacy of the overall multimedia communication system has been greatly enhanced.

Reference-contexts: Running each source at the rate of the slowest link is clearly undesirable and prevents well-connected receivers from fully exploiting their available bandwidth. This limitation can be overcome with a layered transmission scheme <ref> [1, 17, 21, 22] </ref>. In this model each source generates a layered media stream that is striped across multiple network channels.

Reference-contexts: We initially set out to develop a robust, distributed protocol for the control of application-level media gateways <ref> [2] </ref>, but as the protocol was refined and tuned for this specific application, it became apparent that SCUBA constituted a robust and useful building block in its own right. This section details three applications that show how side-information generated by SCUBA can improve their perfor mance. <p> For example, a user might tap into an MBone conference via ISDN or a high-speed modem; alternatively, multiple receivers might share a low-speed wireless link. Media gateways <ref> [2] </ref> are one approach for managing network bandwidth in these environments. In this model, a gateway sits on the well-connected portion of the network and manages the bottleneck link by limiting the rate of incoming media streams through transcoding. <p> augment floor control protocols through the integra ACM Multimedia November 1997 Seattle, WA 11 tion of receiver interest. 5 Status and Future Work To demonstrate a proof of concept of our design work, we implemented SCUBA in both our video conferencing tool, vic [16], and our our media gateway, rtpgw <ref> [2] </ref>. These implementations follow the algorithms detailed in Section 2.2 and illustrated in Figure 3. In conjunction with our SCUBA-enhanced vic, we deployed and controlled these gateways in the manner described in Section 4.2.

Reference-contexts: maintained at the source, we constrain the sum of weights in a report to be 1, i.e., N1 X w j;i = 1 8i Now the expression for w k is simply: w k = M i=0 To enhance SCUBA's robustness, we deliberately designed the protocol using only soft state <ref> [6] </ref>. Sources and receivers can join and leave the session at will without impacting other session members. None of the state maintained at any source alone is critical to the correct execution of the algorithm since all state eventually times out and is refreshed by receiver reports.
