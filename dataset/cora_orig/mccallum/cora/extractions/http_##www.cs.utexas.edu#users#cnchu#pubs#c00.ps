Reference-contexts: It is known that every 2-D grid can be embedded into its optimal hypercube with at most dilation 2 [C1, C2], [HLV]. This result is optimal as it has been proven that over 38 percent of all 2-D grids need at least dilation 2 <ref> [BS] </ref>. However, not much is known about the optimal dilation for embedding 3-D grids into optimal hypercubes. A non-trivial extension of the technique in [C1, C2] for embedding 3-D grids into optimal hypercubes with at most dilation 7 was given by Chan in [C3].

(Note that in <ref> [HLV] </ref>, the embedding strategy was described for embedding a h fi w guest grid into a h 0 fi w 0 host grid where w 0 w and h 0 = dhw=w 0 e, here we swapped the roles of row and column for later convenience.) As the embedding is one-one, <p> Figure 1 shows an example of such an embedding. It is proven in <ref> [HLV] </ref> that this method yields a dilation-2 embedding for any ff fi fi guest grid.
