Abstract: This complex optimisation and scheduling problem is currently performed manually (albeit with some computerised assistance). This paper reports recent work aiming to automatically generate low cost schedules using genetic algorithms (GA) using the South Wales region as a demonstration network.

Section 2 describes the South Wales region high voltage network, Section 3 describes the fitness functions used in Sections 4 and 5 in which low cost schedules are produced, firstly without the network resilience requirement and secondly (in Section 5) when including it. <p> Section 5). In this second problem the true conductor rating were used. Considering potential network faults is highly CPU intensive and so the Genetic programming approach described in <ref> [LT97] </ref> did not attempt to solve the second version of the South Wales problem. 3 The Fitness Function The fitness function used by both GA and genetic programming (GP) approaches to scheduling maintenance in the South Wales region is based on that used in the four node problem. <p> On this version of the South Wales problem and using a population with seeded with the same (and other) heuristics, GP was able to find schedules with a cost of 388MW weeks albeit with far greater resources (e.g. the population was 1000) <ref> [LT97] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is anticipated that running on parallel machines will be required to solve the national problem using a GA or GP approach. However there are a number of techniques which could be used to contain run time. A Using QGAME QGAME <ref> [RT94] </ref> was used in all the GA experiments on grid scheduling problems. In every case the genetic algorithm contain a single population of 20 individuals, each contained a chromosome which consisted of a permutation of the lines to be scheduled. Permutation crossover and default parameters were used (see Table 1).
