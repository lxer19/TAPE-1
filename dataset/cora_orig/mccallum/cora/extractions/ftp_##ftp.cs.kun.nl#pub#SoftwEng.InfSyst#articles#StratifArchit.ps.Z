Abstract: In this paper we generalize the two level approach approach to hypertext (hypermedia) systems into stratified hypermedia structures. First we describe the overall architecture of such systems, including the fundamentals of the user interface. Thereafter, its various components are discussed. Special emphasis is paid to how the underlying information model is layered. Two layers are featured: the hyperbase and the hyper-index. A characterization calculus is presented for the characterization of structured elements. This calculus forms the basis of a logic-based approach in connection with the associated information processor (Disclosure Machine). The logic-based approach is considered as the most general approach to the retrieval process. In addition, this calculus is useful for quality assurance in hypermedia applications. Attention is also paid to spatial coherence for relevance judgements.

Reference-contexts: Several approaches can be recognized; in [Gar88] for example, a model of hypermedia is presented using first-order logic. In [Tom89] hypermedia is modelled in terms of hypergraphs. Recently, two level hypermedia architectures have been emerging. (See <ref> [BvdW90b, Luc90, AAC + 89, ACG91, GGP89] </ref>). Such architectures feature an upper level, the hyperindex comprising a hypertext of indexing information which indexes the lower level, the hyperbase. The hyperbase contains the actual information. In our approach, both layers will be organized as information models (see figure 2).

Reference-contexts: The hyperindex typically consists of a single view. Usually, this view is organized as a flat hypermedia. We present two examples of hyperindices. (A more sophisticated hyperindex in the form of a lattice of index expressions is described in <ref> [Bru90] </ref>). 2.6.1 A Vocabulary as Hyperindex In this section we describe an example of a hyperindex based on a set of index terms.

Reference-contexts: As the paradigm depicted in figure 1 does not cover important aspects relevant to the present day, we advocate considering information disclosure in a broader, more modern Information System Architecture. (See <ref> [Bub86] </ref>). Within this framework an information system is considered to have the following components (see figure 2): information processor ' $ information base conceptual description information model - information system user interface 1.

Reference-contexts: Browsing implies that the information need is not formulated into a request. Formulation of the need is acknowledged as being difficult and error prone. (See <ref> [Cle91] </ref>). Navigation is supported by advanced user interfaces, an aspect which is increasingly being recognized as something which influences the effectiveness of disclosing the underlying information. We therefore argue that the user interface should also be given consideration within the framework of the information disclosure paradigm.

Reference-contexts: The underlying conceptual model of these description languages is implicit in their definition, although it is recognized that the underlying conceptual model is important (see for example <ref> [Sch89] </ref> for a conceptual description of SGML). The concept of layer presented in the preceding sections is powerful enough to express the important aspects of these languages.

Reference-contexts: We use the term interlayer navigation as a generic term for traversal between layers. Relations between layers form the basis for interlayer navigation. The stratified hypermedia architecture consists of a number of layers and their interrelations (see also <ref> [SDBvdW91] </ref>). A layer offers the possibility to have different views on the same underlying base of fragments. Therefore, views not only allow modularization of the information, but also allow flexibility in the form of multiple views on the same information. Both aspects are generally recognized as desirable in hypermedia systems.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, state-of-the-art hyperme-dia systems, in contrast to conventional information systems, feature almost no conceptual description of the stored data. The weaknesses of such an approach have been discussed by several authors ([Gar88], <ref> [SF89] </ref>). There seems to be a growing need to be able to support a conceptual description with regard to both hypermedia and traditional document information systems. The combination of structured documents with hypermedia applications looks promising. This paper describes a stratified hypermedia architecture founded on this combination.
