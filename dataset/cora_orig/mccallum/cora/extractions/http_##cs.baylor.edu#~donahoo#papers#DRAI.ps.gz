Abstract: Current methodologies for information integration are inadequate for solving the problem of integration of large scale, distributed information sources (e.g. databases, free-form text, simulation etc). The existing approaches are either too restrictive and complicated as in the "federated" (global model) approach or do not provide the necessary functionality as in the "multidatabase" approach. We propose a hybrid approach combining the advantages of both the federated and multidatabase techniques which we believe provides the most feasible avenue for large scale integration. Under our architecture, the individual data site administrators provide an augmented export schema specifying knowledge about the sources of data (where data exists), their structure (underlying data model or file structure), their content (what data exists), and their relationships (how the data relates to other information in its domain). The augmented export schema from each information source provides an intelligent agent, called the "mediator," knowledge which can be used to infer information on some of the existing inter-system relationships. This knowledge can then be used to generate a partially integrated, global view of the data.

Reference-contexts: One major feature of the CANDIDE model is its ability to compute class-subclass relationships even among classes from dissimilar systems by subsumption from class relationship information [Sav91, She93, Wha93, Bra85]. Work with classification in the object-oriented model has produced similar results <ref> [Nav95, Are] </ref>. A variety of such systems supporting description logics are surveyed in [Bor94]. 3 Approach Our main objective is to build and demonstrate an intelligent interface to a set of (possibly autonomous) information sources including structured databases, knowledge bases, and unstructured data.

Reference-contexts: One possible method of dealing with this wide variety of information is to use Stanford's Object Exchange Model (OEM)[Pap94] which allows information exchange via self-described objects [Mar85] between different types of information sources. We propose to adapt the mediator paradigm <ref> [Pap94, Wei92, Wei93, Are94] </ref> to perform integration of the augmented export schemas. Integration of heterogeneous information sources requires a semantically rich data model. Earlier work has shown that the CANDIDE [Bec89, Nav91] model provides unique integration capabilities not found in traditional models.

Reference-contexts: While this approach is enticing, the complexity of constructing a global schema for large scale integration makes this approach infeasible because it requires an administrator who understands the semantics of all underlying systems and can resolve all inter-system schematic conflicts <ref> [Bat86] </ref>. In addition, the maintenance of a global schema in the face of addition/deletion of systems is difficult. A better approach to interoperability involves the combination of techniques of reasoning and learning with techniques of data modeling and access to provide a partially integrated, global view. <p> Batini et al. <ref> [Bat86] </ref> detail the problems of schema integration and provide a methodology for comparison of proposed solutions. Unlike many earlier integration efforts, we do not limit ourselves strictly to integration of databases. Instead, we focus on the integration of information sources including databases, free-form text, hypertext, etc.

Clearly, much more work needs to be done before any of the detailed functionality can be implemented.

Reference-contexts: To demonstrate this technology, we intend to augment the capabilities of both an autonomous (KRITIK2) and an interactive (Canah-Chab <ref> [Goe93] </ref>) device design system by providing a mediated interface between the design system and a collection of data/knowledge based systems (D/KBS). <p> To deal with this problem, the user needs feedback from the query processor in the form of a description of what information is/is not being considered and an explanation of why. Work in explanation is part of the Canah-Chab System <ref> [Goe93] </ref>. * Keyword searches should not be limited by the vocabulary of the query; instead, a thesaurus should be used to consider synonyms.

For example, identical application source code may reside in multiple locations; therefore, the system should attempt to provide object identity to facilitate replicated object identification. <p> Additionally, object versioning will allow the system to keep track of more recent versions of a retrieved object. A primitive form of object identification is supported in Stanford's OEM project <ref> [Pap94] </ref>. * External knowledge sources should be used to learn about objects in the system. For example, the query processor could inspect newsgroups or look at the manner in which objects are used in WWW to acquire knowledge about the objects and their relationships.
