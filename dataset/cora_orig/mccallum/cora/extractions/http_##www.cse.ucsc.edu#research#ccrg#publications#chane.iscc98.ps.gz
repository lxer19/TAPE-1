Title: Performance of Floor Acquisition Multiple Access in Ad-Hoc Networks  
Author: J.J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves and Chane L. Fullmer 
Abstract: The performance of the FAMA-NCS protocol in ad-hoc networks is analyzed. FAMA-NCS (for floor acquisition multiple access with non-persistent carrier sensing) guarantees that a single sender is able to send data packets free of collisions to a given receiver at any given time. FAMA-NCS is based on a three-way handshake between sender and receiver in which the sender uses non-persistent carrier sensing to transmit a request-to-send (RTS) and the receiver sends a clear-to-send (CTS) that lasts much longer than the RTS to serve as a busy tone that forces all hidden nodes to back off long enough to allow a collision-free data packet to arrive at the receiver. It is shown that that FAMA-NCS performs better than ALOHA, CSMA, and all prior proposals based on collision avoidance dialogues (e.g., MACA, MACAW, and IEEE 802.11 DFWMAC) in the presence of hidden terminals. Simulations experiments are used to confirm the analytical results.

Reference-contexts: Together with its transmission overhead, a 500-byte data packet then becomes about 25ms in length. This makes the ratio of RTS to data about 0.47, which severely degrades the performance of FAMA protocols <ref> [5] </ref>. Fig. 4. Throughput versus degree of node in ad-hoc network multihop networks versus the number of neighbors per node for the values of Q (0, N 2 and N 1). The analysis assumes a 1Mb/s wireless network with a diameter of 1 mile (propagation delay of about 6s).

Reference-contexts: (a) with hidden terminals, CSMA degrades to pure ALOHA; (b) implementing ALOHA with a single channel requires the use of acknowledgments to let the senders' of packets know if they need to retransmit; (c) implementing priority acknowledgment schemes (e.g., the schemes proposed for ALOHA and CSMA by Tobagi and Kleinrock <ref> [19] </ref>) do not work well with hidden terminals; and (d) slotted ALOHA has better performance than pure ALOHA. Figures 2 and 3 show the results of this comparison using the value of throughput derived in [19] for slotted ALOHA with acknowledgments. <p> priority acknowledgment schemes (e.g., the schemes proposed for ALOHA and CSMA by Tobagi and Kleinrock <ref> [19] </ref>) do not work well with hidden terminals; and (d) slotted ALOHA has better performance than pure ALOHA.
