Reference-contexts: Our interest in 0 ` is motivated by its connection with t noted in Lemma 2.2 below. See <ref> [1] </ref> for a survey of (fairly) recent progress in the theory of list-colouring and [14, 15] for some exciting, still more recent developments on, resp., edge- and list-colouring (and many more references than we give here!).

Reference-contexts: Of the many well-known relationships between the last three parameters, those needed for our purposes are the obvious + 1 (3) 0 : (4) Behzad <ref> [2] </ref> and Vizing [25] introduced independently a notion that is a "hybrid" of vertex-and edge-colouring.

Reference-contexts: Notation, terminology, simple bounds We shall assume the reader is familiar with standard graph theory terminology, as can be found, e.g., in <ref> [3] </ref> or [18]. Here we pause to fix notation and introduce a few ideas which may not be quite as familiar. In this paper, graph means simple graph, and colouring means proper colouring (in whichever context | vertex-, edge-, or alternate type of colouring | this term arises).

Reference-contexts: Fractional matters We turn now to the definition of fl t , the fractional analogue of t ; for this, it is natural first to formulate an integer programming problem defining t (see <ref> [4] </ref> or [22] for omitted LP/IP terminology). For a graph G and S V , let ffi (S) denote the set of edges of G with exactly one end in S.

Reference-contexts: Some of these (Theorems 2.1, 2.4) are needed as lemmas for our proofs in x3. Another graph colouring parameter introduced by Vizing [26] (and independently by Erd-os, Rubin and Taylor <ref> [5] </ref>) is the list-chromatic index, 0 ` .

Reference-contexts: For our purposes, i.e. for the first proof of Theorem 1.1, we need only the special case stated here.
