Reference-contexts: The problem addressed in this paper is motivated by the fact that it is convenient to restrict communication in a distributed system to a set of links defined by a spanning tree of the underlying network, particularly when the complexity of the routing scheme is a concern <ref> [1, 8, 4] </ref>. The use of multiple independent-spanning trees for data routing in networks provide a number of advantages, including increased fault-tolerance and bandwidth, when the connectivity of the underlying network permits such trees to be defined [5]. <p> For certain classes of graphs, for example n-wheel graphs, there exist edge-independent spanning trees with stretch factors of O (1); however, the construction given in [5] yields stretch factors that are (n), the worst possible. Stretch factors for routing schemes have been considered before in the work of <ref> [1] </ref>. But, to our knowledge, this paper is the first study of stretch factors for independent spanning trees. 1.2 Our Results The main contributions of this paper are linear-time algorithms for the construction of edge-independent and vertex-independent spanning trees with provable bounds on the stretch factors.

Reference-contexts: An analogous result holds for constructing vertex-independent spanning trees in 2-vertex-connected graphs. 2 Preliminaries A connected graph is 2-edge-connected (respectively, 2-vertex-connected ) if it has no cut edge (respectively, cut vertex). For undefined graph theoretic terminology we refer the reader to the standard reference by Bondy and Murty <ref> [2] </ref>. Let T be a spanning tree of G rooted at a vertex r 2 V (G). For every vertex v 2 V (G), let dist T (v; r) denote the distance from v to r in T . Similarly, define dist G (v; r).

Reference-contexts: Hence in the design of routing schemes for data networks, constructing multiple independent spanning trees with small stretch factors is an important issue. 1.1 Previous Work A number of papers have previously considered the existence and construction of independent spanning trees in graphs; see e.g., <ref> [10, 3, 6] </ref>. Itai and Rodeh [5] introduced the notion of a 2-tree protocol (for edges and vertices) for distributed networks. These are communication protocols that are resilient to a single (edge or vertex) failure.

By routing on both of these trees simultaneously, no single edge failure can prevent a message from reaching its intended destination. However, the work in <ref> [5] </ref> does not analyze the lengths of the paths in these spanning trees. For certain classes of graphs, for example n-wheel graphs, there exist edge-independent spanning trees with stretch factors of O (1); however, the construction given in [5] yields stretch factors that are (n), the worst possible. <p> However, the work in <ref> [5] </ref> does not analyze the lengths of the paths in these spanning trees.

Stretch factors for routing schemes have been considered before in the work of [1]. <p> Any path in T from v to root that does not use the hub must have length at least bn=2c. Since two vertex-disjoint tree paths from v to r cannot both use the hub, the proposition follows. 2 In <ref> [5] </ref> a method is given for constructing a pair of edge-independent spanning trees in a 2-edge-connected graph G based on concatenating the vertex-independent spanning trees of the 2-vertex-connected components of G. The previous proposition shows that in n-wheel graphs, trees defined in this way have stretch factors that are (n).
