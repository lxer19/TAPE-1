Abstract: In the last decade, we have seen an explosive growth in our capabilities to both collect and store data, and generate even more data by further computer processing. In fact, it is estimated that the amount of information in the world doubles every 20 months (Frawley, Piatetsky-Shapiro, & Matheus, 1991). Examples of this growth can be found in all sectors such as scientific, business and governmental organizations. Our inability to interpret and digest these data, as readily as they are accumulated, has created a need for a new generation of tools and techniques for automated and intelligent database analysis. Consequently, the discipline of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), which deals with the study of such tools and techniques, has evolved into an important and active area of research. KDD and other phrases, such as database mining, information harvesting or data mining, have been used to refer to the process of finding useful patterns (or nuggets of knowledge) in the raw data. As in any emerging field, there are differences of opinion as to what the definition and scope of KDD should be. In some literature, the phrase "knowledge discovery in databases" is viewed as a broader discipline, and the term data mining is seen as just the component dealing with knowledge discovery methods (Fayyad et al., 1996). Although the distinction is important and the terms are very clearly explained in that work, there is still a continuing tendency for researchers and practitioners to treat data mining and KDD as synonyms. To avoid any confusion, it is advisable to adopt phrases such as `data mining' or `KDD' to refer to the whole process in the path from data to knowledge and to use descriptive phrases for specific tasks in the process (e.g. pattern extraction methods, pattern evaluation methods, or data cleaning methods). In the next section, we define the several important terms and give a perspective that explains the goals of and motivation for research work on data mining. Following that we discuss the nature of database contents, along with problems and issues, that make the field of data mining unique and challenging. Then, we introduce individual articles that address some of these issues of data mining. Finally, we provide our conclusions.
