Abstract: A new model of DNA-based computation is presented. The main difference between this model and that of Adleman is in manipulation of DNA strands that are first immobilized on a surface. This approach greatly reduces losses of DNA molecules during purification steps. A simple, surface-based model of computation is described and it is shown how to implement an exhaustive search algorithm for the SAT problem on this model. Partial experimental progress in solving a 5-variable SAT instance is described, and possible extensions of our model that allow general computations are discussed.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Adleman <ref> [1] </ref> and subsequently Lipton [5] described how genetic engineering tools can be used to solve instances of NP-complete combinatorial problems. Their work has led to hopes of a DNA computer that can outperform the fastest realizable super computers at such problems. <p> Other suggested applications include massive associative memory [3] and problems in combinatorial chemistry, such as drug design [2]. Adleman solved a tiny instance of the Hamiltonian Path problem using a test tube-based methodology <ref> [1] </ref>. The chemical basis for solution of NP-complete problems is to represent the set of combinatorially possible solutions as a test tube of DNA strands (or oligonucleotides) and to selectively isolate the desired solutions from this set using hybridization, ligation, and other DNA manipulation processes.

Reference-contexts: ensures that the properly prepared oligos are immobilized to the surface at a high density, and that other oligos exposed to the surface later (for example, during hybridization) do not bind non-specifically to the surface. 3 We use a glass surface and an attachment chemistry developed in the Smith laboratory <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> Thus, the oligos to be marked are now double-stranded whereas those unmarked are single-stranded. Note that this method assumes that a single-base mismatch is sufficient to discriminate between marked and unmarked oligos. In previous studies <ref> [4] </ref> it was determined that excellent specificity and discrimination of single-base mismatches is obtained using 15mer sequences. <p> The 15mer sequence in the middle was chosen to match the length of the oligonucleotides employed in the Smith laboratory for mutation detection <ref> [4] </ref>. The 5 central nucleotides in the 15 mer hybridization sequence were synthesized as a combinatorial set with two possibilities at each position: (G+C)(G+C)(G+C)(A+T)(A+T), yielding 2 5 = 32 distinct products in the mixture. <p> A or T roughly equal to those encoded as G or C, the GC content is kept constant at about 50%. 4.2 Implementation of Operations We next describe three studies that test the mark and destroy-unmarked operations defined above. 4.2.1 Marking by Hybridization In this experiment, we followed previous work <ref> [4] </ref> which successfully achieved single-base mismatch discrimination in hybridization. We note that ultimately we will have do this experiment with the full solution space (32-mixture of molecules) on the surface, but for testing purposes we are currently using just two different molecules on the surface. <p> We have some evidence that (i) is a problem, since fluorescence is still detected after washing with water (which should break the hydrogen bonds of double-stranded DNA). In <ref> [4] </ref>, bad discrimination was not a problem, but in their experiment, only a single fluorescently tagged DNA strand, rather than a mixture, was introduced to hybridize to the DNA strand immobilized on the surface. <p> The scale of computation is severely restricted by the 2-dimensional nature of surface-based computation. With the surfaces currently used, if each DNA molecule occupies an area of 20 angstroms by 20 angstroms, or 400 square angstroms (this is the density found to be optimum in our previous work, <ref> [4] </ref>), then a 1 cm area can accommodate only 2 fi 10 13 molecules.

Reference-contexts: This method greatly reduces losses of DNA molecules during purification steps. We note that surface-based chemistries have become the standard for complex chemical syntheses such as solid-phase protein synthesis, solid-phase DNA synthesis, solid-phase protein sequence analysis, and many other chemistries <ref> [6] </ref>. The power of this method was also recognized by Adleman in his use of magnetic support particles in the Hamiltonian path experiment, although his approach did not fully exploit the utility of the support-based approach. In this paper, we describe a "bare-bones" surface-based model for DNA computation.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, Exonuclease I acts specifically on single-stranded DNA, degrading it processively in the 3 0 ! 5 0 direction, thus producing 5 0 mononucleotides and leaving the terminal 5 0 dinucleotide intact <ref> [7] </ref>. 6 In our experiments, we found that Exonuclease I could easily destroy single strands in solution without any added proteins or surfactants.
