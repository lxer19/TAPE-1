Abstract: Future computing environments will free the user from the constraints of the desktop. Applications for a mobile environment should take advantage of contextual information, such as position, to offer greater services to the user. In this paper, we present the Cyberguide project, in which we are building prototypes of a mobile context-aware tour guide. Knowledge of the user's current location, as well as a history of past locations, are used to provide more of the kind of services that we come to expect from a real tour guide. We describe the architecture and features of a variety of Cyberguide prototypes developed for indoor and outdoor use on a number of different hand-held platforms. We also discuss the general research issues that have emerged in our context-aware applications development in a mobile environment.

Reference-contexts: Another major theme the FCE group has worked on involves automated capture of user experience to facilitate later access to a rich record of that experience. Most of our work in that area has involved the application of ubiquitous computing technology in the stationary environment of the university classroom <ref> [12, 1, 2] </ref> and others have applied it in the meeting room environment [9, 10] . We can see a hint of this capture/access problem appearing in CyBARguide as the traveller records impressions of an establishment that may influence their plans later on.

Reference-contexts: We designed an application level protocol on top of a public domain implementation of the Appletalk protocol for Solaris <ref> [4] </ref>. This allows us to open a connection-based Appletalk stream from the Apple MessagePad to a UNIX platform. We then invoked our gateway application to repacketize Appletalk packets into TCP/IP packets for transmission over the Internet. This allowed for TCP/IP connectivity from a Apple MessagePad via an Appletalk connection.

Reference-contexts: handle more of the user's context, such as where she and others have been, and we have increased the amount in which the tourist can interact and communicate with the place and people she is visiting. 1.1 Overview This paper is an extended version of an earlier report on Cyberguide <ref> [7] </ref>, we discuss the evolution of the Cyberguide design and prototype as well as what future research areas our experience has uncovered. We begin in Section 2 by describing scenarios for the use of context-aware mobile applications. <p> We have investigated many of these possibilities already and report on them later. 3 Related Work In thinking about and developing a location-aware application, we were greatly influenced by work such as the PARCTab at Xerox PARC [14], the InfoPad project at Berkeley <ref> [7] </ref>, the Olivetti Active Badge system [14] and the Personal Shopping Assistant proposed at AT&T [3].

Reference-contexts: Current use of mobile technology shows a slow evolution from our current desktop paradigm of computing, but the history of interaction shows that the adoption of new technology usually brings about a radical revolution in the way humans use and view technology <ref> [11] </ref>. Whereas the effective use of mobile technology will give rise to an interaction paradigm shift, it is difficult to predict what that shift will be. We follow the advice of Alan Kay, therefore, and choose to predict the future by inventing it.

Reference-contexts: We tried to pay attention to the higher level conceptual design of Cyberguide, but we have not been as general in our handling of context-aware mobile objects as has Schilit <ref> [13] </ref>. 4 Architecture of Cyberguide From the beginning, we have viewed Cyberguide as a family of prototypes and not just a single prototype, so it made sense to think about a conceptual design, or architecture, that captured the essence of the mobile tour guide.
