Abstract: Due in large part to early development of the Mosaic WWW browser by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), the access load on the NCSA WWW server remains extremely high. Using the NCSA WWW server as a high load testbed, we describe Avatar, a virtual reality system for real-time analysis and mapping of WWW server accesses to their point of geographic origin on various projections of the Earth. As HTTP protocols expand to demographic data, the Avatar architecture can be extended to correlate this data as well.

Reference-contexts: User WWW access patterns and demographics have been analyzed by a large group of researchers (e.g., Pitkow et al [14]). Likewise, there a many studies of server behavior and caching strategies (e.g.,Abrams et al <ref> [1] </ref>) The focus of our work is on understanding short-term trends and geographic display. 8 Conclusions Given the rapid growth of WWW traffic and the emerging use of the WWW for commercial use, studying access patterns is an important first step in understanding network implications and in designing future generations of

Reference-contexts: Second, this isolation simplifies extension of the analysis software or its replacement with an alternate analysis system (e.g., a relational database of access pattern, performance, and demographic data). The only medium of data exchange between virtual environment and the analysis system is the Pablo self-describing data format <ref> [2] </ref>, an extensible data meta-format with embedded data descriptions.

Reference-contexts: On the globe or its projection, data can be displayed either as arcs between source and destination or as stacked bars. The former can be used to display point-to-point communication traffic <ref> [3] </ref>, with the thickness, height, and color of the arc representing specific data attributes. Stacked bars convey information through three mechanisms: position, height, and color bands. For WWW traffic, each bar is placed at the geographic origin of a WWW request. <p> the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois. 6 SDDFA #1: "Mosaic_Metric" - int "time"; int "server"; int "size"; int "file_type"; int "domain_type"; float "latitude"; float "longitude"; char "city"[]; char "state"[]; char "country"[]; char "hostname"[]; -;; "Mosaic_Metric" - 1300, 1, 12000, 2, 3, 40.112, -88.200, [6] ``URBANA'', [2] ``IL'', <ref> [3] </ref> ``USA'', [8] ``www-pablo.cs.uiuc.edu'' -;; possible record instance associated with this descriptor definition.

We also thank Thomas Kwan for his work on the data retrieval system.

Reference-contexts: The SDDF allows Avatar to interop-erate with performance instrumentation and analysis tools. The packaged SDDF records are sent via UDP sockets to the Avatar virtual reality software. Avatar then renders the data in the NCSA CAVE <ref> [7] </ref>, an unencumbered environment for immersive data analysis. In the following section, we describe the data immersion software in detail. 4 Avatar Virtual Reality System Avatar is a virtual reality framework, built on the Pablo performance analysis toolkit [15], that supports multiple metaphors to display dynamic data [17, 16].

Reference-contexts: To meet the increasing demand, NCSA adopted a scalable approach to server design <ref> [9] </ref> capable of satisfying large numbers of requests for small documents. As a portion of Figure 1 shows, the scalable server consists of a set of dedicated HP 735 workstations that service WWW requests.
