Abstract: Negotiation, an interactive communication among participants to resolve conflicts, has been often adopted in multiagent systems to coordinate agents behavior. However, most of the negotiation models in multiagent systems are domain-dependent and do not support the complex strategic interactions such as elaborate argumentation. The theme of our research is to design a unified framework to model the negotiation process. Rather than developing a specific model for each application, we build a generic framework which can support a variety of negotiation situations. Our framework is defined in terms of three constituents: the negotiating agent model, the negotiation language, and the negotiation protocol. The negotiating agent maintains mental states and reasons about them. Depending on the application and the complexity required, one can model different agents based on the abstract agent model we propose to represent the wide variety of agenthood. The negotiation language consists of the performatives and the content information, and its semantics is defined by the mental states of the speaker and the hearer and the changes of them. The negotiation protocol governs the interaction among agents by constraining the way the participants communicate. While the language gives an unambiguous definition of the performatives, the protocol defines their appropriate use. Though primitive, the new negotiation framework shows its strengths in both theoretical and practical areas. In practice, the agent model is flexible enough to support a variety of agenthood and the negotiation language and mechanism are expressive enough to cover the wide range of applications. In theory, negotiation can be unifiedly explained in the viewpoint of the three components of our framework.

Reference-contexts: First, it can be viewed as a counterproposal with NULL content. Secondly, a reject message may mean the firm rejection in which the speaker has no interest in further negotiation. Once again, how to interpret them is under the hearers control. Retract [14] and <ref> [1] </ref> report the need for retract of previously accepted proposal. It may result from that the agent cannot perform the agreed task anymore because of a failure.

Reference-contexts: It may include voting schemes, auctions, competitive bids, final-offer arbitration, simultaneous-offer (possibly with adjustments), fair-division schemes, divide-and-choose, and so on. 6 An example: Negotiation in A C D S In this example, our negotiation framework is used to explain an existing multiagent system, called Autonomous Configuration-Design Service (ACDS) <ref> [4] </ref>. ACDS automatically designs a multicomponent product which satisfies all the required constraints in a distributed way. ACDS is chosen for two reasons. First, it has a well-defined description language for the object of negotiation, which can serve as a content language.

Reference-contexts: Our framework is defined in terms of three constituents: the negotiating agent model, the negotiation language, and the negotiation protocol. By dividing negotiation into three components, we can model the behavior of various agents in different situations - for example, cooperative agents in Contract Net <ref> [5] </ref> and perfectly-competitive agents in auction. It also helps us to understand the properties of current existing negotiation systems. The remainder of the paper is organized into five sections. Section 2 is an overview of the negotiation framework.

Reference-contexts: Second, a generic negotiation language is developedit has few restrictions and can be extended and applied to virtually any situation. The negotiation language is structured based on the speech act theory. Its syntax is similar to that of KQML <ref> [6] </ref>: it consists of the basic primitives (performatives) and the content information. One unique characteristic of the new language is that the semantics of the primitives is defined by the mental states of the speaker and the hearer and the changes of them. <p> Note that, although performatives are extensible, the choice of performatives directly affects the content language. For example, if we commit to a restricted set of performatives, more information should be carried at the content language layer <ref> [6] </ref>. 4 . 2 . 1 Negotiation performatives The performatives are divided into two classes: negotiation performatives and information performatives.

Reference-contexts: We do not support the various degree of uncertain beliefs at present. Konolige <ref> [9] </ref> suggested that the uncertainty could be introduced if the representation of facts contains statements about uncertainty: e.g., statements such as that j is true with the probability 1/2. If we follow the strict definition of modal theory 2 , hardly any information can become knowledge except mathematical theorems. <p> The operator K can be omitted if the subject of knowledge j is the agent himself or everyone (common knowledge). However, that agent A believes that agent B knows j should be represented as Bel A K B j to avoid confusion. Konolige <ref> [9] </ref> developed the deduction model as a model of beliefs (information attitudes in our definition). Given a set of base beliefs, a deductive model of belief can derive some of the logical consequences of this set (not necessarily all of the consequences) using set of inference rules.

Reference-contexts: Third, in designing a new language, we do not attempt to use the full range of speech acts. McCarthy made an insightful observation in <ref> [11] </ref>. The full use of speech acts requires intelligence on the human level. ... [H]uman-level intelligence is still an unknown distance ahead of us. Therefore, it is important to analyze the proposed uses of speech acts and decide how much intelligence is required for each use.

Reference-contexts: The typical knowledge information includes the capability information of an agent (CAN in AOP <ref> [13] </ref>), the domain knowledge (ontology), and common sense. Bel i j The operator Bel i t denotes a belief an agent i has at time t. An agent can model both the physical world and the cognitive states of other agents. <p> Ack This message indicates that a previous message from the listener has been received. Note that this does not mean that the speaker accepts the proposal. Accept The agent accepts the plan. This changes the plan into the goal which implies the commitment. Differ from <ref> [13] </ref>, the obligation is implicit in the goal. So by accepting the proposal, an agent is committed himself to the proposed plan. Reject The speaker rejects the plan. The reject message may be interpreted in two different meanings. First, it can be viewed as a counterproposal with NULL content.

Reference-contexts: Before introducing the new language, we list in this section some observations about the differences between artificial and natural language which are relevant in designing an artificial language. First, the artificial language needs an explicit acknowledgment <ref> [14] </ref>. Compared to faceto-face human dialogue which can utilize visual aids (nodding, facial expressions) or body language (gesture), the artificial language lacks nonverbal means of communication. <p> Due to the space limitation, we only list the formal semantics of the performative propose in this paper. Propose The speaker proposes to the hearer a plan j to achieve. Differ from <ref> [14] </ref>, we do not distinguish ProposeForAccept from ProposeAct. ProposeForAccept is to deliver the information while ProposeAct is to communicate the plan such that the former is the same as the information performative tell, while the latter is what we call propose. <p> First, it can be viewed as a counterproposal with NULL content. Secondly, a reject message may mean the firm rejection in which the speaker has no interest in further negotiation. Once again, how to interpret them is under the hearers control. Retract <ref> [14] </ref> and [1] report the need for retract of previously accepted proposal. It may result from that the agent cannot perform the agreed task anymore because of a failure.

Reference-contexts: One objection may be that the effect on the hearer is the perlocutionary effect and that the perlocutionary effect is subject to the idiosyncrasies of individual understanding which cannot be represented as the meaning of the language. However, similar to <ref> [16] </ref>, we believe the semantics of the protocol can be described by the ideal, minimal effect on the mental state of the conversants. <p> The meaning of propose indicates the purpose of the utterance in the ideal situations 4 which is described in terms of the two models: the speakers and the hearers model. 3 In his paper <ref> [16] </ref>, Werner explains the directive is to deliver the actions (intentions) and the informative is to deliver the events (information).

Reference-contexts: In addition to the mental state and operation dichotomy, the mental states of an agent are subdivided into two categories: information attitudes and pro-attitudes following Wooldridge <ref> [17] </ref>. [I]nformation attitudes are related to the information that an agent has about the world it occupies, whereas pro-attitudes are those that in some way guide the agents actions. Precisely which combination of attitudes is most appropriate to characterize an agent is ... an issue of some debate.
