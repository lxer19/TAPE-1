Abstract: We describe a method for shape-based image database search that uses deformable prototypes to represent categories. Rather than directly comparing a candidate shape with all shape entries in the database, shapes are compared in terms of the types of nonrigid deformations (differences) that relate them to a small subset of representative prototypes. To solve the shape correspondence and alignment problem, we employ the technique of modal matching, an information-preserving shape decomposition for matching, describing, and comparing shapes despite sensor variations and nonrigid deformations. In modal matching, shape is decomposed into an ordered basis of orthogonal principal components. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for shape comparison in 2-D image databases.

Reference-contexts: First, we are interested not only in recognizing shapes, but also in describing the types of deformations that relate them. We want to derive a low-dimensional parametric representation of the shape that can be used to recognize and compare shapes, in the manner of Dar-rell and Pentland <ref> [12] </ref>. Second, we cannot be restricted to a linear framework. Nonrigid motions are inherently nonlinear, although they are often physically smooth.

Modal matching also provides this invariance to size and orientation, but unlike any of the shape representations used in QBIC, modal representations can also be made invariant to affine deformations, and thus selectively invariant to changes in camera viewpoint.

Another system, proposed by Chen [9] identified 2-D aircraft shapes using elliptic Fourier descriptors. Because it is Fourier descriptor-based, Chen's system suffers from problems with sampling and parameterization.

Reference-contexts: More importantly, the modal representation provides deformation control knobs that correspond qualitatively with human's notions of perceptual shape similarity <ref> [4; 41] </ref>. Shape is thought of in terms of an ordered set of deformations from an initial shape: starting with bends, tapers, shears, and moving up towards higher-frequency shape variations. 5.2 Speed of Image Database Search Another concern in image database search is the computation speed.

Reference-contexts: Rather than discarding useful similarity information by employing only invariants, we believe that one should use a decomposition that preserves as much semantically meaningful and perceptually important information as is possible, while still providing an efficient encoding of the original signal <ref> [42] </ref>. Another important problem with these approaches is that most are only robust for rigid shapes. Although many things move rigidly, in many cases this rigid-body model is inadequate. For instance, most biological objects are flexible and articulated. <p> Such shapes are simply flagged as being not at all similar to a particular shape prototype, as described in Section 3.4. The resulting modal strain energy was then used as a similarity metric in Photobook, an image database management system developed at the MIT Media Lab <ref> [42] </ref>. Using Photobook, the user selected the image at the upper left, and the system retrieved the remaining images sorted by strain energy (shape similarity) from left to right, top to bottom. The similarity measure is shown below each image.

Given this equilibrium solution in the two images, point correspondences can be obtained directly. By discarding high frequency modes the amount of computation required can be minimized without significantly altering correspondence accuracy. <p> Moreover, such a set of modal amplitudes provides a robust, canonical description of shape in terms of deformations applied to the original elastic body. This allows them to be used directly for object recognition <ref> [43] </ref>. 2.3 Modal Matching Perhaps the major limitation of previous methods is the requirement that every object be described as the deformations of a single prototype object. For instance, in some schemes all shapes are represented as deformations from an elliptical or circular prototype [9; 20; 43]. <p> For instance, in some schemes all shapes are represented as deformations from an elliptical or circular prototype <ref> [9; 20; 43] </ref>. Such approaches implicitly impose an a priori parameterization upon the sensor data, and therefore implicitly determine the correspondences between data and prototype. Furthermore, an elliptical prototype may be inadequate for many shapes, especially shapes that are not star-connected, or those that have long protrusions or deep concavities.

However, as noted by Faloutsos, et al. [20], systems that offer a list of items sorted by similarity do not fall under the rubric of exact matching.
