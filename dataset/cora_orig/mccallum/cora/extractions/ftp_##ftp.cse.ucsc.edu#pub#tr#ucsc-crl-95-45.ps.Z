Abstract: The key to the method of measured equation of invariance (MEI) is the postulate: "the MEI is independent of the excitation". The word "postulate" certainly just means a guess without rigorous proof. In the report, we theoretically prove that the MEI is independent of the excitation on the restriction of O(h 2 ), here h is the discretization step. The error between the accurate solution and the solution of the MEI is shown. Besides, we show that the "metrons" are indeed not basis functions with substantial illustrations.
