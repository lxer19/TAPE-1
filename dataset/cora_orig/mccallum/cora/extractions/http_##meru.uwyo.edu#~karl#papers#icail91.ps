Title: Reasoning with Portions of Precedents  
Author: L. Karl Branting

Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Wyoming Laramie, Wyoming  
Abstract: This paper argues that the task of matching in case-based reasoning can often be improved by comparing new cases to portions of precedents. An example is presented that illustrates how combining portions of multiple precedents can permit new cases to be resolved that would be indeterminate if new cases could only be compared to entire precedents. A system that uses of portions of precedents for legal analysis in the domain of Texas worker's compensation law, GREBE, is described, and examples of GREBE's analysis that combine reasoning steps from multiple precedents are presented.

Reference-contexts: In this approach, a predicate is satisfied by a new case if the set of transformations that includes both the exemplars of the predicate and the new case is more coherent than the set of transformations that excludes the new case. A third approach, dimensional analysis <ref> (Ashley, 1988) </ref>, uses knowledge of the factors that tend to establish or negate a predicate and the magnitude of these factors in precedents and new cases.

Reference-contexts: Goodhart's theory has been criticized on the grounds that judges often fail to make explicit the facts that they consider to be material to their decisions <ref> (Bodenheimer, 1974) </ref>. Goodhart advocated looking to "the reasons given by the judge in his opinion, or his statement of the rule of law he is following : : : " as a guide to determining the material facts.

Reference-contexts: Precedent constituents are a particular form of case "snippets" (Red-mond, 1990; Kolodner, 1988), individual inferences appearing in a precedent. Precedent constituents were termed exemplar-based explanations in <ref> (Branting, 1989) </ref>. Prec. Class.

Reference-contexts: from a priori domain theory (such as the rule that battery requires an intentional touching and no consent). 3 Precedent Constituents in GREBE GREBE (GeneratoR of Exemplar-Based Explanations) is a system for legal analysis in the domain of Texas worker's compensation law that is able to reason with precedent constituents <ref> (Branting, 1991) </ref>. The top-level components of GREBE consist of an explanation generator, a memorandum generator, and a knowledge base of rules and cases.

Reference-contexts: Thus, only a part of the reasoning of Janak was relevant to each of these subsequent cases. The model implemented in GREBE of precedents as warrants connecting the material facts of the case to an abstract predicate is consistent with the theory of ratio decidendi advocated by Arthur Goodhart <ref> (Goodhart, 1930) </ref>. Goodhart argued that the authoritative portions of a precedent consist of "the material facts as seen by the judge and his conclusion based on them : : : " (Goodhart, 1959).

Reference-contexts: Similarly, differing case features can be matched if both are manifestations of the same abstract feature, e.g., if both are symptoms caused by the same underlying physiological state or both have the same generalization. 2 Protos (Porter et al., 1990) and Casey <ref> (Koton, 1988) </ref> used case elaboration to improve match accuracy. A second form of case-matching inference is term reformulation, the process of replacing an 2 Case elaboration was termed knowledge-based pattern matching in (Porter et al., 1990).

Reference-contexts: The classification of the precedent with the highest overall match strength is then applied to the new case (Stanfill and Waltz, 1986; Salzberg, 1988; Brad-shaw, 1987). A second approach is the "prototype-plus-deformation" model described in <ref> (McCarty and Sridharan, 1982) </ref>. In this approach, a predicate is satisfied by a new case if the set of transformations that includes both the exemplars of the predicate and the new case is more coherent than the set of transformations that excludes the new case.

Reference-contexts: Such legal predicates are said to be "open-textured." Open texture in legal predicates is an instance of the broader phenomenon of category polymorphy <ref> (Rosch and Mervis, 1975) </ref>, the absence of precise conditions for category membership. Open-textured legal predicates are typically highly abstract terms occurring in the antecedents of legal rules.
