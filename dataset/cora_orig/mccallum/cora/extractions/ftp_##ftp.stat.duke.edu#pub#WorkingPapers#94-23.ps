Abstract: Hierarchically structured mixture models are studied in the context of data analysis and inference on neural synaptic transmission characteristics in mammalian, and other, central nervous systems. Mixture structures arise due to uncertainties about the stochastic mechanisms governing the responses to electro-chemical stimulation of individual neuro-transmitter release sites at nerve junctions. Models attempt to capture scientific features such as the sensitivity of individual synaptic transmission sites to electro-chemical stimuli, and the extent of their electro-chemical responses when stimulated. This is done via suitably structured classes of prior distributions for parameters describing these features. Such priors may be structured to permit assessment of currently topical scientific hypotheses about fundamental neural function. Posterior analysis is implemented via stochastic simulation. Several data analyses are described to illustrate the approach, with resulting neurophysiological insights in some recently generated experimental contexts. Further developments and open questions, both neurophysiological and statistical, are noted. Research partially supported by the NSF under grants DMS-9024793, DMS-9305699 and DMS-9304250.

Reference-contexts: It is certainly desirable to investigate variations on the basic Gibbs sampling schemes that enhance and improve convergence characteristics. It is possible that hybrid schemes based, in part, on the use of auxiliary variables <ref> (e.g., Besag and Green, 1993) </ref> will prove useful here; the need for improved computational tools will be more strongly felt in more complex models incorporating non-normal noise components.

The specific collection and sequence of conditional posterior distributions used to develop simulation algorithms are described in some mathematical detail in Appendix B, and briefly summarised here.

A paired-pulse experiment is designed to investigate changes or adaptations in the neural response characteristics at a single synaptic junction due to previous potentiation <ref> (e.g., Kullman and Nicoll 1992) </ref>. In this case, the tissue is stimulated, as usual, to generate the first EPSP data set, both noise and signal recordings; this is EPSP B1 in the Figure. Then, following potentiation, the experiment is rapidly repeated, generating EPSP B2 in this case. <p> Inference about differences in release levels, and in the stochastic nature of neurotransmitter release more generally, are relevant to physiological theories of adaptation and evolution of nervous systems, and of particular interest in connection with growth (or deterioration) in function in mammalian nervous systems and brains <ref> (Kullman and Nicoll 1992) </ref>. So it is of interest here to compare inferences made for the two cases, asking questions about how the stochastic mechanisms governing transmission may have changed between the two cases as a result of recent potentiation. <p> First, the site release probabilities are still constant across sites, but have increased to around 0:14 0:16 or higher, perhaps a doubling of the common release probability in the first pulse. This ties in with a leading hypothesis about the physiological effects of potentiation <ref> (e.g., Kullman and Nicoll 1992) </ref>, that, following potentiation, release sites are in a state of more immediate readiness to transmit, and will therefore be more likely to do so at the rapid repeat stimulation in a paired pulse experiment.

Reference-contexts: The same applies to the j : Notice that we retain the original, unidentified parametrisation for model specification and the simulation analysis operates on the unconstrained posteriors. This has a theoretical benefit in allowing easy and direct application of standard convergence results <ref> (Tierney 1994) </ref>. More practically, it has been our experience that imposing an identifying ordering on parameters directly through the prior distribution hinders convergence of the resulting MCMC on the constrained parameter space.

Reference-contexts: Current neurophysiological experimentation enables the isolation of rather small areas of nerve tissue on large nerve cells in mammalian central nervous systems, and in which synaptic connections consist of very small (though uncertain) numbers of transmission sites <ref> (Turner and Schlieckert 1990) </ref>. Electro-chemical techniques are used to stimulate nerve tissue to induce neurotransmitter release across identified synapses.

Reference-contexts: occasion, require a waiting period in order to transmit again to similar maximum levels, i.e., a period of replenishment. 6 ADDITIONAL VARIANCE COMPONENTS AND A MODEL EXTENSION Recent attention has focussed on questions of additional variability in EPSP outcomes due to so-called intrinsic variability in release levels of individual synapses <ref> (Turner et al 1995) </ref>; we describe this concept here, and define an elaborated class of models incorporating it. This concept gives rise to model modifications in which components of the normal mixture representation have variances that increase with level, and this leads to considerable complications, both substantive and technical.
