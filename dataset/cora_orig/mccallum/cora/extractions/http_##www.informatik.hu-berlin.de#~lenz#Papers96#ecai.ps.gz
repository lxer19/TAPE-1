Title: Lazy Propagation in Case Retrieval Nets  
Author: Mario Lenz and Hans-Dieter Burkhard 
Abstract: An efficient retrieval of a relatively small number of relevant cases from a huge case base is a crucial subtask of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). In this article, we investigate Case Retrieval Nets, a memory model for this task which is applicable in any domain with attribute-based case representations. The main idea is to apply a restricted spreading activation process in the case memory in order to retrieve the cases most similar to a posed query case.

Reference-contexts: The TRAVEL AGENCY case base has been included in this article for two reasons: Firstly, it has been used for comparative analyses in a number of previous publications (e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>). Secondly, the similarity metric employed is more knowledge intensive than for the other data sets. Hence, there is a large number of similarity links as described in the CRN model. The data sets b) to d) have been taken from the Repository of Machine Learning and Domain Theories ([10]).

Reference-contexts: In order to increase efficiency, these techniques either limit the flexibility of case retrieval or require a large amount of structured world knowledge. In <ref> [4, 5, 9] </ref> we developed Case Retrieval Nets (CRN) as a memory model for an efficient and flexible case retrieval. Major parts of the memory structures automatically arise from the case descriptions; existing background knowledge may be integrated into the net structures (e.g. as similarity links).

Reference-contexts: For the TRAVEL AGENCY domain, we compared the retrieval time in CRNs with the time required for linear search. Using, e.g., <ref> [6] </ref>, this allows for a comparison with other techniques. Figure 4 displays the results from posing a number of different queries to an implementation of CRNs integrated into the CABATA system ([7]).

Reference-contexts: All four data sets vary concerning size, type of attributes used and other properties, no data set contained missing values. More details on the data sets as well as on the tests can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. We performed a number of case retrievals and measured the CPU time required.
