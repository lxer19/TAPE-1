Abstract: We present a concept-based approach to the problem of lexical selection which allows us to deal precisely with lexicalization gaps or mismatches in mapping from a source language into a target language. We adopt a linguistically motivated scheme that makes use of a decompositional representation which can be classified in terms of a KR ontology. A main contribution of our representation scheme is the ability to handle cases where two concepts overlap, but neither subsumes the other. We have demonstrated the utility of our approach for mismatched verbs in English and German.

Reference-contexts: We feel that 1 Intra-concept constituents are stored within the concept roles and are constrained by well-formedness conditions. 2 We use the term "decompositionality" to mean the representation of concepts as combinations of atomic units of meaning. 3 Barnett, Mani, and Rich <ref> [ Barnett et al., 1994, p. 363 ] </ref> suggest a similar use of a term classifier. the proposed architecture not only meets this original goal, but is a decisive foundation for increasing the expressive power of the lexical semantic representation and hence the precision of the surface realization. <p> The mismatch problem in MT has received increasingly greater attention in recent literature (see [ Dorr, 1994 ] , [ Dorr and Voss, 1993 ] , <ref> [ Barnett et al., 1994 ] </ref> , [ Beaven, 1992 ] , [ Kameyama et al., 1991 ] , [ Kinoshita et al., 1992 ] , [ Lindop and Tsujii, 1991 ] , and [ Whitelock, 1992 ] as well as related discussion in [ Melby, 1986 ] and [ Nirenburg <p> Beaven, 1992 ] , [ Kameyama et al., 1991 ] , [ Kinoshita et al., 1992 ] , [ Lindop and Tsujii, 1991 ] , and [ Whitelock, 1992 ] as well as related discussion in [ Melby, 1986 ] and [ Nirenburg and Nirenburg, 1988 ] .) In particular, <ref> [ Barnett et al., 1994 ] </ref> divide distinctions between the source language and the target language into two cate gories: translation divergences, in which the same infor-mation is conveyed in the source and target texts, but the structures of the sentences are different (as in previous work by [ Dorr, 1994 <p> Researchers investigating divergences (see, e.g., [ Dorr and Voss, 1993 ] ) are more inclined to address the mechanism that links the IL representation to the syntactic structure of the target language, whereas investigators of the mismatch problem (see, e.g., <ref> [ Barnett et al., 1994 ] </ref> , [ Kameyama et al., 1991 ] ) are more inclined to focus on the details of the conceptual representation underlying the IL. <p> From this it follows that, when an exact TL word match is missing (a gap), there are three possible relations between the closest TL word and the SL word: subsumes, subsumed-by, and overlapping. 12 These three lexical/ontological mismatches span the possible cases of meaning mismatch <ref> [ Barnett et al., 1994 ] </ref> . Here we will briefly give an example of each of these for translations from English into German. In Figure 1 in the RHS column, we can see first that the non-causative English verb bus has no German lexical equivalent.

Reference-contexts: In the gato case, the markedness ambiguity is stored in the SL lexicon and so can be passed along during translation starting 8 The marked/unmarked distinction is originally from phonology and later was extended into syntax, semantics and learnability theory <ref> [ Bolinger, 1975 ] </ref> . 9 Markedness ambiguity is not language-specific. The English word goose, for example, is also ambiguous.
