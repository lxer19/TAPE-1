Reference-contexts: Other definitions of source addressing this issue are explored in <ref> [AS] </ref>. 2 Definitions A probabilistic machine is a Turing machine with a usual input tape and another one-way, read-only input tape, called the random tape, each cell of which contains a 0 or a 1. For each input x and each sequence S on the random tape the machine halts. <p> The concept of resource-bounded measure on exponential and larger time and space classes was introduced by Lutz, and we refer the reader to [L92] for relevant definitions. Extending the concept of measure downward to PSPACE or P involves some subtleties, and is accomplished in [M2] and <ref> [AS] </ref>. We will use the notation of [AS], which is convenient for talking about several different kinds of measure. <p> Extending the concept of measure downward to PSPACE or P involves some subtleties, and is accomplished in [M2] and <ref> [AS] </ref>.

A (PSPACE) machine works in polylogspace, has the allowable space marked off on its worktape, and reads its input once, from left to right. A measure on P was defined in [AS] by writing P as the result of (P) constructors, where a (P) machine M works in polylog time, is given the length of its input, and, for each integer n; there's a polylog-sized dependency set G M;n ; such that for each w of length n and each i 2 <p> We now show that almost every PSPACE sequence is normal (in the sense of measure in [M]), thereby concluding that almost every PSPACE sequence is a source. We also show it is not the case that almost every P sequence is normal (in the sense of measure in <ref> [AS] </ref>). First, we cover the abnormal sequences in PSPACE. The strategy is to cover the set of abnormal sequences by writing this as a (PSPACE)-union of more manageable pieces. <p> In a sense, a (P) machine looks only at o (n) of its input, and normality is a condition on all but o (n) of the bits [Ch]. The proof is straightforward given the discussion in <ref> [AS] </ref> about a similar theorem. Theorem 15 Let X be the set of abnormal (respectively normal) numbers. For the measure (P) ( j P) of [AS], we have (P) (X j P) 6= 0: Proof. <p> The proof is straightforward given the discussion in <ref> [AS] </ref> about a similar theorem. Theorem 15 Let X be the set of abnormal (respectively normal) numbers. For the measure (P) ( j P) of [AS], we have (P) (X j P) 6= 0: Proof. Suppose we are given a (P) null density-system d; we construct a characteristic sequence w for an abnormal (normal) language P. We will assume d is its own computation; the general case is similar. <p> Since we follow a path of non-increasing d whenever d queries its input, the language accepted is not covered by d (the conclusion makes use of the "non-increasing" property in <ref> [AS] </ref>). <p> We consider this is a drawback in the definition of source. Intuitively, we feel that a notion of source should make the complexity of a source at least the complexity of the languages decidable using the source. <ref> [AS] </ref> explores other possible notions of source.

Reference-contexts: While this sequence is easy to describe, we have no proof that it's in AC 0 : Moreover, a straightforward way of computing it requires division by small numbers, and division by 3 is known not to be in AC 0 (see <ref> [BL] </ref>). Thus we use a variant, S 0 ; computed by the program in figure 1, and shown in part in figure 2.

Reference-contexts: We show that if a sequence is known to be a source for the constant-time bounded-error machines, then it will be a source for arbitrary bounded-error machines, since these sequences are exactly the classical normal sequences (or normal numbers) of <ref> [Bor] </ref>. The condition of normality proves easier to work with than the condition of being a source, and in this way we are able to improve the arguments of [L90], showing that almost all sequences in PSPACE are sources. A third intuitive property of sources is hardness. <p> Normal sequences were first mentioned by Borel, and discussed in <ref> [Bor] </ref>, where it is noted that all reals except on a set of measure zero are normal numbers, i.e., have binary expansions which are normal in the scale of 2. <p> * The sequence S is a source for B 0 : * The sequence S is normal. 4 Abundance of Normal Numbers It is easily shown that (in the sense of Lebesgue measure) almost every real number between 0 and 1 is normal, i.e., has a normal binary expansion (see <ref> [Bor] </ref>; the fact also follows from - 9 - a proof that almost every number is normal in a resource bounded sense). Lutz has shown [L90] that almost every E 2 SPACE sequence is a source for B, (in the sense of measure defined there).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In <ref> [L90] </ref>, Lutz examines a particular kind of pseudorandomness useful for simulating the bounded-error probabilistic machines. <p> The condition of normality proves easier to work with than the condition of being a source, and in this way we are able to improve the arguments of <ref> [L90] </ref>, showing that almost all sequences in PSPACE are sources. A third intuitive property of sources is hardness. <p> of S: For a string s; let s denote the string formed by dropping the last bit of s; and let s 0 denote the string formed by changing the last bit of s: Finally, let S [i::j] denote bits i through j of S: We define source as in <ref> [L90] </ref>. <p> is a probabilistic transducer whose output depends on coin flip outcomes, but M 0 uses randomness only to simulate M: A sequence S is a source if for all M and x we have lim inf 1 n X a i 2 Strictly speaking, this definition is stronger than in <ref> [L90] </ref>, where the liminf must be greater than 1=2 but may be less than 1=2 + r: In practice, however, proofs here and most proofs in [L90] that S is a source show that for any r 0 2 (0; r) the fraction of correct runs of M on S is <p> if for all M and x we have lim inf 1 n X a i 2 Strictly speaking, this definition is stronger than in <ref> [L90] </ref>, where the liminf must be greater than 1=2 but may be less than 1=2 + r: In practice, however, proofs here and most proofs in [L90] that S is a source show that for any r 0 2 (0; r) the fraction of correct runs of M on S is at least 1=2 + r 0 ; while proofs that S is not a source show that the fraction of correct runs is at most 1=2: <p> is a source show that for any r 0 2 (0; r) the fraction of correct runs of M on S is at least 1=2 + r 0 ; while proofs that S is not a source show that the fraction of correct runs is at most 1=2: As in <ref> [L90] </ref>, we will write SOURCE (B) for the set of all sources. We will also speak of sources for the bounded-error, input-ignoring machines, denoted SOURCE (B1), and the sources for the polynomial-time bounded-error machines will be denoted SOURCE (BPP). <p> time, compute M (w [1::i]) querying only bits in G M;n " f1; 2; : : : ig: A language L will be identified with its characteristic sequence L : enumerate the strings, and set bit i of L to 1 iff the i th string is in L: Following <ref> [L90] </ref>, we will say that a sequence - 4 - is in a complexity class iff it is the characteristic sequence of a language in that class. <p> Lutz has shown <ref> [L90] </ref> that almost every E 2 SPACE sequence is a source for B, (in the sense of measure defined there). We now show that almost every PSPACE sequence is normal (in the sense of measure in [M]), thereby concluding that almost every PSPACE sequence is a source.
