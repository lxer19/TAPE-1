Title: Accessing Nearby Copies of Replicated Objects in a Distributed Environment  
Author: C. Greg Plaxton Rajmohan Rajaraman Andrea W. Richa 
Abstract: Consider a set of shared objects in a distributed network, where several copies of each object may exist at any given time. To ensure both fast access to the objects as well as efficient utilization of network resources, it is desirable that each access request be satisfied by a copy "close" to the requesting node. Unfortunately, it is not clear how to efficiently achieve this goal in a dynamic, distributed environment in which large numbers of objects are continuously being created, replicated, and destroyed. In this paper, we design a simple randomized algorithm for accessing shared objects that tends to satisfy each access request with a nearby copy. The algorithm is based on a novel mechanism to maintain and distribute information about object locations, and requires only a small amount of additional memory at each node. We analyze our access scheme for a class of cost functions that captures the hierarchical nature of wide-area networks. We show that under the particular cost model considered: (i) the expected cost of an individual access is asymptotically optimal, and (ii) if objects are sufficiently large, the memory used for objects dominates the additional memory used by our algorithm with high probability. We also address dynamic changes in both the network as well as the set of object copies.

Reference-contexts: The basic problem of locating an object arises in every distributed system [10], and was formalized by Mullen-der and Vitanyi [11] as an instance of the distributed matchmaking problem. Awerbuch and Peleg [3], and subsequently Bartal et al. [4] and Awerbuch et al. <ref> [1] </ref>, give near-optimal solutions in terms of cost to a related problem by defining sparse-neighborhood covers of graphs. Their studies do not address the overhead due to control information and hence, natural extensions of their results to our problem may require an additional memory of m words at some node. <p> We refer the reader to the full ver sion of the paper [13] for the precise relationships among the constants. 5.1 Properties of Balls Given any u in V and any integer k in <ref> [1; n] </ref>, let N (u; k) denote the unique set of k nodes such that for any v in N (u; k) and w not in N (u; k), c (u; v) is less than c (u; w).

Then N (u; k) is a subset (resp., su-perset) of S iff N (u; k) is a subset of Q (u; S) (resp., superset of R (u; S)).

Reference-contexts: However, their cost model, which is based on the ultrametric, is different from ours. Also, their algorithms are primarily designed for problems associated with "hot spots" (i.e., popular objects). A closely related problem is that of designing a dynamic routing scheme for networks <ref> [2, 5] </ref>. Such a scheme involves maintaining routing tables at different nodes of the network in much the same way as our additional memory.

We assume that n is a power of 2 b , where b is a fixed positive integer to be specified later.
