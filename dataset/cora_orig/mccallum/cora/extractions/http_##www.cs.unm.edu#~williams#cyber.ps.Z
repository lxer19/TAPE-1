Abstract: We use generalized particle trajectories to derive an analytic expression characterizing the probability distribution of boundary-completion shape. This is essential to the understanding of the perceptual phenomenon of illusory (subjective) contours. The particles' dynamics include Poisson-distributed ensembles of driving forces as well as particle decay. The resulting field, representing completed surface boundaries, is characterized by the fraction of particles at x with velocity _x. The distributions are projectively covariant in the sense that fields calculated in any lower-dimensional projection correspond to the projections of fields calculated in any higher dimension. Being analytic, the relationship between velocity, diffusivity, and decay can be made readily apparent.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we note that these variances do not depend on the position, orientations or speeds at the keypoints. 7 A Neural Implementation Since Hubel and Wiesel <ref> [1] </ref>, neuroscientists have known that the receptive fields of neurons of the visual cortex form a retinotopic map and are localized in position, scale, and orientation. It follows that we can represent the pattern of activity of these neurons by a probability density function on a four-dimensional lattice.

Reference-contexts: Ullman suggested that illusory contours could be computed in parallel in a network by means of local operations, but he never tested this idea. Grossberg and Mingolla <ref> [3] </ref> describe a cooperative-competitive model of illusory contour formation which involves repeated convolution with a large kernel filter. The outputs of oppositely oriented filters are combined through a non-linear operation consisting of thresholding followed by a logical AND function.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, part of this complexity stems from their desire to model, in a comprehensive way, the many different forms of stimulus which can elicit illusory contours (e.g., contrast edges of mixed sign, line endings, etc.). No other model (including our own) is this comprehensive. More recently, Guy and Medioni <ref> [4] </ref> describe a method for computing a vector-field representing global image structure from local tangent measurements. The key to their approach 2 is the local summation of a set of global voting patterns representing orientations which are co-circular to the tangent measurements.

Reference-contexts: The key to their approach 2 is the local summation of a set of global voting patterns representing orientations which are co-circular to the tangent measurements. Consequently, the vector-field is non-stochastic (i.e., deterministic), and cannot model the prior distribution of completion shapes. Heitger and von der Heydt <ref> [5] </ref> describe a theory of figural completion based upon nonlinear combination of the convolutions of "keypoint" images with a fixed set of oriented grouping filters. <p> These represent locations where one surface occludes the boundary of another. Following <ref> [5] </ref>, these will be termed keypoints.

Reference-contexts: This random walk has the property that maximum likelihood paths are curves of least energy (i.e., the shape commonly assumed to model the shape of illusory contours <ref> [6] </ref>). In this paper, we use generalized particle trajectories to derive an analytic expression for this probability distribution, which Williams and Jacobs call the stochastic completion field.

Reference-contexts: In work in progress, we consider the "Poisson limit" where much stronger random forces act only rarely. By using a mixture of these two processes, it is possible to generate completion shapes which contain orientation discontinuities (i.e., corners). See for example, Kanizsa <ref> [8] </ref>, p. 95. 4 the source which reach x 2 with _x 2 at t 2 (having passed through x 3 with _x 3 at t 3 ) is given by the following expression: Z t 3 dt 1 P (2; 3 j 1)I 1 (t 1 ) 1 Now, if <p> The gaps in the completed figure are due to an implementation detail. Otherwise, there is close agreement between the results produced by each method. The second demonstration is the well known Kanizsa triangle <ref> [8] </ref> (see Figure 6 (top)). The source distribution consisted of a set of oriented impulses representing the orientations of contours bounding regions of constant brightness at positive maxima of curvature (see [16]). In general, these are points where it is likely that one surface occludes the boundary of another. <p> Figure 8 (top) shows the stochastic completion field from [16] summed over all orientations and superimposed on the brightness gradient magnitude image.

This figure illustrates that whether or not an illusory contour is perceived is not solely a function of local factors, but also depends on whether or not the completion can be incorporated in a topologically valid surface organization.

Reference-contexts: Williams and Jacobs [16] defined the illusory contour shape and salience problem to be the problem of computing the the shape and relative likelihood (as determined by the prior probability distribution) of the family of curves which potentially connect (or complete) a set of contrast edges. Like Mumford <ref> [9] </ref>, they proposed that the probability distribution can be modeled by a random walk in a space of positions and orientations. This random walk has the property that maximum likelihood paths are curves of least energy (i.e., the shape commonly assumed to model the shape of illusory contours [6]). <p> This corresponds to letting particles decay with an average rate of 1=o 21 . Because this makes longer trajectories exponentially less likely, both Mumford <ref> [9] </ref> and Williams and Jacobs [16] employed this mechanism to model the component of the prior distribution of completion shape dependent on length. 2 Other temporal filters, Q 21 (t 2 ; t 1 ), serving alternative purposes could be used if needed. 6 Expected Tra jectory In this section, we <p> Note that the stochastic process which forms the basis for our analytic solution is somewhat more general than that described in [16] and <ref> [9] </ref>. Most importantly, we assume that both a particle's speed and orientation can change, while they assumed that orientation varies but speed remains constant. Since position and orientation are the only comparable degrees of freedom, we will use (x; y; ) instead of (x; _x), in the following discussion.

Reference-contexts: At the implementation level, it is essentially the same as the network 12 described by Peterhans, von der Heydt and Baumgartner <ref> [10] </ref> although the source, sink and completion fields would have to be represented by distinct populations of neurons in V2. 8 Comparison w/Monte Carlo Method In [16] the stochastic completion field was computed for a range of illusory contour figures from the visual psychology literature.

Reference-contexts: Being analytic, the relationship between velocity, dif-fusivity, and decay (all components of the original treatment) can be made readily apparent. 2 Prior Work The earliest theory of illusory contour shape is due to Ullman <ref> [14] </ref>. Ullman hypothesized that the curve used by the human visual system to join two contour fragments is constructed from two circular arcs. Each circular arc is tangent to its sponsoring contour at one end and to the other arc at the point of intersection.
