Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new class of stochastic Petri nets in which one or more places can hold fluid rather than discrete tokens. We define a class of fluid stochastic Petri nets in such a way that the discrete and continuous portions may affect each other. Following this definition we provide equations for their transient and steady-state behavior. We present several examples showing the utility of the construct in communication network modeling and reliability analysis, and discuss important special cases. We then discuss numerical methods for computing the transient behavior of such nets. Finally, some numerical examples are presented and evidence of the accuracy of the fluid approximation is given.

Let S be the discrete state space and let Q (~x) = [q ij (~x)] be the matrix of transition rates derived from the firing rate function F of Section 2. S corresponds to the set of tangible discrete markings in M d . <p> order to avoid the difficulty of solving Equation (6) in an arbitrarily large and a priori unknown domain when one or more fluid places have an unbounded capacity, we can perform the coordinate transformation y k = 1 e x k (16) which maps the infinite interval x k = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> to the finite interval y k = [0; 1]. Equation (6) then becomes @ ~ H + k @y k ~ HR k (~y) (1 y k ) = ~ HQ (~y) 0 @Q d~y (17) for ~ H (t; ~y). The boundary and initial conditions remain unchanged. <p> in an arbitrarily large and a priori unknown domain when one or more fluid places have an unbounded capacity, we can perform the coordinate transformation y k = 1 e x k (16) which maps the infinite interval x k = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> to the finite interval y k = [0; 1].

We have K sources of ATM cells. <p> The results for the number of packets in the buffer are shown in Figure 8.

Fluid flow can be thought of as approximating an essentially discrete process, the transmission of packets. To investigate the accuracy of a fluid approximation to the "true" discrete process we considered a discrete alternative to the fluid model, illustrated in Figure 9.

Reference-contexts: The next example shows how fluid levels may affect the firing rate of discrete transitions. Consider a system with N statistically identical and independent components, each with a failure rate that depends on the overall system load <ref> [12] </ref>; the repair rate is . Work arrives to the system at a constant rate r and is completed at rate d per functioning machine. Work here is considered to be a non-negative real quantity. We model this system as an FSPN shown in Figure 3.

Reference-contexts: each x k , and must therefore approach an asymptotic value as x k tends to infinity (or reaches its maximal value). 2 This method of deriving partial differential equations that represent conservation laws is well established in computational fluid dynamics, where it is known as the "Finite Volume" technique <ref> [16] </ref>. 7 The assumptions on R k (~x) can be relaxed and we can allow R k (~x) to be piecewise differentiable and fluid places to have finite capacities. This may introduce non-zero probability masses at the inter-region boundaries and will need to be explicitly accounted for. <p> In addition, the main diagonal coefficient is the negative sum of the other entries in its column, since each value of r i;::: contributes to the equations at neighbouring spatial locations, but with differing sign. Details of the upwind discretization may be found, for example, in <ref> [16] </ref>. Each sub-matrix W i , and thus also W, therefore represents the transpose of a CTMC. The linear system of ordinary differential equations (14) thus defined may be integrated by any standard method.

Reference-contexts: It is natural to extend the stochastic Petri net (SPN) framework to Fluid Stochastic Petri Nets (FSPNs) by introducing places with continuous tokens and arcs with fluid flow so as to handle stochastic fluid flow systems. This paper extends the model in an earlier paper <ref> [19] </ref> by allowing the level of fluid in continuous places to affect the enabling of timed transitions and the rates of fluid flow into and out of continuous places. Rules for transition enabling and firing are extended to reflect the notion that flow through a fluid place represents token movement. <p> The basic extension we have made from <ref> [19] </ref> here is that fluid levels in continuous places can change the enabling/disabling of timed transitions in the discrete part of the net. <p> The firing rate function F is defined for timed transitions T E so that F : T E fi M ! IR + : Thus if a timed transition t is enabled in (tangible) marking m, it fires with rate F (t; m). Note once again that in <ref> [19] </ref>, these rates were not allowed to depend upon the fluid levels but now we do allow the firing rates to be dependent on fluid levels. As in [19], the weight function W is defined for immediate transitions T I so that W : T I fi M d ! IR <p> Note once again that in <ref> [19] </ref>, these rates were not allowed to depend upon the fluid levels but now we do allow the firing rates to be dependent on fluid levels. As in [19], the weight function W is defined for immediate transitions T I so that W : T I fi M d ! IR + : Thus if an immediate transition i is enabled in (a vanishing) marking m d , it fires with probability W (i; m d ) 2T I <p> Observe that since m t contains continuous levels ~x, r k (m t ) may change as a function of t even if the discrete part of m t does not change. Once again we have extended the definition in <ref> [19] </ref> by allowing these rates to be dependent on fluid levels. Now let X k (t) be the fluid level at time t in a continuous place k 2 P c .
