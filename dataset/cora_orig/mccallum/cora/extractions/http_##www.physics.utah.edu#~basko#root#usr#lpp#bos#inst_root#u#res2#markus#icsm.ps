Abstract: We have applied the action spectrum technique to the photoinduced absorption (PA) band of triplet excitons (TE) in luminescent polymers such as PPV and mLPPP, and nonluminescent polymers such as polydiacetylene (PDA), to obtain the TE photogeneration quantum effiency excitation spectra. In all three cases the TE photogeneration spectrum shows an onset at the optical gap, and in addition they also show a second photogeneration onset at excitation energies higher than the optical gap. This second onset is explained by singlet exciton fission into triplet pairs. We introduce a model to fit the spectra and obtain the TE energy as a fitting parameter.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction and Experimental We have used the action spectrum spectroscopy <ref> [1] </ref> to obtain the photogeneration quantum efficiency (PQE) vs. <p> It is thus apparent that TE generation occurs via two main processes. The first process is associated with the generation of thermalized singlet excitons and therefore has a similar PQE dependence on E as that of the PL <ref> [1] </ref>. The second process, with an onset at E&gt;E op is therefore due to hot excitons and occurs very quickly. We identify this second process as singlet exciton fission (SF); (Ex!T"+T#).

Reference-contexts: The fit through the data points (Fig. 1) has been obtained by a model describing SF, that we want to introduce in this paper. The theoretical prediction for the SF PQE spectrum is a step function response with an onset at 2E T <ref> [2] </ref>. But our spectra (Fig. 1) do not show this sharp step function response. On the contrary, the rise prior to reaching the plateau is spread out over several tenths of eV.

Reference-contexts: The relative strength of the emission of p phonons during the electronic transition is described by the Huang-Rhys formula: h (p) = p! To quantify the inhomogenous broadening we have fitted the interband absorption band for each of the three polymers with an assymetric gaussian distribution <ref> [3] </ref>. Let us call the distribution resulting from this fit D'(E), whereas D (E) is the distribution obtained by summing up over the vibronic progressions. D (E) is then given by D (E) = p=0 SF produces pairs of TE which are usually on neighboring chains or neighboring chain segments.
