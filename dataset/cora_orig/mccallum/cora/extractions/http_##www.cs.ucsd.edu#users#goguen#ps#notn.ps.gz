Abstract: An earlier version of this paper without figures ap-pears in TOOLS 10: Technology of Object-Oriented Languages and Systems, edited by Boris Magnus-son, Bertrand Meyer and Jean-Francois Perrot, Prentice-Hall, 1993, pages 5-10. On Notation 1 Abstract: It has often been noted that discussions among computer scientists about notation can be more heated and protracted than discussions about issues usually considered more substantive. This suggests there may be more to notation than is admitted in phrases like "mere syntax" and "syntactic sugar". Building on C.S. Peirce's classification of signs into icon, index and symbol, I argue for the importance of notation, and in particular, for the importance of diagrams and other visual forms of presentation in addition to purely textual presentations. I also suggest some criteria for evaluating the quality of notation. These considerations are illustrated by notation from Euclidean geometry, programming languages, arithmetic, algebra, and formal methods; applications to databases and Computer Supported Cooperative Work are also mentioned, as are connections with recent work in philosophy and sociology, including postmodernism and ethnomethodology.

Reference-contexts: In fact, I believe that programmers should learn more mathematics, but I also say that designers of notation for formal methods should make better use of graphics. A successful example is the use of "boxes" in Z <ref> [1] </ref> to graphically indicate certain scoping conventions; this has been extended further in object oriented versions of Z, such as Object-Z [5] and OOZE [2], to allow nested scoping and module delimitation. This use of graphical notation is iconic, without compromising the underlying semantics of Z.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, a sign x is an index for an object y if x and y are regularly connected, in the sense "that always or usually when there is an x, there is also a y in some more or less exactly specifiable spatio-temporal relation to the x in question" <ref> [3] </ref>. "Such, for instance, is a piece of mould with a bullet-hole in it as sign of a shot" [17]. In this example, the spatio-temporal relation is a causal one, and applies with great generality.

Reference-contexts: Dijkstra) feel that any use of diagramatic or verbal reasoning is bad, because it enables, and even encourages, sloppy intuitive thinking, as opposed to precise, linear, logical reasoning 2 . "The moral is clear: for doing high-quality mathematics effectively, verbal and pictoral reasoning have to be replaced by calculational reasoning" <ref> [4] </ref>. I argue that such views are profoundly wrong, and even harmful; they represent an extreme form of modernism that calls forth postmodernism as a counter-movement.

Reference-contexts: She shows that certain categories, relationships, and methods assumed by the designer are not shared by users.

Ethnomethodology was created by Harold Garfinkel <ref> [6] </ref> essentially as a criticism of classical normative sociology. Largely through the work of Harvey Sacks [18], ethnomethodology developed into conversation analysis, a highly empirical, detailed and precise theory of how conversation is organized, and in particular, of how turntaking is accomplished.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, exactly such precision can facilitate communication at later phases of specification.

Reference-contexts: More recently, interaction analysis has taken advantage of video technology to extend the principles of ethnomethodology to non-linguistic interaction <ref> [12] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: I would particularly mention the work of Jean-Fran~cois Lyotard <ref> [15] </ref>, who says that modernism is characterized (among other things) by the use of "grand metanarratives" (i.e., all-inclusive stories, or explanatory systems) to "legitimate" (i.e., to justify the structure of) social systems. Examples include communism, socialism, capitalism, progressivism and liberalism, at the level of whole societies.

Reference-contexts: One has only to think of the "black box" diagrams that are so widely used in system design, and the many exotic notations used in so-called structured analysis <ref> [16] </ref>, including object oriented notations; e.g., see Figure 2. It is almost impossible to fina a group of system analysts and/or programmers discussing a design without seeing them draw 5 such diagrams.

In this example, the spatio-temporal relation is a causal one, and applies with great generality. However some indices only work in certain particular spatio-temporal contexts, such as proper names for persons.
