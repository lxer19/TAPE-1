Abstract: Let F(n) be a family of partitions of n and let F(n; d) denote the set of partitions in F(n) with Durfee square of size d. We define the Durfee polynomial of F(n) to be the polynomial P F;n = P jF(n; d)jy d , where 0 d b work in this paper is motivated by empirical evidence which suggests that for several families F, all roots of the Durfee polynomial are real. Such a result would imply that the corresponding sequence of coefficients fjF(n; d)jg is log-concave and unimodal and that, over all partitions in F(n) for fixed n, the p

Reference-contexts: It is well-known that if all roots of the polynomial P a d x d ; 0 d N are real (and hence negative), then fa d g is strictly log-concave in d and therefore unimodal with a peak or a plateau of two points. (See <ref> [5, 17] </ref>, for example). What is perhaps less well-known is that this condition on the roots guarantees that the average index and a most likely index of fa d g differ by at most one [2, 7].
