Reference-contexts: So this restricted component of brain activity could be subject to the logical modeling. The experiments of the agent scenario understanding show that various autistic children experience the lack of (formally) the same meanings of believing and pretending. Conclusions For comparison, we mention two metalanguage reasoning systems <ref> [14, 15] </ref>, which could serve as an appropriate basis for our problems after addition of the metalanguage transfer 50 rules, representations for KU, KS and other features, described in this paper.

Reference-contexts: if Doug knows which computer to buy know (bill, ( know (doug, buy (bill, UnknownComputer)), not know (doug, UnknownComputer) )). 7.2 Axioms for pretending and believing We first consider the simple axiom system of pretending as a modal operator, which is based on the traditional concept of knowledge, presented elsewhere <ref> [17] </ref>. Based on the modal operator of knowledge, one is unable to express the series of concepts like "good will" versus "deceptive" pretending.

Reference-contexts: In purpose of simplification we skip the expression that Action occurs in Matter.

These scenarios contain the description of what happened with some agents and questions to the autistic/control agent. We consider this questions as "reaction stimulation" and do not 49 present them explicitly in the formal scenario.
