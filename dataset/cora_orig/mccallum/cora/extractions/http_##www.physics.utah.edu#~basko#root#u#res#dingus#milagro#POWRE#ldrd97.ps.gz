Abstract: When viewed with visible light the Universe appears relatively tranquil. When observed with high-energy photons the picture is dramatically altered. At energies above ~1 GeV (1 GeV = 10 9 eV) the Universe appears violent and variable. The objects one sees are mostly compact objects black holes and neutron stars; matter densities greater than 10 15 g cm 3 , black holes 10 billion times more massive than our sun, magnetic fields a billion times stronger than the earth's field, and rotational periods less than 1 second these are the norm. In addition gamma-ray bursts flash into existence from seemingly random locations for several seconds and then apparently vanish forever. Beyond about 10 eV the atmosphere becomes opaque to electromagnetic radiation. At great expense, telescopes have been launched into earth orbit to observe the high-energy cosmos. The low and rapidly falling particle flux limits the energy reach of satellite instruments to about 30 GeV . Above about 200 GeV interactions between the cosmic ray and the nuclei in the atmosphere generate a particle cascade that can be detected with ground-based telescopes. Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy has made great progress in the past decade, with the discovery of 5 sources of TeV (10 12 eV) gamma rays by Air Cerenkov telescopes. However, the current generation of air Cerenkov telescopes only view a small portion of the sky (~ 10 3 sr), making them ill-suited to study a variable and transient sky. In this proposal we ask for funds to develop a new type of air Cerenkov telescope with a wide field of view and an energy threshold of 500 GeV. The Cerenkov signal generated by a cosmic ray must be detected over the night-sky background light. Since the Cerenkov signal is beamed in a narrow cone there is a trade-off between field-of-view and energy threshold. Current air Cerenkov telescopes either have a small aperture or a high-energy threshold (&gt; 30 TeV). We have developed a novel design that will enable us to achieve an energy threshold of 500 GeV and an aperture of 1 sr. We are requesting funds to build a prototype instrument with the same energy threshold but with a smaller aperture (~ 0:05 sr). Although this instrument is a prototype it will still be a powerful telescope. We will be able to monitor a relatively large area of the sky for transient phenomena and we will be able to study the TeV emission from one AGN. Most importantly, we will make the first measurement of the composition of the cosmic rays in the critical energy range between 10 TeV and 1 PeV. With the successful completion of this work we will apply for external funds (~$2M) to construct the complete instrument.

Reference-contexts: The energy source is accretion the change in gravitational potential energy of in-falling matter. Typical AGN have luminosities of 10 45 ergs sec 1 . A large fraction of this energy is emitted in high-energy gamma rays. tion of the unified model of radio-loud AGN <ref> [1] </ref>. Particles are accelerated to high energies in the jets of the AGN. When the jets are viewed on axis, relativistic effects boost of the apparent energy and density of the accelerated particles, which increases the apparent luminosity up to 1000-fold [2].

This enables the observation of GeV and TeV photons. Relativistic effects also cause a Lorentz contraction of the time scale. So as one views the AGN closer to the jet axis the time scale of variability decreases. Recent observations have confirmed the above picture.

Reference-contexts: In Figure 2 we show the detected flux of TeV photons from Mrk 501 (an AGN of the blazar class) during March-April 1997 [4]. While it is known that the high-energy emission emanates from the jets, the nature of the jet mechanism itself is poorly understood <ref> [3] </ref>. For example, it is not known if electrons or protons are accelerated in the jets, nor how they are accelerated (i.e. shock acceleration, direct acceleration, etc.). High resolution spectra at energies near 10 TeV are needed to answer these questions.

Reference-contexts: Even with the limited duty-cycle and field-of-view of current instruments, the variability of the sources has been well documented.

Reference-contexts: Mrk 501 versus Modified Julian Date. Direct measurements of the cosmic-ray composition made with high-altitude balloon flights show that protons dominate the cosmic-ray flux below 100 TeV <ref> [5] </ref>. At higher energies the flux is too low for direct measurements and ground-based techniques are used. By their nature ground-based techniques are indirect and depend upon Monte Carlo simulations of extensive air showers to interpret the data.

Reference-contexts: In the last 3 years we have proven the validity of this technique. With funding from a LDRD grant in collaboration with M. Hillas and S. Paling (University of Leeds) we constructed a wide angle air Cerenkov array at LANL, within the CYGNUS-II air shower array <ref> [6] </ref>. This instrument consisted of 6 large area PMTs viewing ~ 20 ffi of the sky. The PMTs were arranged in two groups of three with the two groupings separated by ~ 120 meters. We measured the density of Cerenkov light close to and far from the shower core.
