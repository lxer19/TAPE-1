Abstract: Set constraints are relations between sets of terms. They have been used extensively in various applications in program analysis and type inference. We present several results on the computational complexity of solving systems of set constraints. The systems we study form a natural complexity hierarchy depending on the form of the constraint language.

Reference-contexts: A valuation satisfies the constraint E F if (E) (F ). A set S of constraints is satisfiable if there is a valuation that satisfies all constraints in S simultaneously. An algorithm for determining the satisfiability of general systems of positive set constraints was first presented in <ref> [4] </ref>. In this paper, we extend the results of [4] in two ways. In Section 5, we give a new characterization of the satisfiability problem that may be of independent interest. <p> A set S of constraints is satisfiable if there is a valuation that satisfies all constraints in S simultaneously.

In Section 5, we give a new characterization of the satisfiability problem that may be of independent interest. <p> We show that deciding whether S is satisfiable is equivalent to deciding whether or not a certain finite hypergraph constructed from S has an induced subhypergraph that is closed (see Section 4). This characterization is simpler than the one in <ref> [4] </ref> and has the additional advantage for complexity analysis that the hypergraphs can be specified using short Boolean formulas. In Section 6, we exploit the hypergraph characterization of the satisfiability problem to obtain a family of complexity results for the satisfiability problem. <p> See [15] for more general results on solving negative constraints in arbitrary Boolean algebras. Finally, set constraints have been studied for their own sake and several algorithms for solving set constraints have been proposed <ref> [12, 4, 10] </ref>. Our results differ from these in that we are interested primarily in the complexity of the satisfiability problem for set constraints. 3 Set Expressions and Set Constraints Let be a finite ranked alphabet consisting of symbols f, each with an associated arity arity (f ) 2 N.
