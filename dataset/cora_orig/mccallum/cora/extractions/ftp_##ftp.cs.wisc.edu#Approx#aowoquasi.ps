Abstract: In the study of approximation order, particularly in a multi-variable setting, quasi-interpolants have played a major role. This report points out some limitations of quasi-interpolants and describes some recent results on approximation order obtained without the benefit of the quasi-interpolant idea. * norm? In this report, I will usually consider X = L p (G), with G some `suitable' subset of R d , e.g., either a bounded convex body, or else all of R d . In fact, the major results reported are for G = R d and p = 2 or p = 1. With X such a function space, x1. Approximation Order

Reference-contexts: Approximation Order in L 2 For an arbitrary ' 2 X := L 2 (R d ), the approximation order of S (') can be characterized completely, in terms of b'. This is due to the fact (proved in [6] but also derivable from more general results in <ref> [17] </ref>) that, if P S is the orthogonal projector onto S ('), then d P S f = [ b'; b'] where [ b f; b'] : T d !
