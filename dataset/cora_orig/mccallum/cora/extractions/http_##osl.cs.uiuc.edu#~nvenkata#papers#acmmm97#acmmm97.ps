Abstract: In this paper, we address the issues in designing metrics that are important in evaluating the Quality of Service(QoS) of video transmission. We propose a new metric for video QoS called the weighted cost-satisfaction ratio based on requirements from two perspectives: the user and the service provider. To understand real video workload environments and user behavioral patterns, we obtained empirical results from the VOSAIC (video-over-the-Web) system and analyzed them. Based on these results, we define parameters of resource-cost (storage and network bandwidth etc.) and user satisfaction (jitter, synchronization skew) and derive analytical interrelationships among the metric parameters. We also draw an economic relationship between the user-satisfaction and resource consumption factors to solve metric optimization relations. Keywords: QoS, video, resource consumption, user satisfaction, workload.

VOSAIC is essentially a framework for the integration of audiovisual information into a standard hypertext document and Web environment. It transmits information on-demand in real-time over the current Internet. While traditional VOD systems are designed to operate in a constrained environment, VOSAIC is designed to operate in unconstrained environments.

Reference-contexts: Since network and system conditions are likely to be dynamic, the optimal operating point is not constant and this represents yet another challenge in QoS enforcement. Several QoS parameters such as deadlines and packet losses <ref> [3] </ref> must dynamically adapt during processing and communication. Violation of the QoS bounds portrays itself as flickering video, distorted audio, blanks and frozen images. 2 2.2 The Workload Model Selection criteria for video QoS metrics come from two perspectives the end-user and the service provider.

Reference-contexts: Such models have no incentive for proper usage and hence are inappropriate for our purposes. Complex models of pricing include bidding mechanisms where a server constantly and continuously negotiates for the best price. Studies indicate that fixed-rate pricing policies perform substantially worse than volume-based pricing policies for Internet traffic <ref> [4] </ref>. Economic models for network provisioning have been studied in [12]. A market-system approach to improve QoS on the Internet involves negotiating and establishing price and quality contracts based on economic prin ciples [4]. <p> Studies indicate that fixed-rate pricing policies perform substantially worse than volume-based pricing policies for Internet traffic <ref> [4] </ref>.

Pricing schemes that charge more for peak time usage discourage non-critical requests when the system and network are overloaded.

Reference-contexts: Network QoS parameters include bandwidth, delay, jitter and loss rate. End-system parameters include CPU load, utilization, buffering mechanisms and storage related parameters. Users express dynamic preferences for media quality through benefit functions, <ref> [13] </ref>, for e.g. (1) frame rate benefit function which indicates that beyond a threshold frame rate, there is no additional benefit. (2) synchronization benefit function which indicates that the benefit is high only when the audio/video synchronization skew is low.
