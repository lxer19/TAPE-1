Abstract: We study the minimum-cost bounded-skew routing tree problem under the Elmore delay model. We present two approaches to construct bounded-skew routing trees: (i) the Boundary Merging and Embedding (BME) method which utilizes merging points that are restricted to the boundaries of merging regions, and (ii) the Interior Merging and Embedding (IME) algorithm which employs a sampling strategy and dynamic programming to consider merging points that are interior to, rather than on the boundary of, the merging regions. Our new algorithms allow accurate control of Elmore delay skew, and show the utility of merging points inside merging regions.

Reference-contexts: In general, not only is the correlation poor, but the pathlength-based BST solutions of [8, 12] are simply unable to meet tight skew bounds (of 100ps or less). On the other hand, Figure 1 (b) demonstrates the accuracy and fidelity of El-more delay skew to actual skew; cf. <ref> [2] </ref>. Converting a zero pathlength skew routing into a zero Elmore delay skew routing via the use of snaking [17] usually entails substantial increase in total wirelength. Thus, in this work, we pursue new approacheswhich directly address the BST problem under Elmore delay. <p> 1 g (Figure 8): err i [m 0 ; k 0 ] = f (min skew (R i+m 0 1 ) min skew (R i+m 0 2 ))fi (Cap (R i ) Cap (R i+m 0 2 ))g + err i [m 0 1; k 0 ] (2) S i <ref> [m 0 1; 2] </ref>; the darker region is the product term given in Eqn. (2). <p> Suppose i 0 is the index of the region after i in the optimal solution S i [m 0 ; k 0 ], then the error of the new staircase between the skews min skew (R i ) and min skew (R i 0 ) is given by err i <ref> [i 0 i + 1; 2] </ref> which is computed by Eqn. (2). Now, we have to select the optimal solution S i 0 [m 0 i 0 + i; k 0 1] from the regions fR i 0 ; :::;R i+m 0 1 g. <p> Now, we have to select the optimal solution S i 0 [m 0 i 0 + i; k 0 1] from the regions fR i 0 ; :::;R i+m 0 1 g. Note that R i 0 is retained in both sub-solutions S i <ref> [i 0 i + 1; 2] </ref> and S i 0 [m 0 i 0 + i; k 0 1], and i &lt; i 0 m 0 k 0 + i + 1. <p> Therefore, we iterate i 0 from i + 1 to m 0 k 0 + i + 1 and compute the optimal error err i [m 0 ; k 0 ] as follows: err i [m 0 ; k 0 ] = min ferr i <ref> [i 0 i + 1; 2] </ref>+ err i 0 [m 0 i 0 + i; k 0 1]g (3) A straightforward implementation of the above computation gives an O (k m 3 )-time optimal (m; k)-sampling algorithm.

Notice that in maintaining zero skew, the original DME approach always merges two subtrees at their roots. <p> The benchmark test cases r1-r5 [17] were used to evaluate our algorithms for skew bounds in the range of 0-10ns. Table 1 compares the zero-skew clock routing costs of the best known algorithm (CL+I6 from <ref> [11] </ref>) with the various bounded-skew routing costs obtained by our algorithms. In this experiment, the IME algorithm keeps at most k = 5 merging regions for each internal node, and slices each merging region to s = 7 sampling segments for merging with other nodes. <p> It appears that IME produces better results for larger circuits when the skew bound is large, but at the expense of longer running time. In general, we see a decrease in total wirelength as the skew increases. However, our results do not compare favorably with <ref> [11] </ref> when it comes to zero skew. We believe that this is due to the fact that the CL+I6 algorithm performs local optimization using exhaustive search and calculates an optimum sequence, which we did not implement in our algorithm. <p> The results for the circuit r3 are shown in Figure 9. When the skew bound is relaxed from zero to 150ps, we achieved a power reduction of 17.6%. We also achieved 25.8% wirelength reduction when compared to the best reported zero-skew solution (by the CL+I6 algorithm in <ref> [11] </ref>). 6 Conclusion and Future Work In conclusion, we have presented new bounded-skew routing tree approaches under the Elmore delay model. We prove several key properties of the merging regions under the Elmore delay model.

In practice, circuits will operate correctly within a given skew tolerance, and indeed exact zero skew is never an actual design requirement [14]. Two recent works [8, 12] have addressed the bounded-skew routing tree (BST) problem, and proposed clock and Steiner global routing algorithms that construct BSTs under the linear, i.e., pathlength, delay model.

The work of [12] also gives an Extended-Planar-DME method which again matches the best known heuristics <ref> [15] </ref> when the routing tree must be embeddable on a single layer. 3 The Boundary Merging and Embedding Method We now present our BoundaryMerging and Embedding (BME) method, which encompassesthe straightforward generalizations of Ex-DME and ExG-DME from pathlength to Elmore delay.

[2]. Converting a zero pathlength skew routing into a zero Elmore delay skew routing via the use of snaking <ref> [17] </ref> usually entails substantial increase in total wirelength. Thus, in this work, we pursue new approacheswhich directly address the BST problem under Elmore delay. <p> 9470000 10 (BME) 1087703 2155481 2789321 5411936 8140187 100 (BME) 926205 2201023 2515178 4860958 7375204 1000 (BME) 793498 1839666 2506399 4971769 7134697 10000 (BME) 780100 1668872 2102182 4017261 6136574 Table 1: Total wirelengths and skews of the clock routings generated by the BME and IME algorithms for benchmark circuits r1-5 <ref> [17] </ref>.
