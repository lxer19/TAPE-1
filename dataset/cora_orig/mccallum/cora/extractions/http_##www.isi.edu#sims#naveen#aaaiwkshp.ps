Abstract: We present an approach for optimizing the performance of information agents by materializing useful information . A critical problem with information agents, particularly those gathering and integrating information from Web sources is a high query response time. This is because the data needed to answer user queries is present across several different Web sources (and in several pages within a source) and retrieving,extracting and integrating the data is time consuming. We address this problem by materializing useful classes of information and defining them as auxiliary data sources for the information agent. The key challenge here is to identify the content and schema of the classes of information that would be useful to materialize. We present an algorithm that identifies such classes by analyzing patterns in user queries. We describe an implementation of our approach and experiments in progress. We also discuss other important problems that we will address in optimizing information agents.

Overall Optimization Approach Our approach to optimization is based on an idea described in <ref> (Arens & Knoblock 1994) </ref> where we identify useful classes of information to materialize, materialize the data in these classes in a database local to the agent and define these classes as auxiliary information sources that the agent can access.

Reference-contexts: Caching schemes have also been proposed for Web proxy servers <ref> (Chankunthod et al. 1995) </ref> to reduce the amount of data that must be shipped over the internet. However these approaches are based on caching at the level of individual Web pages, which we argued is not optimal in our environment.

Reference-contexts: The sims query planner is designed to generate high quality plans and will generate plans that attempt to use the materialized data sources to the maximum extent. We use the materialized data in essentially the same manner as in a semantic caching <ref> (Dar et al. 1996) </ref> system. <p> Most work on client-server database systems caching and operating systems caching has focused on tuple level or page level caching. Only recent approaches are based on semantic level <ref> (Dar et al. 1996) </ref> or predicate based (Keller & Basu 1996) caching.

Reference-contexts: This approach provides quite limited semantic reasoning capabilities about the contents of the cached data as compared to our approach in which we are able to perform more powerful reasoning of the materialized data contents through loom. Another approach to caching for federated databases is described in <ref> (Goni et al. 1997) </ref>. Theirs is also a semantic caching approach where the data cached is described by queries.

Reference-contexts: The Ariadne architecture also borrows heavily from that of sims. sims is used to integrate information from mainly database systems whereas Ariadne integrates information from semi-structured Web sources. We then provide a high level description of our optimization approach. SIMS Architecture In the sims system we use the loom <ref> (MacGregor 1988) </ref>knowledge representation language (we can also perceive this as a data model) for modeling data. The user is presented with an integrated view of the information in several different sources which is known as the domain model.
