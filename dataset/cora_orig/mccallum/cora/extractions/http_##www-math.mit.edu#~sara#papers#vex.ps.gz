Abstract: In analogy with the symmetric group, we define the vexillary elements in the hyperoctahedral group to be those for which the Stanley symmetric function is a single Schur Q-function. We show that the vexillary elements can again be determined by pattern avoidance conditions. These results can be extended to include the root systems of types A, B, C, and D. Finally, we give an algorithm for multiplication of Schur Q-functions with a superfied Schur function and a method for determining the shape of a vexillary signed permutation using jeu de taquin.

Reference-contexts: Let B n be the hyperoctahedral group (or signed permutation group). The elements of B n are permutations with a sign attached to every entry. We use the compact notation where a bar is written over an element with a negative sign. For example <ref> [ 3; 2; 1] </ref> 2 B 3 . <p> The recursion terminates when w is strictly increasing in which case F w = Q where is the partition obtained from arranging fjw i j : w i &lt; 0g in decreasing order. 5 For example, let w = <ref> [ 4; 1; 2; 3] </ref>. Then r = 2 since w 2 &gt; w 3 is a descent and w 3 &lt; w 4 , and s = 3 since w 3 &lt; w 2 &lt; w 4 . <p> Then r = 2 since w 2 &gt; w 3 is a descent and w 3 &lt; w 4 , and s = 3 since w 3 &lt; w 2 &lt; w 4 . This implies wt rs = <ref> [ 4; 2; 1; 3] </ref> and we have F [ 4;1; 2;3] = F [ 4;1; 2;3]t 23 t 12 + F [ 4;1; 2;3]t 23 s 32 = F [ 2; 4;1;3] + F [ 4; 3;1;2] : (6) Continuing to expand the right hand side we see [ 4; <p> = [ 4; 2; 1; 3] and we have F [ 4;1; 2;3] = F [ 4;1; 2;3]t 23 t 12 + F [ 4;1; 2;3]t 23 s 32 = F [ 2; 4;1;3] + F [ 4; 3;1;2] : (6) Continuing to expand the right hand side we see <ref> [ 4; 3; 1; 2] </ref> is strictly increasing so F [ 4; 3;1;2] = Q (4;3) and F [ 2; 4;1;3] = F [ 2; 4;1;3]t 12 s 15 = F [ 5; 2;1;3;4] = Q (5;2) . Hence, F [ 4;1; 2;3] = Q (4;3) + Q (5;2) . <p> For example, fl ( 6; 3; 7; 0:5) = <ref> [ 3; 2; 4; 1] </ref>. Any word containing the subsequence 6; 3; 7; 0:5 does not avoid the pattern 32 41. Another way to describe pattern avoidance is with the signed permutation matrices. <p> The proof of Theorem 14 is very similar to the proof of Theorem 7 given above. The analogs of Proposition 2 are given in <ref> [1] </ref>. Again the proof relies on a computer verification that these patterns characterize all vexillary elements in B 6 and D 6 . 4. <p> Repeat the procedure for the box containing 2 0 and so on until all the primed numbers are removed. 6. The resulting tableau of shifted shape is denoted U fl V . We illustrate the procedure with an example. Suppose w = <ref> [3; 2; 4; 1] </ref> then w = uv where u is [4; 2; 1; 3] and v is [4; 2; 1; 3]. Let U = 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 4 . <p> The resulting tableau of shifted shape is denoted U fl V .

The definition of vexillary can be extended using Stanley symmetric functions of type B and D. These cover the remaining infinite families of root systems. It was shown in <ref> [2, 12] </ref> that these Stanley symmetric functions are always nonnegative linear combinations of Schur P -functions. For these cases, we define vexillary by the condition that the Stanley symmetric function is a single Schur P -function with coefficient 1. <p> Repeat the procedure for the box containing 2 0 and so on until all the primed numbers are removed. 6.

For which shifted shape does F w = Q if w 2 B 1 ? For w 2 S 1 there are several ways to determine this shape: the transition equation [18, p. 52], inserting a single reduced word using the Edelman-Greene correspondence <ref> [6] </ref>, or by rearranging the code in decreasing order [23]. For a vexillary element of type C one can find the shape for which F w = Q by using the recursive formula (5) or by using the Kraskiewicz insertion [10] or Haiman procedures [9] on a single reduced word.

Reference-contexts: Reiner and Shimozono [21] have given a new interpretation of the coefficients ff w in terms of D (w)-peelable tableaux. 4 Stanley also conjectured that there should be an analog of (3) for B n . This conjecture was proved independently by Haiman <ref> [9] </ref> and Kraskiewicz [10] in the following form: #R (w) = fi where g is the number of standard tableaux on the shifted shape , and fi w is the coefficient of Q when F w is expanded in terms of the Schur Q-functions. <p> For a vexillary element of type C one can find the shape for which F w = Q by using the recursive formula (5) or by using the Kraskiewicz insertion [10] or Haiman procedures <ref> [9] </ref> on a single reduced word. <p> In particular, if w is vexillary, F w = Q B (w) : (15) 17 Proof: Using the notation from the algorithm above, one sees that U corresponds to a reduced word a of u under the B n -Edelman-Greene correspondence (a.k.a. Haiman correspondance) <ref> [9] </ref>. Also V corresponds to a reduced word b of v under the A n -Edelman-Greene correspondence. Then ab is a reduced word of w. The steps described above give a sequence of shifted jeu de taquin moves for the Haiman procedures on ab.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The vexillary permutations in the symmetric group have interesting connections with the number of reduced words, the Littlewood-Richardson rule, Stanley symmetric functions, Schubert polynomials and the Schubert calculus. Lascoux and Schutzenberger <ref> [16] </ref> have shown that vexillary permutations are characterized by the property that they avoid any subsequence of length 4 with the same relative order as 2143. Macdonald has given a good overview of vexillary permutations in [18]. <p> For S n , this definition is equivalent to the original definition of vexillary given by Lascoux and Schutzenberger in <ref> [16] </ref>. They showed that vexillary permutations w are characterized by the condition that no subsequence a &lt; b &lt; c &lt; d exists such that w b &lt; w a &lt; w d &lt; w c . This property is usually referred to as 2143-avoiding.

Macdonald has given a good overview of vexillary permutations in <ref> [18] </ref>. In this paper we propose a definition for vexillary elements in the hyperoc 2 tahedral group. We show that the vexillary elements can again be determined by pattern avoidance conditions. We will begin by reviewing the history of the Stanley symmetric functions and establishing our notation. <p> Again the proof relies on a computer verification that these patterns characterize all vexillary elements in B 6 and D 6 . 4. A rule for multiplication Lascoux and Schutzenberger noticed that the transition equation for Schubert polynomials of vexillary permutations can be used to multiply Schur functions <ref> [18, p.62] </ref>. 13 This provides an alternative to the Littlewood-Richardson rule. There is an analog of Littlewood-Richardson rule that can be used to multiply Schur Q-functions [25, 30]. L. <p> a vexillary element w, for which straight shape does G w = s if w 2 S 1 ?
