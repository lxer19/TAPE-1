Abstract: This paper presents an approach to distributed optimisation applied to the problem of teaching space utilisation in a college. We describe the basic ingredients of the problem and analyse various solutions, some produced in a centralised environment and some in a distributed environment. The main aim is to investigate how distributed optimisation may be formulated. In particular we introduce a "broker"-based approach for interdepartmental sharing of resources, with a view to finding a reasonable compromise between allowing a degree of autonomy for individual departments and optimising the global usage of resources at the college level. Various results of the experiments based on different optimisation criteria and heuristics are presented and analysed.

Reference-contexts: The main concern in this paper is directed towards integrating different optimisation criteria in a distributed environment. To date we have developed a timetabling scheduler for departmental use [4, 5] and a simulation environment for distributed optimisation for multi-agent planning and scheduling <ref> [1] </ref>. The system is implemented in the constraint logic programming language ECL i PS e . We have carried out a series of experiments to investigate how the resources in the distributed TSU environment can be more "optimally" utilised. The paper is organised as follows.
