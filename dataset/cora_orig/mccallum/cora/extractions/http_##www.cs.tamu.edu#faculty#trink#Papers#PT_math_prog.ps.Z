Abstract: Dedication. It gives us great pleasure to dedicate this paper to Professor Richard W. Cottle for his sixtieth birthday on 29 June 1994. Professor Cottle is the founder of the linear complementarity problem. This paper is motivated by an engineering application; like many such applications, complementarity plays a central role in the problem formulation, analysis, and solution. We are indebted to Professor Cottle for the fundamental contributions he has made in this field, for his constant encouragement, advice, and fruitful collaboration over many years. Without his help and guidance, this work would not have been possible.

Reference-contexts: The crux of the difficulty in planning, is that the multi-rigid-body contact model (for a given input) 2 does not always have a solution, and when it does, it may not be unique <ref> [17, 3] </ref>. Therefore, plans generated using the model may not accomplish the goal when executed by corresponding real robot system. As in several previous studies of this problem [17, 3], we focus our attention on the situation in which there are no impacts occurring at the time for which the contact <p> contact model (for a given input) 2 does not always have a solution, and when it does, it may not be unique <ref> [17, 3] </ref>. Therefore, plans generated using the model may not accomplish the goal when executed by corresponding real robot system. As in several previous studies of this problem [17, 3], we focus our attention on the situation in which there are no impacts occurring at the time for which the contact problem is formulated (i.e., the current time). <p> Nonetheless, the reader should be aware that even though no impacts are occurring at the current time, our model could predict consistent impulsive contact forces. Indeed, as suggested by Baraff <ref> [3] </ref> in the 2-dimensional case, when a Lemke-like algorithm is applied to a linear complementarity formulation of the contact problem, termination on an unbounded ray could be interpreted as an impulse. <p> in the same way as the original version; we will focus on the treatment of the latter only, (i.e., the case for which ff = f1; : : : ; n g) . 3 Complementarity Formulations It is known that many contact problems can be formulated as complementarity problems; see <ref> [1, 3, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 30] </ref>. While the model with Coulomb friction cones described above does not lend itself to a standard nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) formulation, the friction pyramid model can be formulated as a standard LCP [6]. <p> In what follows, we propose a relaxed friction model similar to those used by Lotstedt and Baraff <ref> [3] </ref>, and study the question of existence of solution. In particular, the relaxed model is formed by replacing equation (9), by the inequality: v it c it + v io c io 0. <p> We point out that existence results subsume all previous results known to us. Specifically, Baraff has proved that a 3-dimensional system with one contact point that is rolling has a solution <ref> [3] </ref>. Also, specializing our results to the planar case yields results consistent with and more general than the results given by Rajan et al. [28] and Erdmann [8] who studied a single moving object in contact with immovable objects.

Reference-contexts: The objective of this paper is to introduce several useful complementarity formulations of the multi-rigid-body contact problem with Coulomb friction, to present a previously unknown existence result for the all-rolling problem using a theory of quasi-variational inequalities <ref> [5] </ref>, and to discuss a complementarity constrained least-squares formulation for the general rolling-sliding problem. Our results provide strict theoretical guidelines for the applicability of the models, and thus are of great importance in automatic task planning, and more generally in the field of rigid body mechanics. <p> Moreover, by the convexity of SOL (c t ; c o ), it is not hard to show that K (c t ; c o ) is convex. As defined in <ref> [5] </ref>, the quasi-variational inequality (QVI) associated with the pair (K; F ) is the problem of finding a pair (c t ; c o ) 2 K (c t ; c 0 ) such that F (c t ; c 0 ) T c 0 c 0 # t ; c <p> Hence K is lower semicontinuous, and thus continuous, at (c t ; c o ). Q.E.D. Applying Corollary 4.1 in <ref> [5] </ref>, we have our first existence result for the all-rolling contact problem with Coulomb friction cones. Theorem 4 If the matrix A is positive definite, then the QVI (K; F ) has a solution; thus so does the all-rolling 3-dimensional multi-rigid-body contact problem with Coulomb friction cone constraints. Proof.

Reference-contexts: While the model with Coulomb friction cones described above does not lend itself to a standard nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) formulation, the friction pyramid model can be formulated as a standard LCP <ref> [6] </ref>. The starting point in obtaining a complementarity formulation for both the friction cone and pyramid models is to eliminate the acceleration vectors of the object and the joints, q and , via the equations (1) and (2). <p> In principle, the LCP stated in Theorem 1 is amenable to numerical so lution by the well-known Lemke's almost complementary pivotal algorithm. Nevertheless, the results pertaining to the ray termination of this algorithm as summarized in <ref> [6, Section 4.4] </ref> are not applicable. Indeed, the matrix M 12 of this LCP does not seem to belong to any known class of matrices existing in the linear complementarity literature. <p> We call this the all-rolling problem. The analysis in this section makes use of some basic results from linear complementarity theory; the reader is referred 15 to <ref> [6] </ref> for a comprehensive study of the linear complementarity problem. Re--sults pertaining to the LCP with a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix are most relevant below; see Section 3.1 in the cited book for a summary of these background results. <p> problem reduces to the standard LCP: a n = A nn c n + b n 0; c n 0; (a n ) T c n = 0; (37) with the matrix A nn and vector b n given in (21) and (22) respectively, it follows from elementary LCP theory <ref> [6, Section 3.1] </ref> that (37) has a solution if and only if the implication (36) holds. Returning to the all-rolling problem with positive friction coefficients, we note that the implication (36) remains valid under the assumption (35). <p> We shall first treat the case where the matrix A is positive definite. As noted in the proof of Theorem 3, SOL (c t ; c o ) is a singleton, which we denote fc n (c t ; c 0 )g. According to Lemma 7.3.10 in <ref> [6] </ref>, c n (c t ; c o ) is Lipschitz continuous in the argument (c t ; c o ). <p> Yet the proof of Theorem 6 relies on QVI theory; this is different from the way many known LCP existence results are derived, namely, from the theory of variational inequalities <ref> [6, Chapter 3] </ref>. 5 The Rolling-Sliding Case When some contacts are initially sliding, that is, when S 6= ;, the multi-rigid-body contact problem, with either the friction cone or friction pyramid constraints, need not have a solution.

Reference-contexts: When tasks do not involve contact (e.g., paint-spraying) planning is well understood and provably good planning algorithms exist for several classes of problems [16]. However, tasks involving contact between the robot and its surroundings (e.g., grasping tasks) are more difficult to plan <ref> [9, 23] </ref>. When contact interactions (e.g., rolling, sliding, or breaking) must change during task execution, the planning problems are even more difficult. (e.g., mechanical assembly and dexterous manipulation tasks).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the main goals of the robotics research community is to automate the planning of tasks to be carried out by robots. When tasks do not involve contact (e.g., paint-spraying) planning is well understood and provably good planning algorithms exist for several classes of problems <ref> [16] </ref>. However, tasks involving contact between the robot and its surroundings (e.g., grasping tasks) are more difficult to plan [9, 23]. When contact interactions (e.g., rolling, sliding, or breaking) must change during task execution, the planning problems are even more difficult. (e.g., mechanical assembly and dexterous manipulation tasks).

This is a failing of the model, because any physical system and situation that we are interested in has a solution in the real world.

Reference-contexts: Collisions are assumed to be dealt with as they arise by an appropriate impulse-momentum model, such as the ones studied by Seyfferth and Pfeiffer <ref> [30] </ref>, Marques [21], Moreau [22], and Paoli [27]. Nonetheless, the reader should be aware that even though no impacts are occurring at the current time, our model could predict consistent impulsive contact forces. <p> in the same way as the original version; we will focus on the treatment of the latter only, (i.e., the case for which ff = f1; : : : ; n g) . 3 Complementarity Formulations It is known that many contact problems can be formulated as complementarity problems; see <ref> [1, 3, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 30] </ref>. While the model with Coulomb friction cones described above does not lend itself to a standard nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) formulation, the friction pyramid model can be formulated as a standard LCP [6].

Reference-contexts: Our results provide strict theoretical guidelines for the applicability of the models, and thus are of great importance in automatic task planning, and more generally in the field of rigid body mechanics. The treatment in this paper is purely analytical; in the accompanying paper <ref> [31] </ref>, we shall report the numerical results of solving the multi-rigid-body contact problem using the various complementarity formulations introduced herein. 2 The Multi-Rigid-Body Contact Model We refer the reader to [31] for the detailed physical description of the multi-rigid-body contact model with Coulomb friction considered here. <p> The treatment in this paper is purely analytical; in the accompanying paper <ref> [31] </ref>, we shall report the numerical results of solving the multi-rigid-body contact problem using the various complementarity formulations introduced herein. 2 The Multi-Rigid-Body Contact Model We refer the reader to [31] for the detailed physical description of the multi-rigid-body contact model with Coulomb friction considered here. In this section, we shall summarize the governing equations of the model and indicate how one can replace Coulomb's nonlinear law with a linear friction pyramid law. <p> As a consequence, while Lemke's algorithm may find a solution, it is not guaranteed to do so whenever a solution exists. In the accompanying paper <ref> [31] </ref>, we have obtained sufficient conditions on the data of the model which ensure the successful termination of Lemke's algorithm for computing a solution of this LCP. The model with Coulomb's law We consider applying Coulomb's law (i.e., the friction cone law) at the rolling contacts. <p> Several theoretical questions remain open. One of these is the existence of an optimal solution to the least-squares model (46). In this paper, we have not discussed any numerical aspect of the models; these and other engineering issues as well as further existence results are discussed in the paper <ref> [31] </ref>. 7 Acknowledgements The authors would like to express their gratitude to Sandra Sudarsky and Grace Lo for their contributions to this work in general.
