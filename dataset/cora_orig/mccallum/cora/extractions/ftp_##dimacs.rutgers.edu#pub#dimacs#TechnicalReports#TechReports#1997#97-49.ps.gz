Reference-contexts: Such a sub-function is called a restriction of f.) An interesting new proof of the Switching Lemma was presented by [Raz95] (see also <ref> [FL95, AAR] </ref>), and further extensions were presented by [Bea], the latter motivated in particular by the usefulness of the Switching Lemma as a tool in proving bounds on the length of propositional proofs. <p> Thus we lose nothing of practical importance if we re-define all notions of NP-completeness and completeness for other classes solely in terms of AC 0 reductions. Here are two rather startling facts about complete sets under AC 0 reducibility. - 11 - Theorem 9.1 <ref> [AAR] </ref> Let C be any complexity class closed under TC 0 reductions. (Thus C can be P or NP or NC 1 or PP, etc.) 1. All sets complete for C under AC 0 reductions are complete under NC 0 reductions. 2.

(These are so-called MAJ + circuits, also called (generalized) perceptrons.) A sequence of papers including <ref> [ABFR94, Bei94] </ref> led to the result that an AND, OR, NOT circuit with n o (1) MAJORITY gates can be "efficiently" simulated by depth two circuits with a single MAJORITY gate at the output, with small - 6 - fan-in AND gates at the input level.

Reference-contexts: Arguably the most natural notion of completeness for classes such as these is the notion given by AC 0 many-one reductions. In fact, as was pointed out by <ref> [AG91] </ref>, the first time AC 0 was studied in complexity theory was precisely for this purpose [Jon75]. Also, the first-order translations of Immerman [Imm87] (which provide a notion of completeness defined entirely in terms of logic) correspond to AC 0 reductions.

Reference-contexts: TC 0 circuits. (Similarly, although we don't know if DTIME (2 n ) has polynomial-size circuits, it is easy to show that it requires exponential-size uniform circuits.) Can we improve on these trivial bounds? The first paper to make explicit use of uniformity in proving a circuit lower bound was <ref> [AG94] </ref>. There, we showed that computing the permanent of a matrix requires size at least 2 n * on ACC 0 circuits. <p> If T (T (n)) &lt; 2 n , then a complete set for PP requires more than size T (n) to compute on uniform ACC 0 circuits. (In <ref> [AG94] </ref> this is called a sub-subexponential size bound. Note that this is still much larger than, say, n log n .) No lower bounds for uniform TC 0 were presented in [AG94]. <p> a complete set for PP requires more than size T (n) to compute on uniform ACC 0 circuits. (In <ref> [AG94] </ref> this is called a sub-subexponential size bound. Note that this is still much larger than, say, n log n .) No lower bounds for uniform TC 0 were presented in [AG94]. <p> Note that, although this size bound is smaller than the bound in <ref> [AG94] </ref>, it is for a more powerful class of circuits. An obvious question is whether these bounds can be improved.

Reference-contexts: Nonetheless, a notion of measure on P that generalizes Lutz's notion was defined in <ref> [AS94] </ref>, thus successfully overcoming this first obstacle. <p> for AC 0 , Cai, Sivakumar, and Strauss [CSS, Siv96] succeeded in showing that not only is NTIME (log n) a measure zero subset of P, but in fact all of AC 0 has measure zero in P (using a notion of measure that differs only slightly from that of <ref> [AS94] </ref>). This is the most exciting application of resource - 10 - bounded measure on P thus far, and it also gives cause to reconsider how likely it is that NP is a measure zero subset of DTIME (2 n O (1) ).

Reference-contexts: 0 lacks the ability to compute pseudorandom function generators for general polynomial-time computations; this was proved in [LMN93] as a corollary to their main results analyzing the Fourier spectrum of AC 0 functions. (This relates to one of the many ways of representing functions by polynomials; for a survey, see <ref> [Bei93] </ref>.) 4 Toward ACC 0 0 Algbraic considerations are what led to ACC 0 being identified as an object of study, and algebraic tools are what led to the lower bounds for the classes AC 0 (p) that form the basic building blocks of ACC 0 . <p> We refer the reader to the survey by Beigel <ref> [Bei93] </ref> for better coverage of this topic. Here, we will pick out only a few ideas and recent developments. Most work on simulating circuits by polynomials concentrates on the degree of the polynomial as the relevant measure of complexity.

Reference-contexts: Recall that deterministic space complexity is roughly the same as alternating time complexity [CKS81]. It turns out that the full power of alternation is not needed to obtain sets outside of P/poly two alternations suffice, as can be shown using techniques of [Kan82] (see also <ref> [BH92] </ref>). Combined with Toda's theorem [Tod91] we obtain the following. Theorem 1.2 [Kan82, BH92, Tod91] Let T be a time-constructible superpolynomial func tion.

Reference-contexts: AC 0 is the class of problems solvable by polynomial-size, constant-depth circuits of AND, OR, and NOT gates of unbounded fan-in. AC 0 corresponds to O (1)-time computation on a parallel computer, and it also consists exactly of the languages that can be specified in first-order logic <ref> [Imm89, BIS90] </ref>. AC 0 circuits are powerful enough to add and subtract n-bit numbers. 2. NC 1 is the class of problems solvable by circuits of AND, OR, and NOT gates of fan-in two and depth O (log n). <p> Finally, it is appropriate to mention two other streams of work that may be viewed as initial steps for proving circuit lower bounds (although they do not explicitly yield circuit bounds in their current forms). TC 0 can be characterized in terms of first-order logic with counting quantifiers <ref> [BIS90] </ref>. Work such as that of Etessami on non-expressibility [Ete] can be viewed as providing a limited circuit lower bound. <p> This problem can be side-stepped by considering only uniform families of circuits; circuit family fC n g is uniform if there is an efficient algorithm for the mapping n 7! C n . We will follow the lead of <ref> [BIS90] </ref> and use "Dlogtime" uniformity. (For the purposes of this survey it will not be necessary to deal with the details of the definition of the uniformity condition.) Since uniform TC 0 is contained in DSPACE (log n) 6= PSPACE, it is easy to show that the standard PSPACE-complete sets require

Reference-contexts: for NC 1 . 3 AC A dramatic series of papers in the 1980's [Ajt83, FSS84, Cai89, Yao85, H-as87] gave us a proof that AC 0 circuits require exponential size even to determine if the number of 1's in the input is odd or even. (See also the excellent tutorial <ref> [BS90] </ref>.) The main tool in proving this and other lower bounds for AC 0 is H-astad's Switching Lemma, one version of which states that most of the "sub-functions" of any AC 0 function f are in NC 0 . (A sub-function of f is obtained by setting most of the n <p> polynomial over GFp having degree log O (1) n) that agrees with the original circuit on a large number of inputs. * The MODm function cannot agree with any low-degree polynomial over GFp ` on very many inputs (for any constant `). (Also see the presentation of Smolensky's proof in <ref> [BS90] </ref>. A very different proof was later published, again by Smolensky [Smo93].) It is encouraging that something very like the depth-reduction to depth two circuits holds also for all of ACC 0 .

Reference-contexts: This simulation, combined with arguments about the degree required to compute the MOD2 function (even approximately), shows that any AND, OR, NOT circuit with n o (1) MAJORITY gates requires exponential size to compute MOD2. Barrington and Straubing <ref> [BS94] </ref> generalize this to MODm for any m. 5.2 The Surprising Power of Composite Moduli Several papers have shown senses in which MODm gates for composite m (m not a prime power) have more computational power than MODp gates for prime p. <p> This bound is improved in [Tsa96] and again by Green in [Gre]. Green uses this bound to partially extend the lower bounds of <ref> [BS94] </ref>, showing that the MODq function requires exponential size to compute on depth three circuits with an exact threshold gate at the output, MODp gates on the middle level, and small-fan-in AND gates at the inputs. 5.3 Solvability versus Nonsolvability Another body of lower bounds comes directly from the algebraic characterization

Reference-contexts: Finally, a different sort of bound on the complexity of computing the AND with MOD - 7 - gates is given by [The], who shows that such circuits must have at least a linear number of gates on the input level. (It is appropriate to also mention <ref> [BS95] </ref>, which does not provide a circuit lower bound per se, but does provide a nonlinear bound on the ACC 0 formula size, using algebraic techniques.) 5.4 Low Levels of the TC 0 Hierarchy The first important lower bound for threshold circuits is still one of the best.

Reference-contexts: A natural conjecture is that these circuits cannot compute the AND function (just as AC 0 circuits cannot compute MOD6). The first lower bounds in this direction appear in <ref> [BST90] </ref>, where the authors show that programs over a particular class of groups need exponential size in order to compute the AND function. This is translated into a lower bound for a certain kind of depth two circuits of MOD gates by Caussinus [Cau96, Cau].

Reference-contexts: In the algebraic theory mentioned above, ACC 0 corresponds to computation over any solvable algebra <ref> [BT88] </ref>. Thus in the algebraic theory, ACC 0 is the most natural subclass of NC 1 . 4. TC 0 is the class of problems solvable by polynomial-size, constant-depth threshold circuits. TC 0 captures exactly the complexity of integer multiplication and division, and sorting [CSV84].

Reference-contexts: Where can we find sets that are not in P/poly? A straightforward diagonalization shows that for any superpolynomial time-bound T , there is a problem in DSPACE (T (n)) P/poly. Recall that deterministic space complexity is roughly the same as alternating time complexity <ref> [CKS81] </ref>. It turns out that the full power of alternation is not needed to obtain sets outside of P/poly two alternations suffice, as can be shown using techniques of [Kan82] (see also [BH92]). Combined with Toda's theorem [Tod91] we obtain the following.

Reference-contexts: Nonetheless, a notion of measure on P that generalizes Lutz's notion was defined in [AS94], thus successfully overcoming this first obstacle. Using many techniques developed for proving lower bounds for AC 0 , Cai, Sivakumar, and Strauss <ref> [CSS, Siv96] </ref> succeeded in showing that not only is NTIME (log n) a measure zero subset of P, but in fact all of AC 0 has measure zero in P (using a notion of measure that differs only slightly from that of [AS94]). <p> There are also results (using a slightly different notion of measure) showing that AC 0 (2) does not have P-measure zero [Siv96]. Since the Nisan-Wigderson pseudorandom generator is an important tool in proving the measure zero result of <ref> [CSS] </ref>, it is tempting to speculate that there is a connection between these contrasting measure results for AC 0 and AC 0 (2), and our inability thus far to construct pseudorandom generators for AC 0 (2).

Reference-contexts: Thus in the algebraic theory, ACC 0 is the most natural subclass of NC 1 . 4. TC 0 is the class of problems solvable by polynomial-size, constant-depth threshold circuits.

Also, TC 0 is a good complexity-theoretic model for "neural net" computation [PS88, PS89]. 5.

Razborov and Rudich formulate a notion of lower bound proof that is general enough to include all of the papers dealing with constant-depth circuits cited in the preceding sections. <p> But cryptographers believe that there are cryptographically secure functions computable in TC 0 [IN89]. 3 If they are right, then <ref> [RR94] </ref> shows that any proof showing TC 0 6= NP must look quite unlike any circuit lower bound proof that has been seen yet: an "unnatural" proof.

Rather, it should serve as a guide indicating which approaches to rule out. Certainly, many complexity theoreticians are trying to formulate arguments that avoid the problems faced by Natural Proofs. <p> Finally, it is interesting to note that Lutz's notion of measure is actually quite closely related to notion of Natural Proof presented by <ref> [RR94] </ref>; it was shown in [RSC95] that the existence of a natural proof showing that a problem is not in some class C corresponds (roughly) to an argument that the class C is a "small" complexity class in the sense of resource-bounded measure.

Reference-contexts: As we shall see below, weak lower bounds have been proven for ACC 0 and TC 0 , whereas almost nothing is known for NC 1 . 3 AC A dramatic series of papers in the 1980's <ref> [Ajt83, FSS84, Cai89, Yao85, H-as87] </ref> gave us a proof that AC 0 circuits require exponential size even to determine if the number of 1's in the input is odd or even. (See also the excellent tutorial [BS90].) The main tool in proving this and other lower bounds for AC 0 is

Reference-contexts: A very different proof was later published, again by Smolensky [Smo93].) It is encouraging that something very like the depth-reduction to depth two circuits holds also for all of ACC 0 . The results of <ref> [Yao90, BT94] </ref> show that every set in ACC 0 is recognized 2 Since so many theorems about constant-depth circuits provide simulating circuits of "quasipolynomial" size (that is, size 2 log O (1) n ), Barrington has given a framework where quasipolynomial circuit size is studied, instead of polynomial size [Bar92]. - <p> There, we showed that computing the permanent of a matrix requires size at least 2 n * on ACC 0 circuits. The proof combines the circuit simulations of <ref> [Yao90, BT94] </ref> with 3 This is perhaps the appropriate place to mention that it has been conjectured that TC 0 is in fact equal to NC 1 [IL95].

Reference-contexts: This is translated into a lower bound for a certain kind of depth two circuits of MOD gates by Caussinus [Cau96, Cau]. A related lower bound is provided by <ref> [YP94] </ref>, showing that a class of restricted depth three circuits also cannot compute the AND.

Reference-contexts: This bound is shown to be optimal in <ref> [ZBT93] </ref>, where a characterization of the symmetric functions computed by MAJ + circuits is given. This simulation, combined with arguments about the degree required to compute the MOD2 function (even approximately), shows that any AND, OR, NOT circuit with n o (1) MAJORITY gates requires exponential size to compute MOD2.
