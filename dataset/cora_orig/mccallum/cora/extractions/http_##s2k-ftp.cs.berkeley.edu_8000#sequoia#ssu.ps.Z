Abstract: Project Sequoia will make use of a large number of computers, so many that if they aren't managed carefully and consistently the goals of the project could be threatened. With this in mind, this document describes the computing environment in which Sequoia researchers at UC Berkeley will operate. Most of the features of this environment are based on comments from members of the Postgres research group, which has been using a similar environment for quite a while *. SSU obviously assumes that the machines in its computing environment will be DEC machines running Ultrix. This is not to slight other manufacturers but, given DEC's generous financial contribution, other options aren't financially viable. On the other hand, existing non-DEC hardware can interact with SSU machines but the non-DEC hardware should not assume that all the features of SSU will be present. Project Sequoia will have 2 fast server machines, called HEEL and TOE. T hese servers will be DECSystem 5900's and they will each have 128Mb of RAM, 10 1.3Gb RZ58 disk drives, Prestoserve, 1 8mm backup device, and a CD-ROM reader. Other backup media, such as 4mm and 9-track tape, will be added as needed. These servers will be configured with very large disk caches. Interactive use of these servers will be discouraged. Each workstation will have a minimum of 32Mb of RAM and a local disk of at least 600Mb. S ince most Sequoia researchers will use visualization tools, most workstations will include at least 8-bit color graphics using a 16" or 19" 72Hz color monitor. Researchers needing more graphics capabilities can order the various accelerators. All systems at Berkeley will be connected by FDDI. There will be adequate control of the routing tables on all workstations to insure that routing loops do not occur. Routing to ethernets will be accomplished by a designated router on the FDDI net. More information on Sequoia network configuration will be sent out to system managers as the information becomes available.
