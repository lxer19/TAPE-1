Abstract: Multimedia applications require a guaranteed level of service for accessing Continuous Media (CM) data, such as video and audio. To obtain such guarantees, the database server where the data is residing must employ an admission control scheme to limit the number of clients that can be served concurrently. We investigate the problem of on-line admission control where the decision on whether to accept or reject a request must be made without any knowledge about future requests. Employing competitive analysis techniques, we address the problem in its most general form with the following key contributions: (1) we prove a tight upper bound on the competitive ratio of the conventional Work-Conserving (WC) policy, showing that it is within a factor 1+ 1 of the optimal clairvoyant strategy that knows the entire request sequence in advance, where is the ratio of the maximum to minimum request length (that is, time duration), and is the maximum fraction of the server's bandwidth that a request can demand; (2) we prove a lower bound of ( log 1 ) on the competitive ratio of any deterministic or randomized admission control scheme, demonstrating an exponential gap between greedy and optimal on-line solutions; (3) we propose simple deterministic schemes based on the idea of bandwidth prepartitioning that guarantee competitive ratios within a small constant factor of log (i.e., they are near-optimal ) for sufficiently large server bandwidth; (4) we introduce a novel admission control policy that partitions the server bandwidth based on the expected popularities of different request lengths and present a set of preliminary experimental results that demonstrate the benefits of our policy compared to WC. We believe that our results offer new insights to other optimization problems that arise in CM data management, including data placement and load balancing in distributed CM databases.

Reference-contexts: Our proposed schemes also employ the idea of on-line classification, but they also are completely deterministic with 2 out compromising near-optimal competitiveness (for suffi-ciently large server bandwidth). Awerbuch et al. <ref> [3] </ref> consider non-preemptive circuit routing on general networks. <p> Then: (1) Any deterministic on-line admission control algorithm has a competitive ratio of (a) ( (1+) 2 ; and, 1 ), otherwise. (2) Any randomized on-line admission control algorithm has a competitive ratio of ( log 1 ) , if 1 We should note that Awerbuch et al. <ref> [3] </ref> also proved an (log ) lower bound for deterministic on-line circuit routing in the case of requests with identical bandwidth requirements. However, our lower bounds for the more general variable bandwidth case also demonstrate the effect of the maximum bandwidth demand () which was not factored into their results.

Reference-contexts: These assumptions severely limit the applicability of their results to general CM servers. There is also a significant body of related work in the field of on-line algorithms for bandwidth allocation and circuit routing in communication networks. Lipton and Tomkins <ref> [21] </ref> study the competitiveness of randomized strategies for the non-preemptive On-line Interval Scheduling (OIS) problem, which essentially corresponds to on-line admission control in a server that can support a single playback stream. <p> Corollary 4.1 If B r max +r min then WC is 1+ 1 -compe titive, where = r max B . 2 Note that, in this case, maximizing throughput is equivalent to maximizing total scheduled request length <ref> [21] </ref>. 3 Note that the competitiveness bound of 1+ 1 is, in fact, valid regardless of the relative sizes of B and r max + r min . Theorem 4.2 just gives a tighter bound when B &lt; r max + r min . <p> We propose such schemes with near-optimal competitiveness in Section 4.3. Once again, let us start with the identical bandwidth case (i.e., r i = r for all i). A simple adversary argument shows that for the case of a single bandwidth channel (i.e., the OIS problem <ref> [21] </ref>), there is a lower bound of 1 + on the competitiveness of any deterministic scheduler. This argument fails when the number of channels is increased. However, as the following theorem shows, no deterministic or randomized admission control scheme can be better than (log ) competitive.

Reference-contexts: Roughly speaking, the main idea is to assign each edge a "length" that is exponential in its current load and route an incoming circuit only if the length of the shortest routing path is less than the "benefit" associated with the circuit. However, as reported by Plotkin <ref> [28] </ref> and Gawlick [18], Route or Block exhibited consistently poor performance in an actual implementation. Ad-hoc changes in the algorithm's parameters were necessary to improve its behavior.

Reference-contexts: Also, note that for typical CM numbers the fraction is much smaller than unity. For example, even for the relatively high MPEG-2 rate requirements of 6-8 Mbps, a CM server with a low-end RAID can sustain 40-60 concurrent streams <ref> [26, 31] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Prior work [11, 34] has explored the use of techniques such as dynamic stream re-assignments and dynamic replica creation/coalescing only within ad-hoc schemes, without providing any strong performance guarantees or exploiting the wealth of theoretical results on on-line load balancing (see, for example, <ref> [2, 5, 6, 32] </ref>). Finally, incorporating the concept of equivalent bandwidth into our on-line analysis is another interesting problem. Equivalent bandwidth is fundamental for providing sessions with statistical performance guarantees.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we should note that allowing preemption of requests can lead to better competitive ratios for on-line scheduling and admission control problems <ref> [7, 9, 14, 15, 20, 33] </ref>. However, the assumption of preemptability is unrealistic in the context of CM applications. 3 Problem Formulation We view a CM database server as a "black box" capable of offering a sustained bandwidth capacity of B.

However, little attention has been paid in the multimedia literature to the on-line nature of the admission control problem for CM database servers. <p> Traditionally, the goal of data placement schemes in this setting is to balance the expected bandwidth load (according to the popularities fp i g) across the available servers under the given server storage constraints <ref> [11, 22, 34] </ref>. This model of "popularity-based data placement" aims at achieving good system utilization and balanced system load in an average sense. <p> As another example, the placement policy should try to replicate short clips across many servers, so that there are many possibilities of dynamically re-assigning (e.g., using a baton passing primitive <ref> [34] </ref>) streams delivering these clips to different servers. This obviously reduces the probability of a short request causing the rejection of a long request from the system, which is the worst-case scenario in all our competitiveness results. <p> Second, we plan to use our results and methodology as a starting step towards a formal study of dynamic on-line load balancing in multimedia storage servers.

Reference-contexts: In most of our experiments, the request lengths were sampled from a discrete set of values between 5 and 150 minutes, with sampling probabilities (i.e., popularities) taken from a Zipfian distribution with skew parameter z <ref> [35] </ref>. We varied this skew parameter from 0.0 (uniform) to 2.0 (very skewed). Results were obtained for three different models of correlation between request lengths and popularities: * Positive. Larger popularities are assigned to longer requests. * Negative. Larger popularities are assigned to shorter requests. * Random.
