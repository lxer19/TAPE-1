Title: Image Segmentation Using Local Variation

Abstract: We present a new graph-theoretic approach to the problem of image segmentation. Our method uses local criteria and yet produces results that reflect global properties of the image. We develop a framework that provides specific definitions of what it means for an image to be under- or over-segmented. We then present an efficient algorithm for computing a segmentation that is neither under- nor over-segmented according to these definitions. Our segmentation criterion is based on intensity differences between neighboring pixels. An important characteristic of the approach is that it is able to preserve detail in low-variability regions while ignoring detail in high-variability regions, which we illustrate with several examples on both real and sythetic images.

Reference-contexts: Then by Lemma 1 C s = C q1 q1 t , implying that o q 62 E C , which is a contradiction. Thus the second condition in Step 3 has no effect when considering edges in E C , so Algorithm 1 is following Kruskal's algorithm (cf. <ref> [1] </ref>) for computing the minimum spanning tree of the edges ordered by the indices (Kruskal's algorithm considers the edges ordered by weight, adding an edge to the minimum spanning tree when it connects two vertices that are not yet connected by any path.) 4 Theorem 1 Given F produced by Algorithm <p> If D j1 s = D t this is trivially true. 4 Implementation and Results The implementation maintains the segmentation S using a disjoint-set forest with union by rank and path compression (cf. <ref> [1] </ref>). The running time of the algorithm can be factored into two parts. First in Step 0, it is necessary to sort the weights into non-decreasing order. For integer weights this can be done in linear 5 time using counting sort.

Reference-contexts: There is a large literature on segmentation and clustering (cf. <ref> [2] </ref>). Many segmentation methods assume that the image is piecewise constant, and thus produce somewhat arbitrary results for slow intensity gradients due to lighting and slanted surfaces.

Reference-contexts: This approach to segmentation captures nonlocal properties of the image, in contrast with the more efficient methods described above. Finally, there are a number of methods that use sophisticated models, such as those based on Markov Random Fields (e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>), but these methods tend to be quite inefficient. In our view, the two main goals for an image segmentation algorithm are to capture non-local properties of the image and to be efficient to compute.

Reference-contexts: For example, such methods would break the intensity ramp in Figure 1 into multiple regions so that each region meets the assumption of nearly constant intensity. The same problem arises with clustering methods that are based on finding compact (small radius) clusters in some intensity-based feature space (e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>), because such methods implicitly find nearly constant intensity regions. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem. In such approaches each node of the graph corresponds to a pixel of the image.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm uses a greedy decision criterion to merge regions based on these measures, yielding a method that runs in time nearly linear in the number of image pixels. As in the work of <ref> [5] </ref>, we believe it is important that segmentation algorithms take into account non-local properties of the image, because purely local properties fail to capture perceptually important differences in images. For instance, consider the synthetic im 1 age in Figure 1. <p> It is precisely this issue that motivates our approach, which aggregates a local measure of image variation over arbitrarily large regions of the image. Of those algorithms that require more than nearly linear time, one interesting class of methods are based on spectral partitioning techniques (e.g., <ref> [5, 8] </ref>). These methods operate by finding minimum cuts in the graph, where the cut criterion is designed to minimize the similarity between regions that are being split. This approach to segmentation captures nonlocal properties of the image, in contrast with the more efficient methods described above. <p> This efficiency is achieved by a bottom-up process that successively merges smaller components into larger ones. In <ref> [5] </ref> it is argued that in order to capture non-local image properties a segmentation algorithm should start with large image regions and split them, rather than starting with small image regions and merging them. <p> Color images are handled as three separate monochrome images, as discussed in Section 4. In graph-based approaches to image segmentation (e.g., <ref> [5, 8, 9] </ref>) the image is used to define an undirected graph H = (V; E), where each image pixel p i has a corresponding vertex v i 2 V , and an edge (v i ; v j ) 2 E connects vertices v i and v j . <p> Note that the algorithm does a good job of segmenting each of the three vehicles into components separate from the background while merging the road and grass areas into a small number of large components. Part e) of Figure 5 shows an image from <ref> [5] </ref> and f) shows the segmentation. Note that the field is all one component, and that the uniform of each player is primarily a single component. At the same time, many of the small but important components such as the arms and gloves are correctly segmented. <p> We note that these are properties of the final result of the algorithm, not properties of the individual decisions that the algorithm makes. This distinguishes our approach from previous segmentation methods, even those that make decisions based on global properties such as <ref> [5, 8] </ref>, because our algorithm makes decisions based on local properties, yet the resulting segmentation reflects global properties of the image.

Reference-contexts: The inadequacy of breaking large edges is apparent in region tend to be larger than any other weights. Zahn developed various heuristics to address such issues using models of weight distributions. The performance of these heuristics is difficult to characterize. The algorithm proposed in <ref> [6] </ref> uses a measure of local variability to decide which edges to break in partitioning the graph. This measure is based only on the nearest neighbors of each point. When applied to image segmentation problems, the nearest neighbors alone are not enough to get a reasonable measure of image variability.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The problems of image segmentation and grouping remain great challenges for computer vision. While it has been clear since the time of the Gestalt movement in psychology (e.g., <ref> [7] </ref>) that image-based segmentation and grouping play a powerful role in human visual perception, it has proven difficult to specify precise segmentation criteria and to develop efficient algorithms for computing segmentations that capture nonlocal properties of an image.
