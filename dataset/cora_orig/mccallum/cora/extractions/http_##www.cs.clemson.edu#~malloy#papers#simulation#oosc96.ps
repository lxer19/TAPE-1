Abstract: Table 3: This table compares the cpu time with the actual wall clock time required for both models. In the table, N is the traffic density and M is the mobility. time, where call completions have a higher priority than call arrivals. When a portable residing in a cell receives a call, a corresponding call completion event must be scheduled. If that portable than moves to another cell the call must be handed off. If no channel is available in the new cell the call is terminated; the terminated call requires that the previously scheduled call completion must be descheduled. We handle a terminated call by placing the CallCompletionEvent into a "cancelled" state. When an event in a cancelled state "occurs," nothing happens. To compare our wall clock timings with actual cpu time, we include Table 3. This table shows that our simulation program had little competition for the workstation resourses. PCS simulation is currently an important area of study. We have presented an extensible design for a PCS network and demonstrated that the design is extensible to modifications to the model. Our experiments indicate that the event-driven approach is a good match for PCS simulation and that our object-oriented design runs faster than a time-driven simulation of a PCS network.
