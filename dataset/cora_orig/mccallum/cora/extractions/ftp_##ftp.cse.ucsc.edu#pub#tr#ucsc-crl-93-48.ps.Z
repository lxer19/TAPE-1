Abstract: In this paper we present a procedure for reducing the probability of undetectable shorts occurring in routing channels. This procedure is implemented by modifying a channel router to predict many of the shorts that are undetectable and place the associated signal wires in non-adjacent tracks. For the designs we routed, we found that the probability of an undetectable non-feedback short between horizontal lines in the routing channels was reduced by 32.4% with no increase in the number of routing tracks required and little increase in routing computation cost.

Reference-contexts: For this paper, a short is undetectable if Nemesis can not generate a logic-level (static voltage testing) bridge fault that detects it. Note that some of the shorts we define as undetectable may be detected via excess I DDQ <ref> [Ack83] </ref> or propagation delay. We analyzed the undetectable shorts to find characteristics that would identify them with limited computational effort. We say that shorts that exhibit these characteristics are Locally Determinable (LD) as undetectable since one need only consider local circuit information to determine that they are undetectable.

Reference-contexts: An example is shown in Figure 2.2|assuming that an inverter-inverter short acts as a wired-AND, as it does in the standard cell library we are using. In order to collect our data, we used ten separate layouts of each of the ISCAS <ref> [BF85] </ref> combinational test circuits. The layouts were generated by TimberWolf [SSV85], a placement and global routing package, and a modified version of Yoeli's channel router [Yoe91]. We used the MCNC Standard Cell Library that comes with Oasis.

Reference-contexts: The layouts were generated by TimberWolf [SSV85], a placement and global routing package, and a modified version of Yoeli's channel router [Yoe91].

To determine the detectability of shorts within the layout, we used Carafe <ref> [JF93] </ref> to extract the set of likely shorts from the interconnect and Nemesis to generate tests for the shorts that Carafe extracted.

Reference-contexts: Other researchers have presented design rules that decrease the probability of occurrence of hard-to-detect faults by altering the physical layout of a circuit. Koeppe provided layout rules that decrease the likelihood of hard-to-detect stuck-open faults <ref> [Koe87] </ref>. Levitt and Abraham considered the problem of enhancing testability through the modification of cell layouts [LA90].

Teixeira et al. suggested dividing realistic faults into fault classes based upon their resistance to stuck-at test sets and recommended using the information to focus efforts on improving the detectability of hard to detect fault classes with large numbers of faults [TTA + 91].

Reference-contexts: Results are given for runs on over 100 layouts which show that the likelihood of an undetectable fault is substantially reduced with no silicon area overhead. Finally, we show how this work can be extended. 3 Analysis of Shorts in the Routing Channels We used the Nemesis <ref> [Lar92] </ref> ATPG system to generate tests and provide a list of all undetected non-feedback shorts. We considered only Non-Feedback (NFB) shorts as the system's handling of Feedback (FB) shorts is not yet accurate.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction For any given circuit, there are some defects that, should they occur, are likely to not be detected. Since shorts in the metal layers are the most common fault type in many CMOS technologies <ref> [MTCC87] </ref>, shorts in metal interconnect lines may represent a considerable portion of undetectable shorts. It would be beneficial to change the routing of cell interconnect to reduce the likelihood of such shorts occurring.

Reference-contexts: Saraiva et al., in a later related paper, advocated the use of routing to improve testability by relaxing the spacing between adjacent lines <ref> [SCS + 92] </ref>. Like Saraiva, we intend to modify the physical design of the wiring in the channel to eliminate undetectable shorts. The difference in our approach is that, instead of targeting a class of shorts that may be undetectable, we target shorts that are known to be undetectable.

A The Channel Router and its Modifications The channel router is a modified version of Uzi Yoeli's channel router <ref> [Yoe91] </ref>. The key feature of the channel router is that it places nets on a track by track basis.
