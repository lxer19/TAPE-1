Title: A Protocol for Seamless Communication in a Picocellular Network  
Author: Rohit Ghai and Suresh Singh 
Affiliation: University of South Carolina  
Abstract: In this paper we present an architecture for a picocellular network and present a novel communication protocol for mobile users in such networks. The cell size in these networks is very small typically of the order of a room in a building, resulting in an environment where the movement between cells is very rapid. This makes the problem of maintaining communication between a pair of mobile users non-trivial. Our communication protocol uses groups to maintain communication between two mobile users. Groups are special collections of picocells and represent regions where a mobile user is likely to be located in the near future. Thus, messages addressed to this mobile user are multicast to all the picocells in the group guaranteeing delivery and obviating the need for messages to be forwarded between picocells. The mobile users will therefore see lower delays in message delivery times.

The mobility of the nodes and the small size (in terms of storage space) of the hand-held devices make traditional solutions to network problems such as addressing, routing and flow-control inapplicable.

Reference-contexts: A picocellular network is similar to a microcellular network with the difference that the cell size is now of the order of 10 meters and is typically a room in a building (see <ref> [4, 8] </ref>). The advantage of a smaller cell size is higher throughput (because there will be fewer users per cell), greater frequency reuse (i.e., while adjacent cells use different radio frequencies, non-adjacent cells may use the same frequency) and low-power transmitters (resulting in longer battery life). <p> conclusions are presented in Section 6. 1.1 Literature review Problems associated with microcellular networks have been quite extensively studied in the literature.

We assume that every MH has a globally unique address regardless of where it is in the network as in <ref> [6] </ref>. The SH maintains the current location of every MH within its domain (i.e., its subnet). In addition, the SHs and MSSs together track the MHs as they move between cells. The MSSs are mainly responsible for flow-control and maintaining communication with all the MHs within its cell.
