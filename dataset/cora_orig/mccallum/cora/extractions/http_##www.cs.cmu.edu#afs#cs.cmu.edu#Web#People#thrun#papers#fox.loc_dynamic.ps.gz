Abstract: For mobile robots to be successful, they have to navigate safely in populated and dynamic environments. While recent research has led to a variety of localization methods that can track robots well in static environments, we still lack methods that can robustly localize mobile robots in dynamic environments, in which people block the robot's sensors for extensive periods of time or the position of furniture may change. This paper proposes extensions to Markov localization algorithms enabling them to localize mobile robots even in densely populated environments. Two different filters for determining the believability of sensor readings are employed. These filters are designed to detect sensor readings that are corrupted by humans or unexpected changes in the environment. The technique was recently implemented and applied as part of an installation, in which a mobile robot gave interactive tours to visitors of the Deutsches Museum Bonn. Extensive empirical tests involving datasets recorded during peak traffic hours in the museum demonstrate that this approach is able to accurately estimate the robot's position in more than 98% of the cases even in such highly dynamic environments.

Reference-contexts: Accurate localization is a key prerequisite for successful navigation in large-scale environments, particularly when global models are used, such as maps, drawings, topological descriptions, and CAD models (Kortenkamp, Bonasso, & Murphy 1998). As demonstrated by a recent survey of localization methods <ref> (Borenstein, Ev-erett, & Feng 1996) </ref>, the number of existing approaches is diverse. Mobile robot localization techniques can be categorized at least along the following two dimensions: local vs. global approaches, and approaches for static vs. dynamic environments: 1.

Reference-contexts: Like Markov localization, it localizes robots probabilistically, that is, it maintains multiple hypotheses as to where the robot might be, weighted by a numerical probability factor. As a consequence, our approach inherits from Markov localization the ability to localize a robot under global uncertainty (see <ref> (Burgard et al. 1996) </ref>). Markov localization is based on the assumption that the position of the robot is the only state in the world. Unfortunately, this assumption is violated if not all aspects of the environment are covered by the world model, which is the case for most dynamic environments. <p> In this paper we use a fine-grained grid-based representation of the state space, just like the approach described in <ref> (Burgard et al. 1996) </ref>. In all our experiments, the resolution of robot orientation was 2 ffi , and the spatial resolution was 15cm.

Reference-contexts: In an experimental study, our extended Markov localization is compared to the original Markov localization without filtering. These experiments are conducted using data gathered during a six-day deployment of our mobile robot RHINO in the Deutsches Museum Bonn shown in Figure 1 (a) (see also <ref> (Burgard et al. 1998) </ref>). Our comparisons show that in such situations, conventional Markov localization fails to track the robot's location. Our filter techniques, in contrast, successfully accommodate the environment's dynamics.

Reference-contexts: Bel (l) is then updated according to the following general formula coming from the domain of Markov chains <ref> (Chung 1960) </ref>: X P (l j l 0 ; a) Bel (l 0 ) (1) The term p (l j l 0 ; a) represents a model of the robot's kinematics. In our implementation we assume the errors of the odometry to be normally distributed.

Reference-contexts: The majority of existing localization approaches falls into this category. Global approaches are more general. They can localize a robot globally, that is, they can determine its location without knowledge of the initial location and thus can handle the kidnaped robot problem <ref> (Engelson 1994) </ref>. Recently, several researchers proposed a new localization paradigm, called Markov localization, which enables robots to localize themselves under global uncertainty.

Percentage of noisy sensor measurements. of the obstacles were invisible to the robot's sensors (such as glass cages, metal bars, staircases, and the alike). Only through accurate localization could collisions with those obstacles be avoided <ref> (Fox et al. 1998) </ref>. Using Markov localization with entropy filters, our approach led only to a single software-related collision, which involved an invisible obstacle and which was caused by a localization error that was slightly larger than a 30cm safety margin.

Reference-contexts: However, these approaches are typically brittle in environments where the dynamics are perceived through the robot's sensors. The approach of <ref> (King & Weiman 1990) </ref> uses cameras pointed towards the ceiling and thus cannot perceive most of the changes that occur in typical office environments. Unfortunately, such an approach is only applicable if the ceiling contains enough structure for accurate position estimation.
