Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Searching has been studied for over three decades. In Knuth <ref> [1] </ref>, one-dimensional searching involves unordered, ordered (using efficient data structures), and hashing. It is natural to ask the following question: Can we generalize the techniques to higher dimensions? It was later proved to be possible, yet much more difficult in time and space tradeoffs.

Reference-contexts: This case is by no means trivial, as we will see. Moreover, we uncover the mysteries of the design by citing the original works of Cartesian trees as the grandfather of some useful data structures: priority search trees (McCreight <ref> [4] </ref>), randomized binary search trees, and a special priority queue invented by French computer scientists Flajolet and Viennot [5].

To see this, we give the heritage diagram in Figure 1. 1 2 Cartesian Trees The Avant Garde It is Jean Vuillemin [6]who systematically treats the combinatorial interdependency between binary search trees and heap-ordered trees.

Reference-contexts: The number of n-node binary tournament trees having left subtree of size k (or right subtree of size k) is h k . where h k1 is Stirling number of first kind. 5 The above are purely Knutherian or combinatorial arguments, the inter-ested reader may find the proofs in Vuillemin <ref> [6] </ref>, By using the above arguments, we can analyze the behavior, as we might have guessed, of Cartesian tree to be H n -like. Because our main theme lies in the behavior of priority search trees, we give the following facts without proof. 1.
