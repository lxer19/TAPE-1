Abstract: Internet Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months. Internet Drafts may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is not appropriate to use Internet Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as a "working draft" or "work in progress."

Reference-contexts: Sections 3.8 and 3.9 summarize the timers and flags referred to throughout this document. The most significant functional changes since the January '95 version involve the Rendezvous Point-related mechanisms, several resulting simplifications to the protocol, and removal of the PIM-DM protocol details to a separate document <ref> [3] </ref> (for clarity). 2 PIM-SM Protocol Overview In this section we provide an overview of the architectural components of PIM-SM. A router 1 receives explicit Join/Prune messages from those neighboring routers that have downstream group members.

Reference-contexts: As specified in <ref> [4] </ref>, IGMP Host-Membership-Report messages are sent in response to a directly-connected router's IGMP Host-Membership-Query message (see figure 1) 2 . From this point on we refer to such a host as a receiver, R, (or member) of the group G.

Reference-contexts: Design choices center primarily around the distribution and usage of RP information for wide area, inter-domain groups. 2.12 Security All PIM control messages may use IPsec <ref> [5] </ref> to address security concerns. Security mechanisms are likely to be enhanced in the near future. draft-ietf-idmr-PIM-SM-spec-02.ps 10 3 Detailed Protocol Description This section describes the protocol operations from the perspective of an individual router implementation. <p> Thus, the Join/Prune applies to a (*,G) entry. WC Route entry Wildcard entry; if there is no more specific match for a particular source, packets will be forwarded according to this entry. 3.10 Security Editors Note: this section is to be completed. All PIM control messages may use IPsec <ref> [5] </ref> to address security concerns. draft-ietf-idmr-PIM-SM-spec-02.ps 26 4 Packet Formats This section describes the details of the packet formats for PIM control messages. All PIM control messages have protocol number 103. Basically, PIM messages are either unicast (e.g. Registers and Register-Stop), or multicast hop-by-hop to `ALL-PIM-ROUTERS' group `224.0.0.13' (e.g.
