Abstract: This work addresses the recovery of an image from noisy observations when multiple noisy copies of the image are available. The standard method is to compute the average of these copies. Since the wavelet thresholding technique has been shown to effectively denoise a single noisy copy, it is natural to consider combining these two operations of averaging and thresholding. The first important task is to find the optimal ordering. The second issue is the threshold selection for each method. By modeling the signal wavelet coefficients as Laplacian distributed and the noise as Gaussian, our investigation finds the optimal ordering to depend on the number of available copies and on the signal-to-noise ratio. We propose thresholds that are nearly optimal under the assumed model for each ordering. With the optimal and near-optimal thresholds, the two methods yield very similar performance, and both show considerable improvement over merely averaging.

Reference-contexts: Although the soft-thresholding operation tends to smooth the image slightly more than the hard-threshold function, it yields images with better visual quality especially when the noise power is significant.

Thus, soft-thresholding will be the preferred operation in this work. The next issue is the selection of the threshold value.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Since the seminal work of denoising via wavelet thresholding proposed by Donoho and Johnstone <ref> [3] </ref>, there have been many variations in both theory and practice. Most of these works are for applications in which there is only one set of observations (e.g. one time series sequence or one still image). <p> Thus for each detail subband, we wish to find the estimator of the coefficients which minimizes the expected squared error. 2.1. Wavelet Thresholding and Averaging To denoise one copy, the wavelet thresholding operation by Donoho and Johnstone <ref> [3] </ref> has three steps. First, take the wavelet transform of the noisy observation g = f + ", denoted by Y = X + V . Then each coefficient is thresholded with a chosen threshold. Finally, the thresholded coefficients are transformed back to yield the recovered signal. <p> For both methods, these two parameters are estimated the same way for a fair comparison. First the noise variance 2 n is estimated by the robust median estimator in the highest subband (also used in <ref> [3] </ref>), ^ n = Median (jY ij j)=:6745, with all Y ij in the HH 1 subband of the n-th copy, then ^ 2 is taken to be the average of these N estimates.

Reference-contexts: The recovery of the image is done in the orthogonal wavelet transform domain (the readers are referred to standard wavelet literature such as <ref> [4, 5] </ref> for details of the 2D dyadic wavelet transform). The wavelet coefficients can be grouped into subbands of different scale and orientation, with one lowest frequency subband, and the rest called detail subbands.

Reference-contexts: It has been found that for a large class of images, the coefficients in each detail subband can be well described by a Generalized Gaussian distribution <ref> [6] </ref>, which is often simplified to the special case of Laplacian distribution. In this work, we also use the Laplacian distribution. Under probability distributions, the MSE is well approximated by the expected squared error.
