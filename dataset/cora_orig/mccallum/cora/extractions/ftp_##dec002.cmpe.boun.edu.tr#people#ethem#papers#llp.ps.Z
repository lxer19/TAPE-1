Abstract: A structure composed of local linear perceptrons for approximating global class discriminants is investigated. Such local linear models may be combined in a cooperative or competitive way. In the cooperative model, a weighted sum of the outputs of the local perceptrons is computed where the weight is a function of the distance between the input and the position of the local perceptron. In the competitive model, the cost function dictates a mixture model where only one of the local perceptrons give output. Learning of the local models' positions and the linear mappings they implement are coupled and both supervised. We show that this is preferrable to the uncoupled case where the positions are trained in an unsupervised manner before the separate, supervised training of mappings. We use goodness criteria based on the cross-entropy and give learning equations for both the cooperative and competitive cases. The coupled and uncoupled versions of cooperative and competitive approaches are compared among themselves and with multi-layer perceptrons of sigmoidal hidden units and radial-basis functions of Gaussian units on the application of recognition of handwritten digits. The criteria of comparison are the generalization accuracy, learning time, and the number of free parameters. We conclude that even on such a high dimensional problem, such local models are promising. They generalize much better than radial-basis functions and use much less memory. When compared with multilayer perceptrons, we note that local models learn much faster and generalize as well and sometimes better with comparable number of parameters.
