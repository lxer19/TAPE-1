Title: Uniform Actions in Asynchronous Distributed Systems Extended Abstract  
Author: Dalia Malki Ken Birman Aleta Ricciardi Andre Schiper 
Abstract: We develop necessary conditions for the development of asynchronous distributed software that will perform uniform actions (events that if performed by any process, must be performed at all processes). The paper focuses on dynamic uniformity, which differs from the classical problems in that processes continually leave and join the ongoing computation. It relates the problem to asynchronous Consensus, and shows that Consensus is a harder problem. We provide a rigorous characterization of the framework upon which several existing distributed programming environments are based. And, our work shows that progress is sometimes possible in a primary-partition model even when consensus is not.

Reference-contexts: The first consists of actions that must be done both uniformly and in the same sequence. This sequence problem has been studied extensively in the context of distributed database systems <ref> [1, 10, 11, 17] </ref>. The second subclass applies to uniform actions that must also eventually be known to have terminated (i.e., taken by all processes that have not failed).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Our work on fault-tolerant distributed systems (Isis [4], Transis <ref> [2] </ref>, and Horus [18]) gives rise to a desire to understand the theoretical foundations upon which such systems depend.
