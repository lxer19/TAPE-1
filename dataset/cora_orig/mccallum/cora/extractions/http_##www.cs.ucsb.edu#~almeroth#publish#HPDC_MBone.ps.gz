Abstract: One purpose of the MBone is to study the performance of multicast and real-time protocols in global conferencing applications. Part of this evaluation is dependent on understanding how the MBone is used and developing realistic workloads and usage models to assist in protocol evaluation. We have developed a tool, called Mlisten, to accurately collect the join/leave times for multicast group members in MBone audio sessions. Using data collected with Mlisten and a set of analysis tools, we report statistics about several MBone audio sessions including member inter-arrival times and durations, multicast tree routing information, and group spatial characteristics. Data was also collected and analyzed for all active sessions to produce information about movement among multicast groups.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Multicast Backbone (MBone) is a virtual network overlaying the Internet <ref> [3] </ref>. It provides one-to-many, best effort delivery of real-time multimedia data between MBone-connected hosts. The MBone has served as a testbed for the development of multicast protocols, real-time protocols, and group conferencing tools.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 presents an analysis of behavior for single sessions. Section 5 analyzes behavior for all sessions. The paper is concluded in Section 6. 2 Conferencing on the MBone The MBone has been in a constant state of development since its inception in 1992 <ref> [4] </ref>. Connectivity was first provided using point-to-point IP-encapsulated tunnels between sites. Each tunnel connects two end-points via one logical link but may cross several Internet routers. Within a particular site, multicast capability has been provided using additional tunnels or the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP)[7, 8].

Reference-contexts: Multicast Tree Hop Count. In computing the cost of reaching a set of destinations, we consider several types of trees. Our cost metric is that of packet-hops (first used in <ref> [5] </ref>). For example, a tree from a source to multiple destinations will have a cost in packet-hops equal to the number of links in the tree. The types of trees we consider are: 1. <p> The routes used are roughly approximated using the MWatch tool [10]. The multicast hop count is compared to a unicast hop count which is computed assuming that the source transmits to each receiver individually (also known as the separately-addressed packets scheme <ref> [5] </ref>). 2. MBone Tree with Georgia Tech Source: In order to assess the sensitivity of tree costs to source location we repeat the above analysis but assume a host at Georgia Tech is the source.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the ability to collect data and build workload traces and models is a useful result of this research. The MBone behavior we are most interested in is based on the scheduling of world-wide MBone events which are typically announced ahead of time in a global session directory <ref> [13, 11] </ref>. Using information in this session directory, interested people can join multicast groups and receive real-time audio and/or video streams. Our primary interest lies in monitoring the rate at which people join each session and the duration of membership. <p> Information about these sessions are periodically transmitted over the MBone on a well-known multicast address. Using either SD [13] or SDR <ref> [11] </ref>, MBone users can obtain a list of active sessions. An MBone user can choose from this list and launch the MBone tools (including audio, video, or whiteboard) required to receive the component streams of a session.
