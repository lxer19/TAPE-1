Abstract: There has been increased research interest in systems composed of multiple autonomous mobile robots exhibiting cooperative behavior. Groups of mobile robots are constructed, with an aim to studying such issues as group architecture, resource conflict, origin of cooperation, learning, and geometric problems. As yet, few applications of cooperative robotics have been reported, and supporting theory is still in its formative stages. In this paper, we give a critical survey of existing works and discuss open problems in this field, emphasizing the various theoretical issues that arise in the study of cooperative robotics. We describe the intellectual heritages that have guided early research, as well as possible additions to the set of existing motivations.

Resource Conflict When a single indivisible resource is requested by multiple robots, resource conflict arises. This issue has been studied in many guises, notably the mutual exclusion problem in distributed algorithms and the multiaccess problem in computer networks.

Reference-contexts: We are not aware of any instances of systems that are completely centralized, although there are some hybrid centralized/decentralized architectures wherein there is a central planner that exerts high-level control over mostly autonomous agents [126], [106], <ref> [3] </ref>, [36]. Differentiation We define a group of robots to be homogeneous if the capabilities of the individual robots are identical, and heterogeneous otherwise.

Reference-contexts: However, we note path planning separately because of its intrinsic geometric flavor as well as its historical importance in the literature. Detailed reviews of path planning are found in [55], [99], <ref> [6] </ref>. Fujimura [55] views path planning as either centralized (with a universal path-planner making decisions) or distributed (with individual agents planning and adjusting their paths).

On the other hand, [183] presents a distributed approach (per Fujimura's taxonomy) where each robot initially attempts a straight-line path to the goal; if an interfering obstacle is seen, then the robot will scan the visible vertices of the obstacle and move toward the closest one.

Reference-contexts: There are also communication mechanisms designed specially for multiple-robot systems. For example, [171] proposes the "sign-board" as a communication mechanism for distributed robotic systems. <ref> [7] </ref> gives a communication protocol modeled after diffusion, wherein local communication similar to chemical communication mechanisms in animals is used. The communication is engineered to decay away at a preset rate. Similar communications mechanisms are studied in [102], [49], [67].

Reference-contexts: In foraging, a group of robots must pick up objects scattered in the environment; this is evocative of toxic waste cleanup, harvesting, search and rescue, etc. The foraging task is one of the canonical testbeds for cooperative 4 Cao, et al. robotics [32] [151] [10] [67] [102] [49] [108] <ref> [9] </ref> [24]. <p> However, we note that recently, researchers have begun to empirically study quantitative measures of cooperation, trying to identify conditions under which mechanisms for cooperation are beneficial [11], <ref> [9] </ref>, [135]. Finally, several basic analogies remain incomplete, and must be revisited and resynthesized as the field matures. For instance, many multi-robot problems are "canonical" for distributed computation and are interesting primarily when viewed in this light.

Reference-contexts: We are aware of two previous works that have surveyed or taxonomized the literature. <ref> [13] </ref> is a broad, relatively succinct survey whose scope encompasses distributed autonomous robotic systems (i.e., not restricted to mobile robots). [50] focuses on several well-known "swarm" architectures (e.g., SWARM and Mataric's Behavior-based architecture see Section 2.1) and proposes a taxonomy to characterize these architectures.

Reference-contexts: In the ACTRESS system, "robotors", including 3 robots and 3 workstations (one as interface to human operator, one as image processor and one as global environment manager), form a heterogeneous group trying to perform tasks such as object pushing <ref> [14] </ref> that cannot be accomplished by any of the individual robotors alone [79], [156]. Communication protocols at different abstraction levels [115] provide a means upon which "group cast" and negotiation mechanisms based on Contract Net [150] and multistage negotiation protocols are built [18]. <p> However, researchers considering real-world multi-robot systems typically conclude that planning paths in advance is impossible. Thus, robots are often restricted to prescribed paths or roads, with rules (much like traffic laws in the human world) and communications used to avoid collision and deadlock [35], <ref> [14] </ref>. Grossman [68] classifies instances of the traffic control problem into three types: (i) restricted roads, (ii) multiple possible roads with robots selecting autonomously between them, and (iii) multiple possible roads with centralized traffic control.

These early projects were done primarily in simulation, and, while the early work on CEBOT, ACTRESS and GOFER have all had physical implementations (with 3 robots), in some sense these implementations were presented by way of proving the simulation results. <p> Recently, a Micro Autonomous Robotic System (MARS) has been built consisting of robots of 20 cubic mm and equipped with infrared communications [121]. 8 Cao, et al.

Reference-contexts: Webster's dictionary [118] defines "cooperate" as "to associate with another or others for mutual, often economic, benefit". Explicit definitions of cooperation in the robotics literature, while surprisingly sparse, include: 1. "joint collaborative behavior that is directed toward some goal in which there is a common interest or reward" <ref> [22] </ref>; 2. "a form of interaction, usually based on com munication" [108]; and 3. "[joining] together for doing something that creates a progressive result such as increasing performance or saving time" [137]. These definitions show the wide range of possible motivating perspectives.

Reference-contexts: The foraging task is one of the canonical testbeds for cooperative 4 Cao, et al. robotics [32] [151] [10] [67] [102] [49] [108] [9] <ref> [24] </ref>. The task is interesting because (1) it can be performed by each robot independently (i.e., the issue is whether multiple robots achieve a performance gain), and (2) as discussed in Section 3.2, the task is also interesting due to motivations related to the biological inspirations behind cooperative robot systems. <p> There are some conceptual overlaps with the related task of materials handling in a manufacturing work-cell [47]. A wide variety of techniques have been applied, ranging from simple stigmergy (essentially random movements that result in the fortuitous collection of objects <ref> [24] </ref> to more complex algorithms in which robots form chains along which objects are passed to the goal [49]. [24] defines stigmergy as "the production of a certain behaviour in agents as a consequence of the effects produced in the local environment by previous behaviour". <p> A wide variety of techniques have been applied, ranging from simple stigmergy (essentially random movements that result in the fortuitous collection of objects <ref> [24] </ref> to more complex algorithms in which robots form chains along which objects are passed to the goal [49].

In studies of locomotion in large herds of (upto 100) one-legged robots and simulated human cyclists, [77] [29] take an alternate approach of design a very physically realistic simulation. <p> Works based on this insect-colony analogy include [108], <ref> [24] </ref>, [153], [47], [82], [41], [42]. The pattern generation of CRS's can also be considered as bottom-up (see Section 2.5), since each robot is designed as a very simple agent which follows a set of prespecified rules.

Reference-contexts: In the late 1980's, the robotics research community became very active in cooperative robotics, beginning with projects such as CEBOT [59], SWARM <ref> [25] </ref>, ACTRESS [16], GOFER [35], and the work at Brussels [151]. <p> Various issues are studied, such as efficient communications between robots and environment managers [17], collision avoidance [19]. SWARM A SWARM is a distributed system with a large number of autonomous robots [81]. (Note that the work on SWARM systems began as work on Cellular Robotic Systems <ref> [25] </ref>, where many simple agents occupied one- or two-dimensional environments and were able to perform tasks such as pattern generation and self-organization). SWARM intelligence is "a property of systems of non-intelligent robots exhibiting collectively intelligent behavior" [69]. <p> Related to the Formation problem is the pattern generation problem in Cellular Robotic Systems, multiple-robot systems which can "encode information as patterns of its own structural units" <ref> [25] </ref>. Typically, one- or two-dimensional grids constitute the workspace, and sensing of neighboring cells is the only input. Within these constraints, a set of rules is devised and applied to all agents; a standard result is to show in simulation that convergence to some spatial pattern is guaranteed. <p> Distributed Systems A multiple-robot system is in fact a special case of a distributed system. Thus, the field of distributed systems is a natural source of ideas and solutions. <ref> [25] </ref> describes cellular robotics as belonging to the general field of distributed computing. <p> Representative work that is based on this concept includes [170], [151], [69], [70], [26]. Self-organization in multi-cellular biological systems has been an inspiration for [71], <ref> [25] </ref>, [51], [63]. Hierarchical organization of biological multi-cellular organisms (i.e., from cellular to tissue to organism level) has been used as a guiding metaphor for cellular robotics in the CEBOT project [59]. Biological analogies have also influenced the choice of task domains studied in cooperative robotics.

Reference-contexts: SWARM exhibits a distributed architecture, usually with no differentiation among members (an exception is [70], where two different types of robots were used). Interaction takes place by each cell reacting to the state of its nearest neighbors. Mechanisms for self-organization in SWARM are studied in [70] [27] <ref> [26] </ref> [69] [103] [81]. Examples for possible applications include large-scale displays and distributed sensing [71]. Communication primitives have been an important part of research in SWARM [170], [173] (see Section 3.2 below for more details). <p> Egecioglu and Zim-mermann [51] pose the "Random Pairing" problem, and seek a set of rules by which for any given number, a CRS will converge to a pattern such that there is a group of two robots with that number of vacant spaces between them (see also <ref> [26] </ref>). An analogous cellular approach is adopted by Genovese et al. [63], who describe the simulation of a system of pollutant-seeking mobile robots. The simulation uses a potential field mechanism to attract robots to the pollutant and to repulse robots from each other. <p> However, in the field of cooperative robotics, references to self-organization have often been made in a biological context.) The behavior of insect colonies described above can be characterized more generally as that of self-organizing systems.

Self-organization in multi-cellular biological systems has been an inspiration for [71], [25], [51], [63].

Reference-contexts: SWARM exhibits a distributed architecture, usually with no differentiation among members (an exception is [70], where two different types of robots were used). Interaction takes place by each cell reacting to the state of its nearest neighbors. Mechanisms for self-organization in SWARM are studied in [70] <ref> [27] </ref> [26] [69] [103] [81]. Examples for possible applications include large-scale displays and distributed sensing [71]. Communication primitives have been an important part of research in SWARM [170], [173] (see Section 3.2 below for more details).

Reference-contexts: Coordination and interactions of multiple intelligent agents have been actively studied in the field of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) since the early 1970's <ref> [28] </ref>, but the DAI field concerned itself mainly with problems involving software agents. In the late 1980's, the robotics research community became very active in cooperative robotics, beginning with projects such as CEBOT [59], SWARM [25], ACTRESS [16], GOFER [35], and the work at Brussels [151]. <p> Unlike eusocial behavior, cooperative behavior is not motivated by innate behavior, but by an intentional desire to cooperate in order to maximize individual utility. Inspired by economics and game-theoretic approaches, <ref> [28] </ref> [62] [142] [143] and others have studied the emergence of cooperation in selfish rational agents in the field of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI). A recent work in the robotics literature that adopts this game-theoretic approach is [128]. 2.4. <p> Distributed Artificial Intelligence The field of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) concerns itself with the study of distributed systems of intelligent agents. As such, this field is highly relevant to cooperative robotics. Bond and Gasser <ref> [28] </ref> define DAI as "the subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with concurrency in AI computations, at many levels." Grounded in traditional symbolic AI and the social sciences, DAI is composed of two major areas of study: Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) and Multiagent Systems (MAS).

Reference-contexts: Simplified instances of the Marching problem require robots to reliably follow each other and to move in a group (without tight constraints on their relative positions). Some works that address this problem (sometimes referred to as the herding/flocking problem) include [140], [108], [77], <ref> [29] </ref>, [119]. A somewhat related problem is the problem of cooperative positioning (determining the locations of the robots in a group using limited information) [98]. <p> In studies of locomotion in large herds of (upto 100) one-legged robots and simulated human cyclists, [77] <ref> [29] </ref> take an alternate approach of design a very physically realistic simulation.

Reference-contexts: Thus, several more recent works (cf. [91], [111], [131]) are significant for establishing an emphasis on the actual physical implementation of cooperative robotic systems. Many of the recent cooperative robotic systems, in contrast to the earlier works, are based on a behavior-based approach (cf. <ref> [30] </ref>). Various perspectives on autonomy and on the connection between intelligence and environment are strongly associated with the behavior-based approach [31], but are not intrinsic to multiple-robot systems and thus lie beyond our present scope. <p> For example, traffic rules are commonly used to reduce planning cost for avoiding collision and deadlock in a real-world environment, such as a network of roads. (Interestingly, behavior-based approaches identify collision avoidance as one of the most basic behaviors <ref> [30] </ref>, and achieving a collision-avoidance behavior is the natural solution to collision avoidance among multiple robots. However, in reported experiments that use the behavior-based approach, robots are never restricted to road networks.) * Box-Pushing/Cooperative Manipulation. Many works have addressed the box-pushing (or couch-pushing) problem, for widely varying reasons.

GOFER The GOFER architecture <ref> [35] </ref>, [100] was used to study distributed problem solving by multiple mobile robots in an indoor environment using traditional AI techniques. <p> However, researchers considering real-world multi-robot systems typically conclude that planning paths in advance is impossible. Thus, robots are often restricted to prescribed paths or roads, with rules (much like traffic laws in the human world) and communications used to avoid collision and deadlock <ref> [35] </ref>, [14]. Grossman [68] classifies instances of the traffic control problem into three types: (i) restricted roads, (ii) multiple possible roads with robots selecting autonomously between them, and (iii) multiple possible roads with centralized traffic control. <p> Perhaps the Cooperative Mobile Robotics: Antecedents and Directions 15 best known scheme for task allocation is the Contract Net Protocol [150], which has been used in the ACTRESS [79], [18], [130] and GOFER <ref> [35] </ref> projects.

Reference-contexts: However, in reported experiments that use the behavior-based approach, robots are never restricted to road networks.) * Box-Pushing/Cooperative Manipulation. Many works have addressed the box-pushing (or couch-pushing) problem, for widely varying reasons. The focus in [134] is on task allocation, fault-tolerance and (reinforcement) learning. By contrast, <ref> [45] </ref> studies two box-pushing protocols in terms of their intrinsic communication and hardware requirements, via the concept of information invariants. Cooperative manipulation of large objects is particularly interesting in that cooperation can be achieved without the robots even knowing of each others' existence [147], [159]. <p> in cooperative robotics has addressed facets of this problem, and the major research axes of the field follow from elements of this problem. (Note that certain basic robot interactions are not task-performing interactions per se, but are rather basic primitives upon which task-performing interactions can be built, e.g., following ([39], <ref> [45] </ref> and many others) or flocking [140], [108]. It might be argued that these interactions entail "control and coordination" tasks rather than "cooperation" tasks, but our treatment does not make such a distinction). First, the realization of cooperative behavior must rely on some infrastructure, the group architecture. <p> In cooperative robotics, agent modeling has been explored most extensively in the context of manipulating a large object. Many solutions have exploited the fact that the object can serve as a common medium by which the agents can model each other. The second of two box-pushing protocols in <ref> [45] </ref> can achieve "cooperation without communication" since the object being manipulated also functions as a "communication channel" that is shared by the robot agents; other works capitalize on the same concept to derive distributed control laws which rely only on local measures of force, torque, orientation, or distance, i.e., no explicit <p> The works of <ref> [45] </ref>, [145], [33] have begun to address this issue, in the context of object manipulation tasks; interestingly, [33] observes that given a robot system, some tasks are strongly cooperative the robots must act in concert to achieve the goal, and the strategy for the task is not trivially se rializable. 3.

Reference-contexts: However, researchers considering real-world multi-robot systems typically conclude that planning paths in advance is impossible. Thus, robots are often restricted to prescribed paths or roads, with rules (much like traffic laws in the human world) and communications used to avoid collision and deadlock [35], [14]. Grossman <ref> [68] </ref> classifies instances of the traffic control problem into three types: (i) restricted roads, (ii) multiple possible roads with robots selecting autonomously between them, and (iii) multiple possible roads with centralized traffic control. <p> When individual robots possess unique roads from one point to another, no conflict is possible; when there is global knowledge and centralized control, it is easy to prevent conflict. Thus, the interesting case is (ii), where robots are allowed to autonomously select roads. Analysis in <ref> [68] </ref> shows that restricted roads are highly suboptimal, and that the autonomous road choice coupled with a greedy policy for escaping blocked situations is far more effective (cf. "modest cooperation" [137], where robots are assumed to be benevolent for the common good of the system).

Reference-contexts: Cooperative manipulation of large objects is particularly interesting in that cooperation can be achieved without the robots even knowing of each others' existence [147], [159].

In foraging, a group of robots must pick up objects scattered in the environment; this is evocative of toxic waste cleanup, harvesting, search and rescue, etc. <p> Works based on this insect-colony analogy include [108], [24], [153], [47], <ref> [82] </ref>, [41], [42]. The pattern generation of CRS's can also be considered as bottom-up (see Section 2.5), since each robot is designed as a very simple agent which follows a set of prespecified rules.

Reference-contexts: A rich body of research on algorithms, 16 Cao, et al. protocols, performance modeling and analysis in computer networks can be applied to cooperative robotics. There is currently a great amount of effort being put into studying networking issues related to mobile/nomadic/ubiquitous computing (cf. [20], [176], <ref> [88] </ref>, [21]). Results from this field could be applied in a straightforward way to multi-robot systems. Finally, distributed control is a promising framework for the coordination of multiple robots.

Reference-contexts: In addition, techniques inspired by biological evolution have also been used in cooperative robotics. [177] uses a genetic algorithm [66] to evolve neural network controllers for simulated "prey" creatures that learn a herding behavior to help avoid predators. [138] uses genetic programming <ref> [90] </ref> to evolve flocking behavior in simulated "boids." Cooperative Mobile Robotics: Antecedents and Directions 11 2.5. Geometric Problems Because mobile robots can move about in the physical world and must interact with each other physically, geometric problems are inherent to multiple-robot systems. <p> Interestingly, we note that the algorithm of [155] can be slightly modified: rather than each robot seeking to achieve a prescribed ratio D=d, each robot could seek to achieve a prescribed angle <ref> (close to 90 degrees) </ref> subtended by its farthest neighbor and its closest neighbor to the right. This uses very similar sensing capabilities but guarantees the desired circular shape. For Marching, [37] employs positional constraint conditions in a group of robots that makes turns while maintaining an array pattern.

Reference-contexts: These early projects were done primarily in simulation, and, while the early work on CEBOT, ACTRESS and GOFER have all had physical implementations (with 3 robots), in some sense these implementations were presented by way of proving the simulation results. Thus, several more recent works (cf. <ref> [91] </ref>, [111], [131]) are significant for establishing an emphasis on the actual physical implementation of cooperative robotic systems. Many of the recent cooperative robotic systems, in contrast to the earlier works, are based on a behavior-based approach (cf. [30]). <p> Cooperative manipulation of large objects is particularly interesting in that cooperation can be achieved without the robots even knowing of each others' existence [147], [159]. Other works in the class of box-pushing/object manipulation include [175] [153] [82] [33] <ref> [91] </ref> [94] [92] [114] [145] [72] [146]. * Foraging. In foraging, a group of robots must pick up objects scattered in the environment; this is evocative of toxic waste cleanup, harvesting, search and rescue, etc. <p> The architecture has been implemented both on groups of up to 20 real robots (the largest group reported in the works we surveyed) and in simulation. Similar behavior-based architectures include the work by Kube et al, which is based on an Adaptive Logic Network, a neural network <ref> [91] </ref>, [92], [94], [93], the Tropism-Based Cognitive Architecture [2], and an architecture based on "instinctive behaviors" [40]. 2.2.

Reference-contexts: Interaction via sensing is indispensable for modeling of other agents (see Section 2.1.4 below). Because of hardware limitations, interaction via sensing has often been emulated using radio or infrared communications. However, several recent works attempt to implement true interaction via sensing, based on vision <ref> [95] </ref>, [96], [154]. Collective behaviors that can use this kind of interaction include flocking and pattern formation (keeping in formation with nearest neighbors). <p> For the basic problem of differentiating between other agents and all other objects in the environment. some researchers [134] use radio communication to solve this problem. In other works [43], [134] interaction via sensing is done by explicit radio communication. There are recent attempts to perform recognition via vision <ref> [95] </ref>, [96]. An approach taken by some researchers is to use simulations as prototypes for larger-scale studies, and small numbers of real robots as a proof-of-concept demonstration [108], [134].

Reference-contexts: Note that there is also a related, geometric problem of optimizing the allocation of tasks spatially. This has been recently studied in the context of the division of the search of a work area by multiple robots <ref> [97] </ref>. Whereas the first four axes are related to the generation of cooperative behavior, our fifth and final axis geometric problems - covers research issues that are tied to the embedding of robot tasks in a two- or three-dimensional world.

Reference-contexts: Some works that address this problem (sometimes referred to as the herding/flocking problem) include [140], [108], [77], [29], [119]. A somewhat related problem is the problem of cooperative positioning (determining the locations of the robots in a group using limited information) <ref> [98] </ref>. Related to the Formation problem is the pattern generation problem in Cellular Robotic Systems, multiple-robot systems which can "encode information as patterns of its own structural units" [25]. Typically, one- or two-dimensional grids constitute the workspace, and sensing of neighboring cells is the only input.
