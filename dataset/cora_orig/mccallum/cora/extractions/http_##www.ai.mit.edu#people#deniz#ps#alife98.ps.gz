Abstract: Artificial life has long held out the promise of revolutionizing how scientists approach a variety of problems. In this paper we describe an application of artificial life techniques to the study of a fundamental problem in economics: How does a firm transition from monopoly behavior to competitive behavior as other firms enter the market? Solving traditional economic models provides the equilibrium, but does not give the path to equilibrium.The firms in our artificial life simulation do not have access to any global information about the market. The resulting global behavior that arises from this local price-setting behavior is the equilibrium predicted by the traditional analytical models. Hence, our simulation provides a proof by example that simple, local rules of interaction can create the global regularities observed and predicted by economists, thus providing a relatively low upper bound on how complex firm agents must be to reach equilibrium. In this paper we describe the various agents in the model-firms, consumers, capital suppliers, labor suppliers-and present the outcome of several simulations of the model.

Reference-contexts: One of the most complete artificial life models of an economy is the Aspen system developed by Richard Pryor and colleagues at Sandia National Labs <ref> (Basu et al. 1996) </ref>. Aspen has a rich set of agents, including households, firms in four different sectors, a realtor, a capital goods producer, banks, and a government. The firms use a genetic algorithm to select a price that maximizes profits.

Reference-contexts: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in a lot of transition economies has followed a U-shaped pattern, an initial decline followed by growth. However, the severity of the fall and its duration has differed <ref> (Blanchard 1996) </ref>. The private sector's share of the GDP has increased, but the increase has been anywhere from double to tenfold (Selowsky & Martin 1997). Countries that have adopted similar reform packages have differed drastically in their responses (Frye & Schleifer 1997).

Examining phenomena such as the U-shaped pattern in output requires modeling the dynamics of the economy. We adopt an artificial life methodology that lends itself with greater ease to modeling these dynamics.

Reference-contexts: Since the demise of the Soviet Union, this has become a relevant and hot research topic. Many countries have begun to move away from a centrally planned economy to a more market-based economy. The transition from communism can be analyzed in terms of four basic tasks of economic reform <ref> (Sachs 1996) </ref> : * Systemic Transformation: The institutional, legal, political, and administrative change of the economic system from state-ownership and central planning to private ownership and market allocation of resources. * Financial Stabilization: The end of the pre-reform monetary overhang, high inflation, and large fiscal deficits. * Structural Adjustment: The initial <p> The transition economies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have demonstrated that it is possible to introduce the institutions of a market economy within five years. According to Jeffrey Sachs <ref> (Sachs 1996) </ref>: . . . liberalization of the economy surely proved to be the quickest and most effective area of change. In the fastest-reform economies, currency convertibility was quickly established; prices were freed, and shortages eliminated; and international barriers were cut, resulting in significant growth of trade. . . .

Reference-contexts: These results show that asset prices can deviate sharply from their fundamental values. In Tesfatsion's Trade Network Game (TNG), the player set is a collection of traders consisting of pure buyers, pure sellers, and buyer-sellers <ref> (Tesfatsion 1997) </ref>. Buyers repeatedly submit trade offers to sellers, who either refuse or accept these offers. If a seller accepts a trade offer from a buyer, the seller and buyer engage in a risky trade modeled as a standard pris-oner's dilemma game.

Reference-contexts: Work by Youssefmir, Huberman, and Hogg provides a possible explanation for why markets crash, a particularly timely topic given the market gyrations of 1997 <ref> (Youssefmir, Huberman, & Hogg 1996) </ref>. In their model, a set of heterogeneous agents trade in an asset market based on the agents' expectations of what future prices will be. These expectations are based on two components: the fundamental price and a trend.
