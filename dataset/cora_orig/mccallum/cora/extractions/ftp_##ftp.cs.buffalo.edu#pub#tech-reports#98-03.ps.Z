Reference-contexts: The interior of a certain region has uniform features and no edges while its boundary is an edge and not uniform. Pixels not belonging to any certain region are 13 classified as uncertain. Using Edge Information to Improve Region-Based Segmentation The studies reported in <ref> [1, 24, 74, 97] </ref> use the strategy of using edge information to improve region-based segmentation or to control a region growing process. In effect, the segmentation result of one method is modified or improved using the result of another method. <p> In effect, the segmentation result of one method is modified or improved using the result of another method. Therefore, these can be classified as approaches that uses multiple techniques, rather than as approaches that integrates multiple segmentation results. Anderson et al. <ref> [1] </ref> use the number of regions that is assumed to be known to estimate parameters of an edge detection algorithm. <p> When this is the case, we should use other regression functions which can better fit the given data. The following real-world example illustrates this point. Example Table 3.1 shows an example of real data, where the object locator m i outputs measurement values in the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Since the measurement values are continuous, we need to group them in some way such that the estimates of 's are meaningful. We divide the range of measurements into ten equal-sized bins. <p> Let us denote the set of all subsets of X, the power set of X, as 2 X . A fuzzy measure 145 g : 2 X ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is a set function with the following properties: g () = 0; (A.14) A B ) g (A) g (B): (A.16) A fuzzy measure is not a probability measure such that there is no particular require ment that P n i=1 g (fx i g) = 1.

Reference-contexts: The system uses less image processing operations than ABLS and replaces the complex rule-based inference engine of ABLS with a more deterministic evidence combination method. In particular, the system uses multiple `pools of processors' to achieve real-time performance. Antognini and Turnbaugh <ref> [2] </ref> use an expert system shell to implement a rule-based address block location system. Using color analysis, the system first looks for colored address labels. If it finds one, the processing skips to the very end.

Reference-contexts: They show that the technique is able to nonlinearly combine objective evidence with subjective evaluation of the worth of the sources toward the final decision.

Reference-contexts: Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory Shlien [86] proposes the use of multiple binary decision tree classifiers where each tree is designed using a different feature selection criterion. A single feature vector is thus processed by several decision trees. Classification results are combined by the Dempster-Shafer model <ref> [5, 84] </ref> which combines associated confidence measures. Experimental results on recognizing machine-printed characters show performance 20 improvements. Rogova [81] presents a method for combining neural network classifiers based on the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence.

Reference-contexts: Otherwise, segmentation rules for handwriting are applied. When the image has been deemed cluttered and confidence values of top candidate blocks are low, the cluttered assumption is retracted and the image is reprocessed using handwriting segmentation rules. Bartneck <ref> [6] </ref> presents hybrid knowledge representation schemes for expressing knowledge used in various modules for address block location. Frame-based knowledge representation is used for image acquisition, iconic image processing, block segmentation, and block evaluation modules. A rule-based scheme is used for decision expert, conflict expert, and control expert modules.

Reference-contexts: Destination address is found by selecting the block with the highest confidence measure of belonging to the destination address class. This approach has not been pursued much, mainly because many researchers considered it too straightforward to adapt to widely varying visual properties of destination addresses. Bergman et al. <ref> [7] </ref> propose an approach of this type. The approach detects horizontal and vertical edges separately and form candidate blocks by finding edge pixels showing a signature of text and merging them properly.

Reference-contexts: They use a multiple network architecture for online handwriting recognition. The recognition results using the fuzzy integral are compared with results of other consensus methods such as the majority vote and the Borda count <ref> [8] </ref>. Gader and Mohamed [25, 26] use the fuzzy integral to combine three handwritten word classifiers based on segmentation, hidden Markov models [79], and fuzzy hidden Markov models, respectively. They compare combination results using the methods of the Borda count, weighted Borda count, Sugeno integral [88], and Choquet integral [63].

Falavigna, </author> <title> "Person identification using multiple cues," </title> <journal> IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, </journal> <volume> 17(10), </volume> <pages> 955-966, </pages> <month> October </month> <year> 1995. </year> <month> 158 </month>
Reference-contexts: They perform combination using the maximum and averaging operators and compare their performance with that of the best classifier and the theoretically best performance. Either of the two combination methods achieved improvements over the best classifier among each pair of classifiers. Brunelli and Falavigna <ref> [9] </ref> present a person identification system that integrates speaker recognition and face recognition modules. Two classifiers using acoustic features and three using visual ones are combined using two different approaches. In 25 the first approach, classification scores are normalized and combined using a weighted geometric average. <p> Remarks There are three possible types of classifier outputs. A classifier can output a unique class decision, ranked candidate classes, or candidate classes with associated measurement values. Most combination approaches combine decisions of a single type. Combination methods capable of combining classifier decisions of different types are given in <ref> [9, 51] </ref>. We also observe that most approaches organize classifiers in a parallel fashion rather than a serial fashion. Serial combination of classifiers is investigated in [17, 47, 60]. <p> For these reasons, measurement values from different locators need to be normalized before we attempt to combine them. There are methods for doing it so that measurement values all have a standard range such as from 0 to 1 <ref> [9, 34] </ref>. However, those methods cannot be used for abstract or rank-level output, where no measurement values are available to begin with. Therefore, we do not normalize measurement values, but evaluate them regarding the probabilistic confidence they indicate, based on the previous locator behavior.

Reference-contexts: Combination results show considerable improvements in classification correctness. Ghosh et al. [27] present and compare four methods of evidence combination for classification of underwater acoustic signals. The four methods are entropy-based weighting of individual classifier outputs, combination of confidence factors in a manner similar to that used in MYCIN <ref> [10] </ref>, majority voting, and averaging. All the methods are reported to have shown better results than those obtained by the best individual classifier. Ho et al. [30, 31, 32, 33] discuss a multiple classifier system, where classifier decisions are represented as rankings of classes. <p> The system uses three types of reasoning models. Probabilistic theory is used to deal with statistical data, fuzzy set theory to handle memberships (such as in the context level), and evidence combination is performed using confidence factors as in MYCIN <ref> [10] </ref>. Jelinek et al. [43] propose an address block location architecture with three channels of processing corresponding to red, green, and blue color images, where identical processing is done in each channel.

Reference-contexts: The combined classifier shows a significant improvement in the error rate. Cao et al. <ref> [12] </ref> use the fuzzy integral to combine results of multiple character classifiers. They propose a method to assign classifier relevance using classifier performance matrices. <p> It was first developed by Sugeno [88] and has been used in several information fusion problems <ref> [3, 4, 12, 90] </ref>. Fuzzy integrals are described in detail in Section A.2. To use fuzzy integrals in our theory, we first need to determine what the fuzzy densities will be.

Reference-contexts: Cao et al. [12] use the fuzzy integral to combine results of multiple character classifiers. They propose a method to assign classifier relevance using classifier performance matrices. Four neural network classifiers are combined and experiments are performed on handwritten numerals. 22 Cho and Kim <ref> [13] </ref> use the fuzzy integral to combine results of three neural network classifiers. They use a multiple network architecture for online handwriting recognition. The recognition results using the fuzzy integral are compared with results of other consensus methods such as the majority vote and the Borda count [8].

Reference-contexts: Depending on the variance property, the method selects the result from one of the methods, pixel by pixel. This method integrates two thresholding results rather than segmentation results, by pixel-level selection. Segmentation Map Integration Chu and Aggarwal <ref> [14] </ref> investigate parallel integration of multiple segmentation results. They describe an algorithm that integrates multiple region segmentation maps and edge maps. The integration algorithm attempts to generate a consensus of the true underlying segmentation from multiple observations.

Reference-contexts: Frame-based knowledge representation is used for image acquisition, iconic image processing, block segmentation, and block evaluation modules. A rule-based scheme is used for decision expert, conflict expert, and control expert modules. The termination module uses procedural knowledge. De Gaetano <ref> [15] </ref> uses a rule-based expert system only in the block ranking stage. Color and gray-level processing to extract candidate blocks produce Prolog facts about 29 the incoming mail piece. Knowledge of mail characteristics is represented as Prolog predicates that are partitioned into five levels.

Reference-contexts: Each cluster is assigned scores for belonging to categories of destination address, return address, 31 and stamp, based on its position. The cluster with the highest score for destination address is selected as the destination address. Downton and Leedham <ref> [16] </ref> propose a simple approach based on geometric features. Horizontal smearing is done on the binary image, and its resolution is reduced to remove small regions of high black pixel density.

Reference-contexts: They argue that preconditioned selection has lower error bounds than postconditioned selection. A neural network solution to preconditioned selection is given. Handprinted digit recognition is used as the example problem illustrating the benefits of the solution. Serial Combination Duerr et al. <ref> [17] </ref> present a hierarchical multi-stage organization of a handwritten numeral recognition system. The system consists of a statistical classifier, a structural classifier, a stage for reducing the number of hypotheses, and a combined stage for making the final classification. <p> Most combination approaches combine decisions of a single type. Combination methods capable of combining classifier decisions of different types are given in [9, 51]. We also observe that most approaches organize classifiers in a parallel fashion rather than a serial fashion. Serial combination of classifiers is investigated in <ref> [17, 47, 60] </ref>. Computational models for dynamically selecting the best classifier for an input pattern are proposed in [52, 98]. 2.1.4 Integrating Visual Modules Integration of vision modules is recognized as a promising approach towards robust solutions to many vision tasks, especially in low-level vision and 3-D reconstruction.

Reference-contexts: The approach detects horizontal and vertical edges separately and form candidate blocks by finding edge pixels showing a signature of text and merging them properly. It then extracts eight features for each candidate block and use the Mahalanobis distance metric <ref> [18] </ref> to classify the block as one of destination address, return address, stamp, clutter, large clutter, and small address fragment. For each candidate block, its distance to the destination address class and the weight of the class assigned to it are combined to compute the confidence measure for it.

Reference-contexts: Because mail piece images from different streams have very different characteristics, a complex set of rules was required to process mail piece images that might come from any stream appropriately. Srihari et al. [87] describe an address block location system (ABLS) based on the blackboard model <ref> [19, 66] </ref> of problem solving. ABLS is composed of six parts: 28 mail statistics database, rule-based inference engine, control data, control mecha-nism, blackboard, and toolbox. It is a framework for coordinating a collection of specialized image and symbolic processing tools needed for mail piece image analysis.

Reference-contexts: Based on each feature, the degrees of membership of each pixel in the labels are computed. A two-layer neural network combines the membership values using the fl-model [101] as the aggregation operator, which allows varying degrees of compensation between the union and intersection. Local Decision Integration Etemad et al. <ref> [20, 21] </ref> present a document page segmentation algorithm which classifies regions into text, image, and graphics. The algorithm uses feature vectors based on a multi-scale wavelet packet representation for local classification. Segmentation is done by propagating soft local decisions made on small windows across neighboring blocks and integrating them.

Reference-contexts: Three approaches based on majority voting, Bayesian formalism, Dempster-Shafer formalism, respectively, are suggested for combining abstract-level classifiers. Various experiments on handwritten numerals show that combining multiple classifiers is a promising direction. Franke and Mandler <ref> [22] </ref> compare two approaches to combining the votes of cooperating classifiers. One is based on the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence and the other is a statistical approach with some assumptions on input data. Both approaches 23 are tested in user-dependent recognition of on-line handwritten characters.

Fua and Hanson <ref> [24] </ref> apply high-level domain knowledge and an edge-based technique to select the best segmentation from a series of images segmented based on regions. They apply the method to extracting instances of generic shapes such as buildings, roads, and vegetation clumps.

Reference-contexts: We refer to this problem as the object correspondence problem. It 43 differs from the visual correspondence problem, which consists of matching all pairs of corresponding points from two images of the same scene, according to the definition in <ref> [29] </ref>. Hereafter, correspondence means object correspondence. <p> Connected Component Detection Connected components of a mail piece image usually correspond to character strokes, characters, or words. After the binarization, connected components in the binary image are detected. There also exist many methods for connected component detection. Some of them are described in detail in <ref> [29, 82] </ref>. We use a two-pass algorithm that scans each row of the image, labels black pixels, and uses an equivalence table to resolve conflicts in labels. <p> There are a few different algorithms to determine the threshold value defined by the method, but any such algorithm results in the same threshold value. We follow the algorithm given in <ref> [29, pages 20-23] </ref>. A threshold value applied on an image defines two groups of pixels: one group of pixels with values lower than the threshold and the other group of pixels with values higher than the threshold. The algorithm finds the threshold value that results in the most homogeneous groups. <p> We use this alternate method of finding the threshold value because it is simpler. Details on deriving (A.25) and (A.26) are given in <ref> [29, pages 21-22] </ref>. 150 Appendix B Examples of Address Block Locator Combination This appendix contains six examples of address block locator combination from 550 test cases of Experiment 1 described in Chapter 5.

Reference-contexts: Though classes and objects have quite differ 17 ent natures, they are both entities for which decisions from multiple methods are to be combined. A review of the research literature on multiple classifier combination is given by Ho <ref> [30] </ref>. We mainly discuss more recent research results in this area, where character recognition and word recognition are most intensively studied problems. We also review multiple classifier approaches to other classification problems such as face recognition, cytology screening, person identification, and oceanic signal classification. <p> The switch is controlled by a neural network that inputs an unknown pattern and generates a code that represents the states of the switches. Experiments on handwritten numerals show improvements over individual classifier performance. Ho et al. <ref> [30, 32] </ref> suggest a method for dynamic classifier selection based on image set partitioning. It divides the training set into several partitions by mutually exclusive conditions easily computable from an image. For each partition, classifier performance is measured and the best classifier is determined. <p> The four methods are entropy-based weighting of individual classifier outputs, combination of confidence factors in a manner similar to that used in MYCIN [10], majority voting, and averaging.

Reference-contexts: Handwritten numerals are recognized using the method and the results are compared with voting, the Bayesian method, and the Dempster-Shafer method. The experiments show that all four methods perform better than any individual classifier and that the proposed method generally performs best. Neural Network Huang and Suen <ref> [34] </ref> use a backpropagation neural network to combine the results of multiple classifiers that output measurement values. <p> For these reasons, measurement values from different locators need to be normalized before we attempt to combine them. There are methods for doing it so that measurement values all have a standard range such as from 0 to 1 <ref> [9, 34] </ref>. However, those methods cannot be used for abstract or rank-level output, where no measurement values are available to begin with. Therefore, we do not normalize measurement values, but evaluate them regarding the probabilistic confidence they indicate, based on the previous locator behavior.

Reference-contexts: One observation they make is that a better result is not necessarily achieved by combining classifiers with better individual performance, and in some cases combining more independent classifiers produces a better result.

Reference-contexts: Both approaches 23 are tested in user-dependent recognition of on-line handwritten characters. They con-clude that the Dempster-Shafer approach is better if there is not much training data, whereas the statistical approach is better when more training data is available. Huang and Suen <ref> [36] </ref> study a method for combination of classifiers which output class labels along with corresponding measurement values. A measurement value is converted into a confidence value which indicates the probability of the class with the measurement value being the true class, based on training samples. <p> Therefore, we do not normalize measurement values, but evaluate them regarding the probabilistic confidence they indicate, based on the previous locator behavior. We use the notion of objective confidence, which we briefly mentioned in Section 3.2. This was used in <ref> [36] </ref> for combination of measurement values produced by multiple classifiers at the measurement level. We extend the concept so that it is applicable to object locators.

Reference-contexts: Various approaches ranging from simple pattern classification to complex knowledge-based systems have been proposed in the literature. A survey of five early address block location systems is given by Koljonen and Glickman [48]. Brief reviews of approaches to address block location can also be found in <ref> [38, 54] </ref>. We classify approaches proposed so far into five major categories based on their most prominent features: knowledge-based systems, pattern recognition approach, geometric feature-based approach, texture analysis, and address syntax analysis. <p> Word merging and line merging on the result of the transition analysis generate `consistent' text blocks. For each block, local block features are calculated and weights assigned for feature values are combined into a confidence value of being the destination address. Jain and Bhattacharjee <ref> [38] </ref> view the address block location problem as a texture segmentation problem. Their algorithm uses Gabor filters [41] to obtain a three-cluster segmentation, corresponding to text, non-text, and boundaries between text and non-text regions.

Reference-contexts: For each group of 32 words, the enclosing rectangle is constructed, which is a candidate address block. No heuristic to identify the destination address block was implemented. Jain and Bhattacharjee <ref> [39] </ref> also propose a two-class (text and non-text) supervised pixel classification scheme. It applies four Gabor filters to extract texture features and uses a one-layer feedforward neural network with four input units and one output unit for pixel classification.

Reference-contexts: Connected components of the text pixels are grouped to form candidate address blocks among which the one closest to the image center is chosen as the destination address. Jain and Chen <ref> [40] </ref> use color and texture analysis to find address blocks on magazine covers. Their approach first performs a color thresholding to find white regions in the input color image. It then identifies text regions using Gabor filter-based texture segmentation.

Reference-contexts: Transition analysis techniques treat the stability of specific distances relating to characters as texture. Multichannel Gabor filtering <ref> [41] </ref> is another technique proposed for text segmentation from mail piece images using textures. Oriot et al. [67] use transition analysis to identify text regions for address block location. <p> For each block, local block features are calculated and weights assigned for feature values are combined into a confidence value of being the destination address.

Their algorithm uses Gabor filters <ref> [41] </ref> to obtain a three-cluster segmentation, corresponding to text, non-text, and boundaries between text and non-text regions. It then identifies connected components that belong to the text regions, and use projection profiles to identify groups of words.

Reference-contexts: Depending on how to measure the distance between two clusters, many different clustering methods are possible [102]. We discuss two simple examples. In the single linkage method or the nearest neighbor technique <ref> [44] </ref>, the distance between two clusters I and J is the shortest distance between any two points, one in each cluster: D IJ = min (d ij ) (4:5) where i and j are elements of clusters, and d ij is the distance between them. <p> Cluster sizes do not affect the distances in this method. On the contrary, the complete linkage method or the furthest neighbor technique <ref> [44] </ref> defines the distance between two clusters as the longest distance between any two points, one in each cluster: D IJ = max (d ij ) (4:6) In this method, if a cluster size is big, the distance between it and another cluster tends to be long.

Reference-contexts: The purpose of binarizing this image is to separate the pixels belonging to text from the background. A number of methods for document image binarization have been proposed so far. Evaluation of some of the methods is given in <ref> [45, 59, 71] </ref>. We use Otsu's thresholding method [68], which is one of the most commonly used document image binarization methods. Given a gray-level image, the method finds the global threshold value that maximizes `class separability' using the gray-level histogram of the image.

Reference-contexts: They claim that the performance of the combined system is definitely higher than that of pure statistical or structural systems. Kimura and Shridhar <ref> [47] </ref> use a statistical classifier and a structural classifier in two parallel combinations and four sequential combinations.

Combination methods capable of combining classifier decisions of different types are given in [9, 51]. We also observe that most approaches organize classifiers in a parallel fashion rather than a serial fashion. Serial combination of classifiers is investigated in <ref> [17, 47, 60] </ref>. Computational models for dynamically selecting the best classifier for an input pattern are proposed in [52, 98]. 2.1.4 Integrating Visual Modules Integration of vision modules is recognized as a promising approach towards robust solutions to many vision tasks, especially in low-level vision and 3-D reconstruction.

They identify desirable properties of combination including omnitype, mixed type, correlated classifier combination, redundant classifier elimination, model complexity control, and dynamic selection. <p> Remarks There are three possible types of classifier outputs.

Combination methods capable of combining classifier decisions of different types are given in <ref> [9, 51] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: They describe an example of applying this idea to choosing a different parameter set for the same regression model for combining classifiers, based on the agreement among top choice classes from classifiers. For each partition, different classifier weights are determined instead of determining the best classifier. Lee and Srihari <ref> [52] </ref> emphasize exploiting the dependency of classifier performance 18 on pattern characteristics in classifier combination. They propose two methods of dynamically selecting the most appropriate classifier for a given pattern: postcondi-tioned selection and preconditioned selection. <p> We also observe that most approaches organize classifiers in a parallel fashion rather than a serial fashion.

Jelinek et al. [43] present an address block location system with three separate channels of processing corresponding to red, green, and blue images.

Combination methods capable of combining classifier decisions of different types are given in [9, 51]. We also observe that most approaches organize classifiers in a parallel fashion rather than a serial fashion. Serial combination of classifiers is investigated in <ref> [17, 47, 60] </ref>. Computational models for dynamically selecting the best classifier for an input pattern are proposed in [52, 98]. 2.1.4 Integrating Visual Modules Integration of vision modules is recognized as a promising approach towards robust solutions to many vision tasks, especially in low-level vision and 3-D reconstruction.

Reference-contexts: For class set reranking, three 24 methods based on the highest rank, the Borda count, and logistic regression, respec-tively, are proposed. The methods are tested in degraded machine-printed character recognition and word recognition, and substantial improvements over individual classifier performance are reported. Matsui et al. <ref> [61] </ref> propose three combination rules for combining handwritten numeral recognition results which include candidate names, their order, and dissimilarity values. The proposed rules are voting on the first candidate, minimal sum of candidate orders, and minimal sum of dissimilarities.

Reference-contexts: Based on this information, the method dynamically activates region growing or edge detection modules. However, the method was not fully experimented with and only region growing part was implemented. Pixel-Level Thresholding Result Selection Mehtre and Chatterjee <ref> [62] </ref> propose a composite method for segmentation of fingerprint images. They introduce the directional method and the variance method which are combined at pixel level. The directional method fails on images with uniform regions, as the expression for the direction computation becomes undefined in such regions.

Reference-contexts: Many research results published on this topic is based on combining region and edge information, because they are often complementary in many image domains. Using Region and Edge Information Nazif and Levine <ref> [64] </ref> propose an expert system which integrates region and edge information by a set of heuristic rules. The system has both region analysis and boundary analysis rules.

Reference-contexts: Logistic Regression As linear regression is probably too simple to properly model the relation we are interested in, we investigate another regression model. When the dependent variable is binary, the shape of the response function is frequently sigmoidal <ref> [65] </ref>. Figure 3.4 shows such functions of the form E (Y ) = 1 + exp (fi 0 + fi 1 X) called logistic response functions. <p> Example Table 3.2 lists the same data as in Table 3.1, except the addition of the logit transformation results ( 0 ). Also, the 's were modified when = 0, such that = 1=(2N u ), because the logit transformation is undefined in those cases <ref> [65, 51 page 586] </ref>. Using the weighted least squares method, we have e i (u) = 1 + exp (6:9256 + 11:4137u) as the function to compute object confidence values for the locator. Figure 3.5 shows the result of fitting the regression function. <p> For example, textbooks on numerical anal ysis like [11] presents several methods for solving linear systems of equations. 143 A.1.2 Weighted Least Squares The description of the weighted least squares method is based on <ref> [65, pages 418, 585-586] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Because mail piece images from different streams have very different characteristics, a complex set of rules was required to process mail piece images that might come from any stream appropriately. Srihari et al. [87] describe an address block location system (ABLS) based on the blackboard model <ref> [19, 66] </ref> of problem solving. ABLS is composed of six parts: 28 mail statistics database, rule-based inference engine, control data, control mecha-nism, blackboard, and toolbox. It is a framework for coordinating a collection of specialized image and symbolic processing tools needed for mail piece image analysis.

Reference-contexts: Transition analysis techniques treat the stability of specific distances relating to characters as texture. Multichannel Gabor filtering [41] is another technique proposed for text segmentation from mail piece images using textures. Oriot et al. <ref> [67] </ref> use transition analysis to identify text regions for address block location. Possible text zones are isolated by analyzing two distances based on transitions: the horizontal distance between two successive `01' transitions and the vertical distance between a `01' transition and the following `10' transition.

Reference-contexts: The purpose of binarizing this image is to separate the pixels belonging to text from the background. A number of methods for document image binarization have been proposed so far. Evaluation of some of the methods is given in [45, 59, 71]. We use Otsu's thresholding method <ref> [68] </ref>, which is one of the most commonly used document image binarization methods. Given a gray-level image, the method finds the global threshold value that maximizes `class separability' using the gray-level histogram of the image. <p> max [ min (h (x i ); g (A i )] = max [min (h (x 1 ); g (A 1 )); min (h (x 2 ); g (A 2 )); = max [ min (0:7; 0:6); min (0:5; 0:6933); min (0:4; 1))] A.3 Minimizing Within-Group Variance Originally described in <ref> [68] </ref>, Otsu's thresholding method finds a threshold value for an input image using the gray value distribution in the image. There are a few different algorithms to determine the threshold value defined by the method, but any such algorithm results in the same threshold value.

Reference-contexts: The approach uses the method with the higher utility first and uses the method with the lower utility only when it is deemed necessary to do so. Region Ranking Modification by Segmentation Results Palumbo et al. <ref> [69] </ref> discuss an address block location system that uses three segmentation methods, one for machine-printed addresses and two for handwritten addresses. The segmentation results, three different sets of blocks, are processed together to produce a ranking of candidates for the destination address block. <p> Experiments are performed on mail piece images acquired from live mail. Arising from ABLS, a computational framework for object recognition in a complex visual environment is described in [93, 94]. Palumbo et al. <ref> [69, 70] </ref> present a real-time address block location system developed on the basis of ABLS. The system uses less image processing operations than ABLS and replaces the complex rule-based inference engine of ABLS with a more deterministic evidence combination method.

Reference-contexts: Considerable work on utilizing multiple classifiers has been done recently, which we review in Section 2.1.3. A review of some frameworks for integrating visual modules is given in Section 2.1.4. 2.1.1 Combining Document Object Locators A few address block location systems <ref> [43, 70, 56] </ref> attempt to combine multiple document object location results. Jelinek et al. [43] present an address block location system with three separate channels of processing corresponding to red, green, and blue images. Each channel performs an identical sequence of processing steps. <p> Each channel performs an identical sequence of processing steps. The `multiple channel reconciliation' module merges and sorts three lists of top ten candidates, one from each channel, into the final list of top ten candidates. Palumbo et al. <ref> [70] </ref> discuss an address block location system that uses four segmentation methods designed for different text types and/or based on different segmentation techniques. This system processes the four segmentation results independently using the same ranking method, to derive four different sets of ranked candidate blocks. <p> If two top choices from different rankings occupy almost identical regions, they are treated as one candidate. Lii et al. [56] describe an extended version of the system presented in <ref> [70] </ref> that uses five segmentation methods. The system generates five independent ranking results. From each ranking, the first block with the city, state, and Zip Code information is collected. <p> If only one block is collected and its location is reasonable it will be taken as the destination address. Otherwise, the combination results as generated in <ref> [70] </ref> will be output. In short, this system collects from the initial rankings those candidates showing the address syntax and reranks them. Remarks The approaches described are of limited combination capability in that only the top choices are combined and the same ranking method is used on all segmentation results. <p> Experiments are performed on mail piece images acquired from live mail. Arising from ABLS, a computational framework for object recognition in a complex visual environment is described in [93, 94]. Palumbo et al. <ref> [69, 70] </ref> present a real-time address block location system developed on the basis of ABLS. The system uses less image processing operations than ABLS and replaces the complex rule-based inference engine of ABLS with a more deterministic evidence combination method. <p> However, address syntax can be used to verify candidate address blocks with the aid of a character recognition module. Lii et al. [56] describe an extended version of the system presented in <ref> [70] </ref> that uses character recognition and address syntax. The system locates word candidates and assign a syntactic tag to each word by character recognition and word matching. Finding address blocks is formulated as a consistent labeling problem [58] using the tags and address syntax models. <p> Accordingly, a good solution to the address block location problem is significant to postal automation. More detail on the role of the ARU and the address block location subsystem in postal automation is given in <ref> [70] </ref>. The problem is also a challenging document object location problem for which a number of solutions have been proposed, as we reviewed in Section 2.2. 85 Constraints We place a few constraints on the problem.

Reference-contexts: They claim that if the weights are chosen right, the actual combination approach does not matter. Experiments with line drawing object images show that using multiple simple methods enable more objects to be recognized.

Reference-contexts: But carrying out the general principle is quite challenging and this may explain the sparsity of the literature on integrated techniques." Pavlidis <ref> [73, page 224] </ref> expresses another view: "The main obstacle to integration of methodologies is that various approaches are offered as `panaceas' rather than as members of a toolset." These quotations help explain why integration of approaches to vision problems has not been pursued actively in the past.

Reference-contexts: Lastly, Chapter 6 gives research conclusions and discusses future research directions. 10 Chapter 2 Literature Review In their paper on combining two techniques for segmentation, Pavlidis and Liow <ref> [74, page 225] </ref> point out: "The general principle of integration is well accepted in vision. <p> The interior of a certain region has uniform features and no edges while its boundary is an edge and not uniform. Pixels not belonging to any certain region are 13 classified as uncertain. Using Edge Information to Improve Region-Based Segmentation The studies reported in <ref> [1, 24, 74, 97] </ref> use the strategy of using edge information to improve region-based segmentation or to control a region growing process. In effect, the segmentation result of one method is modified or improved using the result of another method. <p> Fua and Hanson [24] apply high-level domain knowledge and an edge-based technique to select the best segmentation from a series of images segmented based on regions. They apply the method to extracting instances of generic shapes such as buildings, roads, and vegetation clumps. Pavlidis and Liow <ref> [74] </ref> present a method that combines region growing and edge detection for image segmentation. The method starts with a split-and-merge algorithm in which parameters are set up so that an oversegmented image results.

Reference-contexts: Connected Component Detection Connected components of a mail piece image usually correspond to character strokes, characters, or words. After the binarization, connected components in the binary image are detected. There also exist many methods for connected component detection.

Reference-contexts: They conjecture that the reason for the improvement is that networks which have fallen into different local minima will perform poorly in different regions of the feature space, and the errors will be weakly correlated. Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory Shlien <ref> [86] </ref> proposes the use of multiple binary decision tree classifiers where each tree is designed using a different feature selection criterion.

Class confidence values are derived using a method similar to that used by Shlien <ref> [86] </ref>, which are combined by a heuristic method and a Dempster-Shafer theory based method.

Segmentation results on a natural scene and a blocks world image are shown and compared with histogram splitting and split-and-merge results. Sugiyama and Abe <ref> [89] </ref> propose an image segmentation method that uses both edge and region information to partition an image into `certain' and `uncertain' regions. The interior of a certain region has uniform features and no edges while its boundary is an edge and not uniform.

Reference-contexts: A multilayer perceptron takes outputs of several classifiers, some of them properly transformed beforehand, and outputs a decision vector indicating confidence values for all classes. Experiments are performed with handwritten digit recognition. Fuzzy Integral Tahani and Keller <ref> [90] </ref> give theoretical developments of an evidence fusion technique in computer vision based on the fuzzy integral [88]. Experiments in recognizing an armored personnel carrier and two types of tanks from forward looking infrared images are performed. <p> It was first developed by Sugeno [88] and has been used in several information fusion problems <ref> [3, 4, 12, 90] </ref>. Fuzzy integrals are described in detail in Section A.2. To use fuzzy integrals in our theory, we first need to determine what the fuzzy densities will be. <p> A.2 Fuzzy Measures and Fuzzy Integrals We describe fuzzy measures and fuzzy integrals following the development of Tahani and Keller <ref> [90] </ref>. Suppose we have a set of information sources X = fx 1 ; : : : ; x n g. These sources provide measurements of some phenomenon, which can be probabilities or beliefs that some condition holds, scores for some object, or decision values. <p> Then we finally use the fuzzy integral to generate a consensus decision. Given g i values, expanding (A.20) results in a polynomial equation of order (n1) in . Both Leszczynski [55] and Tahani and Keller <ref> [90] </ref> prove that for a fixed set of fg i g; 0 &lt; g i &lt; 1, there exists a unique 2 (1; 1); 6= 0, which satisfies (A.20). Therefore, we can always find a value that will enable us to use the fuzzy integral.

Reference-contexts: The methods are holistic word recognition, segment/recognize with statistical classifier, and segment/recognize with neural classifier. They experiment with three different combination configurations for combining the three methods, each one possessing a different degree of parallelism. Tumer and Ghosh <ref> [91] </ref> employ two neural network classifiers whose outputs are interpreted as Bayesian a posteriori probabilities and combine their results. Two separate feature sets are used, resulting in four classifiers in effect. Each of the six possible pairs of classifiers are tested in experiments on classifying underwater passive sonar data set.

Reference-contexts: Experimental results on recognizing machine-printed characters show performance 20 improvements. Rogova [81] presents a method for combining neural network classifiers based on the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. Two experiments are performed: one on a private database and the other on the NIST database <ref> [92] </ref>. In each experiment, three classifiers are employed and several combinations are tested. One observation they make is that a better result is not necessarily achieved by combining classifiers with better individual performance, and in some cases combining more independent classifiers produces a better result.

Reference-contexts: It is a framework for coordinating a collection of specialized image and symbolic processing tools needed for mail piece image analysis. Experiments are performed on mail piece images acquired from live mail. Arising from ABLS, a computational framework for object recognition in a complex visual environment is described in <ref> [93, 94] </ref>. Palumbo et al. [69, 70] present a real-time address block location system developed on the basis of ABLS. The system uses less image processing operations than ABLS and replaces the complex rule-based inference engine of ABLS with a more deterministic evidence combination method. <p> This eliminates the need for checking the possibility of wrongly placed mail pieces, which is not what we are interested in. A technique to deal with incorrectly oriented mail pieces in address block location is described in <ref> [93, 94] </ref>. The third constraint is realistic because a correctly addressed mail piece should have only one destination address. By this constraint, we also exclude mail piece images without a destination address.

Reference-contexts: However, the authors do not discuss how to determine the weights. Selectively Using the Second Segmentation Method Having a secondary segmentation method and using it only when required can be efficient. Wang and Srihari <ref> [94] </ref> use two segmentation methods for address block location, one for machine-printed text (MSEG) and the other for handwritten text (HSEG). MSEG is always applied first because it is faster and more mail pieces have a machine-printed destination address than a handwritten one. <p> It is a framework for coordinating a collection of specialized image and symbolic processing tools needed for mail piece image analysis.

Reference-contexts: It can be considered as a case of the unified measure of uncertainty introduced by Wang <ref> [95] </ref>: C (x) = w where C is the fuzzy concept to be measured, w is the weight of all relevant (either positive or negative) evidence, and w + is the weight of all positive evidence.

Reference-contexts: They conclude that fusion at certain level has typical properties which favor certain fusion methods. Wong and Frei <ref> [96] </ref> suggest a scheme to combine three methods for object recognition. The first method uses geometric features, the second is appropriate for jagged structures in objects, and the third is for objects described well with a skeleton.

Reference-contexts: The interior of a certain region has uniform features and no edges while its boundary is an edge and not uniform. Pixels not belonging to any certain region are 13 classified as uncertain. Using Edge Information to Improve Region-Based Segmentation The studies reported in <ref> [1, 24, 74, 97] </ref> use the strategy of using edge information to improve region-based segmentation or to control a region growing process. In effect, the segmentation result of one method is modified or improved using the result of another method. <p> Results are shown using tool images and aerial photograph images. They conclude that the combination of two methods yields far better results than those of a single method. Xiaohan et al. <ref> [97] </ref> use local gradient information to control a region growing process. Edge information influences the region growing process via a parameter that reflects the sensitivity to edge pixels.

Reference-contexts: Dynamic Classifier Selection The principle of dynamic classifier selection is to apply the classifier that is determined to be most appropriate for a given input pattern. Some methods of realizing this capability have been proposed. Xu et al. <ref> [98] </ref> suggest a method of classifier combination called the `associative switch.' Classifiers output a single class or reject the input. Attached to the end of each classifier is a switch controlling whether the classifier output will pass through to the final result. <p> We also observe that most approaches organize classifiers in a parallel fashion rather than a serial fashion. Serial combination of classifiers is investigated in [17, 47, 60]. Computational models for dynamically selecting the best classifier for an input pattern are proposed in <ref> [52, 98] </ref>. 2.1.4 Integrating Visual Modules Integration of vision modules is recognized as a promising approach towards robust solutions to many vision tasks, especially in low-level vision and 3-D reconstruction. We review a few studies of this sort.

Reference-contexts: To use the fuzzy integral for combination, distance measures in the range [0,1) are converted into probabilities using the method suggested by Xu et al. <ref> [99] </ref>, and error rates are used as the basis of classifier reliabil-ities. The combined classifier shows a significant improvement in the error rate. Cao et al. [12] use the fuzzy integral to combine results of multiple character classifiers. They propose a method to assign classifier relevance using classifier performance matrices. <p> Many other studies propose and experiment with multiple combination methods. In general, these works attempt to compare effects of different combination methods for a pattern recognition problem, rather than advocate one method. Xu et al. <ref> [99] </ref> investigate the classifier combination problem systematically and describe various approaches to the problem. Three levels in classifier output information are defined: the abstract level, the rank level, and the measurement level. One approach is proposed for combining measurement-level classifiers such as Bayesian, k-nearest neighbor, and various distance classifiers. <p> We first note that there are three levels (or types) of results that can be generated by object locators. Xu et al. <ref> [99] </ref> identifies three levels in classifier 37 output information. Analogous output levels can be defined regarding locator output information as follows: 1. Abstract level : A locator outputs a unique object, without any more informa tion. 2.

Reference-contexts: These approaches neither perform rule-based inference nor use classifiers. Yeh et al. <ref> [100] </ref> present an approach of this kind. The Laplacian operator is applied and connected components are detected and merged to eliminate spurious ones. For each remaining component, several local features are calculated.

Reference-contexts: These features are used to segment a scene and label the regions as sky, tree, roof, walls, grass, and road. Based on each feature, the degrees of membership of each pixel in the labels are computed. A two-layer neural network combines the membership values using the fl-model <ref> [101] </ref> as the aggregation operator, which allows varying degrees of compensation between the union and intersection. Local Decision Integration Etemad et al. [20, 21] present a document page segmentation algorithm which classifies regions into text, image, and graphics.

Reference-contexts: The blocks are then evaluated using their locations and an ordered list of candidate blocks are output. Thus the locator is a rank-level locator. 4.5.1 Block Segmentation According to Zupan <ref> [102, page 4] </ref>, "Clusters are groups of objects linked together according to some rules. <p> Block segmentation is done by cutting the tree (or stopping generating the tree) at an appropriate point based on the desired number of clusters or certain other conditions. Depending on how to measure the distance between two clusters, many different clustering methods are possible <ref> [102] </ref>. We discuss two simple examples.
