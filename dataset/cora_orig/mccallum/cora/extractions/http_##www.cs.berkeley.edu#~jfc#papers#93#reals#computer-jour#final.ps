Abstract: Recently there has been a lot of activity in algorithms that work over real closed fields, and that perform such calculations as quantifier elimination or computing connected components of semi-algebraic sets. A cornerstone of this work is a symbolic sign determination algorithm due to Ben-Or, Kozen and Reif [2]. In this paper we describe a new sign determination method based on the earlier algorithm, but with two advantages: (i) It is faster in the univariate case, and (ii) In the general case, it allows purely symbolic quantifier elimination in pseudo-polynomial time. By purely symbolic, we mean that it is possible to eliminate a quantified variable from a system of polynomials no matter what the coefficient values are. The previous methods required the coefficients to be themselves polynomials in other variables. Our new method allows transcendental functions or derivatives to appear in the coefficients. Another corollary of the new sign-determination algorithm is a very simple, practical algorithm for deciding existentially-quantified formulae of the theory of the reals. We present an algorithm that has a bit complexity of n (k+1) d O(k) (c log n) (1+*) randomized, or n (k+1) d O(k 2 ) c (1+*) deterministic, for any * &gt; 0. Where n is the number of polynomial constraints in the defining formula, k is the number of variables, d is a bound on the degree, c bounds the bit length of the coefficients. The algorithm makes no general position assumptions, and its constants are much smaller than other recent quantifier elimination methods.

INTRODUCTION Real quantifier elimination algorithms have enjoyed a revival in interest in the last few years, and an important impetus was the parallel sign determination algorithm in <ref> [2] </ref>. Two of the latest quantifier elimination algorithms, [21] and [14] have very good theoretical complexity. Indeed the bounds in [21] are near the best that can be hoped for the important case of problems with a bounded number of quantifier alternations. <p> Their work builds on a large body of earlier papers, dating from Tarski's original paper [24], and following a line of papers that include [23], [9], [11], [10], <ref> [2] </ref>, [3] and others.

Both [21] and [14], like the author's earlier paper [4], make use of a sign-determination lemma due to Ben-Or, Kozen and Reif [2]. This lemma, henceforth called "BKR", takes a univariate polynomial p (s), and polynomials q 1 (s); : : : ; q n (s), and returns k sign sequences 2 f; 0; +g n , where k is the number of real roots of p (s) = 0. <p> One of the major contributions of <ref> [2] </ref> is a clever method to avoid all this calculation. <p> To solve the system, we need only find 3m independent rows of this submatrix, and solve a 3m fi 3m system. Finding these rows might potentially take a long time, but <ref> [2] </ref> show that one can use m independent rows from R n from the previous step, so the whole calculation takes polynomial time (actually, the description above is for a simplified sequential version of their algorithm, the original [2] uses divide-and-conquer to run in NC). <p> Finding these rows might potentially take a long time, but <ref> [2] </ref> show that one can use m independent rows from R n from the previous step, so the whole calculation takes polynomial time (actually, the description above is for a simplified sequential version of their algorithm, the original [2] uses divide-and-conquer to run in NC). This is fine for univariate problems, since one never needs to make more than 3mn Sturm queries. But it is not known in advance which queries will be made, so the number of potential queries is still 3 n . <p> But it is not known in advance which queries will be made, so the number of potential queries is still 3 n . This causes problems when one tries to use the algorithm symbolically. This wasnt fully appreciated in <ref> [2] </ref>, and while their uni-variate analysis is correct, the multivariate generalization given there is not. The present work was originally motivated by an attempt to correct this error in the simplest way possible, namely by finding good a priori bounds on the number of potential Sturm queries.

Reference-contexts: For example, infinitesimal extensions of the reals, which are themselves real closed fields, are extensively used in recent algorithms for computing connected components of semi-algebraic sets [3], [15], [11], [5], <ref> [6] </ref>. BKR also seems to perform well in implementations, especially if the polynomial p (s) has few real roots. <p> A formula B (A i ; : : : ; A n ) is said to be in monotone standard form if the boolean function B is monotone, and all atomic formulae A i are either (f i = 0) or (f i &gt; 0). As shown in <ref> [6] </ref> we can go futher and assume that the formula has log depth. But that will not be of advantage to us for this simple algorithm. <p> Typically, an element of R (*; ffi) is represented as a polynomial in * and ffi. The degree of such elements will typically be O (d O (k) ), and clearly with 3 or 4 infinitesimals, each field operation is enormously expensive. But in <ref> [6] </ref> a method is described for computing with infinitesimals which costs only slightly more than integer arithmetic in typical cases. The idea is to do arithemetic using straight line programs, and recover only the lowest degree rational coefficient of the field element by differentiation. <p> Then the set S 0 defined by this formula is closed and bounded, therefore compact. By the results of <ref> [6] </ref> the connected components of the sign-invariant sets of S 0 (but not of S 0 itself, that requires two more infinitesimals) are in one-to-one correspondence with those of S.

Non-Emptiness for Compact, Regular Sets Once we know that the set S 0 is compact and regularly stratified by the signs of polynomials f i in B 0 , it is easy to decide if it is non-empty. <p> The coordinates x 0 2 ; : : : ; x 0 a basis for the k 1 dimensional linear space which is the kernel of . The process of solving this system in the limit is described in [4] and <ref> [6] </ref>, and involves computing the u-resultant of the system, arranging it in powers of , and retaining the lowest degree coefficient. <p> We must pay attention to the cost of the arithmetic over the field extension Q [*; ffi; ; ]. This is of course, a polynomial which is already taken account in the bound above, but the actual time may still be prohibitive. As explained in <ref> [6] </ref> however, in most situations, we can perform this arithmetic for about the same cost as integer arithmetic. 4.7.2. Deterministic Version For the deterministic version, we assume a and are defined using infinitesimals. Specifically, we assume that a 1 a n ffi * 1 k &gt; 0 are all infinitesimals. <p> Perspective There are three reasons why this method offers better practical efficiency than other methods. The first is the way it deals with infinitesimals, as described in <ref> [6] </ref>. The second is in the form of the bound, which has a "combinatorial" part n k+1 and an algebraic part d O (k) .

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, this would be a less practical algorithm than the one described here, because the constant factors in the O (k) are larger, which will normally swamp the factor of n difference. Finally, although we do not discuss it here, recent work on sparse resultants <ref> [7] </ref>, [8] make it possible to eliminate large numbers of variables in a reasonable amount of time. The issue of the elimination method is often neglected in real quantifier elimination work, because bounds of the form d O (k) are in some sense optimal.

Reference-contexts: Their work builds on a large body of earlier papers, dating from Tarski's original paper [24], and following a line of papers that include <ref> [23] </ref>, [9], [11], [10], [2], [3] and others. Both [21] and [14], like the author's earlier paper [4], make use of a sign-determination lemma due to Ben-Or, Kozen and Reif [2].

Reference-contexts: Indeed the bounds in [21] are near the best that can be hoped for the important case of problems with a bounded number of quantifier alternations.
