Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for verifying control laws using phase-space geometric modeling of dynamical systems. The algorithm evolves a hierarchically-refined bound of system nonlinear dynamics and can address practical concerns such as sensor, actuator, and modeling uncertainties in a systematic manner. The algorithm has been applied to verifying a control law for a magnetic levitation system, and the computational results are compared against the performance of the actual physical system.

Reference-contexts: This suggests that a larger disturbance would cause the system to enter an uncontrollable region, and fail to return to the equilibrium point. Thus, for the limited region of phase space explored, the theoretical and actual results are similar. 4. RELATED WORK The HyTech system <ref> (Alur et al., 1996) </ref> uses convex polyhedra to represent regions of a hybrid system and shares the concept of verification through exploration of the pre-images of the desired goal states. HyTech allows the expression of properties to be verified as explicit mathematical formulas.

Reference-contexts: One of the simplest and most efficient ways to find a suitable p c is to compute the minimum and maximum values for each component of F over the cell c and form a bounding box for f (c) using these values. In hybrid systems terms (see e.g. <ref> (Branicky, 1995) </ref>), each cell can be thought of as a discrete state, and the bounding polytope is determined by approximating system dynamics with a rectangular differential inclusion.

Reference-contexts: However, the geometric approach used here allows for a more straightforward representation of real-world uncertainties. Furthermore, our algorithm is guaranteed to terminate, and allows for a systematic refinement of approximation of dynamics. Recently, several researchers suggested verification techniques based on projecting phase-space regions. In <ref> (Greenstreet and Mitchell, 1998) </ref>, the authors described a method for computing projection polyhedra obtained from integrating initial regions. While an efficient and exact algorithm exists for two-dimensional linear systems with convex spaces, a general higher-dimensional polyhedra have to be reconstructed from a series of two-dimensional subspace projections.

Reference-contexts: The partitioning of the phase space in step 1 is arbitrary; however, regular partitions are often used, and certain types of control suggest preferred partitions. For example, control based on cell maps suggests an initial partition identical to the one used to generate the cell maps <ref> (Hsu, 1987) </ref>. Determination of the initial controllable region requires a bit more effort. There are two basic approaches.
