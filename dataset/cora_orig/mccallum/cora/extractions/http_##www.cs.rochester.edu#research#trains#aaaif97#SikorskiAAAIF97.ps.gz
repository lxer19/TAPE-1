Abstract: Other than speech acts occurring at the utterance level, there exist higher-level dialogue actions such as those involving the coordination of problem solving activities between dialogue participants. This paper describes a taxonomy of actions at this problem solving level, and a scheme for annotating collected corpora to capture these problem solving behaviors. We describe a methodology for performing the annotation and include results of applying these tags to the TRAINS-93 corpus.
