Reference-contexts: Note that the above definition is the same as one with (2) replaced by (4) If G and H are cographs, then so is their join G + H. There is a linear time algorithm to identify whether a graph is a cograph (see <ref> [3] </ref>). In the case of a positive answer, the algorithm also gives a parsing tree. Therefore, we have the following consequences.

OSF, 3SF) stands for sun-free (resp. odd-sun-free, 3-sun-free). SF-chordal graphs are also called strongly chordal graphs by Farber (see <ref> [6] </ref>).

Farber <ref> [6] </ref> proved that G is a strongly chordal graph if and only if every vertex induced subgraph of G has a simple vertex. Theorem 5.1 (G) 2 for any OSF-chordal graph G with maximum degree . Proof. First, (G) 2 (G 2 ) 2 by Lemma 2.4.

Reference-contexts: Chordal graphs have - 8 - been extensively studied as a subclass of perfect graphs (see <ref> [8] </ref>). For any graph G, (G) denotes the chromatic number of G and !(G) the maximum size of a clique in G. It is easy to see that !(G) (G) for any graph G.

Reference-contexts: A k-L (2; 1)-labeling is an L (2; 1)-labeling such that no label is greater than k. The L (2; 1)-labeling number of G, denoted by (G), is the smallest number k such that G has a k-L (2; 1)-labeling. Griggs and Yeh <ref> [9] </ref> determined the exact values of (P n ), (C n ), and (W n ), where P n is a path of n vertices, C n is a cycle of n vertices, and W n is an n-wheel obtained from C n by adding a new vertex adjacent to all <p> For the n-cube Q n , Jonas [11] showed that n + 3 (Q n ). Griggs and Yeh <ref> [9] </ref> showed that (Q n ) 2n + 1 for n 5. They also determined (Q n ) for n 5 and conjectured that the lower bound n + 3 is the actual value of (Q n ) for n 3. <p> As a consequence, (Q n ) 2n for n 3. For a tree T with maximum degree 1, Griggs and Yeh <ref> [9] </ref> showed that (T ) is either + 1 or + 2. They proved that the L (2; 1)-labeling problem is NP-complete for general graphs and conjectured that the problem is also NP-complete for trees. - 2 - For a general graph G of maximum degree , Griggs and Yeh [9] <p> <ref> [9] </ref> showed that (T ) is either + 1 or + 2. They proved that the L (2; 1)-labeling problem is NP-complete for general graphs and conjectured that the problem is also NP-complete for trees. - 2 - For a general graph G of maximum degree , Griggs and Yeh [9] proved that (G) 2 + 2. The upper bound was improved to be (G) 2 + 2 3 when G is 3-connected and (G) 2 when G is of diameter two. Griggs and Yeh conjectured that (G) 2 in general. <p> Q.E.D.

They also conjectured that it is NP-complete to determine if (G) = . On the contrary, this section gives a polynomial time algorithm to determine if (T ) = . <p> Next, check if there is a leaf x whose unique neighbor y has degree less than . If there is, then T x also has maximum degree .

Determining (T ) is then the same as determining (T x). Continue this process until any leaf of the tree is adjacent to a vertex of degree .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The channel assignment problem is to assign a channel (nonnegative integer) to each radio transmitter so that interfering transmitters are assigned channels whose separation is not in a set of disallowed separations.

Reference-contexts: The upper bound was improved to be (G) 2 + 2 3 when G is 3-connected and (G) 2 when G is of diameter two. Griggs and Yeh conjectured that (G) 2 in general. To study this conjecture, Sakai <ref> [17] </ref> considered the class of chordal graphs. He showed that (G) ( + 3) 2 =4 for any chordal graph G. For a unit interval graph G, which is a very special chordal graph, he also proved that 2 (G) 2 (G) 2 (G).
