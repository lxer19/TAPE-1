Abstract: INTRODUCTION We describe the design and implementation of a prototype When we think of the use of head-mounted displays and 3D heads-up window system intended for use in a 3D environ- interaction devices to present virtual worlds, it is often in ment. Our system includes a see-through head-mounted terms of environments populated solely by 3D objects. display that runs a full X server whose image is overlaid on There are many situations, however, in which 2D text and the user's view of the physical world. The user's head is graphics of the sort supported by current window systems tracked so that the display indexes into a large X bitmap, can be useful components of these environments. This is effectively placing the user inside a display space that is especially true in the case of the many applications that run mapped onto part of a surrounding virtual sphere. By under an industry standard window system such as X [13]. tracking the user's body, and interpreting head motion rela- While we might imagine porting or enhancing a significant tive to it, we create a portable information surround that X application to take advantage of the 3D capabilities of a envelopes the user as they move about. virtual world, the effort and cost may not be worth the return, especially if the application is inherently 2D. We support three kinds of windows implemented on top of Therefore, we have been exploring how we can incorporate the X server: windows fixed to the head-mounted display, an existing 2D window system within a 3D virtual world. windows fixed to the information surround, and windows fixed to locations and objects in the 3D world.

In this paper we first present related work and provide an overview of our system. Next, we describe the different kinds of windows that we support, and show how these windows can be used to advantage by a simple hypermedia system.
