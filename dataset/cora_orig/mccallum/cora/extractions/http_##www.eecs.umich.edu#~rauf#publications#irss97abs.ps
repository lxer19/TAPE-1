Abstract: In this paper, we consider soft-output multiuser demodulation for asynchronous CDMA channels with coding and interleaving. First, we derive an optimum soft-output multiuser estimation (OSOME) algorithm for linearly-modulated Gaussian CDMA channels. The forward-recursive algorithm generates a posteriori probabilities (APP) for modulator-input symbols given the received signal, which can be fed directly to single-user soft-decision decoders. Second, we outline a reduced-state soft-output multiuser estimation (RSOME) scheme, with complexity exponential in a parameter called memory order chosen arbitrarily (smaller than channel memory). These algorithms can be employed with conventional matched filtering and do not require noise whitening. Finally we present simulation results of a four-user coded asynchronous CDMA system. The results indicate that the OSOME algorithm achieves a 0:4 0:6 dB gain over soft-output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA) [3] in a power controlled environment and the reduced-state schemes provide a desirable performance-complexity tradeoff. Multiuser CDMA systems suffer from multiple-access interference (MAI), noise and other channel impairments. Two techniques are generally used to combat MAI. The first is multiuser demodulation for which there has been considerable research. The second technique is the combination of coding and interleaving. In order to make the most of error control coding, the demodulator must provide soft-inputs to the decoders in the form of likelihoods, symbol APP's, erasures, etc.. Unfortunately most multiuser detection algorithms ignore the possibility of generating this reliability information and concentrate instead on minimizing the demodulated error rate. In this paper, we attempt to derive multiuser algorithms that estimate code symbol APP's and can be effectively combined with error control coding and interleaving.

Hayes et. al. derived an optimal symbol-by-symbol detection (OSSD) algorithm for ISI channels with correlated noise (after matched filtering) <ref> [2] </ref>. They and other authors, however, over-estimated the complexity of this algorithm. We derive an optimum soft-output multiuser estimation (OSOME) algorithm based on their scheme.

Reference-contexts: These conditional decisions are fed back in the next iteration to compute the branch met-rics. This method of trellis truncation works very well in causal interference (that arises in a whitened Gaussian CDMA channel) <ref> [5] </ref>. However, due to the non-causal nature of multiuser interference resulting from conventional matched filtering, the conditional decisions are rendered interference limited. Thus, the performance of the reduced-state scheme becomes highly interference limited if these conditional decisions are used in computing branch met-rics.
