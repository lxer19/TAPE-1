Abstract: To ensure a high level of human health protection the huge amount of data gathered day by day by the physicians of the health service have to be analyzed in an efficient way. The current statistical and numerical methods allow only a limited analysis of these data. In this paper we discuss the visualization of huge data sets of multiparameter health data with geographical and temporal dependence as an efficient tool for the analysis of human health data and present some new solutions. Furthermore, we describe the visualization system MedVis which has been developed for the visualization of health data of the German state Mecklenburg-Vorpommern as part of a tele-consultation-system for the monitoring of acute health risk.

Reference-contexts: Therefore the main concern is the display of the different spatial granularities. Maps are very suit-able for the display of geographic spatial dependence because they have a low level of abstraction which allows an intuitive perception of spatial relations. Another possibility are cartograms (see <ref> [Dorling94] </ref>) which are `maps in which a particular exaggeration is deliberately chosen', e.g. geographical units represented by Chernoff faces. However, when the number of parameters is large information can not always be displayed at a map. Therefore we distinguish in [Schumann96] between the direct or indirect display of spatial dependence.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, icons can be positioned exactly and are therefore very suitable for the display of spatial relations. Other techniques are for instance geometric techniques,e.g. Hyperslice [WL93]and Parallel Coordinates [Inselberg94], hierarchical techniques,e.g. World-within-Worlds <ref> [FeBe90] </ref> and Treemap [Johnson93], among other. Apart from the identification of extrema and frequencies for single parameter the identification of multivariate correlations is an important interpretation goal for the analysis of the health data and different visualization techniques have to be used for quantitative and qualitative analysis of correlations.

Reference-contexts: The task of the tele-consultation-system is to provide physicians and future health risks in a geographical region (see <ref> [Gierl96] </ref>). The input data CD for this system are updated weeklely by the Health Insurance Companies and are converted into cases, i.e. sequences of the time series, which are classified into prototypes of cases. These data form the case base.

Reference-contexts: These data form the case base. The simulator searches for the nearest case to an current case in the case base by using the Case-Based-Reasoning (CBR) approach (see <ref> [Gierl97] </ref>) and tries to forecast the further course of the current case.

Reference-contexts: In particular the iconographic approach is widely used, i.e. `mapping data to an object the icon whose attributes are under the control of the various fields of the data record' <ref> [Grienstein95] </ref> . Moreover, icons can be positioned exactly and are therefore very suitable for the display of spatial relations. Other techniques are for instance geometric techniques,e.g. Hyperslice [WL93]and Parallel Coordinates [Inselberg94], hierarchical techniques,e.g. World-within-Worlds [FeBe90] and Treemap [Johnson93], among other.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the functionality of IRIS-Explorer can be extended with own modules, e.g. we have developed modules for additional visualization techniques, focusing functionality and the input and visualization of maps. We are using the NetCDF-format (see <ref> [RDE93] </ref>) for data input, which allows also the storage of additional meta information about the data, e.g. maxima and minima of parameters, and preprocessed data, e.g. numerical correlation information.
