Abstract: Graphs are often used to model complex systems and to visualize relationships, and this often involves drawing a graph in the plane. For this, a variety of algorithms and mathematical tools have been used with varying success. We demonstrate why it is often more natural and more meaningful to view higher dimensional representations of graphs. We present some of the theory and problems associated with constructing such representations, and we briefly describe some visualization tools which are now available for experimental research in this area.

Reference-contexts: This theorem has been generalized in a couple of ways. It was generalized in <ref> [1] </ref> to prove that although the crossing number and rectilinear crossing number of graphs are (in general) unrelated, for graphs of bounded degree, they are bounded as functions of each other. This is yet another example of how planar graphs can be used to draw nonplanar graphs.

Reference-contexts: We focus on several mathematical problems associated with drawing graphs. The problems and methods of solution are as diverse as the objectives including constraints on the area of the drawing, the length and shape of edges, and beauty. What is a graph? We quote one of the standard texts <ref> [2] </ref> directly: A graph G is an ordered triple (V (G); E (G); G ) consisting of a nonempty set V (G) of vertices, a set E (G), disjoint from V (G), of edges, and an incidence function G that associates with each edge of G an unordered pair of (not

Reference-contexts: Chilakamarri <ref> [7] </ref> has characterized the unit-distance graphs in &lt; d in terms of Z d . The main open problem in this area concerns coloring unit-distance graphs; that is, we assign a color to each vertex of the graph so that no two adjacent vertices get the same color.

Reference-contexts: This is yet another example of how planar graphs can be used to draw nonplanar graphs. The generalization of Tutte's theorem to higher dimensions seems suprisingly tricky. Some results are presented in <ref> [8] </ref> where some nice drawings of cell complexes such as the one shown in Figure 3 are constructed. 2.3 Connectivity Let G be a graph with n vertices. <p> This leaves open the problem of embedding graphs efficiently in higher dimensions. In fact, so far no one has even proposed a definition of convexity for graphs embedded in 3-space. Some minor results can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: To our knowledge no work has been done in this direction. 4 Grid Embeddings Recently, much attention has been focused on embedding planar graphs on a small grid (see <ref> [9] </ref>, [17], [20], [25]). This problem is related to certain problems in VLSI layout design. Of course, for a rectilinear drawing of any graph (even nonplanar graphs) it suffices to specify the positions of the vertices. <p> Consequently, some rather jagged layouts are produced for some generally well-behaved graphs (see Figure 5). Is there a way to avoid this? Sometimes. Chrobak <ref> [9] </ref> has shown that every 3-connected planar graph has a convex embedding on a polynomial-size grid. This leaves open the problem of embedding graphs efficiently in higher dimensions. In fact, so far no one has even proposed a definition of convexity for graphs embedded in 3-space.
