Reference-contexts: After merging his and van Leeuwen's list with a list of Guibas and Stolfi, and making other updates, he released it to the community in 1987. At that time, Edelsbrun-ner conceived of a utopian community-owned and -maintained bibliography, and solicited support for his idea <ref> [Ede87] </ref>. Pessimists will be surprised to learn that, five years later, the bibliography is thriving. After stewardship by Edelsbrunner, and then briefly by myself, it has been managed for the past two years by Bill Jones at the University of Saskatchewan.
