Title: Measuring relational complexity in oddity discrimination tasks  
Author: Steven Phillips 
Affiliation: Electrotechnical Laboratory  
Abstract: A relation-based theory of cognition proposes that cognitive capacity is limited, in part, by the maximum arity of a relation that can be processed in working memory (Halford, 1993; Halford, Wilson, & Phillips, submitted). Children below age five are limited to binary relations, hence have great difficulty on transitive inference tasks, which require integration of two binary relations into a ternary relation. This theory attempts to integrate cognitive and developmental data on the basic of a single metric relational arity (number of related arguments). However, the lack of formal analysis into relational information involved in cognitive tasks threatens to undermine its utility. I propose using Natural language Information Analysis Method from relational database theory to analyze relational information in cognitive tasks. To demonstrate the utility of this method, I analyze two tasks: (1) simple oddity; and (2) dimension abstracted oddity. The analysis identifies the peak arity of simple oddity as binary and dimension abstracted oddity (like transitive inference) as ternary. Therefore, the relational theory predicts that dimension abstracted oddity cannot be performed until the median age of five years, while simple oddity can be performed earlier. The analysis also suggests variations on these tasks, and the peak arity for each variation is examined. 1

Reference-contexts: Removal of the redundant argument results in a ternary relation. So, for one task we have three different measurements of complexity. Relational complexity is well-defined in the relational database literature as the minimum arity that a relation can be reduced to without loss of information <ref> (Codd, 1990) </ref>. Furthermore, analysis methods such as NIAM (Halpin, 1995) can be used to formally analyze existing information systems into a minimum set of minimal arity relations (called optimal normal form) sufficient for representing and processing relational information in some domain.

The theory has also been applied to language comprehension, and planning tasks, such as the Towers of Hanoi (Halford et al., submitted). The essential point of the theory is that relational arity is an important factor in the ability of subjects to perform cognitive tasks. <p> The question as to whether young children can perform transitive inferences has been the subject of some dispute <ref> (see Halford, 1993, for a review) </ref>. Recently, apparent demonstrations of transitive inference in 3- and 4-year-olds by Goswami (1995) have challenged the claim that transitive inference cannot be performed before the median age of five. Although, the generality of these results was subsequently questioned by Halford et al. (submitted).

Reference-contexts: Halford's theory identifies relational arity as a metric for complexity in cognitive tasks. One technique from relational database theory called Natural language Information Analysis Method, NIAM <ref> (Halpin, 1995) </ref> is used to decompose information systems into an essential collection of connected relations. If one treats cognitive behavior as a relational information system, then cognitive tasks can be analyzed using NIAM into an essential collection of 2 relations. <p> So, for one task we have three different measurements of complexity. Relational complexity is well-defined in the relational database literature as the minimum arity that a relation can be reduced to without loss of information (Codd, 1990). Furthermore, analysis methods such as NIAM <ref> (Halpin, 1995) </ref> can be used to formally analyze existing information systems into a minimum set of minimal arity relations (called optimal normal form) sufficient for representing and processing relational information in some domain.

Reference-contexts: Even for object categorization, what adults would regard as two separate dimensions of similarity (e.g., colour and size), young children below the age of five integrate into a single dimension from which they determine relative 13 "sameness" <ref> (Smith, 1989) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The appeal of the relational theory is that it integrates a range of cognitive behaviour on the basis of a single metric relational order (arity), which is closely related to the number of interacting variables in an experimental design <ref> (Sweller, 1993) </ref>. Yet its weakness is that in the psychological literature, the concepts of relation and relational order have a wide interpretation one person's quaternary relation may be another person's ternary relation.
