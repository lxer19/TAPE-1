Title: Finite Differences vs Automatic Differentiation for Restartable Iterative Procedures CRPC-TR97733  
Author: Alan Carle Mike Fagan 
Date: December 4,1997  
Abstract: Many scientific programs that use iterative processes to compute their results also include a restart capability. This report investigates some methods that use restarts to improve the performance of sensitivity calculations. The investigation covers both finite-difference sensitivity methods as well as forward-mode automatic differentiation.

Reference-contexts: Assumptions on the iterative step function s Following Christianson <ref> [1] </ref> and Griewank et al [3] 1 , we assume that the iterative step function s has certain reasonable convergence properties. First, we assume that for any given G, s has a fixed point. <p> Using G b , restart q f , and the canonical derivative starting point q 0 0 , run the augmented s until the derivatives are converged to the desired accuracy. Previous work by Christianson <ref> [1] </ref>, Gilbert, and Griewank [3] has shown that the conditions we placed on s ensure Q-linear convergence of the function iteration, and R-linear convergence of the derivative iteration. In other words, the derivative iterates converge "at roughly the same rate" as the function iterates.

Reference-contexts: Then Estimate 2 still indicates fl fl q 0 fl fl q 0 Hence, starting at q 0 0 will still require about the same number of steps to converge derivatives as protocol 3. Experimental confirmation of this behavior for a computational fluid dynamics code is reported by Green <ref> [2] </ref>. 5 Conclusions Our main conclusion is that restart capability enables potential improvement in both finite difference and automatic differentiation sensitivity calculations. As always, for finite differences, the step size is important. It interacts inversely with the desired tolerance.
