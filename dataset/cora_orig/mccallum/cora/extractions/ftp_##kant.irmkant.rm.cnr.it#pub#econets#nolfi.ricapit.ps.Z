Abstract: The order in which anatomical characteristics develop in an individual from conception to maturity (ontogeny) may repeat the evolutionary history of the individual's species (phylogeny). Phylogenetically older characteristics often develop earlier during ontogeny and more recent phylogenetic characteristics develop later. We show evidence of phylogenetic recapitulation in the development of the nervous system of simple artificial organisms which are evolved using a genetic algorithm technique. In our simulations we found evidence of both acceleration and retardation in the ontogeny of characters acquired during phylogeny. The prevalence of accelerations with respect to retardations explains why characters are usually anticipated during ontogeny and, therefore, why ontogeny may recapitulate philogeny. Such acceleration and retardation phenomena appear to affect only functional characters, i.e. characters that play a role in determining the fitness of individuals.
