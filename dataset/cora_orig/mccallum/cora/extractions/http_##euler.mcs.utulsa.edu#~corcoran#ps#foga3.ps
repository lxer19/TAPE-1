Reference-contexts: Approximation methods for the bin packing problem have been shown to have impressive performance bounds. Garey and Johnson [7] and Johnson et al. [10] show bounds for the one dimensional problem to be as good as 1.2 times optimal. Coffman et al. <ref> [1] </ref> show bounds for the two dimensional problem to be as good as 1.7 times optimal using a simple technique, and 1.5 times optimal for a more complex method. 4 Li and Cheng [13] present a complex heuristic for the three dimensional problem with bounds of 3.25 times optimal.

Reference-contexts: Genetic algorithms have been used to obtain improvements over the approximation methods. Smith [14] used a GA on a two dimensional problem using a bottom left packing strategy. Corcoran and Wainwright [4] used a GA on a two dimensional problem using a level oriented strategy. Corcoran and Wainwright <ref> [2] </ref> also applied a GA to a three dimensional problem. However, as Corcoran and Wainwright [4] report, the GA fails to find the optimal on a contrived two dimensional problem with as few as 75 packages.

This data set is composed of 75 two-dimensional packages which can be optimally packed in a single open-ended bin using a level-oriented packing strategy. The optimal packing height for this data set is 60.

Reference-contexts: Chromosome reduction is a member of a class of heuristic techniques described by Corcoran and Wainwright <ref> [5] </ref>. The goal of each of these techniques is to identify sequences of genes in the chromosome which correspond to beneficial schemata and preserve these sequences through recombination. Chromosome reduction uses a sliding window to identify the sequences and reduction to preserve the sequences through recombination. <p> Chromosome reduction uses a sliding window to identify the sequences and reduction to preserve the sequences through recombination.

Only 32 solutions or 4% require 5 bins. <p> Table 1 clearly shows how chromosome reduction remains effective as the problem size is increased. Each of the data sets has the same pattern of cost distribution behavior as the original 6 package data set.

Reference-contexts: is there a partition of U into disjoint sets U 1 ; U 2 ; :::; U K such that the sum of the sizes of the items in each U i is B or less? The bin packing problem has been shown to be NP-complete in the strong sense <ref> [6] </ref>. Consequently, approximation methods have been developed which provide near-optimal solutions. The three best known approximation methods for the bin packing problem are Next Fit, First Fit, and Best Fit.
