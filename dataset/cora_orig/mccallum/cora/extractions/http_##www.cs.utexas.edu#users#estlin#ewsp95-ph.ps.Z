Abstract: In this paper we describe a number of obstacles hampering the application of planning technology to real-world problems, as encountered in two real-world planning projects at JPL: MVP a planning system for automated generation of image processing procedures; and LMCOA an intelligent system for assistance in antenna operations. First, we describe how existing planning representation must be enhanced to represent and reason about aspects of plans besides goal achievement resource usage, quality, execution time, flexibility, and generality. Second, planning systems must be able to fit into a wide range of operational contexts most planning tasks cannot be completely automated, therefore at a minimum the plans produced must be easily understandable and modifiable by the users. In some cases the user must be intimately involved in the plan construction process itself. Third, planning systems must be able to compare favorably in terms of software lifecycle costs to other means of automation such as scripts or rule-based expert systems. This means that development of intelligent tools and environments to facilitate knowledge acquisition, validation, and maintenance are of prime importance. We hope that our description and elucidation of these issues will lead to increased work in these areas.

A TDN authoring tool is being developed to automate the specification of TDNs. Developers as well as operations personnel will be able to graphically specify the TDN and its contents. TDNs can be composed from parts of existing TDNs and libraries of actions at the least.

Unfortunately, this current mode of operations is extremely labor and knowledge intensive. This task is labor intensive in that constructing the image processing procedures is a complex, tedious process which can take up to several months of effort.

Reference-contexts: Besides using these models in the planner, the simulator also permits us to test the LMCOA's ability to cope with the operational context issues described in the previous section. REBUS, which stands for Requirements Envisioning By Utilizing Scenarios, <ref> [Zorman 1995] </ref> is used to capture knowledge about the domain by using different scenarios to provide contextual information needed for planning. This provides us a way to understand how the subsystems controlled by the LMCOA actually work and how to control them under both normal and anomalous conditions.
