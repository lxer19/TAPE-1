Reference-contexts: This correlation might seem low but in fact it severely limits the information that can be obtained by averaging over many neurons <ref> (Britten et al. 1992) </ref>. A thousand correlated neurons carry little more information than 24 around 50 neurons. A quantitative application of our model to the cortex awaits measurements of the correlations in the relevant neural populations carrying information about disparity and vergence.

Reference-contexts: Recent results suggest that the parietal cortex might 22 also encode distance in a similar way. Gnadt has shown that many neurons in LIP respond to accommodation, disconjugate eye movements <ref> (Gnadt and Mays 1991) </ref> and disparity. Among those neurons tuned to disparity, some are modulated by the distance to fixation in a manner similar to that found in area V1 (Gnadt and Mays 1991). <p> Gnadt has shown that many neurons in LIP respond to accommodation, disconjugate eye movements <ref> (Gnadt and Mays 1991) </ref> and disparity. Among those neurons tuned to disparity, some are modulated by the distance to fixation in a manner similar to that found in area V1 (Gnadt and Mays 1991). This finding is consistent with our model and strongly supports the hypothesis that the parietal cortex represents egocentric distance as part of a spatial representation.

Reference-contexts: In cats, LeVay and Voigt recorded neurons which had peaks of disparity tuning that were distributed within this interval <ref> (LeVay and Voigt 1988) </ref>. Most recordings from monkeys have been from neurons in the foveal representation of primary visual cortex, [1 o ,1 o ]. <p> We assume that the number of cells with a given selectivity for horizontal disparity is a gaussian function of the peak of the tuning curve, centered at zero disparity <ref> (LeVay and Voigt 1988) </ref>: N i = N 0 e ffi 2 2ff 2 (12) Where N i is the number of cells in the pool with preferred disparity ffi i , N 0 is the number of cells in the pool with a preferred disparity of zero, and ff 2 <p> Sensitivity to distribution of neurons per disparity pool Changing the values of N 0 and ff 2 affects the quantitative predictions but not the conclusions. Fitting a gaussian to the data in LeVay et al. <ref> (LeVay and Voigt 1988) </ref> for anesthetized cats leads to a values of ff 2 = 2.0. Recordings from behaving monkeys rarely extend beyond the disparity range [1 o ,1 o ], but the value obtained for ff 2 in the cat probably provides an upper bound.

Reference-contexts: It describes only how spike rates vary around their mean value while ignoring variations in interspike intervals. These variations would have been relevant if we had considered neural codes involving the temporal distribution of the spike train. Evidence for such code in the cortex exists <ref> (McClurkin et al. 1991) </ref>, but are still tentative. Consequently, we assumed that the idealized neurons in our model encode information through their mean firing rates.

Reference-contexts: Whether the brain makes use of basis functions is not yet clear from physiological data, but the problem of spatial localization may be one area where 8 it can be tested <ref> (Poggio 1990) </ref>. We show in this section that the observed cor-tical representation of distance can be considered a new type of basis function that combines some of the best features of radial basis functions and sigmoids.

Reference-contexts: The limited size of the receptive fields of V1 neurons might seem a serious problem, but a recent hierarchical model demonstrates that a retino-spatiotopic representation of spatial location is feasible <ref> (Pouget et al. 1993) </ref>. By retino-spatiotopic we simply mean that cells encode the spatial location of an object falling on a limited region of the retina, just as many cells code orientation or color. <p> Such egocentric representations would be useful reference frames for planning actions. physiological and psychophysical experiments claiming the contrary <ref> (Pouget et al. 1993) </ref>. Lesion experiments in area V1 cannot be used as a guide since such lesions typically result in blindness, a non-specific impairment which would certainly mask other more specific disorders.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, human cannot possibly perceive the actual distance of an object for all possible pairs of vergence and disparity. The perceived distance function can be obtained by replacing the disparity, d, with the perceived disparity, dperc, in Eq. 1. The perceived disparity was obtained by parameterizing the psychometric curves <ref> (Richards 1971) </ref> (Fig. 7, A-B): ffi 0 = 1:8ffie j1:5ffij 0:9 ffi perc = ffi 0 otherwise (9) Figures 8A and 9A show respectively geometrical distance and perceived distance as a function of disparity and vergence. <p> This would not affect our previous results since both sets of functions can approximate this new distance function by simply multiplying the distance function by a constant (the gain). A more serious problem arises from nonlinearities in the psychometric curve of perceived disparity as a function of geometric disparity <ref> (Richards 1971) </ref> (Fig. 7A). The perception of disparity appears to be accurate within the range of [-40', 40'] but reverses and returns to zero as the disparity increases. As a consequence, a stimulus with 4 degrees of disparity is perceived at nearly the plane of fixation. <p> If all the 18 A) Experimental data from <ref> (Richards 1971) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: more versatile and easier to train. 3.6 Extraretinal vs retinal cues for viewing distance Vertical disparity could also be used to recover viewing distance (Longuet-Higgins 1982; Mayhew and Longuet-Higgins 1982) and recent evidence from humans show conditions under which it can be used for absolute distance judgments and disparity scaling <ref> (Rogers and Bradshaw 1993) </ref>. However, vertical disparity is not used by the visual system for objects smaller than 20 o of visual angle (Cumming et al. 1991; Rogers and Bradshaw 1993), probably because the vertical disparity of smaller objects is too small for the visual system to detect.

Reference-contexts: One way to determine an appropriate set of hidden units is to use an optimization procedure such as backpropagation <ref> (Rumelhart et al. 1986) </ref>. An alternative is to handcraft a good set of hidden units, such as a set of basis functions.

Reference-contexts: Estimators with smaller bias have a higher variance and low variance estimators have greater bias. There is a compromise is choosing an estimator between minimizing the bias and reducing the variance <ref> (Scott 1992) </ref>. Estimating distance from the responses of noisy neurons is subject to this bias-variance trade-off. The bias corresponds to the difference between the estimated and the true geometrical distance. Recovery of the true geometrical distance without bias leads to a high variance.

Reference-contexts: The magnitudes of the responses to disparity were modulated by the distance to fixation but the shape and position of the peaks of the tuning curves were unchanged. Figure 4 shows four examples of these neurons <ref> (Trotter et al. 1992) </ref>. Since the position of the peak of the disparity selectivity is invariant with changes in viewing distance, these neurons were not tuned to distance, but neither were they unambiguously tuned to disparity. <p> In all cases, only the amplitude of the response varies with fixation distance while the general shape of the disparity tuning curve and the position of response peak remain the same. These neurons are neither pure disparity nor pure distance detectors (see Fig. 3).

Reference-contexts: Measurements of K vary from 1 to 3 and b is usually close to 1. We used K = 2 and b=1 for most of our analysis, which are the average values for these parameters reported in awake animals <ref> (Vogels et al. 1989) </ref>. Our results were not sensitive to the exact values of these constants. It is essential for our analysis only that 2 be proportional to the activity.

Reference-contexts: By retino-spatiotopic we simply mean that cells encode the spatial location of an object falling on a limited region of the retina, just as many cells code orientation or color. Further evidence for retino-spatiotopic maps was found in area 17 in cats <ref> (Weyand and Malpeli 1989) </ref> and area V3A in monkeys (Galleti and Battaglini 1989), where the visual response amplitudes of neurons are modulated by the vertical and horizontal eye position.

Reference-contexts: Because the second layer of the network is effectively a linear transformation, the delta rule is not subject to local minima and the weights are guaranteed to converge to the optimal network <ref> (Widrow and Stearns 1985) </ref>. 1.3 Results Geometrical distance 13 gain-modulated units. C) Approximation by a set of distance-tuned units. We first determined the set of weights that provided the best approximation to geometrical distance as a function of vergence and disparity using gain-modulated units as a basis set. <p> The delta rule is guaranteed to converge to the minimum of the error after a sufficient number of presentations of the training set if a is sufficiently small <ref> (Widrow and Stearns 1985) </ref>. Estimating geometrical and perceived disparity In the presence of noise, it is more convenient to treat the output of the network and the activity of the neuronal pools as random variables. Let Y* be a random variable corresponding to the target disparities (either perceived or geometrical).

Reference-contexts: The optimal set of weights were determined for all four combinations of the two input representations and the two output functions. The delta rule <ref> (Widrow and Hoff 1960) </ref>, an iterative optimization technique, was used to find the optimal set of weights for the network shown in figure 5 (see appendix).

Reference-contexts: The distributed representation of depth in this study is similar to the way that position is represented in head-centered space along the vertical and horizontal axes <ref> (Zipser and Andersen 1988) </ref>. Tuning for disparity is eye-centered and the responses are modulated by eye position, though not by conjugate eye movements as in previous models but by vergence eye movements.
