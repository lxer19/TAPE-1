Title: Local Allocation of End-to-End Quality-of-Service in High-Speed Networks 1  
Author: Ramesh Nagarajan Jim Kurose and Don Towsley 
Keyword: Quality-of-Service; High-Speed Networks; Resource Allocation  
Abstract: Quality-of-service (QOS) requirements for applications in high-speed networks are typically specified on an end-to-end basis. Mapping this end-to-end requirement to nodal requirements facilitates providing QOS guarantees and simplifies connection admission. In this paper, we evaluate strategies for such local allocation of the end-to-end QOS. A QOS allocation policy is said to perform better than another when the maximum network load that it can support is greater. A major contribution of this work is the development of a nodal metric that predicts the relative performance of QOS allocation policies in a network setting. Computation of the nodal metric and direct evaluation of allocation policy performance for two simple network models yield valuable insight into the choice of allocation policies. Intuitively, one expects significant differences in the performance of allocation policies when there are significant imbalances in nodal resource capacities or traffic loads. It is found, however, that with the packet loss probability as the QOS metric, there is little difference in the performance of allocation policies in the regime of applications with low loss requirements. From a practical viewpoint, this suggests that a simple allocation policy may be adopted in this scenario with only a small decrease in carried load with respect to an optimal policy. For applications which tolerate large packet loss or alternate QOS metrics, however, QOS allocation policies differ significantly in their performance. Our results indicate that the development of "optimal" QOS allocation policies is of interest in such cases.

Reference-contexts: QOS requirements for applications are, however, often specified on an end-to-end basis. In order that any of these techniques be applicable, this end-to-end requirement must therefore be mapped to nodal QOS requirements. We next consider the issue of end-to-end QOS guarantees. Cruz <ref> [Cru91] </ref> outlines the computation of worst-case end-to-end delay bounds for sessions in arbitrary networks. Kurose [Kur92] outlines the computation of nodal performance bounds (on distributions of pertinent quantities such as packet delay) on a per-session basis when the session traffic is stochastically bounded over intervals of time. <p> This bounding technique also permits one to compute point-valued worst-case delay bounds. Golestani [Gol90] also provides an worst-case end-to-end delay bound for sessions provided a special stop-and-go service discipline is adopted at the network nodes. A straightforward application of the proposed techniques <ref> [Kur92, Cru91] </ref> in a connection admission algorithm will require the algorithm to compute, at connection setup times, the end-to-end delay bounds for all affected sessions on the new session's route in order to ensure that no QOS guarantees for existing sessions are violated upon admitting the new connection. <p> The details of such a scheme remain a topic for further investigation. Other areas for future research include considering alternate source models such as the (; ) characterization of Cruz <ref> [Cru91] </ref>. Finally, similar techniques (in particular the RGR) may be applied to a slightly different allocation problem discussed in [SR + 90] that considers the local allocation of an end-to-end deadline for real-time applications. 26

Reference-contexts: This can be cumbersome and time-consuming at best. The problem might be alleviated by apportioning the end-to-end guarantee locally for each connection and then simply verifying that the local guarantee, rather than the end-to-end guarantee, is still satisfied. The research efforts of <ref> [FV90, VHN92] </ref> adopt this approach. In all of these approaches, a "best" possible guarantee is computed at each of the nodes for the new session while satisfying local guarantees for existing sessions. <p> The local guarantees are then aggregated and the "excess" over the required QOS value for the new session is reassigned among the nodes. However, neither of <ref> [FV90, VHN92] </ref> address in detail the assignment of the excess end-to-end QOS to nodes. In [FV90], for example, the excess value is simply equally distributed among the nodes along the source-destination path. <p> The local guarantees are then aggregated and the "excess" over the required QOS value for the new session is reassigned among the nodes.

In <ref> [FV90] </ref>, for example, the excess value is simply equally distributed among the nodes along the source-destination path. Thus the important and interesting problem of apportioning the end-to-end QOS values to local nodes has been largely ignored in recent research efforts.

Reference-contexts: The assumption may be justified on the basis of the fact that the small packet delays in future high-speed networks and projected network operation under conditions of low loss will result in near preservation of connection traffic characteristics as it proceeds through the network [O + 91] (see also Kelly <ref> [Kel91, pp. 12] </ref>). We first consider an equal QOS allocation policy (EQ) which assigns an equal amount of the end-to-end QOS for a connection to each node, i.e., q i = q j = q 8i; j.

The following are two noteworthy features of the computed upper bound: * The upper bound values are relatively small, i.e., the relative gain in traffic load for any QOS allocation policy over the EQ policy, even in the worst of scenarios (for the EQ policy), is relatively small. <p> Also, an imbalance in buffer capacities appears less detrimental to the performance of the EQ policy than an imbalance in bandwidths at the nodes of the network. Last, we observed in <ref> [NKT92] </ref> that the OPT policy does somewhat better than the EQ policy when the bottleneck node is closer to the head of the tandem queue than when it is closer to the tail. <p> The problem of multiple QOS classes is, hence, not very interesting in the context of our nodal model (where we assume FCFS service). For the metrics of interest in this paper, the optimal solution for the above problem is (see <ref> [NKT92] </ref>) N opt = Min (N 1 ; N 2 ); (30) where N 1 = fN : 1 ( ) = Q 1 g and N 2 = fN : 2 ( ) = Q 2 g. 6.1 Allocating the loss QOS metric: Results We consider in turn the source <p> The surprising result in Figure 15 is that the OPT policy performs better than the EQ policy more when there is equal loading on the two paths than when there is uneven loading on the two paths. A detailed explanation is provided in <ref> [NKT92] </ref>. The essence of the argument is that the nodal load imbalances on the "bottleneck" path, when the path load imbalances are large, are small and vice-versa. Since nodal resources are identical, the OPT and EQ policies perform similarly when path load imbalances are large. <p> The computation of the RGR for the average delay QOS metric and the M1 source model and the performance of the EQ and OPT allocation policies for the network models of Section 5 and 6 is outlined in <ref> [NKT92] </ref>. We present only a sample computation here. Consider the tandem network model of Section 5 with five hops, i.e., h = 5. Let the link bandwidths at the nodes be 1000; 1100; 1200; 1300 and 1400 units and s = 1 unit respectively.

Reference-contexts: Hence, we have the M=M=1=K queueing model for the node and the packet loss probability is: q = G () = (1 ) K =(1 K+1 ): (6) where, as usual, = N s =, is the traffic intensity.

Reference-contexts: The assumption may be justified on the basis of the fact that the small packet delays in future high-speed networks and projected network operation under conditions of low loss will result in near preservation of connection traffic characteristics as it proceeds through the network <ref> [O + 91] </ref> (see also Kelly [Kel91, pp. 12]). We first consider an equal QOS allocation policy (EQ) which assigns an equal amount of the end-to-end QOS for a connection to each node, i.e., q i = q j = q 8i; j.

Reference-contexts: We also assume, as noted earlier, that a M1 source remains a M1 source in the interior of the network. However, we thin the M1 source in accordance with the losses suffered at the respective nodes as it proceeds through the network <ref> [SR + 90] </ref>. This thinning is not possible for the M2 source in any reasonable fashion, i.e., without altering the source model itself, and hence the M2 source will retain its exact characteristics as it proceeds through the network. <p> The details of such a scheme remain a topic for further investigation. Other areas for future research include considering alternate source models such as the (; ) characterization of Cruz [Cru91]. Finally, similar techniques (in particular the RGR) may be applied to a slightly different allocation problem discussed in <ref> [SR + 90] </ref> that considers the local allocation of an end-to-end deadline for real-time applications. 26

Reference-contexts: We will refer to this source traffic model as M1 and denote its average rate by s . The second model considers each source as a packet voice source. This standard model has as its basic premise (see, e.g., <ref> [DL86, HL86, SW86, NKT91] </ref>) that an active voice source periodically generates fixed length packets when a speaker is speaking (talkspurt) and otherwise remains idle. We briefly describe this model here; the reader is referred to the above references, in particular [SW86], for additional details and discussion. <p> We briefly describe this model here; the reader is referred to the above references, in particular <ref> [SW86] </ref>, for additional details and discussion. The voice packetization period is assumed to be fixed at 16 msec: and the talkspurt is assumed to contain a geometrically distributed number of packets, with mean 22 packets. The mean length of a talkspurt is thus 1 = 352 msec. <p> Given the above model, the interarrival times between packets generated by a single source form a renewal process. With probability 1=22; the interarrival time is 16 msec: and with probability 21=22; the interarrival time is 16 + X msec. <ref> [SW86] </ref>. We will refer to this source model as M2. In this paper, we find an alternate fluid description of the M2 source more amenable to analysis. It is assumed that the source, when active, transmits information at an uniform rate rather than as discrete packets. <p> The analysis of the voice sources multiplexer is rather complex <ref> [NKT91, B + 91, HL86, SW86, AMS82] </ref>, only approximate numerical techniques are available and, in general, no closed-form expression G () is available for this realistic scenario. <p> may then be computed as (q; C) = dq=q 2dx=x = x dq 5 The authors [G + 91, GG92] consider the buffer overflow probability and not the packet loss probability but it is believed that the two quantities might be close for the system in consideration [Mit] (see also <ref> [SW86] </ref>) 8 where dx = ( 2mqff 0 )(1 + 0 q 0 ): (14) Simplifying, one obtains (q; C) = q 0 : (15) Figures 3 shows the RGR for this model as a function of the link capacity and the QOS requirement It can be seen that the values

Reference-contexts: This can be cumbersome and time-consuming at best. The problem might be alleviated by apportioning the end-to-end guarantee locally for each connection and then simply verifying that the local guarantee, rather than the end-to-end guarantee, is still satisfied. The research efforts of <ref> [FV90, VHN92] </ref> adopt this approach. In all of these approaches, a "best" possible guarantee is computed at each of the nodes for the new session while satisfying local guarantees for existing sessions. <p> The local guarantees are then aggregated and the "excess" over the required QOS value for the new session is reassigned among the nodes. However, neither of <ref> [FV90, VHN92] </ref> address in detail the assignment of the excess end-to-end QOS to nodes. In [FV90], for example, the excess value is simply equally distributed among the nodes along the source-destination path.

Reference-contexts: Nagarajan and Kurose [NK92] consider the issue of appropriate QOS metrics for applications in high-speed networks and approaches to guaranteeing these metrics at the nodal level . Woodruff and Kositpaiboon <ref> [WK90] </ref> demonstrate via simulation how nodal QOS measures can be satisfied. All of the aforementioned research efforts assume that a nodal QOS requirement is specified. QOS requirements for applications are, however, often specified on an end-to-end basis.

Reference-contexts: Thus the important and interesting problem of apportioning the end-to-end QOS values to local nodes has been largely ignored in recent research efforts. This issue of the allocation of the end-to-end QOS is the primary focus of this paper. In <ref> [WN91] </ref>, we addressed this issue of QOS allocation under the assumption that nodal QOS guarantees are provided by explicitly allocating resources to each connection at each node. In this paper, we consider a more realistic scenario in which nodal resources are shared among connections.

Reference-contexts: While we argued that this might be reasonable for future gigabit networks, it is of interest to evaluate the effects of this assumption on the conclusions of this paper in a "non-asymptotic" low-speed regime (preliminary work <ref> [Y + ] </ref> appears to indicate that the approximation holds, reasonably, in this scenario as well). In this context, it is useful to view the network nodes as having different characterizations, G (), for their performance. Hence, these nodes might have non-identical RGRs for identical parameter values.
