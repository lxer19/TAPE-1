Abstract: We prove there is no polynomial deterministic space simulation for two-way random-tape probabilistic space (Pr 2 SPACE) (as defined in [BCP 83]) for all functions f : IN ! IN and all ff 2 IN; Pr 2 SPACE(f(n)) 6 DSPACE(f(n) ff ). This is answer to the problem formulated in op cit., whether the deterministic squared-space simulation (for recognizers and transducers) generalizes to the two-way random-tape machine model. We prove, in fact, a stronger result saying that even space-bounded Las Vegas two-way random-tape algorithms (yielding always the correct answer and terminating with probability 1) are exponentially more efficient than the deterministic ones.

Reference-contexts: The number of configurations accessible on input x is bounded by jxj 2 kfjxj . M is simulated by a 1 -machine T (i.e. with one-way random- tape) in the same way as a two-way finite automaton is simulated by a one-way FA (see <ref> [HU 79] </ref>). It holds a table which says for each pair of configurations: if M is in configuration c and goes left (on the random tape) then it can (or cannot) come back in configuration c 0 .
