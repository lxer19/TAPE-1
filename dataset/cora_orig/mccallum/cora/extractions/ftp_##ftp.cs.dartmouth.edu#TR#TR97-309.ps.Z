Abstract: 1 Dartmouth College Computer Science Technical Report Abstract Creation of large and complex World Wide Web sites is hampered by the page at a time approach of many tools and the programming knowledge and custom software development required for automated solutions. This report describes the development of the Automatic Site Markup Language (ASML). ASML is a new markup language designed to produce large, complicated web sites which can include dynamic content. ASML extends HTML with new, high-level features while still preserving complete compatibility with common browser and server technologies. It has powerful indexing and searching facilities, and enables the automatic translation of document formats. Most importantly, ASML provides HTML-like features at the site level rather than just the page level.

Reference-contexts: This page at a time approach views a site as a collection of discrete hypertext documents. DEVLAB experiences with web site development projects, such as the DAGS95 Conference Proceedings [8], The Olympics in the Ancient Hellenic World <ref> [1] </ref>, and The Prehistoric Archaeology of the Aegean [ 32] have clearly exhibited the shortcomings of the page-at-a-time approach. Rice, et. al. discuss similar experiences creating large WWW sites, wherein they state that trying to correct many of our early errors has become an extremely time-intensive job [28]. <p> The Olympics in the Ancient Hellenic World site was created using scripts based on m4, a macro language common in Unix systems, and Perl scripts for dynamic content generation <ref> [1] </ref>. Many other projects in the DEVLAB have been done using the Perl language entirely. These projects assumed a knowledgeable programmer with experience in programming with the Perl language and the need for custom software development for every single project.

Reference-contexts: As in most of the larger commercial systems, Web Project Explorer has site level organization and visualization tools, but retains a page-at-a-time editing and composition approach. Bacher and Ottmann promote the idea of authoring on the fly <ref> [2] </ref>. In this paradigm a class lecture presentation is recorded and automatically translated to a complete Hyper-G presentation. This is an example of a highly application specific approach to site level authoring.

Reference-contexts: W3DT WebDesigner implements a site level structure including templates defining common page components and automatic generation of site organization <ref> [ 3] </ref>. However, WebDesigner generates page templates which must then be edited to include content. Later changes to the template structure are not supported. None of these systems support automatic re-targeting of identical content in multiple formats.

Reference-contexts: There are many application areas where site-level authoring and the ability to evolve format are very important. One example is online museums [18]. Such sites can involve huge amounts of material. A page-at-a-time authoring approach would be cumbersome and later revision (remodeling) time consuming. Another application area is education <ref> [4] </ref>. Many educators wish to place class notes and other materials on the WWW as a dissemination mechanism, leading to a large number of education specific approaches to site-level authoring and automatic content generation.

Reference-contexts: ASML can be compared to HTML conversion utilities (though it has many more features). An example is authoring in Latex, a common document preparation system, then converting the Latex to HTML using the Latex2HTML tool [10,16]. InterBook allows for editing in Microsoft Word and conversion to HTML <ref> [ 5] </ref>. Hidden text is used to provide annotation capabilities which InterBook can understand and utilize in the translation process (for links, annotations, etc.). Such tools are not optimized for HTML authoring. They are primarily designed to facilitate conversion of existing content.

There are many approaches to the creation of resources for the World Wide Web. Documents are electronically served in many forms including raw text, hypertext markup language (HTML), graphic images, and executable programs.

Reference-contexts: Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) is a system for defining markup languages <ref> [14] </ref>. HTML is an SGML-compliant markup language in that it can be described using an SGML document type descriptor (DTD). ASML incorporates many features such as repeated expansion, tags inside tags, and conditional expansion which are beyond the structure of SGML. Hence, ASML is not SGML-compliant.

ASML provides higher-level features while retaining a common distribution format. The markup format used in ASML was a difficult decision. Many alternatives were examined including the &lt;@tag&gt; structure used in ATML <ref> [ 15] </ref>. However, it was felt that that format would be difficult to distinguish from HTML and would be confusing for novice page authors. The use of braces is not ideal in that it conflicts with the format proposed for cascading style sheets [31].

Figure 6 and Figure 7 illustrate several pages from this site. This project and ASML development proceeded concurrently and the design of this site was a major influence on the design of ASML. It also provided a large amount of user testing. <p> When ASML was under development the cascading style sheet proposal had been considered dropped. It has only recently been revived.

The ASML markup format also conflicts with JavaScript [ 22]. Most of the same issues apply in that case. 6. Templates in ASML A fundamental design element of ASML is the template. A template is text, possibility with optional fill-in content, which is accessed using an ASML tag. <p> This allows for creation of multiple pages based on some common template. As an example, the Prehistoric Archaeology of the Aegean site uses a -foreach-loop to generate the 29 lessons, filling in the titles, next and previous lesson information, and text for each <ref> [32] </ref>. The -/foreach- end tag is required. All content between -foreach- and -/foreach- is considered to be a loop body. Nested loops are fully supported in ASML, a loop body can contain another loop. The foreach- tag attributes are: counter, from, to, and by.
