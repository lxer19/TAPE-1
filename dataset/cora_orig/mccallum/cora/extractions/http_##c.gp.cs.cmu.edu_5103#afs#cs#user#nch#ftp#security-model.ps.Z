Title: A Model for Secure Protocols and Their Compositions (extended abstract)

Abstract: We give a formal model of protocol security. Our model allows us to reason about the security of protocols, and considers issues of beliefs of agents, time, and secrecy. We prove a composition theorem which allows us to state sufficient conditions on two secure protocols A and B such that they may be combined to form a new secure protocol C. Moreover, we give counter-examples to show that when the conditions are not met, the protocol C may not be secure.

Reference-contexts: it can be shown that the extra structure afforded by simultaneous events is inconsequential for the security properties identified in this paper, and so, for simplicity, we shall use total orders. (This bears a superficial resemblance to the treatment of time in the model theory of temporal logic [3], [7], <ref> [1] </ref>.) We remark that an agent typically sends a message to some designated recipient (such information may be implicit in a protocol, or explicit in the plaintext or encrypted parts of messages).

Reference-contexts: In contrast, previous undecidability results for protocol security have been based on complex algebraic properties of much richer encryption systems. For example the proof of undecidability for half-word ping-pong protocols <ref> [10] </ref> relies critically on the structure of a more general encryption-decryption scheme that allows commutativity of some pairs of operators. 20 VII. Composition of Protocols Consider the problem of combining protocols.

Reference-contexts: The key property of this subclass of models is that if the protocol is secure in this subclass, then it is secure in all models.

Reference-contexts: Two secret-secure protocols whose composition is not secret-secure. the essence of what it means for a protocol to be secure. In an earlier report <ref> [14] </ref>, we provided evidence for this assertion by comparing three models with different notions of time: one was an early version of the model presented in this paper, and the other two differed only in that they incorporated specific notions of time.

Reference-contexts: In an insecure networked environment, such an assumption is at best restrictive, and at worst unrealistic. Instead, we shall use a more abstract time that is compatible with systems of unsynchronized clocks, as well as non-standard notions of time such as Lamport clocks <ref> [16] </ref>. This is based on a very minimal assumption about time: each agent has a local notion of "before" and "after" that defines a total order on each agent's events.

Reference-contexts: Clearly there must be some consistent way of interleaving the message traces from the various agents such that each message receive is preceded by a message send (this is identical to a requirement used by Merritt <ref> [18] </ref>). Moreover, we require that this interleaving must be "fair".
