Abstract: What viewpoint control strategies are important for exploring the shape of unknown, curved objects? We argue that strategies that control viewpoint on the tangent plane of automatically-selected points projecting to the occluding contour can be very useful for local, global, qualitative, as well as quantitative shape recovery. This paper studies the design and implementation of an uncalibrated hand-eye system for tangential viewpoint control. We show that tangential viewpoint control can be accurately performed in real time using an uncalibrated camera to control a robot manipulator with at least three degrees of freedom. The only requirement is that at least four points can be identified on the robot's end-effector and can be tracked across frames.

Reference-contexts: Our previous work has shown that vision-guided viewpoint control allows the use of weaker camera calibration assumptions, simplifies shape computations, and enables exploration of complex curved objects. Example tasks we have studied include occluding contour detection <ref> [8] </ref>, local surface curvature estimation [9], affine-invariant surface reconstruction [10], as well as global model-building [11]. <p> The occluding contour becomes a rich source of visual information during the exploration of curved objects because its shape is highly constrained by the surface giving rise to it [17]. Furthermore, several approaches have been suggested for the detection of the occluding contour (e.g., <ref> [8, 18] </ref>). With the contour at the center of our approach, viewpoint control is formulated as an online, geometric planning process whose goal is to achieve a well-defined 3D affine relationship between the object, its occluding contour, the manipulator, and the camera. <p> By appropriately choosing these points we can detect the occluding contour <ref> [8] </ref> and recover affine representations of unknown curved objects without the need for extrinsic camera calibration or viewpoint motion measurements [10].

Factoring out the dependence of the occluding contour's shape on viewpoint: In general, when a surface point p is viewed from different viewpoints on its tangent plane, the local shape of the occluding contour (i.e., its curvature at p's projection) will be different.

Reference-contexts: In our framework, visual exploration of curved objects is performed using the occluding contour <ref> [17] </ref> both to con-trol viewpoint and to recover shape information. The occluding contour is the projection of the visible rim, the one-dimensional set of visible surface points at which the line of sight is tangent. <p> The occluding contour becomes a rich source of visual information during the exploration of curved objects because its shape is highly constrained by the surface giving rise to it <ref> [17] </ref>. Furthermore, several approaches have been suggested for the detection of the occluding contour (e.g., [8, 18]).

Reference-contexts: However, if we start changing viewpoint on p's tangent plane, p will remain on the visible rim for as long as it does not become occluded by points that are closer to the camera <ref> [21] </ref>. Consequently, even though in general the visible rim can be thought of as sliding over the surface when viewpoint changes continuously, we can force the visible rim to remain stationary at specific points by controlling viewpoint on their tangent plane.
