Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel way of model reduction based on matrix pencil theory. Using only orthogonal transformations on state space models, we construct an approximation to the smallest perturbation to the coefficients that yields a lower order system. We derive some bounds on the stability of the resulting lower order system. We illustrate our method with an example arising from large flexible space structures.

In Section 4 we present an algorithm for model reduction and make some remarks on how it can be modified to suit the particular needs of the designer. <p> In Section 6, we present a worked example. Finally, in Section 7, we make some concluding remarks. 2. Computation of Deficient Pencil In this section we discuss two issues of importance to the reduction scheme as they were espoused in <ref> [1] </ref>. The first one concerns the problem of determining whether a given rectangular pencil is deficient or not. Specifically, given an n x p pencil (A lB), with n &gt; p, determine whether or not (A lB) loses rank for any l, including possibly l infinite. <p> By augmenting A and B matrices with arbitrary n x (n p) matrices C, D. We can examine the square n x n generalized eigenvalue problem In <ref> [1] </ref> two choices were proposed for the selection of C and D. (2) [ A,C ] v l [B, D] v . One of these choices is to select C and D as orthonormal basis of the space orthogonal to the columns of A and B. <p> If we denote by s * and s * the minimum in (3) and value of s achieving that minimum, respectively, then E = s * . In <ref> [1] </ref>, it was shown that a simpler scheme which provides both a good estimate for E and for that value of s that yields the minimum in (3) involves solving the eigenvalue problem (2). <p> By taking norms of (4), the following bounds are obtained for the perturbations: E i E i (Cl i D)y i / x i . We also have the following error bound from <ref> [1] </ref>. If E denotes that perturbation with the smallest norm yielding a deficient pencil, then E := s * satisfies The importance of (5) was noted and stated as follows. (5) i i i i x i Proposition 1 [1]: Let (A lB) be an n x p pencil, with n <p> We also have the following error bound from <ref> [1] </ref>. If E denotes that perturbation with the smallest norm yielding a deficient pencil, then E := s * satisfies The importance of (5) was noted and stated as follows. (5) i i i i x i Proposition 1 [1]: Let (A lB) be an n x p pencil, with n &gt; p. Let C, D be two arbitrary full-rank n x (n p) matrices.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, consider a non-deficient n x p pencil (A lB). In this case, we know that B has full rank. We would like to estimate the size of the perturbation E to the matrix A that is needed to obtain a deficient pencil (A+ElB). In <ref> [2] </ref>, it was shown that the smallest perturbation E can be obtained by solving the minimization problem where s min (M) denotes the smallest singular value of the matrix (3)min s min (A sB) , M, and s varies over the entire complex plane.

Reference-contexts: One can then proceed with the model order reduction of the stable part. We shall also assume that the state space realization described by (1) is minimal. According to the PBH rank test (see e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>), the dynamical system described by (1) is controllable if and only if the matrix pencil [FlI G] = [F G] l [I 0], has full rank for any complex value l.

Reference-contexts: As a increases, the perturbation E 1 to F is no longer zero but varies continuously with a. Therefore stability of (F + E 1 ) is maintained for small values of a. Application of the Bauer-Fike theorem <ref> [6] </ref> gives us the following result. Let K be the condition number of the matrix of eigenvectors of F, and d the distance to the imaginary axis of the eigenvalue of F which is closest to the imaginary axis.

Reference-contexts: Then stability of (F + E 1 ) is guaranteed as long as K E 1 &lt; d. The reader is referred to <ref> [14] </ref> for details. In practice we found it just sufficed to verify the stability of the perturbed system. 5. Another issue of concern is that of the n p spurious eigenvalues introduced when the eigenvalue equation is solved. <p> However, when a 0, the value of E i for the spurious roots is finite; but generally, E i for the spurious eigenvalues will be much larger than for the non-spurious eigenvalues. Space does not permit an extensive discussion here, but the reader is referred to <ref> [14] </ref> for a detailed explanation. 5. Model Reduction Error In this section we derive expressions for the model ACC-1994 p. 3 reduction error. We consider two cases which are 1) a = 0, and 2) a 0.

When the perturbation matrix E i corresponds to a complex eigenvalue then the reduction scheme in <ref> [15] </ref> needs be modified so that the two states corresponding to a pair of complex eigenvalues are simultaneously truncated. <p> Also, for a large order system, it will be more economical to reduce the order of the system by multiple states instead of a single state each time the matrix pencil is perturbed. In this section, we show how to extend the method outlined in <ref> [15] </ref> to handle both situations. Specifically, suppose we want to truncate N modes from the full order model.
