Beltrami's proof of the existence of the singular decomposition shows that it is closely related to the spectral decompositions of A T A and AA T .

In his investigation of the geometry of n-space, Jordan [27, 1875] introduced canonical bases for pairs of subspaces.

Reference-contexts: Envoi With Weyl's contribution, the theory of the singular value decomposition can be said to have matured. The subsequent history is one of extensions, new discoveries, and applications. What follows is a brief sketch of these developments yet to come. Extensions. Autonne <ref> [2, 1913] </ref> extended the decomposition to complex matrices. Eckart and Young [12, 1936], [13, 1939] extended it to rectangular matrices and rediscovered Schmidt's approximation theorem, which is often (and incorrectly) called the Eckart-Young theorem.

Reference-contexts: Nomenclature. 7 The term "singular value" seems to have come from the literature on integral equations. A little after the appearance of Schmidt's paper, Bateman <ref> [4, 1908] </ref> refers to numbers that are essentially the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the kernel as singular values. Picard [37, 1910] notes that for symmetric kernels Schmidt's eigenvalues are real and in this case (but not in general) he calls them singular values.

Its present day popularity is due to Wielandt (see <ref> [14, p.113] </ref>) and Lanczos [32, 1958], who apparently rediscovered the decomposition independently. Yet another consequence of Jordan's approach is the variational characterization of the largest singular value as the maximum of a function.

Reference-contexts: Is is an intriguing observation that most of the classical matrix decompositions predated the widespread use of matrices: they were cast in terms of determinants, linear systems of equations, and especially bilinear and quadratic forms. Gauss is the father of this development. Writing in 1823 <ref> [15, x31] </ref>, he describes his famous 1 2 The Early History of the SVD elimination algorithm as follows.

Reference-contexts: Nomenclature. 7 The term "singular value" seems to have come from the literature on integral equations. A little after the appearance of Schmidt's paper, Bateman [4, 1908] refers to numbers that are essentially the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the kernel as singular values. Picard <ref> [37, 1910] </ref> notes that for symmetric kernels Schmidt's eigenvalues are real and in this case (but not in general) he calls them singular values. By 1937, Smithes was referring to singular values of an integral equation in our modern sense of the word.

Reference-contexts: Approximation Theorems. Schmidt's approximation theorem has been generalized in a number of directions. Mirsky [33, 1960] showed that A k of (5.2) is a minimizing matrix in any unitarily invariant norm. The case where further restrictions are imposed on the minimizing matrix are treated in <ref> [10, 17, 38] </ref>. Given matrices A and B, The Procrustes problem, which arises in the statistical method of factor analysis, is that of determining a unitary matrix Q such that kA BQk is minimized (for the name see [24, 1962]). <p> Green [20, 1952] and Schoneman [40, 1966] showed that if U T A T BV = is the singular value decomposition of A T B, then the minimizing matrix is Q = VU T . Rao <ref> [38, 1980] </ref> The Early History of the SVD 19 considers the more general problem of minimizing kPA BQk, where P and Q are orthogonal. Principal Components. An alternative to factor analysis is the principal component analysis of Hotelling [22, 1933].

Reference-contexts: The second has the flavor of some recent algorithms in which discrete transformations are replaced by continuous transformations defined by differential equations (for applications of this approach to the singular value decomposition see [7, 9]). But Sylvester does not give enough detail to write down such equations. 5. Schmidt <ref> [39, 1907] </ref> Our story now moves from the domain of linear algebra to integral equations, one of the hot topics of the first decades of our century.

Reference-contexts: Incidentally, the technique of deflation apparently lay fallow until Schur <ref> [41, 1917] </ref> used it to establish his triangular form of a general matrix. It is now a widely used theoretical and algorithmic tool. The matrix 0 A ! from which the determinant D was formed, is also widely used.

Reference-contexts: In his investigation of the geometry of n-space, Jordan [27, 1875] introduced canonical bases for pairs of subspaces. This line of development lead to the CS (cosine-sine) decomposition of a partitioned orthogonal matrix introduced implicitly by Davis and Kahan [8, 1970], and explicitly by <ref> [42, 1977] </ref>. The CS decomposition can in turn be used to derive the generalized singular value decomposition of a matrix, either in the original form introduced by Van Loan [47, 1975] or in the revised version of Paige and Saunders [35, 1981].

Reference-contexts: In 1846, Jacobi [25] gave his famous algorithm for diagonalizing a symmetric matrix, and in a posthumous paper [26, 1857] he obtained the LU decomposition by decomposing a bilinear form in the style of Gauss. Weierstrass <ref> [50, 1868] </ref> established canonical forms for pairs of bilinear functions | what we should today call the generalized eigenvalue problem. Thus the advent of the singular value decomposition in 1873 is seen as one of a long line of results on canonical forms. <p> Jordan notes that the former problem had been considered by Kronecker [31, 1866] in a different form, and the latter by Weierstrass <ref> [50, 1868] </ref>. 3 Jordan's argument is not very clear.
