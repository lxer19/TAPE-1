Abstract: This paper raises the question of the connection between embodiment and higher-level cognition which has been eloquently addressed before, but has not yet received much focus in the AI community. The paper then proceeds to break the question down into subparts, and address how each can be approached and studied. Finally, the paper briefly overviews two directions of our work: group behavior and imitative behavior, and describes their relation to the issue of embodiment and cognition.

Reference-contexts: and animal behavior (including humanoid robots) automatically assume a negative answer to the questions above by separating control and cognition? Partially due to AI's legacy of designer-imposed modularity, almost all of today's systems separate the low and high levels of reasoning, even if the latter are themselves none too high <ref> (Brooks & Stein 1994) </ref>. The question of this separation has been a topic of hot dispute for the past decade in the robot/agent control community, where reactive, deliberative, hybrid, and behavior-based systems have all been proposed, demonstrated, and debated as alternatives (Mataric 1995, Mataric 1992a, Brooks 1991).

Reference-contexts: of AI have begun to address this problem, as discussed below. * Is human higher-level cognition based on so-called lower-level metaphors and constructs including spatial, motor, and social ones? What might human non-spatial/non-motor representations come from and look like? The abundance of spatial and body-based metaphors in human linguistic expressions <ref> (Lakoff & Johnson 1980, Johnson 1987, Lakoff 1992) </ref> can be used as evidence for the body as the foundational system of reference for higher-level as well as lower-level reasoning.

Reference-contexts: As argued above, most adaptive systems involve both cognitive and subcognitive processes. The tension between what is typically referred to as low-level control (e.g., motor control, obstacle avoidance, navigation) and high-level cognition (e.g., planning) is ubiquitous in adaptive systems ranging from path-planning robots to information agents <ref> (Maes 1994) </ref>. One of the key aspects of such systems is the abstraction of data/information between different modules.

Reference-contexts: One of the key aspects of such systems is the abstraction of data/information between different modules. Fully reactive systems (Brooks 1986, Agre & Chapman 1987, Rosenschein & Kaelbling 1986), behavior-based systems <ref> (Mataric 1991, Mataric 1992c, Maes 1989) </ref> and hybrid systems (Firby 1987, Arkin 1989, Georgeff & Lansky 1987, Payton 1990, Connell 1991) have all been proposed as alternatives to solving the data abstraction problem in control.

McClelland 1986) </ref>. Historically not separated into modules, these systems present, to many, the most promising alternative. However, they are also yet to be scaled up to contain both low-level control and high-level cognition.
