Reference-contexts: We are looking at an environment where native ATM is used everywhere, as it is described in <ref> [1] </ref>. This is illustrated in Figure 2. In recent years, the deployment of ATM network equipment has gathered pace. One of the most promising areas for the introduction of an ATM-based network is ATM LANs, which are also known as third generation LANs.

Reference-contexts: Equipment that are attached to these ATM LANs and ATM WANs include: * Workstations with ATM interfaces There are lot of these already in deployment. Therefore security mechanisms compatible to this is highly desirable. 3 * Workstations with cryptographic-capable ATM interfaces * ATM devices such as ATM Cameras <ref> [2] </ref>, ATM Disk etc * Multimedia workstations such those based on Desk Area Network (DAN) [3] * Home ATM appliances built around the Home Area Network (HAN) * Wireless ATM devices 2 Private ATM LANs are sometime considered to be locally secure but traffic across the interconnected ATM WANs are however

However, all components are treated as would be the components of a workstation. This is as shown in Figure 3.

Reference-contexts: Therefore the gateway switch between the ATM LAN and the ATM WAN can be treated as a security firewall. As a result it is desirable that the gateway switch will possess the necessary hardware to performs the necessary cryptographic functions. Independent research at MCNC <ref> [4, 5] </ref> is based on a similar viewpoint. The granularity of protection at this firewall normally will fall into the categories of application layer firewall or network layer firewall [6]. Tennenhouse [7] has described the principle of avoiding unnecessary multiplexing in the ATM environment that we are considering. <p> The countermeasure that we are considering includes both data confidentiality and data origin authentication. Independent work in <ref> [4, 5] </ref> has considered only the importance of data confidentiality. While this is important, maybe more so in a military style environment, it is felt that the guarantee of data origin authentication can be equally or even more useful. <p> In this paper, we are also proposing a number of key management protocols but we emphasis a more fundamental approach in examining the clean integration of such key management protocols with the design of the the ATM signalling protocol. In <ref> [4, 5] </ref>, compatibility with the current signalling standard and transparency of operation is stressed. The key management protocol is carried out either over the data channel or extra channel setup for such purpose. This is a rather ad hoc approach.

Reference-contexts: Most of the traditional cryptographic mechanisms operates up to ten of Mbps range when implemented in software and up to a few hundred Mbps when implemented in hardware. Even though the state-of-the-art high speed encryption device <ref> [8] </ref> operates at Gbps, it works under the assumption that all data is protected under the same key and there is a big overhead to change the cryptographic context. Due to the key agile requirement as discussion above, this is not the ideal candidate for securing ATM.

Reference-contexts: The ATM cell payload is 48 bytes and this restricts us to block cipher that operates on block size less than 384 bits, if we want to avoid getting into the complication of cross-cell cryptographic operations. This rules out algorithm such as RSA <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This rules out algorithm such as RSA [9]. For efficiency reason, we also like to have alignment of data in the cell with the cryptographic block. 3.4 Support for Open Multi Service Networks It is envisaged that future development of ATM networks is towards Open Multi Service Network (OMSN) <ref> [10] </ref>, which allow third party software to be used as well as allow third party to provide services. The creation of an OMSN will open up new possibilities of use and abuse.

Reference-contexts: The creation of an OMSN will open up new possibilities of use and abuse. One possible approach to produce an Open Service Support Architecture (OSSA) in an OMSN as identified in <ref> [11] </ref>. 3.5 Secure ATM Charging ATM's ability to support multi-service traffic complicate the accounting and auditing practice due to the potentially large number of traffic classes. The task of finding a suitable tariffing scheme or economic model for running the ATM network is an interesting challenge.

Reference-contexts: Since AAL5 is a very widely implemented ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL), we will use this as the primary example, though many of the concepts are applicable to other AALs. Operating at a suitable AAL abstraction not only allows the security function to fit in with the application data unit <ref> [12] </ref>, it also increase network efficiency and simplify the operations of implementing the security function. This is particularly true when we are dealing with data integrity as we shall see in later sections.

Reference-contexts: This will still have the problem of cache miss on the cryptographic context. The consideration of multimedia traffic processing in the context of the DAN work, also resulted in the proposal of flexible cache architecture for QoS guarantee stream processing <ref> [17, 18] </ref>. One feature of such an architecture is the ability to "lock" certain data into the cache so that the penalty of a fetch from DRAM is never incurred.

Reference-contexts: The efficient usage of the ATM network and end system handling of data are very much dependent on the selection of the right AAL. It is clear, e.g. from the experience of running TCP over ATM <ref> [19] </ref>, that selective operation at the ATM level using information from the AAL can highly optimise communication efficiency. Applying this approach to every conceivable AAL types is however not considered possible.

Reference-contexts: That is, the TCB could allocate unused VCI in the VCI space (pseudo) randomly in a non-monotonic sequence. Depending upon the randomisation characteristic of the allocation algorithm, the bandwidth of the VCI channel can be reduced to negligible values. For some signalling system, such as ATM Forum UNI <ref> [20] </ref>, the VCI is allocated by the initiator. Therefore the initiator will have the control over the covert channel and in some way be able to control the bandwidth. 5.9 Implementations Our implementation work uses the Fairisle Port Controller [21] to simulate the functions of the CryptoNode. <p> We have seen in recent months various proposals of authentication/key management protocols for the establishment of session keys for the secure channel. However, most of these proposals concentrate on finding a particular one (or familiar of) key management protocol to fit in the ATM Forum UNI protocol <ref> [20] </ref>. In this paper, we are also proposing a number of key management protocols but we emphasis a more fundamental approach in examining the clean integration of such key management protocols with the design of the the ATM signalling protocol. <p> If the ATM Forum UNI protocol <ref> [20] </ref> is used, this is restricted to two-ways. If the MSNL signalling protocol [28] is used, we can extend that to three phases.

Reference-contexts: The Fairisle Port Controller basically consists of the network and the processor 17 section of the CryptoNode. Thus in our experiment, we are using the Fairisle Port Controller processor section to perform the dual functions of crypto and processor section of the CryptoNode. Fawn <ref> [22] </ref>, a micro-kernel that is capable of supporting QoS guarantee, runs on the Fairisle Port Controller as the controlling operating system. With such an operating system, we are able to allocate a guaranteed share of the CPU for the handling of the key hint event while processing the cell streams.

Reference-contexts: Firewalling and intrusion detection for ATM are also discussed in this context. Also in the control plane, we investigate the possible extensions to ATM routing and call setup protocol to achieve Byzantine robustness. Two schemes are considered here, one with an integration with the P-NNI specification <ref> [23] </ref>, while the other call setup scheme uses secure broadcast to achieve Byzantine robustness.

Reference-contexts: Two schemes are considered here, one with an integration with the P-NNI specification [23], while the other call setup scheme uses secure broadcast to achieve Byzantine robustness. The more detailed discussion and design of these security issues involve in the control plane can be found in <ref> [24] </ref>. 6.1 Network Control Model Our network control model share the same philosophy as the DCAN project [25], of devolving the management and control of switches and end devices into a coherent external system, therefore removing the need for switch and device manufacturers to capture these functions within their equipment. <p> Proposal to have a more expressive extensions to IDL and the RPC system and also a detailed discussion of security enhanced MSN-CMA protocol (with point-to-multipoint considerations) can be found in <ref> [24] </ref>. The other infrastructure consideration is the Certification Authority structure required for public key system. Much of these is generic to other systems. One factor that might influence the choice of Certification Authority mechanism is the short time scale of operation in the control plane. <p> This might affects decision such as whether using pull or push model of handling certificate. Certificate revocation can also make a performance impact. Detailed discussion can be found in <ref> [24] </ref>. 6.6 NNI Routing and Inter-Domain Policy Routing The Network Node Interface (NNI) is the interface between network nodes. The ATM Forum has an ongoing effort to define a Private Network Node Interface (P-NNI) protocol for use within networks that use NSAP format ATM address.

Reference-contexts: The more detailed discussion and design of these security issues involve in the control plane can be found in [24]. 6.1 Network Control Model Our network control model share the same philosophy as the DCAN project <ref> [25] </ref>, of devolving the management and control of switches and end devices into a coherent external system, therefore removing the need for switch and device manufacturers to capture these functions within their equipment. This is illustrated in Figure 10.

Reference-contexts: This is illustrated in Figure 10. The control and management of multi-service networks is viewed as a distributed problem and distributed platform such as ANSAware <ref> [26] </ref>. 19 6.2 Signalling Security issues in signalling can be broadly divided into two categories: * Security Signalling This is the ability in the signalling system to provide the capability to invoke security service provide by the ATM network, such as the data integrity and confidentiality service in the user plane
Reference: [27] <author> L. G. Pierson and T. D. Tarman, </author> <title> "Requirements for Security Signalling," ATM Forum Contribution, </title> <month> February </month> <year> 1995. </year>
Reference-contexts: The underlying signalling protocol must therefore accommodate such changes. We also see that the key management protocol and other security services must be integrated into the ATM service. This is also a view shared in <ref> [27] </ref>. The strengths in using this approach are: 1. There is no need for any entity involved in providing security service to peek into the user channel. 2. <p> In fact, we are treating the security profile of a secure liaison as part of the QoS parameters and thus negotiated at call setup time. This is similar to the view expressed in <ref> [27] </ref> Possible QoS parameters on a liaison are: * Byzantine robustness call setup (see Section 6.9) * Covert channel free length: all transmitted frames are of equal length, rate: each transmitter transmits at a constant average rate artificial frames are generated and contain no real data, but are indistinguishable from frames

Reference-contexts: If the ATM Forum UNI protocol [20] is used, this is restricted to two-ways. If the MSNL signalling protocol <ref> [28] </ref> is used, we can extend that to three phases. <p> We have based our secure signalling work on the signalling protocol of Multi-Service Network Connection Management Architecture (MSN-CMA) as described in <ref> [28] </ref>. This is a three-way handshake protocol, designed to avoid the problem of unreliability of the signalling network causing confusion to the state of the connection. In MSN-CMA, an ATM connection is called a liaison. Therefore a secure channel in MSN-CMA is a secure liaison.

Reference-contexts: In MSN-CMA, an ATM connection is called a liaison. Therefore a secure channel in MSN-CMA is a secure liaison. The signalling protocol is also 22 RPC-based. This enable us to develop our network control model in the direction of the TINA consortium <ref> [33] </ref> in which distributed processing environment is used to provide the infrastructure for interaction. The other observation from the above protocols is that although we have avoided the problem of synchronised clock, we still need to generate good random numbers.

Reference-contexts: The P-NNI signalling protocol performs source routing by the source network node. A designated transit list (DTL) that described the complete route to the destination is inserted into the signalling request. This source routing approach can be integrated very well with the Inter-Domain Policy Routing (IDPR) <ref> [34] </ref> to provide network policy support for access control. Much of the mechanisms in IDPR has to do with the setting up of the policy route using the SETUP packet and retaining of state in the router. <p> However, for ATM, most of these complications has been taken care of by the NNI signalling protocol. Thus we can have a very clean integrate the concept of IDPR for access control into ATM network P-NNI and results in a simpler system. In IDPR <ref> [34] </ref>, the Visa protocol is used for stub network policy enforcement and special route setup scheme and cryptographic signature to handle transit internetwork traffic.

Reference-contexts: But for a connection oriented protocol with a clear separation of control plane from the user plane, such as ATM, the access control can be done during connection setup time. The fine granularity of ATM cells also ensure low delay through a firewall. It has been proposed <ref> [35] </ref> to include higher layer application authenticator as an Information Element in the signalling message. We do however rely on the trust on the higher layer application to not generate any malicious data.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we outline two schemes that achieve this. 6.9.1 Robust P-NNI The P-NNI routing protocol floods P-NNI topology state packets (PTSP) in a manner similar to current flooding of link state packet for protocol such as OSPF. Therefore techniques that achieved robust flooding for link state packet <ref> [36] </ref> can be modified to handle robust PTSP flooding. We need to firstly use a public key distributor to distribute the public keys of all the nodes. The public key distributor flood the public key list packet. <p> The link state packet is then flooded. Now the switch node should be able to compute a route, in the normal manner that P-NNI protocol does and construct a DTL. Hierarchical networks as is possible with P-NNI can also be handled as described in <ref> [36] </ref>. 6.9.2 Robust Call Setup The other more radical approach is to deliver the call setup signalling message using robust flooding. Key to robust flooding is guaranteed resource for each source. Therefore at each of the switch node, we need to reserve buffer for the call setup signalling message.

Reference-contexts: However, a re-dimensioning of the signalling channel might be needed given the extra signalling traffic. The detailed mapping of the mechanism to the P-NNI protocol and the Robust Call Setup scheme can be found in <ref> [37] </ref>. 26 7 Management Plane Security The ATM network management framework is not fully developed. Therefore we based our discussions in this section on some of the current development. 7.1 Start of the Day Bootstrapping The secure bootstrapping process of ATM switches is crucial to the later security operations.

Reference-contexts: Yet it is one of the area that has not been investigated in much detail. This is particularly important to the provision of open multi service networks. There is an increasing need for booting ATM switches with third party software, using a third party booting service. <ref> [38] </ref> present a case study of secure ATM switch booting based on the Fairisle ATM network.

Reference-contexts: The UNI Management Entity (UME) response to SNMP command received over the ATM UNI through the ILMI. In order to give the ILMI some security functionality, it can be enhanced with the SNMP security protocol <ref> [39] </ref>. An initial key exchange stage should also be added using the ILMI PVC to establish mutual authentication and generate session key for the secure SNMP session.
