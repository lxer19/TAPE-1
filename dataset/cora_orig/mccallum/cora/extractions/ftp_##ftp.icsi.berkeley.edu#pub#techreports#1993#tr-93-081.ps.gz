Abstract: When searching a path in a digraph, usually the following situation is given: Every node v may be entered by an arbitrary incoming arc (u; v), and v may be left by an arbitrary outgoing arc (v; w). In this paper, however, we consider graphs with valve nodes, which cannot arbitrarily be entered and left. More precisely, a movable valve is installed in each valve node v. Entering v via (u; v) and leaving it via (v; w) is only possible if the current position of the valve generates a connection between these two arcs; if, however, the current valve adjustment interrupts this connection then every path using the arcs (u; v) and (v; w) is interrupted, too. We investigate the complexity of the following problem We show that this problem can be solved in deterministic polynomial time if all valve nodes belong to a particular class of valves; otherwise the problem is N P-complete.

Reference-contexts: More precisely, it is assumed that valves are intalled in several nodes of the given network (see Figure 1). A path may only use arcs that are connected by the current valve adjustment. This setting is of great practical relevance. E.g., Braun's diploma thesis <ref> [1] </ref> is about systems of pipes in breweries where several crossings of pipes are equipped with valves. <p> Both papers <ref> [1] </ref> and [2] are about the existence of a valve adjustment that allows a path P from a node s to another node t.

Reference-contexts: Both papers [1] and <ref> [2] </ref> are about the existence of a valve adjustment that allows a path P from a node s to another node t. Braun gives a heuristic algorithm to find such a path P with optimal length; in [2], however, it is shown an exact solution of this problem is N P-complete <p> Both papers [1] and <ref> [2] </ref> are about the existence of a valve adjustment that allows a path P from a node s to another node t. Braun gives a heuristic algorithm to find such a path P with optimal length; in [2], however, it is shown an exact solution of this problem is N P-complete for a great class of valves. <p> We first generate the subgraphs G representing the literals x and x - , - = 1; : : : ; n. Then we complete the graph G. The global structure of this construction is quite similar to that of Theorem 3.4 in <ref> [2] </ref> In both proofs, the fact that all valves of G are in horizontal and vertical position corresponds to f (x -) = 1 and f (x - ) = 0, resp.; these two valve adjustments of G are called consistent . <p> It is our aim to restrict our attention to consistent valve adjustments. So the graph G in Theorem 3.4 of <ref> [2] </ref> is constructed such that (A) C is satisfiable iff (B) There exists some valve adjustment allowing an s-t-path iff (C) There exists a consistent valve adjustment allowing an s-t-path. <p> This means that the non-consistent valve adjustments must admit at least the paths that are possible by consistent ones. This is the reason why copying the graphs G on page 94 of <ref> [2] </ref> is not good in this situation. We need another construction basing of "parallel connection" of valves. <p> So the construction of a #-admissible s-t-path fails. After considering this important special case we next investigate general classes T of valve types. In analogy to Definition 3.2 b) of <ref> [2] </ref> we introduce a set T * with the following property: If T T * then PBVA d (T ) can be solved in deterministic polynomial time; otherwise it is N P-complete. Definition 4.2. a) Given an abstract valve t = hk ; k + ; f i. <p> An example is given in Fig. 4, where a valve type t flfl = h2; 2; f flfl i with f flfl (1) = f1g and f flfl (2) = f1; 2g is shown. It is interesting to compare the result 4.5 and Theorem 3.5 in <ref> [2] </ref> both of them having to do with t flfl : c) The set of all t described in b) is defined as T * . The following result describes the structure of valves with unique minimal set of connections: Lemma 4.3.

Reference-contexts: elementary iff all nodes x 0 ; : : : ; x l1 are pairwise distinct and x l 62 fx 1 ; : : : ; x l1 g; in particular, elementary cycles with x 0 = x l are possible. (The definition of elementary paths is analogous to <ref> [3] </ref>, p. 28.) If P = [v 0 ; : : : ; v l ] is given then any path Q = [v 0 ; : : : ; v ] with l is called a prefix of P ("Q P ").
