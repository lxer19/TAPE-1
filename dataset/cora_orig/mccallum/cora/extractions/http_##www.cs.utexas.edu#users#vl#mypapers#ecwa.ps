Reference-contexts: One significant step was made by Michael Gelfond, Halina Przymusinska and Teodor Przymusinski, who came up with the modification of Minker's generalized closed world assumption that is particularly closely related to circumscription|the "extended" closed world assumption, or ECWA <ref> [ Gelfond et al., 1989 ] </ref> . <p> The goal of this note is to show that the theorem from <ref> [ Gelfond et al., 1989 ] </ref> relating the ECWA to circumscription can be proved in a more general setting, and in a simpler way. <p> We will need the following property of well-founded sentences (for related results, see [ Marczewski, 1951 ] , [ Lyndon, 1959 ] , [ Etherington et al., 1985 ] , [ Etherington, 1988 ] , <ref> [ Gelfond et al., 1989 ] </ref> and [ Suchenek, 1990 ] ). Theorem 1. Let A be a well-founded sentence, and let G be a sentence which contains no symbols from Z and no negative occurrences of symbols from P . <p> such that A (p; z) ^ F (p) ^ p P: Using the second conjunctive term of A c (P; Z), that is, (1), we derive from this formula p = P and then F (P ). 4 4 Discussion Let us compare Theorem 2 with the corresponding result from <ref> [ Gelfond et al., 1989 ] </ref> . The definition of the ECWA from Section 4 of that paper can be stated as follows. <p> In <ref> [ Gelfond et al., 1989 ] </ref> , A is actually a set of first-order axioms, not necessarily finite, rather than a single sentence. <p> For this reason, we do not lose generality by assuming that A is a single sentence. Corollary 4.7 from <ref> [ Gelfond et al., 1989 ] </ref> asserts that a structure satisfies A c iff it is a model of ECWA (A; P ; Z). Theorem 2 differs from this result in two ways. First, instead of (6) and (7), it assumes that A is well-founded. <p> Indeed, any sentence G can be written as a conjunction of disjunctions of ground 5 literals, and applying (ii) to a conjunction amounts to applying it to each conjunctive term separately. This analysis shows that Corollary 4.7 from <ref> [ Gelfond et al., 1989 ] </ref> is subsumed by Theorem 2. Acknowledgements I am grateful to G. N.

Reference-contexts: Recall that the circumscription operator transforms any sentence A (P; Z) into the conjunction of A (P; Z) and the minimality condition :9pz (A (p; z) ^ p &lt; P ) (1) ( <ref> [ Genesereth and Nilsson, 1987 ] </ref> , Chapter 6). We denote this conjunction by A c (P; Z). A sentence A (P; Z) is well-founded if it entails 9pz (A c (p; z) ^ p P ) (2) (see [ Lifschitz, 1986 ] , Proposition 2.1).

We understand entailment semantically (in view of the incompleteness of second-order logic, this is different from the deductive understanding of entailment). <p> We denote this conjunction by A c (P; Z).

Reference-contexts: The semantic definition is based on the idea of a "minimal model"|the concept that, two years earlier, led John McCarthy to the theory of circumscription <ref> [ McCarthy, 1980 ] </ref> . The relationship between the uses of minimal models by McCarthy and by Minker is far from being simple. Minker's definitions are, in a number of ways, less general.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This note adds another link to the chain of results that begins with the main theorem of Jack Minker's paper "On Indefinite Databases and the Closed World Assumption" <ref> [ Minker, 1982 ] </ref> . Minker's work was motivated by the need to understand the relationship between two concepts of a database. One concept is "extensional": A database consists of data as stored in traditional relational databases. <p> Reiter was interested primarily in the databases that are "definite," that is, contain no disjunctive information. Minker's goal was to generalize the closed world assumption to the case of indefinite databases. In <ref> [ Minker, 1982 ] </ref> , we find two definitions of the generalized closed world assumption|"syntactic" and "semantic." Their equivalence is the main result of the paper.

Reference-contexts: In an extensional database, on the other hand, the same information would have to be represented by a large collection of data. In the late seventies, several researchers recognized the importance of the additional expressivity given by the deductive view, and the theory of deductive databases came into existence <ref> [ Minker, 1988 ] </ref> . 1 The claim that an extensional database is merely a set of atomic axioms ignores, however, an important detail. A set of ground atoms provides only positive information: Each atom tells us that some relation R holds for some tuple of objects a.

Reference-contexts: This distinction was described by Ray Reiter as the difference between "open world" and "closed world" databases <ref> [ Reiter, 1978 ] </ref> .

Reiter was interested primarily in the databases that are "definite," that is, contain no disjunctive information.
