Abstract: Locating the patient accurately in real-time is necessary for many problems in medical robotics. Current solutions are expensive or inconvenient. We show progress toward solving these problems by using ultrasound to track CT reference features in real-time. We compute the locations of target features in the ultrasonic images relative to the CT reference features.

Reference-contexts: Framed strategies place some fiduciary marks (e.g. pins) in the rigid structures (e.g. bones) of the patient and track them. Framed strategies require the use of an additional operation to insert the pins. An example of a framed system is the ISS Robodoc/ Orthodoc system <ref> [1] </ref>. Frameless strategies either track easily-removed markers on deformable structures, such as the skin, or track natural features of rigid structures in the body, avoiding the use of fiduciary markers altogether. Frameless strategies that track markers on deformable structures suffer from errors introduced by the distortion of those structures.

Reference-contexts: Frameless strategies that track markers on deformable structures suffer from errors introduced by the distortion of those structures. Examples of systems using frameless strategies include the retrospective patient image registration system developed by Tan, et al <ref> [2] </ref> and the surgical navigation system developed by Kato, et al [3]. Frameless Ultrasonic Given the particular requirements of the patient-location problem (accurate, inexpensive, safe), ultrasound appears to provide an almost ideal frameless solution. Typical ultrasonic imaging equipment has a resolution of 0.5 mm axially and 1.2 mm laterally [6].

Reference-contexts: It is inexpensive compared with other imaging technologies. Furthermore, the side effects of long-term exposure to diagnostic levels of ultrasonic radiation are believed to pose minimal hazard to the patient and the surgeon, provided that the spatial-peak, temporal-average (SPTA) of the dosage is less than 100 mW/ cm 2 <ref> [7] </ref>. Implementation Our system locates the patient by identifying and tracking corners, places where the curvature 1 reaches a local extremum 2 , on a designated bone in the patient.

The curvature of , called , and its first derivative, , are then calculated and used to locate the corner points, which occur at the extrema of . Sometimes extraneous corners will be found between legitimate ones.
