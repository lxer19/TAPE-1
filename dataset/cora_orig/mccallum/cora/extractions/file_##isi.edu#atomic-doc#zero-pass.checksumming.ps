Reference-contexts: It has been ar gued that locating the end-to-end checksum in the header is a source of unneccessary overhead, since it prevents source hardware from performing on-the-fly checksum calculation <ref> [1] </ref> [2][3][4][5]. We present a zero-pass mechanism for the creation and insertion of embedded end-to-end checksums that requires neither trailers nor specialized hardware assistance to transmit a packet.

Reference-contexts: Zero-Pass Mechanism for Checksuming Network-Layer Payloads Each incoming packet passes through the network interface input-channel logic before it enters system or buf fer memory. This provides an opportunity to calculate an end-to-end checksum across the link-layer packet without requiring an extra pass over the protected data <ref> [3] </ref>.
