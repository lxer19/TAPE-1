Abstract: We present an integrated approach between anatomical and physiological modeling that is useful in medical training and visualization of internal body organ function. In particular, we model the breathing mechanism in the respiratory system because it involves physiological change, such as gas exchange, that depends on gross anatomical deformations (volume changes). We describe our initial model of the lungs for a simplified process of normal, quiet breathing. Our system consists of two integrated levels of abstraction: (i) geometric and physics-based modeling (shape extraction, motion, deformations, and graphical rendering); (ii) mathematical relationships among parameters that express physical laws and physiological processes. We present experiments that demonstrate graphically the organ geometry, physics, and physiological dynamics.

First, we are developing the deformable modeling to improve anatomical fidelity. The critical next step is finding human data to which we can apply our techniques.

Reference-contexts: The consequence is that a necessary characteristic for virtual surgical simulators [16], reactivity, that organs must react appropriately to manipulation or cutting, such as by bleeding or leaking fluid, cannot be achieved. Some approaches in visualization [17] and anatomical modeling (such as automatic segmentation of images <ref> [2] </ref>) advocate a `knowledge-based' approach, identifying the need for functional knowledge. However, VOXEL-MAN [17] uses that knowledge only to index the anatomical structures, and the Digital Anatomist Program [2] does not currently use it for more than providing text about the function to a user. <p> Some approaches in visualization [17] and anatomical modeling (such as automatic segmentation of images <ref> [2] </ref>) advocate a `knowledge-based' approach, identifying the need for functional knowledge.

Traditional physiological models are continuous dynamic simulations that depend on both anatomical and physiological knowledge.

They indicate the appropriate values for the parameters when the system is at rest (at the end of normal expiration, FRC), and at the end of normal inspiration (TV).

Reference-contexts: Our system consists of two integrated levels of abstraction: (i) geometric and physics-based modeling (shape extraction, motion, deformations, and graphical rendering), which uses the techniques developed by Metaxas et al <ref> [4, 18] </ref> (outlined in Section 3); (ii) mathematical relationships among parameters that express physical laws and physiological processes (described in Section 4). Currently, we use the qsim framework [5] to model processes explicitly as sets of differential equations over physiological parameters.

Reference-contexts: Currently, we use the qsim framework <ref> [5] </ref> to model processes explicitly as sets of differential equations over physiological parameters. We also discuss ideas to organize these equations for the appropriate circumstances and mention one of the types of problems we envision solving by applying this integrated approach. <p> Quantitative methods, however, will only present one, and may miss possible behaviors because of the required precision in variable and initial state definitions. Qualitative simulation, qsim in particular, has the desirable property that it will not miss any possible real behaviors of the system <ref> [5] </ref>. Unfortunately, it may predict behaviors that are not physically realizable. <p> We encode our physiological models currently as sets of qualitative differential equations in the qualitative simulation framework qsim <ref> [5] </ref>. We use the qsim simulator to determine all possible qualitative solutions for our models. Qualitative differential equations are mathematical relationships analogous to ordinary differential equations, but are based on a qualitative algebra. The qsim algorithm essentially performs a discrete state-based simulation [19].

Therefore, state changes represent interesting moments of the system where parameters change values (in accordance with the qualitative mean value theorem and consistent with the constraints that the differential equations impose).

Reference-contexts: The FEM provides a means to discover regional characteristics of the lung under various normal and pathological conditions [8]. These characteristics might be regional differences in material properties, pleural pressure dynamics, volume, and blood flow. In the biomedical model-based reasoning literature, detailed in [19], approaches such as AI/MM <ref> [7] </ref> and many higher-level physiological reasoners exploit anatomical connectivity but do not otherwise model space. We are not arguing that functional anatomy is necessary for all applications.

The models have global deformation parameters which represent the salient shape features of natural parts, and local deformation parameters which capture shape details. <p> Through these forces the models conform to the given dataset. This system of differential equations is discretized and solved through time using standard numerical techniques. In addition, our models through appropriate modifications can be used for animating deformable objects <ref> [9] </ref>. The geometric definition of our models allows translational, rotational, global and local degrees of freedom whose changes make our models move in space and deform.

Reference-contexts: A promising area for such combinations is the emerging field of Virtual Surgery.

The consequence is that a necessary characteristic for virtual surgical simulators [16], reactivity, that organs must react appropriately to manipulation or cutting, such as by bleeding or leaking fluid, cannot be achieved.
