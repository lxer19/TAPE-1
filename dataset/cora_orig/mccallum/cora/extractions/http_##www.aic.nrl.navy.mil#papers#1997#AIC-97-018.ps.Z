Abstract: This report documents NACODAE, the Navy Conversational Decision Aids Environment being developed at the Navy Center for Applied Research in Artificial Intelligence (NCARAI), which is a branch of the Naval Research Laboratory. NA-CODAE is a software prototype that is being developed under the Practical Advances in Case-Based Reasoning project, which is funded by the Office for Naval Research, for the purpose of assisting Navy and other DoD personnel in decision aids tasks such as system maintenance, operational training, crisis response planning, logistics, fault diagnosis, target classification, and meteorological nowcasting. Implemented in Java, NACODAE can be used on any machine containing a Java virtual machine (e.g., PCs, Unix). This document describes and exemplifies NACODAE's capabilities. Our goal is to transition this tool to operational personnel, and to continue its enhancement through user feedback and by testing recent research advances in case-based reasoning and related areas.

Reference-contexts: These simple extensions will all be incorporated in the next few weeks and months. We also have more ambitious goals in mind for enhancing NACODAE. 1. Database integration: We plan to integrate a PARKA-DB <ref> (Hendler et al., 1996) </ref> API to provide thesaurus support and additional inferencing capabilities. In particular, we want to prevent users from having to answer questions that are obviously answered in their text description input.

Reference-contexts: Numeric rankings: While NACODAE uses numeric rankings for questions and solutions in its two displays, they should be normalized between [0,100]. 3. Internal disjunction: This allows users to specify multiple possible answers for a single (list) question. 4. Feature weighting: Many methods for automatically weighting features have been proposed <ref> (Wettschereck & Aha, 1995) </ref>, but no automated approach has been incorporated into a CCBR system. We will incorporate some methods after a thorough evaluation. 5. Hierarchy displays: Some users will want to see the structure of the case library as displayed in hierarchies.
