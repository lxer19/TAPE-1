Title: FORMS: A Flexible Object Recognition and Modeling System  
Author: Song Chun Zhu and A.L. Yuille 
Note: Int'l Journal of Computer Vision, Vol. 20, No. 3, Dec, 1996 (final version).  
Abstract: We describe a flexible object recognition and modeling system (FORMS) which represents and recognizes animate objects from their silhouettes. This consists of a model for generating the shapes of animate objects which gives a formalism for solving the inverse problem of object recognition. We model all objects at three levels of complexity: (i) the primitives, (ii) the mid-grained shapes, which are deformations of the primitives, and (iii) objects constructed by using a grammar to join mid-grained shapes together. The deformations of the primitives can be characterized by principal component analysis or modal analysis. When doing recognition the representations of these objects are obtained in a bottom-up manner from their silhouettes by a novel method for skeleton extraction and part segmentation based on deformable circles. These representations are then matched to a database of prototypical objects to obtain a set of candidate interpretations. These interpretations are verified in a top-down process. The system is demonstrated to be stable in the presence of noise, the absence of parts, the presence of additional parts, and considerable variations in articulation and viewpoint. Finally, we describe how such a representation scheme can be automatically learnt from examples.

Reference-contexts: Learning. Figure 35 also shows the structure of dataflow for learning. Even though learning such simple shapes as parallelograms was claimed to be a hard problem within Valiant's PAC-learning framework <ref> [1] </ref> [35], it seems a trivial task for FORMS to learn flexible objects. As shown in figure 35 the total knowledge base in FORMS is organized into three parts: (i) the deformation modes, (ii) the butcher's shop, and (iii) the skeleton graphs.

Reference-contexts: In FORMS the similarity measure is based on the statistical variations of the representations of the shapes. Our approach builds on three important themes in object recognition. The first is the attempt to represent objects in terms of elementary parts, such as generalized cylinders [3], [7] [21] [9] <ref> [2] </ref>. The second is the use of deformable templates and deformable models [12], [40] [37], [33], [29], [15]. The third is the effort to solve recognition in a bottom-up/top-down loop using specific knowledge of the models to resolve ambiguities &lt;occurring in the bottom-up process [24].

The first is the attempt to represent objects in terms of elementary parts, such as generalized cylinders [3], [7] [21] [9] [2]. The second is the use of deformable templates and deformable models [12], [40] [37], <ref> [33] </ref>, [29], [15]. The third is the effort to solve recognition in a bottom-up/top-down loop using specific knowledge of the models to resolve ambiguities &lt;occurring in the bottom-up process [24]. The general architecture of our approach is shown in figure 1.

Reference-contexts: Learning. Figure 35 also shows the structure of dataflow for learning. Even though learning such simple shapes as parallelograms was claimed to be a hard problem within Valiant's PAC-learning framework [1] <ref> [35] </ref>, it seems a trivial task for FORMS to learn flexible objects. As shown in figure 35 the total knowledge base in FORMS is organized into three parts: (i) the deformation modes, (ii) the butcher's shop, and (iii) the skeleton graphs.

Reference-contexts: Such graphs can be described in a formal grammatical manner. Grammatical models of this type have been reported by Mandelbrot [20], Lindenmayer [18] and many others in computer graphics <ref> [36] </ref> 9 . They use simple line segments as primitives, and define grammatical rules to replace all line segments in the graph simultaneously to generate more complex graphs. In Man-delbrot's approach these rules will apply recursively to generate self-similar patterns. the segments of the tree have fixed lengths.

Reference-contexts: Our approach builds on three important themes in object recognition. The first is the attempt to represent objects in terms of elementary parts, such as generalized cylinders [3], [7] [21] [9] [2]. The second is the use of deformable templates and deformable models [12], [40] <ref> [37] </ref>, [33], [29], [15]. The third is the effort to solve recognition in a bottom-up/top-down loop using specific knowledge of the models to resolve ambiguities &lt;occurring in the bottom-up process [24]. The general architecture of our approach is shown in figure 1.

Reference-contexts: The modeling and recognition of such flexible objects is made difficult by the following factors: (i) the silhouettes of these objects will vary greatly with their articulation and the observer's viewpoint, so techniques such as linear combinations of views <ref> [38] </ref> or viewpoint interpolation [32] seem inapplicable, (ii) such objects rarely contain salient features, such as corners or straight lines, which often play a large role in recognizing rigid objects [13], [19] [16], (iii) such objects do not seem to possess geometric invariants of the type recently exploited for recognizing certain

Reference-contexts: Under the forces of climatic and geological changes, evolution generated a spectrum of animals ranging from fish to amphibia, reptiles, birds and tetrapods 1 . Elementary anatomical and physiological studies shows that all vertebrates are built upon a common plan <ref> [39] </ref>, [14] and share many common properties. These properties are: 1. Skeletons. Every vertebrate has a tree-like 2 skeleton consisting of spines for the neck, torso, and tail, and bones for the limbs. 3 Typical bones for the spine and limb are shown in figure 2. 2. Parts.
