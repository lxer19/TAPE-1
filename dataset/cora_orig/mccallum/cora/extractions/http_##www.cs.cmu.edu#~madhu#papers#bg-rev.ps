Abstract: Research in conceptual design methodologies based on bond graphs is reviewed. A brief summary of the bond-graph formalism is presented. Then each proposed design methodology in the design literature is analyzed with respect to the basic aim of the design problem and the bond graph notions that are used in the methodology. Further, the feasibility of using bond graphs to computationally support conceptual, parametric and configuration design tasks is discussed.

Reference-contexts: Numerous representations have been proposed to support the tasks in the above-mentioned design phases. A review of these representations and the design algorithms is presented in <ref> [1] </ref>. In this report, I focus on reviewing synthesis schemes that have been proposed used different aspects of a physical system modeling methodology called Bond graphs. There has been a recent surge in interest in using the bond graph formalism to support design tasks for a variety of reasons.

Reference-contexts: A brief review of Bond graphs In this section, I summarize the basic features of the bond-graph methodology. Extensive details are discussed in <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. Bond graphs are a means of modeling and analyzing the dynamics of physical systems in an unified manner. The dynamics of physical systems are derived by the application of instant-by-instant energy conservation. Systems are connected at places where power can flow between the systems. <p> This notion of causality is extended to one-port, two-port and three-port component models. I will describe the notions of causality for one-port models only. Causality notions regarding two-port and three-port models are described in <ref> [2] </ref>. A resistor can be represented by two equivalent relations, namely, e = (f ) or f = 1 (e), where the convention is that the variable on the left of the equality sign represents the output (dependent variable) and that on the left is the input (independent variable). <p> The bond-graph for the telescope drive system is shown at the bottom of Figure 2. 2.2. Analysis of physical systems using bond-graphs Bond-graphs of systems (including active bonds) can be algorithmically transformed into a system of state-space differential equations as described in <ref> [2] </ref>. The differential equations are solved numerically to obtain the time behavior of the state variables. The differential equation models can be used to obtain free response (no inputs to the system) and forced response of systems (inputs to the system).

Reference-contexts: Bond graphs have been primarily used to model and predict behavior of physical systems across multiple energy domains. There is a vast literature on bond graph models for a variety of electro-mechanical devices <ref> [4] </ref>. The bond graph method can be viewed as a generalized version of Kirchoff's laws across different energy domains. Further bond graphs can be algorithmically transformed into state-space or block diagram representations to enable synthesis of control systems.

Reference-contexts: When the object is released, the initial system decouples into two non-energy-interacting subsystems. The dynamics of this process cannot be modelled using bond-graphs. These interactions occur in systems such as part-feeding systems and material handling systems. Such interactions are discussed in <ref> [9] </ref>. 2.4. Bond graphs and design Bond graphs are primarily used for dynamic analysis of complex physical subsystems. The ability to model behavior of physical systems over time should enable the use of bond graphs for performing behavior synthesis.

Reference-contexts: In each summary, I discuss wherein the design methodology uses bond-graph notions and where it deviates from the bond-graph formalism. Bond-graphs were used by Ulrich and Seering for conceptual design of electro-mechanical systems. In <ref> [10] </ref>, the aim of the design problem is to generate a schematic model for a device from given specifications. The schematic model refers to a topology of interconnected bond graph elements. <p> Specification for such a device consists of effort and flow variable specifications at both input and output ports. Therefore the methodology proposed by Ulrich cannot synthesize power transforming devices. The synthesis procedure proposed in <ref> [10] </ref> makes an implicit assumption that the design space of behaviors defined by a network of bond graph elements is smaller than the physical embodiment. This hypothesis is based on the finite number of one-port, two-port and three-port component models necessary to model the dynamics of systems. <p> The problem that a single gear ratio can be generated by multiple tooth ratios leading to different gear pair embodiments is not addressed. In [12], the initial graph specification is modified by defining graph operations that add bond-graph elements in a manner similar to <ref> [10] </ref>. They view bond graph elements as defining a behavorial description language or grammar. Then design can be viewed as the process of transforming an initial graph (a sentence in the grammar) to a final graph through application of a sequence of productions. <p> Also design specification is given in terms of a particular class of devices e.g. gears. Verification at the behavior, parametric or at the embodiment level is not discussed. Dixon and Welch [15] use bond-graphs to generate physical embodiments from initial specifications that are similar to <ref> [10] </ref>. No type number is given nor the input and output are represented as chunks. The bond graph representation is annotated with notions of vectors, orientation and position information. Given the input-output parameter types and energy domains, an initial graph is retrieved from a library. <p> An infinite number of graphs can be formulated as the initial graph and they do not describe their scheme for generation of initial graphs. The design process deals with modifying the initial graph by adding new bond-graph elements in a manner similar to <ref> [10, 12] </ref>. Parametric values for the power and energy variables are computed based on the constitutive relations of the components. They attempt to extend the representation for design of static structures such as a hinged pin.

Reference-contexts: At the schematic level, the procedure does not deal with parametric aspects of the models. The verification procedure is dependent only on the order of the differential equation without giving insight into the structure of the differential equation. In <ref> [11] </ref>, the authors address the issue of function sharing at the embodiment level. A single physical entity can have multiple behaviors. For example, a piece of metal wire may be modelled as a resistor, inductor or a capacitor.

Reference-contexts: Neither the issue of generating embodiments for non-transformer bond graph elements nor parametric design is addressed. The problem that a single gear ratio can be generated by multiple tooth ratios leading to different gear pair embodiments is not addressed. In <ref> [12] </ref>, the initial graph specification is modified by defining graph operations that add bond-graph elements in a manner similar to [10].

Reference-contexts: Rinderle et al.[12, 13, 14] have used bond graphs primarily to perform embodiment design. They view design as a transformation process from the schematic level (i.e. the topology of bond graph elements) to the embodiment level. In <ref> [13] </ref>, the design specification consists of a bond graph that spans input and output. An example from the domain of gear design is illustrated. In the design specification, it is assumed apriori that gears are required.

Reference-contexts: Productions based on R,C,I,-0-,-1- and GY elements are not defined and it is unclear how this approach may be extended to capture non-linear input output behavior. Further, it is not obvious how one can represent the variety of time histories of inputs and outputs in devices. In <ref> [14] </ref>, an effort is made to use bond-graphs for embodiment design by enhancing the representation. A notion that models a spring as a two port device because it has two ends is used.

Reference-contexts: Each approach rapidly descends to the embodiment design problem and addresses design issues that are spatial in nature. Also design specification is given in terms of a particular class of devices e.g. gears. Verification at the behavior, parametric or at the embodiment level is not discussed. Dixon and Welch <ref> [15] </ref> use bond-graphs to generate physical embodiments from initial specifications that are similar to [10]. No type number is given nor the input and output are represented as chunks. The bond graph representation is annotated with notions of vectors, orientation and position information.

Reference-contexts: Considerthe second law of thermodynamics, wherein, U = Q P V , (U is the internal energy, Q is the input energy, P is the pressure (effort variable) and V is the volume (flow integral variable)). This equation is valid for all systems as indicated in <ref> [20] </ref>, wherein, the effort and flow integral variables are replaced by variable from the corresponding energy domains. Finally, why could the bond graph formalism be useful ? First, they are at a convenient level of abstraction with enough semantic content.
