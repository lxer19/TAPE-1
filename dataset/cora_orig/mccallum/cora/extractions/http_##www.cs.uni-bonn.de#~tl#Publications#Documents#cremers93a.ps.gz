Abstract: Computers will probably never achieve the level of human skills in natural language processing, but they can well aid in such actions as searching in a database. The project NALOG NAtural language processing and LOGic programming aims at querying a database in natural language and getting answers in natural language again. As query language and internal representation format, we explore the use of situation schemata which were developed in an attempt to bring together the unification-based frameworks prominent in NL syntax analysis and situation semantics, one of the leading NL semantic theories. We describe an experimental question-answering system based on the Complex-Relational Data Base. Operations of the Complex-Relational Algebra perform directly on situation schemata generated from NL questions. As far as we know, we present the first evaluation strategy for situation schemata directly based on a relational data model.

Reference-contexts: In the case of a question-answering system for elections, this knowledge consists of information about elections, parties, politicians, and, of course, about the results of elections. Such data as it is provided by the german government (e.g., in <ref> [BTW87-3] </ref>) has been compiled into the Complex-Relational Data Model.

Situation semantics ([Barwise & Perry 83]) provides the background for their interpretation whereas unification-based formalisms contribute the representation format complex attribute-value matrices.

Reference-contexts: Such a compiler is decribed in <ref> [Kniesel 88] </ref>. The system has been implemented on Sun Workstations under UNIX using C (CoReDB) and Prolog (Parser/Generator and situation schema interpreter). Tests showed that the system produces the expected answers, but that the answer times are unexpectedly long which again hints at the strong need for integrating advanced optimization techniques.

Reference-contexts: An interpreter for three-valued logic answers queries concerning vague definitions ([Mellouli 91a]). The relational evaluation of situation schemata which is described in detail in the following chapters is based on the knowledge base stored in the Complex-Relational Data Base (CoReDB, <ref> [Lemke & Schfer 90] </ref>). Both evaluation components produce their answers as (a set of) situation schemata which are passed over to the generator in order to create appropriate NL answers. We assume the knowledge base is given and will not discuss topics of knowledge acquisition.

Reference-contexts: The latter is introduced in order to represent vague concepts (VZ standing for vagueness zone) leading us to a three-valued logic. Since vagueness is a second main focus of NALOG described in <ref> [Mellouli 91a] </ref>, we leave it out of consideration in this paper. Depending on the DEFINIENS, we distinguish two kinds of concepts: Primitive concepts represent basic fact relations in the rule base and link relational data to situation schematic notions.

Reference-contexts: Definition is done in terms of situation schemata using a derived format which is described in <ref> [Mellouli 91b] </ref> and can be represented in a relation concept ( DEFINIENDUM, DEFINIENS, DEFINIENS+VZ ) where DEFINIENDUM is a situation schema whose RELation is to be defined and DEFINIENS and DEFINIENS+VZ are the DEFINIENDUMs truth resp. non-falsity definitions.

Reference-contexts: So far, suggestions have been made for a treatment of relative clauses ([Fenstad et al. 87]), locative PPs ([Colban & Fenstad 88]), wh questions ([Vestre & Fenstad 88]) and noun modifiers ([Engelkamp 91]). A variety of extensions is proposed in <ref> [Paredes-Frigolett 92] </ref>. For efficiency reasons, we decided not to introduce an intermediate language for the transformation process. In order to keep the concepts universal, however, it showed up to be necessary to create the CoReDB Elements which can be regarded as a minimal intermediate representation between situation schema and CoReAl.

The interpreter uses a relation-oriented format, i.e. a situation schema consists of a relation with its arguments. An argument is a constant or a variable, to which a SPECifier can be attached and the scope of which is restricted by one or more relations.
