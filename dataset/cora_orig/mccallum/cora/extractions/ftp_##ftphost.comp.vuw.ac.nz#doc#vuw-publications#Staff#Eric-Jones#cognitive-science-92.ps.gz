Title: Communicating Abstract Advice: the Role of Stories

Abstract: People often give advice by telling stories. Stories both recommend a course of action and exemplify general conditions in which that recommendation is appropriate. A computational model of advice taking using stories must address two related problems: determining the story's recommendations and appropriateness conditions, and showing that these obtain in the new situation. In this paper, we present an efficient solution to the second problem based on caching the results of the first. Our proposal has been implemented in brainstormer, a planner that takes abstract advice.

Reference-contexts: A user then presents advice in the form of a representation of proverb, which the advice taker attempts to transform into an answer to the query. Answers must take the form of operational planner data structures that match (ab-ductively unify) with the query <ref> [ Charniak, 1988 ] </ref> . Suppose, for example, that the planner is currently considering whether or not to carry out a preemptive raid against a terrorist organization. It therefore issues a query for information that would allow it to make a principled decision.

Reference-contexts: Discussion and Related Work Taking advice in the form of a story can be viewed as a process of analogical reasoning, or more specifically, exploiting an "analogical hint" <ref> [ Greiner, 1988 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: This paper presents such an account. Our approach is implemented in brainstormer, a planner linked to an advice taker <ref> [ Jones, 1991a; Jones, 1992 ] </ref> . The advice taker elicits advice from a user in the form of a representation of a proverb, and transforms it into an operational planner data structure that help the planner resolve a current problem-solving difficulty. <p> The task of advice taking is to generate this specific recommendation from the initial, generic representation of the proverb. The advice-taking process has three phases. The first involves inferring an operational planner data structure from the proverb that can match the planner's query. As we explain in <ref> [ Jones, 1992 ] </ref> , this transformation requires reasoning with an explicit model of the planning process. In this paper, however, we focus our attention on the latter phases of advice taking, because this is where the impact of highlighting functionally significant features of proverbs' stories is most acutely felt.

Reference-contexts: It follows that stories present a harder problem of inference than other kinds of advice such as lists of instructions, in which these features are explicit. In addition to the usual problems of operationalization <ref> [ Mostow, 1983 ] </ref> , a story-based advice taker must face the problem of working out which features of the story are relevant to the problem at hand. To obtain a better understanding of this problem, we have studied a particularly simple class of naturally-occurring stories: familiar, advice-giving proverbs.

Reference-contexts: A knowledge-intensive approach to analogical inference is central to brainstormer's success. The system infers commonalities between a proverb's story and a planning problem on the basis of explicit representations of the story's functionally significant features. Stuart Russell likewise advocates a knowledge-intensive approach <ref> [ Russell, 1989 ] </ref> . His dbar system relies on knowledge about functional significance encoded as explicit determinations. A determination P Q (pronounced "P determines Q") licenses analogical inference that Q holds for a target, provided that Q also holds for a source that shares properties P with the target.

Reference-contexts: Introduction People often use stories to give advice. Advice in the form of a story frequently seems more convincing than an unadorned list of instructions <ref> [ Schank, 1991 ] </ref> . Why should this be so? While there are probably a number of factors at work, it is important not to overlook the obvious: stories are often more convincing in large part because they are more informative. <p> While this assumption is reasonable for many proverbs, it is less reasonable for arbitrary stories. A story about a given episode can be used to make a variety of very different points on different occasions <ref> [ Schank, 1991 ] </ref> . It is possible, however, that the following extension of brainstormer's approach might be adequate. Stories are usually laden with linguistic cues designed to highlight the aspects of the story that the speaker intends the hearer to focus on.

Reference-contexts: That is, we begin with representations of its story and its abstract point, and then embed the abstract point in the story. Viewing representations as graph structures <ref> [ Sowa, 1984 ] </ref> , we make the assumption that the abstract point can be represented as a subgraph of the story, where possibly some of the nodes in the subgraph are more general than the corresponding nodes in the story.
