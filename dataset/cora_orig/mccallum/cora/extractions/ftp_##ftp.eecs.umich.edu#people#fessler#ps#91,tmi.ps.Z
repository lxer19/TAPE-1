Abstract: This paper describes an object-based approach to the problem of reconstructing three-dimensional descriptions of arterial trees from a few angiographic projections. The method incorporates a priori knowledge of the structure of branching arteries into a natural optimality criterion that encompasses the entire arterial tree. This global approach enables reconstruction from a few noisy projection images. We present an efficient optimization algorithm for object estimation, and demonstrate its performance on simulated, phantom, and in vivo magnetic resonance angiograms.

Reference-contexts: Even if the number of objects is fixed so that K cannot grow without bound, the results will be unsatisfactory due to noise and the "threshold effect" of ML 8 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING, 10 (1):25-39, MAR. 1991 estimation <ref> [44] </ref>, if the SNR is low. Indeed, many methods follow the ML estimation with a post-processing smoothing step. The principal shortcoming of ML estimation is that it ignores our a priori knowledge of arterial smoothness. The nonparametric optimality criterion presented below attempts to capture this knowledge realistically. B.

We have defined an optimality criterion for the object reconstruction problem. This criterion can be used to compare suboptimal algorithms, or minimized to generate an arterial tree estimate.

Reference-contexts: An initial estimate could come from the output of any of the sub-optimal 3-D reconstruction schemes, but we currently use manual entry. A trained operator determines the number of objects, and then enters coarse centerlines using a technique similar to <ref> [52] </ref>. After tracing a coarse piecewise-linear approximation of each object's centerline on one view, the operator traces the centerline in the (e.g.) orthogonal view using auxiliary lines, observing the other views to confirm object correspondence. Since there are multiple views, the correspondence problem that confounds two view reconstruction is alleviated.

Reference-contexts: If the objects were disjoint, and if their projections were overlap free, then the minimization of (12) would decompose into K independent minimizations one for each object. This fact, combined with the sparseness of arterial trees, suggests that the alternating minimization (AM) algorithm <ref> [23, 53] </ref> is appropriate for this problem. Here, we use the AM algorithm on an object by object 7 basis: the parameters of each object are estimated in turn, while holding the other objects fixed, and the procedure is iterated.

Reference-contexts: Graphs such as Figure Appendix C are useful for computing percent stenosis, but morphology is best viewed through an interactive 3-D display with cut-planes. Figure Appendix C shows a shaded surface display of the reconstruction, generated using the simplest aspects of the shading method presented in <ref> [55] </ref>. The results from this data set demonstrate the potential performance of object-based reconstruction, and highlight an important advantage of the parametric approach: despite the low SNR, the estimates are of sub-pixel accuracy.

Reference-contexts: Brute force minimization of (12) would be impractical computationally; one would need to exploit the structure of arterial trees, as done in Section VI. Automating the procedure should be easier in the high-SNR case, as with intra-arterial contrast studies <ref> [58] </ref>. Clinical utility would certainly be improved if true GCs could be estimated. The ability of MR to acquire projections in arbitrary directions should be useful for addressing this problem. Our approach has been to avoid enforcing plausible constraints such as equality of the density of overlapping ellipses.

Reference-contexts: Though such constraints could reduce the degrees of freedom and thereby decrease the estimate variance, they could also increase potential modeling error. Nevertheless, if the SNR is very low, it may be necessary to use even more a priori knowledge. The branching-spline method of Silverman <ref> [59] </ref>, originally applied to agricultural data, may be a one useful approach to enforcing tighter constraints between objects that branch. An open theoretical question is how to best choose the smoothing factor ff.
