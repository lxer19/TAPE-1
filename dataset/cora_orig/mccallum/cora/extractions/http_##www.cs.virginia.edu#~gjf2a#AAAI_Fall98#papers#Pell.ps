Abstract: The next generation of communications satellites may be designed as a fast packet-switched constellation of spacecraft able to withstand substantial bandwidth capacity fluctuation ranging from unstable weather phenomena to intentional jamming of communication. We have designed and partially implemented an architecture for managing satellite telecommunations network resources. Our approach supports advance reservations and dynamic requests, negotiation and fulfil-ment of prioritized Quality of Service (QoS) contracts, graceful degradation in the presence of dynamic tasks and environmental changes, and optimization of geometrically constrained resources. Our integration of planning and execution to address this task uses planning to avoid resource contentions among requested activities and to configure an independently competent execution system. Our system can be used in routine operations or as a simulation-based design tool.

Reference-contexts: QoS requirements have emerged mainly in the telecommunications domain and have come to the forefront in the context of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) communication networks. Major areas of research on intelligent agents in telecommunication applications <ref> (Albayrak 1998) </ref> include network configuration, call admission control, and routing. Hayzelden (Hayzelden & Bigham 1998) describes a heterogeneous multi-agent architecture for ATM networks. The architecture is similar to RAST in that it integrates a deliberative planning layer with a reactive execution layer.

Reference-contexts: Boddy (Boddy & Goldman 1994) addressed many of these issues in generating a scheduler to produce real-time schedules for the BOE-ING 777 aircraft. The CIRCA system (Musliner et al. 1993) also generates plans with real-time execution guarantees. Boddy and Musliner <ref> (Boddy 1996) </ref> describe a constraint-based distributed scheduling process for air traffic control. Each designated region of airspace is managed by a separate resource manager that allocates spatio-temporal windows to pilots requesting the resource.

Reference-contexts: It would be interesting to see whether the advanced reservations managed by RAST could be exploited by these routing mechanisms for performance improvements. Much of the emphasis of QoS resource allocation involves reasoning about real-time cpu, bandwidth, latency, and jitter requirements, often in the presence of geometric constraints. Boddy <ref> (Boddy & Goldman 1994) </ref> addressed many of these issues in generating a scheduler to produce real-time schedules for the BOE-ING 777 aircraft. The CIRCA system (Musliner et al. 1993) also generates plans with real-time execution guarantees.

Reference-contexts: They applied similar ideas to task distribution and data volume management for distributed processing (Musliner & Boddy 1997).

Reference-contexts: Also, their approach does not deal with advanced scheduling based on call reservations; rather, their planning agents watch over the network and plan modifications to it based on observed usage patterns. Similar comments pertain to the ARCHON multi-agent system <ref> (Jennings et al. 1996) </ref>, which was also applied to network monitoring and configuration. One aspect of network configuration that does fall within the present scope of RAST is beam management.

Reference-contexts: Our redesigned plan execution component (Pell et al. 1998b) will support a similar editing capability, based on the work in O-Plan and also in Cypress (Wilkins et al. 1995). Finally, Lockheed's Tactical Planning and Execution System (TPES) <ref> (Mitchell 1997) </ref> is an interesting related system that supports many execution and replanning capabilities with a high level of human interaction. 7 Open Issues and Future Work 7.1 Open Issues There are a number of open issues this domain has brought out.

Reference-contexts: Temporal information in the plan is represented within the general framework of Simple Temporal Constraint networks, as introduced by Dechter, Meiri, and Pearl (Dechter et al. 1991) in a Temporal Database (TDB). Details of the HSTS planner/scheduler and TDB can be found in <ref> (Muscettola 1994) </ref>. 4.1 The Scheduling Process The PS component generates a schedule of calls based on a domain model. The model describes the set of constraints that all the calls have to satisfy. The schedules consist of several parallel timelines, each of which consist of a sequence of tokens.

Reference-contexts: The planner model is described in a domain description language (DDL) <ref> (Muscettola 1995) </ref>, and is represented as part of the planner's TDB. Temporal constraints are specified in DDL by compatibilities. A compatibility consists of a master token and a boolean expression of temporal relations that must hold between the master token and target tokens. An example is shown in Figure 4.

Reference-contexts: planning and execution that have been explored: * plans as coordination routines for multiple agents (including humans). * planners generate tasks networks, which are then ex ecuted by doing the right task at the right time. * plans as programs, which are run by the executive (e.g. planning in CIRCA <ref> (Musliner et al. 1993) </ref> generates a program comprised of test-action pairs). * plans as advice, which the executive uses in running is own goals (e.g. planner produces a navigation map, which exec uses when it is heading to targets). Our integration has aspects of several of these. <p> Boddy (Boddy & Goldman 1994) addressed many of these issues in generating a scheduler to produce real-time schedules for the BOE-ING 777 aircraft. The CIRCA system <ref> (Musliner et al. 1993) </ref> also generates plans with real-time execution guarantees.

Both these approaches could be used to enhance the priority and policy table update mechanisms in RAST, although the advanced call scheduling of RAST is still necessary for a full solution to our problem.
