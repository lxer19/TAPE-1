Abstract: Technical report CS-TR-3239, UMIACS-TR-94-31, ISR-TR-95-9, March, 1994. Abstract One big obstacle to understanding the nature of hierarchical task network (htn) planning has been the lack of a clear theoretical framework. In particular, no one has yet presented a clear and concise htn algorithm that is sound and complete. In this paper, we present a formal syntax and semantics for htn planning. Based on this syntax and semantics, we are able to define an algorithm for htn planning and prove it sound and complete. We also develop several definitions of expressivity for planning languages and prove that htn planning is strictly more expressive than strips-style planning according to those definitions.
