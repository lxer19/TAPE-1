Abstract: The well known "strong pseudoprime test" has its highest probability of error ( 1=4) when the numbers being tested are certain Carmichael numbers with 3 prime factors. We present a non-rigorous plausibility argument that the count C 3 (x) of 3-factor Carmichaels up to x, is asymptotically C 3 (x) ~ Kx 1=3 (ln x) 3 where K 478 110 is an absolute constant given by The 3-factor Carmichaels which cause error probability ~ 1=4 in the strong pseudoprime test also should obey a law of the same form, but with a different constant K 0 383 81, defined by the same formula as K, except that in the sum, a, b, and c are now also required to be odd. The only other numbers which can cause a probability of error &gt; 1=8 in the strong pseudoprime test are certain numbers with only 2 prime factors and certain prime powers. However if these cases are somehow known to apply, then we show how to improve the strong pseudoprime test so that its probability of error on N is O(1= p
