Abstract: In this paper the feasibility of self-calibration in the presence of varying internal camera parameters is under investigation. A self-calibration method is presented which efficiently deals with all kinds of constraints on the internal camera parameters. Within this framework a practical method is proposed which can retrieve metric reconstruction from image sequences obtained with uncalibrated zooming/focusing cameras. The feasibility of the approach is illustrated on real and synthetic examples.

Reference-contexts: The complete procedure for metric 3D reconstruction is summarized here. 1. Corners are matched between the different images of the sequence and the projective camera matrices P k are robustly estimated from them. A more detailed explanation of this approach can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. 2. Self-Calibration (a) First the focal lengths f k are estimated using the linear algorithm (assuming that there is no skew and that the principal point is in the middle of the image).

Reference-contexts: The epipolar geometry is used to obtain a pairwise image rectification where all epipolar lines lay along the image scan lines. Dense correspon dence matches are then computed along each scan line using hierarchical block-matching and dy namic programming <ref> [2] </ref>. 4.

Reference-contexts: Therefore a tradeoff can be made and by assuming these parameters to be known, one can allow (some of) the other parameters to vary throughout the image sequence. Since it became clear that projective reconstructions could be obtained from image sequences alone <ref> [3, 5] </ref>, researchers tried to find ways to upgrade these reconstructions to metric (i.e. Euclidean but unknown scale). Many methods where developed which assumed constant internal camera parameters [4, 15, 19, 7, 18, 13, 11, 12, 6]. <p> It is a well-known result that from image correspondences alone the camera projection matrices and the reconstruction of the scene points can be retrieved up to a projective transformation <ref> [3, 5] </ref>. Note that without additional constraints nothing more can be achieved. This can be seen from the following equation. m = PM = (PT 1 )(TM ) = P 0 M 0 with T an arbitrary projective transformation.

Reference-contexts: So far not much work has been done on varying internal camera parameters.

Reference-contexts: This can be derived from the following theorem: Theorem The class of transformations which preserves the absence of skew is the group of similarity trans formations. A proof of this theorem can be found in <ref> [14] </ref>. <p> Another experiment was carried out to evaluate the performance of the algorithm for different sequence length. The longer the sequence the better the results, especially when few constraints are used. More details can be found in <ref> [14] </ref>. 5.2 Outdoor Sequence 1 The first sequence showing part of an old castle was filmed with a fixed zoom/focus. It is therefore a good test for the algorithms presented in this paper to check if they indeed return constant intrinsic parameters for this sequence.
