Abstract: 113 articles about neural network learning algorithms published in 1993 and 1994 are examined for the amount of experimental evaluation they contain. Every third of them does employ not even a single realistic or real learning problem. Only 6% of all articles present results for more than one problem using real world data. Furthermore, one third of all articles does not present any quantitative comparison with a previously known algorithm. These results indicate that the quality of research in the area of neural network learning algorithms needs improvement. The publication standards should be raised and easily accessible collections of example problems be built. Contents

Reference-contexts: Motivated by this impression, I decided to investigate this hypothesis by studying the current research practice empirically. In a recent study of experimental evaluation in computer science publications, the journal Neural Computation produced quite good results, far above average <ref> [1] </ref>. However, the only measure used in that work was the fraction of article space devoted to the evaluation and the articles considered were not only those about learning algorithms. The approach taken in the present study is more concrete at assessing the quality of an evaluation. <p> Experimental evaluation may be a lot of work, but it needs to be done. 6. I believe that your data contains many errors. Probably there is a considerable number of errors in my data. See <ref> [1] </ref> for a discussion and estimation of the precision to be expected of the observations made; that discussion should also apply to the present study.
