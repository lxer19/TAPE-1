Title: Bayesian Models of Human Sentence Processing  
Author: Srini Narayanan Daniel Jurafsky 
Address: Boulder  
Affiliation: University of California, Berkeley. University of Colorado,  
Abstract: Human language processing relies on many kinds of linguistic knowledge, and is sensitive to their frequency, including lexical frequencies (Tyler, 1984; Salasoo & Pisoni, 1985; Marslen-Wilson, 1990; Zwitserlood, 1989; Simpson & Burgess, 1985), idiom frequencies (d'Arcais, 1993), phonological neighborhood frequencies (Luce, Pisoni, & Goldfinger, 1990), subcategorization frequencies (Trueswell, Tanenhaus, & Kello, 1993), and thematic role frequencies (Trueswell, Tanenhaus, & Gar-nsey, 1994; Garnsey, Pearlmutter, Myers, & Lotocky, 1997). But while we know that each of these knowledge sources must be probabilistic, we know very little about exactly how these probabilistic knowledge sources are combined. This paper proposes the use of Bayesian decision trees in modeling the probabilistic, evidential nature of human sentence processing. Our method reifies conditional independence assertions implicit in sign-based linguistic theories and describes interactions among features without requiring additional assumptions about modularity. We show that our Bayesian approach successfully models psycholinguistic results on evidence combination in human lexical, idiomatic, and syntactic/semantic processing.

Reference-contexts: of the use of these different knowledge sources is not yet fully understood, it is clear that the processing of this knowledge is sensitive to frequency, from lexical frequencies (Tyler, 1984; Salasoo & Pisoni, 1985; Marslen-Wilson, 1990; Zwitserlood, 1989; Simpson & Burgess, 1985), idiom frequencies (d'Arcais, 1993), phonological neighborhood frequencies <ref> (Luce et al., 1990) </ref>, subcategorization frequencies (Trueswell et al., 1993), and thematic role frequencies (Trueswell et al., 1994; Gar-nsey et al., 1997). Probabilistic versions of linguistic knowledge are also becoming common in linguistics (Resnik, 1993, 1992; Jurafsky, 1996).

Reference-contexts: So in the case when only the subject has been input (the horse in the examples in Figure 6) the thematic influence is minimal and the MV RR ratio is basically a result of the syntactic support. The data in Figure 6 was taken from <ref> (MacDonald, 1993) </ref> and from (Marcus et al., 1993) (for found).

Reference-contexts: Each of these constructions is associated with a prior probability, which can be computed from relative frequencies from corpora or norming studies. 2 For example, in order to compute the probability of the simplified Stochastic Context-Free Grammar (SCFG) rule in (1), we can use the Penn Treebank <ref> (Marcus et al., 1993) </ref> to get a frequency for all NPs (52,627), and then for those NP's which consist of a Det and an N (33,108). The conditional probability is then 33,108/52,627=.63. <p> So in the case when only the subject has been input (the horse in the examples in Figure 6) the thematic influence is minimal and the MV RR ratio is basically a result of the syntactic support.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, in computing the conjunctive impact of the lexical/thematic and syntactic support to compute M V and RR , we use the well studied NOISY-AND model (Pearl, 1988) 6 For exact technical details, including an automatic network construction technique, refer to <ref> (Narayanan, 1998) </ref> tactic support for a specific construction. for combining conjunctive sources where it is assumed that whatever inhibits a specific source (syntactic) from indicating support for a construction, is independent of mechanisms that inhibit other sources (lexical) from indicating support for the same construction.

Reference-contexts: The crucial insight of our Belief net model is to view specific constructions as values of latent variables that render top-down ( e + ) and bottom-up evidence ( e ) conditionally independent (d-separate them <ref> (Pearl, 1988) </ref>). Thus syntactic, lexical, argument structure, and other contextual information acts as prior or causal support for a construction/interpretation, while bottom-up phonological or graphological and other perceptual information acts as likelihood, evidential, or diagnostic support. Figure 1 shows a computational realization of this idea. <p> In other words, inter-source dependencies are explicitly captured by specific constructions.

Reference-contexts: The first idea is that multiple sources of linguistic knowledge, conceptual and perceptual, interact in access and disambiguation. This idea is manifest in the psychological literature on lexical access and sentence processing, as well as in PDP and dynamical systems models of language processing <ref> (Tabor, Juliano, & Tanenhaus, 1997) </ref>. The second idea is that linguistic knowledge is highly structured, and hierarchically organized (exemplified by syntactic and argument-structure knowledge). Using probabilistic nets allows us to compute the joint distribution of multiple correlated features by using structural relationships to minimize the number of inter-feature interactions.

Reference-contexts: Thematic probabilities can be computed by normalizing verb bias norms, for example from Garnsey et al. (1997). Table 1 shows some lexical probabilities, for the verb examine, including morphological, subcategorization, and thematic probabilities. The thematic probabilities were computed by using psychological norming studies <ref> (Trueswell et al., 1994) </ref> to quantify the degree of fit between a specific filler (such as witness) to a specific argument slot (agent or theme) given a predicate verb (examined). This information can also be obtained from a semantic database (like WordNet) as was done by Resnik (Resnik, 1993). <p> Information on thematic fit, was culled from Typicality ratings used in the psychological study by <ref> (Trueswell et al., 1994) </ref>. As illustrated in Figure 7 after processing the input phrase The witness examined,the RR interpretation is less preferred but not pruned. <p> Thus our model garden-paths on the example The horse raced past the barn fell but will not garden path on the example The horse carried past the barn fell or on the example The horse found past the barn fell. Our model also explains the correlations that <ref> (Trueswell et al., 1994) </ref> found between thematic fit and processing difficulty. Furthermore we are able to explain garden-pathing as a graded effect, where processing difficulty and chance of garden pathing depends on how strongly the input favors a given interpretation.
