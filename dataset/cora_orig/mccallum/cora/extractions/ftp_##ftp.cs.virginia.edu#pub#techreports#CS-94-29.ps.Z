Reference-contexts: The literature contains several proposals for both discrete traffic specifications [7, 9], which describe traffic as a sequence of packet arrivals with nonzero length, and continuous traffic specifications <ref> [4, 14] </ref>, where traffic is regarded as a continuous stream of data. Since actual network traffic is discrete in nature, discrete traffic specifications enable a more precise description of network traffic. <p> However, at most one delay bound can be associated with each priority level, thus, limiting the flexibility of SP-schedulers for providing different delay bounds to connections. Using a fluid flow traffic specification, necessary and sufficient schedulability conditions for SP-schedulers are presented in <ref> [4] </ref>. However, the conditions are not exact for more realistic discrete traffic scenarios. For a particular discrete traffic specification [7], Zhang and Ferrari [20], and Zhang [19] have derived several sufficient schedulability conditions. The remainder of this study is structured as follows. <p> The relation between actual and maximum traffic is such that for all times t &gt; 0 and for all t 0, A j is bounded by A fl j in the following way <ref> [2, 4] </ref>: A j [t; t + t ] A fl 2 We use [a,b] to denote the set of all x with a x b, (a,b] to denote the set of all x with a &lt; x b, [a,b) to denote the set of all x with a x &lt; <p> The counter is not incremented if its value reaches b j s j . The given continuous specification is equivalent to the specification in <ref> [4] </ref> and results in the following rate-controlling function: ~ A fl s j (3) Note that the rate-controlling functions in (2) and (3) satisfy ^ A fl j (t) ~ A fl j (t) is a rate-controlling function for ^ A fl j (t). <p> We say that a packet scheduler is stable if all its busy periods are finite. Note that stability of 7 a packet scheduler also implies that the delays in the scheduler queue are finite. The condition for stability of a work-conserving packet schedulers is given by <ref> [4] </ref>: lim P N j (t) &lt; 1 (5) For discrete traffic specifications, we allow equality in (5). 4 Schedulability Conditions The maximum tolerable delay 3 of any packet from connection j in the packet scheduler of a network switch is referred to as the delay bound and denoted by d <p> by D max p : p = max 1 d p &lt; min &lt; t j t + t j2C p j (t) + q=1 j2C q j (t + t ) s fl r&gt;p 9 ; = (13) This notation is similar to the one used by Cruz in <ref> [4] </ref> for sufficient schedulability conditions that apply to continuous traffic specifications. However, the sufficient conditions in [4] can be extended to 11 also consider discrete traffic specifications. Then, the results in [4] provide the following expression for the maximum delay D max D p max 1 &lt; max &lt; t j <p> t + t j2C p j (t) + q=1 j2C q j (t + t ) s fl r&gt;p 9 ; = (13) This notation is similar to the one used by Cruz in <ref> [4] </ref> for sufficient schedulability conditions that apply to continuous traffic specifications. However, the sufficient conditions in [4] can be extended to 11 also consider discrete traffic specifications. Then, the results in [4] provide the following expression for the maximum delay D max D p max 1 &lt; max &lt; t j t + t j2C p j (t) + q=1 j2C q j (t + t ) <p> ) s fl r&gt;p 9 ; = (13) This notation is similar to the one used by Cruz in <ref> [4] </ref> for sufficient schedulability conditions that apply to continuous traffic specifications. However, the sufficient conditions in [4] can be extended to 11 also consider discrete traffic specifications. Then, the results in [4] provide the following expression for the maximum delay D max D p max 1 &lt; max &lt; t j t + t j2C p j (t) + q=1 j2C q j (t + t ) s fl r&gt;p 9 ; = (14) Obviously, all maximum delays that satisfy the condition <p> Thus, for P p j=1 s j =T j &lt; 1, the connections are schedulable if d p is set to: d p j=1 r&gt;p 1 j=1 T j Since for this traffic specification, equations (13) and (14) coincide, the above conditions are equivalent with the condition given in <ref> [4] </ref>. Now we turn to Theorem 3. With the continuous traffic specification, the conditions for priority p in Theorem 3 are clearly satisfied for all t d p if they are satisfied for t = d p .

Reference-contexts: In the presence of admission control and policing, which limit the number of connections and the traffic on the connections, many packet scheduling disciplines can provide bounds on multiplexing delays <ref> [6] </ref>; however, most scheduling disciplines are not suited for use in a network with bounded delay services. As an example, with FCFS scheduling a bound on the multiplexing delay of a packet is given by the maximum backlog of untransmitted packets.

We derive exact schedulability conditions for both scheduling disciplines. 1 Our conditions apply to most traffic specifications, both continuous and discrete, considered in the literature. <p> With EDF scheduling, a switch can support a variable set of delay bounds for a large number of connections. However, EDF requires that queued packets be sorted according to their deadlines. Ferrari and Verma presented sufficient schedulability conditions for EDF scheduling for a bounded delay service in <ref> [7] </ref>. Using a traffic specification which neglects the burstiness of network traffic, Zheng and Shin have derived necessary and sufficient schedulability conditions [21]. A Static-Priority (SP) scheduler provides multiple priority levels, and each connection is assigned to one priority level. <p> Using a fluid flow traffic specification, necessary and sufficient schedulability conditions for SP-schedulers are presented in [4].

The traffic specification uses three parameters to characterize the traffic from a connection j: the period T j , the burst size b j , and the maximum transmission time of a packet s j .
