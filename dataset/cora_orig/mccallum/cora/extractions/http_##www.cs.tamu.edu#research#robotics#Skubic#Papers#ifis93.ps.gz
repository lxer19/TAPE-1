Title: Design of a Two-Level Fuzzy Controller for a Reactive Miniature Mobile Robot

Abstract: This paper describes the design and implementation of the fuzzy control system for a small, reactive mobile robot which operates in an unknown, unpredictable, and dynamic environment. A modular, two-level fuzzy controller is used for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and target tracking. The fuzzy controller provides the mechanism for fusing noisy sensor data from multiple sensors which may present conflicting information. Competing behaviors of target tracking and obstacle avoidance are combined in a way that serves both functions, thereby resulting in an emergent intelligent behavior of the robot controller. The efficiency of the two-level fuzzy controller is demonstrated by implementing the system on a small mobile robot with two onboard processors and limited memory (2K per processor).

Reference-contexts: The circular defuzzification algorithm was designed to correct this problem. The algorithm handles the wraparound caused by the circular nature of the directions. A weighted average is then performed on this one area to yield the final control direction. More details can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. The efficiency of the two-level fuzzy controller comes in part from limiting the number of input and output variables used by the FIU. Limiting the inputs and outputs effectively reduces the number of rules required, which reduces the complexity, execution time, and memory requirements.

Reference-contexts: If a discrete method were used, the performance would be even more sensitive to the lighting conditions. V Conclusions The fuzzy control strategy used in the FuzzBug is not intended to supersede the fuzzy behaviorist approaches described in <ref> [6, 7] </ref> but rather to be used in conjunction with them. That is, sensors and behaviors that have a natural coupling could be combined to form a higher level (more intelligent) behavior. These higher-level be haviors could then be used within the fuzzy behaviorist architectures.
