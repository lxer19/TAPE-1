Abstract: Why are grown scientists, let alone the general public, afraid that Artificial Intelligences (or "AIs") are going to take over the world, obsoleting humans? Why are people worried about the ethics of unplugging their computers, or whether AI spells the end of social order through the death of free will? In this paper we argue that these are manifestations of over-identification with AI, as well as general confusion over ethical standards. Any advances in AI technology will require relatively little change in our ethical views towards ourselves and artifacts, and where change might be useful, it is already required. In these cases, empirical experience of the general public with AI technology will actually be a useful catalyst.

Reference-contexts: The authors, gravitating towards the behaviour based AI community, would argue strongly that our intelligence, being body based, parallel, and rooted in reflexes and imitative learning of culture, has much more to do with animal intelligence than with 6 the mathematically based logics of computer science (see further <ref> [Brooks 91] </ref>). Classically humanity has distanced itself from the rest of nature using precisely such talents as mathematics and language. Hopefully having more diverse counter-examples of such paradigms of humanity will give us a better sense of self, and thus a better basis for a progressive ethical structure.

Reference-contexts: An obsession with the results of action rather the actions themselves is not something that AI needs to address. It is a fault of our culture and we should not fear to tackle it <ref> [Burns 69] </ref>. 4 Ethics and AI Our argument here is not that there are no ethical considerations to creating and using AI technology. Rather, we are arguing that the nature of our ethical obligations are often misconstrued.

Reference-contexts: In the history of philosophy, many have held that the primary or even sole purpose of ethics is to maintain a functional degree of social homogeneity, or to protect the social organism (for example <ref> [Hobbes 47] </ref>). To this extent, the details of an ethical system might be seen as somewhat arbitrary. Certainly the ethics of a culture adapts in many ways according to the caprice of the environment. One consequence of this is that a self-regulatory nature is an important aspect of ethical behaviour.
Reference: [Hume 48] <author> David Hume. </author> <title> Essay Concerning Human Understanding. </title> <journal> London, </journal> <volume> 1748. </volume>
Reference-contexts: Certainly from the individual perspective, free will will continue to be our qualitative experience. Interestingly, Hume had a powerful argument to the effect that deterministic operation is necessary to our idea of responsibility <ref> [Hume 48] </ref>. An act without determination is an act without cause and this is a random event. Random events with no cause are no basis for attributions of responsibility. Whilst we would not like to here advocate the accompanying view of causality and metaphysics, this raises an important point.

Reference-contexts: If we come to understand our more complicated relationships with friends, state and religion in terms of transference from familial relationships (as might be suggested by <ref> [Lakoff & Johnson 80] </ref>) then we might quite literally feel that actions that benefit them are in our own best interest. 3 Thus transferance and identification are two manifestations of our underlying empathetic tendencies. Together, they may provide important elements of our social and ethical structures.

Reference-contexts: Together, they may provide important elements of our social and ethical structures. Other potential elements are our tendency to be extremely over-optimistic in our estimates of our own levels of control and likelihoods for success, even in situations with which we have experience <ref> [Taylor & Brown 88] </ref>. These biases can contribute to our willingness to participate in situations like war and capitalism, which can have lower probable return for some individuals than for their society as a whole.

Reference-contexts: Because computers display behaviours which we have previously seen only in humans, such as language and mathematics, we can initially be quickly moved to unjustified empathy <ref> [Weizenbaum 66] </ref>.
