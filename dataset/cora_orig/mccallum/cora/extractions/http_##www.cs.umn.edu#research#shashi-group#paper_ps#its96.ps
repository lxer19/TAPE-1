Abstract: This project focuses on route planning algorithms for Advanced Driver Information Systems (ADIS), which are also known as Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS). Route planning has been approached by graph-theoretic algorithms for all-pair (transitive closure) and singlesource (partial transitive) path computations. These algorithms compute many more paths beyond the single-pair path that is of interest to ATIS, and hence may not be satisfactory for ATIS due to the dynamic nature of edge costs (travel-time). For single-pair path computation, we explore specialized algorithms such as A*, which are designed to reduce irrelevant computation and to quickly discover the shortest paths. Our cost models and performance studies show that single-pair algorithms can outperform traditional algorithms in many situations.
