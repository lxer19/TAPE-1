Abstract: The paper also described how conservative methods can be implemented to handle dynamic communication topologies, in a restricted way. Previous studies of conservative implementations have used a static communication topology. If the communication pattern in the model varies dynamically, this assumption leads to sub-optimal performance. We describe language constructs to ensure that topological changes are made consistently by the run-time system. Lastly, the paper describes how certain types of lookahead behavior can be extracted transparently by the simulation system. It also introduces language constructs that can be used by a programmer to specify the lookahead behavior of a specific object. The three algorithms that were studied include the null message algorithm, the conditional event algorithm, and a new algorithm that combines the preceding approaches. Maisie models were developed for standard queuing network benchmarks. Various configurations of the model were executed using the three different algorithms. The implementations were optimized to exploit the lookahead properties of the models. The benchmarks were used to compare the performance of the three algorithms and were also used to evaluate the effect of variations in lookahead characteristics on the performance of the algorithms.
