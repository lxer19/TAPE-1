Abstract: Maximizing overall performance in multicomputers requires matching application communication characteristics with a suitable routing scheme. However, since the communication demands of emerging applications vary significantly, it is hard for a single routing algorithm to perform well under all workloads. In order to study the complex dependencies between routing policies and communication workloads, we have performed a set of multi-factor experiments to better characterize routing performance. These experiments show that in addition to adaptivity, the selection functions used to order the candidate links greatly affect network performance under various traffic patterns. By supporting flexible routing, the network can tune its routing policies to application communication characteristics in order to improve performance.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we focus on how routing policies impact network performance as the communication pattern is varied. Specifically, we classify different routing algorithms in terms of their adaptivity and the selection function <ref> [3] </ref> used to determine the order in which candidate links are considered. Through extensive multi-factor experiments, we investigate how selection functions and the amount of routing adaptivity combine with the traffic pattern to determine how well links are utilized and hence, how well the network performs. <p> In addition, adaptive algorithms add to the complexity of both the hardware which implements the scheme and the software which must handle the possibility of out-of-order arrivals [10]. Each algorithm invokes a selection function <ref> [3] </ref> which selects and orders candidate links. Network performance is greatly influenced by the interaction of this function with the communication workload. Selection functions of oblivious algorithms deterministically select a single candidate link independent of the current network conditions.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the model assumes that the host is an ideal sink with large buffer capacity. This abstract model allows the basic interaction between selection functions and communication workloads to be studied. Experiments were also done on a cycle level simulation model of SPIDER <ref> [14] </ref> and showed similar trends in performance. The destination node patterns we examine include node uniform traffic, as well as patterns found in scientific computations such as the matrix-transpose, bit-complement, and bit-reversal permutations. Table 1 summarizes each of these destination distributions.

Applying these results to improve routing performance can easily be done for systems such as HARTS [19], the nCube-3 [16], and Hnet <ref> [15] </ref> which support multiple routing policies. For systems which only support a single routing policy, these results can be used to influence how the operating system maps the tasks onto multicomputer nodes, in effect, tailoring the communication workload to the routing algorithm.
