Abstract: The paper explores a biologically inspired definition of intelligence. Intelligence is related to whether behavior of a system contributes to its self-maintenance. Behavior becomes more intelligent (or copes with more ecological pressures) when it is capable to create and use representations. The notion of representation should not be restricted to formal expressions with a truth-theoretic semantics. The dynamics at various levels of intelligent systems plays an essential role in forming representations. An example is given how behavioral diversity spontaneously emerges in a globally coupled net work of agents.
