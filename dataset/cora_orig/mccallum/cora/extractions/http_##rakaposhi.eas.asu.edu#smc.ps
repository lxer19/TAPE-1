Levesque, </author> <title> ``An essential hybrid reasoning system: Knowledge and symbol level accounts,'' </title> <booktitle> in Proceedings of Ninth Intl. Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, </booktitle> <month> August </month> <year> 1985. </year> <title> 14 Of course, the usual tradeoff holds between the delay of commitment and the amount of computation needed to check the consistency of the plan. Thus, in the example of the fixturing specialist, to avoid extensive geometric simulation, a single total-ordering of the setups is ultimately chosen for detailed fixture planning. </title>
Reference-contexts: For example, Miller and Schubert [20] describe a reasoning system that interfaces a general purpose theorem prover with a set of specialists to accelerate it. Here, typically the general purpose reasoner already has a complete model of the reasoning carried out by the specialists. Brachman et. al. <ref> [1] </ref> describe a reasoning system called krypton which integrates a terminological and an assertional reasoning module by modifying the semantics of the unification operation. However, very little work along these lines has been done in planning.
