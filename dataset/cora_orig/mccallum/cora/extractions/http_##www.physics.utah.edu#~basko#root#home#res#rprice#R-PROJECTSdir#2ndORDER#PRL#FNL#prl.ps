Abstract: We study the head-on collision of two equal-mass momentarily stationary black holes, using black hole perturbation theory up to second order. Compared to first-order results, this significantly improves agreement with numerically computed waveforms and energy. Much more important, second-order results correctly indicate the range of validity of perturbation theory. This use of second-order, to provide "error bars," makes perturbation theory a viable tool for providing benchmarks for numerical relativity in more generic collisions and, in some range of collision parameters, for supplying waveform templates for gravitational wave detection.

Reference-contexts: A key missing element in perturbative close-approximation calculations is that one cannot tell a priori over what range it is valid. (How close is "close enough"?) The main point of this article is to show that this missing element is provided by second-order perturbation theory, which has recently been developed <ref> [6] </ref>, largely for this purpose. A higher-order calculation is characterized by a number of interesting technical issues (such as gauge choices of different order), and by considerable complexity.

Reference-contexts: Here we want only briefly to describe the nature of the computation, and to argue the importance of the first results.

This is done for definiteness in the description, and because this is the case which can most thoroughly be compared with the numerical results.
