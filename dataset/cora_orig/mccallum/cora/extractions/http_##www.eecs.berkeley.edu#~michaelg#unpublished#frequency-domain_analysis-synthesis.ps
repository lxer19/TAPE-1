Reference-contexts: In general, analysis produces a parametric representation of the signal which can be inverted in the synthesis process; in the STFT case, for instance, an overlap-add inverse Fourier transform synthesis can be used to regenerate the original signal <ref> [1] </ref>. For such an analysis-based synthesis to be musically useful, it is necessary that the intermediate parametric representation, namely the analysis output, be malleable; modifications such as time-scale changes, pitch shifts, and timbral interpolation must be readily achievable in the parametric domain.

NOISE In the frequency-domain analysis-synthesis system, the output signal constructed using the sinusoidal model parameters tends to sound artificial. This is a common problem in analysis-based and other synthesizers.

Reference-contexts: In the modern age, due to the maturation of high-speed digital signal processing devices and algorithms, electronic musical instruments are readily available. The standard market synthesizers typically use a frequency modulation method developed by Chowning <ref> [3] </ref>. A sampler, on the other hand, repeats stored sounds from memory upon user command; these sounds can typically be pitch-shifted or time-scaled according to user input.

Reference-contexts: The local analysis can be readily done in the time domain <ref> [6] </ref> or in the frequency domain using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) [14, 21, 22, 23].

The output of the FFT corresponds to a short-time spectrum for a specific analysis frame. <p> These functions of time are typically referred to as tracks or contours. The specifics of this algorithm will not be considered here, although it is noted that a variety of approaches exist <ref> [6, 14, 22, 23] </ref>. For instance, a hidden Markov model (HMM) technique has recently been developed; given the short-time spectra, it determines the most probable tracks for the parameters using a smoothness measure to quantify the likelihood of a given track [4]. <p> In general, harmonicity is not imposed on the partials; then, the result of the analysis process is a set of three parameters for each partial in each analysis frame.

Reference-contexts: These methods require additional memory or additional computation, respectively; the computational drawback of interpolation is more serious given the goal of real-time synthesis, though, so the stored version of B (!) should be oversampled enough to keep frequency roundoff errors below the perceptual threshold <ref> [7] </ref>. <p> For more on this approximation, see <ref> [7] </ref>. window, and (c) the overall synthesis window. thus accounting for the opposite signs of the phases in equation 6 and thereby insuring that the subsequent inverse FFT produces a real time-domain signal.

An approach for handling this stochastic process in the frequency-domain synthesizer is discussed in detail in <ref> [8] </ref>; this method involves parameterizing the residual in terms of the energy in a set of frequency bands derived from psychoacoustic experiments, and has proven useful in improving the synthesis realism. 7.

Reference-contexts: This windowing process extracts a weighted length-N sequence from the input data stream; input values outside the window are not included in that specific analysis frame <ref> [11] </ref>. However, those values are captured by subsequent applications of the analysis window to later portions of the input signal. <p> Of course, some windows are better approximated by this method than others. For instance, the Hanning window transform has lower sidelobes than the transform of a rectangular window, and is therefore more accurately rep resented by its main spectral lobe alone <ref> [11, 16] </ref>. 6 For a typical N value of 512 and a sampling rate of f s = 44:1 kHz, the frequency bins are spaced by f s =N = 44100=512 86 Hz. A higher frequency resolution is achieved in the following way. <p> Note that b [n] can be any time-domain window whose spectrum B (!) has low sidelobes and a concentrated main lobe; a variety of reasonably appropriate windows exists <ref> [11, 16] </ref>. In the implementation, of course, the overlap-add is simply carried out with this resultant window instead of using this two-step process. The reason that a triangular window is desired for the overlap-add is that it provides linear interpolation of the signal amplitude from one frame to the next.

Thus, control of the synthesizer is fundamentally feasible.

Reference-contexts: TIME-DOMAIN SYNTHESIS In time-domain additive synthesis, the signal is constructed in accordance with the signal model expressed in equations 1 and 2. As shown in figure 4, the parameter tracks are used to control a bank of sinusoidal oscillators whose outputs are summed to produce the synthesis output <ref> [15, 19] </ref>. This complies with the signal model in that each of the oscillators produces a specific partial; the sum of the oscillator outputs then corresponds to the deterministic component d (t).

Another example of a source-filter model is Rodet's format-wave-function synthesis filters, wherein each vocal formant or resonance is controlled by an independent filter <ref> [20] </ref>. These various modeling approaches generally overlap when considered within the context that a physical system can often be reasonably replaced by an equivalent filter, and that filter designs are frequently motivated by measured physical responses.

One reason for this performance advantage is that the spectral accumulation does not add the full N - point transform B (! ! q ) into the spectrum for each partial; it only uses the bin values that represent the main lobe of the spectrum.
