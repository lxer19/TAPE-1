Title: Optimal Line Bipartitions of Point Sets  
Author: Olivier Devillers Matthew J. Katz 
Abstract: Let S be a set of n points in the plane. We study the following problem: Partition S by a line into two subsets S a and S b such that maxff (S a ); f (S b )g is minimal, where f is any monotone function defined over 2 S . We first present a solution to the case where the points in S are the vertices of some convex polygon and apply it to some common cases | f (S 0 ) is the perimeter, area, or width of the convex hull of S 0 S | to obtain linear solutions (or O(n log n) solutions if the convex hull of S is not given) to the corresponding problems. This solution is based on an efficient procedure for finding a minimal entry in matrices of some special type, which we believe is of independent interest. For the general case we present a linear space solution which is in some sense output sensitive. It yields solutions to the perimeter and area cases that are never slower and often faster than the best previous solutions.

Thus we obtain an alternative solution, with the same bounds, to the one given by Asano et al. <ref> [2] </ref> for the problem of computing an optimal bipartition of S as above with respect to the diameter function.

Reference-contexts: After the convex hull has been updated, it is easy to update f . The convex hull can be maintained dynamically in O (log 2 n) time [14, 15] or in randomized O (log n) time <ref> [4] </ref> per operation. Both methods allow the maintenance of the perimeter and the area in logarithmic time, and also the common tangents of the two convex polygons can be computed in logarithmic time. We thus obtain the second theorem stated in the Introduction.

Reference-contexts: Both operations are straightforward and the area and perimeter can be easily updated, since the transformation consists of adding or removing a single triangle to P i;j . The maintenance of the width requires some additional effort. The width is defined by antipodal pairs <ref> [15] </ref>, thus to update the width it is enough to examine the new antipodal pairs. <p> After the convex hull has been updated, it is easy to update f .
