Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Digital images are proving to be a useful resource in K-12 education; astronomy images support scientific discovery and rediscovery <ref> [1] </ref>, and mathematics learning is enriched by using special software to apply mathematical operations to images. Today, the global electronic network makes available a rich variety of digital images, and the wealth of this material is expanding rapidly.

Reference-contexts: Today, the global electronic network makes available a rich variety of digital images, and the wealth of this material is expanding rapidly. However, not only are there problems of disorganization and information overload <ref> [2] </ref>, but technological bottlenecks remain in the path to effective usage of these resources. Access to networked image resources is generally not integrated with either professional or educational applications. Special programs such as FTP, GOPHER, or NCSA Mosaic must be used to transfer images.

Reference-contexts: The project has also explored aspects of cooperative learn-ing in which students work together to manipulate a visual object such as a color specification or a curve. Additional information about the METIP project is given in <ref> [3] </ref>. In most of the METIP activities, students have used either of two kinds of images: (1) "canned images" provided in the METIP software distribution, or (2) personal images taken with a portable digital camera or scanned by the students with a scanner.

Reference-contexts: Browsing can be made more effective and rewarding through performance improvements; however, performance is probably less critical in browsing than it is in highly-structured learning activities. 3.2. Scientific Observation Projects such as CoVis (headed at Northwestern University <ref> [4] </ref>) is helping students, on an experimental ba sis, to use up-to-date images of weather patterns to learn about science with the Internet. A more common methodology is to use local images or images recently downloaded for experiments that might last an hour or so.

Reference-contexts: In the future, storing of the images locally might not so often be necessary. 3.4. Computations on Local Images Locally stored images are sufficient to support many aspects of image processing including the application of arithmetic operations to image enhancement as shown in Figure 1 (see <ref> [5] </ref> for more details). Any kind of image stored remotely can, of course, be made into a local image by downloading it. However, ready access to a network is necessary for such downloading, and there is sometimes extra value in non-local images. 4.

Reference-contexts: A Definition of Authenticity School-based education has often been criticized for being removed from reality and irrelevant to the real world. (For example, see <ref> [6] </ref>.) Consequently, it is worth thinking about the issue of authenticity in educational activities and materials. authentic: : : 2. that is in fact as repre sented; genuine; real [an authentic antique]: : : - Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language Generally, by "authentic" we mean one of the

Reference-contexts: The issue of timed interactions with hypertexts that contain programs has been explored by Stotts and Fu-ruta in ffTrellis <ref> [7] </ref>. However, additional research is needed to provide hyperprogram designers with a convenient means to specify a document's behavior under widely varying network traffic conditions. 7.2. Adaptation In order to make a resource fit a particular purpose, it may need to be modified.
