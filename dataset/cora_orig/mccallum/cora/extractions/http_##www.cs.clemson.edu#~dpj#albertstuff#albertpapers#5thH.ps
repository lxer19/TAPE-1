Reference-contexts: Thus, the dimension obtained by a particular two-generator construction of an alternative algebra should remain unchanged when the identities are replaced by the associative law. Hentzel and Jacobs used an early prototype of Albert to study the identities [x; y] and (xx)(xx) ((xx)x)x. By a result of A.A. Albert <ref> [1] </ref>, this variety of algebras is power associative when the field has characteristic &gt; 5. The results of this early experiment are reported by Hentzel and Jacobs [7], and are consistent with those obtained with our present system.

Reference-contexts: The purpose of this paper is to describe an initial attempt at building a specialized, but useful, system for doing nonassociative algebra. We should remark that the application of computers to nonassociative algebra is not new. An example of very early work is by Kleinfeld [10], and two books <ref> [2, 12] </ref> contain many papers on such work. However these computer solutions have usually been aimed at solving a unique problem with a very particular solution. Most often, the resulting program could not be easily reused for other similar problems. Our system is called Albert.

Reference-contexts: These systems provide a wealth of facilities for performing symbolic algebraic computation. Many are capable of computing a Grobner bases of the ideal generated by a set of multivariate polynomials. Such systems work well at manipulating polynomials in variables that commute and associate. The reader is referred to Caviness <ref> [3] </ref> for more on these computer systems. To our knowledge, however, little work has been done toward an interactive computer system specifically for performing nonassociative algebraic computation. The purpose of this paper is to describe an initial attempt at building a specialized, but useful, system for doing nonassociative algebra.

Reference-contexts: For example, the dimension shown for Jordan algebras in three letters agree with the numbers reported by Smith and Wos [15]. In some varieties, a natural basis for the free algebra is known. A theorem of Hall's <ref> [4] </ref> describes a basis for free Lie rings in terms of a set of "standard monomials". The dimensions for Lie algebras, shown in Table 1, are precisely the numbers predicted by Hall's theorem.

Reference-contexts: In Figure 2 we see the current dimension of the algebra as it completes each stage of the algorithm. The algorithm is described in detail by Hentzel and Jacobs <ref> [5] </ref>. Kleinfeld's construction by hand [11] served as a model for the method. After the algebra has been built, the polynomial command may be used. This command merely causes Albert to check if the polynomial expands to zero in the free algebra.
Reference: [6] <author> I.R. Hentzel and D.P. Jacobs, </author> <title> "Proofs for Non-Identities Using Characteristic Functions", </title> <note> submitted. </note>
Reference-contexts: For example, if a polynomial is an identity, Albert might print out a sequence of substitutions that show this to be the case. On the other hand, when a polynomial is not an identity, Albert could deliver either a counterexample such as the free algebra, or a characteristic function <ref> [6] </ref>. The Albert system is now in its infancy. Experience by the research community will influence how the system should develop. In any case, we feel that a useful, general purpose nonassociative algebra system is now possible. REFERENCES 11

Reference-contexts: With Albert, polynomials and identities may be entered from the computer keyboard using the familiar mathematical notation of parenthesized products, scalar multiplication, addition, subtraction, associators, commutators, and so on. The precise rules for expressing a 4 nonassociative polynomial are described by a context-free grammar <ref> [8] </ref>. Since the standard keyboard does not have the symbol ffi, we use fl to denote the Jordan product. We also permit the user to type &lt; x; y; z &gt; to mean (x ffi y) ffi z x ffi (y ffi z).

Reference-contexts: It is known <ref> [9] </ref> that any right alternative algebra over a field of characteristic 6= 2 satisfies the identity (wx; y; z) + (w; x; [y; z]) w (x; y; z) (w; y; z)x = 0 (4) For purposes of this paper let us call this identity the generalized right alternative law.

Reference-contexts: For more background in this area we refer to texts [14, 16]. The main problem addressed by Albert is the recognition of polynomial identities in varieties of nonassociative algebras.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we will describe its capabilities, briefly discuss its implementation, and then discuss some typical computations that Albert has performed. Albert Albert is an interactive program to assist research in nonassociative rings and algebras. For more background in this area we refer to texts <ref> [14, 16] </ref>. The main problem addressed by Albert is the recognition of polynomial identities in varieties of nonassociative algebras. <p> Following standard notation, the associator (a; b; c) denotes (ab)c a (bc), the commutator [a; b] denotes ab ba, and the Jordan product x ffi y denotes xy + yx. Of course, from Zhevlakov et al <ref> [16, p 145] </ref>, we know identity (3) holds in any alternative algebra. Nevertheless, we bring up Albert and supply it with the left and right alternative laws, using the identity command. This is shown in Figure 1. <p> Albert requires all polynomials and defining identities to be homogeneous. This restriction is usually not very severe, since any nonhomogeneous polynomial can be decomposed into its homogeneous components. This replacement will not affect the results, given a sufficiently high characteristic for the field <ref> [16, Theorem 3, p 7] </ref>. In particular, let f be a nonhomogeneous identity for which the maximum degree of the variables is k. Then if the underlying field has at least k elements, each homogeneous component of f will also be an identity.
