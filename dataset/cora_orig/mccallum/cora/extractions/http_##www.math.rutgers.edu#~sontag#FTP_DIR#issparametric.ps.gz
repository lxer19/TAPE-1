Reference-contexts: Here the uncertainty caused by the presence of unknown parameters makes the problem far harder, and results for systems without parameters cannot be generalized in a straightforward manner to families. When studying stabilizability for parameterized nonlinear systems, much work classically imposed restrictive "matching conditions" on uncertainties; see e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>, [4] and [5]. In later work, such as for instance [2], [11], [14] and [3], conditions were dropped and various local results were obtained. <p> One obtains input/state stabilizability for all values of -, or equivalently, the values of in . As an illustration, assume that one knows that the system _x = f (x; u; ) is stabilizable for 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Let (-) = sin 2 -.

Reference-contexts: One application of our techniques is in the study of the preservation of stability under cascades with integrators. This is the critical ingredient in the "backstepping technique" currently popular; see for instance the textbook [13], Section 4.8, and references there for stabilization, and <ref> [7] </ref> for many other issues. It is a natural extension of these studies to investigate the same question for parameterized families.

Reference-contexts: A basic tool is provided by the converse Lyapunov theorem established in <ref> [8] </ref>. In operator-theoretic studies of systems, the central interest is usually on a notion of "input to state" stability (ISS) defined in terms of finiteness of gains (operator norms). <p> In that reference, it was shown that, with this notion, a system is stabilizable with respect to an equilibrium if and only if it is input/state stabilizable. In <ref> [8] </ref>, this result was generalized to stability and ISS with respect to sets, using the above-mentioned converse theorem. Here, we show how these results can be extended to deal with families of systems (and stability with respect to sets). <p> These definitions apply in particular to systems that do not depend on parameters, of course. Some important facts and basic concepts about set stability for nonlinear systems without parameters are needed throughout the paper; we refer the reader to the Appendix and <ref> [8] </ref> for these. <p> Remark 2.4 Note that we made the blanket assumption that the system is complete. This property is needed in the technical proof of the converse Lyapunov theorem given in <ref> [8] </ref>. However, this assumption turns out to be superfluous in the case in which the closed invariant set A is compact. <p> It then can be shown (see <ref> [8] </ref>, [9]) that there exist some matrix 0 (~; ) and a K 1 -function such that @V f (~; k (~) + 0 (~; )v; ) 2 9 for all whenever j~j A (jvj). <p> Moreover, for this 0 , the system _x = f (x; k (x) + 0 (x)v; ) is forward complete. In fact, it is shown in <ref> [8] </ref> and [9] that 0 can be chosen as ' 0 I mfim for some smooth function ' 0 satisfying 0 &lt; ' 0 (~; ) 1 for all ~ and . <p> Let ' 2 be a smooth function such that 1 ' 1 (~) ' 2 (~) 4 for all ~ (such a function always exists, see <ref> [8] </ref>).

In operator-theoretic studies of systems, the central interest is usually on a notion of "input to state" stability (ISS) defined in terms of finiteness of gains (operator norms). As shown in <ref> [12] </ref>, and since explored by many other authors, a more natural notion for nonlinear systems is one in which the size of the state must satisfy a nonlinear estimate in terms of the initial state and the size of the control. <p> In other words, V is an ISS-Lyapunov function for the system _x = f (x; k (x) + (x)v; ) (16) for 2 with respect to A.
