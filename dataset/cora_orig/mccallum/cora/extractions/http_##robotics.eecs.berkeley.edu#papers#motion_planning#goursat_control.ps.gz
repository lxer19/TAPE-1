Abstract: This paper presents the method of exterior differential systems for analyzing nonlinear systems. The Goursat normal form is presented, and conditions are given for converting Pfaffian systems into this normal form. Since the Brunovsky normal form is a special case of the Goursat normal form, we also show how the exact linearization conditions for control systems can be restated in the language of Pfaffian systems. In addition, we give new conditions for converting Pfaffian systems into Goursat form after prolongation, and for linearizing control systems using dynamic extension.

Reference-contexts: The theory of exterior differential systems is powerful enough to analyze solutions of systems of partial differential equations; however, we will restrict ourselves in this paper to systems of first-order ordinary differential equations. We encourage the interested reader to consult the monograph by Bryant et. al. <ref> [1] </ref>, from which most of this introductory material was taken, for more details. <p> We will only work with systems which are maximally nonholonomic, that is, with bottom derived system I (N) = f0g. For reference, we state here a variant of the familiar Frobenius theorem: 6 TILBURY AND SASTRY Theorem 1. Frobenius <ref> [1] </ref>. Let f! 1 ; : : : ; ! p g be a set of linearly independent one-forms, and f 1 ; : : : ; f q a set of functions whose differentials are linearly independent of each other and of the ! i 's. <p> The GOURSAT NORMAL FORMS 7 following classical theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for converting a Pfaffian system into Goursat normal form: Theorem 2. Goursat Normal Form <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: s 2 , that is, there is only one tower which is 10 TILBURY AND SASTRY longest, it can be shown that if there exists any which satisfies the congruences, then there also exists an integrable 0 which also satisfies the congruences (with a rescaling of the basis forms), see <ref> [2, 6] </ref>. However, if s 1 = s 2 , or there are at least two towers which are longest, this is no longer true. Thus, we need the assumption that is integrable. <p> The superscripts j indicate the tower to which each form belongs, and the subscripts i index the position of the form within the j th tower. There are s j forms in the j th tower. An algorithm for converting systems to extended Goursat normal form is given in <ref> [2] </ref>. We also give another version of this theorem, which is easier to check, since it does not require finding a basis which satisfies the congruences but only one which is adapted to the derived flag.

Reference-contexts: This was a system of codimension two, corresponding to the fact that the linear and angular velocities of the front car are the inputs, and thus freely specifiable. In order to consider Pfaffian systems associated with mobile robots such as the firetruck <ref> [3, 9] </ref> or the multi-steering multi-trailer system [11] we need to work with systems of codimension greater than two. We have the following definition: Definition 5. Extended Goursat Normal Form. <p> Pfaffian Systems generated by Mobile Robots We now consider some multi-steering mobile robot systems and show that the Pfaffian systems generated by the constraints that the wheels roll without slipping satisfy the extended Goursat conditions. Example 1. Firetruck. Consider the example of a firetruck <ref> [3] </ref>. There are two steering wheels in the system: one at the front, for the driver, and another at the rear, for the tiller. <p> By Theorem 4, the system can be converted into extended Goursat normal form. We refer the reader to <ref> [3, 9] </ref> for the coordinate transformation (into chained form, which is the dual of Goursat form), and methods for steering the system.

Consider the single-input control system <ref> [4] </ref>, _x 1 = x 2 + x 3 _x 2 = x 3 This control system generates a Pfaffian system, I = fdx 1 (x 2 + x 3 2 )dt; dx 2 x 3 dt; dx 3 udtg (11) I is of codimension two on R 5 with coordinates <p> Proof. Apply Theorem 7 to the extended system ~ I. This theorem is similar to the one stated by Charlet, Levine, and Marino <ref> [4] </ref> which also gave sufficient conditions for linearizing systems by dynamic extension. Their conditions also relied on the existence of some integers b i which are the number of integrators added to the i th input channel. <p> We present a simple example to show how the theorem can be applied to linearize control systems using dynamic extension. Example 8. A control system satisfying the conditions of Theorem 8 but not the conditions of <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> We note that although this example can be linearized by dynamic extension, it is shown in <ref> [4] </ref> that it does not satisfy the sufficient conditions given in that paper. Remark 2. Dynamic State Feedback. We have shown that a prolongation by differentiation of a control system corresponds to a dynamic extension.

We have the following definition: Definition 5. Extended Goursat Normal Form. <p> By Theorem 4, the system can be converted into extended Goursat normal form. We refer the reader to [3, 9] for the coordinate transformation (into chained form, which is the dual of Goursat form), and methods for steering the system. A multi-steering trailer system was examined in <ref> [11] </ref>, and it was shown how to transform such a system into chained form (which is the dual of Goursat normal form) using dynamic state feedback. That is, states were added to the system and this augmented system was transformed into the dual of Goursat normal form. <p> This extension is shown in <ref> [11] </ref>, as are methods for steering this type of system. 6. Control Systems As we mentioned in the introduction, control systems are a special type of Pfaffian system, and therefore all of the results presented thus far can be specialized to control systems.
