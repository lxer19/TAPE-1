Abstract: In this paper we present approximation algorithms for median problems in metric spaces and fixed-dimensional Euclidean space. Our algorithms use a new method for transforming an optimal solution of the linear program relaxation of the s-median problem into a provably good integral solution. This transformation technique is fundamentally different from the methods of randomized and deterministic rounding [Rag, RaT] and the methods proposed in [LiV] in the following way: Previous techniques never set variables with zero values in the fractional solution to 1. This departure from previous methods is crucial for the success of our algorithms. fl Support was provided in part by an National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award CCR-9047466 with matching funds from IBM, by NSF research grant CCR-9007851, by Army Research Office grant DAAL03-91-G-0035, and by the Office of Naval Research and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under contract N00014-91-J-4052, ARPA order 8225.

We show in [LiV] that the number of medians cannot be approximated within better than logarithmic factors without violating the bound on total distance, unless the dominating set and set cover problems can be approximated within better than logarithmic factors. 2 Metric Spaces In this section we give the proof of Theorem 1.
