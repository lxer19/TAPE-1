Reference-contexts: of the prospects for this iteration of natural numbers followed. 20 Day 2, Tuesday, 2 October 1990 Morning Session 9.30-10.30 A Mechanized Theory of the Pi-calculus in HOL Tom Melham, Cambridge University, UK The -calculus is a process algebra in the style of CCS, developed by Milner, Parrow and Walker <ref> [1] </ref> for modelling concurrent systems in which the pattern of interconnection between processes can change over time. This talk described work in progress on a mechanized formal theory of the -calculus in higher order logic using the HOL theorem prover. <p> By this means, we hope to facilitate experimental investigations of variants of the calculus. Finally, we are trying to mechanize the -calculus exactly as it is presented in <ref> [1] </ref>. That is, we wish to avoid simplifying the calculus merely in order to make the job of mechanizing it easier. In the talk, at least one point at which we have compromised this last principle was discussed.
