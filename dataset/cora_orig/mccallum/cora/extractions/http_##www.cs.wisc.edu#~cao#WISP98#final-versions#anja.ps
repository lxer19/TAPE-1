Reference-contexts: The byte hit ratio similarly decreases from 40.9% to 30.42%. The significant increase of hit ratios produced by caching documents with cookies supports the importance of techniques aimed at enabling caching of such of documents. These techniques include approaches based on delta encoding <ref> [1, 5, 8] </ref> and client-side HTML macro-preprocessing [2]. The extent of the benefits of these techniques would depend on the amount of document customization based on the request cookies. 4.2 Bandwidth Savings An often-cited benefit of proxy caching is reduced network traffic on the Internet.

Reference-contexts: a configurable cache miss time overhead and a configurable cache hit time overhead are added to the request service time (during cache hits and cache misses, respectively). 3.2 Network Connections As we argue in the introduction, it is important to handle the interactions between HTTP and TCP, particularly persistent HTTP <ref> [3, 7, 9] </ref>. In PROXIM, each client maintains zero or more open connections to the proxy. An idle connection is one in which no request is currently active.

Reference-contexts: As another example of the importance of detail, consider the effect of cookies. Grib-ble and Brewer studied a large client population and found that the hit ratio for a proxy cache could approach 60% <ref> [4] </ref>. However, despite examining a number of factors that might contribute to particular resources not being cacheable, they omitted a significant contributing factor, cookies. Since cookies are methods of customizing resources on a per-user basis, it is inappropriate to cache HTTP/1.0 1 resources that have cookies in them. <p> This information is sufficient to determine how much time is taken by various components of the observed HTTP conversations. These traces are significantly more detailed than traces that other researchers have made available <ref> [4, 6] </ref>. For example, publicly-available traces lack timestamps for TCP events such as connection creation (SYN packets). 3 Simulator Our web proxy simulator, named PROXIM, simulates a proxy cache using the HTTP trace (described in Section 2) as input. <p> Surprisingly, the trace showed that over 30% of all requests had a cookie, which had a dramatic effect on the hit ratio. If the proxy ignored cookies, the hit ratio would have been 54.5%, in line with previous studies <ref> [4, 6] </ref>. By taking cookies into account, we observe the hit ratio of just 35.2%. The byte hit ratio similarly decreases from 40.9% to 30.42%. The significant increase of hit ratios produced by caching documents with cookies supports the importance of techniques aimed at enabling caching of such of documents.

Mogul. </author> <title> Exploring the bounds of web latency reduction from caching and prefetching. </title> <booktitle> In Proceedings of the Symposium on Internetwork-ing Systems and Technologies, </booktitle> <pages> pages 13-22. </pages> <publisher> USENIX, </publisher> <month> December </month> <year> 1997. </year>
Reference-contexts: Kroeger et al. examined the effect of caching and prefetching on end-user latency <ref> [6] </ref>. They found that proxy caching could reduce latency by 26% at most, which was much less than the 77% or more of latency that was attributed to communication between the proxy and the content providers. <p> This information is sufficient to determine how much time is taken by various components of the observed HTTP conversations. These traces are significantly more detailed than traces that other researchers have made available <ref> [4, 6] </ref>. For example, publicly-available traces lack timestamps for TCP events such as connection creation (SYN packets). 3 Simulator Our web proxy simulator, named PROXIM, simulates a proxy cache using the HTTP trace (described in Section 2) as input. <p> Surprisingly, the trace showed that over 30% of all requests had a cookie, which had a dramatic effect on the hit ratio.

The byte hit ratio similarly decreases from 40.9% to 30.42%. The significant increase of hit ratios produced by caching documents with cookies supports the importance of techniques aimed at enabling caching of such of documents. <p> This result is substantially more pessimistic than the upper bound of 26% latency reduction reported by Kroeger et al. <ref> [6] </ref>. The limited improvement is due to the high latency of the connection set-up (which had a mean of 1.3s in the trace), the effect of cookies described earlier, and modem bandwidth limitation on the clients (this study assumed 28.8 Kbps modems).
