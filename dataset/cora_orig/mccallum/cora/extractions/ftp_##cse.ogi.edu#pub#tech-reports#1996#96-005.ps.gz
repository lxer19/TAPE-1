Abstract: The overwhelming accessibility to data, on a global scale, does not necessarily translate to widespread utility of data. We often find that we are drowning in data, with few tools to help manage relevant data for our various activities. This paper presents Structured Maps, an additional modeling construct superimposed over available information sources, that provides structured and managed access to data. Structured Maps are based on Topic Navigation Maps, defined by the SGML community to provide multi-document indices and glossaries. In this paper, we define Structured Maps and present several examples adapted from the Sequent Corporate Electronic Library (SCEL), an intranet resource currently implemented in HTML.

Reference-contexts: Some work has focused on spatial modeling, representation and searching, [12, 26, 27]. One approach to storing and querying documents or other loosely structured information is to define a new self-describing data model <ref> [1, 5, 6] </ref>. Such techniques require the transformation or mapping of the underlying document structure into the new model. Other efforts store SGML documents directly in a database, capturing the DTD structure explicitly in the schema, e.g., [7, 23]. Such work is complementary to this research.

Reference-contexts: Another area related to this work is the Intelligent Integration of Information (I3) Architecture with intel ligent mediators introduced to facilitate interaction of various information sources and services <ref> [2] </ref>. The I3 pro gram is much more ambitious in its goals and in its techniques, employing intelligent agents to analyze infor mation sources, for example. Structured Maps adopt a simplified Entity-Relationship model, with the focus on explicit representation of information and connections.

Reference-contexts: We are less inclined to define a new language and more inclined to focus on the semantics and processing of a loosely coupled environment. We will likely use a database language that support objects and navigation, e.g., ODL and OQL <ref> [3] </ref>. From a lan 16 Lois M. L. Delcambre et al. guage point of view, we envision Structured Maps using embedded languages for addressing and even for querying the Information Universe, much like SGML supports arbitrary notations and HyTime supports addressing in an external syntax.

Reference-contexts: But we are currently guided by the definition of the Topic Naviga tion Map, defined as part of the working group on the Conventions for the Application of HyTime (CApH). A Topic Navigation Map is represented as an SGML document <ref> [4] </ref>. A Topic Navigation Map uses the terms topic, topic relation, topic title, and anchor role as the analogous terms for entity, relationship, title, and facet in Structured Maps. <p> Key features of Topic Navigation Maps that are pre served in Structured Maps are: the information represented in a Structured Map is expressible using SGML with HyTime and CApH <ref> [4] </ref> constructs, a Structured Map declares entity and relationship types (in the Structured Map definition), an instance of a Structured Map establishes the (typed and titled) entities and (typed) relationship instances as a database extension, the entity instances include the facet instances and their references, and the addressing mechanism and the <p> exploring the possibility of representing the value chain, in a similar form, at lower levels in the Sequent organization and reflecting it in a Structured Map. 6 Related Work and Evaluation The most closely related work is clearly the definition of Topic Navigation Maps, the basic foundation for Structured Maps <ref> [4, 34] </ref>. As an emerging ISO standard [35], Topic Navigation Maps can provide a precise syntax and interchange format for Structured Maps. The semantics of Topic Navigation Maps derive from SGML [37] and HyTime [9, 39] in that the choice of certain SGML or HyTime elements imply certain semantics.

Reference-contexts: Example Structured Map Structured Map instance, shown in the middle of the figure. 1 This Structured Map definition introduces two entity types: Painter and Painting, with a relationship type to indicate the painter (s) for a painting. We use OMT notation <ref> [22] </ref> because of the strong similarity of Structured Maps with an entity-relationship-style model (ERM). We use only one attribute for each entity, called "title". The title is used during browsing as a label for each entity instance.

But the opportunity for structural conflict is greatly reduced without attributes. In the best case, the integration of Structured Maps could reduce to the union of entity, relationship, and facet types plus the union of entity, relationship, and facet instances.

Reference-contexts: For Painting, we define just one facet named "mentioned". The middle box of Figure 2 shows the current instance of the Structured Map, having one Painter instance and one Painting instance, with "Gentile Bellini" 1 This example is adapted from one developed by High Text, S.A.R.L. <ref> [34] </ref>. and "Miracles of the Relic of the Cross" as titles, respectively. These two instances are connected by the painted-bypainter-of relationship. Of particular interest are the references used to populate the facets. <p> We have transferred information from an SGML Topic Navigation Map document to a database and, in the reverse direction, transferred Structured Map instance information back into a SGML document that represents a Topic Navigation Map. 4.1 Initial Prototype This first prototype used a commercial product, called EnLIGHTeN 2 <ref> [34] </ref>, as the baseline for the exercise. EnLIGHTeN supports an integrated browser for Topic Navigation Maps over SGML, HTML, and text documents. With EnLIGHTeN, the Topic Navigation Map SGML document plus all of the documents in the underlying Information Universe are parsed by an SGML parser and then stored. <p> Another possibility is to mark information elements in the underlying universe with the entity type, entity instance title, and name of the facet type. This approach would allow the establishment of an address on the proper facet for the proper instance; it has been implemented this way in EnLIGHTeN <ref> [34] </ref>. Yet another possibility would be to support visual display of both the Structured Map and the Structured Maps: Modeling Explicit Semantics over a Universe of Information 9 Fig. 5. CARTE Screen information sources with an easy point and click identification of referenced information elements. <p> exploring the possibility of representing the value chain, in a similar form, at lower levels in the Sequent organization and reflecting it in a Structured Map. 6 Related Work and Evaluation The most closely related work is clearly the definition of Topic Navigation Maps, the basic foundation for Structured Maps <ref> [4, 34] </ref>. As an emerging ISO standard [35], Topic Navigation Maps can provide a precise syntax and interchange format for Structured Maps. The semantics of Topic Navigation Maps derive from SGML [37] and HyTime [9, 39] in that the choice of certain SGML or HyTime elements imply certain semantics.

Reference-contexts: As declared in the Committee Draft submitted to ISO, a Topic Navigation Map provides a mechanism to define tables of contents, subject indexes, glossaries, and multi-lingual thesauri for a single document or for a set of documents <ref> [35] </ref>. The purpose of a Topic Navigation Map is to highlight individual topics that appear in a set of documents and also to establish relationships among topics. <p> Our motivations for following the definition of Topic Navigation Maps are: Topic Navigation Maps are currently being proposed as an ISO standard to provide multi-document indices, glossaries and table of contents <ref> [35] </ref>. The standard could provide Structured Maps with an ISO standard interchange format. Topic Navigation Maps, although developed outside of the database community, use a basic Entity Relationship model at the core. <p> As an emerging ISO standard <ref> [35] </ref>, Topic Navigation Maps can provide a precise syntax and interchange format for Structured Maps. The semantics of Topic Navigation Maps derive from SGML [37] and HyTime [9, 39] in that the choice of certain SGML or HyTime elements imply certain semantics.

Reference-contexts: The EnLIGHTeN engine supports bidirectional navigation across facet and relationship instances. EnLIGHTeN resolves all references that appear on the facet instances. In our first prototype, we parsed a Topic Navigation Map SGML document from EnLIGHTeN and populated an Informix 3 <ref> [36] </ref> relational database with both the Structured Map definition and instance information. We defined a generic schema for this purpose, i.e., with relations for entity types and entity instances.

Reference-contexts: Topic Navigation Maps, although developed outside of the database community, use a basic Entity Relationship model at the core. The Entity Relationship model has proven to be widely understandable and useful for information representation and access, using database technology. Topic Navigation Maps are defined using SGML <ref> [37] </ref> and HyTime [38]. Together they provide a model to describe the structure and semantics of complex documents, a foundation currently lacking in conven tional database models. Topic Navigation Maps use a DTD to describe the structure of the document instance, analogous to the database schema and instance. <p> As an emerging ISO standard [35], Topic Navigation Maps can provide a precise syntax and interchange format for Structured Maps. The semantics of Topic Navigation Maps derive from SGML <ref> [37] </ref> and HyTime [9, 39] in that the choice of certain SGML or HyTime elements imply certain semantics. Within the digital library research community [32, 33], there is little focus explicitly on the conceptual model for information.

Reference-contexts: This content model allows any number of topic and topic relation instances to appear in any order in the document instance. Topic Navigation Maps depend on the use of several HyTime constructs, particularly those for linking and addressing. HyTime (ISO 10744:1992) <ref> [38] </ref> extends the semantics of SGML but is expressed in ordinary SGML syntax. In the Topic Navigation Map of Figure 3, each topic type is declared through the %topic parameter entity; each topic instance has a topic title (shown in the content model for each topic declaration). <p> Topic Navigation Maps, although developed outside of the database community, use a basic Entity Relationship model at the core. The Entity Relationship model has proven to be widely understandable and useful for information representation and access, using database technology.
