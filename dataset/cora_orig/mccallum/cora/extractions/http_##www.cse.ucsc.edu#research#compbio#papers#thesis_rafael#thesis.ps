Reference-contexts: The following recursive definitions of D G (j) and D NG (j) can be converted into a dynamic programming algorithm (see Auger and Lawrence <ref> [1] </ref>, Sankoff [12] and Snyder and Stormo [14]).

Translational Initiation Using a collection of 1055 E. coli ribosome binding sites from Barrick et. al. <ref> [2] </ref> a weight matrix of the 4 nucleotides for the sequence -12 to +2 was built. A sequence logo model [10] of this can be seen in Figure 5a of the Barrick article.

Reference-contexts: We recommend that the parser be modified to work on more general databases than EcoSeq6 (the E.Coli sequence database). For this parser's applicability to non-E.Coli organisms to be shown, it should be able to use training data from ACEDB <ref> [4] </ref>, which is a genome database system being used to store sequences of many organisms. Eventually these methods will be applied to the human genome to locate coding regions. However, eucaryote genomes are much more complex because their genes contain introns.

Reference-contexts: A publication should be forthcoming describing the equa tions which are necessary to do this. False + For elimination of false positives, we think that analyzing contigs for G/C content and modifying the gene codon usage tables might be successful <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The contigs contain genes previously identified by biochemical methods, but the gene record is incomplete and partially incorrect. The datasets we used for training and testing the parser are actually a subset of the ones used by Krogh in <ref> [7] </ref>. We used 235 training contigs (478 when reverse complements were counted) and 100 (200 with reverse contigs). Krogh's sets are a partition of a subset of EcoSeq6 into a train and test set. <p> we are parsing 100 or more contigs at a time, this will cause the program to run out of memory on a DEC-Alpha with about 90MB RAM. 5 RESULTS 18 5 Results We measured the performance of the parser on a subset of contigs provided by Anders Krogh used in <ref> [7] </ref>. Krogh used the HMM EColi gene finder both with and without an augmented intergenic model (similar to our promoter sensor). Krogh reports a rate of 78.7% genes in the training set found and 85.2% of the genes in the test set found.

The EcoSeq6 database provides a wealth of information for the computational biologist. It contains 458 distinct "contigs", regions of the E.Coli chromosome that have already been sequenced. The database is compact enough to be stored on a modest workstation.

Reference-contexts: The score is the sum of the L G and L NG matrices corresponding to those regions: fi () = L NG (1; 2) + L G (3; 7) + L NG (8; 8) (7) 2.2 Finding the Best Parse (This section is taken with permission from <ref> [17] </ref> because it succinctly describes the process of finding the best parse). Given the L matrices, a simple dynamic programming algorithm can find the parse of S with the highest score (called the "best parse"). The constraints that apply are that exons and introns alternate and are adjacent and non-overlapping.
