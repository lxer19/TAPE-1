Reference-contexts: Vacuum-emission devices have the advantage over their solid-state counterparts of operation with minimal degradation in high-temperature and high-radiation environments, and may also offer speed advantages. Many researchers are studying high-electric-field vacuum microdevices, which typically use sharply pointed conical or wedge-shaped tips at room temperature as the cathodes <ref> [1] </ref>. In contrast, in this research we employ thermionic emission from heated tungsten filaments as the source of electrons in devices we call "microtubes." This approach has been used by other researchers using heated polysilicon filaments [2].

Reference-contexts: In contrast, in this research we employ thermionic emission from heated tungsten filaments as the source of electrons in devices we call "microtubes." This approach has been used by other researchers using heated polysilicon filaments <ref> [2] </ref>. All of our microtubes have structures similar to that of the triode shown in Fig. 1. The coplanar filaments are made of tungsten and are typically 200 mm long, 3-15 mm wide, and 0.7 mm thick.

Reference-contexts: Because the cathode filament in these microtubes is heated to incandescence for thermionic emission (Fig. 1d), the device can also function as a microscopic broadband radiation source (microlamp), as has been previously demonstrated with a polysilicon filament sealed in vacuum cavity <ref> [3] </ref>. Due to their low melting point, however, polysilicon filaments can only emit relatively faint radiation that peaks in the infrared-to-red portion of the spectrum. With tungsten filaments, microlamps can be heated sufficiently to emit intense white light.

Reference-contexts: As the anode voltage is increased, the current becomes limited by thermionic emission from the cathode, which increases with cathode temperature. Current continues to increase with V A because of Schottky-barrier lowering at the cathode surface <ref> [4] </ref>. According to fundamental vacuum-tube theory, the space-charge-limited current depends on voltage as I A = GV A where G is a constant for a fixed tube geometry known as the perveance [4]. <p> Current continues to increase with V A because of Schottky-barrier lowering at the cathode surface <ref> [4] </ref>. According to fundamental vacuum-tube theory, the space-charge-limited current depends on voltage as I A = GV A where G is a constant for a fixed tube geometry known as the perveance [4]. A plot of log I A vs. log V A would, from (1), have a slope of 3/2, which does not match the measured microtube data (Fig. 4c). <p> referred to as the amplification factor m, where m = -V A /V G | I A =constant . (2) While g m and r o vary with operating point, m has been observed to be relatively independent of V A and V G , as expected from vacuum-triode theory <ref> [4] </ref>. The amplifiction factor varies with device layout (cathode to grid spacing, cathode to anode spacing, grid width, etc.), but is typically in the range 1.5 &lt; m &lt; 6 for our devices.
