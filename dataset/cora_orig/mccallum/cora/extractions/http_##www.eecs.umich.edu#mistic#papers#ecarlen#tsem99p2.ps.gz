Abstract: This paper is the second in a series of two papers describing the methodology and algorithms used in the development of MISTIC (Michigan Synthesis Tools for Integrated Circuits). Part I discussed the basic topological algorithms used to produce generic sequences of processing steps required for the fabrication of a given device structure. Part II discusses the expansion of these sequences into complete process flows. This procedure involves the selection of specific recipes from a set of available processing resources and the calculation of recipe parameters. These processing resources are stored in a database central to the MISTIC system framework. Since many process flows are generated for a given device, the paper also discusses the calculation of suitable figures of merit. The capabilities of the MISTIC system are demonstrated with a BiCMOS example. The MISTIC system framework which contains the basic compiler and several supporting modules: a device builder, process viewer, and database editor is also presented.

Reference-contexts: The large sudden declines in the figure of merit are caused by a combination of non-localized reactive steps and the proximity requirement between the gate oxide reactive step and the n + gate polysilicon deposition step. Additional results for NMOS and CMOS devices have been reported in <ref> [2] </ref>. V. THE SYSTEM FRAMEWORK The MISTIC system consists of four different modules: the device builder, the compilation module, the process viewer, and the database editor all centered around a common database.

Reference-contexts: The parametric recipes used in MISTIC are rigid with very few variable parameters (usually just one). This is in sharp contrast to other approaches where many recipe parameters can be adjusted according to an expected surface response curve <ref> [7] </ref>. The rigid parameterization used here is largely justified by the very sensitive behavior of thin film equipment since only finely-tuned recipes give reproducible results.

Reference-contexts: Currently the database contains 50 deposition atoms, 4 different lithography atoms, and about 500 etchant atoms constructed from experimental data collected at the University of Michigan Solid-State Electronics Laboratory and etch data published elsewhere <ref> [8, 9] </ref>. B. The Device Builder The device builder is a graphical drawing tool. Devices are schematically drawn on a two-dimensional canvas as a collection of polygons, each corresponding to a single component. In order to draw a component, the type menu is first selected.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the factors that contribute to the figure of merit in each step and their relative significance should be investigated more comprehensively to determine improved figures of merit. Some of this work is currently being investigated <ref> [10, 11] </ref>. Despite these pitfalls, the compiler implementation presented in this paper includes the fundamental steps required for the assembly of a process flow; hence it is a valuable tool for the rapid generation of device processes consistent with good design outlines satisfying specific requirements.
