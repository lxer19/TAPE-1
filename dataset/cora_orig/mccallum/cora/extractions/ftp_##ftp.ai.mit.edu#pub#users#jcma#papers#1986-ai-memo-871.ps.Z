Abstract: Discussions of the theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence increasingly refer to hermeneutics, a branch of continental European philosophy concerned with human understanding and the interpretation of written texts. Dreyfus and Wino-grad draw heavily on hermeneutics to question the feasibility of AI and cognitive science. But, hermeneutics also offers insights that may contribute to the understanding of meaning, translation, architectures for natural language understanding, and even to the methods suitable for scientific inquiry in AI. After briefly reviewing the historical development of hermeneutics as a method of interpretation, from its classical use through the modern debates, this article examines the contributions of hermeneutics to the human sciences. This background provides perspective for a review of recent hermeneutically-oriented AI research. This includes the Alker, Lehnert and Schneider computer-assisted techniques for coding the affective structures of narratives, the earlier positive proposal by Winograd, and subsequently Bateman, the later pessimistic Winograd and Flores on the possibility of AI, as well as the system-building efforts of Duffy and Mallery.

Bateman says these formalisms are based on the "ontological assumption" of an interpreter who follows rules in acting upon a mental representation of a situation. <p> Thus, their work amounts to a critique of the tractability of the "hard AI" project. As such, it constitutes a continuation of the critique AI begun by Dreyfus <ref> [1] </ref> but differs in that it comes from within AI and is argued in more computational terms. However, Winograd and Flores fail to demonstrate convincingly demonstrate that computer understanding exceeds the range of the possible.

To help clarify the relevance of hermeneutics for AI research, this article first reviews the major strains of hermeneutic thought. <p> In their investigations of the affective structure of texts and in their concern with systematic rules for identifying the genres of narrative, Alker, Lehnert, and Schneider [5] in effect pursue a classical hermeneutical program tempered by phenomenological hermeneutics.

Winograd <ref> [2] </ref> uses insights primarily from philosophical hermeneutics to sketch a new approach to natural language understanding. He intends to overcome the pitfalls of earlier approaches that succumbed to the phenomenological critique advanced by Dreyfus [1]. <p> Winograd [2: 231-33] grounds his theory of meaning in terms of social action, and so takes a position close to critical hermeneutics, between relativism and objectivism.

Although they share some of the hermeneutically oriented views and concerns articulated in Winograd <ref> [2] </ref> and Bate-man [6, 7], their implementation allows more concrete specification and testing of their theory, which currently focuses on earlier processing levels.

Reference-contexts: Applying certain hermeneutic insights, Dreyfus [1], Winograd [2] and Winograd and Flores [3] have questioned the functionalist cognitive science paradigm that guides most contemporary AI research, particularly in natural language processing and common-sense reasoning. Dreyfus draws upon the hermeneutic philosophy of Martin Heidegger <ref> [4] </ref> to deny the possibility of formalizing mental processes, and therefore, creating artificial intelligences. 1 Winograd and Flores reach a similar conclusion based on a hermeneutically-informed technical argument. <p> possibility of such a model nor denies the potential for a valid interpretation. 3 See Dilthey [23] for a sampling of Dilthey's writings on history and the human sciences, and Ermarth [24] and Plantinga [25] for their discussion. 5 3 Philosophical Hermeneutics 3.1 Heidegger's Ontological Hermeneutics In Being and Time <ref> [4] </ref>, Heidegger undermines the notion of objectivity in Husserl's phenomenology 4 [31], and by extension, in methodological hermeneutics. Husserl argues that objective interpretation is possible using his transcendental phenomenological method that requires bracketing the subjectivity inhering in the interpreter's life-world (Lebenswelt), the world of personal experience and desires. <p> The connection between hermeneutics and phenomenology traces to Heidegger who took the term "hermeneutics" from Dilthey to distinguish his own philosophical investigation of everyday being from Husserl's transcendental phenomenol 10 McCarthy [57] provides a short review of the debate and a discussion various problems in Habermas' position. McCarthy <ref> [58: ch. 3, 4] </ref> provides a more detail overview of the debate and a systematic rendition of Habermas' arguments. <p> Like Heidegger, Ricoeur also follows Husserl to eidetic phenomenology, but like the late Heidegger and, particularly, Gadamer, Ricoeur recognizes the ontological basis of understanding in language. For Ricoeur, then, the subject's being is not identical with immediate experiences. So, instead of attempting a direct description of Dasein like Heidegger <ref> [4] </ref> and Merleau-Ponty [65, 66], Ricoeur sees the need for a hermeneutic theory of interpretation to uncover the underlying meaning constituting Dasein. Through its emphasis on the pre-linguistic, eidetic phenomenology supplies a means of distancing observation from linguistic descriptions that immediately call up preconceptions.

Their "computational hermeneutics" builds from Lehnert's earlier work on "plot units" [86, 87]. Plot units provide a unvalidated but nevertheless interesting vocabulary for designating affective relationships and their combinations.

Reference-contexts: Other researchers [2, 6, 7] draw from philosophical hermeneutics to propose strategies for developing computer systems that understand natural language. A third approach [3], aligned with philosophical hermeneutics, argues that computer understanding of natural language is exceedingly difficult and probably intractable. A fourth group <ref> [8] </ref> has developed an implementation guided in part by ideas from phenomenological hermeneutics but informed by the other variants as well. Hermeneutic theories differ in several characteristic ways from approaches to meaning and understanding which are better known to AI researchers. <p> Moreover, because it learns rules on the basis of its experience (its effective history) over which it can draw analogies, Winston's program represents a first computational approximation of the basic hermeneutic notion of a pre-understanding grounded in effective-history. 7.4 Grounding Meaning in Eidetic Phenomenology Mallery and Duffy <ref> [8] </ref> present a computational model of semantic perception the process of mapping from a syntactic representation into a semantic representation. <p> Although they share some of the hermeneutically oriented views and concerns articulated in Winograd [2] and Bate-man [6, 7], their implementation allows more concrete specification and testing of their theory, which currently focuses on earlier processing levels. For example, Mallery and Duffy <ref> [8] </ref> have proposed constraint-interpreting reference [109] as a model that conforms to lexical-interpretive semantics, just as discrimination nets are well-suited to approaches relying on semantic primitives [110, 111, 112, 107].

Reference-contexts: Circles or spirals of understanding arise in interpreting one's own language, a foreign language or an observed action, in confirming a theory and in distinguishing between background knowledge and facts <ref> [9] </ref>. The existence of these circularities raises questions for hermeneutics regarding the grounding and validity of understanding. <p> text was produced and places the text in that world. 3 This circular process precludes an interpretation of a text from being unique and scientifically objective, like the explanation of a chemical reaction, inasmuch as knowledge of the author's or agent's world may itself critically depend on the present interpretation <ref> [9] </ref>. Dilthey and his recent followers, Hirsch [26] and Betti [27], claim, however, that interpretations become more valid as they assimilate more knowledge about the author and the author's values, instead of reflecting the interpreter's own values or sense of reality.

The combination of situated action as a control structure and resource-limited reasoning grounded in common-sense, stereotype-based reasoning [2: 220, 235] resonates with recent work on analogy [95, 96, 97: ch. 12], precedential reasoning [98], and metaphor <ref> [99, 16] </ref>. At its core, KRL also incorporates a notion of bootstrapping similar to the one found in the various hermeneutic traditions, particularly in the works of Heidegger and Gadamer. Winograd argues that spurious reification, or misplaced concreteness, has plagued earlier efforts to develop a formalisms for representing natural language.

Reference-contexts: Dilthey and his recent followers, Hirsch <ref> [26] </ref> and Betti [27], claim, however, that interpretations become more valid as they assimilate more knowledge about the author and the author's values, instead of reflecting the interpreter's own values or sense of reality. <p> According to the hypothesis, complete translations between languages is impossible, and understanding another language requires complete immersion, accompanied by a change in thinking. 8 Gadamer's position prompts the philologists Betti [27] and Hirsch <ref> [26] </ref> to complain that its relativism destroys all bases for validating an interpretation and so defeats the purpose of interpretation. Social theorist Habermas [38] also criticizes Gadamer's relativism. <p> The wide range of hypothesis formation means that possible interpretations may be reached through many paths. Following Hirsch <ref> [26] </ref>, explanation becomes a process of validating informed guesses. Validation proceeds through rational argument and debate based a model of judicial procedures in legal reasoning. It is therefore distinguished from verification which relies on logical proof. <p> Although Abel concedes that they may be useful in setting up lawlike hypotheses for testing, he concludes that they are neither necessary nor sufficient to constitute a human science.

Reference-contexts: Dilthey and his recent followers, Hirsch [26] and Betti <ref> [27] </ref>, claim, however, that interpretations become more valid as they assimilate more knowledge about the author and the author's values, instead of reflecting the interpreter's own values or sense of reality. <p> According to the hypothesis, complete translations between languages is impossible, and understanding another language requires complete immersion, accompanied by a change in thinking. 8 Gadamer's position prompts the philologists Betti <ref> [27] </ref> and Hirsch [26] to complain that its relativism destroys all bases for validating an interpretation and so defeats the purpose of interpretation. Social theorist Habermas [38] also criticizes Gadamer's relativism. <p> Although Abel concedes that they may be useful in setting up lawlike hypotheses for testing, he concludes that they are neither necessary nor sufficient to constitute a human science.

Husserl argues that objective interpretation is possible using his transcendental phenomenological method that requires bracketing the subjectivity inhering in the interpreter's life-world (Lebenswelt), the world of personal experience and desires. Heidegger denies that this bracketing is possible.

As each opposition is resolved, the resulting synthesis is found to be opposed to yet another concept and that opposition must also be dialectically resolved.

Reference-contexts: Social theorist Habermas <ref> [38] </ref> also criticizes Gadamer's relativism. See below. 3.2 Gadamer's Philosophical Hermeneutic 7 moves the text beyond its original psychological and historical contexts and gives it a certain "ideality" of meaning, which is elaborated in a dialogue between the interpreter and the text. <p> Gadamer sees Haber-mas' effort as part of the traditional social scientific goal of attaining "objective" knowledge of the social realm. Habermas <ref> [38] </ref> appears to believe that the social theorist, like Schleiermacher's interpreter, can understand the social actor better than the social actor understands himself. That is beyond belief for Gadamer, given his notion of ontological pre-understanding.

Reference-contexts: At a minimum, the practical need to assess truth-claims and interpretations had to be reconciled with the critique of objectivity. Apel <ref> [42] </ref> and Habermas [43, 44] sought the means for the reconciliation in conjoining methodological hermeneutics with ordinary language philosophy. Their point of departure was the "critique of ideology," originated by Marx, which argues that beliefs and ideas reflect the holders' social class interests. <p> Their initial strategy is to unmask the justifications given for these practices as distortions of the actors' true needs and the conditions of the situation. Yet, hermeneutic understanding will not reveal why the actors accept these justifications. In presenting psychoanalysis as the paradigmatic emancipatory science, Apel <ref> [42, 74] </ref> emphasizes that human beings cannot fully acknowledge their own motives or the intentions in their expressions. Consequently, empathy and introspection need to be supplemented by a quasi-naturalistic turn that applies the causal analysis of natural science to the actor's behavior.

Reference-contexts: Apel and Habermas argue that of the three divisions of the study of language - syntactics, semantics, and pragmatics only the first two have been adequately studied by the school of ordinary language philosophy descending from Wittgenstein <ref> [45] </ref>. They believe that no account of human understanding can be believed if explained as a theory about a single, asocial and ahistorical being. <p> The support comes from the sociologist Peter Winch [78], who generates recommendations for a social science on the basis of the later Wittgenstein's analysis <ref> [45] </ref> that particular word use and discourse patterns - "language games"| reflect and constitute activities in semi-institutionalized, functional areas of life - "life-forms." Winch consequently contends that the analysis of social actions (both verbal and non-verbal) has a necessarily holistic, situation oriented, interpretive character, rather than a generalizing, explanatory one. 14

By virtue of its emphasis on innovation in language and polysemy, lexical-interpretive semantics is perhaps most closely aligned with the phenomenological hermeneutics of Ricoeur <ref> [64] </ref>. Interpretation builds from an eidetic level of representation, the syntactically normalized semantic representation. The determination of meaning congruence classes becomes an early level of a more general and open-ended hermeneutic interpretation.

Reference-contexts: For Ricoeur, then, the subject's being is not identical with immediate experiences. So, instead of attempting a direct description of Dasein like Heidegger [4] and Merleau-Ponty <ref> [65, 66] </ref>, Ricoeur sees the need for a hermeneutic theory of interpretation to uncover the underlying meaning constituting Dasein. Through its emphasis on the pre-linguistic, eidetic phenomenology supplies a means of distancing observation from linguistic descriptions that immediately call up preconceptions.

Reference-contexts: Through its emphasis on the pre-linguistic, eidetic phenomenology supplies a means of distancing observation from linguistic descriptions that immediately call up preconceptions. This distanciation <ref> [66.5] </ref> is precisely what is required for interpretation to proceed. Since the task of uncovering the underlying objectivity cannot be achieved through the suspension of subjectivity, Ricoeur concludes that Husserl's project of transcendental phenomenology can only be realized through the application of a methodological hermeneutics to an eidetic phenomenology.

Reference-contexts: Structuralism refers to a mode of inquiry which inventories elements of a system and notes the grammar of possible combinations. It is exemplified by Saussurean linguistics and Levi-Strauss' anthropology <ref> [67] </ref>. Ricoeur finds the value of structuralist analysis lies in its ability to catalogue phenomena and describe their possible combinations, but its weakness lies in its inability to provide anything more insightful than behavioral descriptions of closed systems.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, the ability to generate structural descriptions complements the hermeneutic method, which interprets these descriptions by assigning functional roles to the phenomena. In his treatment of psychoanalysis, particularly the interpretation of dreams, Ri-coeur <ref> [68] </ref> shows the complexity involved in this hermeneutic task of assigning functional roles to words and symbols. The analyst must develop an interpretive system to analyze the dream-text and uncover the hidden meanings and desires behind its symbols, particularly those which have multiple senses (polysemy).

Reference-contexts: Thus, there are two opposing tendencies, a revolutionary and a conservative hermeneutics. Whereas the critical hermeneutics of Apel and Habermas falls within revolutionary demystification, the phenomenological hermeneutics of Ricoeur and the philosophical hermeneutics of Gadamer fall in the more conservative camp of the demythologizers. Ricoeur <ref> [69] </ref> attempts a dialectical resolution of the Habermas-Gadamer debate, arguing that the hermeneutics of tradition and the critique of ideology require each other. 12 5 PHENOMENOLOGICAL HERMENEUTICS He denies the alleged antinomy between the ontology of tradition which limits possible meanings (Gadamer) and the eschatology of freedom which seeks to transcend

Reference-contexts: Only when they are radically and artificially separated, argues Ricoeur, does each assume the character and tenor of ideology. 5.1 The Hermeneutic Arc: Ricoeur's Theory of Interpretation Ricoeur's theory of interpretation <ref> [70] </ref> seeks a dialectical integration for Dilthey's dichotomy of explanation (erklaren) and existential understanding (verstehen). Ricoeur begins by distinguishing the fundamentally different interpretive paradigms for discourse (written text) and dialogue (hearing and speaking).

Reference-contexts: It is therefore distinguished from verification which relies on logical proof. As Hirsch notes, this model may lead into a dilemma of "self-confirmability" when non-validatable hypotheses are proposed. Ricoeur escapes this dilemma by incorporating Popper's notion of "falsifiability" <ref> [71] </ref> into his methods for validation, which he applies to the internal coherence of an interpretation and the relative plausibility of competing interpretations. 13 In the second hermeneutic that moves from explanation to understanding, Ricoeur distinguishes two stances regarding the referential function of text: a subjective approach and a structuralist alternative.

The equality suggests that an appropriate methodology will resemble discussions in which members in a community justify their actions. <p> They do not recognize that interpretation includes both "translation" and "application," that is, the mediation between the disintegrating and the emerging language-games, on one hand, and the revitalization of the past and its assimilation into the present life-form, on the other hand <ref> [73] </ref>. 16 6 HERMENEUTICS AS META-SCIENCE than what the word signified in Newtonian mechanics. <p> Additionally, as Apel <ref> [73] </ref> notes, justifications for scientific statements ultimately rely on ordinary language to establish procedural norms regarding evidence and argumentation. <p> Gadamer essentially considers this move incoherent and ungrounded, since it 17 rejects the very tradition, including the value of rational, non-coerced consensus, that the investigator must accept to begin the explication. In response, Habermas [43] and Apel <ref> [73] </ref> claim that the preference for reason and understanding the grounding for hermeneutics is not just arbitrary or an inherited prejudice in the Western cultural tradition.

Consequently, empathy and introspection need to be supplemented by a quasi-naturalistic turn that applies the causal analysis of natural science to the actor's behavior.

Reference-contexts: He concludes that deductive logic can account for only a small fraction of human reasoning, and therefore new advances in natural language understanding require "a calculus of natural reasoning" [2: 219]. Winograd proposes Knowledge Representation Language (KRL) <ref> [93] </ref> as a starting point for an alternative approach. KRL's reasoning based on limited computational resources captures Heidegger's thesis of the finititude of Dasein and also echoes Simon's notion of "bounded rationality" in the theory of decision-making [94].

KRL's reasoning based on limited computational resources captures Heidegger's thesis of the finititude of Dasein and also echoes Simon's notion of "bounded rationality" in the theory of decision-making <ref> [94] </ref>. For Winograd, effective reasoning strategies under limited or variable computational resources provide a "natural reasoning," which, although formally incomplete, can account for more of everyday natural language usage than can the small fraction that fits the mold of a complete deductive logic [2: 219].

Reference-contexts: Fundamental assumptions and philosophical orientations underlying research must now be explicitly analyzed and justified. In rejecting "objectivism," Winograd advocates a "subjectivist" hermeneutical position that builds from Maturana's <ref> [100] </ref> notion of the nervous system as "structure determined," plastic and closed.
Reference: [101] <editor> I. Lakatos, </editor> <publisher> Proofs and Refutations Cambridge University Press, </publisher> <address> Cambridge, </address> <year> 1976. </year>
Reference-contexts: Unlike Heidegger, who recognized the importance of the environment but failed to analyze it, Winograd is led to the analysis of the environment by several influences. These include Garfinkel's [63] ethnomethodology, which emphasizes social context, Searle's focus on speech as social action, and Lakatos' <ref> [101] </ref> argument that even in mathematics the meanings of terms are contingent on outside context. Winograd [2: 231-33] grounds his theory of meaning in terms of social action, and so takes a position close to critical hermeneutics, between relativism and objectivism.

Reference-contexts: The resulting connotational structure captures a kind of collective background knowledge and imposes a priori constraints on the actions of individuals who contemplate actions in terms of the language. In Halliday's "systemic grammar" <ref> [102] </ref>, there is the notion of a "social semiotic" that acknowledges that a group's culture can restrict the possible meanings of utterances through constraints on possible ways of acting in situations.

Reference-contexts: Yet despite this openness to social constraints, Bateman does not consider hermeneuticists who came after Heidegger, most notably Gadamer and Habermas. 7.3 The Foundations of Understanding In a more recent work, Winograd and Flores [3] draw upon philosophical hermeneutics and Maturana's <ref> [103] </ref> work on the biology of cognition to deny the possibility of the construction of intelligent computers is impossible, as is computer understanding of natural language.

Reference-contexts: Some computational and non-computational linguists <ref> [105, 106, 88] </ref> advocate determining equivalent meanings (paraphrases) through the reduction of different surface forms to a canon-icalized semantic form, a combination of semantic universals (e.g., "conceptual dependency" primitives).

Reference-contexts: Interpretation builds from an eidetic level of representation, the syntactically normalized semantic representation. The determination of meaning congruence classes becomes an early level of a more general and open-ended hermeneutic interpretation. Stimulated by recent discussions of perception by Feigenbaum and Simon <ref> [107] </ref>, Mallery and Duffy consider semantic perception to be a process of mapping from sense-data, in this case natural language sentences, to a semantic representation. <p> For example, Mallery and Duffy [8] have proposed constraint-interpreting reference [109] as a model that conforms to lexical-interpretive semantics, just as discrimination nets are well-suited to approaches relying on semantic primitives <ref> [110, 111, 112, 107] </ref>. They ground this choice both in the available experimental psycholinguistic evidence and in the desirable computational properties of reference based on constraint interpretation.

Reference-contexts: Mallery and Duffy have implemented this theory, up to the level of eidetic representation, in the RELATUS Natural Language System <ref> [108] </ref>. Although they share some of the hermeneutically oriented views and concerns articulated in Winograd [2] and Bate-man [6, 7], their implementation allows more concrete specification and testing of their theory, which currently focuses on earlier processing levels.
