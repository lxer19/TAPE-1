Reference-contexts: Introduction A folium is a generic term for a leaf-shaped curve. According to Lawrence <ref> [1, page 151] </ref>, the curve defined by the equation y 2 + x (x + b) = 4axy 2 (1.1) was known to Kepler in 1609 and generates a Simple-, Double- or Tri-Folium, when b 4a, b = 0 or 0 &lt; b &lt; 4a, respectively. 1.1 Reparameterization To draw the
