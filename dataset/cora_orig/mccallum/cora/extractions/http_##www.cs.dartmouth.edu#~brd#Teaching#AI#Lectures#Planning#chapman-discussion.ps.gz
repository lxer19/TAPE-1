Reference-contexts: A class of planning known as 'nonlinear planning' can solve this problem, and Chapman's solution is based on this concept due to Sacerdoti <ref> [2] </ref>. I will expand on nonlinear planning later in my discussion of TWEAK. 2. The Problem David Chapman first became interested in planning in an unorthodox manner.

Reference-contexts: I will expand on nonlinear planning later in my discussion of TWEAK. 2. The Problem David Chapman first became interested in planning in an unorthodox manner. He wanted a planner to be a part of a integrated problem solver he was working on, and had heard that Sacerdoti's NOAH <ref> [3] </ref> was the state of the art in planning. After several failed attempts to implement NOAH from it's description in the aformentioned reference, he succeeded in that he had a working planner. <p> What has been stressed throughout Chapman's work is rigor in all aspects of the implementation and discussion about his planner. Sacerdoti claims in <ref> [3] </ref> that "... it should be possible to define an algebra of plan transormations...a body of formal theory about the ways in which interacting subgoals can be dealt with." Chapman has accepted this challenge and his landmark paper is the result. 3.

Reference-contexts: I will not cover the details of his proof, I will only mention that he builds on the work of Warren (1974), Wald-inger <ref> (1975) </ref>, Rosenchein (1981), Kautz (1982), and Pednault (1985) who together prove the correctness of linear planners, and Sussmann (1973) who first put forward a 'loose' correctness argument.

Reference-contexts: This area of planning is known as 'metaplanning' and there has been some work done on it. Chapman notes that TWEAK could not be used as a metaplanner since it has an action representation that is too weak. Wilkins makes a brief statement about metaplanning in <ref> [7] </ref>. He says that "interesting (read valuable) metaplanning appears very difficult in a system that makes the Strips Assumption". Clearly this is an area that deserves some attention, although I have given it none in the course of this project.
