Abstract: We develop efficient deterministic algorithms for approximating the fraction of truth assignments that satisfy a disjunctive normal form formula. Although the algorithms themselves are deterministic, their analysis is probabilistic and uses the notion of limited independence between random variables. fl International Computer Science Institute, 1947 Center Street, Berkeley, California 94704 and Computer Science Department, UC Berkeley, research partially supported by NSF operating grant CCR-9016468 and by grant No. 89-00312 from the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF), Jerusalem, Israel.

Reference-contexts: Our proof works if D is only k-wise almost independent in a certain technical sense. This combined with the results of [15, Naor Naor] and <ref> [1, Alon Goldreich H-astad Peralta] </ref>, which produce such distributions with small sample spaces, yields a polynomial time approximation algorithm for Pr [F ] if t is bounded by a constant, a result previously obtained by [3, Ajtai Wigderson] by different means. <p> The size of the sample space is polynomial in log (n), 2 k and 1=*. The sample space can be constructed in time polynomial in its size. 5 Simpler constructions have subsequently been found by <ref> [1, Alon Goldreich H-astad Peralta] </ref>. We review one of their constructions, which is based on a result of [20, Weil] on character sums over finite fields. Suppose n is a positive integer and let p &gt; n be a prime. Let D be the uniform distribution on Z p . <p> The following lemma, due to [7, Even Goldreich Luby Nisan Velickovic], generalizes this to non-uniformly distributed random variables. Lemma 5 Given values fv 1 ; : : : ; v n g, where v i 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, there is an explicit construction of a sample space where f0; 1g-valued random variables fx 1 ; : : : ; x n g are k-wise *-dependent and non-uniformly distributed as follows: j Pr [x i = 1] v i j *.

Reference: [3] <author> Ajtai, M., Wigderson, A., </author> <title> "Deterministic Simulation of Probabilistic constant depth circuits", </title> <type> FOCS 85. </type>
Reference-contexts: A DNF formula is the special case when the depth of the circuit is two. <ref> [3, Ajtai Wigderson] </ref> describe a deterministic algorithm which given as input a constant depth circuit of size n and * &gt; 0 runs in time 2 n o (1) and produces an *-approximation of the probability that the output of the circuit is 1 when the input is randomly chosen. <p> An observation of [14, Luby Velickovic Wigderson] improves their analysis to yield c = 4 for the DNF problem. <ref> [3, Ajtai Wigderson] </ref> describe a polynomial time approximation algorithm for the DNF problem when t is a constant. <p> This combined with the results of [15, Naor Naor] and [1, Alon Goldreich H-astad Peralta], which produce such distributions with small sample spaces, yields a polynomial time approximation algorithm for Pr [F ] if t is bounded by a constant, a result previously obtained by <ref> [3, Ajtai Wigderson] </ref> by different means. The main contribution of this paper consists of the coloring algorithm. A proper k-coloring of F is a coloring of the variables of F using at most k colors such that no clause of F contains two variables of the same color. <p> We first derive an approximation algorithm for DNF formulas in the case that the maximum length of each clause is small. <ref> [3, Ajtai Wigderson] </ref> show that when the maximum clause length is constant there is an *-approximation algorithm with running time polynomial in nm and 1=*. We present a version of their algorithm which uses distributions with limited amount of independence. A similar analysis was found independently by Noam Nisan. <p> Because Pr [F ] 2 t , we can also conclude that j Pr [F ] Pr [F ]j 2 t (e t2 t + 2 l ffi) Pr [F ]: The following corollary is due to <ref> [3, Ajtai Wigderson] </ref>. We prove it using a different algorithm. Corollary 13 Let t be a fixed constant.

Reference-contexts: These difficulties motivate the goal of trying to find a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for approximating Pr [F ]. Towards this goal, [21, Yao] shows that if there are pseudo-random generators then any problem in RP can be approximated in subexponential time, and <ref> [5, Boppana, Hirschfeld] </ref> extends this result to show that any problem in BPP can be approximated in subexpo-nential time.

Reference-contexts: We then repeat this procedure until no large sunflowers can be found, obtaining a new formula F 0 . A theorem of Erdos-Rado <ref> [6] </ref> implies that at the end of this procedure there are not too many clauses in F 0 . <p> A family of sets S is called a sunflower if there is a set C, called the center, such that for every A; B 2 S if A 6= B then A " B = C.

Theorem 1 Let t and m be positive integers, and let F be a family of sets such that every element of F has size at most t and jF j &gt; t!(m 1) t .

Reference-contexts: Then, x i has equal probability of being 1 or -1. Mapping -1 to 1 and 1 to 0, we obtain f0; 1g-valued random variables which are *-biased for * = n= p.

Reference-contexts: For a fixed * this algorithm is faster than the algorithm in [16, Nisan Wigderson], but, unlike [16, Nisan Wigderson], the running time grows exponentially with 1=*. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present a reduction procedure implicit in <ref> [10, Karp Luby] </ref> which converts an absolute error approximation algorithm to a relative error approximation algorithm. This is important since in applications one is mainly interested in obtaining a relativized approximation of the probability that a formula is satisfied and this is typically very small. <p> On the other hand, there is no efficient relative error approximation algorithm for the CNF problem that is deterministic unless P = NP or that is probabilistic unless RP = NP. <ref> [10, Karp Luby] </ref>, [11, Karp Luby Madras] provide probabilistic algorithms which, given a DNF formula F , * &gt; 0 and ffi &gt; 0, compute Y that is an *-relative error approximation of Pr [F ] with probability at least 1 ffi.

Usually, the individual components are fairly reliable, in which case the failure probability p i of component i is small.

Reference-contexts: An observation of <ref> [14, Luby Velickovic Wigderson] </ref> improves their analysis to yield c = 4 for the DNF problem. [3, Ajtai Wigderson] describe a polynomial time approximation algorithm for the DNF problem when t is a constant. <p> This reduction can be combined with the algorithm from [16, Nisan Wigderson] (using the improvement based on an observation from <ref> [14, Luby Velickovic Wigderson] </ref>) to produce a polynomial time *-approximation for Pr [F ] when t = O (log 1=8 (nm)) and * is not too small. The second approach relies on special constructions of small probability distributions. <p> We now describe a slight modification of the algorithm from [16, Nisan Wigderson] due to <ref> [14, Luby Velickovic Wigderson] </ref>. The algorithm takes as input a DNF formula F with m clauses on n variables and * &gt; 0 and outputs an *-approximation of Pr [F ].

The size of the sample space of E is 2 O (log 4 ((nm)=*)) .

This combined with the results of <ref> [15, Naor Naor] </ref> and [1, Alon Goldreich H-astad Peralta], which produce such distributions with small sample spaces, yields a polynomial time approximation algorithm for Pr [F ] if t is bounded by a constant, a result previously obtained by [3, Ajtai Wigderson] by different means. <p> We say that P -valued random variables fx 1 ; : : : ; x n g over D are k-wise *-dependent (see [19, Vazirani], <ref> [15, Naor Naor] </ref>) provided for any subset I of f1; : : :; ng of size at most k and for every assignment : I ! P , j Pr [ i2I Y Pr [x i = (i)]j *: If * = 0 then the random variables are k-wise independent. <p> The sample space can be constructed in time polynomial in its size. The idea of relaxing the requirement from perfect k-wise independent to approximately k-wise independent distributions and the initial work on explicit constructions of small sample spaces that meet these relaxed requirements is due to <ref> [15, Naor Naor] </ref>. If f0; 1g-valued random variables are uniformly distributed we say that they are k-wise *-biased if for any subset I of f1; : : :; ng of size at most k, Pr [ i2I x i = 0] 1=2j *: [15, Naor Naor] present, for given n and <p> meet these relaxed requirements is due to <ref> [15, Naor Naor] </ref>.

If this conjecture were true in a slightly weaker form, i.e., if it were true with respect to distributions that are "almost" independent in the sense of <ref> [15, Naor Naor] </ref>, this would immediately imply yield a desired algorithm: construct D and compute Pr D [F ] in polynomial time, and this is provably a good approximation of Pr [F ]. Subsequently to our work Yishay Mansour found the following counterexample to this conjecture.

Reference-contexts: They also provide a polynomial time approximation algorithm for the DNF problem when the length of each clause is bounded by a constant. <ref> [16, Nisan Wigderson] </ref> improve this by giving an algorithm that has running time 2 log c (n=*) , where c is a constant that depends on the depth, and for the DNF problem c is approximately 12. <p> Because F 0 is so small, it turns out to be easier to approximate Pr [F 0 ], and because of the properties of the reduction this approximation is also a good approximation of Pr [F ]. This reduction can be combined with the algorithm from <ref> [16, Nisan Wigderson] </ref> (using the improvement based on an observation from [14, Luby Velickovic Wigderson]) to produce a polynomial time *-approximation for Pr [F ] when t = O (log 1=8 (nm)) and * is not too small.

Section 4 contains a review of the algorithm of <ref> [16, Nisan Wigderson] </ref> and then presents the sunflower reduction algorithm. These two algorithms are then combined to obtain the algorithm described above. <p> We now describe a slight modification of the algorithm from <ref> [16, Nisan Wigderson] </ref> due to [14, Luby Velickovic Wigderson].
