Abstract: This paper presents a survey of two-pass global illumination algorithms that use a local pass (gather) and shadow ray optimization techniques as well as a new two-pass algorithm which relies on spatial coherence to efficiently handle the problem of numerous luminaires. The algorithm presented operates on scenes with Lambertian reflectors and luminaires with arbitrary emission distributions. A radiosity prepass is performed on a simplified version of the scene. Bright reflecting surfaces are reclassified as light sources. A spatial data structure is then built that associates bright visible surfaces to regions in the environment. The visibility of these surfaces is probabilistically estimated. Finally, a view-dependent "gather" is performed at each pixel. This gather is made significantly more efficient than previous algorithms because of careful integration based on the contents of the spatial data structure.

However, a sufficient amount of computing time for Kajiya's algorithm is not practical for most rendering applications.

This has led to some speculation that global illumination is a solved problem [4]. <p> They also observed that gathering from nearby objects gives noticeable artifacts. To get around this, they used Monte Carlo path tracing <ref> [8] </ref> where large errors where expected from the gather method. In this paper, we introduce a two-pass algorithm: a ra-diosity prepass followed by a view-dependent "gather". The algorithm differs from previous two-pass methods; it is designed for environments with tens of thousand of primitives and hundreds of luminaires. <p> In Section 2.6 we review previous methods that can be directly applied to explicit gathers. 2.1 Rendering Equation We now examine the rendering equation for diffuse reflectors and general emitters. We review both the explicit (area-based) form presented by Kajiya <ref> [8] </ref>, and the implicit (directional) form presented by Immel [7]. <p> suggests the following algorithm 4 : color raycolor (ray, depth) color L = 0; if (ray hits at x) L += LE (x) if (depth &lt; maxDepth) L += R (x)*raycolor (randomRay, depth+1) return L else return background Because this is very inefficient for scenes with small bright sources, Kajiya <ref> [8] </ref> made the following modification (see Figure 2a): color raycolor (ray, depth) color L = 0; if (ray hits at x) if (depth == 0) L += LE (x) L += R (x) * directLight (x, N (x)) if (depth &lt; maxDepth) L += R (x)*raycolor (randomRay, depth+1) return L else <p> However, other methods may be preferred for scenes which contain few primary sources or scenes which contain numerous primary sources which are visible everywhere. 5.2 Error Our algorithm is no longer a pure Monte Carlo method (unlike <ref> [8, 22] </ref>), so our solution will have both noise and deterministic error. Note that almost all current methods are such hybrids; e.g., most visibility checks are Monte Carlo [20]. We have not made any analytical statements about the magnitude of this error in our results.

If E &lt; E i &lt; E then the influence region as in <ref> [17] </ref> is used to determine the cells in which l i may cause a probabilisticallyspike. Again, l i is inserted into a cell only if it is visible from the cell. <p> In our implementation the maximum number is 100. If g i = 0 then the light source is fully occluded and can be left out of the cell's spike list. The spike lists are sampled during the ray tracing pass according to the linear method from Shirley and Wang <ref> [17] </ref> with the geometry term included in the computation.

For this reason, recent work <ref> [18] </ref> suggests the use of spatial subdivision of light sources. The reasoning for this is that seldom are all lights important to every region in the environment. Therefore a list of important lights should vary in space.

Reference-contexts: In the event that the spike list is large, we will still only send one shadow ray for an explicit gather from all spikes, so even several hundred spikes should be allowable without too much degradation in performance. Because visibility calculation in complex scenes is very difficult <ref> [21] </ref>, we will use a point sample approach to visibility estimation, so we will falsely exclude some spikes. This amounts to truncation, but will never occur for spikes that are completely visible. 3.3 The Algorithm The algorithm performs the following steps, the first two are taken directly from GSII: 1. <p> A visibility variable g i is maintained which represents the percentage of rays which are not blocked. This is similar to the visibility estimate of Smits et al.[20]. This technique is not as accurate as the techniques presented by Teller and Hanrahan <ref> [21] </ref> but is applicable in "less well-behaved" environments. In our implementation we use a self-refining method which initially sends 10 rays, if each ray reaches the light source then g i is set to 1 and l i is inserted into the spike list.

Reference-contexts: Typically this is overkill because in many cases only a few light sources or patches are important to the illumination of the gather point. For direct lighting, Ward <ref> [24] </ref> suggested sorting the luminaires according to their contribution in descending order, sample the sources in order until the sum of the contributions is above some threshold, and then estimate the remaining contribution.

Reference-contexts: On the other end, algorithms are developed for practical use. Both of these efforts are worthwhile. Hopefully, the two ends will one day meet. In the mean time, those working on practical algorithms for complex scenes should be comparing their results with real environments as suggested by Ward <ref> [25] </ref>.
