Abstract: In this paper we address several variants of the polygon annulus placement problem: given an input polygon P and a set S of points, find an optimal placement of P that maximizes the number of points in S that fall in a certain annulus region defined by P and some offset distance ffi &gt; 0. We address the following variants of the problem: placement of a convex polygon as well as a simple polygon; placement by translation only, or by a translation and a rotation; off-line and on-line versions of the corresponding decision problems; and decision as well as optimization versions of the problems. We present efficient algorithms in each case.

Reference-contexts: These problems do not model important aspects for optimizing polygon placement (as mentioned in the applications above). Previous work directed at annulus problems, on the other hand, have dealt exclusively with circular annuli (see, e.g. <ref> [HT, LL, AST, AS, SJ, SLW, DGR] </ref>). These characterizations capture well the notion of "roundness" present in a set of points, but they do not easily extend to polygonal shape matching. 1.3 Definitions and Problems We start with definitions for convex polygons to simplify the presentation.

Reference-contexts: Our method involves a non-trivial extension of the roundness method of Duncan et al. [DGR] to offset polygons using the polygon-offset nearest-neighbor and furthest-neighbor diagrams <ref> [BDG] </ref>. Moreover, we show how to solve the optimization version of this problem in the same time bound, by using the simplest (and most practical) version of parametric searching. <p> For this purpose we define the convex polygon-offset distance-function D P that corresponds to P and compute the nearest- and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams of S with respect to D P (see <ref> [BDG] </ref>). This can be performed in O (n (log n + log m) + m) time. Next we use the method of [DGR] (where the authors minimize the width of a circular annulus) and consider the overlay of the two diagrams.

Reference-contexts: There are nevertheless several related problems that have been studied before, including variants directed at placing an entire polygon (not an annulus) to cover a set or subset of points (see, e.g., <ref> [ESZ, EE, BDP, DS] </ref>). These problems do not model important aspects for optimizing polygon placement (as mentioned in the applications above). Previous work directed at annulus problems, on the other hand, have dealt exclusively with circular annuli (see, e.g. [HT, LL, AST, AS, SJ, SLW, DGR]). <p> We also study the offset-polygon max-cover problem for convex polygons under translations, showing that this more-general problem can be solved in O (n 2 log (nm) + m) time and O (n + m) space. Our methods involve a nontrivial extension of the techniques of Barequet et al. <ref> [BDP] </ref>. In addition, we show how to solve this problem under translations and rotations by combining this approach with extensions of the rotation-diagram techniques of Dickerson and Scharstein [DS]. <p> We compute these intersections because they correspond to placements of the annulus region such that two (or more) points of S are in contact with the boundary of the annulus region. The following lemmas are generalizations of lemmas from <ref> [BDP, DS] </ref> that deal with intersections between two copies of the same polygon. Lemma 3. Let P be a convex polygon, q 1 ; q 2 points, and o 1 and o 2 the translations mapping the origin to points q 1 and q 2 , respectively. <p> Over all, the whole procedure requires O (n log n log m + m) time. 3.2 Offset-Polygon Max-Cover under Translation In this section we consider offset-polygon max-cover under translation. Our algorithm extends the techniques of Barequet et al. <ref> [BDP] </ref> to allow for containment within the annulus region rather than containment by the entire polygon. The idea is to do an anchored sweep of both the inner and outer offset polygons around each point of S.

(The intersection contains the loci of all feasible placements of the annulus so that it covers S.) This step takes O (n log m) time.

For each other point q j , the rotation diagram for q i includes the region of all such placements that contain q j . It is shown in <ref> [DS] </ref> that this containing region for q j can be decomposed into O (m 2 ) subregions of constant complexity. The left and right boundaries of these subregions are certain critical angles of rotation, where vertices of one polygon pass through edges of another. <p> Lemma 5. For convex polygons, the polygon annulus containing regions for a given point is decomposed into O (m 2 ) subregions each of which have constant complexity: vertical left and right boundaries and a sine curve for the top and bottom boundaries. The proofs of <ref> [DS] </ref> suffice to show that the upper and lower boundaries are still sine curves. The O (m 2 ) is a trivial upper bound which is attainable. There is however a constant factor increase in the complexity of the diagrams.

Reference-contexts: An instance of the tolerancing problem is to take a set of points representing an actual measurement of a manufactured object (using a coordinate-measuring machine, laser range-finder, or scanning electron microscope <ref> [DMSS] </ref>) and determine whether the manufactured object matches a polygon (the design) within some tolerance ffi &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: This problem is motivated by several applications. For example, in the robot localization problem (see, e.g., <ref> [GMR] </ref>), a robot should determine its current location in some environment map from a set of points obtained by a distance range sensor. Due to the inherent errors in range finding, the points usually do not define an exact match.

Reference-contexts: Thus the localization problem can be viewed as finding some optimal placement of the environment model (typically a polygon) with respect to the set of points and a distance ffi &gt; 0. A second application is a pattern matching problem arising in computer vision (see, e.g., <ref> [HU] </ref>), where the input consists of a set of points taken from some image and a pattern (polygon) that one would like to locate in this image.

Reference-contexts: Proof Omitted in this version of the paper. 2 The technique used in this proof also provides the necessary framework for the proof of the following lemma (using the tentative prune-and-search technique of Kirkpatrick and Snoeyink <ref> [KS] </ref>). Lemma 2. The intersections between offset polygons o (I P;ffi ) and O P;ffi can be found in worst case O (log m) time, where m is the number of vertices of P . <p> The preprocessing step requires O (m) time and space for computing and storing the offset polygons I = I P;ffi and O = O P;ffi . The offset polygons are stored such that later intersection tests can be performed in O (log m) time and space (see <ref> [KS] </ref> and Section 2). The steps inside the inner nested loop execute O (n 2 ) times.
