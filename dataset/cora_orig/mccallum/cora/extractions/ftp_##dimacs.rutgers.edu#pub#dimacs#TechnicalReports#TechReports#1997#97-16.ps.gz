Reference-contexts: This latter aspect of the result turns such an analysis into a version of the so-called multi-alignment of a set of proteins <ref> [1] </ref>. The version under consideration differs from the commonly adopted statement of the multi-alignment problem by the additional assumption that the set of the proteins is ordered, i.e. is a sequence. Below, in Section 4, we will discuss such a treatment of the multi-alignment problem in somewhat more detail. <p> The aim of multi-alignment is to show to the researcher what is in common in the analyzed set of proteins from the viewpoint of their amino-acid makeup. There exist several approaches to the problem of multi-alignment, but we refer here only to the pioneer work <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The elements of the pattern sequence take values from an appropriate set c 2 C that may be different from the set of original amino-acid residues and have the sense, for instance, of frequency distributions over Y <ref> [2, 5] </ref>, subclasses in it [6], or a functional descriptions of amino acid properties [2, 7]. <p> elements of the pattern sequence take values from an appropriate set c 2 C that may be different from the set of original amino-acid residues and have the sense, for instance, of frequency distributions over Y [2, 5], subclasses in it [6], or a functional descriptions of amino acid properties <ref> [2, 7] </ref>. However, the principal assumption of this work, that proteins forming the data set Y = (y j ; j = 1; : : : ; N ) are ordered into a chain, requires a substantial revision of the very notion of multi-alignment.

Reference-contexts: We briefly consider here the specificity of three of such problems <ref> [8] </ref>. <p> For this reason, it appears to be always preferable to set the problems of data analysis so that the separable objective functions to be minimized would be supported by trees. For the problems of image analysis, it was proposed in <ref> [8] </ref> to use several tree-supported objective functions to evaluate the goal variables at each of the vertical rows of the pixel grid of an image, conventionally, the vertical ones x t fl 1 = (x t fl ^ x t fl x t fl ( x t 1 ;t 2 2X

Reference-contexts: It is convenient to allow x t to take values from the two-dimensional real space X = R 2 , and, thereby, permit inter-pixel interpolation in the discrete image grid T <ref> [9] </ref>.
