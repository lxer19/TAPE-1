Abstract: Multimedia applications comprise of several media streams, which are semantically synchronized at different time instants. The application behavior is stored along with the multimedia database using representation mechanisms such as OCPN (Object Composition Petri Nets) or Dynamic Timed Petri Nets (DTPN). It is imperative that one translates the application behavior to the corresponding schedulable entities, such as packets, so that the performance engineering of any system can be done, using the traffic model arising out of the (media related) application behavior as opposed to individual media level behavior. This requires that a function be defined, which takes the stored temporal representation as input and produces packets as output, preserving the semantic relationships among the streams. We propose a methodology based on Probabilistic, Attributed Context Free Grammar (PACFG) to address this issue. We demonstrate the appropriateness of this methodology by applying it to the OCPN/DTPN representation of a typical multimedia application viz., orchestrated presentation.

Reference-contexts: Object-oriented techniques also have been used for describing the components comprising the presentation and their temporal relationships [6, 10]. Another approach is to describe the storage representation of the temporal relations in orchestrated presentation. Petri nets <ref> [1] </ref> based models have been suggested in [5, 7, 8, 11] for this purpose.

Reference-contexts: that Context Free Grammars either with attribute or stochastic specifications have been successfully used for description of workload models for communication system and for description of workload in a client-server environment in [14]. 5 Operational Behavior Model Using PACFG Context Free Grammars (CFG) have the inherent property of generating sequences <ref> [2] </ref>. Probabilistic Context Free Grammars (PCFG) are capable of generating sequences which exhibit random behavior such as the randomness in user interactions during a multimedia presentation.

Reference-contexts: Given any two distinct events occurring in time, there are thirteen ways in which they can be related <ref> [3] </ref>. These relations describe how the events are related in time according to their start time and end time. The thirteen relations can be represented by a total of seven cases since the six others are inverses, with the equality relation having no inverse.

The serialize-net algorithm simulates the OCPN by following the set of firing rules defined. <p> Applying the serialize-net algorithm in <ref> [8] </ref> for the OCPN of Figure 4 (v), the time instances of presentations of objects a, b and the null object are (t1, t1, t1+d2). Similarly, the durations of presentations of the objects a, b and the null object are (d1, d2, t0).

Reference-contexts: This algorithm can be made as part of the attribute functions to derive the time and durations of presentation of the different objects in the multimedia presentation. The productions rules have associated functions for handling user inputs which modify the sequence of windows, objects and frames. In <ref> [12] </ref>, a set of functions have been defined for handling user interactions in an orchestrated presentation. These functions basically help in identifying the next set of objects to be delivered after an user input or estimate the change in time scale after the input, as the case may be. <p> These functions basically help in identifying the next set of objects to be delivered after an user input or estimate the change in time scale after the input, as the case may be.
