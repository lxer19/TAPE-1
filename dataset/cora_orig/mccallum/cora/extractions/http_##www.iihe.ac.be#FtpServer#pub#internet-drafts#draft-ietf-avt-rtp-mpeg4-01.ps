Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress." Abstract This document describes a payload format for transporting MPEG-4 encoded data using RTP. MPEG-4 is a recent standard from ISO/IEC for the coding of natural and synthetic audiovisual data. Several services provided by RTP are beneficial for MPEG-4 encoded data transport over the Internet. Additionally, the use of RTP makes it possible to synchronize MPEG-4 data with other real-time data types. This specification is a product of the Audio/Video Transport working group within the Internet Engineering Task Force and ISO/IEC MPEG-4 ad hoc group on MPEG-4 over Internet. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at rem-conf@es.net and/or the authors.

The Compression Layer processes individual audiovisual media streams. The MPEG-4 compression schemes are defined in the ISO/IEC specifications 14496-2 <ref> [2] </ref> and 14496-3 [3]. The compression schemes in MPEG-4 achieve efficient encoding over a bandwidth ranging from several Kbps to many Mbps. The audiovisual content compressed by this layer is organized into Elementary Streams (ESs). The MPEG-4 standard specifies MPEG-4 compliant streams.

Reference-contexts: The interface between the compression layer and the SL is called the Elementary Stream Interface (ESI). The ESI is informative. The Delivery Layer in MPEG-4 consists of the Delivery Multimedia Integration Framework defined in ISO/IEC 14496-6 <ref> [4] </ref>. This layer is media unaware but delivery technology aware. It provides transparent access to and delivery of content irrespective of the technologies used. The interface between the SL and DMIF is called the DMIF Application Interface (DAI).

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction MPEG-4 is a recent standard from ISO/IEC for the coding of natural and synthetic audiovisual data in the form of audiovisual objects that are arranged into an audiovisual scene by means of a scene description [1][2][3][4]. This draft specifies an RTP <ref> [5] </ref> payload format for transporting MPEG-4 encoded data streams. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [6]. <p> When unpacking the RTP packet this process can be reversed with the knowledge of the SLConfigDescriptor and by evaluating the compositionTimeStampFlag. Timestamps are recommended to start at a random value for security reasons <ref> [5, Section 5.1] </ref>. SSRC: set as described in RFC1889 [5]. A mapping between the ES identifiers (ESIDs) and SSRCs should be provided through out-of-band means. CC and CSRC fields are used as described in RFC 1889 [5]. <p> When unpacking the RTP packet this process can be reversed with the knowledge of the SLConfigDescriptor and by evaluating the compositionTimeStampFlag.

Multiplexing Since a typical MPEG-4 session may involve a large number of objects, that may be as many as a few hundred, transporting each ES as an individual RTP session may not always be practical. <p> The multiplexing scheme should be able to delineate the multiplexed packets whose lengths may vary from a few bytes to close to the path-MTU. 5. Security Considerations RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP specification <ref> [5] </ref>. This implies that confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by encryption.
