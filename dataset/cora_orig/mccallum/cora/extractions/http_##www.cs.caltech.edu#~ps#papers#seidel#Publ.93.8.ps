Abstract: This paper studies geometrically continuous spline curves of arbitrary degree. Based on the concept of universal splines we obtain geometric constructions for both the spline control points and for the Bezier points and give algorithms for computing locally supported basis functions and for knot insertion. The geometric constructions are based on the intersection of osculating flats. The concept of universal splines is defined in such a way that these intersections are guaranteed to exist. As a result of this development we obtain a generalization of polar forms to geometrically continuous spline curves by intersecting osculating flats. The presented algorithms have been coded in Maple, and concrete examples illustrate the approach.

Reference-contexts: Note that for n = 3 the knot insertion algorithm in [10] is a special case of Algorithm 7.1. If ^ S is parametrically C k -continuous, the functions a i (u) become affine in u, and Algorithm 7.1 reduces to the insertion algorithm <ref> [9] </ref> for B-splines. Similar to our results in the previous sections, the output of Algorithm 7.1 is again affinely invariant. Therefore the results of Algorithm 7.1 not only hold for universal splines, but carry over to any spline F in S (T; C).

In addition, it can be shown that ^s is affine in every argument. Therefore ^s is the polar form or blossom of ^ S <ref> [56] </ref>. Unfortunately, these definitions break down if the polynomial F is degenerate in the sense that its Bezier points are affinely dependent.
