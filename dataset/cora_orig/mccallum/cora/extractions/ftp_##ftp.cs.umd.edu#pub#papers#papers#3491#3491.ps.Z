Abstract: Maximizing bandwidth utilization and providing performance guarantees, in the context of multimedia networking, are two incompatible goals. Heterogeneity of the multimedia sources calls for effective traffic control schemes to satisfy their diverse Quality of Service(QoS) requirements. These include admission control at connection set up, traffic control at the source ends and efficient scheduling schemes at the switches. The emphasis in this paper is on traffic control at the source end. Most multimedia sources are bursty in nature. Traffic shapers have been mainly studied hitherto from the point of view of their effectiveness in smoothing the burstiness. Leaky Bucket(LB) scheme, to cite an example, is a mean rate policer smoothing at the token generation rate. Studies on bursty sources show that burstiness promotes statistical multiplexing at the cost of possible congestion. Smoothing, on the other hand, helps in providing guarantees at the cost of utilization. Thus need for a flexible scheme which can provide a reasonable compromise between utilization and performance is imminent. Recent studies [10, 12] have also questioned the suitability of LB for policing real-time traffic due to the excessive delays. We argue for a policy which is less stringent on short term burstiness than the LB. We propose a new traffic shaper which can adjust the burstiness of the input traffic to obtain reasonable bandwidth utilization while maintaining statistical service guarantees. The performance study is conducted in two parts. In the first part, we study the effect of varying the shaper parameters on the input characteristics. In the second part, we dimension our scheme and a LB equivalently and compare the mean and peak rate policing behavior with delay and loss as the performance parameters. Adopting a less stringent attitude towards short term burstiness is shown to result in considerable advantage while policing real-time traffic. Future research possibilities in this topic are explored.

Reference-contexts: A simple implementation of the scheme using 2 windows is outlined in the following section. 5.2 Description of the new scheme The Shift Register Traffic Shaper (SRTS) makes use of the temporal profile <ref> [1] </ref> of the packet stream admitted by the shaper over the immediate past N time slots, where a time slot t refers to the reciprocal of the peak rate. This temporal history can be maintained by a shift register with 1 bit corresponding to every packet sent.

Reference-contexts: An allocation nearer to the peak rate allows providing tighter probabilistic guarantees. In the extreme, with peak rate allotment, the guarantees can be deterministic. 2.2 Bursty Model and Bandwidth Requirement The source model that is used for measuring performance is the ON-OFF bursty model <ref> [2, 17, 19] </ref>. On-Off model is characterized by interspersed ON and OFF periods each exponentially distributed with mean T ON and T OF F respectively. During an ON period, cells are periodically transmitted at peak rate p (intercell time during an ON period is t p = 1= p ).

An allocation corresponding to the effective bandwidth optimizes the network utilization and performance guarantees.

Reference-contexts: This assumption will result in an Interrupted Poisson Process (IPP). Further generalizations will lead to 2-state and n-state Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP) models <ref> [8] </ref>. In this paper, we use an ON-OFF bursty model for the source.

Reference-contexts: Since the output stream is of an arbitrary nature unlike the input stream which is described by a bursty ON-OFF model parameters, we use ratio of Variance to Mean of cell interarrival times <ref> [9, 16] </ref> for characterizing the burstiness. We will use the term "burst factor" for this ratio to differentiate this definition of burstiness from the definition given in Section2.2. Figure 7a presents the result for 2 source ON-OFF characteristics.

The total delay experienced by a cell is the sum of the access delay due to queuing at the shaper and the network delay at the switch. The policer simply transfers the network delay on to the input side thereby avoiding overflow losses/delays within the network. <p> For many real time applications, this access delay could be prohibitive. 2. A stringent input rate control may unnecessarily increase the user end-to-end delay by a significant amount [12]. 3. The minimum total average delay is achieved when no traffic enforcement is invoked <ref> [10, 12] </ref>. This observation is applicable when the network bandwidth is considerably greater than the source transmission rate, in which case the effect of individual streams is smoothed by statistical multiplexing. Nevertheless, to check excessive burstiness and prolonged rate violations, input policer is practically needed.

Reference-contexts: A performance comparison among these schemes from the point of view of violation probability, sensitivity to overloads, dynamic reaction time and worst case traffic admitted into the network can be found in <ref> [11] </ref>. It has been shown that the LB and the EWMA are the most promising mechanisms to cope with short-term fluctuations and hence suited for policing bursty traffic. Several improvements of the LB has been proposed for increasing utilization in an ATM environment [3, 5, 15]. <p> These characteristics motivated the development of the scheme proposed in this paper. A brief description of EWMA, a window based policer is also given for comparison with the proposed scheme. 3.1 Leaky Bucket Scheme Leaky Bucket [18] and its variant schemes are described in <ref> [3, 5, 11, 15] </ref>. In a generalized model of the leaky bucket shown in Figure 1, tokens are generated at a fixed rate as long as the token buffer of size b is not full. <p> In terms of the smoothness definition given in Section 2.3, we can state that for any T starting from 0 (or from any epoch when token buffer is empty), LBP output is (n t ,T ) smooth. 3.2 Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Scheme EWMA is a window based scheme <ref> [11] </ref> where the maximum number of cells permitted within a fixed time window is limited. <p> A nonzero value of fl permits more burstiness. For a value of fl = 0:8, up to 5 times N number of packets can occur in the first window. Thus a large value of fl increases the reaction time and it is shown in <ref> [11] </ref> that the dynamic behavior of EWMA is the worst. Moreover, the implementation complexity of this scheme is higher than LB and other window based schemes. 4 Shaping and BW Allocation The bandwidth that needs to be allocated to the shaped stream depends on the shaper parameters. <p> SRTS is a mean as well as a peak rate policer. In the two experiments, we assume an overdimensioning factor C = 1:5 relating the policed rate and the mean rate of the source (as in <ref> [11] </ref>). The peak enforced rate is 100 and hence the minimum delay between consecutive packets at the output of the shaper t is 10 ms.

Reference-contexts: Thus the responsibility of preventing congestion lies with the admission control and traffic enforcement schemes. Some of the admission control, resource reservation and scheduling schemes proposed for integrated broad band networks in the recent past and the related issues are surveyed in a previous paper <ref> [13] </ref>. Admission control restricts the number of connections that can be supported by the network. Admission control is decided by an algorithm which expects that the user provides an estimate of the traffic parameters and abides by their negotiated values.

Reference-contexts: We will refer to the new scheme as the SRTS (Shift Register Traffic Shaper). A single sliding window mechanism for traffic shaping was incorporated for traffic regulation by Rigolo and Fratta in <ref> [14] </ref>. In that paper, the shaper consisted of a sliding window followed by a server operating at a constant rate. Our scheme employs more than one window, which jointly provide a more general control over the burstiness of the input stream.
