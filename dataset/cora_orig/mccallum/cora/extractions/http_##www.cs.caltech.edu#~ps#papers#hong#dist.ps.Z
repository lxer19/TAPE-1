Reference-contexts: a function f is axially convex if it is convex in any direction parallel to the edges of the simplex (see [35] and the references therein), i.e., f (tx 1 + (1 t)x 2 ) tf (x 1 ) + (1 t)f (x 2 ) holds for every t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and any x 1 ; x 2 such that x 1 x 2 = (v i v j ), for some 0 i &lt; j s and some 2 IR. <p> As a consequence of the theorem in this final section, we see that the space S 1 4 () has the optimal approximation order, provided that the degree of every vertex of is either 4 or an odd integer. 4. 1. A Local Refinement of Triangulations In <ref> [1] </ref>, an interpolation scheme on the well-known bivariate Clough-Tocher element is derived by using the B-net approach and the same techniques are employed for the derivation of a trivariate Clough-Tocher scheme. The bivariate Clough-Tocher scheme uses the function data and the gradients at the vertices of a general triangle.

Reference-contexts: For instance, bivariate spline functions are useful in representing a mathematical model described by several parameters and in the interpretation of two-dimensional data sets. Bivariate splines are also widely used in Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) such as surface fitting (see, e.g., <ref> [2] </ref>, [42], [43], [59], [60], etc.). For these and other reasons, we are interested in the following aspects of the spaces S r k (): (1) Algebraic structures (dimensions, locally supported bases); Journal model is Journal of Approximation Theory. 2 (2) Approximation properties (explicit interpolation schemes and approxima tion orders).

Reference-contexts: Alfeld and Schumaker [5] extended the Morgan-Scott result for all r by showing that Schumaker's lower bound is in fact the dimension of S r k () when k 4r + 1. Together with Piper <ref> [3] </ref>, they constructed explicit bases for these spaces. By a clever application of the B-net approach, they also extended the Morgan-Scott results to the space S 1 4 () (see [4]).

Reference-contexts: Together with Piper [3], they constructed explicit bases for these spaces. By a clever application of the B-net approach, they also extended the Morgan-Scott results to the space S 1 4 () (see <ref> [4] </ref>). By carefully working with the smoothness conditions in terms of B-net representation of spline functions, it was proved in [47] that Schumaker's lower bound is indeed the dimension for the spaces S r k () when k 3r + 2. <p> Recall that an interior vertex which has only two edges with different slopes attached to it is called a singular vertex. Let denote the number of singular vertices in . Then we have (see <ref> [4] </ref>) dim (S 1 For the refined triangulation ^ , it is clear that the number of singular vertices in ^ remains the same as that in . <p> Here, we use b t to denote the transpose of the matrix b. Since the determinant of the coefficient matrix M has full column rank (see <ref> [4] </ref>, Lemma 5), it follows that all the B-net ordinates in D 2 u must vanish. This completes the proof of the lemma. Lemma 4. 4. Suppose that an interior even degree vertex u has degree deg (u) 6.

Ibrahim and Schumaker [48] 3 extended the results in [47] to super spline spaces. From a different point of view, Billera <ref> [10] </ref> developed a homological approach to this problem. He uses techniques from algebraic homology and rigidity theory to obtain certain formulas for the generic dimensions of the spaces S 1 k (), k 2. This work is based on Whiteley's solution of the spline matrix problem (see [69]). <p> If St (v)nfvg is connected for every vertex v of , then is called strongly connected (see <ref> [10] </ref>). If is strongly connected, then each boundary vertex has exactly two boundary edges attached to it. For simplicity, we will always assume that is strongly connected, though our discussion is also valid otherwise.

Reference-contexts: For this purpose, explicit bases for the spaces S r k () are set up when k 3r + 2 and an approximation scheme using such bases to achieve the optimal order of approximation is discussed in [46]. Chui and Lai <ref> [28] </ref> gave a basis of vertex splines for the super spline spaces S r; k (), where r + b k2r1 2 c and k 3r + 2. <p> They also constructed an approximation scheme by using this super vertex spline basis to prove that the super spline subspace of the space S r k () already achieves the full order of approximation. Nevertheless, the estimation constant in (1. 1) obtained by such schemes presented in [46] and <ref> [28] </ref>, not only depends on the smallest angle of , but also the measurement of the near-singularity of , i.e., the constant becomes large for near singular vertices. <p> Instability Considerations In this section, we recall the previous approaches for constructing certain bases of the space S r k () when k 3r + 2 (see [47], [48], and <ref> [28] </ref>) and investigate the instability of these bases. For convenience, we only consider the subspace S r; with k 3r + 2 and = b 3r+1 2 c. Throughout this chapter, we assume that is pure, that is, each maximal simplex has dimension 2. <p> Based on the previous work (see [3|6], [12], [46|48] and <ref> [28] </ref>, etc.), in constructing an appropriate subset of X such that becomes a minimally determining set, the point set X is divided into subsets such that the corresponding 32 linear functionals in two disjoint subsets are linear independent from each other. <p> Fig. 3. 15. Support of a basis function B x in S 3;5 66 Compared with the results in <ref> [28] </ref>, [47] and [48] concerning the support of the basis functions of S r; k (), we see that the support of B x , x 2 Y , usually is larger than the support of the basis functions defined in Section 3. 1, which are contained in the 1-star of <p> Hence, the number k = 3r + 2 is sharp in the sense that the spline space S r k () achieves the optimal approximation order of k + 1. 70 2. The main difference between our approach and the previous attempts in <ref> [28] </ref> and [46] is that a total set Y n u for X n u with the property that assertion (3. 42) holds for all x 2 Y n u ; n = + 1; : : : ; 2r is obtained by applying (3. 32).

Reference-contexts: Since all the points in fx ff;t : jffj = kg on a triangle t 2 form a set of principal lattices (see <ref> [34] </ref>), there exists a unique Lagrange interpolant on fx ff;t : jffj = kg. Thus, the coefficient matrix (B ff;t (x fi;t )) jffj=k jfij=k is invertible.
