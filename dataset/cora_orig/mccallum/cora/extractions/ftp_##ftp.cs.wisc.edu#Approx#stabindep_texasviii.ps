Abstract: Due to their so-called time-frequency localization properties, wavelets have become a powerful tool in signal analysis and image processing. Typical constructions of wavelets depend on the stability of the shifts of an underlying refinable function 2 L 2 (lR d ). In this paper, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the shifts of certain compactly supported refinable functions. These conditions are in terms of the zeros of the refinement mask. We also provide a similar characterization of the (global) linear independence of the shifts. In this paper we present a characterization of the stability and linear independence of the shifts of a compactly supported refinable function in terms of the refinement mask. Our results are applicable to a large class of mul-tivariate functions which includes (but is not limited to) tensor products and box splines. A function 2 L p (lR d ) is said to have ` p -stable shifts if there exist positive constants C and D such that x1 Introduction
