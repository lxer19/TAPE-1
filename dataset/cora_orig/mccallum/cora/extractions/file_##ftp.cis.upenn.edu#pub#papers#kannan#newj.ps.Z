Title: A quasi-polynomial-time algorithm for sampling words from a context-free language  
Author: Vivek Gore Mark Jerrum Sampath Kannan Z. Sweedyk Steve Mahaney 
Date: July 8, 1995  
Abstract: A quasi-polynomial-time algorithm is presented for sampling almost uniformly at random from the n-slice of the language L(G) generated by an arbitrary context-free grammar G. (The n-slice of a language L over an alphabet is the subset L " n of words of length exactly n.) The time complexity of the algorithm is " 2 (n jGj) O(logn) , where the parameter " bounds the variation of the output distribution from uniform, and jGj is a natural measure of the size of grammar G. The algorithm applies to a class of language sampling problems that includes slices of context-free languages as a proper subclass.

Reference-contexts: The n-slice of L is just the subset L " n containing all words in L of length n. The problem of determining the size of the n-slice of L (G) is #P-complete <ref> [1] </ref>, and remains so even when the grammar G is restricted to be regular. This completeness result does not, however, rule out the possibility of efficient sampling from slices of context-free languages, nor efficient estimation of the size of slices.
