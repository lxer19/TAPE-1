Abstract: Artificial neural networks have been applied to the prediction of splice site location in human pre-mRNA. A joint prediction scheme where prediction of transition regions between introns and exons regulates a cutoff level for splice site assignment was able to predict splice site locations with confidence levels far better than previously reported in the literature. The problem of predicting donor and acceptor sites in human genes is hampered by the presence of numerous amounts of false positives | in the paper the distribution of these false splice sites is examined and linked to a possible scenario for the splicing mechanism in vivo. When the presented method detects 95% of the true donor and acceptor sites it makes less than 0.1% false donor site assignments and less than 0.4% false acceptor site assignments. For the large data set used in this study this means that on the average there are one and a half false donor sites per true donor site and six false acceptor sites per true acceptor site. With the joint assignment method more than a fifth of the true donor sites and around one fourth of the true acceptor sites could be detected without accompaniment of any false positive predictions. Highly confident splice sites could not be isolated with a widely used weight matrix method or by separate splice site networks. A complementary relation between the confidence levels of the coding/non-coding and the separate splice site networks was observed, with many weak splice sites having sharp transitions in the coding/non-coding signal and many stronger splice sites having more ill-defined transitions between coding and non-coding.

Reference-contexts: problem of classifying pieces of DNA sequence according to their function as translated exon, intron, untranslated exon or other alternatives has been addressed by several methods (von Heijne, 1987), primarily either based on the compilation of tables of codon usage (Staden, 1984b), or detection of local nonrandomness in the sequence <ref> (Fickett, 1982) </ref>. This problem is far easier when sequence segments are "pure" (Lapedes, 1988), that is, when they in their entirety stem from one specific class only.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Splice site selection in vertebrate pre-mRNA's <ref> (see Green, 1986 for a review) </ref> involves small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP's) recognising sequences around the exon-intron borders; U1 snRNP's recognise 5' (donor) sites (Mount et al., 1983; Zhuang & Weiner, 1986) and U2 and U5 snRNP's interact with the 3' end of the intron (Chabot et al., 1985; Krainer & Maniatis,

Reference-contexts: The consensus of the 5' site was found to be C A AG/GT G A AGT (Mount, 1982), whereas the 3' site and the branch point are weakly defined by a consensus sequence <ref> (Harris & Senapathy, 1990) </ref> and seem to be specified by an intervening polypyrimidine tract characterised by the strict absence of AG dinucleotides (Smith et al., 1989; Mengeritsky & Smith, 1989).

Reference-contexts: The average length of internal exons was 200 bp, whereas the average length of terminal exons was as large as 649 bp.

The human and chicken genes have a rather low degree of sequence similarity in this region. The network assigns position 3949 as splicing acceptor.

Reference-contexts: If more information was included in the scoring scheme: open reading frames, free energy of base pairing between the snRNP and the mRNA, as well as coding statistics, the prediction of single introns did rise to about 80% <ref> (Nakata et al., 1985) </ref>. Simple neural network algorithms have been employed in the recognition of 3' and 5' sites as well as coding regions (Lapedes et al., 1988).

Reference-contexts: Thus the recognition of 3' and 5' splice sites around internal exons may be a concerted process in which the exon length is an important factor. It has been demonstrated that position effects are involved in splice site selection <ref> (Nelson & Green, 1988) </ref>. A model of exon recognition would imply recognition of initial and terminal exons (which lack the 3' and 5' site, respectively) by separate processes.

Reference-contexts: Mutations at the 5' site either activate a nearby cryptic site (Treisman et al., 1983) or, if no suitable cryptic site can be located in close proximity, cause exon skipping by abolishing splicing at the 3' site of the upstream intron as well <ref> (Orkin, 1987) </ref>. The latter observation of exon skipping seems to indicate some functional coordination in the recognition of the 3' and 5' sites that surround an exon.

Reference-contexts: Numerous experiments have addressed the question of necessary and sufficient sequence conditions for proper selection of splice sites. Deletion of large intron parts seems to have no effect on the selection <ref> (Wieringa et al., 1984) </ref>, whereas mutation or duplication of splice sites often alters splice site selection (Krainer et al., 1990; Kuhne et al., 1983). Mutation of the 3' splice site appears to have an effect only when the most conserved AG dinucleotide is involved (Reed & Maniatis, 1986).
