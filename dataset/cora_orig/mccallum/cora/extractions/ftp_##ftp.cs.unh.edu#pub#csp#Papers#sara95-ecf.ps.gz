Reference-contexts: We will focus here on binary CSPs, where constraints specify pairs of allowable values. Abstraction and reformulation are fundamental, powerful ideas in artificial intelligence, but they have not had a great deal of application in the area of constraint satisfaction (see <ref> [ Ellman, 1993; Nadel, 1990 ] </ref> for recent important exceptions). The obvious way to implement abstraction in a constraint satisfaction context is to simplify the problem by removing constraints, and then use the solutions to the simplified problem to guide the search for a solution to the original problem.

Reference-contexts: Thus there may be too many solutions to the simplified problem to be useful. The Cartesian product representation [ Hubbe and Freuder, 1992 ] and interchangeability <ref> [ Freuder, 1991 ] </ref> techniques provide ways of working with compact representations of large sets of solutions. Interchangeability provides a principled approach to problem reformulation. Values are interchangeable if exchanging one for one another in any solution produces another solution. Interchangeable values form equivalence classes.
