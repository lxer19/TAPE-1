Reference-contexts: Tracking, which is a central component in temporal registration, has been addressed by using lines [Lowe 92, Crowley 90, Sawhney 92], edges [Gennery 92] including edge contours [Dickinson 94, Kass 88] and intensity [Uenohara 95, Hager 94, Shi 94] including optic flow <ref> [Anandan 89] </ref>. For example Crow-ley [Crowley 90] used a set of parameterized line tokens which were matched to predicted feature vectors using the Mahalanobis distance. Sawhney [Sawhney 92] extended this approach to triples of lines, grouped under the shallow structure assumption under affine transformations. <p> Other model-based tracking such as Hager [Hager 94] uses a hierarchy of features to represent a model. Constraints on the state of the feature are propagated down the hierarchy and at the lowest level tracking is accomplished using convolutions (edges) or SSD methods <ref> [Anandan 89] </ref>. Hager does not explicitly address the issue of mismatches as is done by Shi and To-masi [Shi 94]. Affine feature dissimilarity over multiple frames is used to identify good features to track.

Reference-contexts: Affine feature dissimilarity over multiple frames is used to identify good features to track. This method is image based, while ours is model based and can detect outliers after just one frame. Although the use of aspect graphs is not new (e.g. <ref> [Bowyer 91, Ikeuchi 88] </ref>), most systems do not use coarse quantizations of the view sphere as employed in this system. 4 Registration System Components In this section we describe each of the system components individually, paying particular attention to the tracking module which contains novel elements (the pose determination module is

Reference-contexts: Our technique is different from all these approaches in that it uses both intensity and edge information for tracking, and uses robust computation to detect mismatches in tracking.

Reference-contexts: Under these assumptions the correlation measure is normalized in that it is independent of the illumination incident on the surface. However, good experimental results have been obtained with this measure on surfaces that do not fit the Lambertian assumption (see <ref> [Fennema 91] </ref> for a derivation. Normalized cross-correlation degrades when there is a relative rotation between the templates and image patches. To compensate for 2D rotations it is sufficient to note that equation 1 is linear shift invariant in cartesian space and hence is translation invariant.

Reference-contexts: In the first approach, a median-filter is used to detect and exclude outliers during pose computation pose. The second approach is to use maximum likelihood estimation (M-estimation) of pose. In this paper an iterative re-weighting least squares (IRLS) form of M-estimation, namely, the modified weights method proposed by <ref> [Huber 81] </ref>, is used. One important result of the interaction of the pose and tracking components is system stability. Errors can be produced both during tracking and pose computation. Tracking errors arise when the template localizes incorrectly for reasons such as specularity or large inter-frame motions. <p> NCC-R, for example, can produce a high correlation score at mismatches and thus a threshold will not work. We have experimented with two alternative robust statistical methods for pose computation. The first is an IRLS technique, in particular one proposed by Huber as the modified weights method <ref> [Huber 81] </ref>. Using this method, the weights associated with each model-data pair are iteratively re-computed, so that outliers are simultaneously detected as the robust pose is computed. Upon convergence, a maximum likelihood estimate (M-estimate) of pose is produced.

Reference-contexts: So long as the actual feature is within the search window, un-occluded and free from specular reflections in the image, the tracker locates features correctly. Pose computation <ref> [Kumar 92] </ref> uses camera parameters and the model-image correspondences to robustly solve for a rotation and translation that minimizes the projection error 4 of model points on the object in to the image plane. Robust pose estimates are obtained by using two alternative approaches. <p> systems do not use coarse quantizations of the view sphere as employed in this system. 4 Registration System Components In this section we describe each of the system components individually, paying particular attention to the tracking module which contains novel elements (the pose determination module is as presented by Kumar <ref> [Kumar 92] </ref>, and the feature indexing module is quite simple). 4.1 Tracking The tracking module localizes a set of feature templates in a newly acquired image given hypothesized 2D feature locations. <p> The pose estimation module uses Kumar's algorithm <ref> [Kumar 92] </ref> to solve for the rotation and translation that maps a set of 3D model points onto corresponding 2D image points. Kumar's algorithm is an iterative approach that minimizes the squared image-plane distance from the data points to the projected model points. <p> Upon convergence, a maximum likelihood estimate (M-estimate) of pose is produced. We use a variation adopted by Kumar where the weighting function takes the form of Tukey's bi-weight re-descending function <ref> [Kumar 92] </ref>. The IRLS technique (and other M-estimation techniques as well) is an excellent choice for the pose computation module of the registration system. Its asymptotic complexity is comparable to least mean squares but, in practice, IRLS tends to converge slower than least mean squares. <p> The third source of variance is pose computation error. As shown in simulation studies by Kumar <ref> [Kumar 92] </ref>, the residual pose error resulting from 7 For the experiments in this paper, the feature index table encompassed a viewing hemisphere, since the object is not visible from below the table. simple noise in the positions of point features is very small for most images.

Reference-contexts: Accuracy is traded for speed to a certain degree in the real-time applications we have investigated, and sampling is performed without interpolation. NCC-R can be used to track token features such as lines, curves and corners <ref> [Ravela 95] </ref>; the system described here tracks corners. The performance of rotation compensated normalized cross-correlation (NCC-R) is observed to be much better in terms of 2D rotational tolerance.
