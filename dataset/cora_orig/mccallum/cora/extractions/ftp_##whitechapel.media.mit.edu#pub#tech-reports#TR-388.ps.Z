Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 388 Appears: Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, October, 1996 Abstract A method for the recovery of the temporal structure and phases in natural gesture is presented. The work is motivated by recent developments in the theory of natural gesture which have identified several key aspects of gesture important to communication. In particular, gesticulation during conversation can be coarsely characterized as periods of bi-phasic or tri-phasic gesture separated by a rest state. We first present an automatic procedure for hypothesizing plausible rest state configurations of a speaker; the method uses the repetition of subsequences to indicate potential rest states. Second, we develop a state-based parsing algorithm used to both select among candidate rest states and to parse an incoming video stream into bi-phasic and multi-phasic gestures. We present results from exam ples of story-telling speakers.

Reference-contexts: This usually proceeds by collecting a number of examples of the gesture, computing the "mean gesture" and quantifying the variance seen in the examples. The hope is that this description will generalize to the actual test data. Examples of this approach include <ref> [9, 1, 13, 4, 10] </ref>. This typical pattern recognition approach may be well suited to the recognition of stylized or literal gesture, such as the gestures made by a user navigating aeronautical data in a virtual reality system by contorting their hands.

Reference-contexts: Thus, 1 these gestures may be termed "tri-phasic." What it means for a movement of the hands to be a "natural gesture" is defined, at least in part, by these temporal characteristics. The bi-phasic and tri-phasic distinction is introduced in <ref> [2] </ref>. The distinction between beats and representational gestures (iconic and metaphoric) is also discussed in [11]. In this paper we employ the above descriptions to derive a parsing mechanism sensitive to the temporal structure of natural gesture.

Reference-contexts: We present results from two extended examples of story-telling speakers. 2 Gesture in Communication Recent research in the field of natural gesture generation and parsing has identified four basic types of gesture generated during discourse <ref> [6, 3] </ref>. Three of these are considered to have meaning in a dialog: iconic, where the motion or configuration of the hands physically match the object or situation of narration; deictic, a pointing gesture; metaphoric, where the motion or shape of the hands is somehow suggestive of the situation.

Reference-contexts: The reasons for this skepticism are clear. First, the particular configurations and motions observed in natural gesture are inherently speaker dependent, influenced by cultural, educational, and situational factors <ref> [5] </ref>. An approach employing fixed, physical descriptions of gesture might find no cross-speaker invariances. Second, and more important, is that the literal representation of the gesture assumes that the spatial configuration is in fact the most significant aspect of the signal to be extracted.

Reference-contexts: Because there is not tremendous variation in imagery of a person telling a story, and since it can be shown that two points that are nearby in the original image space are also nearby in the resulting low-dimensional space <ref> [7] </ref>, we only need retain a small number of coefficients for this work. In the experiments reported here, we use only n = 10 coefficients to represent each frame; on average the 10 coefficients account for 55% of the variance.

Reference-contexts: To incorporate multiple rest states, we redefine distance to the rest state feature as the minimum distance to all of the chosen subsequences. To then detect the relevant gestures we simply parse the incoming video stream with respect to the gesture-phase-FSM; the parsing algorithm is a duration-modified Viterbi optimization <ref> [8] </ref>. subsequence of one of the two video sequences tested; the other sections have similar results. The top two traces indicate the manually annotated labeling of tri-phasic and beat gestures. These labels were generated by the third author before seeing any of the results.

Reference-contexts: Because the focus of our analysis is on the temporal characteristics of the sequences we select the rather aggressive approach of representing each frame by a small number of coefficients derived from an eigenvector decomposition of the images <ref> [12] </ref>. We apply the technique to image sequences by randomly selecting a few hundred frames, computing the eigenvector decomposition of these frames, and then projecting all frames of the image sequence onto the resulting basis set.
