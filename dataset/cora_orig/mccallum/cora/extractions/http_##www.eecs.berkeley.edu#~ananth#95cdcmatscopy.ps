Abstract: 1 Several recent empirical studies of traffic to be carried by broadband networks have established the importance of studying queueing behaviour with traffic models having long-range dependence. We consider discrete time models for an ATM buffer fed by a class of long-range dependent arrival processes that includes the asymptotically self-similar arrival processes of the kind recently proposed by Likhanov et al. [1]. An arrival model in this class is parametrized by a session generation rate &gt; 0, a cell generation rate per session R &gt; 0, and a session duration random variable t which is positive integer valued with finite mean and infinite variance and has regularly varying tail, i. e. P (t &gt; t) ~ t ff L(t) where 1 &lt; ff &lt; 2 and L() is a slowly varying function. The service is modelled by a single parameter, the service rate s &gt; 0. The stability condition s &gt; REt is assumed to hold. We study the asymptotics of the tail of the stationary sojourn time distribution of a typical session.
