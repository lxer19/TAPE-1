Title: Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification Status of this

Pubnum: Memo  
Abstract: This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state and status of this protocol. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Abstract This document specifies a set of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) messages for use with version 6 of the Internet Protocol (IPv6). The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) messages specified in STD 5, RFC 1112 have been merged into ICMP, for IPv6, and are included in this document.

Reference-contexts: Other documents may also introduce additional ICMPv6 message types, such as Neighbor Discovery messages [IPv6-DISC], subject to the general rules for ICMPv6 messages given in section 2 of this document.

ICMPv6 (ICMP for IPv6) ICMPv6 is used by IPv6 nodes to report errors encountered in processing packets, and to perform other internet-layer functions, such as diagnostics (ICMPv6 "ping") and multicast membership reporting. <p> interface must be used as the Source Address of the message. 2.3 Message Checksum Calculation The checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement sum of the entire ICMPv6 message starting with the ICMPv6 message type field, prepended with a "pseudo-header" of IPv6 header fields, as specified in <ref> [IPv6, section 8.1] </ref>. <p> The Next Header value used in the pseudo-header is 58. (NOTE: the inclusion of a pseudo-header in the ICMPv6 checksum is a change from IPv4; see <ref> [IPv6] </ref> for the rationale for this change.) For computing the checksum, the checksum field is set to zero. 2.4 Message Processing Rules Implementations MUST observe the following rules when processing ICMPv6 messages (from [RFC-1122]): (a) If an ICMPv6 error message of unknown type is received, it MUST be passed to the

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The Internet Protocol, version 6 (IPv6) is a new version of IP. IPv6 uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) as defined for IPv4 <ref> [RFC-792] </ref>, with a number of changes. The Internet Group Membership Protocol (IGMP) specified for IPv4 [RFC-1112] has also been revised and has been absorbed into ICMP for IPv6. The resulting protocol is called ICMPv6, and has an IPv6 Next Header value of 58.
