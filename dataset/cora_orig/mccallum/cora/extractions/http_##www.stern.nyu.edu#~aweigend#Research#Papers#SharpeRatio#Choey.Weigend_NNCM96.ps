Abstract: Working Paper IS-97-005, Leonard N. Stern School of Business, New York University. In: Decision Technologies for Financial Engineering (Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Neural Networks in the Capital Markets, NNCM-96), pp. 3-22. Edited by A.S.Weigend, Y.S.Abu-Mostafa, and A.-P.N.Refenes. Singapore: World Scientific, 1997. http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~aweigend/Research/Papers/SharpeRatio While many trading strategies are based on price prediction, traders in financial markets are typically interested in risk-adjusted performance such as the Sharpe Ratio, rather than price predictions themselves. This paper introduces an approach which generates a nonlinear strategy that explicitly maximizes the Sharpe Ratio. It is expressed as a neural network model whose output is the position size between a risky and a risk-free asset. The iterative parameter update rules are derived and compared to alternative approaches. The resulting trading strategy is evaluated and analyzed on both computer-generated data and real world data (DAX, the daily German equity index). Trading based on Sharpe Ratio maximization compares favorably to both profit optimization and probability matching (through cross-entropy optimization). The results show that the goal of optimizing out-of-sample risk-adjusted profit can be achieved with this nonlinear approach.

Reference-contexts: This single quantity is called the reward-to-risk ratio or risk-adjusted performance. There are several risk-adjusted measures based on different notions of risk. 3 Examples are the Sharpe Ratio (the focus of this paper), the Jensen Alpha, and the Treynor Ratio <ref> (Hammer, 1991) </ref>. 1.2 The Sharpe Ratio The Sharpe Ratio (SR) takes the mean of the excess profit or excess return and divides it by the standard deviation of the excess return (Sharpe, 1970; Sharpe, 1994).

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the optimal abs (ff) decreases as an increasing function of abs (x). This relationship can be seen because the standard deviation is symmetrical: it is indifferent to the sign of the return and reveals one of the intrinsic weaknesses of SR as a performance measure <ref> (Sharpe, 1970) </ref>. 6.2 Noisy Data In the second experiment, s i is no longer constant, but now drawn randomly, for each pattern, from a uniform distribution (0; 2 p 3). Both m i and s i are given to the network as inputs.
