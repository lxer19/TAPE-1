Abstract: In automated negotiation systems consisting of self-interested agents, contracts have traditionally been binding, i.e., impossible to breach. Such contracts do not allow the agents to efficiently deal with future events. This deficiency can be tackled by using a leveled commitment contracting protocol which allows the agents to decommit from contracts by paying a monetary penalty to the contracting partner. The efficiency of such protocols depends heavily on how the penalties are decided. In this paper, different leveled commitment protocols and their parameterizations are empirically compared to each other and to several full commitment protocols. In the different experiments, the agents are of different types: self-interested or cooperative, and they can perform different levels of lookahead. Surprisingly, self-interested myopic agents reach a higher social welfare quicker than cooperative myopic agents when decommitment penalties are low. The social welfare in settings with agents that performed looka-head did not vary as much with the decommitment penalty as the social welfare in settings that consisted of myopic agents. For a short range of values of the de-commitment penalty, myopic agents performed almost as well as agents that performed lookahead. In all of the settings studied, the best way to set the decommit-ment penalties was to choose low penalties, but ones that were greater than zero. This indicates that leveled commitment contracting protocols outperform both full commitment protocols and commitment free protocols. 1 Introduction

Reference-contexts: Leveled commitment contracts can simulate full commitment contracts by using infinite decommitment penalties. Even if the leveled commitment contracts are limited to handle only one task, they can emulate full commitment contracts that are capable of handling several tasks in one single contract <ref> [1, 2, 3, 9, 10] </ref>. With leveled commitment protocols there is no need for an agent to conduct a feasibility check before contracting. If the contract cannot be performed, because of lack of resources etc., the agent can decommit from the engagement.

Reference-contexts: The main ideas are that the party that breaches must compensate the victim for lost profit and that the penalties for breaching contracts should be set so that the social welfare is maximized. Strategic thinking behind contracting and one-sided decommitment among self-interested agents has been studied <ref> [6] </ref>, where the decision making mechanism is modeled as a Markov-process. They assume that the agents expect none of their bids to be accepted, which makes the approach unsound from the perspective of game theory.

Reference-contexts: Also, the agents do not need to perform a complete computation of the marginal costs before taking on a contract, but can complete the computation after contracting. 2 The concept of breaching contracts in the real world is analyzed by Posner <ref> [7] </ref>. The main ideas are that the party that breaches must compensate the victim for lost profit and that the penalties for breaching contracts should be set so that the social welfare is maximized. <p> 3 However, the social welfare may decrease because of the inefficiency arising from the contract that is breached. 4 One reason for having over-compensating penalties is that one agent can make himself more trustworthy and the expected utility of the other agent will increase enough to make the contract possible <ref> [7] </ref>. Hence, over-compensating penalties can increase the space of possible contracts. However, it would limit the space of possible decommitments. and protocols included in the study. Next, is the notation of the different protocols presented, followed by a description how the data was evaluated.

Reference-contexts: Contingency contracts have been suggested to be used between self-interested agents when they do not have complete knowledge about future events <ref> [8] </ref>. In these contracts the obligations of the contract are made conditional on future events. Contingency contracts can increase the expected payoff of both parties, enabling more contracts than full commitment contracts.

Reference-contexts: Recently, a leveled commitment protocol has been proposed that allows self-interested agents to decom-mit from a contract by simply paying a decommitment penalty to the partner of the contract <ref> [11] </ref>. In that protocol, the decommitment penalties are decided at the time of contracting and the penalties do not need to be the same for the two contracting parties. <p> Then the results are presented and discussed. 1.1 Leveled Commitment Protocols The penalties could be chosen freely by the agents, in which case each agent would try to optimize the penalties in its favor <ref> [11] </ref>. The negotiation will be more complex if the agents can decide the penalties themselves compared to when they are set by the protocol because there would be more variables to agree on in order for all parties to accept a contract.
