Abstract: Machine learning and knowledge acquisition from experts have distinct knowledge acquisition capabilities that appear to be complementary. This study demonstrates that the integration of these approaches can both improve the accuracy of the knowledge base that is developed and reduce the time taken to develop it. In addition, users expected the expert systems created through the integrated approach to have higher accuracy than the expert systems created without machine learning and rated the integrated approach less difficult to use. They also provided favorable evaluations of both the specific integrated software and of the general value of machine learning for knowledge acquisition. The system studied, called The Knowledge Factory, is distinguished by the manner in which it supports direct interaction with domain experts with little or no knowledge engineering expertise. The benefits reported relate to use by such users.

Reference-contexts: The knowledge acquisition tasks were based on two data sets from the UCI repository of machine learning datasets <ref> (Murphy & Aha, 1997) </ref>: Glass and Soybean Large. These data sets were chosen to provide a mix of different characteristics. Of the two possible class variables for the Glass dataset we used that which defines three classes: Float, Not float and Other.

Reference-contexts: The Soybean Large dataset defines a task with nineteen classes (different diseases). The Glass dataset has nine real valued attributes while the Soybean Large dataset has 35 categorical attributes. The Glass dataset has 214 cases while Soybean Large has 683. To provide subjects with expertise in the domains, C4.5rules <ref> (Quinlan, 1993) </ref> was used to create sets of rules. These rules were presented to the subjects, providing them with background knowledge about the domain. C4.5rules was used in order to provide different insights and analysis from those provided by The Knowledge Factory.

Reference-contexts: Revise Current Ruleset: This command applies the DLGref2 inductive refinement algorithm <ref> (Webb, 1993) </ref> to refine the current set of rules. DLGref2 seeks to modify each of the existing rules the least amount necessary in order to optimize the preference criterion. The preference criterion defined by equation 1 was used in this study.

Reference-contexts: Previous experience with student use of The Knowledge Factory software had shown that there was a tendency for students to explore the full range of features provided by the software. The software can support multiple modes of machine learning and multiple modes of rule interpretation <ref> (Webb, 1996) </ref>. As this capability did not bear directly upon the issues to be explored by this study, these facilities were disabled. The default machine learning and rule interpretation settings were employed with the following exception.

Reference-contexts: The learning-disabled version was identical to the learning-enabled version except that the following commands were disabled: Develop New Rules: This command deletes any existing rules and then applies the DLG machine learning algorithm <ref> (Webb & Agar, 1992) </ref>, a variant of Michalski's (1983) AQ, to the training examples to form a new set of rules. Revise Current Ruleset: This command applies the DLGref2 inductive refinement algorithm (Webb, 1993) to refine the current set of rules.
