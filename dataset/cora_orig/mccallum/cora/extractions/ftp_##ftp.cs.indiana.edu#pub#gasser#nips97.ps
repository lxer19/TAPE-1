Title: A Model of the Acquisition of Spatial-Relation Concepts and Words  
Author: Eliana Colunga-Leal and Michael Gasser

Abstract: This paper is about the acquisition of spatial relations, both conceptual and linguistic. Spatial relations, we propose, are defined by correlations across different perceptual modalities. The nature of the correlations that define a relation determines how hard learning a word for that relation will be. We present a connectionist model that learns about relations in two phases, a pre-linguistic phase in which concepts are organized according to the perceptual input, and a linguistic phase, in which preexisting concepts are re-organized under the influence of words. This model accounts for the order in which spatial relation terms are learned by children.

Reference-contexts: For a long time, it was thought that left-right discrimination problems were due to lack of maturation, but recent evidence shows that 4-year-olds can be trained to solve the task <ref> (Braine, 1988) </ref>. Gibson (1969) accounts for them by positing attentional defficits. Braine & Fisher (1988) claim they occur because of insufficient cognitive development. Logan (1995) suggests they are a result of a failure to maintain the different frames of reference that are necessary to solve the task.

Reference-contexts: As we move up, representations get more abstract, starting from specific instances and going to categories that are more or less context-free. At the highest level, maps from different domains are associated with one another <ref> (Edelman, 1987) </ref>, resulting in the highest level of abstraction. According to our model, at the lowest level all spatial relations are equally hard. However, as we move up, some relations are more easily clumped into categories. This is because of the way the different domains that define the relation correlate.

Reference-contexts: There is a general pattern that babies follow when learning spatial relations. Under and on top of are among the first relational terms learned by children, being comprehended at around 16 months and produced by 30 months of age <ref> (Fenson et al., 1993) </ref>. Next to and beside appear a little later and to the left of and to the right of much later (Clark, 1973).

Reference-contexts: We are particularly interested in how vision, motion, proprioception and language interact in shaping spatial concepts throughout development <ref> (Gasser and Colunga-Leal, 1997) </ref>. Here we will concentrate mostly on the Where side of the visual system (Figure 1b) because that is where categorical spatial relations are formed (Kosslyn, 1994). Our model is organized as a series of maps at different levels of abstraction (Kosslyn, 1994).

Reference-contexts: During linguistic learning, the addition of Language-level inputs and outputs modifies the system's spatial relations, as connection weights develop between the Spatial Concepts and Language layer and within the Language layer and as other connection weights are modified. The network is trained using a variant of Contrastive Hebbian Learning <ref> (Movellan, 1990) </ref>, modified to accommodate unsupervised learning (auto-association) and phase angles. In Contrastive Hebbian Learning, weight updates take place in positive (Hebbian) and negative (anti-Hebbian) phases.

Reference-contexts: In a sense, this is true, as as shown by recent evidence suggesting that infants as young as 34 months are able to categorize both LEFT-RIGHT (Behl-Chadha, 1995) and ABOVE-BELOW <ref> (Quinn et al., 1996) </ref> spatial relations. But this is not all there is to spatial relations. Categorizing spatial relations goes beyond visual input.
