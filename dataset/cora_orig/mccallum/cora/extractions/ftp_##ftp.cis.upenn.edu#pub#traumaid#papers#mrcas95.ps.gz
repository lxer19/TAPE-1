Abstract: Injuries in trauma affect anatomical structures, indirectly affecting physiological systems through mechanical behavior and physical proximity. This paper describes the theory and preliminary results from our approach to couple a 3D anatomical model of the chest with a physiological model of respiratory mechanics. In particular, we investigated behavior in quiet, normal breathing and an open sucking chest wound. We envision that our integrated simulation of respiratory anatomy and respiratory mechanics could assist students in visualizing and predicting relationships between structural-anatomical and functional-physiological changes in an interactive, 3D environment.

Reference-contexts: cases we simulate, we used the following parameters: R aw = 1:7 liters/sec R cw = 0:3 liters/sec C l = 0:2 liters/cm H 2 O C cw = 0:15 liters/cm H 2 O: We used airway resistance (R aw ) and lung compliance (C l ) from the literature <ref> [2] </ref>, and estimated the chest wall parameters. 4.2.3 Pneumothoraces Pneumothoraces, or the pathological presence of gas within the intrapleural space, can result from penetrating trauma to the chest. Any more than a small amount of air in the intrapleural space will impede normal lung function. This can be life-threatening.

Reference-contexts: Because the anatomical components are principally soft tissue, that response must include object deformation. Object deformation must be accompanied by physiological response. Since this is a requirement for surgical simulation, we might expect to see this addressed in the literature. However, Dumay <ref> [7] </ref> points out that current, first generation surgical simulators generally 2 focus on rendering anatomy without addressing com-mensurate physiological or pathophysiological models, though they recognize their importance. This section describes our methodologies for anatomical and physiological modeling.

Reference-contexts: Respiratory mechanics is the study of mechanics applied to the respiratory system. In reviewing respiratory mechanics modeling, Ligas and Primiano <ref> [10] </ref> distinguish two modeling paradigms: classical and formal mechanical modeling. The distinction refers to the form of the model and variables. Classical mechanical models represent forces and displacements as scalar values, such as volume to represent generalized displacement and pressure differences to represent generalized forces. <p> We therefore model the physiology using the classical approach. The basic equation for classical models relates a sum of pressure differences to a function of volume, its derivatives, and derivatives of pressure differences <ref> [10] </ref>: X In the classical model formulation, the respiratory system is modeled as a series of deformable or rigid compartments through and into which gas flows. The variable P represents a pressure difference, typically between the ends of a compartment or across a surface. <p> For our initial effort, we consider the lung as a single-compartment, viscoelastic structure. Its P to V relationship will therefore include volume and only its first derivative. We linearize (2) by truncating the Taylor series expansion about an operating point (P 0 ; V 0 ): X (3) Following <ref> [10] </ref>, we represent the change about an operating point in lowercase letters. This reduces Equation (3) to the general form for our models: X In Equation (4), the coefficient of volume is compliance and the coefficient of the volume's first derivative is resistance. <p> Our approach merely assumes that for small maneuvers, the change in pleural pressure is approximately the same. The approach we describe to modeling respiratory mechanics and other physiological processes is well documented in the physiological literature <ref> [10, 12] </ref>. The results agree with qualitative clinical descriptions of normal, quiet breathing [9]. Our future work will involve applying clinical data to our models to improve their clinical fidelity.

Reference-contexts: can produce accurate deformation results, they are currently too computationally-intensive for our desired level of accuracy and our real-time simulation requirements (e.g., concurrent physiological simulation, collision detection, and resolution). 4.1.1 Lumped-Parameter Modeling in 3D To meet real-time performance demands, we have chosen to pursue our modeling using viscoelastic, lumped-parameter models <ref> [15] </ref>. In this approach, one models surfaces or volumes as a collection of nodes and edges between nodes. Mass is concentrated at the nodes with dampened springs along the edges. The system state is described by the position and velocity of the node collection.
