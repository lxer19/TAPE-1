Abstract: A major aspect of Open Systems network management is the inter-working between distinct Management architectures. This paper details the development of a generic object oriented application level gateway that achieves seamless coexistence between OSI and SNMPv1 management systems. The work builds upon the Network Management Forums ISO/CCITT and Internet Management Coexistence activities. The power of the OSI Systems Management Functions is made available for the management of SNMPv1 based resources, bringing fully event driven management to the SNMP domain.

Reference-contexts: The collaborative work of the Network Management Forums (NMF) ISO/CCITT and Internet Management Coexistence (IIMC) activities has provided a sound basis to our efforts in achieving coexistence through automated application level gateways. Through out this paper we shall use the terms proxy, application level gateway and Q-Adapter <ref> [M3010] </ref> synonymously, to indicate the automated translation of information and protocol models, so as to achieve the representation of management objects defined under one proprietary paradigm under that of an alternative model, namely OSI. <p> The instance sub-identifiers are then converted to either a NULL or SEQUENCE syntax as in the example DN above. In terms of the TMN standards <ref> [M3010] </ref> the information model produced by the IIMC translation rules is Q x rather than Q 3 .

Reference-contexts: It is the authors contention that coexistence can most readily be achieved by selecting a semantically rich reference model as the basis for this inter-working. Such an approach can then be readily extended to encompass both up and coming technologies such as CORBA <ref> [OMG91] </ref>, together with architectures that have not yet bridged the synaptic gap in the collective minds of standards bodies and manufacturers consortia.

Reference-contexts: ICM has a mandate to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating Advanced Information Processing technologies for Telecommunication Management Networks. The gateway has been developed using the Object Oriented power of UCLs OSI Management Information Service development platform <ref> [Pavlou, 1993] </ref>. 2 COMPARISON OF THE OSI AND SNMP MODELS The approaches are a result of two distinct (some would say diametrically opposed) underlying tenets. The Internet-standard Network Management Framework is based on the notion of universal resource deployment. <p> The completed event report must then be forwarded to any manager that has previously requested such reports, and may also be logged locally. 4 THE OSIMIS PLATFORM SUPPORT The OSI Management Information Service <ref> [Pavlou, 1993] </ref> provides a generic and extensible management platform. The support provided for the development of management agents is known as the Generic Managed System (GMS).

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION Whether driven by technological merit, simplicity of development or government profiles, considerable investments have been made and will continue to be made into the provision of network management solutions based on the two dominant management architectures, namely SNMPv1 <ref> [RFC1155, RFC1157, RFC1212] </ref> and OSI [X701,X720]. They exist together so they must be made to coexist, so as to achieve global inter-working across heterogeneous platforms in the management domain.

Reference-contexts: We shall consider two comparative cases in the retrieval of the ip and tcp groups <ref> [RFC1213] </ref> from a remote ISODE SNMPv1 agent. The comparisons are against direct SNMPv1 retrieval using the dump command of ISODEs snmpi manager application, see Figure 7. Notes : The OSI timings do not include the association setup and tear down components, which are around 0.2s and 0.02s respectively.

Reference-contexts: The manager might be utilising a remote monitoring agent <ref> [RMON94] </ref> to achieve its goals, but this is limited to transmission paths that offer a promiscuous mode of operation. 6.2 Using an OSI manager Localised polling can be remotely configured by the creation of metric monitor objects at the OSI agent or Internet Q-Adapter.

Reference-contexts: The Internet-standard Network Management Framework is based on the notion of universal resource deployment. This may be alternatively stated by the fundamental axiom: The impact of adding network management to managed nodes must be minimal, reecting a lowest common denominator <ref> [Rose, 1991] </ref> In contrast the OSI standardization process attempts to achieve an all encompassing framework, to meet any future management requirements.

Reference-contexts: The end-to-end argument <ref> [Saltzer et al, 1984] </ref> makes a very strong case for leaving the selection of aspects such as the transport protocol to the application level, since only the application (in this case management) has a complete appreciation of its transport requirements.

Reference-contexts: To reduce requirements for remote polling and data retrieval the Metric Monitor [X738] and Summarization SMFs [X739] have been developed.

Reference-contexts: The Managed Object data is held in a management database called the Management Information Base (MIB). Both SNMP and OSI define schemata for the description of Managed Object MIB data, namely the Structure of Management Information (SMI)[RFC1155, RFC1212] and the Guidelines for the Definition of Managed Objects (GDMO) <ref> [X722] </ref>. The OSI information model is object-oriented and permits the refinement of existing Managed Object templates via inheritance, see Figure 2. Refinement may occur due to an increase in the capabilities of a given Managed Object, perhaps due to the evolution in the technology of the underlying resource.
