Abstract: A more detailed formalization of part of the QSIM framework has been found to be useful. That formalization is presented here in brief. The new formalization makes it easier to make and prove some useful statements. The formalization of temporal reasoning about continuous systems [7] and the precise definition of completeness are examples of the usefulness of this formalization.

Reference-contexts: Quantitative Information When strong-cycle matching is used and cross-edge cycles are not allowed, then the QDE and the initial state may be augmented with quantitative information such as numerical interval bounds on the real values denoted by landmarks and other symbolic terms in the behavior prediction <ref> [1, 3, 5, 6] </ref>. In this case, QSIM propogates this quantitative information and uses it to prune branches of the tree which are inconsistent with the information. The most important quantitative information for the purposes of this paper is the information which QSIM derives about the landmarks.

Reference-contexts: The resulting X may not be fusion closed. A set X is fusion closed if, whenever x 1 sy 1 ; x 2 sy 2 2 X, then x 1 sy 2 2 X.

Reference-contexts: We say that the ODE abstracts to the QDE. ODE and Simultaneous Equations There is an algorithm which takes any ODE, F , and translates it into a set, F 0 , of simultaneous equations. (See Section 3.3.1 of Kuipers' Qualitative Reasoning <ref> [6] </ref>.) This set, F 0 , of equations can likewise be translated back to F . Given a solution, U , of F 0 , a similar procedure translates U into a solution to F . The variables which are introduced in F 0 stand for functions of time. <p> The algorithm which produces F 0 from F is such that the top-level operator in each equation in F 0 is associated with some QSIM constraint. Thus F 0 is translated into a QDE. (See Section 3.3.1 of Kuipers' Qualitative Reasoning <ref> [6] </ref>.) There are constraints which provide for the translation of multivariate functions so that complex ODEs can be handled. Additional information can be encoded by the user into the QDE and initial state. More flexible and powerful constraints are still being added to the QSIM framework. <p> However, by applying the envi--sionment simulation style (no new landmarks, weak cycle-match criterion, and cycle matches anywhere in the behavior tree), every qualitative model has a finite closed behavior tree. (See Chapter 5 of Kuipers' Qualitative Reasoning <ref> [6] </ref>.) The Represented QSIM Structure Due to the fact that some QSIM behaviors terminate at cycle states, we do not want to claim that it is QSIM behaviors (i.e. elements of B) which describe the solutions to ODE, rather we want to reason about paths which consider cycle states to have <p> Quantitative Information When strong-cycle matching is used and cross-edge cycles are not allowed, then the QDE and the initial state may be augmented with quantitative information such as numerical interval bounds on the real values denoted by landmarks and other symbolic terms in the behavior prediction <ref> [1, 3, 5, 6] </ref>.
