Title: Transistor Sizing for Low Power CMOS Circuits  
Author: Manjit Borah, Robert Michael Owens and Mary Jane Irwin 
Abstract: A direct approach to transistor sizing for minimizing the power consumption of a CMOS circuit under a delay constraint is presented. In contrast to the existing assumption that the power consumption of a static CMOS circuit is proportional to the active area of the circuit, it is shown that the power consumption is a convex function of the active area. Analytical formulation for the power dissipation of a circuit in terms of the transistor size is derived which includes both the capacitive and the short circuit power dissipation. SPICE circuit simulation results are presented to confirm the correctness of the analytical model. Based on the intuitions drawn from the analytical model, heuristics for initial transistor sizing on critical and non critical paths for minimum power consumption are developed. Further, fast heuristics to perform transistor sizing in CMOS circuits for minimizing power consumption while meeting the given delay constraints are presented.

Reference-contexts: III. Minimizing power consumption subject to delay constraint The above intuitions can be directly applied to an iterative transistor sizing algorithm such as TILOS <ref> [3] </ref>. In a TILOS like algorithm the circuit performance is optimized by sizing the transistor which gives the best performance gain on the current critical path in each iteration.

Reference-contexts: The delay and transition time of the output signal of the gate g 1 (i.e., o 1 ) is affected by the sizing of the transistors in g 1 . The output signal delay of an inverter is given by <ref> [5] </ref>: o 1 = OE W 1 o (1 + V the first term is the delay response to a step function based on the gate geometry and the second term is the delay due to the input transition time. Here OE is a process dependent constant.

Reference-contexts: The power consumption of a NAND or NOR gate also depends on the positioning of the inputs and their arrival sequence. The switching capacitances involved during the transition using different paths within a gate may vary significantly due to source/drain parasitics. Hossain et al, in <ref> [7] </ref> reported 13 to 17% improvement in power dissipation by switching activity based input reordering. Circuit simulation results indicate that the power savings by power optimal transistor sizing can be augmented by the power optimization due to input reordering.

Perflex uses the Elmore delay model to analyze the circuit and applies transistor sizing and input reordering to achieve circuit speed.

Reference-contexts: It is assumed that the transistors in a series connected chain are sized uniformly. Tapering of the transistor widths in long series chains such that the transistor closest to the power/ground node has the largest width, may result in speedup and saving in power dissipation <ref> [18] </ref>. Tapering is useful only when the total internal source/drain capacitance of a gate is larger than or com-parable to the total load capacitance, which is not true in the case of a typical high fan-out gate.
