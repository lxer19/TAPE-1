Abstract: We describe a portable and robust software mechanism for adaptive frame rate control for real time packet video transfer and viewing in workstation environments. No special hardware or system support is assumed. Our contributions include (1) a responsive feedback system for dynamic presentation layer rate control in response to network load, (2) a simple and effective transport layer flow control scheme built upon an unreliable network protocol, and (3) data structures and scheduling support for integrating the rate and flow control mechanisms. We demonstrate that excellent jitter control is achieved by gracefully trading image resolution, and loss rates can be drastically reduced by appropriate flow control.

Reference-contexts: We used ff = 0:5, but the choice was not critical. When setting F and , we also clip them within some intervals [F MIN ; F MAX ] and [ MIN ; MAX ] to ensure stability in extreme cases. 3.2 Transport Layer Flow Control Even though TCP <ref> [1] </ref> provides a reliable and flow-controlled byte-stream, this protocol is too heavyweight for our purpose. For real time video viewing, retransmission to make up for dropped packets is not practical. Furthermore, TCP handles flow control using dynamic window management, which as we shall see, is not suitable for our application.

A responsive, portable and robust feedback control has been designed to gracefully trade image resolution for frame rate stability.

Reference-contexts: Flow control schemes that are too conservative under-utilize network resources while transmissions that are too aggressive lead to high packet losses. Recently, the Tenet group at Berkeley have explored specialized network protocols and operating system support for such real time applications <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Motion video transmission for real time viewing over packet switched networks is an established area of multimedia research <ref> [4] </ref>, with attractive applications such as video conferencing and picture telephony. However, it has performance requirements on transmission delay, jitter, loss, available bandwidth and process scheduling priority that conventional networks and operating systems have, until recently, been unable to provide with guarantee.

Reference-contexts: If not, we recursively apply the algorithm on the four n 2 fi n 2 squares. Thus the subdivision of the image space is logically a quadtree structure. Quadtree encoding is not new <ref> [5] </ref>, but the criterion for subdividing a block is often based on the variance of all pixel values in the block. We use a different criterion for two important reasons.

Reference-contexts: We make estimates of the compression factor and introduce the notion of a load line, which is central to our adaptation scheme described later on. Sending uncompressed motion video at reasonable size and frame rate puts a heavy burden on the network. A large number of signal processing algorithms <ref> [6] </ref> are known for encoding a video image into fewer bits, reducing the spatial redundancy and hence bandwidth requirement. The spatial redundancy arises out of the fact that for most common images, surfaces and light sources are piecewise continuous.
