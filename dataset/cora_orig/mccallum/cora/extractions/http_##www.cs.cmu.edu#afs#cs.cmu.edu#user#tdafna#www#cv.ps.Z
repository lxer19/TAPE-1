Title: On the Radius-Edge Condition in the Control Volume Method  
Author: Gary L. Miller Dafna Talmor Shang-Hua Teng AND Noel Walkington 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the control volume algorithm for the solution of Poisson's equation in three dimensions will converge when the mesh contains very flat tetrahedra (slivers). These tetrahedra are characterized by the fact that they have modest ratios of diameter to shortest edge, but large circum to inscribed sphere radius ratios, so may have poor interpolation properties. Elimination of slivers is a notoriously difficult problem for automatic mesh generation algorithms. We also show that a discrete Poincare inequality will continue to hold in the presence of slivers. 1. Introduction. We consider covolume approximations of Poisson's equation on a three dimensional domain. It is shown that the control volume algorithm will converge on meshes that contain

Reference-contexts: Sphere Packings and Mesh Generation. Mesh generation has a long history; however, rigorous analysis of the algorithms and the meshes they produce is a recent development. Bern Epstein and Gilbert <ref> [2] </ref> were the first to establish optimality of the the quad-tree algorithm for the generation of two dimensional meshes.

Reference-contexts: An optimal two dimensional algorithm that appears to work very well in practice was given by Ruppert [9]. This algorithm extended an idea of Chew <ref> [3] </ref>, and uses the Voronoi/Delaunay constructions. Ruppert's algorithm doesn't extend immediately to three dimensions since it may produce "slivers", that is, very flat tetrahedra whose edge lengths are comparable with the circum sphere radius (see Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: The Delaunay triangulation is then constructed by joining points in X that share a common Voronoi face. This construction is well known in computational geometry <ref> [4] </ref>, and there are efficient algorithms for implementing it in any number of dimensions, and will generate a graded mesh according to the distribution of the points in X. 2 The meshes we consider below assume that the triangulation satisfies the following weakened aspect ratio condition: Definition 1 (Bounded radius-edge ratio).

Reference-contexts: Each edge x i x j of the Delaunay mesh can be associated with a face common to V i and V j which we denote by A ij . Following MacNeal <ref> [5] </ref> discrete approximations of u are constructed by integrating the equation for u over each Voronoi corresponding to an interior vertex: Z f = V i Z @n X Z @n X jA ij j h ij In the above, N i is the index set of the nodes connected to <p> Poincare Inequality. The Poincare inequality states that for a bounded domain &lt; d there is a constant C &gt; 0 such that kuk L 2 () Ckruk L 2 () for all sufficiently smooth functions u : ! &lt; vanishing on the boundary @. MacNeal <ref> [5] </ref> has shown that in two dimensions the W norm (defined in Section 2.?) is equal to the H 1 () norm, in the sense that the piecewise linear extension, ~u, of u defined on the vertices of a triangulation satisfies kuk 2 W = jr~uj 2 .

Reference-contexts: We answer this in the affirmative by establishing a discrete Poincare inequality which will imply convergence of the control volume method in L 2 (). These results evolved from our work on mesh generation algorithms <ref> [7, 7] </ref> and an attempt to resolve the problems slivers present in approximation theory. <p> Folk lore indicates that they do not, and this is substantiated by the numerical example in Section 3. In order to put the geometric assumptions in context, Section 2 reviews the essential features of the mesh generation algorithm developed in <ref> [7] </ref>. As indicated above, this algorithm does guarantees a bound on the radius edge aspect ratio. The proof of convergence for Poisson's equation under the bounded radius edge ratio assumption is presented Section 3 along with an example which highlights the differences between the covolume and finite element schemes. <p> If v is the center of a Delaunay ball (i.e. the circumsphere of a tetrahedra) of radius r in the Voronoi/Delaunay triangulation of X then (v) (1 jj Lip =2)r.
