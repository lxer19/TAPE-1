Abstract: In sheet metal fabrication, bending is used in order to obtain rigidity and to obtain a part of desired shape and function. In analyzing a sheet metal part, an important consideration is how to unfold the part after a bending operation or series of bending operations. The unfolding process is the first major step in process planning for generating NC paths for a sheet metal blank. This paper addresses the problem of determining whether or not a part can be unfolded. A graph based approach using the face-edge of the sheet metal part is at the heart of the algorithm presented here. Using this algorithm one can determine which faces are unfoldable and which cannot be unfolded.

Reference-contexts: In fact, many sheet metal parts are designed using a wireframe approach to model their parts. In a previous paper <ref> [5] </ref>, methods for developing a set of principles for extracting, recognizing and reasoning about features from sheet metal parts which are created on a CAD system were described. This work follows the approach of the previous paper, in using wireframe models.

Reference-contexts: Wireframe data is processed to obtain surface representations and to directly use boundary models. In addition, the geometric data about the product is derived from some neutral CAD data such as the Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) system <ref> [6] </ref>. We present principles that can be used to determine whether a sheet metal part that has already been bent into a specific shape can be unfolded. To facilitate the process of finding this possibility of unfolding a part, a graph based approach is used.

Reference-contexts: Because t is a strong function of the material (which will not change within a modled component), bending angle, and bending ratio; this is a good working assumption. In choosing a value for t we follow the approach of <ref> [9] </ref>. The process of developing the contour group of a sheet metal component begins by choosing a face as a base-face of edges. Based on this base-face, all adjacent faces can be flattened recursively. The methodology used to accomplish this task is illustrated in Figure 4.

Reference-contexts: Using this example, the importance of adjacent topology (edge-face adjacent topology) for determining the unfoldability of a sheet metal part is clear. This also shows the usage of a graph structure to represent edge-face topology explicitly <ref> [10] </ref>. Even with the edge-face topology represented as a graph, the geometric shape is not fully defined, and using this information alone, it is impossible to tell whether or not the part can be unfolded.

Reference-contexts: As shown in the previous section, the algorithm presented cannot handle cases that combine bending and forming. Given the current interest in process planning for sheet metal fabrication <ref> [11] </ref>, we intend to continue our study in developing an algorithm which allows us to handle cases where both bending and other forming operations are used for making the contour of a sheet metal part.
