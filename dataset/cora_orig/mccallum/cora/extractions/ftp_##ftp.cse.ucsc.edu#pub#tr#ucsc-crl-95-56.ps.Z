Abstract: In this paper, a new method named Dimension Reduction Technique (DRT) is presented for capacitance extraction of 3D multilayer and multiconductor interconnects. In this technique, a complex 3D problem is decomposed to a series of simpler 2D problems. Therefore, it results in dramatical savings in computing time and memory usage. Compared to FASTCAP, a field solver based on BEM with multipole acceleration and developed from MIT[NW92], DRT is generally an order of magnitude faster with significantly less memory usage. Based on this technique, accurate close-form formulae or data base can be generated efficiently for calculating the capacitances of some typical 3D structures of VLSI interconnect.

Reference-contexts: An alternative choice is to pre-compute the parasitics of typical geometry structures for a given technology and compute the parasitics of interconnects on-line by numerical table look-up <ref> [CCOL92] </ref>. This method also turns out to be unpractical due to the requirement of excessive computer memory space to store all the 10 6. Conclusion pre-computed parasitics. The best choice for on-line design is to have closed-form expression of corresponding parasitics.

Reference-contexts: For the same component, there may be several empirical expressions obtained from different approximations, and each has different valid range. It was also observed that solutions from different approximations could differ considerably <ref> [KC79] </ref>. Therefore, results from DRT can be used to verify and modify various approximations and empirical expressions which have been developed throughout the last several decades, and can also be used to synthesize closed-form formula of electrical parameters as function of geometry parameters such as widths and spacings.

Reference-contexts: The other category is to solve electric potential or elec-tromagnetc field integral equations such as Method of Moments (MoM)[CHMS84], the Boundary Element Method (BEM)[PWG92], and the multipole accelerated technique <ref> [NW92] </ref>. They make meshes on the surface of the object. For multilayer multiconductor interconnects, this means the surface of each conductor and dielectric interface are divided into meshes. Compared to FD, this greatly reduces the number of unknowns. <p> This results in dramatical savings in computing time and memory needs. For considerable complex 3D multilayer and multiconductor problems, this technique is generally several even tens times faster than the BEM with multipole acceleration (compared with FASTCAP from MIT <ref> [NW92] </ref>). <p> The potential distribution functions and then the capacitances are obtained from the solutions of these matrix equations. 4 Experimental Results Table 1 shows the comparison of the capacitances, and Table 2 shows the computing time and memory usage between DRT and FASTCAP from MIT <ref> [NW92] </ref> for the crossover structure as shown in Fig.3 (b). There are ground planes both at the top and the bottom of the crossover.

Reference-contexts: Table 3 4 shows the comparison of the capacitances, computing time and memory needs for a basic structure as shown in Fig.7. It can be seen DRT are about 5% less than the results from the closed-form formula <ref> [ST83] </ref>, and for this simple problem our method is also much fast than FASTCAP. Here, the permittivity is 3.9, the hight of the conductor over the ground plane is 1, the thickness and the width of the conductor are chosen to be 0.5 meter and 1 meter, respectively. 5. <p> Closed-form formulae generation based on the field solver 9 Conductor DRT FASTCAP Closed-form length in m Results in pF Results in pF Results <ref> [ST83] </ref> in pF 2 415 422 414 6 873 925 904 10 1357 1412 1395 Table 3: The comparison of capacitances for the plate problem Conductor DRT FASTCAP CPU time DRT FASTCAP Memory Use length CPU time CPU time F AST CAP DRT memory memory F AST CAP DRT 4 0.8
