Abstract: This is the final report of a study of the following issues in the implementation of entry and exit in an Automated Highway System (AHS): * Strategies for merging and leaving the AHS lane via the transition lane and via fl Work carried out under Federal Highway Administration Contract DTFH-61-93-C-001-99. This research was also supported in part by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) through the California PATH Program, Institute of Transportation Studies, University of California, Berkeley; and the National Science Foundation. The analysis reported here is largely the work of Datta Godbole, Anthony Hitchcock, Sonia Sachs and Pravin Varaiya. The simulations were carried out with the help of Ekta Singh, Farokh Eskafi and Delnaz Khorramabadi. We benefitted from consultations with Yusef Fawaz, Bret Michael, Bobby Rao, Markos Papageorgiou and Steve Shladover. Neither the Federal Highway Administration, Caltrans nor any of these people is responsible for the opinions expressed here, or for any remaining errors.

Reference-contexts: Achieving this coordination will, in our view, place significant demands on the layout of entry/exit and the placement and capabilities of sensors and communication infrastructure in the roadway and on vehicles. This accounts for the separate emphasis on the second feature. Based on earlier successful designs <ref> [1, 2] </ref> we have partitioned the coordination task into two functions: a logical function implemented by a communication protocol, and the actual longitudinal and lateral control implemented in feedback laws. This partition, of course, is not mandatory, and there are plausible alternatives. A detailed discussion appears in section 6.3. <p> Once an agreement is reached, the first vehicle at the stop sign forms a preplatoon of appropriate size and becomes its leader. Preplatoon formation is similar to `join' maneuver of <ref> [1] </ref> but it does not involve any control action by the regulation layer as the vehicles in the queue have the same velocity (zero m/sec) and required intra-platoon separation between them. <p> In this case, vehicles on TL will not form platoons. Once on the surface section of TL, the vehicles find themselves adjacent to an automated lane. At this point, they will execute `lane change' maneuver according to <ref> [1, 7, 10] </ref> to change lane to AL. The automated vehicles on AL that want to exit, will similarly change lane (after becoming a free agent) onto TL. The TL section ends into an exit ramp. <p> After the completion of the maneuver, the vehicle again will switch from transition lane to the automated behavior, which is completely described in <ref> [1] </ref>. car has received an acknowledgement to its entry-request and has formed the pre-platoon. automated lane. The simulation of exit maneuver follows the exit protocol described in Section 6.3. Figure 22 shows a frame of an animation when a vehicle is in the process of changing lane through a gate.

Reference-contexts: Achieving this coordination will, in our view, place significant demands on the layout of entry/exit and the placement and capabilities of sensors and communication infrastructure in the roadway and on vehicles. This accounts for the separate emphasis on the second feature. Based on earlier successful designs <ref> [1, 2] </ref> we have partitioned the coordination task into two functions: a logical function implemented by a communication protocol, and the actual longitudinal and lateral control implemented in feedback laws. This partition, of course, is not mandatory, and there are plausible alternatives. A detailed discussion appears in section 6.3. <p> The platoon organization provides vehicle spacings that are either small (intra-platoon spacing) or large (inter-platoon spacing). 8 For an overview of analytical, simulation and experimental evidence see <ref> [2] </ref> and the references cited therein. 14 Assumption 2: Strategies for coordination and control The entry of vehicles from the TL is coordinated with relevant vehicles on the AL by means of communication protocols that ensure safety and cause minimum disruption of flow on the ALs.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a large capacity is afforded by the platoon organization, with suitable coordination and control. The platoon organization also favors safety. A detailed comparison with other forms of traffic organization is presented in section 6.1. The essence of the argument, first presented in <ref> [3] </ref>, can be understood with the help of Figure 8. If two vehicles traveling at 20 m/s are initially separated by a distance d, and the first one decelerates at 10 m/s/s while the second decelerates at 7 m/s/s, they may collide. <p> Thus congestion is relieved. Nevertheless, it is recognized that mechanical failures of both vehicles and control systems are possible, though hopefully rare. With a greatly increased lane flow, such failures can credibly lead on to accidents in which many people are hurt. Shladover <ref> [3] </ref> pointed out that if a vehicle is following another which decelerates abruptly the resulting collision occurs at low relative speed if the vehicles are either well-separated or very close together. Large separations between all pairs is inconsistent with the desired capacity.

Reference-contexts: into the AL can be increased if a small number of vehicles can enter together as a pre-platoon. 11 Examples of remedial actions are: "exit if later exit is blocked," "slow down (or stop) if lane is blocked."

The automated vehicles on AL that want to exit, will similarly change lane (after becoming a free agent) onto TL. The TL section ends into an exit ramp. <p> This is quite a strong assumption as these quantities are usually known only approximately and might change with time, even for the same car. However it allows us to linearize the model by state feedback as discussed in the next section (see <ref> [7] </ref>). An adaptive version of the controller may be designed at a later stage to relax this assumption. The controller design was carried out in two stages, as outlined in Figure 16. <p> The conditions that characterize this class of systems can be found in the nonlinear systems literature (see <ref> [7] </ref> for references). The system (1)-(3), however, is simple enough to allow us to obtain the linearizing state feedback law by inspection, without having to go into the details of nonlinear control theory. <p> The control laws for the longitudinal motion of the cars on AL, namely cruise control and control laws for join, split and change lane maneuvers, are also developed by using this model. For details, refer to <ref> [7] </ref>. Lateral Dynamics A detailed model describing lateral dynamics of a vehicle is obtained in [13]. We use a simplified version of that model used in [13] for designing the "lane following" control law and in [10] for designing the "lane change" control law. <p> Cornering stiffness m; I z = Mass and moment of inertia about the yaw axis of the vehicle l 1 ; l 2 = Distances from center of gravity to front and rear axle Entry and exit under arrangement 2 can be carried out by the control laws developed in <ref> [7, 10, 13] </ref>. We now present control laws used for entry/exit under Arrangements 1, 3 and 4. Entrance onto AL 1. Stop sign regulation Law: This longitudinal control law is used on TL before the stop sign, along with the `lane keep' lateral control law of [13]. <p> In this section of the TL, all vehicles are operating as `free agents' under automatic control. The goal of this controller is to `safely' follow the preceding vehicle and eventually stop at the stop sign. Similar to the cruise control law of <ref> [7] </ref>, we define safe following distance on TL to be: d saf e = v _x i + p ; where v = 1s; p = 2m: The free agents 23 will follow each other with a constant time separation of one second. <p> Cruise Control law on TL: This control law is the default for the leader of the post-platoon. The aim of this controller is to follow the preceding vehicle with a safe inter-platoon separation. We use the cruise control law of <ref> [7] </ref> for this purpose. As the platoon leaders on AL are also following the same control law, the post-platoons on TL always remains longitudinally aligned with part of the parent platoon on AL, always remaining in its "shadow." 5. <p> Therefore, the aim of this control law is to convert every vehicle of the post-platoon into a free agent with an interplatoon gap suitable for human drivers to take over. (We use 2 seconds as a suitable inter-platoon gap). We make use of the lead control of <ref> [7] </ref>. Recall that the lead controller of [7] can be used for "split" maneuver as well (although it would take much longer than the "split" control law used in [7]). This maneuver is initiated for all vehicles of the post-platoon at the same time. <p> We make use of the lead control of <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The accuracy of 1 % may be more than required. Similarly, as indicated in Figure 11, a vehicle exiting from the AL and entering the ML must be aware of the presence of any vehicles on the XMS portion of the ML, devoted to the exit maneuver. 13 See <ref> [8] </ref> for a study that relates the time needed for entry via a change lane as a function of the flow on the inner AL and the flow of vehicles attempting entry. Also see section 6.5 for a queuing analysis. 20 Table 4: Instrument distribution. <p> Another advantage of platooning is that the capacity increases in proportion to the operating speed as can be seen from the above equation. 19 Furthermore it is shown in <ref> [8] </ref> that the capacity reduction due to lateral flow required for entry/exit is less than 10%. Thus amongst the various competing solutions for AHS, we choose platooning to be the preferred configuration. Segregation of automated and manual traffic The casualty rates that are acceptable are not currently defined.

Reference-contexts: Design of an exit strategy must follow the safety principle of Section 6.1 which requires the safe longitudinal vehicle following distance to be either very small (such as the intra-platoon separation of 2m on AL) or sufficiently large (such as inter-platoon separation on AL). It is also shown in <ref> [9] </ref> that high relative velocity collisions can occur if the preceding vehicle applies maximum braking and the trailing vehicle is following it with an intermediate spacing greater than 2 car lengths but less than the safe inter-platoon separation.

Stop sign regulation Law: This longitudinal control law is used on TL before the stop sign, along with the `lane keep' lateral control law of [13]. <p> We assume that the target platoon leader uses its radio transmitter to send its velocity and distance information to the preplatoon leader, at regular intervals. 3. Lane Change onto AL: We use control law presented in <ref> [10] </ref> to execute the lane change maneuver. The design of [10] is similar to the design of "accelerate to enter" control law presented above. In particular, a desired trajectory for the lateral position of the car is calculated and then feedback is used to asymptotically track this trajectory. <p> We assume that the target platoon leader uses its radio transmitter to send its velocity and distance information to the preplatoon leader, at regular intervals. 3.

The design of [10] is similar to the design of "accelerate to enter" control law presented above. In particular, a desired trajectory for the lateral position of the car is calculated and then feedback is used to asymptotically track this trajectory. The desired trajectory in this case is sinusoidal. <p> The following bounds on lateral acceleration and jerk are imposed in calculating the trajectory: a max = 0:05m=s 2 and j max = 0:1m=s 3 . In this case we want the entire preplatoon to change lane onto AL. We use the control law of <ref> [10] </ref> individually for each vehicle of the preplatoon to get the desired result. Note that the followers of the preplatoon cannot start executing the lane change control law until they have reached the gate. <p> These control laws have already been developed for platooning operation on AHS and will not be discussed any further. 41 Exit from AL 1. Lane Change onto TL: We use the control law of <ref> [10] </ref> to execute a lane change of a vehicle from AL onto TL. As only one vehicle changes lane through a gate at a given time, we can use the control law of [10] without any modifications. 2. <p> Lane Change onto TL: We use the control law of <ref> [10] </ref> to execute a lane change of a vehicle from AL onto TL.

Close Up on AL: This is the same control law as in the entry maneuver discussed above. 3.

Reference-contexts: In PFC a vehicle stays in a slot defined by the infrastructure, which moves along the AL. These slots 10-20 m long are moving along the highway. Each slot may or may not contain a vehicle. Safety Hitchcock <ref> [11] </ref> compares these competing strategies from the point of view of safety from mechanical failures. In the accidents he discusses, strings of vehicles respond to the initial incident by braking. Nevertheless collisions occur. One of the factors affecting the severity of injuries is the variability between vehicles. <p> Thus the generally negative conclusions we reach about AACC later are not due to pessimism here;. * PFC systems are controlled from the infrastructure. We therefore consider a delay of 0.09 s. Given these assumptions, a detailed study is conducted in <ref> [11] </ref> of effects of sudden braking by a vehicle on its followers. The distribution of vehicle masses and of friction coefficient values is taken to be random. <p> The end of a divider would itself be an obstacle which a vehicle can strike, come to rest and be struck by other vehicles. Thus, it is argued, dividers create more casualties than they prevent. On the other hand, Hitchcock <ref> [11] </ref> asserts that a divider is necessary to prevent the casualties which would otherwise occur in secondary accidents when a collision on the manual lanes intrudes on the ALs. With high-speed vehicles, such an occurrence would lead to multiple casualties. Further, the divider will not generate serious casualties. <p> Such an accident would interrupt traffic on the AL, but would generate no serious casualties. The secondary accidents prevented by the divider, however, would generate serious casualties. Hitchcock <ref> [11] </ref> analyzes the enumerated data about "relevant accidents" on a section of the Santa Monica freeway. These are accidents on the manual lanes as a result of which a vehicle is projected on to the leftmost lane, where the ALs would be. <p> Another possibility applies between ALs, or at the entry-gate, where the barrier has only to contain vehicles to a narrow lane. Here a low barrier, which will pass under the vehicle and slow it by causing it to plow through sand may perhaps be acceptable. Refer to <ref> [11] </ref> for different possible designs of barriers. 33 6.2 Infrastructure arrangement In this section, we present four different highway arrangements to arrange entry/exit from arterial streets (city/local streets) to AHS via either a transition lane or dedicated ramps. Arrangement 1 taken over by the AHS.

Reference-contexts: In each state, the FSM of the vehicle in turn, invokes a (precomputed) continuous time feedback control law.

Reference-contexts: For example, when a vehicle is in a manual lane, it has a manual behavior, and as soon as it enters a transition lane or an automated lane, it switches from the manual behavior to the transition or automated behavior, respectively. For a complete report on SmartPath see <ref> [16] </ref>. To simulate the entry and exit maneuvers, we modeled the "check-in" station, stop-light and its related sensors in the automated lane, and gates and their sensors individually. The simulation scenario we developed is as follows: A vehicle (we call it our-vehicle) enters the highway system from an entrance.
