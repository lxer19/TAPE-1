Abstract: In this paper we introduce fixed-phase retiming, an optimization technique for reducing the power dissipation of digital circuits without sacrificing their performance. In fixed-phase retiming, we first transform any given edge-triggered circuit into a two-phase level-clocked circuit by replacing each flip-flop by two level-sensitive latches. Subsequently, while keeping the latches clocked on one of the phases fixed, we relocate the remaining latches onto interconnections with high glitching activity and capacitive load. We formulate fixed-phase retiming as a boolean monotonic linear program and give an O(V 6 log V )- time algorithm for solving it, where V is the number of combinational blocks in the circuit.

Reference-contexts: Second, all quadratic terms in the objective PR have positive coefficients, assuming that the latch capacitance is smaller than the input capacitance of any combinational block, that is, C L C (i) for all i 2 E. A comprehensive comparison of the cells in the CMOS3 Cell Library <ref> [1] </ref> confirms that this assumption is reasonable. With the exception of a high impedance inverter whose input capacitance is comparable to that of a level-clocked latch, all other combinational blocks have higher input capaci tances than a level-clocked latch. We conclude this section with the following lemma.

Reference-contexts: The key to the linearization of the quadratic objective is that the coefficients of its quadratic terms are positive. Using a technique proposed by Hochbaum and Naor from <ref> [2] </ref> we can obtain an O (V 6 log V )-time algorithm for the problem. <p> The following lemma is used to obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for Problem FPR. Lemma 7 (Theorem 3.7, <ref> [2] </ref>) The integer optimal solution of a monotone linear system of inequalities with respect to an arbitrary linear objective can be computed in O (m ( i=1 jV i j) 2 log ( i=1 jV i j)) steps, where m is the number of inequalities, n is the number of variables, <p> We thus have jV i j = 2 for every variable x i , and the running time follows immediately from Lemma 7. We now present an efficient algorithm for solving Problem FPR which is based on the results of Hochbaum and Naor in <ref> [2] </ref>. The algorithm, given in Figure 5, first computes the objective and the set of constraints to obtain a boolean quadratic program. This boolean quadratic program is then linearized to obtain an instance of BMLP which is then solved using the algorithm due to Hochbaum-Naor [2]. <p> of Hochbaum and Naor in <ref> [2] </ref>. The algorithm, given in Figure 5, first computes the objective and the set of constraints to obtain a boolean quadratic program. This boolean quadratic program is then linearized to obtain an instance of BMLP which is then solved using the algorithm due to Hochbaum-Naor [2]. We conclude this section with the following theorem. Theorem 9 Algorithm SolveFPR solves Problem FPR in O (V 6 log V ) steps. Proof. From Lemma 4, we know that Problem FPR can be reduced to Problem BMQP with O (V ) variables and O (V 2 ) constraints.

Reference-contexts: Another objective of fixed-phase retiming is to reduce the number of latches in the circuit, thus reducing the power dissipated for storing data. Fixed-phase retiming has several advantages over conventional edge-triggered retiming as described in <ref> [3] </ref>. First, since the latches clocked on one phase are kept fixed, the values of the state variables of the synchronous circuit can still be obtained at the same interconnections. Therefore, the testability characteristics of the original design. edge-triggered circuit remain virtually unchanged. <p> Negative values of power reduction indicate an increase in power dissipation when a flip-flop is placed on an interconnection. This reduction in power dissipation can be achieved if the edge has a high glitching-capacitance product <ref> [3] </ref>. After replacing each edge-triggered flip-flop by two back-to-back level-clocked latches, the resulting circuit is fixed-phase retimed to obtain the circuit in Figure 3 (b). <p> Assuming that the rest of the network remains unchanged, the reduction in power dissipation is given by <ref> [3] </ref> p ET fanout i X u !v (1) The sum in Equation (1) has three terms. The first term E g (i) C (i) gives the reduction in power dissipation at the input of v due to masking. <p> The probability that a transition on edge i propagates to edge j is denoted by s j;i and is given by <ref> [3] </ref> s j;i = P rob (j l ji l) ; (2) where P rob (i l ji l) denotes the probability of a transition at edge j given that there is a transition at edge i.

Reference-contexts: It is known that unconstrained boolean quadratic programs with objectives in the form of Expression (18) and their corresponding linearized programs with objectives in the form of Expression (20) have the same optimum value <ref> [4] </ref>. We prove a similar result for boolean monotonic quadratic programs. Lemma 6 The optimum values of the objectives for Problem BMQP and Problem BMLP are equal. Proof.

Reference-contexts: We exploit this property in the next section to design a polynomial-time algorithm for fixed-phase retiming. The following lemma gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a retimed circuit G r to be properly timed by a given clocking scheme .
