Title: Similarity and Affine Distance Between Point Sets

Abstract: We develop the expressions for measuring the distance between 2D point sets, which are invariant to either 2D affine transformations or 2D similarity transformations of the sets, and assuming a known correspondence between the point sets. We discuss the image normalization to be applied to the images before their comparison so that the computed distance is symmetric with respect to the two images. We then give a general (metric) definition of the distance between images, which leads to the same expressions for the similarity and affine cases. This definition avoids ad-hoc decisions about normalization. Moreover, it makes it possible to compute the distance between images under different conditions, including cases where the images are treated asymmetrically. We demonstrate these results with real and simulated images.

Reference-contexts: Thus a natural distance between images matched up to similarity is the distance between their corresponding four-dimensional subspaces, and the distance between images matched up to affine transformation is the distance between their corresponding six-dimensional subspaces. We use the following distance between subspaces <ref> [2] </ref>: a subspace of R 2k can be identified with the matrix that corresponds to the linear operator of orthogonal projection into that subspace. The distance between subspaces is the norm of the difference between their corresponding projection matrices.

Reference-contexts: However, under the weak perspective (scaled orthographic) projection model assumed here, it is possible to remove the effects of certain camera transformations, such as rotations about the optical axis and translations. More specifically, there exist standard methods of image normalization with respect to the following image transformations <ref> [3] </ref>: Translations: the image is shifted so that its centroid is at the origin. Rotations: the image is rotated so that its principal axis has some standard orientation.
