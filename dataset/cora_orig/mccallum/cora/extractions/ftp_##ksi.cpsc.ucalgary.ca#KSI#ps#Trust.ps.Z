Title: Adapting to a Highly Automated World

Abstract: What is the nature of the engineering experience of our time? What is it like to be an engineer at the moment that the profession has achieved unprecedented successes, and simultaneously is being accused of having brought our civilization to the brink of ruin? This paper considers the role of technology in society and the concept of trust applied to technological systems. It analyzes the social and technical mechanisms existing for the containment of problems in terms of their capabilities to adapt to a highly automated world. Our adaption to the automated world that we have created requires engineering disciplines to formalize the social dimension of their activities as much as they have formalized the technological dimension. We can trust technology only to the extent that we can trust the engineering professions to accept the responsibility for this formalization. The complexity of modern technological systems and the social structures they serve is in danger of going beyond our conceptual capabilities to understand, anticipate and manage. A significant activity of all engineering professions must be to harness the power of modern information technology, of expert and knowledge-based systems, to enhance their abilities to model and manage the impacts of decisions falling within their professions.

If we treat technology as autonomous we forget its roots: Technology is the humans achievement, not his failingeven though the use he chooses to make of it may be fallen indeed.
