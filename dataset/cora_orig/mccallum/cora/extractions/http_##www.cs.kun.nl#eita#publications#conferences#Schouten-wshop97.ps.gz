Abstract: Imaging spectrometers acquire images in many narrow spectral bands. Because of the limited spatial resolution, often more than one ground cover category is present in a single pixel. In spectral mixture analysis the fractions of the ground cover categories present in a pixel are determined, assuming a linear mixture model. In this paper neural network methods which are able to perform this analysis are considered. Methods for the construction of training and test data sets for the neural network are given. Using data from 3 spectrometers with 6, 30 and 220 bands and 3 or 4 ground cover categories, it is shown that a back-propagation neural network with one hidden layer is able to learn the relation between the intensities of a pixel and its ground cover fractions. The distributions of the differences between true and calculated fractions show that a neural network performs the same or better than a conventional least squares with covariance matrix method. The calculation of the fractions by a neural network is much faster than by the least squares methods, training of the neural networks requires however a large amount of computer time.

Reference-contexts: This allows the construction of a mixture map, a series of images showing for each ground cover category its concentration over the area in the image. In spectral mixture analysis usually a linear mixture model <ref> [3] </ref> is used, the signal received for a pixel in band i is assumed to be: s i = j=1 where n is the total number of bands, R ij is the reflectance of the jth end-member (ground cover category) in the ith band, f j is the fraction of the

Reference-contexts: The input and output values were scaled linearly to the range -1.0 to 1.0. The transfer functions were taken as tanh for the hidden layers and linear for the output layer. The steepness of the transfer function was learned for each neuron <ref> [9] </ref>. The learning rate was varied by hand during learning, the momentum rate was typically set to 0.8. Learning was done in epoch mode but weights, biases and steepnesses were updated several times (typically 50) during each epoch.

Reference-contexts: On a sequential machine online learning is usually faster (that is: the weights with best results on the test data are quicker obtained) than epoch learning. On a parallel machine however different parallelization strategies <ref> [10] </ref> can be used for online and epoch learning, making the latter faster as less communication operations are needed.
