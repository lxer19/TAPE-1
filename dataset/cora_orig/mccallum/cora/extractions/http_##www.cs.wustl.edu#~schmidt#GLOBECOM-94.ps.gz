Abstract: An earlier version of this paper appeared in the proceedings of the IEEE GLOBECOM conference, November 27 th to December 1 st , 1994. Abstract Developing extensible, robust, and efficient distributed applications is a complex task. To help alleviate this complexity, we have developed the ADAPTIVE Service eXecutive (ASX) framework. ASX is an object-oriented framework composed of automated tools and reusable C++ components. These tools and components simplify the development, configuration, and reconfiguration of distributed applications in a heterogeneous environment. Using ASX applications may be configured dynamically to contain multiple network services that execute concurrently in one or more processes or threads. Components in the ASX framework have been ported to UNIX and Windows NT and are currently being used in a number of large-scale production distributed systems. This paper describes our experience gained using the ASX framework to build highly modular, reusable, and extensible software for a family of distributed system management applications.
