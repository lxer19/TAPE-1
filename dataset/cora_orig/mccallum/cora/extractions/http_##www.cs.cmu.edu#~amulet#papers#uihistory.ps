It is important to appreciate that years of research are involved in creating and making these technologies ready for widespread use. <p> An early C++ toolkit was InterViews [21] , developed at Stanford (1988, industrial funding). Much of the modern research is being performed at universities, for example the Garnet (1988) [28] and Amulet (1994) [27] projects at CMU (ARPA funded), and subArctic at Georgia Tech <ref> (1996, funding by Intel and NSF) </ref>.

Timothy Johnsons pioneering work on the interactive 3D CAD system Sketchpad 3 [13] was his 1963 MIT MS thesis (funded by Brief History of HCI - 7 the Air Force).

HyperCard from Apple (1988) significantly helped to bring the idea to a wide audience. There have been many other hypertext systems through the years. Tim Berners-Lee used the hypertext idea to create the World Wide Web in 1990 at the government-funded European Particle Physics Laboratory (CERN).

Reference-contexts: HyperText : The idea for hypertext (where documents are linked to related documents) is credited to Vannevar Bushs famous MEMEX idea from 1945 [4] . Ted Nelson coined the term hypertext in 1965 <ref> [29] </ref> . Engelbarts NLS system [8] at the Stanford Research Laboratories in 1965 made extensive use of linking (funding from ARPA, NASA, and Rome ADC). The NLS Journal [10, p. 212] was one of the first online journals, and it included full linking of articles (1970).

Reference-contexts: SketchPad supported the manipulation of objects using a light-pen, including grabbing objects, moving them, changing size, and using constraints. It contained the seeds of myriad important interface ideas. The system was built at Lincoln Labs with support from the Air Force and NSF. William Newmans Reaction Handler <ref> [30] </ref> , created at Imperial College, London (1966-67) provided direct manipulation of graphics, and introduced Light Handles, a form of graphical potentiometer, that was probably the first widget. Another early system was AMBIT/G (implemented at MITs Lincoln Labs, 1968, ARPA funded). <p> For a more complete survey and discussion of UI tools, see [26] . UIMSs and Toolkits: (There are software libraries and tools that support creating interfaces by writing code.) The first User Interface Management System (UIMS) was William Newmans Reaction Handler <ref> [30] </ref> created at Imperial College, London (1966-67 with SRC funding). Most of the early work was done at universities (Univ. of Toronto with Canadian government funding, George Washington Univ. with NASA, NSF, DOE, and NBS funding, Brigham Young University with industrial funding, etc.).

Reference-contexts: The Cedar Window Manager from Xerox PARC was the first major tiled window manager (1981) [45] , followed soon by the Andrew window manager <ref> [32] </ref> by Carnegie Mellon Universitys Information Technology Center (1983, funded by IBM). The main commercial systems popularizing windows were the Xerox Star (1981), the Apple Lisa (1982), and most importantly the Apple Macintosh (1984). <p> Now there are literally hundreds of commercial interface builders. Component Architectures: The idea of creating interfaces by connecting separately written components was first demonstrated in the Andrew project <ref> [32] </ref> by Carnegie Mellon Universitys Information Technology Center (1983, funded by IBM). It is now being widely popularized by Microsofts OLE and Apples OpenDoc architectures. 6.

See, for example, <ref> [34] </ref> for a survey of the early work. 5. Software Tools and Architectures The area of user interface software tools is quite active now, and many companies are selling tools.

Reference-contexts: As computers get faster, more of the processing power is being devoted to the user interface.
