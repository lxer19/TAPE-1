Schmidt. </author> <title> An algorithm for piecewise linear approximation of an implicitly defined manifold. </title> <journal> SIAM Journal of Numerical Analysis, </journal> <volume> 22 </volume> <pages> 322-346, </pages> <month> April </month> <year> 1985. </year>
Reference-contexts: The free variables in the optimization are the number of vertices in the mesh, their connectivity, and their positions. Phase 3: piecewise smooth surface optimization (Chapter 4 and <ref> [1] </ref>): In phase 3, the surface representation is changed from a piecewise linear one (meshes) to a piecewise smooth one. We introduce of a new piecewise smooth representation based on subdivision. <p> section discretely samples the function ~ d U over a portion of a 3-dimensional grid near the data and reconstructs a continuous piecewise linear approximation to Z ( ~ d U ). 2.2.5 Contour tracing Contour tracing, the extraction of an isosurface from a scalar function, is a well-studied problem <ref> [1, 13, 76] </ref>. Most contour tracing algorithms partition space into cubes or simplices (tetrahedra), evaluate the scalar function at the vertices of these volume elements, and for each element, from the values at its vertices, infer a linear approximation to the surface. <p> Phase 1 currently uses the algorithm of Wyvill et al. [76], because it is simple to implement and, unlike the standard marching cubes algorithm [34], does not suffer from ambiguous configurations. Also, it produces sparser representations (for a given accuracy) than the method of Allgower and Schmidt <ref> [1] </ref> which uses tetrahedral decompositions of cubes. (A disadvantage of the method of Wyvill et al. is that it does not generalize to higher dimensions.) In our implementation of the algorithm of Wyvill et al., we handle degenerate zero evaluations ( ~ d U (p) = 0) by arbitrarily perturbing them

Reference-contexts: Sclaroff and Pentland [65] describe a hybrid implicit/parametric surface fitting method that involves fitting a function over a deformed superquadric. Some recent work under the title surfaces on surfaces addresses the case when D is a general curved surface such as the skin of an airplane <ref> [2, 46] </ref>. Function reconstruction methods can be used for surface reconstruction in simple, special cases, where the surface to be reconstructed is, roughly speaking, the graph of a function over a known surface D. <p> The goal of this phase is to determine the topological type of the surface, and to produce an initial estimate of its geometry. Phase 2: mesh optimization (Chapter 3 and <ref> [3, 2] </ref>): Starting with the dense mesh created in phase 1, phase 2 reduces the number of faces and improves the fit to the data points (Figure 1.4c). <p> While there has been extensive research in the approximation of scalar functions over manifolds of simple topological type, extending this work to manifolds of arbitrary topological type is still a relatively unexplored area. The recent surfaces on surfaces work <ref> [2, 46] </ref> addresses this problem. Another approach is to view this problem as the reconstruction of a surface in R 6 , where the data points have coordinates (x; y; z; r; g; b).

Reference-contexts: The goal of this phase is to determine the topological type of the surface, and to produce an initial estimate of its geometry. Phase 2: mesh optimization (Chapter 3 and <ref> [3, 2] </ref>): Starting with the dense mesh created in phase 1, phase 2 reduces the number of faces and improves the fit to the data points (Figure 1.4c). <p> Therefore the number of contour tracing cubes occupied by the n data points is proportional to n. Thus this problem would also require O (n 2 ) if implemented by brute force. Hierarchical spatial partitioning schemes such as octrees [55] and k-D trees <ref> [3] </ref> can greatly speed up these spatial searching problems. As we assume uniform sampling density in our data, a simpler scheme, based on uniform cubic partitioning, has worked effectively. The axis-aligned bounding box of the points is partitioned by a cubical grid.

Reference-contexts: However, this type of digitization requires significant human intervention. Recently, mechanical probes are being replaced by laser range scanners. Laser range scanners illuminate the object with a laser beam, and measure distance using either triangulation, interference, or time-of-flight principles (for an extensive survey of range imaging sensors, see Besl <ref> [4] </ref>). Laser range scanners are promising because they can provide dense, accurate range data at high bandwidths. Range scanning systems typically produce range imagesrectangular grids of distances from the sensor to the object being scanned. <p> Our reconstruction method consists of three successive phases, as illustrated in Figures 1.3 and 1.4. Phase 1: initial surface estimation (Chapter 2 and <ref> [4] </ref>): From an unorganized set of points (Figure 1.4a), phase 1 constructs an initial dense mesh (Figure 1.4b). The goal of this phase is to determine the topological type of the surface, and to produce an initial estimate of its geometry.

Reference-contexts: To allow the development of more portable and inexpensive scanning systems, an alternative is to only coarsely position the scanhead and to let software perform the task of accurately registering the data <ref> [5, 72] </ref>. Furthermore, for hand-held scanners to become commercially successful, reconstruction algorithms should be real-time and on-line. Even the current phase 1 execution times would 110 require improvements in speed of several orders of magnitude.

Reference-contexts: Thus there has been extensive work in various application areas to attempt to reduce the size of the output in regions where it is unnecessary. For instance, many methods adapt the density of the representation using heuristic estimates of curvature <ref> [6, 56, 71] </ref>. However, in general these heuristic methods are tedious to implement and produce results that are far from optimal. Another approach to finding a concise surface approximation is to first generate a dense approximation, and then simplify it.

Reference-contexts: Parametric reconstruction methods Parametric methods represent the reconstructed surface as an embedding f (fl) R 3 of a 2-dimensional parameter domain fl. Previous work has concentrated on domain spaces with simple topological type, i.e. the plane and the sphere. Hastie and Stuetzle [27], and Bolle and Vemuri <ref> [7] </ref> discuss reconstruction of surfaces by a topological embedding f (fl) of a planar region fl into R 3 . Brinkley [9] considers the reconstruction of surfaces that are slightly deformed spheres, and thus chooses fl to be an approximation to a sphere.

Reference-contexts: In manufacturing, similar stacks of contours are also produced by cross-section CAT scans of mechanical parts. The surfaces from contours problem attempts to recover the three-dimensional structures from the stacks of parallel two-dimensional contours. Although the problem has received a good deal of attention <ref> [8, 39, 40] </ref>, there remain severe limitations with current methods. Perhaps foremost among these is the difficulty of automatically dealing with branching structures. While algorithms addressing the general surface reconstruction problem may not be as successful as methods specialized for contour data, they need not consider such special cases.

Reference-contexts: Digital elevation data typically takes the form of a dense rectangular grid of height values. Such data can be visualized as a surface by defining a dense mesh over the set of 3D data points. To obtain a more concise mesh, some simplification methods <ref> [10, 15, 63] </ref> select as vertices only a subset of the points and obtain an accurate surface by optimizing over the connectivity of these vertices. More recent work allows for movement of the mesh vertices and simplification of the mesh based on computed estimates of curvature [56].

A subdivision scheme based on triangles is most convenient for our purposes.

Reference-contexts: are elongated along directions of low curvature, another property recognized as desirable by Turk. 5.2.3 Data dependent triangulations In a related problem called data dependent triangulation, the goal is to fit meshes to data defined as a function over the plane (z = f (x; y)) (see Dyn and Rippa <ref> [16] </ref> for a review). This problem can be viewed as a specialized instance of mesh simplification, in which the meshes are restricted to project one-to-one onto the xy plane. A common instance of the data dependent triangulation problem involves the modeling of elevation data.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the convex hull equals the ff-hull with ff = 1. Edelsbrunner and M ucke also introduce the alpha shape (ff-shape), obtained by substituting simplicial elements (segments and triangles) for the curved boundary elements of the ff-hull. More recently, Edelsbrunner <ref> [17] </ref> has extended this notion to weighted alpha shapes, in which the data points can be assigned scalar weights to cope with non-uniform samplings. The ff-shape approach has great potential in addressing the general surface reconstruction problem.

Reference-contexts: They find meshes of arbitrary topological type that interpolate sets of unorganized points. Since they interpolate the data, their main limitation is that they require the data to be noise-free. Edelsbrunner and M ucke <ref> [18] </ref> generalize the notion of convex hull to that of alpha hull (ff-hull). The convex hull of a set X can be thought of as the complement of the union of all half-spaces not containing X.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the probe is able to generate many sets of contours from different directions and from different positions. Algorithms for solving the surfaces from contours problem cannot be easily applied to this type of data. 6 1.2.3 Surface sketching A number of researchers, including Schneider [59] and Eisenman <ref> [19] </ref>, have investigated the creation of curves in R 2 by tracing the path of a stylus or mouse as the user sketches the desired shape.

Reference-contexts: However, NURBS can only represent surfaces of arbitrary topological type by partitioning the model into a collection of individual NURBS patches. Adjacent patches must then be explicitly stitched together using geometric continuity conditions <ref> [20] </ref>. A large number of parameters (the B-spline coefficients) are therefore introduced, most of which are constrained by the continuity conditions. As a consequence, fitting NURBS surfaces in general requires high-dimensional constrained optimization. Subdivision surfaces, first introduced by Doo/Sabin [14] and Catmull/Clark [11], offer a promising alternative.

Reference-contexts: It may be possible, as a post-process, to flatten such an ff-shape into a surface. 10 Favardin <ref> [21] </ref> presents a modified gift-wrapping algorithm for triangulating a set of points. Gift-wrapping is a standard algorithm from computational geometry for computing the convex hull of a set of points. It creates a triangulation by successively pivoting planes about boundary edges of the triangulation until these plane encounter other points.

Reference-contexts: An important feature of the matrix A is that it contains at most 3 non-zero entries in each row, for a total of O (n + m) non-zero entries. The least squares problem is solved using the conjugate gradient method (cf. Golub and Van Loan <ref> [24] </ref>). This is an iterative method guaranteed to find the exact solution in as many iterations as there are distinct singular values of A, i.e. in at most m iterations. Usually far fewer iterations are required to get a result with acceptable precision.

Reference-contexts: In most cases closed form expressions for the limit surfaces are not known, but somewhat surprisingly, various properties of subdivision surfaces, such as exact points on the surface and exact tangent planes, can nonetheless be computed <ref> [26] </ref>. <p> Equation 4.2 suggests that the limit point can be obtained by analyzing the eigenstructure of the local subdivision matrix. Indeed, the limit point can be expressed as an affine combination of the initial vertex positions <ref> [26] </ref>: v 1 = 1 + ` n v 0 ` 0 + ` 1 + ` n where (` 0 ; :::; ` n ) is the dominant left eigenvector of S n . <p> Eigenanalysis of the local subdivision matrix can also be used to establish smoothness. It can be shown, for instance, that Loop's surfaces are indeed tangent plane continuous [33, 52]. Moreover, Halstead et al. <ref> [26] </ref> show that the tangent vectors to the limit surface at v 1 can be computed using the two left eigenvectors of S n corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue (this eigenvalue has multiplicity 2).

Reference-contexts: The new surface representation generalizes Loop's subdivision surface scheme <ref> [33] </ref> by introducing additional subdivision rules that allow the modeling of sharp surface features such as creases and corners. * It presents an algorithm (phase 3) for fitting piecewise smooth surfaces to sets of points. <p> Subdivision surfaces are capable of modeling everywhere smooth surfaces of arbitrary topological type using a small number of unconstrained parameters. Our new surface representation is a generalization of the subdivision surface scheme introduced by Loop <ref> [33] </ref>. Loop's scheme, like all subdivision schemes to date, produces tangent plane continuous surfaces of arbitrary topological type. A principal contribution of our work is to show that it is possible to locally modify Loop's subdivision rules to model sharp features such as creases and corners. <p> A subdivision scheme based on triangles is most convenient for our purposes. We use a generalization of the triangular scheme introduced by Loop <ref> [33] </ref>, as it is the simplest known scheme leading to tangent plane smooth surfaces. 4.2.1 Loop's subdivision surface scheme Loop's subdivision scheme is a generalization of C 2 quartic triangular B-splines. <p> For Loop's surfaces this affine combination can be expressed as the position mask shown in Figure 4.8a <ref> [33] </ref>. 8a (n) , and where c i = cos (2i=n). Eigenanalysis of the local subdivision matrix can also be used to establish smoothness. It can be shown, for instance, that Loop's surfaces are indeed tangent plane continuous [33, 52]. <p> Eigenanalysis of the local subdivision matrix can also be used to establish smoothness. It can be shown, for instance, that Loop's surfaces are indeed tangent plane continuous <ref> [33, 52] </ref>. Moreover, Halstead et al. [26] show that the tangent vectors to the limit surface at v 1 can be computed using the two left eigenvectors of S n corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue (this eigenvalue has multiplicity 2).

Reference-contexts: Many previous reconstruction methods assume that such orientation information is supplied with the data. When the data points X are obtained from volumetric data, the gradient of this data can provide orientation information that helps guide the reconstruction.

One approach to controlling the topological type of an implicit surface is to triangulate space and define a piecewise algebraic function of low degree over the resulting simplices. 11 Moore and Warren <ref> [42] </ref> use a piecewise polynomial function of degree 3. By keeping the degree low and using additional volumetric samples (Section 1.3.3), they are able to avoid extraneous surface sheets when the data is dense and nearly linear within each simplex.

Surface approximations for parts and groups of parts should be allowed to change topologically at various levels (as in the method of Rossignac and Borrel <ref> [53] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Therefore the number of contour tracing cubes occupied by the n data points is proportional to n. Thus this problem would also require O (n 2 ) if implemented by brute force. Hierarchical spatial partitioning schemes such as octrees <ref> [55] </ref> and k-D trees [3] can greatly speed up these spatial searching problems. As we assume uniform sampling density in our data, a simpler scheme, based on uniform cubic partitioning, has worked effectively. The axis-aligned bounding box of the points is partitioned by a cubical grid.

Reference-contexts: Thus there has been extensive work in various application areas to attempt to reduce the size of the output in regions where it is unnecessary. For instance, many methods adapt the density of the representation using heuristic estimates of curvature <ref> [6, 56, 71] </ref>. However, in general these heuristic methods are tedious to implement and produce results that are far from optimal. Another approach to finding a concise surface approximation is to first generate a dense approximation, and then simplify it. <p> More recent work allows for movement of the mesh vertices and simplification of the mesh based on computed estimates of curvature <ref> [56] </ref>. Since this problem is an instance of the mesh simplification problem, we can apply mesh optimization. As an example, from a terrain mesh of 1200 fi 1200 vertices 2 , we obtain the much coarser mesh (6,848 vertices) shown in Figure 5.3.

Reference-contexts: Digital elevation data typically takes the form of a dense rectangular grid of height values. Such data can be visualized as a surface by defining a dense mesh over the set of 3D data points. To obtain a more concise mesh, some simplification methods <ref> [10, 15, 63] </ref> select as vertices only a subset of the points and obtain an accurate surface by optimizing over the connectivity of these vertices. More recent work allows for movement of the mesh vertices and simplification of the mesh based on computed estimates of curvature [56].

Reference-contexts: Subdivision surfaces produced by the new rules are tangent plane smooth everywhere except along creases and at corners. A detailed theoretical analysis of the behavior along creases and at corners is beyond the scope of this thesis and will be presented by Schweitzer and Duchamp <ref> [64] </ref>. In Section 4.3.2 we summarize the relevant results of the analysis. 4.3.1 Subdivision rules To model creases, corners, and darts using subdivision surfaces, a subset L of edges in the simplicial complex K is tagged as sharp. We refer to the pair (K; L) as a tagged simplicial complex. <p> For crease vertices of valence 4 or higher, the subdivision rules described in the previous section give rise to well-defined tangent planes on both sides of the crease <ref> [64] </ref>. 3 As for smooth vertices, tangent masks are again determined by the two left eigen-vectors corresponding to the 2nd and 3rd largest eigenvalues. For both regular and non-regular crease vertices, a tangent along the crease is obtained by the tangent mask shown in Figure 4.12c. <p> For both regular and non-regular crease vertices, a tangent along the crease is obtained by the tangent mask shown in Figure 4.12c.

At a regular crease vertex, the valence is 4 and the mask is given by (w 0 ; :::; w 4 ) = (2; 1; 2; 2; 1).

Sclaroff and Pentland <ref> [65] </ref> describe a hybrid implicit/parametric surface fitting method that involves fitting a function over a deformed superquadric. Some recent work under the title surfaces on surfaces addresses the case when D is a general curved surface such as the skin of an airplane [2, 46].

Reference-contexts: A simplicial complex K consists of a set of simplices f1g; : : : ; fmg, called vertices, together with a set of simplices formed by unions of these vertices, such that every non-empty subset of a simplex in K is again a simplex in K (cf. Spanier <ref> [66] </ref>). The 1-simplices fi; jg 2 K are called edges, and the 2-simplices fi; j; kg 2 K are called faces. A geometric realization of a mesh as a surface in R 3 can be obtained as follows.

Reference-contexts: These schemes are designed to interpolate sparse data, rather than to fit dense, noisy point sets of the type obtained from range scanners. Some more recent examples include Veltkamp [73] and Szeliski et al. <ref> [67] </ref>. Function reconstruction Terms like surface fitting appear in reference to two distinct classes of problems: surface reconstruction and function reconstruction. The goal of surface reconstruction was stated earlier.

Reference-contexts: For example, algorithms for reconstructing surfaces from range data typically exploit the fact that each surface point x i is known to be visible from the sensor, and make use of these direction vectors in orienting the surface. Szeliski and Tonnesen <ref> [68] </ref> reconstruct a surface using an optimization problem involving oriented particles. By local interaction, these particles align themselves on a 2-dimensional manifold. The initial orientations of the particles is crucial to the success of their method, and must be specified as input.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, the neighborhood should be defined as the union of all ff-spheres incident to both vertices of the edge. 1.3.5 Implicit surface fitting algorithms Several methods fit algebraic implicit surfaces (zero sets of polynomial functions) to sets of points <ref> [50, 69] </ref>. However, the intent of these methods is not to reconstruct surfaces but to either recognize objects or infer their orientations in a scene.

Reference-contexts: By keeping the degree low and using additional volumetric samples (Section 1.3.3), they are able to avoid extraneous surface sheets when the data is dense and nearly linear within each simplex. Taubin and Ronfard <ref> [70] </ref> use a piecewise linear function in their implicit simplicial model representation. The topological type of their surface is easy to predict, since the degree 1 algebraic surface can have at most one surface sheet within each simplex. <p> Q.E.D. 26 Since our graph optimization problem is NP-hard, no solution method can guarantee finding its exact solution in reasonable time. One approach to approximating the solution is to use a simulated annealing method. For instance, Taubin and Ronfard <ref> [70] </ref> encounter a similar graph problem when determining signs in their implicit curve reconstruction method. They discover that this discrete optimization problem has a physically-based counterpart, the Ising model of large populations of particles with spin, for which simulated annealing schemes are well documented.

Reference-contexts: Thus there has been extensive work in various application areas to attempt to reduce the size of the output in regions where it is unnecessary. For instance, many methods adapt the density of the representation using heuristic estimates of curvature <ref> [6, 56, 71] </ref>. However, in general these heuristic methods are tedious to implement and produce results that are far from optimal. Another approach to finding a concise surface approximation is to first generate a dense approximation, and then simplify it. <p> As an example, from the dense mesh in Figure 5.1, we want to obtain the much coarser one shown on the upper right. 90 5.2.1 Previous work Some notable papers discussing the mesh simplification problem are Schroeder et al. [60], Turk <ref> [71] </ref>, Rossignac and Borrel [53], and Lounsbery et al. [35]. The motivation of Schroeder et al. [60] is to simplify meshes generated by marching cubes that may consist of millions of triangles. <p> It is worthwhile noting that this criterion only considers deviation of the new mesh from the mesh created in the previous iteration; deviation from the original mesh does not figure in the strategy. The goal of Turk <ref> [71] </ref> is to reduce the amount of detail in a mesh while remaining faithful to the original topology and geometry.

Reference-contexts: Although the resulting data contains structure within each range image, merging the data to reconstruct a useful surface representation is a non-trivial task <ref> [38, 72] </ref>. 3D scanning applications The development of fast, inexpensive 3D scanning systems opens up a vast range of applications, including: Reverse engineering: Computer-aided designs often begin with a physical object. <p> Turk and Levoy <ref> [72] </ref> describe a mesh zippering approach, in which overlapping surfaces (the range images) are stitched together. These approaches have the drawback that they must deal with special cases using ad hoc techniques. It is therefore difficult to apply them to similar but different problems. <p> To allow the development of more portable and inexpensive scanning systems, an alternative is to only coarsely position the scanhead and to let software perform the task of accurately registering the data <ref> [5, 72] </ref>. Furthermore, for hand-held scanners to become commercially successful, reconstruction algorithms should be real-time and on-line. Even the current phase 1 execution times would 110 require improvements in speed of several orders of magnitude.

Reference-contexts: These schemes are designed to interpolate sparse data, rather than to fit dense, noisy point sets of the type obtained from range scanners. Some more recent examples include Veltkamp <ref> [73] </ref> and Szeliski et al. [67]. Function reconstruction Terms like surface fitting appear in reference to two distinct classes of problems: surface reconstruction and function reconstruction. The goal of surface reconstruction was stated earlier. <p> As T progressively shrinks, the boundary mesh B (T ) interpolates an increasing number of data points. In deciding which tetrahedron to remove next from T i , O'Rourke [48] uses a criterion based on minimal area of B (T i+1 ), and Veltkamp <ref> [73] </ref> uses a criterion based on maximal interior angle of B (T i ). However, these methods are restricted in that they always produce a closed surface of genus zero. 1.3.2 Algorithms exploiting structure information Many surface reconstruction algorithms exploit structure in the data.

Reference-contexts: More generally, one may want to recover lighting-independent surface reflectance properties, so that the model can then be simulated in other lighting environments. Specialized instruments have been designed to measure bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDF's) <ref> [74] </ref>, but one can envision inferring such reflectance information directly from 3D scanner data.

Reference-contexts: Any barycentric coordinate vector has at most three non-zero entries; it has only two non-zero entries if it lies on an edge of jKj, and only one if it is a vertex. Our implementation represents the simplicial complex using a half-edge data structure (cf. Weiler <ref> [75] </ref>). Points stored at vertices of this data structure determine the geometric realization of the mesh. 1.7.2 Neighborhoods on meshes It is also useful to define neighborhoods on a simplicial complex. <p> In phases 2 and 3, the current implementation requires the surfaces to be orientable only because of the current half-edge data structure used to represent meshes <ref> [75] </ref>. Using a different data structure would remove this restriction. Higher dimensional manifolds In principle, the phase 1 algorithm can be extended to reconstruct manifolds of co-dimension one in spaces of arbitrary dimension; that is, to reconstruct (k 1) dimensional manifolds in k dimensional space.
