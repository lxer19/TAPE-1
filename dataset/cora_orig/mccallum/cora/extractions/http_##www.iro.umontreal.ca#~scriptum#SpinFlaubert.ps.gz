Abstract: This paper argues for more precise definitions of rhetorical relations that have often been proposed as intermediate forms between modules of text generators. As a case in point, we describe the problems we encountered when we combined two text generator systems that we initially thought were complementary: one dealt with "what to say?" and the other with the "how to say?". This experiment brought new insights into the generation process.

Reference-contexts: One of the best known and often encountered proposition for computing the text structure, is the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST)[7] formalism, first used and adapted by Hovy <ref> [4] </ref> and then followed by many other researchers. The rhetorical relations are interpreted as plan operators in a goal-oriented planning paradigm to achieve text structuration. Texts are thus structured in a bottom-up approach contrarily to predefined rhetorical patterns such as the ones used by McKeown [9]. <p> compares 4 different levels of representation computed in the process of text generation. 3 We also experimented by connecting our two systems by mapping the rhetorical relations of SPIN (arrow 2 of choices for which it has been designed to do had already been done by SPIN. 6 SPIN Hovy <ref> [4] </ref> FLAUBERT Delin [3] Planning + + - + Conceptual structure Gross level + + - Fine level - + + Rhetorical structure of target language + + - ?

Reference-contexts: Moore and Pollack [12] also argue that RST presumes that there will be a preferred rhetoric relation holding between discourse elements while discourse elements are related simultaneously on multiple levels, e.g. informational and intentional levels. 1 Some solutions have been proposed to this problem: Kittredge et al. <ref> [5] </ref> have proposed adding more precise domain communication knowledge to inform the generator for generating better texts.

Reference-contexts: In the context of instructional texts, Kosseim <ref> [6] </ref> has developed the SPIN (Systme de Planification d'INtructions) text generator in which an intermediate semantic level is added to avoid the planning of instructions in linguistic terms. Semantic relations are then mapped to rhetorical relations following rules that have been extracted by a corpus study of instructional texts. <p> This is the first time such an experiment is reported and our result illustrates the "generation gap" and makes a supplementary point for the need for more precise definitions of rhetorical relations. 2 Description of the two text generators SPIN <ref> [6] </ref>, developed at the Universit de Montral, is aimed at the "What to say" part of the generation process namely in the separation of semantic and rhetorical concerns in the context of instructional texts. <p> We saw this combination as a sort of "psychological study"with two automatic generators that we could study in detail. We think this is the first time such an experiment is reported. 2.1 Description of SPIN SPIN <ref> [6] </ref> generates instructional texts from a conceptual representation of the task 2 .

Reference-contexts: in natural language processing and in knowledge representation: do those two texts really represent the same conceptual relations? Thus we can see that a semantic relation in a system has not exactly the same meaning in another, this is a good illustration of the generation gap best described by Meeter <ref> [10] </ref> where a text planner has to be aware of the linguistic consequences of the choices it made. So it is difficult to separate the generation process into independent modules; but nevertheless nearly all generation systems do make that division [14].
