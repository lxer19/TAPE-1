Title: The Conceptual and Linguistic Facets of Persuasive Arguments  
Author: Daniel Marcu 
Abstract: This paper provides a body of knowledge that characterizes persuasive arguments, which is thoroughly grounded in empirical data derived from communication studies, psychology, and social studies of persuasion. The paper also discusses the limitations of current theories of argumentation and systems in accommodating both the conceptual and linguistic facets of persuasive arguments.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, linguistic accounts were interested more in capturing the relation between linguistic cues and certain argumentative structures [5, 8] than the actual linguistic realization of the arguments. An exception to this, is Anscombre and Ducrot's approach <ref> [1] </ref>, which depicts a semantic theory in which some words carry besides the usual semantic meaning, an argumentative connotation that orients the argumentative interpretation and the continuation of a discourse independently of the informative content it may carry.

Reference-contexts: The receiver's interest affects the argument selection as well: if it is high, the NLG system should select only sound arguments; if it is low, the system should select as many arguments as possible, even if they are unsound, because this will have a better effect on the receiver <ref> [12, 2] </ref>. A key factor is the system's ability to reason about the beliefs of the recipient and to determine those that support the goal of the message and those that contradict it. <p> Communication studies emphasize further the role that structure plays, because although the understanding of a message decreases smoothly as the same semantic information is presented in a less and less structured way, the persuasive effects vanish rapidly <ref> [2] </ref>. In persuasive argumentation, one should capture the attention of the audience by making the message unusual, by presenting the arguments in a novel way [17]. <p> Lexical choice in general plays an important role in persuasive argumentation. One way to increase persuasiveness is by eliminating all the qualifiers that express uncertainty, such as perhaps, maybe or possibly. The use of metaphors [12], "stronger" language and "pathetic" words <ref> [2] </ref>, and specific terms instead of abstract terms [18, p. 142] increases the degree of persuasiveness. In my ongoing example, these recommendations will make us prefer cancer sticks over cigarettes; messy over detrimental, and bucks over money.

Reference-contexts: Independent of the mathematical abstractions that they use, conceptual approaches derive their strength from the careful characterization of the structures (trees and graphs) that pertain to sound arguments <ref> [18, 3, 5, 11] </ref>: their understanding is shown to yield certain conclusions independent of the propositions that they relate [3] and to alleviate semantic ambiguities [8]. <p> Independent of the mathematical abstractions that they use, conceptual approaches derive their strength from the careful characterization of the structures (trees and graphs) that pertain to sound arguments [18, 3, 5, 11]: their understanding is shown to yield certain conclusions independent of the propositions that they relate <ref> [3] </ref> and to alleviate semantic ambiguities [8]. <p> Argument realization. My review of persuasive argumentation (section 2) has revealed a number of lexical characteristics that cannot be incorporated easily in current theories of argumentation. On one hand, conceptual schemata <ref> [18, 3, 5] </ref> seem to be too abstract for dealing with the differences between more or less intensely worded arguments, and for explaining the impact that the use of strong language, specific terms, and denotative, spatial, and temporal specific terms has on an argument.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, it comes as no surprise that replacing quantitative qualifiers with qualitative qualifiers that are prescribed by socio-linguistic research is a heuristic that can be used for increasing persuasiveness [9]. Socio-linguistic research <ref> [4] </ref> prescribes for some audiences, for example, the use of virtually always or high probability instead of 99%, and unlikely or doubtful instead of 20%. Lexical choice in general plays an important role in persuasive argumentation.

Reference-contexts: Recent research in the field of behavioral decision making [9] shows that persuasion is not a constant function of the beliefs and attitudes, but that it rather varies depending on the stage of change that the recipient is in. In the stages-of-change model for example <ref> [6, 9] </ref>, there are five stages that range from precontemplative, the stage in which the recipient does not recognize the problem or the need for a change, to maintenance, the stage in which the recipient has maintained a new behavior for more than six months.

Reference-contexts: Argument organization. As far as I know, research in argumentation has been concerned only with the structure of single arguments; and likewise, NLG systems that provide explanations and advice <ref> [7, 11] </ref> don't explore the planning mechanisms that would account for the generation of texts that consist of multiple arguments, i.e., arguments that both support and refute a given claim. <p> An exception to this, is Anscombre and Ducrot's approach [1], which depicts a semantic theory in which some words carry besides the usual semantic meaning, an argumentative connotation that orients the argumentative interpretation and the continuation of a discourse independently of the informative content it may carry. Elhadad <ref> [7] </ref> relies heavily on Ansombre and Ducrot's theory in building an NLG system that integrates both the conceptual and linguistic facets of argumentation, but his approach does not seem to be able to account for all the linguistic and conceptual features that were shown to characterize persuasive texts. 4 Conclusion In
