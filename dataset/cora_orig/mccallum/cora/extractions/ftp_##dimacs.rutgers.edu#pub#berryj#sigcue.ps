Title: Improving Discrete Mathematics and Algorithms Curricula with LINK  
Author: Jonathan Berry 
Address: College.  
Affiliation: Elon  
Abstract: This paper introduces the LINK system as an educational tool which can be used to visualize and experiment with discrete algorithms. An extended example demonstrates the flexibility of the system in the context of a fundamental graph algorithm: finding the strongly connected components of a directed graph.

For various reasons, none of these systems has the potential to be a widely-useful environment for both graph manipulation and computation.

Reference-contexts: The current system is described in the manual available from the web site, and the latter also contains links to a preview paper and a paper concerning LINK and market basket analysis. The early development of LINK is detailed in <ref> [2] </ref>. There is still much more work to be done to make LINK a widely useful tool. The algorithms library lacks numerous fundamental components, and there are no course materials designed to make use of LINK.

Reference-contexts: Consider the algorithm in Figure 2, which finds the strongly connected components 1 of a directed graph G = (V; E) given in Corman, Leiserson, & Rivest's well-known Introduction to Algorithms (CLR) <ref> [3] </ref>. (define (random-walk graph-view) (do ((v (random-vertex (graph graph-view)) (random-neighbor v))) ((not v) (reset-graphics graph-view)) (flash (vertex-item v graph-view)))) As Corman, Leiserson, and Rivest state, this remarkable algorithm seems to have nothing to do with strongly connected components (let us simply call them components).

Reference-contexts: A study of the experiences of secondary school teachers using Netpad and Combinatorica especially pointed out the need for flexibility and extensibility in educational applications <ref> [4] </ref>. Currently, LINK runs only on Unix systems (including Linux), but there is no major obstacle preventing a port to Windows, since the STk graphics system has already been ported. LINK for Windows might become a reality before the end of 1997.

Reference-contexts: More advanced computer science students will be able to use LINK's object-oriented libraries to program their own algorithms, animations, and experiments. LINK provides class libraries similar in spirit to the LEDA <ref> [6] </ref> class libraries, but more focused on discrete mathematical objects such as graphs and hypergraphs.

Reference-contexts: A lack of consensus on the part of discrete mathematics researchers regarding the ideal nature of such a system and a lack of entrepreneurial support to assume the burden of quality software development have contributed to this shortcoming.
