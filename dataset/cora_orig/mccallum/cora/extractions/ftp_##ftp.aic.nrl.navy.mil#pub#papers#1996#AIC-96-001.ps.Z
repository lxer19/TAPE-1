Abstract: Feedback plays an important role in human-computer interaction. It provides the user with evidence of closure, thus satisfying the communication expectations that users have when engaging in a dialogue. In this paper we present a model identifying five feedback states that must be communicated to the user to fulfill the communication expectations of a dialogue. The model is based on a linguistics theory of conversation, but is applied to a graphical user interface. An experiment is described in which we test users expectations and their behavior when those expectations are not met. The model subsumes some of the temporal requirements for feedback previously reported in the human-computer inter action literature.

Reference-contexts: BACKGROUND Feedback, in most of the human-computer interaction literature, refers to communication from the system to the user as a direct result of a users action [24]. Most user interface design guidelines also stress the importance of this type of feedback, for example <ref> [1] </ref> recommends keep the user informed and use feedback to confirm that the operation is being carried out, and (eventually) that its finished. Gaines [10] states that the response to a users action should be sufficient to identify the type of activity taking place. <p> Gaines [10] states that the response to a users action should be sufficient to identify the type of activity taking place. However, feedback also can be used to communicate the state of the system independently of the users action <ref> [1] </ref>. The system, at times, can be busy processing incoming events like mail messages, or alarm notifications that the user has preset days in advance. <p> Based on the states of understanding principles and on graphical user interface design guidelines, such as <ref> [1] </ref>, we have identified a number of feedback states needed in a human-computer dialogue to meet the humans communication expectations. Our model contains five simulated states of understanding (SSOU): ready processing reporting busy-no-response and busy-delayed-response .

Reference-contexts: They could be interpreting both states as busy-no response . Further data would be needed to fully explain this result. CONCLUSIONS We have taken a model of human conversation and reformulated some of the principles to cover human-computer interaction feedback. This is similar to the approach described in <ref> [2, 9, 17, 19] </ref>. Here, a theory of collaborative conversations served as the basis for the definition of states of feedback, with each representing different communication expectations users have when interacting with a computer.

Reference-contexts: This theory of contributions to conversations has already been applied in the study of human-computer dialogues. Payne [19, 20] analyzed the interaction in MacDraw based on presentation/acceptance trees. Brennan and Hulteen have defined a model of adaptive speech feedback <ref> [3] </ref> based on the states of understanding principles. A similar model is used in Apple Computers speech input system [15], Plain-Talk. The different states of feedback are identified with icons, as shown below. <p> This progress bar indi cates the amount of work being done inside of either the processing reporting state, as in the Macintosh file copying example. A closely related model, Brennan and Hulteens speech feedback model <ref> [3] </ref> differs from our models structure only in that their model does not account for our busy-delayed response state, possibly because it is not a common state in a speech understanding system.

Reference-contexts: Each participant was assigned randomly to one of three groups. Each group was presented with the three different treatments, counter-balanced according to a latin square design <ref> [4] </ref>. All participants received written instructions explaining the task to be performed.

Reference-contexts: The different states of feedback are identified with icons, as shown below. States of Understanding States of understanding (SOU) are the states that a listener believes he or she is in, after receiving a presentation from the speaker <ref> [6] </ref>. SOU is one of many ways participants in conversations fulfill their goals in the collaborative process. The listener provides evidence of his or her SOU thus allowing the speaker to adapt according to the specific SOU. The states are defined as follows.
Reference: 7. <author> Clark, H.H. and Wilkes-Gibbs, D. </author> <title> Referring as a collaborative process. </title> <journal> Cognition, </journal> <volume> 11, </volume>
Reference-contexts: For example, if after presenting a question, the speaker receives evidence that the listener is in state 1, the speaker might repeat or rephrase the question to help the listener reach state 3. The two partners follow the principle of least collaborative effort <ref> [7] </ref>. This principle states that speaker and hearer will try to minimize the collaborative effort it takes to reach a level of under standing. If a SOU is not clearly communicated by the listener, the speaker will seek further evidence that the sleeping listening hearing working communication was received.

Reference-contexts: In these cases, the system must let the user know its current state of processing so that the user does not feel frustrated or locked out of the dialogue. Foley and van Dam <ref> [8] </ref> describe feedback in terms of interpersonal conversations, such as responses to questions or signs of attentiveness. Both of these conversational devices are classified as forms of feedback. What is common in all of these views of feedback is that it serves a behavioral purpose in interaction.

Reference-contexts: This state has been called type-ahead in command line interfaces. It is important that the busy states be signalled to the user to maintain a sense of presence [17] of the interface. It has been recommended that some form of placebo <ref> [9] </ref> is pro vided to ensure the user the system has not crashed. In our model we have subclassified the busy states into two sepa rate states because of the different behavioral role each fulfills in the dialogue. <p> They could be interpreting both states as busy-no response . Further data would be needed to fully explain this result.

This is similar to the approach described in <ref> [2, 9, 17, 19] </ref>.

Because most actions are short there is little need for feed back in the processing state. Most response time studies <ref> [10, 11, 16, 17] </ref> are also related to this internal loop. Depending on the complexity of the action requested by the user, the time requirements for the response vary. If the user moves the mouse, he or she would expect the cursor on the screen to be moved accordingly.

Reference-contexts: The other two states are collectively known as the busy states and represent feedback as an indicator of system state. The notation used on Figure 2 is a modification of that presented in <ref> [12] </ref>. The internal loop has a history component. When a transition is made to one of the busy states, the internal loop remembers the state in which it was. When the transition is made back into the loop, it returns to the state remembered.

Reference-contexts: hear a short uh hum or see a nod of the head, you might think that the other person did not understand and as a result you might interrupt the conversation while you question the listeners attentiveness; hey, are you awake? This idea of communication expectations, also called psychological closure <ref> [16, 25] </ref>, is a common human behavioral characteristic that also exists when we are interacting with a computer. <p> User actions in the ready state require short and quick responses from the system in the form of the reporting state.

Reference-contexts: For example, if the user types a command but receives no response from the user interface, the user might repeatedly press the return key to make sure that the system has heard (or received) the command. At times it is not even clear who is waiting for whom <ref> [17] </ref>. Many studies of feedback have been reported in the literature. Some deal with response times guidelines for feedback, others have addressed performance penalties caused by delayed responses [26], while others deal with the form feedback should take. <p> The model represents the communication expectations from a users point of view. It does not address the communication expectations that the computer could or should have in a human-computer dialogue, see <ref> [17] </ref> for a discussion of this issue. A user interface is a collection of concurrent dialogues between the user and the computing system . For each one 1.In this context, system refers to the user interface component of the software system. <p> In the other busy state, busy delayed -response , all user initiated actions are saved and processed later. This state has been called type-ahead in command line interfaces. It is important that the busy states be signalled to the user to maintain a sense of presence <ref> [17] </ref> of the interface. It has been recommended that some form of placebo [9] is pro vided to ensure the user the system has not crashed. <p> User actions in the ready state require short and quick responses from the system in the form of the reporting state.

Reference-contexts: If the user moves the mouse, he or she would expect the cursor on the screen to be moved accordingly. Such short actions, sometimes called reex actions, require a response of less than 0.1 seconds <ref> [18] </ref>. In these cases, this is the timing constraint for a complete pass through the internal loop of the model. For more complex actions, for example actions that take more than 10 seconds, a progress bar should be displayed.
