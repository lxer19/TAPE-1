Reference-contexts: EXAMPLE 2. There exists a nonassociative function that is associative relative to any nondecreasing sequence of records. The maximal plateau problem <ref> [Gri81] </ref> asks for the length of the longest plateau in a nondecreasing sequence u of integers, where a plateau is a slice of the sequence all of whose values are equal. The maximal plateau problem can be solved using a general reduction operator as follows. <p> relative associativity of f appears in Section 4.1.2 The function in Example 2 is also associative relative to the sequence naturally corresponding to any nonincreasing sequence and, more generally, any sequence in which each subsequence consisting of equal component values is a slice. (This is consistent with an observation in <ref> [Gri81] </ref> concerning a program to solve the maximal plateau problem.) Other applications of using general reduction operators that, like Example 2, involve the use of records to collect information are discussed in [Cha90].

Reference-contexts: Such a general reduction operator is provided in several languages for parallel computing, such as iPSC/2 Fortran and C [Int89] and the innovative and less conventional languages Connection Machine Lisp <ref> [HS86] </ref> and Paralation Lisp [Sab88]. Since R need apply f only to the sequence s, it is not necessary that f be associative, only that f satisfy an associativity property relative to the sequence s. The concept of associativity relative to a sequence is defined and studied in this paper.

Reference-contexts: Given that a function f is known to be associative, a general reduction operator R obtains the reduction R (f; s) of a finite sequence s using the function f. Such a general reduction operator is provided in several languages for parallel computing, such as iPSC/2 Fortran and C <ref> [Int89] </ref> and the innovative and less conventional languages Connection Machine Lisp [HS86] and Paralation Lisp [Sab88]. Since R need apply f only to the sequence s, it is not necessary that f be associative, only that f satisfy an associativity property relative to the sequence s.

Reference-contexts: The main results of this paper are characterization theorems for associativity and relative associativity, which provide an alternative approach to proving associativity that requires the consideration of no more than p cases. 1 Language support for reductions was provided much earlier by APL <ref> [Ive62] </ref>. 1 2 ASSOCIATIVITY RELATIVE TO A SEQUENCE Before presenting a mathematical characterization of associativity it is necessary to provide preliminary definitions and results related to associativity and reductions.
