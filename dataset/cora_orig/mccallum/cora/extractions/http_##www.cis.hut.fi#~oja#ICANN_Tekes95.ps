Abstract: Tekes (Technology Development Centre), a financing organization under the Finnish ministry of trade and industry, has launched a four-year technology programme "Applications of learning and intelligent systems". The programme consists of several research projects, mainly headed by universities, as well as enterprise projects, headed by companies. The key application technologies are neural networks and fuzzy systems, and the largest application areas are industrial control, monitoring, diagnostics, and finance. Presently, the annual budget is about 30 million mk, equivalent to 5 million Ecu. The number of participating companies is

Reference-contexts: Teuvo Kohonen of Helsinki University of Technology 1 which started in late 60's. This work has concentrated on associative memo-ries, artificial neural networks, unsupervised learning, and pattern recognition. Perhaps the best known result is the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), which was recently covered thoroughly in the text-book <ref> [1] </ref>. The number of references to that single network is in the thousands. The research is world-class and gives a unique opportunity to follow the international developments in the field. <p> At the time of this writing <ref> (March 1995) </ref>, there are 5 research projects going on, coordinated by universities and the Technical Research Centre (VTT). These are more research oriented than the rest of the programme, and the percentage of public funding from TEKES is about 80 percent.

Reference-contexts: The scope, participants, contents, and basic structure of the programme were planned, and a report <ref> [2] </ref> was compiled on the application possibilities of neural networks in Finland. From September 1994 to February 1995, several projects were carried out, largely as feasibility studies to better focus on the most relevant applications and methods.

Reference-contexts: number of universities and research institutes about 15. 2.3 Examples Taipale Engineering and Carelcomp, together with the Lappeenranta university of technology, have developed a simulation and optimization system for the quality properties in a paper machine, based on a multi-layer perceptron network that associates process measurements with output quality factors <ref> [3] </ref>. The system is now operational in a paper mill. The same principle is applied to a number of similar processes which are hard to model and for which measurement data are available.

Reference-contexts: The same principle is applied to a number of similar processes which are hard to model and for which measurement data are available. Golemtech and Wisaforest, together with Oulu university, have developed a fuzzy control system for a lime reburning kiln <ref> [4] </ref>. Fuzzy control is efficient because process variations are large and process delays are long. The economical effects of this application have been remarkable. Infomarket, together with Lappeenranta university of technology, has developed a customer profiling system for supermarkets that is based on the Kohonen map.
