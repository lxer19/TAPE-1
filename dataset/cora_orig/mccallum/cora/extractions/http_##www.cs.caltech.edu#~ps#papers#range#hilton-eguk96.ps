Title: Building 3D Graphical Models of Complex Objects  
Author: A. Hilton, A.J.Stoddart, J. Illingworth and T.Windeatt 
Abstract: A system is presented for the automated reconstruction of complete 3D models of arbitrarily shaped objects from multiple 2.5D range images. The system enables reliable reconstruction of 3D models of complex objects. This is achieved without a priori knowledge about the object to be modelled. Potential application domains include reverse engineering of 3D models for graphics and CAD. Geometric fusion is achieved by integration of multiple range images into a single 3D implicit surface representation. The implicit surface provides a framework for integrating redundant overlapping measurements based on the local surface geometry. This ensures accurate representation of the measured surface geometry and topology for complex objects. Triangulated 3D models are then reconstructed using an implicit surface polygonisation algorithm. `Marching Cubes' provides a standard algorithm for implicit surface polygonisation. However, this algorithm results in an inefficient model and requires all measurements to be made prior to model construction. These limitations are addressed by the introduction of a new implicit surface polygonisation algorithm called `Marching Triangles'. The new algorithm is based on a local 3D constraint which ensures the resulting model is a 3D Delaunay surface triangulation. Marching Triangles constructs an efficient representation and enables dynamic integration of new measurements. Results are demonstrated of reliable 3D model reconstruction for complex objects.

Reference-contexts: This defines the local surface continuity for each range image. For a single mesh M the field function, f (~x), is constructed as the signed distance to the nearest mesh point, ~p (x; y; z). A binary function, b (~x) = <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, is used to explicitly label field function values, f (~x), with nearest points on the mesh boundary. <p> Marching Cubes is a standard algorithm for polygonisation of closed manifold implicit surfaces, <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. A simple extension to this algorithm enables the polygonisation of implicit surfaces with holes, [8, 7]. However, marching cubes has several limitations: * The algorithm is inherently static requiring all data a priori. * Polygonisation is computationally expensive. * Inefficient representation due to the non-uniform triangle shape.

Reference-contexts: Turk et al. [14] integrated range image triangulations using a dynamic mesh `zippering' approach. Overlapping regions of meshes are eroded and the boundary correspondence found by operations in 3D space. A local 2D constrained triangulation is then used to join overlapping mesh boundaries to form a single mesh. Boissonnat <ref> [3] </ref> and Rutishauser et al. [11] retriangulate overlapping meshes using local 2D constraints on triangle shape. The four integration algorithms are completely different in their approach to constructing a single triangulated model. This results in different complexity, limitations and failure modes. <p> Such that there exists a sphere which passes through each vertex, x, of T which does not contain any other interior points of X. In the case where the points, X, lie on a manifold surface, S, Boissonnat <ref> [3] </ref> derives the following important property. <p> A local 3D Delaunay manifold surface is guaranteed provided the triangle, T , satisfies the condition that no part of the existing model is inside an arbitrary sphere passing through the three triangle vertices, <ref> [3] </ref>. Defining the sphere about the equi-distant point in the element plane enables this constraint to be satisfied. If different surface regions are in close proximity the sphere about the center, c T , may intersect another surface region but still give a valid local triangulation. <p> Step (vi) allows the local connection of existing model nodes to form a continuous surface representation. Marching triangles does not impose any constraint on the position of new vertices. In particular mesh vertices are not constrained to lie at measurement points unlike previous mesh growing procedures <ref> [3, 11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Hence, building a model using this constraint guarantees that the local surface does not over-fold or self-intersect. In addition by imposing a constraint that ensures the surface is locally Delaunay we ensure that the resulting triangulated model, M , is globally Delaunay, Fortune <ref> [4] </ref>. The circumcenter in the triangle plane, c T , is taken as the fourth point required to define a sphere for each triangular element.

Reference-contexts: Static integration of m range images requires O (m) nearest point evaluations for each implicit surface function evaluation, f (x). Assuming the model is triangulated at approximately the same spatial resolution as the original measurements and using the Euler formula <ref> [9] </ref> the number of implicit surface function evaluations is O (mN ). Hence, the time complexity of the static Marching Triangles integration algorithm is O (m 2 N ). Dynamic integration of a single range image requires the evaluation of the implicit surface for a single mesh.
