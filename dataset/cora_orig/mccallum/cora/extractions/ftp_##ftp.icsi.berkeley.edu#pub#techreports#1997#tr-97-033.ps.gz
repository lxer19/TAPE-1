Title: Social Carrier Recommendation for Selecting Services in Electronic Telecommunication Markets A Preliminary  
Date: August 1997  
Pubnum: Report ICSI TR 97-033  
Abstract: The proliferation of telecommunication services and the need to manage quality of service on an end-to-end basis require an approach for automatically selecting services that provide sufficient quality of service at minimal cost. An agent-based approach is appropriate for such a purpose. For this reason, this paper presents a social carrier recommendation method, which is an essential component of application-level end-to-end quality of service management as well as a way to make the final step towards electronic telecommunication markets. For electronic telecommunication markets, the proposed approach provides a consumer-based evaluation of services as well as "rational" user agents that select services and carriers based on needs, offered prices, and ratings. Therefore, this approach complements existing market mechanisms that either provide means to buy services or intend to improve sales and customer service of carriers.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, it is necessary to enable the user to specify his needs in particular situations. These requirements have to be mapped into network service QoS requirements <ref> [AS96] </ref>. Since the routes of information flows have to be determined, the selection of a service provider is of particular interest in this paper. For this purpose, source routing is required to enforce the choice. <p> These expectations depend on the time of day: a user might demand shorter file transfer times at the end of his working days. User profiles are constructed from observing the user and the user's requirements communicated to the application (see, for instance, <ref> [AS96] </ref>). The SCR User Agent is an application-level QoS manager, because the user agent carries out the following steps for each communication: 1. <p> As pointed out in [SM95], the parameter N determines how much a user values past experience. In other words, a large N characterizes loyal customers. Note that techniques for measuring delivered QoS exist <ref> [AS96] </ref> and, hence, they are not further discussed in this paper.

Reference-contexts: Such markets require also agents on the service provider side: Realizing services by means of mobile agents within end-terminals enables service subscription for single usages [Mag96], which is very attractive for an electronic telecommunication market. In <ref> [WBT95, Bus96] </ref>, a customer is connected in the network of a provider to a customer agent that negotiates the service requests of the customers and pro-actively offers services to the customers. Before offering pro-actively services, a customer agent determines whether, for instance, the current price is attractive for a customer. <p> Before offering pro-actively services, a customer agent determines whether, for instance, the current price is attractive for a customer. Especially, this will become important if pricing is dynamic and based on current load, as it is the case in <ref> [WBT95, Bus96] </ref>. Such customer agents improve the service offered to the customer by a single service provider.

Reference-contexts: For this purpose, source routing is required to enforce the choice. IPv6 [DEF + 95], for instance, provides the necessary support, which is also required for QoS routing. Source routing for provider selection is different from policy routing <ref> [Cla89] </ref>, which enables network providers to route traffic based on policies. Nevertheless, many issues are the same for both approaches.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, service providers could also benefit from SCR by taking the rating (i.e., a customer feedback) into account for adapting their service offers. For measuring the performance of web-sites, Net.Genesis and net.Sweep offer performance analysis by monitoring web-sites from distributed polling stations <ref> [CW996] </ref>. Besides, the SCR can be used as a tool to check whether a network is over-booked. Over-booking is a technique to increase the network utilization. Customer agents which negotiate with the customer in the carriers system facilitate to determine appropriate levels of over-booking. SCR prevents excessive over-booking.

Reference-contexts: A user is assisted in SCR by a so-called User Agent that selects services according to the directives and observed preferences of the user. The presentation of SCR focuses on the selection process since agents acting as buyers in electronic markets exist already <ref> [KH96] </ref>. This leads in a natural way to electronic telecommunication markets in which telecommunication services are offered, traded, and bought electronically by agents. <p> The SCR provides assistance to a user for selecting appropriate services and 3 carriers (or service providers) for the applications the user utilizes. 1 This Section focuses on the selection process, because agents acting as buyers on behalf of users exist already <ref> [KH96] </ref>. 2.1 The SCR User Agent and its QoS Manager Function A SCR User Agent keeps track of * the user's expectations (i.e., user-level QoS), which are recorded in a User Profile, * the applications used and their requirements, (Application Profile) and * service agreements and the measured delivered QoS.

Reference-contexts: These applications pose very different requirements on telecommunication services. For instance, researchers employ the Internet to locate and disseminate information, whereas residential users might be mostly interested in communication between people <ref> [KSM + 96] </ref>. The most successful telecommunication services are the ones that meet best the requirements of their target market, which results in a proliferation of services.

In [WBT95, Bus96], a customer is connected in the network of a provider to a customer agent that negotiates the service requests of the customers and pro-actively offers services to the customers. <p> However, there are mobile telephony services without subscription, because each call is payed using electronic cash (stored on a smart card). More single usage subscription services might be offered in the future based on mobile agents <ref> [Mag96] </ref>. In addition, multiple services might also be bundled to service packages, which are offered on a subscription base. For instance, Internet Service Providers often offer not only Internet access but also an e-mail account, web-page hosting, and so on.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, many issues are the same for both approaches. The implementation of source routing for service provider selection is not further discussed in this paper. 2 Social Carrier Recommendation The basic idea of SCR is to adapt social information filtering techniques <ref> [SM95] </ref> for recommending services, i.e., enable users with similar applications and with similar communication needs to recommend services and service providers, respectively. <p> The delivered QoS is determined to rate each single flow. The rating of a single flow is aggregated to a user flow rating (UFR) which is based on the previous N assessments. As pointed out in <ref> [SM95] </ref>, the parameter N determines how much a user values past experience. In other words, a large N characterizes loyal customers. Note that techniques for measuring delivered QoS exist [AS96] and, hence, they are not further discussed in this paper. <p> The local network carrier rating is obtained by combining the ratings of all flows between locations within the local network. This combined rating is called community carrier rating (CCR). CCR takes the similarities of the users (i.e., their profiles) into account by employing social information filtering techniques <ref> [SM95] </ref>. Long-distance carrier rating (LDCR) is more difficult, because no traffic is originating or terminating within a long-distance network (LDs). The schema proposed here is applicable to flow routes over multiple long-distance networks. That means that this paper considers flows of the form LN-(LD) i -LN.

Reference-contexts: The schema proposed here is applicable to flow routes over multiple long-distance networks. That means that this paper considers flows of the form LN-(LD) i -LN. Different QoS parameters have to be accumulated differently <ref> [WC96] </ref>. Consequently, a QoS rating approach has to operate on a vector and to apply the appropriate operations. For instance, the rating of a flow is the sum of the rating of the local carrier networks and the rating of the long-distance network.
