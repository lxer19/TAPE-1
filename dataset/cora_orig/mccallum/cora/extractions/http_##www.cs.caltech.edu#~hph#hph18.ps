Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this note I will present an unpublished broadcasting algorithm first found by A.J. Martin. The presentation will first follow R.-J.R. Back's method <ref> [1] </ref> to construct an action system that solves the problem. Next a CSP-like program is given and proven directly. Finally the relation between the two is explored. 2 Statement of the problem We quote from [1] Let (V ; E ) be a [connected] graph with V a finite set of <p> Martin.

Let the nodes denote processes and the edges denote communication channels between the processes. <p> We are required to design [.. a program] that assigns (broadcasts) the value v :0 to each variable v :i , i *V nf0g. The termination of the broadcast must be detected by node 0, after which this node initiates some other computation R. The specification in <ref> [1] </ref> requires in addition that node 0 knows the identities of all the nodes in the network, but this leads to 1 H.Peter Hofstee is supported by an IBM graduate fellowship. ii HPH 18 an algorithm that does not scale to large numbers of nodes. <p> This solution has been coined the 'gossip algorithm' by A. J. Martin. 3 Action system An initial nondistributed solution to the problem is given in begin v :i := v :0 for i *V nf0g; end FIGURE 1. An equivalent action system <ref> [1] </ref> is given in Figure 2. We next transform the action system in order to decentralize the actions [A:i ]. For each node we introduce a queue variable.
