Reference-contexts: In the remainder of this section, we will consider the use of our extension facility to treat four separate semantic extensions: definitions, probabilities, procedural attachments and relevance logic <ref> [1] </ref>. We have attached mlg to the extension names in order to indicate that they are mere trial balloons that might be supported by only a single researcher. <p> Or, we might have :attach-mlg lisp! :label a002 indicating that any lisp predicate without side effects is procedurally attached in this way. Once again, other examples are similar. If we intend that the database be interpreted using Belnap's four-valued relevance logic <ref> [1] </ref> instead of conventional methods, we might write :relevance-ndb nil :label b001 A modal operator of knowledge with an S5 semantics might lead us to write :modal-sak (L S5) :label s001 while if L is described truth-functionally instead, we would have :modal-mlg (L lisp-fn) :label g001 where lisp-fn is the function

Reference-contexts: is aware of this and has discouraged any analogy between the development of kif and the development of a language such as Common Lisp. 1 The interlingua group is attempting to address this difficulty by creating a single language in which all of the knowledge representation schemes can be expressed <ref> [2] </ref>, but this seems impossible given the current state of the field. <p> Again, since the intent of the kif is to allow users of one language (and the associated inference mechanism) access to the knowledge encoded by others, this problem needs to be addressed. Some of these extensions are treated in <ref> [2] </ref> and some are not. The point, however, is that the treatments that do exist are and inevitably will be hopelessly idiosyncratic. The presentation in [2] deals with nonmonotonic reasoning using ideas that are less than a year old and deals with quotation using techniques that have never even appeared in <p> Some of these extensions are treated in <ref> [2] </ref> and some are not. The point, however, is that the treatments that do exist are and inevitably will be hopelessly idiosyncratic. The presentation in [2] deals with nonmonotonic reasoning using ideas that are less than a year old and deals with quotation using techniques that have never even appeared in the literature. I am not saying that these ideas are without merit, only that their inclusion in a standard is obviously premature. <p> We will return to this issue in Section 5, where we discuss the question of whether the development of a kif is a research or standardization venture. In the meantime, our own approach to the idiosyncracies of <ref> [2] </ref> will be to describe a language that refuses to commit on any topic that is the focus of current KR research. <p> But will it work? Is it reasonable to expect it to be possible to transmit useful knowledge from one group to another using our interlingua or any other, or are there simply too many special-purpose idiosyncrasies to which any practical system is committed? The developers of the hypothetical kif standard <ref> [2] </ref> have proposed answering this questioning by using their standard to translate a declarative knowledge base from one special-purpose language to another. <p> The work should be reported as research, and funded and evaluated as research as well. In this vein, I would like to applaud the tone taken in [4], where it is made clear that research is being pursued and that standards are not. I am far less sympathetic with <ref> [2] </ref>, which claims on no fewer than seventeen occasions that a standard is being developed. <p> But the development of a wide-ranging kif such as that pursued in <ref> [2] </ref> has very little to do with this question! If neither of the groups trying to exchange knowledge use nonmonotonic reasoning, including it in a kif is completely immaterial to the question of whether these groups can share knowledge effectively. <p> This, then, is the fundamental difference between the ideas presented in this paper and those presented in <ref> [2] </ref>. By proposing a minimalistic language and describing specific experiments, I am trying to further a research investigation of the practicality of knowledge 10 sharing. By proposing the adoption by fiat of a specific maximalistic language, [2] is clearly in the business of forming a standard. <p> the fundamental difference between the ideas presented in this paper and those presented in <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Although this makes unification more difficult than it typically is, it is possible to construct a unifier that handles this more general problem and only incurs significant computational overhead when attempting to unify expressions that actually do contain multiple sequence variables. This unifier is described in <ref> [3] </ref> and is available via anonymous ftp from t.stanford.edu. Any variable whose second character is * is a sequence variable; all other variables are not. Thus ?* and ?*x are examples of sequence variables; ? and ?x are nonsequence variables.
