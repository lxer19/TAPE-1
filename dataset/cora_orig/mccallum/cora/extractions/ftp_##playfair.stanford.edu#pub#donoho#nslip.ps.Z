Abstract: We describe the Wavelet-Vaguelette Decomposition (WVD) of a linear inverse problem. It is a substitute for the singular value decomposition (SVD) of an inverse problem, and it exists for a class of special inverse problems of homogeneous type such as numerical differentiation, inversion of Abel-type transforms, certain convolution transforms, and the Radon Transform. We propose to solve ill-posed linear inverse problems by nonlinearly "shrinking" the WVD coefficients of the noisy, indirect data. Our approach offers significant advantages over traditional SVD inversion in the case of recovering spatially inhomogeneous objects. We suppose that observations are contaminated by white noise and that the object is an unknown element of a Besov space. We prove that nonlinear WVD shrinkage can be tuned to attain the minimax rate of convergence, for L 2 loss, over the entire Besov scale. The important case of Besov spaces B p;q , p &lt; 2, which model spatial inhomogeneity, is included. In comparison, linear procedures - SVD included cannot attain optimal rates of convergence over such classes in the case p &lt; 2. For example, our methods achieve faster rates of convergence, for objects known to lie in the Bump

These scales include all the Holder, Lipschitz, and Sobolev classes, and many other interesting function spaces as well. Other interesting spaces, such as Bounded Variation, are tightly bracketed between two members of this scale. <p> Other interesting spaces, such as Bounded Variation, are tightly bracketed between two members of this scale. The basic result: if the mother wavelet is a little smoother than typical members of one of these function spaces, then the wavelets provide an unconditional basis <ref> [36, 25] </ref>, i.e. if (ff ) are the wavelet coefficients of an object in the space, then ( ff ) are wavelet coefficients of another object in the space, for every sequence of signs ( ). <p> We can check that f 2 B p;q , the Besov space, by seeing if the norm P P 1=q where s = + 1=2 1=p <ref> [33, 23, 25, 36] </ref>. A coordinatewise test in the wavelet domain reveals membership in this smoothness class. 6 As a simple example, we consider the Bump Algebra for the real line, defined as follows. (See Meyer's book [36]). <p> A coordinatewise test in the wavelet domain reveals membership in this smoothness class. 6 As a simple example, we consider the Bump Algebra for the real line, defined as follows.

In usual treatments of wavelets <ref> [12, 35, 36] </ref>, one introduces, in tandem with the mother wavelet introduced above, a father wavelet .

Reference-contexts: In the Soviet literature of the 1980's, the white noise model has been extensively studied for its own sake, and several elegant and surprising results have been discovered <ref> [28, 41] </ref>. We study the white noise model because it arises as the large-sample limit of various "real" estimation problems, such as nonparametric regression, density estimation, and time series spectral estimation.

Reference-contexts: (1989), O'Sullivan (1986), and Wahba (1989). 1.1 The SVD Paradigm It is usual to treat such problems by devices such as quadratic regularization [Tikhonov, 1962, Phillips 1962, Twomey 1962]: for &gt; 0 one sets ^ f = (K fl K + I) 1 K fl y; by iterative damped backprojection <ref> [43] </ref> ^ f 0 = K fl y : : : where &gt; 0 is a damping parameter; and by Singular Value Decomposition methods, defined as follows. <p> Thus, if we pick w - = k 2 - k 2 - + , we get the method of regularization; and if we pick w - = (1 (1 k 2 - ) m ) we get the m-th iterative damped backprojection <ref> [3, 43] </ref>. The singular system approach has been thoroughly studied for applications in a variety of fields; when the singular functions turn out to be of simple functional forms this is particularly so. See Bertero, De Mol, and Pike (1985), and Johnstone and Silverman (1990, 1991) for examples.
