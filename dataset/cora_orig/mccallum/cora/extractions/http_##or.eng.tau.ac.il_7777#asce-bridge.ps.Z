Abstract: Bridge databases contain significant information that can assist in future bridge management decisions. The effective utilization of this information requires facilities for the flexible extraction of usable knowledge in the form practitioners can use. We propose machine learning technology as a means to perform this knowledge extraction and to support the maintenance of bridge database information. An integrated system is proposed for supporting practitioners in the practical use of this technology.

Reference-contexts: Such knowledge can subsequently be used in solving problems. Several research projects have explored the use of ML in civil engineering (Arciszewski and Rossman 1992) and other relevant disciplines for: (1) evaluating structures during preliminary design <ref> (Arciszewski et al 1987) </ref>; (2) learning from failures of structures (Stone and Blockley 1 Senior Lecturer, Department of Solid Mechanics, Materials and Structures, Faculty of Engineering, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.

Reference-contexts: First, information stored in bridge inventories is almost never used effectively. Second, bridge management systems are developed based on few fixed algorithms such as: (1) the level of service concept <ref> (Isa Al-Subhi et al 1989) </ref>; (2) statistical analysis for cost estimation (Saito and Sinha 1990); or (3) dynamic optimization (Jiang and Sinha 1989). Together, the ineffective and inflexible use of data can render any approach unsatisfactory.

Reference-contexts: Rather, n-dim uses a notion of conceptual information modeling that allows multiple classifications to be imposed over a corpus of information. Abstraction levels are imposed by the users, in whatever way they see fit. Observing the difficulties of diffusing information systems into departments of transportation <ref> (Lane and Hartgen 1990) </ref>, in particular, and similar difficulties in other disciplines, we anticipate that the use of n-dim as an infrastruc 6 Of course, any algorithm mentioned before for manipulating BMSs' data can be incorporated in such models. 7 n-dim is developed by a group that includes (in alphabetical order):

Reference-contexts: Since the information in bridge databases evolves continually, the learning technique must be incremental.

Reference-contexts: facilitate flexible modeling in diverse disciplines (Levy et al 1993; Subrahmanian et al 1993). 7 n-dim's underlying philosophy is based on numerous observational studies of engineers conducting design activities, a theory about shared memory in design (Konda et al 1992; Monarch et al 1993), and a theory about participatory design <ref> (Reich et al 1992) </ref>. The third generation of n-dim is currently being built in an evolutionary prototyping mode. n-dim does not impose any single representation or abstraction technique on the modeling activities of engineers. Such restrictions may render a sound and promising technique unusable, thus leading to its practical failure.

Reference-contexts: We intend to develop a technique that creates such rules. A system that learns from BMSs must provide facilities for handling a range of issues in applying ML programs to data <ref> (Reich et al 1993) </ref>. In addition, since different agencies or users would need, to accommodate their own knowledge, bridge management policies or preferences in the learning process, the learning technique must allow for the use of background knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Part of the constraints on the structure will be imposed through the desire to use ML techniques on the data but, in addition, the ML techniques can assist in detecting data dependencies and enforcing integrity constraints <ref> (Schlimmer 1993) </ref>. Thus, we see ML techniques as interacting closely with the practice of bridge management and the evolution of the bridge database schema. In this view, ML techniques not only extract knowledge from bridge databases but also support the maintenance of and addition of data to bridge databases.
