Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The traffic management specification TM4.0 developed by the ATM Forum is a great technological development <ref> [1, 5] </ref>. From May 1993 to April 1996, it took approximately 3 years to develop the specification. Each bimonthly meeting of the working group was attended by over 150 persons. <p> This section discusses each rule and traces the development and implications of certain important rules. In some cases the precise statement of the rule is important. Hence, the source and destination rules are quoted from the TM specification <ref> [1] </ref> in appendix 9. A list of abbreviations and their expansions is provided in appendix 9. * Source Rule 1: Sources should always transmit at a rate equal to or below their computed ACR. The ACR cannot exceed PCR and need not go below MCR. <p> Vendors are free to implement additional proprietary restraints at the source or at the switch. A few examples of such possibilities are listed in the Informative Appendix I.8 of the specification <ref> [1] </ref>. See also [4], [2], [11]. * Source Rule 6: If a network link becomes broken or becomes highly congested, the RM cells may get blocked in a queue and the source may not receive the feedback. <p> In such cases destination rules 3 and 4 specify that old out-of-date information can be discarded. The destinations are allowed a number of options to do this. The implications of various options of destination Rule 3 are discussed in the Informative Appendix I.7 of the TM specification <ref> [1] </ref>. Briefly, the recommendations attempt to ensure the flow of feedback to the sources for a wide range of values of ACR of the reverse direction VC. If the reverse direction ACR is non-zero, then a backward RM cell will be scheduled for in-rate transmission.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The traffic management specification TM4.0 developed by the ATM Forum is a great technological development <ref> [1, 5] </ref>. From May 1993 to April 1996, it took approximately 3 years to develop the specification. Each bimonthly meeting of the working group was attended by over 150 persons. <p> The frequency of FRM is determined by parameters Nrm, Trm, and Mrm, whose default values are 32, 100 ms, and 2, respectively. During the debate on credit vs rate based alternatives for traffic management <ref> [5] </ref>, the rate based group selected a default value of 32 for Nrm. This ensured that the control overhead was equivalent to that of credit based alternative which claimed an overhead of approximately 6%. During normal operation 1/32th or 3% of all cells are FRM cells.

Reference-contexts: The decrease is determined by rate decrease factor (RDF) parameter. Unlike the increase, which is additive, the decrease is multiplicative in the sense that ACR ACR (1 Nrm=RDF) It has been shown that additive increase and multiplicative decrease is sufficient to achieve fairness <ref> [6] </ref>. Other combinations such as additive increase with additive decrease, multiplicative increase with multiplicative decrease, and multiplicative increase with additive increase are unfair. The no-increase (NI) bit was introduced to handle mild congestion cases.

Reference-contexts: The only reliable way to protect a switch from large queues is to build it in the switch allocation algorithm. The ERICA+ algorithm <ref> [7] </ref> is an example of one such algorithm. Observe that the FRTT parameter which is the sum of fixed delays on the path is used in the formula for ICR.

Reference-contexts: However, if the earlier ACR was very low, it is possible that the very next cell is scheduled a long time in the future. In such a situation, it is advantageous to "reschedule" the next cell, so that the source can take advantage of the high ACR allocation immediately <ref> [8] </ref>. * Source Rule 10: Sources should initialize various fields of FRM cells as follows. For virtual path connections (VPCs), the virtual circuit id (VCI) is set to 6. For virtual channel connections (VCCs), the VCI of the connection is used.

Reference-contexts: We argued that RTT estimated at connection setup 10 is a random quantity bearing little relation to the round trip delays during actual operation <ref> [9] </ref>. Such parameter setting could trigger source Rule 6 unnecessarily and degrade performance. Hence, the Forum decided to use FRTT parameter instead of RTT.

Reference-contexts: It has been incorrectly believed that cell loss could be avoided by simply negotiating a TBE value below the number of available buffers in the switches. Jain et al. <ref> [10] </ref> showed that it is possible to construct workloads where queue sizes could be unreasonably high even when TBE is very small.

Reference-contexts: There are three ways for switches to give feedback to the sources. First, each cell header contains a bit called Explicit Forward Congestion Indication (EFCI), which can be set by a congested switch. This mechanism is a modification of the DECbit scheme <ref> [12] </ref>. Such switches are called "binary" or "EFCI" switches. Second, RM cells have two bits in their payload, called the Congestion Indication (CI) bit and the No Increase (NI) bit, that can be set by congested switches. Switches that use only this mechanism are called relative rate marking switches.
