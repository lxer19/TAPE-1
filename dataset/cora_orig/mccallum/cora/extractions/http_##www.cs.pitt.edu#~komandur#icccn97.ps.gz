Reference-contexts: When there are either senders or receivers inside the non-SPAM island, then we propose having a MultiCast Server (MCS) <ref> [1] </ref> instance for the island; the MCS simply appears as a sender/receiver to the SPAM border switch. There are two distinct cases: Sender (s) in the island: The MCS reassembles the cells received from the senders in the island into packets and forwards them to the border switch.

Reference-contexts: The choice of multi-cast tree affects almost all of the above metrics. Recent studies <ref> [11, 2, 5] </ref> suggest that shared trees are very scalable in terms of bandwidth consumption, network resources to maintain the state, join latency, membership management complexity and operating system overhead. The work in [11] shows better delay and traffic concentration properties for SSTs and is based on flat random topologies.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Several classes of multimedia applications involve data delivery from a sender to multiple destinations (multicast). Examples include applications such as virtual classroom, on-demand movie servers, distributed file systems and databases and the use of group communication in general <ref> [3] </ref>. In order to support these applications, the underlying network must support an efficient multicast mechanism [4]. Establishing a multicast tree spanning the participants has emerged as an efficient solution for multicast. The two basic approaches to multicast tree construction are sender-specific tree (SST) and shared tree (ST). <p> Any future integrated services network must provide efficient support for the general uses of multicast. An important role of multicast service in distributed systems is to provide group abstraction <ref> [3] </ref>. For example, in Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS)[2] the multi-cast service can relieve the application of dealing with group membership dynamics, and allows it to simply address the group as a single entity.
