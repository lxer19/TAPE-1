Abstract: This paper presents the operation of tangential dilation, which describes the touching of differentiable surfaces. It generalizes the classical dilation, but is invertible. It is shown that line segments are eigenfunctions of this dilation, and are parallel-transported, and that curvature is additive. We then present the slope transform which is a re-representation of morphology onto the morphological eigenfunctions. As such, the slope transform provides for tangential morphology the same analytical power as the Fourier transform provides for linear signal processing. Under the slope transform dilation becomes addition (just as under a Fourier transform, convolution becomes multiplication). We give a discrete slope transform suited for implementation, and discuss the relationships to the Legendre transform, Young-Fenchel conjugate, and A-transform. We exhibit a logarithmic correspondence of this tangential morphology to linear systems theory, and touch on the consequences for morphological data analysis of a scanning tunnelling microscope.

Reference-contexts: Van den Boomgaard proved that dilation is a parallel transport of slopes, and formulated the differential equations of mathematical morphology purely in terms of the slope <ref> [1] </ref>. Maragos' A-transform [11] (which appeared simultaneous with the 2 slope transform [4]) will turn out to be a special case of the slope transform, for convex functions. <p> We will include an occasional non-strictly convex or concave structuring function as the limit of such a function. (We believe these restrictions will be waived eventually; for now, the lack of some proper formalizations prevents us from 2 In the morphological literature, the slope theorem is first found in <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> The interval-valued differentation is needed for x u = 0. At that point the function jxj changes slope from 1 to 1, and the derivative at that point equals the interval <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. We thus get for the derivative: 2u + [1; 1] = 0, together with x = u. <p> The interval-valued differentation is needed for x u = 0. At that point the function jxj changes slope from 1 to 1, and the derivative at that point equals the interval <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. We thus get for the derivative: 2u + [1; 1] = 0, together with x = u. The result is therefore x 2 with x 2 [1=2; 1=2]. 2 2.5 How Morphology Changes Curvature We can use the tangential dilation to establish a result on second derivatives and radius of curvature. <p> The slope theorem is such a result, if cast in the form of `parallel normal transport' <ref> [1] </ref>. A result involving second order properties is the addition of radii of curvature. Let R f (x) be the radius of curvature of a function f at x. <p> So for x &gt; 0 : ! = 1 and for x &lt; 0 : ! = 1. At x = 0 the gradient is interval-valued and equal to <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. The result follows. 2 3.4 Properties of the Slope Transform Important properties of the slope transform are summarized in Fig. 6. Most are easily proved, for instance the property: af (x) ! aS [f ]( a So: multiplication in spatial domain becomes umbral scaling in the slope domain. <p> transformation of the figure gives Fig.8b, which may be compared to Fig.1b. * dilation by a cone: When we dilate a function by a cone, we limit the slopes of the result: f (x) jxj ! S [f ](!) + I (!) = S [f ](!) such that ! 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref> (46) Proof: Direct application of the dilation theorem and the dual of eq.(41). 2 We have seen an example of this in eq.(15). <p> At ! = 0, the gradient of the slope transform acquires an additive factor of rj!j = <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, i.e. it becomes interval-valued. <p> We have to choose some sensible approximation for the derivatives with respect to i. Let us take the simplest: _x (i) ! x i x i1 ; i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> (52) The discrete parametrized slope transform then reads: (x i ; y i ) ! ( x i x i1 x i y i1 x i1 y i ) (X i ; Y i ) (53) And the inverse discrete parametrized slope transform is: ( X i+1 X i

Reference-contexts: In that description, single-valuedness pertains; but if one chooses a functional description, set-valuedness results. Nevertheless, in this paper we follow the functional description, to connect to both standard morphological notation and to linear filtering. Because of this embedding, we have to generalize dilations slightly. Indeed, Ghosh <ref> [5] </ref> first pointed out that a dilation can be split into a highly symmetrical operation followed by a projection operation. We introduce the tangential dilation. <p> The need for a morphological signal processing theory has been clearly felt in recent literature, and there are numerous recent papers that point towards the slope transform. Ghosh <ref> [5] </ref> was among the first to recognize the central importance of slope for the description of mathematical morphology (his slope diagrams contain the `phase' information of the slope transform).

Reference-contexts: For two dimensions the bounding of the Laplacian in a classical opening (closing) by a paraboloid was derived in <ref> [6] </ref>. The connection between eq.(16) and that result is through the projection operator eq.(7), as we hope to show in a future paper. With the derivation of the second order properties, we have obtained an interesting sequence of equations for dilations.

Reference-contexts: However, to correspond to classical morphology, we might define a tangential erosion by: (f g)(x) (f g fl )(x) = stat u [f (u) g (u x)] (9) In classical morphology on functions, the definition of erosion is <ref> [7] </ref>: (f g)(x) = inf [f (x + h) g (h)] = inf [f (u) g (u x)] (10) which is obviously contained in eq.(9).

Reference-contexts: The notion of an interval-valued derivative is well-developed in convex analysis, where it is called a subdifferential (see <ref> [8] </ref>). We prefer to view such functions as limits of smooth functions with well-defined derivatives as such, they seem to present no essential problems. Both interpretations appear to be consistent. <p> Therefore only for a = ! does `stat' have a non-empty value, equal to b, and the result follows. 2 * cone to interval: jxj ! I (!) (41) Proof: We derive the result by taking limits of functions. We refer to <ref> [8] </ref> for proofs on the permissibility of taking limits, in the analogous case of convex functions. <p> It does appear to include all functions that would be interesting to morphological signal processing. The slope transform needs to be formalized properly. Two ways seem promising: one is the analogy to convex analysis (see e.g. <ref> [8] </ref>), of which the applicability to classical morphology has already been demonstrated by Mattioli [12]. The other approach is differential geometry, which has the natural means of dealing with self-intersecting differentiable surfaces. We plan to investigate the latter.

Reference-contexts: Mathematical morphology is an alternative way of combining signals. Where linear convolution is a good approximation to, for instance, the blurring in optical systems, morphological dilation is a good approximation to the contact-sensing processes of a scanning 1 tunnelling microscope <ref> [9] </ref>. Thus mathematical morphology and linear systems theory are two different tools to describe different aspects of nature. For the linear phenomena, an analytical theory is well established. It now becomes necessary to develop a theory of morphological signal processing to analyze the morphological phenomena. <p> Mattioli [12] gave differential equations for morphological operations in terms of the Young-Fenchel conjugate, which is also a special case of the slope transform. Physicists working on the scanning tunnelling microscope STM <ref> [9] </ref> use the classic Legendre transform to restore signals obtained by contact probing as we will show, the Legendre transform is yet another special case of the slope transform. The paper is organized as follows. <p> (H f (u) + H g (x u))H f (u) 1 = H g (x u) 1 + H f (u) 1 : (24) This result (but for classical dilation of convex functions) may be found (unproven) in an article by Keller on data analysis for a scanning tunnelling microscope <ref> [9] </ref>! In section 4.2 we will discuss this morphological machine in more detail. <p> Since the equation holds in one coordinate system, and is coordinate-independent, it holds in all. 2 This result is again found in the paper by Keller <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> Therefore one may expect rapid progress in the development of the theory of morphological signals and systems. Impressive llustrations of the effectiveness of applying the usual methods from signals analysis to morphology have recently appeared <ref> [9] </ref> [11]. We expect many more to follow. A second train of development can be the establishment of morphological scale spaces, analogous to the linear scale spaces [10]. <p> This is straightforward once the shape of the probe is known. However, it is not known, and it needs to be estimated from the input/output analysis of the system. Physicists have made some progress in this using the Legendre transform <ref> [9] </ref> in fact, they have derived some theorems that properly belong to morphology, such as the theorems on second derivatives of eq.(16), eq.(25) and eq.(30)! Here we sketch this solution in terms of the slope transform.

A second train of development can be the establishment of morphological scale spaces, analogous to the linear scale spaces <ref> [10] </ref>. In that context, it is interesting to note that the result eq.(35) shows that the quadratic functions x T Ax are eigenfunctions of the slope transform, just as the Gaussian functions exp (x T Ax) are eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform.

Reference-contexts: Note that the dilation of these two innocent functions leads to cusped, non-functional objects (at a = 1, a swallowtail catastrophe occurs at the point (0; 1), see <ref> [13] </ref>). This is a consequence of the consistent application of the slope theorem. Therefore, the cusps are not kinks: the curves that result are still differentiable.

This is straightforward once the shape of the probe is known.
