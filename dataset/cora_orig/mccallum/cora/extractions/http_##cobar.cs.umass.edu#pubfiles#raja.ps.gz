Abstract: Results from research in information retrieval have suggested that significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness can be obtained by combining results from multiple index representations, query formulations, and search strategies. The inference net model of retrieval, which was designed from this point of view, treats information retrieval as an evidential reasoning process where multiple sources of evidence about document and query content are combined to estimate relevance probabilities. In this paper, we use a system based on this model to study the retrieval effectiveness benefits of combining the types of document and query information that are found in typical commercial databases and information services. The results indicate that substantial real benefits are possible.

Reference-contexts: Examples of this are when both a Boolean query and a simple natural language query are used (Turtle & Croft, 1991a), or when multiple versions of a query are generated by search intermediaries <ref> (Belkin et al., 1993) </ref>. A query is processed by constructing the query network and attaching it to the document network. The attachment of the query concept nodes to the document network has no effect on the structure of the document network.

Reference-contexts: Different representations of the document content, different representations of the information need, and domain knowledge such as a thesaurus can all be taken into account under this model. INQUERY, a retrieval system based on this model, supports sophisticated indexing and complex query formulation <ref> (Callan et al., 1992) </ref>. INQUERY has been used successfully on a variety of text databases ranging up to a few gigabytes in size. <p> In what follows, we give a brief description of the inference net model on which this system is based, and the INQUERY query language. More details of INQUERY can be found in <ref> (Callan et al., 1992) </ref> and the inference net model in (Turtle, 1990; Turtle & Croft, 1991b; Turtle & Croft, 1991a). In this paper, the emphasis will be on the ability of the model to handle multiple sources of evidence.

Reference-contexts: Recently, an inference network-based probabilistic retrieval model has been proposed which views information retrieval as an evidential reasoning process in which multiple sources of evidence about document and query content are combined to estimate the probability that a given document matches an information need <ref> (Turtle & Croft, 1990) </ref>. Different representations of the document content, different representations of the information need, and domain knowledge such as a thesaurus can all be taken into account under this model. <p> It appears that a scale of two weights perform as well as a scale of three weights. These results also show that the inclusion of weights results in only very small (and not significant) improvements relative to the unweighted keyword query. This is consistent with a result reported in <ref> (Croft & Das, 1990) </ref> and suggests that more experiments are required to determine if user-supplied weights are an important part of query formulation.

Reference-contexts: This work also extends the original work of Katzer <ref> (Katzer et al., 1982) </ref> in that more combinations of representations are studied and, more importantly, does this in the context of a retrieval model designed for combining representations. 3 In more specific terms, we report the results of a series of experiments conducted using INQUERY to evaluate the following hypotheses: 1. <p> This is done for conciseness, and the general trends are so clear that the relative performance levels at high or low recall points are less important. A primary requirement for this study was the availability of a test collection supporting multiple representation types. We selected the INSPEC test collection <ref> (Katzer et al., 1982) </ref> for this study as it supports multiple document representations controlled vocabulary terms, keywords (indexer selected significant terms and phrases from document titles and abstracts) and the natural language text of titles and abstracts themselves.

Reference-contexts: The inference net model takes a slightly different approach in that it computes P (IjDocument), which is the probability that a user's information need is satisfied given a particular document. The inference net model is based on Bayesian inference networks <ref> (Pearl, 1988) </ref>. These are directed, acyclic dependency graphs (DAG) in which nodes represent propositional variables or constants and edges represent dependence relations between propositions. If a proposition represented by a node p "causes" or implies the proposition represented by node q, we draw a directed edge from p to q.

Reference-contexts: In Appendix 1, the relevant portions of a completed user profile information sheet used in a SDI service are shown, to illustrate the way this information is obtained <ref> (Rajashekar, 1988) </ref>. The descriptions of information needs are typically used to construct Boolean queries for Boolean logic (or exact-match) retrieval systems. <p> The perceived computational complexity of best-match retrieval models have been an hindrance for their use in large scale information services until recently <ref> (Rajashekar, 1988) </ref>. Given the processing capabilities of present day workstations, the availability of inexpensive storage options, and the demonstrated efficient implementation of these models (Turtle & Croft, 1991b; Harman & Candela, 1991), the situation is ripe for wider use of these techniques.

Reference-contexts: The inference net model is a probabilistic retrieval model in that it follows the Probability Ranking Principle. A probabilistic model calculates P (RelevantjDocument,Query), which is 4 the probability that a user decides a document is relevant given a particular document and query <ref> (Robertson, 1977) </ref>. The inference net model takes a slightly different approach in that it computes P (IjDocument), which is the probability that a user's information need is satisfied given a particular document. The inference net model is based on Bayesian inference networks (Pearl, 1988).

Reference-contexts: When two tests are being compared, we show the difference as the percentage change from the baseline test. A difference of 5 percent on average is generally considered significant, and a 10 percent difference is considered very significant <ref> (Sparck Jones & Bates, 1977) </ref>. These "rules-of-thumb" are based on differences that would be noticeable for a user. Standard tests of significance have generally not been used in recall-precision evaluations because of doubts about their validity (van Rijsbergen, 1979).

Reference-contexts: to assign weights to individual query or index representations within these combined representations. 3 Experimental Methodology The experiments reported in this paper were carried out using standard IR methodology in which a test collection consisting of documents, queries, and relevance judgements for each query, is used to generate recall-precision figures <ref> (Sparck Jones & van Rijsbergen, 1976) </ref>. Comparisons of retrieval effectiveness are made using tables of precision values at ten standard recall points (i.e., 10% of relevant documents retrieved, 20% : : : 100%)), averaged over a set of queries, for each of the query/index representations and their combination being evaluated.

Reference-contexts: While, in principle, computation of this probability would require O (2 n ) space for a node with n parents, since we only consider one document at a time in this model, a simple estimation formula can be used. The probability estimate that is used <ref> (Turtle & Croft, 1991a) </ref> is very similar to the tf.idf weights used in 5 d 1 I q k d j r 3 ... ... Z Z~ B BN ? @ = A Z B @ = Z Z~ many previous IR experiments (Salton & McGill, 1983). <p> The q k nodes are used in cases where multiple queries are used to represent the information need. Examples of this are when both a Boolean query and a simple natural language query are used <ref> (Turtle & Croft, 1991a) </ref>, or when multiple versions of a query are generated by search intermediaries (Belkin et al., 1993). A query is processed by constructing the query network and attaching it to the document network. <p> In earlier experiments 19 with the inference net model, however, much better improvements have been reported for the CACM collection <ref> (Turtle & Croft, 1991a) </ref>. The difference is probably mostly due to the nature of the test collections, in that the INSPEC collection is much larger.

Reference-contexts: This is repeated for each document in the network and the probabilities used to rank the documents. Simplifying assumptions made for efficient implementation of inference networks, their construction and evaluation, are discussed in <ref> (Turtle & Croft, 1991b) </ref>. The INQUERY query language provides a set of operators to specify concepts and relationships between concepts. This language is not designed to be used by searchers directly but rather is a target language for the user interface.
