Title: What is a Knowledge Representation?  
Author: Randall Davis Howard Shrobe Peter Szolovits 
Affiliation: MIT AI Lab  MIT AI Lab and Symbolics, Inc.  MIT Lab for Computer Science  
Abstract: Although knowledge representation is one of the central and in some ways most familiar concepts in AI, the most fundamental question about it|What is it?|has rarely been answered directly. Numerous papers have lobbied for one or another variety of representation, other papers have argued for various properties a representation should have, while still others have focused on properties that are important to the notion of representation in general. In this paper we go back to basics to address the question directly. We believe that the answer can best be understood in terms of five important and distinctly different roles that a representation plays, each of which places different and at times conflicting demands on the properties a representation should have. We argue that keeping in mind all five of these roles provides a usefully broad perspective that sheds light on some longstanding disputes and can invigorate both research and practice in the field.

Reference-contexts: It will also prove useful to take explicit note of the common practice of building knowledge representations in multiple levels of languages, typically with one of the knowledge representation technologies at the bottom level. Hayes' ontology of liquids <ref> [12] </ref>, for example, is at one level a representation composed of concepts like pieces of space, that have portals, faces, sides, etc. <p> Hence the ontological commitment made by a representation can be one of the most important contributions it offers. There is a long history of work attempting to build good ontologies for a variety of task domains, including early work on an ontology for liquids <ref> [12] </ref>, the lumped 3 The phrase "ontological commitment" is perhaps not precisely correct for what we have in mind here, but it is the closest available approximation.

Reference-contexts: Part of what makes a language 3 WHAT IS A KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION? 7 representational is that it carries meaning <ref> [13] </ref>, i.e., there is a correspondence between its constructs and things in the external world. That correspondence in turn carries with it constraint.

Epistemology does of course matter, and it may be useful to study it without the potentially distracting concerns about speed. <p> the representation. 4.2 Consequence for Research: Representation and Reasoning are Inter twined At various times in the development of the field, the suggestion has been made that we ought to view knowledge representation in purely epistemologic terms, i.e., take the singular role of representation to be conveying knowledge content (e.g., <ref> [13] </ref>). As we noted earlier, epistemology matters, but it is not the whole of the matter. Representation and reasoning are inextricably intertwined: we cannot talk about one without also, unavoidably, discussing the other. <p> That frames are not entirely distinct from logic seems clear; that all of the idea can be seen as logic seems considerably less clear. We believe that claims like those above are substantive only in the context of a narrowly construed notion of what a knowledge representation is. Hayes <ref> [13] </ref> is explicit about part of his position on this: "One can characterise a representational language as one which has (or can be given) a semantic theory" and explicit about the tight lines drawn around the argument: "Although frames are sometimes understood at the metaphysical level and sometimes at the computational

Methods in classes can be either lisp functions or rulesets.
