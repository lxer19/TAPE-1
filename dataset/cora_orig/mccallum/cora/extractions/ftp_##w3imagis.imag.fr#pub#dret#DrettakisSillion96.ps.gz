Title: Accurate Visibility and Meshing Calculations for Hierarchical Radiosity  
Author: George Drettakis, Franois Sillion 
Address: GRAVIR/IMAGINRIA  
Affiliation: iMAGIS Laboratoire  
Abstract: Precise quality control for hierarchical lighting simulations is still a hard problem, due in part to the difoculty of analysing the source of error and to the close interactions between different components of the algorithm. In this paper we attempt to address this issue by examining two of the most central components of these algorithms: visibility computation and the mesh. We orst present an investigation tool in the form of a new hierarchical algorithm: this algorithmic extension encapsulates exact visibility information with respect to the light source in the form of the backprojection data structure, and allows the use of discontinuity meshes in the solution hierarchy. This tool permits us to study separately the effects of visibility and meshing error on image quality, computational expense as well as solution convergence. Initial experimental results are presented by comparing standard quadtreebased hierarchical radiosity with pointsampling visibility to the approaches incorporating backprojections, discontinuity meshes or both.

Reference-contexts: hopefully, result in an overall higher quality global illumination simulation. 4.4 Reonement criteria In traditional HR approaches, iBFj reonement has been used, which essentially requires a link between two surface elements to be reoned if their mutual formfactor multiplied by the power on the link is larger than a threshold <ref> [8] </ref>. The philosophy of this approach is to reduce the respective size of the elements on the two sides of a link, thus reducing visibility error since all interactions tend to be either occluded or visible ([19]), and reducing iintegration errorj of the area formfactor integral since the kernel varies. <p> Subdivision will be thus better adapted to the variation of irradiance on the receiver, since the source in never subdivided. 4.5 Convergence The issue of convergence is rarely addressed in HR research. Following the original deonition and structure of the algorithm <ref> [8] </ref>, we deone convergence as a sequence of iterations involving a Reone step followed by an (optional) loop of GatherPush/Pull operations until the result is no longer modioed. The iteration terminates when no new links are created (iconvergencej). <p> For the two scenes, we have attempted to maintain approximately the same number of elements, to provide a ifairj comparison. This requires the judicious choice of parameters BF*, minimum area size and the visibility factor as deoned in <ref> [8] </ref>. The resulting images for iBooksj are shown in colour in Figure 5, while small versions of iDesk+Chairj are shown in Figure 2. Meshes for iDesks+Chairj are shown for illustration in Fig. 4 for cases QT/BP and DM/BP. The numerical results are summarised in Table 1.

Reference-contexts: In the case where QT/BP is numerically better, the difference is insigniocant. Meshing Discontinuity meshing without exact visibility results in visual artifacts, and is computationally expensive. This is particularly evident for iDesk+Chairj (Fig. 2). Previous algorithms avoided this problem by using ional gatherj type approaches <ref> [12] </ref> Nonetheless, the irregular meshes produced add a high overhead in the global solution, simply by the shear number of leaf elements at the outset (Table 1) (a similar observation was made by Lischinski et al. [12]). <p> Previous algorithms avoided this problem by using ional gatherj type approaches <ref> [12] </ref> Nonetheless, the irregular meshes produced add a high overhead in the global solution, simply by the shear number of leaf elements at the outset (Table 1) (a similar observation was made by Lischinski et al.

Reference-contexts: Discontinuity meshing provides an appropriate solution to the problems of visual representation of shadow boundaries. The problems with such meshes are however numerous. Other than the issues related to numerical accuracy in construction <ref> [19] </ref>, these meshes tend to contain far too many elements ([4]), and they result in badly formed triangles which pose problems for interpolation/extrapolation operations as well as being formally unadaptable to onite element approaches ([13]). <p> Given the mesh and backprojections, two important changes can be incorporated into the treatment of the direct illumination links: characterisation of links as partial, occluded or unoccluded (in the spirit of <ref> [19] </ref>) can be performed accurately immediately after the discontinuity meshing step and the calculation of irradiance values at the vertices during the solution is exact.
