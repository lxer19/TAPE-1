Abstract: Fault recovery techniques must be reexamined in the light of the new guaranteed performance services that networks will support. We investigate the rerouting of guaranteed performance service connections on the occurrence of link faults, focussing on the aspects of route selection and establishment in the network. In a previous investigation, we explored some components of rerouting in the presence of single link faults in the network. In this paper we study the behavior of our techniques in the presence of multiple link faults in the network, and also examine the technique of retries to improve the success of rerouting. Our schemes are simulated on a cross-section of network work-loads, and compared using the criteria of the fraction of the affected traffic that could be rerouted, the time to reroute and the amount of resources consumed in the network. A novel metric, the Queueing Delay Load Index, which captures both the bandwidth and delay demands made on the network by a connection, is used to present and analyze the results. hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh This research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Cooperative Agreement NCR-8919038 with the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, by AT&T Bell Laboratories, Hitachi, Ltd., Hitachi America, Ltd., Pacific Bell, the University of California under a MICRO grant, and the International Computer Science Institute.

Reference-contexts: However, a significant amount of work has been published in the area of GPC schemes (without fault recovery), and of fault recovery in other contexts. Several investigators have proposed schemes for GPC service in packet switched networks. The Tenet group 2 has devised an approach <ref> [1] </ref> to the provision of such services, which we assume as part of our underlying network model and describe briefly in Section 4. <p> PlaNET [26] performs bandwidth reservation using an equivalent bandwidth model. All these schemes have some basic similarity; indeed it can be argued <ref> [1] </ref> that any scheme that provides a similar service with the same set of assumptions about the network must to have the properties of resource reservation, admission control, connection-orientedness with pre-computed routes, and a service discipline or policing strategy which protects one connection from another. <p> The Tenet Scheme The Tenet scheme allows the network to provide guaranteed performance communication services. In this service a guaranteed performance connection (a real-time channel) is an abstraction that defines communication services with guaranteed traffic and performance parameters in a packet-switched network <ref> [1] </ref>. A channel's traffic is characterized by: X min , the minimum packet inter-arrival time, X ave , the average packet inter-arrival time over an averaging interval I, and, S max , the maximum packet size.

Reference-contexts: Our fault recovery schemes make as few assumptions as possible about the underlying GPC schemes, hence we believe that they would work well with any of the above GPC service schemes. 3 Fault recovery in telecommunication networks has been presented in <ref> [6] </ref> in the context of a layered model of the transport network. At the highest layer, the switched layer, the unit of communication and fault recovery is the call. <p> Optimal solutions of route selection involve exponential computational complexity, and all other solutions involve trade-offs between time and goodness of the solution. Alternate route establishment, which changes the resource state in the network to reflect these new routes, involves cooperation, since network resources must be shared. In the literature <ref> [6] </ref>, the approaches to rerouting have been classified along three axes: Centralized vs. Distributed schemes, Link rerouting vs End-To-End rerouting, and Pre-computation vs dynamic computation of routes. <p> We consider three locus of reroute types: Global reroutes, Local reroutes, and Hybrid reroutes. With a Global reroute, which corresponds to the end-to-end rerouting of <ref> [6] </ref>, the path of the rerouted connection is determined at the source node based on the current network load and the traffic and performance characteristics of the connection. <p> It also localizes the effect of the reroute to the immediate neighborhood of the fault, which might improve performance for multiple faults. It corresponds roughly to link rerouting of <ref> [6] </ref>, except that the complete round-trip for route establishment implies better resource balancing, higher success rates, but longer establishment times.

Reference-contexts: Conventional computer data networks are mostly based on a connection-less paradigm (e.g. Internet). Fault recovery in these networks consists of recomputing routing information to route new data correctly. In the Internet no performance guarantees are given, though the protocols attempt to reduce congestion and network instabilities [16,17,18]. AN1 <ref> [19] </ref> and AN2 are local area networks designed for high survivability. AN1 is packet switched and connection-less, while AN2 is ATM based, connection-oriented and supports CBO (fixed bandwidth) traffic.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Guaranteed Performance Communication 1 (GPC) has been recognized as an important service from future wide-area broadband-ISDNs <ref> [23] </ref>. Several GPC schemes have been proposed to date; however, they all assume adequate fault-free service from the underlying network. The high level management features needed for such schemes are still under investigation.

Reference-contexts: Fault recovery consists of the tasks of fault detection, recovery instigation, computing and distributing new state information, and rerouting the affected traffic. Our investigation focusses on the rerouting of GPC connections in a network with redundant connectivity after the occurrence of link faults. In a previous paper <ref> [24] </ref> we investigated rerouting to recover from single faults in the network along two orthogonal components. In this paper we extend the investigation to multiple faults, which aggravates the problem of route collisions (see Section 4.2). <p> In Section 5 we present our experimental design. In Section 6 we present and analyze our results. In Section 7 we summarize our results and mention directions of future research. 2. Related work In <ref> [24] </ref> we investigated fault recovery for GPC networks in the presence of single link faults along two components: the locus of reroute (which determines the section of the failed route over which a reroute is attempted) and the reroute timing (which determines when the actual attempt to acquire resources over the <p> Thus Global is more efficient than Local or Hybrid at low load. These conclusions are similar to the results published in <ref> [24] </ref> in which single faults without retries were explored. If we look at the multiple retries (the striped bars in the same graphs) the first surprising observation is that retries do not seem improve the success ratios.
