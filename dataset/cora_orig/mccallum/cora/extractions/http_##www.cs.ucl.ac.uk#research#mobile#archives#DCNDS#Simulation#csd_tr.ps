Abstract: 1 Abstract In this paper, we describe a simulation environment which is used to examine, validate, and predict the performance of mobile wireless network systems. This simulation environment overcomes many of the limitations found with analytical models, experimentation, and other commercial network simulators available on the market today. This paper describes the simulation language, Maisie, which is used to analyze the performance bottlenecks of a multimedia wireless network system being developed at UCLA. By modeling the various components and their integration, this simulation environment is able to accurately predict the performance bottlenecks of the UCLA wireless multimedia networking terminal, determine the trade-off point between the various bottlenecks, and provide performance measurements which are not possible through experimentation and too complex for analysis.

Reference-contexts: Measurements such as Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) are fed back from the radio into the link control algorithms to do power control and minimize the power consumption of the link, reduce interference, and provide admission control such as described in <ref> [2] </ref>. 2.2 Operating System To integrate all these network control components together, an operating system is desired such as we see in Figure 3. <p> We plan to integrate the two preceding models to study the performance of the protocols as a function of the radio and NOS characteristics. The simulation environment was designed using an existing simulation language call Maisie <ref> [2] </ref>. Maisie has been implemented on both sequential and parallel architectures including distributed memory machines link the IBM SP2 and shared-memory multiprocessor machines like the Sun Sparc 1000. The experiments reported in this study used only the sequential Maisie implementations.

Reference-contexts: A public domain network oper ating system (NOS, also known as KA9Q developed by Phil Karn) designed to support packet radio meets the exibility requirements <ref> [4] </ref>. It runs on top of DOS and includes its own multitasking scheduler. The benefit of this multitasking operating system is that each algorithm or protocol necessary to support this network can be developed as its own process.

Reference-contexts: Since many of the proposed schemes for supporting instant and reconfigurable network topologies are based upon TDMA to control channel contention. A clustering algorithm <ref> [10] </ref> was implemented which is heavily based on TDMA control and synchronization to test the feasibility and overhead of implementing this functionality in software. 2.1.4 Link Layer Control The Data Link layer shown in Figure 2 supports a new function unique to wireless networking for mobility control. <p> The subnetwork layer models are used to model the topology creation (instant infrastructure), reconfigurability, adaptive channel assignment (CDMA), and wireless multihop routing. As an example of a NAM, below is a Maisie fragment for the clusterhead election algorithm found in <ref> [10] </ref>. The basic idea of the algorithm is that between any two nodes that can communicate, the node with the lowest ID should become the clusterhead with the restriction that two clusterheads can not communicate Appl.
