Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The "chirplet transform", first proposed in <ref> [1] </ref>, is an extension of the well-known wavelet transform [2]. Informally speaking, a chirplet may be regarded as a "piece of a chirp" (windowed swept-frequency wave) in the same manner a wavelet could be loosely regarded as a "piece of a wave" (windowed tone). <p> The Adaptive "Chirplet" Transform 3 utility as a classifier, in pattern recognition tasks. Chirplets have been successfully applied to many practical applications, such as radar imaging, machine vision, and characterizing the acceleration signature of objects <ref> [1] </ref> using Doppler. Chirplets have also been applied to more artistic endeavours [5], such as computer enhanced "light painting" (camera parameter estimation with respect to composites of multiple exposures). In this paper only the one dimensional chirplet is presented. The extension to two or more dimensions is not difficult. <p> The "ellipses" may also adaptively "tilt", if desired. (In other words the time series associated with each center may chirp. An alternative chirplet space, the "bowtie" space <ref> [1] </ref>, is also presented in the context of LEM. <p> In English, we coin the term "chirplet". Figure 1 shows that the relationship of a chirplet to a chirp is analogous to that of a wavelet to a wave. This work was first published 6 in Mann and Haykin <ref> [1] </ref>; the term "chirplet" also appears later in the literature [8], although with a different meaning. The TF-affine chirplet consists of all the members of a particular time-domain signal, which are affine transformations of each other when viewed in TF space. <p> Indexdimension is analogous to tensor rank. "Vectordimension", however, refers to the size of the array. 6 Some of the work of Mann and Haykin <ref> [1] </ref> was presented briefly as part of "Radar Vision"[7], prior to publication. 6 Steve Mann and Simon Haykin terms of time series and magnitude Time-Frequency (TF) distributions. The "physical-affinity" of the wavelet is first extended to TF-affinity by adding up and down translation and shear in TF space. <p> We obtain the slant by using a Gaussian enveloped chirp. In this case, we have four degrees of freedom: t c , f c , aspect ratio (slenderness), and rotation angle. The Adaptive "Chirplet" Transform 33 3.6 LEM in frequency-frequency ("bowtie") space The frequency-frequency (FF) space <ref> [1] </ref> is a particular slice through the chriplet transform space. It is equivalent to a Hough (Radon) transform of the Wigner distribution. Points in the "bowtie" chirplet transform (BCT) space correspond to straight lines in time-frequency space. <p> The Adaptive "Chirplet" Transform 35 While the non-adaptive chirplet has been successfully applied to many problems, such as Doppler processing <ref> [1] </ref>, "radar vision"[7], machine vision and camera parameter estimation [5], and image processing, adaptivity provides two distinct advantages over the non-adaptive chirplet by providing: * a compact description of the signal. * a possible means of classification.

Two such methods, however, have already been discovered <ref> [4] </ref>, thus, for the sake of completeness, we will include all six parameters in our discussion, where the reader is free strip away the TF-area parameter if linearity is desired.

Reference-contexts: In that space, the adaptivity appears as a number of ./ shaped centers which also move about to fit the input distribution. 2 Review of The Non-Adaptive Chirplet Before discussing the adaptive chirplet, we provide here a brief outline of the non-adaptive chirplet, following <ref> [6] </ref>. The well-known wavelet transform was derived through one-dimensional affine transformations in the physical (e.g. time) domain. A basic primitive, known as a mother wavelet is chosen and all other basis functions are derived from it by affine transformations in the physical domain. <p> The Adaptive "Chirplet" Transform 9 Recently, however, we have become interested in a set of bases which match phenomena whose time-frequency evolution is periodic in nature. We have identified a particular class of chirplet <ref> [6] </ref> which has a very profound significance, as well as practical applications in fields such as marine radar. To emphasize this special class of chirplets, we have coined the word "warblet".

Philosophically, there are two ways to think of this basis function: 1. Using the "piece-of-a-chirp" framework. 2.

Reference-contexts: Our tendency to favour the prolate over other equally valid functions is mainly for illustrative purposes; in choosing a mother chirplet, one must consider each problem individually. We have, however, concentrated on the prolate, in developing an extension of Thom-son's method of multiple windows <ref> [14] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Time-Frequency Space: An Adaptive Generalized Wavelet Like Trans form 3.1 Introduction We propose 7 a signal-dependent Time-Frequency method, "Logon Expectation Maximization" (LEM), based on Expectation Maximization (EM). 7 It has recently been observed that our LEM paradigm is, in some ways, similar to the earlier work of Jones et al <ref> [15] </ref>, although our approach is quite different. 10 Steve Mann and Simon Haykin We first generalize Gabor's notion of logons [16]. (a logon is a "tile" in the tiling of the TF plane) to depict both the Weyl-Heisenberg (e.g. constant bandwidth spectrogram) as well as the physically-affine (wavelet) transforms, each as

They then compute the volume. We take a slightly different approach, starting with Gabor's <ref> [16] </ref> definition of the effective duration of a pulse: = [2 ( m 0 m 1 ) 2 )] 1=2 (3) where m k denotes the kth moment of the energy or power of the signal.

Reference-contexts: This constraint is often referred to in the literature (using the term loosely) as the uncertainty principle. We wish to derive a measure of concentration in time-frequency space. There are a number of such measures in the literature. One such example (Baraniuk et al <ref> [18] </ref>, and Vakman [19]), considers the normalized volume of a TF distribution to be a quantity which we wish to minimize. In other words, Baraniuk et al determine the maximum of the TF distribution, then normalize the whole distribution so that the maximum is one. They then compute the volume.

Reference-contexts: Since 22 are all positive, S is always real. When S is diagonal, the distribution is aligned along the cartesian axes, t and f . With off-diagonal elements, however, there is some tilt or shear present. We may diagonalize the matrix of variances, S, with an eigendecomposition, as follows <ref> [20] </ref>: S = VflV 1 (8) where V is a unitary matrix, and fl is a diagonal matrix, given by: fl = 1 0 # Since V is unitary, its inverse is given by V 1 , so the eigendecomposition becomes: S = VflV y (10) Since S is real, V

Our variant of EM The Adaptive "Chirplet" Transform 17 follows directly from Hinton <ref> [23] </ref>, where he outlines three steps to fitting a distribution by a sum of Gaussians: * For each data point, d, compute the probability density p (dji) for each unit, i, using the current mean and variance for that unit. * Normalize these probability densities to get the probability that each <p> We may also wish to adapt the variances of the distributions. Unlike the general probability distributions, we desire to maintain a constant area logon. Thus, rather than changing the diameter of the circle, as is done in approximating probability density functions (Hinton <ref> [23] </ref>), we allow the aspect ratio to vary. Such a hypothetical example is illustrated in Figure 11, with the corresponding time-domain representation in Figure 12. These functions are neither affine wavelets (wavelets of constant shape), nor are they modulated versions of a single function as in the spectrogram basis.
