Abstract: Spasticity following spinal cord injury (SCI) is most often assessed clinically using a five-point Ashworth Score (AS). A more objective assessment of altered motor control may be achieved by using a comprehensive protocol based on a surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity recorded from thigh and leg muscles. However, the relation between clinical and neurophysiological assessments is still unknown. In this paper we employ three different classification methods to investigate this relationship. The experimental results indicate that, if the appropriate set of sEMG features is used, the neurophysiological assessment is related to clinical findings and can be used to predict the AS. A comprehensive and objective sEMG assessment may be proven useful for the assessment of interventions and follow-up of SCI patients.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Assessment of spasticity following spinal cord injury (SCI) often represents a significant problem. Based on classical definition of spasticity, a qualitative five-point Ashworth Score (AS) <ref> [1] </ref> has been developed and the examiner grades to what degree a limb or a limb segment resists passive movements. Surface recordings of electromyographic (sEMG) activity from thigh and leg muscles may be useful to get a more objective assessment of altered motor control and spasticity following SCI [5].

Reference-contexts: The instance is then classified to a majority class of the neighboring instances. We use a D. Wettschereck's implementation of k-NN called NGE [6], the Euclidean distance measure, and k = 10. Linear discriminant analysis <ref> [2] </ref> is a statistical method that for a two-class problem aims to derive a hyper-plane in the form a 0 + a 1 x 1 + : : : a n x n = 0 where a i are the coefficients and x i are the features used in the data

Reference-contexts: This obtains a decision tree that is both a representation of the underlying data and can be used to classify new, previously unseen instances. Examples of such decision trees are shown in Figure 1. In this work, we use a well-known implementation of TDIDT called C4.5 <ref> [3] </ref>. k-NN is an instance-based classifier that, given an instance to classify, searches the data set for k instances that are the closest to that instance according to a suitable distance measure. The instance is then classified to a majority class of the neighboring instances. We use a D.

Reference-contexts: Given a data set, a TDIDT machine learning algorithm develops a classifier in the form of a decision tree <ref> [4] </ref>. Starting with the whole data set, it first develops a condition based on a single feature that best discriminates between the classes. Such condition splits the data set to two data sets.

However, the relationship between the clinical and neurophysiological assessments is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to find out whether there is a relationship between clinical and neurophysiological assessments of spasticity, and if so, which neurophysiological features are most useful in predicting the clinical findings. <p> Prior to all sEMG recordings, same clinician assessed a muscle tone in the lower limb by performing a passive hip and knee (hip/knee) flexion and extension maneuver and gave a single AS for the entire lower limb. A comprehensive neurophysiological assessment was subsequently performed <ref> [5] </ref> in part of which a passive hip/knee flexion and extension maneuver, identical to the one used by the clinician for the AS, as well as a passive ankle flexion and extension maneuver were repeated 3 times, respectively.
