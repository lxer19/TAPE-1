Reference-contexts: Our results indicate that the fitness rule can be quite a powerful heuristic for designing search strategies in certain contexts. We should point out that our results hold even if the state space being explored is a layered directed graph instead of a tree. By contrast, a recent paper <ref> [1] </ref> on the quadratic dynamical systems gave evidence that the mating rule is not as powerful as had been assumed. 2 Finding deep vertices on a tree In this section, we introduce a simple model for certain randomized optimization algorithms, which we shall view as a rule for moving a particle

Reference-contexts: The tree model was designed to capture precisely the effect of lowering the temperature walking towards the leaves corresponds to lowering the temperature (as explained in section 3). There has been extensive experimental study of variants of simulated annealing such as random restarts (see for example <ref> [2] </ref>, and [7]).

Reference-contexts: Our results suggest that it might be fruitful to study the performance of a "go with the winners" implementation for simulated annealing. "Go with the winners" schemes are obviously reminiscent of genetic algorithms <ref> [3] </ref> they incorporate a "survival of the fittest" rule, but do not incorporate a "mating rule" for combining pairs of solutions to obtain a new one. Our results indicate that the fitness rule can be quite a powerful heuristic for designing search strategies in certain contexts.

Reference-contexts: Now the group of particles does not disperse as time increases but stays within O (1) of its randomly-moving center of mass. With appropriate scaling, the K ! 1 limit is a process of unit mass moving randomly in space, essentially the Fleming-Viot process <ref> [4] </ref>, and this is one of a family of measure-valued diffusions studied under the name of superprocesses. There are however two important differences between our optimization algorithm setting and the theoretical probabilist's setting. First, we have an objective function that we use to choose which particle to move.

Reference-contexts: A notable exception is an analysis of the case when the function to be minimized has a special kind of fractal-like structure, where [10] proved that simulated annealing runs in polynomial time. There are now several results (see for example <ref> [6] </ref>) that analyze the Metropolis algorithm, which is the special case of running simulated annealing at a fixed temperature. These results use sophisticated methods to bound mixing rates of Markov chains.

Reference-contexts: Our original motivation for studying this concrete tree setting was that it mimics the polynomial time behavior of simulated annealing (see section 3). The polynomial time behavior of simulated annealing is notoriously hard to analyze rigorously. Many early results such as <ref> [8] </ref> apply only to the situation where the running time is allowed to grow exponentially in the problem size.
