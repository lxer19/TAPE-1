Abstract: Mobile computing and multimedia are two emerging trends in computer systems. One foreseeable application suggested by these two trends is the playback of stored video on both mobile devices and conventional workstations. A system supporting such an application must provide performance-guaranteed delivery of video data to different types of clients, some of which may be mobile. In this paper, we address some of the issues involved in supporting such an application, namely the efficient layout of multiple representations of video data on a file Two recent trends in computer systems are the emergence of small, mobile computers using wireless networks and the increasing popularity of multimedia applications. These can be combined in new and interesting ways to produce a new class of personal, multimedia applications. One such application is the playback of stored video to mobile devices; one can imagine a video server which retrieves video sequences on demand for playback on the displays of hand-held, portable computing devices as well as conventional workstations. Such a playback application has implications for both the storage and transport of data. The data storage and network facilities must provide for the timely delivery of large amounts of information to a variety of client machines, whose locations may change over time. Current hardware and software technology has addressed at least some of these points. Storage and retrieval of large amounts of data can be efficiently performed using Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAIDs), such as the RAID-II prototype storage server [Lee92]. RAIDs use parallel transfers from an array of drives to support high data transfer rates and high request rates. Real-time (performance-guaranteed) network services to support multimedia applications can be performed using (for example) the Tenet Real-Time Protocol Suite [Ferrari92]. This approach uses connection-oriented resource allocation to provide guarantees on performance parameters, such as delay, bandwidth, delay jitter, and buffering. server and network support for host mobility.

Reference-contexts: In a mobile environment, the computing facilities available to perform such processing on the clients will be limited by the power budget. One solution to this problem is to store multiple representations of the video data on the server, using an encoding such as scalable compression <ref> [Chang93] </ref>. The storage of multiple representations allows the server to more closely satisfy client format requirements; clients then only need to perform decompression. The storage system must ensure that video data arrive at the clients with low delay variance (jitter) and perhaps with low latency.

Reference-contexts: To minimize the disruptions in the video playback, the time required to complete this rerouting (also known as a handoff) must be minimized. Although there has been considerable work in supporting mobility in computer networks, much of it, such as <ref> [Ioannidis91, Teraoka91] </ref>, has focused on IP, a connectionless network layer that cannot support hard performance guarantees. <p> However, with the introduction of mobile hosts using fixed network addresses, this correspondence is no longer valid. Therefore, it necessary to use new host location algorithms.

Reference-contexts: This scheme requires only a small layer of functionality to be added on top of the multicast facility in order to support mobility. A more complete description of these algorithms, as well as a preliminary analysis, can be found in <ref> [Keeton93a] </ref>. We are constructing a trace-driven simulator that we will use to quantitatively evaluate the performance of these approaches under various workloads and network configurations. 4.2 Connection Establishment In current wired network environments, host addresses provide important routing information.

Reference-contexts: It models the lowest-level components of the array (for example, the disks) in detail and uses approximations for the higher-level components (such as software delays on the file server). We are currently studying the performance of these and other layout strategies. Preliminary results are presented in <ref> [Keeton93b] </ref>. 3.2 Additional Factors in Providing Continuous Media File Service The storage of multiple representations of the same file allows some optimization of the system admission control policy.

Reference-contexts: They provide no real-time guarantee on the retrieval time of video data. Several file systems have been designed and optimized specifically for continuous media data <ref> [Rangan91, Lougher93] </ref>. Although they address the needs of multimedia applications and can guarantee performance on file retrieval through the use of admission control, they do not support multiple representations of data. <p> Each of the layout schemes stores video data in retrieval blocks, whose sizes are defined based on user access patterns. In our system, the data for a retrieval block corresponds to one seconds worth of playback data, as is done in <ref> [Lougher93] </ref>. While the data for a single retrieval block is stored contiguously on the disk array, logically contiguous retrieval blocks are not necessarily stored in a physically contiguous manner. Each retrieval blocks data is striped across rows of the disk array.
