Title: Elastic Bands: Connecting Path Planning and Control  
Author: Sean Quinlan and Oussama Khatib 
Affiliation: Robotics Laboratory Computer Science Department Stanford University  
Abstract: Elastic bands are proposed as the basis for a new framework to close the gap between global path planning and real-time sensor-based robot control. An elastic band is a deformable collision-free path. The initial shape of the elastic is the free path generated by a planner. Subjected to artificial forces, the elastic band deforms in real time to a short and smooth path that maintains clearance from the obstacles. The elastic continues to deform as changes in the environment are detected by sensors, enabling the robot to accommodate uncertainties and react to unexpected and moving obstacles. While providing a tight connection between the robot and its environment, the elastic band preserves the global nature of the planned path. This paper outlines the framework and discusses an efficient implementation based on bubbles.

Reference-contexts: Path planning uses models of the world and robot to compute a path for the robot to reach its goal. It has been shown that the general problem is computationally expensive although much progress has been made in producing fast planners for practical situations <ref> [1] </ref>. The output of a path planner is a continuous path along which the robot will not collide with the obstacles. However, any model of the real world will be incomplete and inaccurate, thus collisions may still occur if the robot moves blindly along such a path.

Reference-contexts: One conventional application is for the robot to track a trajectory. More recently, work has been done on increasing the level of competence of control systems, for example, by including real-time collision avoidance capabilities <ref> [2] </ref>. Such local or reactive behaviors operate in real time but cannot solve the global problem of moving to an arbitrary goal. To build a complete system we would like to combine these two approaches. A path planner provides a global solution to move the robot to the goal.

Reference-contexts: A New Framework We propose a new framework to close the gap between path planning and control. The idea is to implement local sensor based motions by deforming in real time the path computed by the planner. We call such a deforming collision-free path an elastic band <ref> [3] </ref>. We can view this framework as a three level hierarchy, as depicted in figure 1. At each level there is a closed loop with the environment whose reaction time decreases from slow (at the planning level) to very fast (at the control level).

Reference-contexts: Of course, the actual rate depends on the particular application but a reasonable goal might be ten Hertz. In many respects, elastic bands are similar to snakes <ref> [4] </ref>. A snake, as used in computer vision, is a deformable curve guided by artificial forces designed to pull it towards features in an image. The major difference is that an elastic band must represent a collision free path for the robot.

Reference-contexts: We must be able to restrict the position of the points so that the continuous curve is a collision free path. To check that a curve is collision free, we must examine the configuration space, or c-space, of the robot <ref> [5] </ref>. The free space of a robot is the area of the c-space in which the robot does not touch any obstacles. The determination of whether a path lies in the free space is difficult for two reasons.
