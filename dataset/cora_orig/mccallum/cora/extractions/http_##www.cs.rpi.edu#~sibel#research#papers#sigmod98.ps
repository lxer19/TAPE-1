Title: A Multi-Similarity Algebra

Abstract: The need to automatically extract and classify the contents of multimedia data archives such as images, video, and text documents has led to significant work on similarity based retrieval of data. To date, most work in this area has focused on the creation of index structures for similarity based retrieval. There is very little work on developing formalisms for querying multimedia databases that support similarity based computations and optimizing such queries, even though it is well known that feature extraction and identification algorithms in media data are very expensive. We introduce a similarity algebra that brings together relational operators and results of multiple similarity implementations in a uniform language. The algebra can be used to specify complex queries that combine different interpretations of similarity values and multiple algorithms for computing these values. We prove equivalence and containment relationships between similarity algebra expressions and develop query rewriting methods based on these results. We then provide a generic cost model for evaluating cost of query plans in the similarity algebra and query optimization methods based on this model. We supplement the paper with experimental results that illustrate the use of the algebra and the effectiveness of query optimization methods using the Integrated Search Engine (I.SEE) as the testbed.

Reference-contexts: In cases when the user does not have access to the actual attributes, properties may denote a region in the similarity search space. In search engines, an object template can be a list of keywords or a conjunction of query attributes as in the I.SEE system (Integrated Search Engine <ref> [1] </ref>). An example template can be a list of keywords such as "PostModern Culture Netzine". A document matching such a template may have properties such as URL, title, abstract. This is consistent with image retrieval implementations that retrieve pictures that are similar to a sketch input by the user. <p> The description of the generic query language for Internet search engines and query specification in this generic language can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. An expression of the form ae E (EDB; Q1; 10) requests the first 10 documents that are most similar to the description Q1 in the database for Excite. <p> Most existing research on similarity based retrieval to date falls into three classes. The first class aims at defining what constitutes similarity, and has been studied by many researchers in the context of text/document data <ref> [6, 17, 1, 1] </ref>, image data [3, 9, 11, 14], and audio data [5]. Santini and Jain [15] provide a good overview of different approaches to similarity.

Reference-contexts: In either case, we need to use query rewriting methods that depend on syntactic or semantic description of query contents. Such methods were discussed in the literature for different applications <ref> [2, 16] </ref>. Extending these methods to the similarity algebraic operations is beyond the scope of this paper. In addition to the tree compaction operator, we use the traditional selection push operators below join operations. The intended gain in pushing selections is the reduction of the number of tuples processed.
