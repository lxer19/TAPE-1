Title: Robust and Efficient Detection of Convex Groups  
Author: David W. Jacobs

Affiliation: NEC Research Institute  
Abstract: This paper describes an algorithm that robustly locates convex collections of line segments in an image. The algorithm is guaranteed to find all convex sets of line segments in which the length of the line segments accounts for at least some fixed proportion of the length of their convex hull. This enables the algorithm to find convex groups whose contours are partially occluded or missing due to noise. We perform an expected case analysis of the algorithm's performance that shows that its run time is O(n 2 log(n) + nm), when we wish to find the m most salient groups in an image with n line segments. We support this analysis with experiments on real data. Our analysis not only reveals the circumstances under which our algorithm is efficient, but also tells us when the groups found are unlikely to occur at random, and so are likely to capture the underlying structure of a scene. We also demonstrate the grouping system as a module in an efficient recognition system that combines grouping with indexing 2 .

Reference-contexts: However, the previous work provides a more thorough analysis of proximity as a grouping clue, and treats the orientations of groups of lines in general, not just orientations that are mutually convex. Wayner [48] also used convexity as a grouping method, followed by indexing. Basri and Jacobs <ref> [1] </ref> describes a recognition method that depends explicitly on matching convex regions of images to convex components of objects. Some systems have used image groups that are not only convex, but contain other special properties as well. Acronym [6] modeled objects using generalized cylinders that were convex.

Reference-contexts: Hoffman and Richards [21], for example, suggest dividing objects into parts at concave discontinuities. And Biederman [3] suggests performing recognition using the invariant qualities of an object's parts and their relations. These parts tend to be convex. In fact, in implementing a version of Biederman's work, Bergevin and Levine <ref> [2] </ref> rely on convexity to find the parts of an object. Convexity may be useful for other types of matching problems, such as motion analysis or stereo. Mohan and Nevatia [38], for example, perform stereo matching between groups of line segments that form partial parallelograms in each image.

Reference-contexts: For example, trapezoids are found that have nearby endpoints. A variety of authors have proposed more general approaches to recognition that rely on finding the parts of objects.

Reference-contexts: Second, we consider past efforts at making grouping systems efficient. Third, we describe the role that convexity has played in a variety of approaches to image understanding. The use of non-accidental properties in grouping has been developed by Witkin and Tenenbaum [50], Binford <ref> [4] </ref>, Kanade [31], Lowe [34] and Richards and Jepson [42]. These authors argue that the visual system is sensitive to properties commonly produced by a single object or process, and rarely occurring at random.

Reference-contexts: Other approaches have attempted to efficiently integrate more global information into grouping. For example, a hierarchical approach can be used that makes local decisions at a variety of scales, allowing for the integration of information from more spatially separated parts of the image. Boldt, Weiss and Riseman <ref> [5] </ref> take this approach in detecting collinear groups, while Dolan and Riseman [14] and Saund [44] apply hierarchical methods to cocircu-larity detection. Mahoney [36] uses parallel processing to gain efficiency in an algorithm that extracts smooth, connected curves.

Reference-contexts: Others have also explicitly used grouping, or the formation of more complex features, to speed up recognition systems (Jacobs [24, 25], Califano and Mohan [8], Clemens [10], Syeda-Mahmood [47], Burns and Riseman <ref> [7] </ref>, Huttenlocher and Wayner [23] and Wayner [48]).

Reference-contexts: If one looks first at these groups, one can achieve significant speedups in a recognition system, compared to performing a random search.

Reference-contexts: The system begins with line segments that we obtain by running a Canny edge detector <ref> [9] </ref> (in the experiments shown, = 2), and then using a split-and-merge algorithm based on Horowitz and Pavlidis [40] to approximate these edges with straight lines.

Reference-contexts: The interaction between grouping and the computational complexity of recognition is treated more theoretically by Grimson [17] and Clemens and Jacobs <ref> [11] </ref>. Most past work on contour grouping has focused on using a small set of properties identified by Gestalt psychologists: proximity, symmetry, parallelism, collinearity and smooth continuation (although Williams [49] has explored the role of topological constraints in grouping).

Reference-contexts: Scerpo can then form larger groups by finding chains of features connected by these pairwise relations. The system has low complexity, but the decision about what lines to group together rests essentially on the relationship between just two lines. As another example, Cox, Rehg, and Hingorani <ref> [12] </ref> describe a system that uses a Bayesian approach to finding smooth curves based on ideas from target tracking. This method makes smoothness decisions based on the recent history of 4 a curve. Huttenlocher and Wayner [23] also use local relationships in forming convex groups.

Reference-contexts: Third, Shashua and Ullman's system does not explicitly take account of the gap between the beginning and end of a curve, as our system does. There is some evidence that such gaps are of considerable psychological significance (Elder and Zucker <ref> [15] </ref>, Kovacs and Julesz [33]). Perhaps the most significant difference, however, is that Shashua and Ullman's system is designed to find the most perceptually salient contour, which initially attracts our attention. <p> It has also not been demonstrated that Gestalt principles can explain all aspects of human perceptual organization. Jacobs [25] shows some examples of grouping performance that appear due to convexity, although this possibility has not been explored in the psychology literature, and is only suggestive. Elder and Zucker <ref> [15] </ref> and Kovacs and Julesz [33] provide evidence that closure plays a significant role in human perceptual organization. 6 A number of object recognition systems have in practice relied on finding convex groups of edges in images.

Reference-contexts: There is in fact no reason why a solution to the figure-ground problem should be derivable from a single underlying theory. Marr recommended focusing on problems that have a "clean underlying theory", instead. These more manageable problems included shape-from-shading, edge detection, and object representation. More recently, Huang <ref> [22] </ref> has stated: Everyone in computer vision knows that segmentation is of the utmost importance. We do not see many results published not because we do not work on it but because it is such a difficult problem that it is hard to get any good results worthy of publication.

Huttenlocher and Wayner [23] also consider other criteria for deciding which line is best added to a group. However, the above general description of the greedy algorithm will suffice for our analysis, and provides a reasonable example of a greedy convex grouping algorithm. <p> As our analysis shows, the likelihood of two lines appearing convex varies linearly with the angle between them. Therefore, random lines will be less likely to produce groups with smaller changes in the angles of adjacent lines. A similar grouping heuristic is used by Huttenlocher and Wayner <ref> [23] </ref>. Our system could be modified to adopt this approach, and our analysis could be modified to consider the impact of such an approach on run time and output size. 8 Conclusions Convexity is just one potential grouping clue, but it is an important one to understand thoroughly.

And related grouping methods based on convexity have been widely used in various approaches to recognition. But convexity has usually been handled in ad-hoc ways that are sensitive to local perturbations of the image.

Reference-contexts: Because these types of clues are probabilistic, one expects to achieve better performance by combining many clues together, and this seems to be the experience of many researchers (Lowe [34], Jacobs <ref> [25] </ref>, Shashua and Ullman [46], Denasi et al.[13], Sarkar and Boyer [43], Mohan and Nevatia [38], Williams [49], and Nitzburg and Mumford [39]).

Reference-contexts: This indexing phase, which matches groups of 2-D image points to geometrically consistent 3-D model points is also described in <ref> [26] </ref>. We then explore the matches hypothesized by indexing, beginning with those generated by pairs of image groups that matched the fewest pairs of model groups. A verification step uses matches between 2-D points and 3-D points to determine a hypothetical location of a model in the image.

Reference-contexts: This is equivalent to stating that L 1;i We prune all unacceptable sequences reached in our search. It is not hard to see that enforcing these constraints will not eliminate any correct groups, while guaranteeing that the search produces only correct groups. We prove this in <ref> [27] </ref>. To further reduce the run time of our algorithm we notice that some values are re-used many times in the course of such a search, so we precompute these results and save them in tables. <p> 1 = M k 0 : We may then show that: g (s i ) = s i r i 2s i i dr i wedges show where l 21 must lie in order to satisfy the distance and convexity constraints. and Z r i+1 g (s i ) (see <ref> [27] </ref> for details). In fact, this integral is a bit of a simplification, because in deriving it we do not take account of the fact that r i may never be bigger than R. <p> This expression shows that asymptotically, the expected amount of work is exponential in n. To predict at what point the computation will become unmanageable, we compute the expected amount of work for a variety of realistic situations (further details of the computation are given in <ref> [27] </ref>). We do not prove that the summation of E i X i converges, but we find in practice that the terms become tiny for high values of i. Table 1 shows the expected work of the system as n and k vary. <p> We now present some examples of the system's performance on real images. In particular, we have integrated our grouping system into a complete recognition system, to demonstrate its potential value. Our system, described in detail in <ref> [27] </ref>, first forms convex groups, as we have described here. Additionally, it only uses a group if none of its oriented line segments appear in a more salient convex group. This prevents us from having to consider several, similar groups. <p> For example, in the fourth set of groups shown in Figure 7, we can see that a strong group from the face of the telephone includes an external edge from the rim of an occluding coffee mug. These groups, however, do enable our system to efficiently recognize objects. Although <ref> [27] </ref> details the performance of the system, Figure 10 shows two samples of our results. Pairs of groups of points from the telephone have been represented in the indexing table ahead of time. The figure shows that the system correctly locates the telephone. <p> We can see from these examples that grouping produces a relatively small set of convex groups, some of which lead to correct recognition of the object sought. See <ref> [27] </ref> for further details on the overall efficiency of the recognition system, using grouping. 25 groups that have a salience fraction of at least :75, and that consist entirely of oriented line segments that do not appear in more salient convex groups.

Reference-contexts: They show how this approach can explain a number of well-known Gestalt grouping phenomena, including grouping due to symmetry, parallelism, smooth continuation, and proximity (see Kohler <ref> [32] </ref> for a discussion of the Gestalt work). Lowe in particular has contributed to this approach by showing how to derive probability distributions that reflect the strength of grouping clues. Lowe, for example, shows that parallel image lines are relatively likely to come from a single object.

Reference-contexts: Third, Shashua and Ullman's system does not explicitly take account of the gap between the beginning and end of a curve, as our system does. There is some evidence that such gaps are of considerable psychological significance (Elder and Zucker [15], Kovacs and Julesz <ref> [33] </ref>). Perhaps the most significant difference, however, is that Shashua and Ullman's system is designed to find the most perceptually salient contour, which initially attracts our attention. <p> Jacobs [25] shows some examples of grouping performance that appear due to convexity, although this possibility has not been explored in the psychology literature, and is only suggestive. Elder and Zucker [15] and Kovacs and Julesz <ref> [33] </ref> provide evidence that closure plays a significant role in human perceptual organization. 6 A number of object recognition systems have in practice relied on finding convex groups of edges in images. Kalvin et al.[30] describes a 2-D recognition system that indexed into a library of objects.

For example, trapezoids are found that have nearby endpoints.

First, we consider Lowe's approach to grouping parallel lines. Lowe <ref> [35] </ref> measures the salience of parallel lines by considering the amount of separation between them, and the extent to which their angle deviates from perfect parallelism. Lowe suggests considering those pairs of lines first whose degree of salience and parallelism is least likely to occur at random.

Reference-contexts: Groups of features contain a good deal more information than individual features; we can use this information to determine correct matches efficiently. It has long been recognized, however, that grouping is a difficult problem, which perhaps explains its relative neglect. Marr <ref> [37] </ref> said: The figure-ground "problem" may not be a single problem, being instead a mixture of several subproblems which combine to achieve figural separation, just as the different molecular interactions combine to cause a protein to fold.
