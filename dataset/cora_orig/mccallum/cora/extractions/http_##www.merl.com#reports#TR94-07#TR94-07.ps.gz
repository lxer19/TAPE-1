Abstract: Stochastic approaches to natural language processing have often been preferred to rule-based approaches because of their robustness and their automatic training capabilities. This was the case for part-of-speech tagging until Brill showed how state-of-the-art part-of-speech tagging can be achieved with a rule-based tagger by inferring rules from a training corpus. However, current implementations of the rule-based tagger run more slowly than previous approaches. In this paper, we present a finite-state tagger inspired by the rule-based tagger which operates in optimal time in the sense that the time to assign tags to a sentence corresponds to the time required to follow a single path in a deterministic finite-state machine. This result is achieved by encoding the application of the rules found in the tagger as a non-deterministic finite-state transducer and then turning it into a deterministic transducer. The resulting deterministic transducer yields a part-of-speech tagger whose speed is dominated by the access time of mass storage devices. We then generalize the techniques to the class of transformation-based systems. This work may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part for any commercial purpose.

Reference-contexts: However, in the case of the part-of-speech tagger, the transducer is nearly minimal. 9.2 Proof of Correctness Although it is decidable whether a function is subsequential or not <ref> (Choffrut, 1977) </ref>, the determinization algorithm described in the previous section does not terminate when run on a non-subsequential function. Two issues are addressed in this section. First, the proof of soundness: the fact that if the algorithm terminates, then the output transducer is deterministic and represents the same function.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Finite-state devices have important applications to many areas of computer science, including pattern matching, databases and compiler technology. Although their linguistic adequacy to natural language processing has been questioned in the past <ref> (Chomsky, 1964) </ref>, there has recently been a dramatic renewal of interest in the application of finite-state devices to several aspects of natural language processing. This renewal of interest is due to the speed and the compactness of finite-state representations.

Reference-contexts: For instance, consider T 3 of Figure 15. It 9 A sequential transducer is a deterministic transducer for which all states are final. Sequential transducers are also called generalized sequential machines <ref> (Eilenberg, 1974) </ref>. MERL-TR-94-07.

Reference-contexts: Such representations have been successfully applied to different aspects of natural language processing, such as morphological analysis and generation (Karttunen, Kaplan, and Zaenen, 1992; Clemenceau, 1993), parsing (Roche, 1993; Tapanainen and Voutilainen, 1993), phonology (Laporte, 1993; Kaplan and Kay, 1994) and speech recognition <ref> (Pereira, Riley, and Sproat, 1994) </ref>. Although finite-state machines have been used for part-of-speech tagging (Tapanainen and Voutilainen, 1993; Silberztein, 1993), none of these approaches has the same flexibility as stochastic techniques.

Reference-contexts: To achieve high speed for this procedure, the dictionary is represented by a deterministic finite-state automaton with both low access time and small storage space. Suppose one wants to encode the sample dictionary of Figure 9. The algorithm, as described in <ref> (Revuz, 1991) </ref>, consists of first building a tree whose branches are labeled by letters and whose leaves are labeled by a list of tags (such as nn vb) , and then minimizing it into a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
