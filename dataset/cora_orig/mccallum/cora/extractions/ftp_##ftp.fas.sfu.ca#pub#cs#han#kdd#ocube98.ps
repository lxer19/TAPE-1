Abstract: Data mining is the discovery of knowledge and useful information from the large amounts of data stored in databases. With the increasing popularity of object-oriented database systems in advanced database applications, it is important to study the data mining methods for object-oriented databases because mining knowledge from such databases may improve understanding, organization, and utilization of the data stored there. In this paper, issues on generalization-based data mining in object-oriented databases are investigated in three aspects: (1) generalization of complex objects, (2) class-based generalization, and (3) extraction of different kinds of rules. An object cube model is proposed for class-based generalization, on-line analytical processing, and data mining. The study shows that (i) a set of sophisticated generalization operators can be constructed for generalization of complex data objects, (ii) a dimension-based class generalization mechanism can be developed for object cube construction, and (iii) sophisticated rule formation methods can be developed for extraction of different kinds of knowledge from data, including characteristic rules, discriminant rules, association rules, and classification rules. Furthermore, the application of such discovered knowledge may substantially enhance the power and flexibility of browsing database, organizing database, and querying data and knowledge in object-oriented databases. fl This research was supported in part by the following: for the first author, the grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and NCE/IRIS; for the second author, the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture of Japan under Scientific Research Grant-in-Aid, for the first three authors, the Research Grant-in-Aid from the Artificial Intelligence Research Promotion Foundation, Japan, and for the third author, a scholarship from the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of Japan and the work was done during his visit to Simon Fraser University.

Reference-contexts: For example, "age" is a method which computes the age of a Person from the attribute Birthdate and the current date.

Reference-contexts: Methods for mining these kinds of rules are briefly outlined in this subsection. A data evolution rule <ref> [53, 2] </ref> reflects the general evolution (or changing) behavior of a set of data, e.g., the rule which describes the major factors which influence the fluctuations of certain stock values. The discovery of data evolution regularities is to mine the general characteristics of the set of data changing with time. <p> To perform the second task, similarity measurements should be defined and applied <ref> [2] </ref>, which may specify to what extent the different data may still be considered as similar but to what extent it should be categorized as deviations. Fuzzy logics or uncertainty measurements may be associated with the deviated data to quantitatively characterize the behaviors of the data deviations.

Reference-contexts: Without concept generalization, discovered knowledge is expressed in terms of low-level data (data stored in the databases), often in the form of functional dependencies, low-level association rules <ref> [4] </ref>, or low-level integrity constraints. On the other hand, with concept generalization, discovered knowledge can be expressed in terms of concise, expressive and higher level abstraction, in the form of generalized rules or generalized constraints, and be associated with statistical information. <p> Notice that the two numbers enclosed in the square brackets in the form of "[support, confidence]" are two important parameters to measure the significance of the rule <ref> [4] </ref>. The first parameter, support of a pattern p in a set S, denoted as (p=S), is the probability that a pattern p appears in set S, i.e., the number of the tuples in S which contain p versus the total number of tuples in S. <p> Mining association rules in transaction databases has been studied extensively in recent database research, with several interesting algorithms developed for mining single- or multiple- level association rules in such databases <ref> [4, 22 35, 53, 27] </ref>. A similar association rule mining algorithm can be developed to adapt such rule mining technique in object-oriented databases. <p> The mining of multiple-level or primitive level association rules is a costly process because of the very large possibilities to group the large set of data items into different sized groups <ref> [4, 53, 27] </ref>. However, people may sometimes be only interested in the association relationships among the data at high concept levels. <p> whose support passes the support threshold test, i.e., if (A 1 = a 1 ):count fi kDBk, then L 1 = L 1 [ (A 1 = a 1 ). (b) Iteratively compute the large k-itemsets L k (for k &gt; 1) based on the idea of the Apriori algorithm <ref> [4] </ref>. The k-th iteration is described as follows. Generate the candidate large k-itemsets by Apriori: first forming a k-item using two neighboring (k 1)- items in L k1 and then testing whether all of its (k 1)-item subset is in L k1 . <p> Steps 1 and 2 are verified in the generalization algorithm. Step 3 is essentially the Apriori association rule computation algorithm whose correctness has been shown in <ref> [4] </ref>. Notice the major difference of the computation at this step is that the support (i.e., count) of a pattern is computed using the data not in the initial working class but in the prime class. This involves much less database accesses than computing at the primitive concept level. <p> This involves much less database accesses than computing at the primitive concept level. Step 4 generates all the rules after passing the confidence testing, which is similar to <ref> [4] </ref>. Therefore, all the association rules at the concept level of the prime class is generated, which reflects the association relationships at the prime class concept level for the relevant set of data in the database. 2 The following example illustrates the association rule derivation process.

Reference-contexts: Then we study the class generalization in object cube model. A popular conceptual model that influence the design of data warehouses and development of query engines and front-end tools for on-line analytical processing (OLAP) is the multidimensional model of data in the data warehouse <ref> [12, 23] </ref>. A multidimensional database, also popularly called data cube, is a database consisting of a huge set of facts (also called measures) or multidimensional points and a relatively small set of dimensions with respect to which data is analyzed. <p> This process leads to the construction of an object cube containing a rich set of dimensions and measures. Since an object cube is a multidimensional database containing a set of dimensions and measures, it can be modeled by the star, snowflake, and fact constellation models <ref> [12] </ref> as that in relational multidimensional databases. Based on the above discussion, the computation of an object cube can be performed as follows.

Different from most learning-from-examples algorithms <ref> [38, 22] </ref> which partition the set of examples into positive and negative sets and perform generalization using the positive data and specialization using the negative ones [38], a database usually does not explicitly store negative data, and thus no explicitly specified negative examples can be used for specialization.

Notice that in the following discussion, an attribute of a class may also represent that resulted from the application of a class-associated method. <p> The task can be represented in the following query <ref> [24] </ref> in the syntax of OML. generalize Person P into Generalized P where P.Age &gt;= 40 and P.Car.Maker = `Japan' and `Ph.D' in P.Education and P.Workplace.Name = `U.B.C.' in relevance to P.Name, P.Home.House size, P.Salary, P.Home.Address Following Algorithm 4.1, the class generalization request can be processed as shown below. <p> Thus it is often preferable to associate quantitative information with a rule or with the tuples in a generalized class to indicate how precisely a property can be used to distinguish a target class from others. Such a quantitative measurement, called discriminating weight <ref> [24] </ref>, can be defined as the ratio of the frequency that a property occurring in the target class versus that occurring in both target and contrasting classes. Formally, the discriminating-weight, or briefly d-weight, is defined as follows.

Second, generalization is performed on the set of retrieved data, which corresponds to the generalization of complex data objects, for which a set of generalization operators should be developed.

Reference-contexts: Mining association rules in transaction databases has been studied extensively in recent database research, with several interesting algorithms developed for mining single- or multiple- level association rules in such databases <ref> [4, 22 35, 53, 27] </ref>. A similar association rule mining algorithm can be developed to adapt such rule mining technique in object-oriented databases. <p> The mining of multiple-level or primitive level association rules is a costly process because of the very large possibilities to group the large set of data items into different sized groups <ref> [4, 53, 27] </ref>. However, people may sometimes be only interested in the association relationships among the data at high concept levels. <p> Methods for mining these kinds of rules are briefly outlined in this subsection. A data evolution rule <ref> [53, 2] </ref> reflects the general evolution (or changing) behavior of a set of data, e.g., the rule which describes the major factors which influence the fluctuations of certain stock values. The discovery of data evolution regularities is to mine the general characteristics of the set of data changing with time.

Reference-contexts: Recent studies on data mining by clustering techniques [42, 15] have addressed this problem, and some relatively efficient methods, such as CLARANS [42], R*-tree-based classification [15], and BIRCH algorithm <ref> [55] </ref> seem to be in the promising direction. Based on our observation, similar techniques can be applied to object clustering in object-oriented databases as well.

Reference-contexts: The aggregate layers of the cuboid can be computed efficiently using a typical cube construction algorithm, such as <ref> [56] </ref>. 3. <p> Proof sketch. Let m 0 be the number of dimensions in the initial working class W 0 . Step 2 scans n objects in W 0 usually only once but occasionally a small number of times in the base cuboid computation (see <ref> [56] </ref>). Thus the complexity in the computation using a compressed cube structure is O (n). Step 3 decides the level to be generalized by scanning the dimensions only which is linear to the size of dimension only. <p> Taking a group of hierarchical attributes as one dimension and count, sum, etc. as measures, construct the base cuboid Cube 0 . The compute the cube aggregation layers using a typical cube construction algorithm, such as <ref> [56] </ref>. Step 3. In PreGen, each dimension of the base cuboid Cube 0 is scanned once. The distributions of the dimension values are computed with the generalization mapping pairs determined.

Reference-contexts: Since there could be many relevant attributes in a data mining task, the selection of attributes to be reduced or further generalized is crucial to the interestingness of the generalized rules or generated crosstabs. 18 Previous studies on machine learning [39], statistics, fuzzy and rough set theories <ref> [57] </ref>, etc. have developed many techniques at the evaluation of the importance of different sets of attributes and projection on the appropriate ones. <p> The construction of a multi-resolution model for OODBs [50], which may help browse OODB contents and answer interesting queries at high concept levels is another interesting topic for further study. Furthermore, integration of dimension-based induction with other data mining methods <ref> [1, 14, 34, 40, 47, 52, 54, 57] </ref> for mining various kinds of knowledge from object-oriented databases is another important direction in the future.

Reference-contexts: In Section 6, other methods for mining in object-oriented databases and the applications of discovered knowledge are discussed, and the study is summarized in Section 7. 2 Primitives for knowledge discovery in object-oriented databases There are different philosophical considerations on knowledge discovery in databases <ref> [21, 20, 58] </ref>, which may lead to different methodologies in the development of knowledge discovery techniques. To simplify our discussion, an evolutionary approach is adopted, that is, starting from simple assumptions and relaxing them step-by-step to handle more complicated cases. <p> Assumption 2.1 An object-oriented database stores a large amount of relatively reliable and stable data. Data in an object-oriented database may be incomplete, redundant, incorrect, or highly dynamic in certain applications <ref> [58] </ref>, which makes knowledge discovery a challenging task. The assumption on data stability and reliability facilitates first developing knowledge discovery mechanisms in relatively simple environments and then evolving the techniques step-by-step towards more complicated situations. Assumption 2.2 A knowledge discovery process is initiated by a user's knowledge discovery query. <p> Following different paths corresponds to the way in which different people may mine differently from the same set of examples. The generalized classes can be examined by users or experts interactively to filter out trivial rules and preserve interesting ones <ref> [58] </ref>. A graphical user interface may help users try different alternatives interactively in the process of mining desired results. 5.2 Extraction of discriminant rules A discriminant rule is an assertion which discriminates concepts of the class being examined (the target class) from other classes (called contrasting classes).
