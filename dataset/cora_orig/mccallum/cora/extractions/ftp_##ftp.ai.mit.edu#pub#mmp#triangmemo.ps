Abstract: When triangulating a belief network we aim to obtain a junction tree of minimumstate space. According to [8], searching for the optimal triangulation can be cast as a search over all the permutations of the network's variables. Our approach is to embed the discrete set of permutations in a convex continuous domain D. By suitably extending the cost function over D and solving the continous nonlinear optimization task we hope to obtain a good triangulation with respect to the aformentioned cost. In this paper we introduce an upper bound to the total junction tree weight as the cost function. The appropriatedness of this choice is discussed and explored by simulations. Then we present two ways of embedding the new objective function into continuous domains and show that they perform well compared to the best known heuristic. This report describes research done at the Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, the Dept. of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, the Center for Biological and Computational Learning and the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Reference-contexts: But we expect that with the increase of r v and of the graph density the cost of the largest clique will tend to dominate J fl improving the agreement between the two criteria. Optimizing J C is provably NP-hard <ref> [1] </ref>. Now back to J . A reason to use it instead of J fl in our algorithm is that the former is easier to compute and to approximate. <p> In the following, the set of permutations will be embedded in a continuous domain.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction. What is triangulation ? Belief networks are graphical representations of probability distributions over a set of variables. For an introductory, yet rigorous treatment of graphical probability models, the reader is refered to <ref> [5] </ref>. In what follows it will be always assumed that the variables take values in a finite set and that they correspond to the vertices of a graph. The graph's arcs represent the dependencies among variables.

Reference-contexts: Even if most of the local minima found by lexicographic search were good enough (something that is not supported by practical experience <ref> [6] </ref>), the problem with this algorithm is that it takes into account only topological information, ignoring the values of r v .

Reference-contexts: If a graph is not triangulated it is always possible to add new edges so that the resulting graph is triangulated. We shall call this procedure triangulation and the added edges the fill-in.

Reference-contexts: It is therefore critical that the triangulation procedure produces a graph that is optimal or at least "good" in this respect. Unfortunately, this is a hard problem. No optimal triangulation algorithm is known to date. However, a nonoptimal triangulation is readily obtained; a simple algorithm is Rose's elimination procedure <ref> [8] </ref> which chooses a node v of the graph, connects all its neighbors to form a clique, then eliminates v and the edges incident to it and proceeds recursively. The resulting filled-in graph is triangulated. <p> There exists a method, the lexicographic search [9], that finds minimal triangulations with respect to J F , but finding the minimum one is NP-hard [10]. It can be proven <ref> [8] </ref> that for a constant number of values r v per node, the minimal triangulations with respect to J F are also local minima for J fl and J .
