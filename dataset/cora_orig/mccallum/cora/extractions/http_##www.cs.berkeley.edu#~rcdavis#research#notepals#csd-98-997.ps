Abstract: NotePals is an ink-based, collaborative note taking application that runs on personal digital assistants (PDAs). Meeting participants write notes in their own handwriting on a PDA. These notes are shared with other participants by synchronizing later with a shared note repository. NotePals is distinguished by its lightweight process, interface, and hardware. This paper describes the design and implementation of NotePals, its web-based note repository, and the results of an informal user study. The results indicate that taking notes on NotePals produces minutes that are comparable to paper in terms of speed and legibility, and the notes are far easier to share with others.

Reference-contexts: Another approach would be to upload documents such as presentations or agendas to both the web repository and the Pilot, allowing users to annotate them. Other researchers have found that students find some value in electronic notes that are taken on top of a copy of the presenters material <ref> [1] </ref>. CONCLUSIONS NotePals offers a lightweight, inexpensive way for people to walk away from a meeting with shared captured information. The shared notes generated by groups using NotePals overcome many of the problems with traditional meeting notes such as uneven note taking responsibility and limited points of view.

Reference-contexts: For example, colleagues have reported attending meetings with nontechnical coworkers where over half of the participants used Pilots [9]. International Data Corp. estimates that manufacturers will ship 5.5 million handheld computers worldwide this year and 16.2 million units per year by 2001 <ref> [2, 22] </ref>. The Pilot is one of the most popular machines in the PDA market. Its popularity seems to be driven by its small size, low price, and easy synchronization with desktop applications [3]. These same factors were important in our decision to use the Pilot as our platform.

Reference-contexts: The Pilot is one of the most popular machines in the PDA market. Its popularity seems to be driven by its small size, low price, and easy synchronization with desktop applications <ref> [3] </ref>. These same factors were important in our decision to use the Pilot as our platform. Its size and price vastly improve the odds that meeting attendees will have one with them whenever and wherever a meeting takes place. In addition, its synchronization model is simple.

Reference-contexts: In either case, a single perspective does not suffice. Also, the distribution of the notes can be problematic. On the other extreme, high-tech meeting capture systems <ref> [20, 16, 4] </ref> require expensive, specially equipped rooms that often require a facilitator to operate. These rooms are not ubiquitous and thus violate the need to have meetings anywhere, anytime. In addition, the technology often impedes the normal interaction between participants [14]. <p> Unlike the Arizona tools, these tools support unstructured, sketch-based interfaces. Although NotePals is fairly limited compared to many of these systems, it was influenced by there informal interfaces. Again, NotePals attacks the fundamental problems of these systems: cost and ubiquity. Meeting rooms equipped with LiveBoards <ref> [4] </ref> and other special equipment are expensive and do not support our goal of allowing meetings to occur whenever, wherever. NotePals has some similarities to Wangs Freestyle [11], which allowed users to share ink-based annotations of documents on the desktop. Unlike NotePals, Freestyle does not automatically organize notes.

Reference-contexts: The note taking process allows each participant in a meeting to take his or her own notes in freeform ink. NotePals automatically creates minutes by merging the notes after the meeting, eliminating the need for a scribe. The NotePals ink-based user interface uses a focus plus context <ref> [5] </ref> view that attempts to overcome problems associated with the small size of PDAs (see Figure 2a). This allows users to take notes quickly using their own handwriting without relying on error-prone handwriting recognizers or unfamiliar shorthands [6, 13].

This allows users to take notes quickly using their own handwriting without relying on error-prone handwriting recognizers or unfamiliar shorthands <ref> [6, 13] </ref>. The drive to create NotePals came from the realization that people often leave meetings without a shared understanding or a record of the important points that occurred. Assigning a scribe to record the minutes is one solution, but it is onerous and sometimes produces a biased record.

Reference-contexts: The web-based notes repository allows viewing and filtering of the notes in several different ways. This is important because meetings are ad-hoc and systems that impose an explicit meeting process will be rejected <ref> [7] </ref>. NotePals can also be used in classroom settings. Students at U.C. Berkeley can purchase notes taken by paid note takers for many large courses, but these are not available in smaller classes. With NotePals, students in any class could get notes created by their peers.

Reference-contexts: NotePals also has similarities to existing commercial note taking applications. In particular, a cursor is used to allow entry of ink-based notes in both the Newton note taking application and in aha! InkWriter <ref> [8] </ref>. The Newton can reduce the text at the insertion point by either 50% or 75%. Both applications automatically fill text that reaches the edge of the page, as in a traditional word processor. The Vmacs system [10] takes a radically different approach from NotePals.

Reference-contexts: NotePals is a collaborative note taking tool that lets people walk away from any meeting, presentation, or class with a low-overhead record of what transpired. Previous research in this area, a survey of PDA users <ref> [12] </ref>, and interviews with potential NotePals users led us to a (a) (b) focus area active and (b) note attributes area active. - 2 - simple design idea. Meeting participants use NotePals on PDAs for taking notes during a meeting. <p> A major problem is the accurate reporting of meeting results when the scribe is not well versed in all the topics [15]. A survey of 142 PDA users <ref> [12] </ref> found that note taking was the most popular application of Apple Newton users (of six applications), but was far less popular with Pilot users (ranked fourth of six).

Reference-contexts: Perhaps the note repository should be organized more like a web-based discussion group so that differences can be resolved online. After uploading to the repository, more CPU-intensive algorithms could be run. We have considered adding a ink-based search mechanism <ref> [19] </ref> or possibly combining offline handwriting recognition with a clustering algorithm to extract or group related notes. These issues need to be examined further. Another interesting area to explore with NotePals is synchronization with other media such as typed meeting agendas, presentation slides, or audio.
