Abstract: Because of the distance between the skull and brain and their different resistivities, electroencephalographic (EEG) data collected from any point on the human scalp includes activity generated within a large brain area. This spatial smearing of EEG data by volume conduction does not involve significant time delays, however, suggesting that the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm of Bell and Sejnowski [1] is suitable for performing blind source separation on EEG data. The ICA algorithm separates the problem of source identification from that of source localization. First results of applying the ICA algorithm to EEG and event-related potential (ERP) data collected during a sustained auditory detection task show: (1) ICA training is insensitive to different random seeds. (2) ICA may be used to segregate obvious artifactual EEG components (line and muscle noise, eye movements) from other sources. (3) ICA is capable of isolating overlapping EEG phenomena, including alpha and theta bursts and spatially-separable ERP components, to separate ICA channels. (4) Nonstationarities in EEG and behavioral state can be tracked using ICA via changes in the amount of residual correlation between ICA-filtered output channels.

Reference-contexts: Recent efforts to identify EEG sources have focused mostly on performing spatial segregation and localization of source activity [4]. By applying the ICA algorithm of Bell and Sejnowski <ref> [1] </ref>, we attempt to completely separate the twin problems of source identification (What) and source localization (Where).

In <ref> [1] </ref>, a new algorithm was proposed for carrying out ICA. The only prior assumption is that the unknown independent components, u i , each have the same form of cumulative density function (c.d.f.) after scaling and shifting, and that we know this form, call it F u (u).

Reference-contexts: These results were obtained despite the fact that the p.d.f. of the speech signals was not exactly matched by the gradient of the logistic function. In the experiments in this paper, we also used the speedup technique of prewhitening described in <ref> [2] </ref>. 1.3 Applying ICA to EEG Data The ICA technique appears ideally suited for performing source separation in domains where, (1) the sources are independent, (2) the propagation delays of the `mixing medium' are negligible, (3) the sources are analog and have p.d.f.'s not too unlike the gradient of a logistic

Reference-contexts: Although the ICA model of the EEG ignores the known variable synchronization of separate EEG generators by common subcortical or corticocortical influences <ref> [5] </ref>, it appears promising for identifying concurrent signal sources that are either situated too close together, or are too widely distributed to be separated by current localization techniques.

Reference-contexts: ICA spatial filtering produces two channels (S [1-2]) separating out the 39-Hz steady-state response (SSR) produced by the continuous 39-Hz click stimulation during the session. Note the stimulus-induced perturbation in SSR amplitude previously identified in <ref> [6] </ref>. Three channels (H [1-3]) pass time-limited components of the detected target response, while four others (L [1-4]) components of the (larger) undetected target response.
