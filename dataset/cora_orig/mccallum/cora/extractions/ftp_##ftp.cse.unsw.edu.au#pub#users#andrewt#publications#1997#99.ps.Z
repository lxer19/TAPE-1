Title: Rational and Affective Linking Across Conceptual Cases without Rules

Abstract: Human reasoning across experiential cases in episodic memory seems quite different from conventional artificial reasoning with conceptual representations by systematically manipulating them according to logical rules. One difference is that in humans linkages between particular experiences can apparently be made in a number of qualitatively different ways, forming recollective chains along different dimensions. For example, watching one movie may recall another which had a similar ending, cinematography, or common actors. It may also recall an otherwise unrelated movie which produced the same emotional response. These linkages do not appear to be economically or simply described by rules. Yet case-based reasoning systems could benefit from sequential indexing of this kind. A conceptual-graph-based FGP machine using a small database of intellectual property law cases could show how such memory-walks may be computed without rules.

Reference-contexts: The chief problem appears not to be that of providing a useful ontology - the legal profession already has established indexes of specialised terms from which conceptual hierarchies may be derived <ref> [1] </ref>. Rather, it is the complexity and open-textual nature of the content of the briefs. These often presuppose a great deal of commonsense knowlege as well as a specialised knowledge of the law.

Reference-contexts: A faster version of the conceptual parser used by BEELINE [12], could be used to accept case inputs in natural language, while a generator such as <ref> [2] </ref> could describe cases and keep the user informed about the state of the machine, its simulated speculation and any conclusions reached. Both components depend on considerable amounts of hand-encoded knowledge - enough to force the project toward the creation of automatic or semiautomatic knowledge tools.

Reference-contexts: concepts in the two graphs of the distances on the type hierarchy between each concept's type and the most specific type which subsumes them both (minimal common generalisation) [8] - into a measure which exhibits more of the charactersitics of human similarity judgements, such as salience, context and perceiver effects <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: imagine techniques which find the correct correspondences for longitudinal coalescence across multi-graph contexts, the problem is formidable, and when taken together with the other problems this causes, a good case emerges for requiring contexts to be standardised (or normalised) single graphs, even if that reduces expressivity. (Dick's example cases in <ref> [4] </ref> are written this way). With that constraint the problem simplifies to the extraction of high-frequency or weighty features and the elimination of contradictory features. These features would then be instantiated into a template for this context's standard graph form.

Reference-contexts: To ratify the theory, a data-driven algorithm, called the FGP (fetch, generalise, project) machine, was written. It can find high-focus relationships between cases <ref> [7] </ref>. In one experiment, the machine is tested on a series of room descriptions encoded as simple attribute pairs (e.g. ((oven yes) (computer no) (coffee-machine yes) (sink yes) (sofa no)). <p> Various experimental variations on the above basic principle are possible. For example, the global variable which represents Gelerter's degree of focus can be made to influence the behaviour of the functions in different ways. Tests of the FGP machine on two databases <ref> [7] </ref> show a predictive or diagnostic performance level close to or better than human domain experts in the same task (65% vs. a human expert's 53% correct predictions of the nationality of folkdances from a database of descriptive features, and 70% vs a medical specialist's 60% correct differential diagnoses from descriptions <p> This means how strongly and clearly T brings to mind a value for the query. Fertig & Gelernter <ref> [7] </ref> use an information-theoretic formula in which the information gain (negative entropy) on the query from T is defined as: ln N + ( ) ln T T where N is the total number of possible values for the goal in M n i is the number of times goal value

Reference-contexts: begin with the work of others to refine the orthodox index of semantic distance between conceptual graphs - the sum over corresponding concepts in the two graphs of the distances on the type hierarchy between each concept's type and the most specific type which subsumes them both (minimal common generalisation) <ref> [8] </ref> - into a measure which exhibits more of the charactersitics of human similarity judgements, such as salience, context and perceiver effects [3].

Reference-contexts: Indexing or reminding has been a recurring topic in memory-oriented views of conceptual processing [10]. More recently, Gelernter has articulated a theory of musing to account for the memory walk phenomenon <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> These could be used to perform a different kind of low-focus linking. In affect, the machine could speculate about situations which had the same emotional connotations, finding commonalities across its entire experience with happy, sad or funny situations. In Gelernter's hypothetical dialogues about such linking <ref> [9, p.145-146] </ref>, a low-focussed FGP machine recognises the displeased state of a user, is reminded of a literary character by the plaintiff of a legal case study, and refuses to obey a request for financial help because the subject matter is boring! The point of this is to imagine how affective

Reference-contexts: The mechanisms by which one experiential pattern may summon another, somehow similar pattern has also been of interest in since the origins of case-based reasoning (CBR) in the late 70s. Indexing or reminding has been a recurring topic in memory-oriented views of conceptual processing <ref> [10] </ref>. More recently, Gelernter has articulated a theory of musing to account for the memory walk phenomenon [9].

Reference-contexts: The final stage of this work should be to bring the machines interaction with the user alive by adding a natural language, thus substantiating Gelernters dream. A faster version of the conceptual parser used by BEELINE <ref> [12] </ref>, could be used to accept case inputs in natural language, while a generator such as [2] could describe cases and keep the user informed about the state of the machine, its simulated speculation and any conclusions reached.

Reference-contexts: Better opportunities to find commonalities across cases could be had if their graphs were entered into the database in standard forms. This would, however, create an additional expressive constraint, making the already difficult acquisition task harder. Mineau <ref> [13] </ref> has suggested that excess variability in graphs - a range of ontological choices and structural compositions beyond that which is strictly necessary to encode different meanings - might be reduced by automatically normalising the graphs.

Reference-contexts: Within each context was nested a set of conceptual graphs or subcontexts, encoding the facts, events, or acts pertinent to this context, expressed in a rich semantics combining Somers case grid and Sowas methods for situations <ref> [14] </ref>. This method covers the dispute which motivates the legal action, but, from a CBR point of view, needs to be extended to cover the resolution of the dispute (findings, judgements, dismissal) and its final outcome (penalties, appeals, settlements).

Reference-contexts: This could be difficult to create, and the resultant reactions are not guaranteed to be humanly recognisable, but it requires no extra effort at input. Tepfenhart has pointed to the advantages of explicitly represented attitudes for problem solving, and has suggested practical methods for representing and computing with them <ref> [15] </ref>. The reader might wonder what justifies any effort at including affective states at all.

Reference-contexts: Legal information is notoriously difficult to represent, but fortunately the exact semantics used to encode the cases is not crucial to the operation of the CG-FGP machine. Good efforts to represent complex legal information using conceptual graphs have been described by Dick [4,5]. Dick adapted Toulmins <ref> [16] </ref> six-aspect model of argument representation, composing a schema from a set of distinct contexts for claim, grounds, reasons, backing, modalities and rebuttal.

Reference-contexts: Wuwongse and Niyomthai <ref> [17] </ref> have suggested that as concepts are not regarded as equally important in human intuitions of similarity, so the orthodox semantic distance (SD) sum should be influenced by importance values (IV) associated with the concepts: n i=1 Normally the salience term IV presents a problem, because it requires a number to
