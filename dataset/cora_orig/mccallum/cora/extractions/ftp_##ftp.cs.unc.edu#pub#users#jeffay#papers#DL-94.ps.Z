Abstract: The UNC CS Collaboratory, in conjunction with the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and the Office of the North Carolina Chief Medical Examiner, is constructing a digital library to augment the collaborative practice of forensic medicine. Called the Repository of Patterened Injury Data (RPID), the project is putting into digital form several important and heavily used collection of medical data, stored and presented to allow joint consultation by several pathologists. We are researching issues in data storage, retrieval, and delivery; in shared distributed user interfaces; and in collaborative work patterns for forensic medicine.

Reference-contexts: The user will then be presented with preliminary search results ( e.g., "your query matched 50 data objects") and will be able to accept, broaden, or narrow the query using the thesaurus hierarchy. And third, we can combine these techniques with relevance feedback <ref> [17,5, 8] </ref> allowing the user to formulate a free form query and then, after an initial search, have the system revise the query based on explicit or implicit user interaction and on the data objects that the user has judged relevant.

The basic data model for the World Wide Web (WWW) hypermedia facility is a graph with no central definition, and with nodes distributed very widely geographically. The graph is flat, in that no node itself contains a graph.

Reference-contexts: We propose to experiment with several strategies for automatic classification and retrieval with this portion of the database. Initially, we propose to classify textual material using a standard medical thesaurus with additional terms unique to forensic pathology added where necessary <ref> [15] </ref>. This will create for each text object a vector of keywords representing the content of that piece of text.

Reference-contexts: Each node is a "document component" containing names of links to other content elements (Uniform resource Locators, or URLs). WWW graphs tend to be exceptionally dynamic, with a nontrivial possibility of finding no nodes at the ends of some links. Hypersets (sets) <ref> [16] </ref>. The basic model underlying the Hypersets hypermedia system is defined in terms of mathematical set theory. At any point in browsing, a reader is presented with a set of nodes, all related by 7 sharing some characteristic ( e.g., all concerning injuries from dog bites).

Reference-contexts: Thus, the notion of "link" found in other models is served in Hypersets by set intersection.

Trellis is distinguished from other models by its use of Petri nets, a class of parallel automation, to define both the static and the dynamic structures of a hyperdocument.

Reference-contexts: Browsing proceeds as allowed by valid execution sequences of the net. Browsing may create and synchronize parallel paths of activity. The Trellis model has been shown to be effective for defining collaboration protocols within hyperdocuments <ref> [20] </ref>. These models have been extensively explored and reported on individually, but very little comparative research has been done among these models. The ABC hypermedia system is built on top of the DGS distributed graph server [25].
