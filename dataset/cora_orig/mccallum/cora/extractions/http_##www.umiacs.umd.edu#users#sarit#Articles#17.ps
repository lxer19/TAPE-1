Abstract: Formal real-time imagination is a term that may curiously describe the activities of a commonsense agent in a real-time setting in general, and in a tight deadline situation in particular. We briefly describe an `active-logic' mechanism that fits this description. Temporal projection is an essential component of real-time planning. We draw a parallel between imagination as we understand it in human context and the capacity of the automated agent to formulate mental images of possible scenarios and plans of action in the course of its reasoning. We outline a treatment of temporal issues of significance to a time-situated reasoning mechanism in a dynamic setting with deadlines. The Yale shooting problem is a benchmark problem in temporal reasoning. We demonstrate how the active-logic planning mechanism successfully handles some interesting real-time variants of the Yale shooting problem. The solutions to each of these illustrate the agent's ability to form contexts within which to reason, to project in each context thus formed by applying default inferences, and to revise and extend its conclusions within each context by applying time-sensitive inference rules, and most impor tantly, to account for all the time spent in the process.

Reference-contexts: These are indeed fanciful or empty assumptions (Def. 3b) that he must revise nonmonotonically in the face of evidence to the contrary. The underlying mechanism is a formal active logic <ref> [6, 24] </ref>. In this sense, Dudley's `active mind' can use its formal declarative machinery to take leaps of imagination and the term `formal real-time imagination' could aptly describe Dudley's behavior in real-time using active-logics. Temporal projection is an essential component of real-time planning. <p> Section 5 describes Dudley's real-time treatment of the qualification and ramification problems. Section 6 compares the active logic approach to other research in temporal reasoning. 2 One Step At a Time Step-logics <ref> [6] </ref> were introduced to model a common sense agent's ongoing process of reasoning in a changing world. A step-logic is characterized by a language, observations and inference rules. A step is defined as a fundamental unit of inference time.

Reference-contexts: The world does not change much here, a single model is updated to reflect the results of actions. Two other related frame issues have been well documented in the literature <ref> [9] </ref>: The qualification problem is the impossibility of accounting for an arbitrarily large number of potential (pre)conditions for an action and the ramification problem is the difficulty in reasoning about the extended effects of actions as time passes. <p> Once `Hinders' enters the context of 17 With suitable knowledge about the domain, our mechanism will also allow us to deal with actions in the self-defeating category <ref> [9] </ref>. However these problems involve the characterization of the applicable physical laws, and tend to become quite complex in any framework. plan p, Dudley must take the required replanning steps to remedy the situation.

We demonstrate here how this mechanism applies to several real-time variations of the Yale Shooting Problem <ref> [10] </ref> appropriate to active logics. The first is a witness scenario where Dudley is a witness to the scene of the crime. <p> Dudley is then draws the commonsense conclusion that Fred has been killed. Here we are mimicking Baker's simplified version of the YSP (no loading action <ref> [10] </ref> is required, and the wait action occurs between steps 0 and 4). Below we sketch the steps in this reasoning.

Reference-contexts: We have formulated a mechanism for fully real-time deadline coupled planning using active logics <ref> [13, 21] </ref>. Uncertainty, urgency and unknowns characterize the complex world of a commonsense agent. Dudley, our agent, is in a particularly tight setting with respect to deadlines. <p> Other aspects of the planner related to time estimates and feasibility analysis with respect to tight deadlines are described in <ref> [21] </ref>. We demonstrate here how this mechanism applies to several real-time variations of the Yale Shooting Problem [10] appropriate to active logics. The first is a witness scenario where Dudley is a witness to the scene of the crime.

Reference-contexts: In all the problems that we tackle though, we will treat observations and facts synonymously. 4 Actually it only consists of the subset of facts that is relevant to the particular partial plan. <ref> [22] </ref> deals with space bounds on the reasoning and proposes a relevance mechanism to keep the reasoning directed to a particular partial plan for a duration of time. 5 Projections (and persistences) have been studied by numerous authors; see e.g., [26, 12, 18]. <p> Thus, the above formalism, combined with a relevance mechanism offers a fuller treatment of the qualification problem. Details of the space constrained agent are in <ref> [22] </ref>. 5.2 The ramification problem This is the difficulty in explicitly recording all the consequences of an action.

Reference-contexts: In section 3 we sketch the temporal reasoning inference rules for frame-default reasoning. These form part of the real-time planning infrastructure. As a litmus test, we describe in section 4 how the same agent Dudley would behave in various dynamic versions of the infamous Yale shooting problem <ref> [10, 7, 8, 12, 15, 20, 23, 25, 2] </ref>. Section 5 describes Dudley's real-time treatment of the qualification and ramification problems. <p> The reasoning proceeds in time, and itself consumes time. The mechanism functions for the agent whether he/she is the one performing the actions, or observing them. Numerous solutions have been proposed to the YSP; <ref> [7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 14, 20, 23, 25, 2] </ref> to mention a few. Broadly, the solutions may be grouped into three categories: 1. chronological minimization [25, 12], 2. causal minimization [11, 15], and 3. model approach [19, 1].

Reference-contexts: These are indeed fanciful or empty assumptions (Def. 3b) that he must revise nonmonotonically in the face of evidence to the contrary. The underlying mechanism is a formal active logic <ref> [6, 24] </ref>. In this sense, Dudley's `active mind' can use its formal declarative machinery to take leaps of imagination and the term `formal real-time imagination' could aptly describe Dudley's behavior in real-time using active-logics. Temporal projection is an essential component of real-time planning.

The chronological minimization approaches were criticized by Kautz [12], in that, by always granting preference to later changes over earlier ones, the agent may draw artificial conclusions about the time of an action that caused a change. <p> This is highlighted in the `stolen car' problem, where the agent is forced to conclude that the car was stolen only at the last possible moment before it was found missing. Our solution to the YSP has commonalities with certain of these approaches, notably those of Shoham <ref> [25] </ref>, Lifschitz [14], and Kautz [12]. In our approach as well as theirs, defaults are applied forward in time, so that earlier events play out their consequences for later ones. However, these approaches can not solve either the detective scenario or the `stolen car' problems.
