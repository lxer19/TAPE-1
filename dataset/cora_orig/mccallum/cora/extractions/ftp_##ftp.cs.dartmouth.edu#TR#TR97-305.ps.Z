Title: The Self-Organizing Desk

Abstract: The self-organizing desk is a system that enhances a physical desk-top with electronic information. It can remember, organize, update, and manipulate the information contained in the documents on a desk. The system consists of a simple robot eye that can survey the desk, a module for smart extraction of information from the images taken by the robot, a module for representing this information in multiple views, and a module that allows a user to interact with this information.

Reference-contexts: Search. The self-organizing desk can be queried with keywords, with an entire document (full text), with color and layout information, with table information, and any boolean combination of these attributes. We use an augmented version of the Smart System <ref> [Sal91] </ref>, which is a sophisticated text-retrieval system. We augmented Smart to also support color, layout, and table indices. Smart copes well with partially corrupted (by OCR) text. Its basic premise is that two documents are similar if they use the same words. <p> A camera mounted on the desk top is used to project on the desk top rather than extract information [AM+95].

Reference-contexts: The goal of the Intelligent Room project is to create a room surveyed by cameras that can recognize and understand physical gestures. Progress on this project has been reported in <ref> [Tor95] </ref>. The ALIVE project allows users to interact with animated electronic characters and has been descibed in [Mae95].Other related projects include efforts from Euro Xerox and Hitachi to create interactive desks, where the user can write with a stylus pen on the desk top.

This system uses a number of key technologies in robotics, computer vision, OCR, information retrieval, filtering, and organization, and integrates them into a system that solves a new application.
