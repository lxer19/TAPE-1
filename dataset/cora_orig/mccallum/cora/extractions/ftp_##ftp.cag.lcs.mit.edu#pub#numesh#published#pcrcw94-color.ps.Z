Title: Three-Dimensional Network Topologies

Abstract: This paper presents the derivation and performance results of several new three-dimensional topologies. Various transformations can be applied to the conventional six-neighbor mesh in order to construct these topologies, which vary both in number of neighbors (degree) and logical connectivity. Analysis shows that after normalization for constant pin-count, lower-degree topologies yield lower latencies for long messages on unloaded networks, while higher-degree topologies possess higher bandwidth capacities. Although simulation results generally verify these findings, we also observe a surprising amount of difference in the performance between distinct topologies of the same degree.

Reference-contexts: Deadlock avoidance is accomplished by imposing no limits on the number of messages that can be placed on a link, thus in effect allowing an infinite number of virtual channels.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The past few years have seen a rise in popularity of multiprocessors using direct networks that span two or three dimensions. Such networks typically follow the topology of a two or three-dimensional mesh or torus. Although topologies other than the mesh have been studied for two-dimensional space <ref> [7] </ref>, there have been few investigations of alternate topologies in three-dimensional space. This paper proposes five such alternate topologies and presents some analytical and empirical performance results. We restrict our study to direct topologies whose nodes all possess the same number of neighbors, or degree.

Reference-contexts: The results presented in this section are obtained from a uniformly random routing simulation. At every clock tick, each node has a certain probability (the injection rate) of injecting a message to a random destination. In order to achieve a minimal and fully adaptive routing algorithm <ref> [8] </ref>, a routing table of size N fiN is precomputed which contains all links that can be taken for any minimal path between each pair of possible source and destination nodesz.

Reference-contexts: As the load increases, the higher bandwidth of some topologies impose lighter contention penalties on the latencies, resulting in various crossover points in the graph. z Minimal routing algorithms that do not rely on tables also exist for topologies A-D <ref> [9] </ref>. These crossover points can be used to influence the design decisions for a machine. For example, let us examine the crossover point between topologies A and D at the injection rate of 0.003 messages per cycle.
