Reference-contexts: There are three separate components to this paper. The first is that we compute qualitative shape properties from the image intensities themselves. We do not attempt to "reconstruct" the surface <ref> [3, 2] </ref> before computing its qualitative shape. The second component is an examination of the relationship between qualitative shape and shading under two different lighting conditions : a diffuse source, and a point source at the camera. We show how qualitative shape is revealed under these two conditions.

This depiction relation is specified by the Image Irradiance Equation. However, this model is not always applicable, as can be seen in Figure 2. <p> In this section we simply state a well known result <ref> [4, 7, 6] </ref> that when a concave orientation discontinuity is illuminated by a point source, surface luminance attains a local maximum at the discontinuity. 3 This latter effect is due to the mutual illumination of the surfaces on each side of the concave orientation discontinuity. illuminated by a point source normal

Reference-contexts: For example, how much does a pile of rocks 4 have to erode before it becomes a set of hills and valleys ? We take a unified position with respect to qualitative shape and maintain that a global theory is necessary to refine the distinction <ref> [12] </ref>. With this background, we show in this paper that it is often possible to detect qualitative features of the surface shape directly from the image intensities. The idea is that the two notions of qualitative local shape described Figure 1 have something important in common.

Reference-contexts: This percept is clearly in conflict with the Image 6 Irradiance Equation. The main problem is that the Image Irradiance Equation was designed for scenes in which it makes sense to talk about "the illuminant direction".

Most people perceive the scene in scene, the question, "Where is the illuminant?" [15] is meaningless. Although attempts have been made <ref> [16] </ref>, one cannot model surface luminance under diffuse lighting conditions using the Image Irradiance Equation because the surface luminance is not determined by the direction of the local surface normal. 3.1 A Model of Surface Luminance Under Diffuse Light In this section we summarize some of the key elements of a

Reference-contexts: A more detailed analysis can be found in <ref> [17] </ref>. The theory is motivated by Gibson's observation [18] that the ambient light from the sky is of greater luminance than the ambient light from surfaces in the scene. We call this observation the Dominating Sky Principle. <p> The Dominating Sky Principle says that the luminance from the directions D (x) is greater than that coming from the directions H (x)nD (x). This is proved in <ref> [17] </ref> and a lower bound is derived on the difference between the luminance of the diffuse source and the surface luminance. 8 circle (the dotted curve in Figure 3) can be indexed by . The above graph shows incident luminance defined on this circle of directions. <p> The second term is due to the mean luminance from other surface elements in the scene. 1 1 I M will vary with x but this variation is usually quite small over a local region of the surface <ref> [17] </ref>. 9 The model shows explicitly that the amount of the diffuse source seen from a surface element is an important determinant of the luminance of that element. This idea motivates the following definition. <p> We have shown that the surface luminance would then attain local minima at concave orientation discontinuities. Moreover, it can be shown that smooth valleys also typically contain local luminance minima <ref> [17] </ref> . A second image could be made by positioning a point source at the camera, and then subtracting the energy of the previous diffuse image. This difference image would then be due entirely to the point source.

These estimates could be refined with further processing [22], so that, for example, T-junctions could be detected.
