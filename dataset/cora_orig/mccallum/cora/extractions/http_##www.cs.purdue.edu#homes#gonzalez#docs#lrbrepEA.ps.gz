Reference-contexts: Protrusions and depressions on an object are treated as separate solids that are related to the parent solid by their contact faces. One face on the parent is related to one face of the protrusion or the depression <ref> [dFF88, Ad88] </ref>. This relationship is recorded in a face-adjacency hypergraph data structure. However, the definition of higher resolution regions is constrained from spanning several faces at once. Also, the relationship of objects (i.e., features) is related by a tree.

Reference-contexts: Usually, when complex objects are considered, auxiliary structures such as an octree, a BSP tree, an MSP tree, a sphere tree [Hub94], some hierarchical grid structure [FP94], or some hierarchical bounding-volume structure possibly combined with varying levels-of-detail <ref> [AP94] </ref> are added to find which entities on the boundary are closest. Although these work well for lower complexity objects, most fail with complex objects.

Reference-contexts: The representations enumerate all the vertices, edges, and faces along with the topological adjacency information needed for the reconstruction of the boundary. Unfortunately, this boundary information is needed when a dynamics simulation relies on an accurate collision and contact analysis of the regions of contact <ref> [BV94] </ref>. Yet, the large amount of boundary information and the lack of spatial organization in B-reps makes the boundary representations too expensive to use. <p> Modifying the BSP trees to yield a set-theoretic intersection which is necessary to analyze the contact <ref> [BV94] </ref> may destroy their efficiency. 3 Outline Our approach is based on the assumptions that complex and non-convex objects move in non-predictive manners and in close proximity, and when they touch their accurate set-theoretic intersection is required.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the equation maintains a regularized wrapper. 6 Implementation and Empirical Results We have implemented the LRB-rep data structure in C++ as part of the Proxima/Isaac projects <ref> [CG94] </ref>. The LRB-rep extensions were added to a non-manifold B-rep data structure with a topological structure consisting of vertex, edge, directed-edge, face, and brep nodes. The data structure uses bridge-edges for multi-connected faces and it does not represent shells explicitly. <p> In general, this number varies according to the local detail and the average number of faces per collector. Where there is a lot of detail the depth will be greater. 7 Discussion This representation is motivated by our work in collision detection and virtual environments <ref> [CG94] </ref>. In virtual environments, objects bump, slide, and maintain prolonged contact as the norm, not the exception. In general, most objects are in close proximity to other objects.

Reference-contexts: This convexification results in an O (n 2 ) complexity when n convex pieces result. For complex objects, n, can be prohibitively large. Recently, Cohen, Manocha, Lin, and Ponamgi addressed this problem by adding a hierarchy of convex bounding volumes <ref> [CML + 94] </ref>. Empirical results show that the quadratic cost is greatly reduced yielding reasonable performance.

Reference-contexts: A related approach that addresses a similar problem was suggested by de Floriani with the Face-adjacency Multigraph <ref> [dF88] </ref> which is a hierarchical representation using B-reps. Protrusions and depressions on an object are treated as separate solids that are related to the parent solid by their contact faces. One face on the parent is related to one face of the protrusion or the depression [dFF88, Ad88].

Reference-contexts: Much of the early work has focused on the pair-wise collision test of convex objects. To this day, the few systems that deal with multiple non-convex bodies still suffer what Hubbard calls the pair-processing weakness <ref> [Hub93] </ref> in that once objects get very close all the polygons of one object are tested against the polygons of the other. This may not be a real problem if objects are used that have only a few faces. It is a problem if the objects may be arbitrarily complex.

Reference-contexts: In general, most objects are in close proximity to other objects. When the objects are complex, contact analysis and collision detection must take time proportional to the local complexity of the contact and not the global complexity of the objects. For convex objects, Lin and Canny's algorithm <ref> [LC91] </ref> provides a near constant-time incremental algorithm that tracks their minimum distance. This algorithm, however, does not generalize well to non-convex and complex objects undergoing contact analysis. The algorithm does not provide contact region information once contact has been detected, and non-convex objects need to be convexified.

Reference-contexts: The open problem is avoiding this global search and still providing a fully incremental algorithm. To accomplish this for the n-body algorithm, the LRB-rep needs to be combined with a spatial structure such as a BSP tree <ref> [Nay90] </ref>.
Reference: [Nay93] <author> B. Naylor. </author> <title> Constructing good partitioning trees. </title> <booktitle> In CGI'93, </booktitle> <year> 1993. </year>
Reference-contexts: From the spatial perspective, an approach that addresses this problem has been addressed for the Binary Space Partition (BSP) trees by Naylor <ref> [Nay93] </ref>. Naylor shows that BSP trees for complex objects can be constructed which exhibit a local resolution of detail. The local resolution of detail is inherent in the tree structure; higher detail occurs lower in the tree. Controlling the depth thus controls the detail.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, we are confident that we can devise an efficient algorithm for the n-body problem using the LRB-reps. In the future we also plan to generalize the LRB-rep to curved surfaces using Jorg Peters' surface splines <ref> [Pet93] </ref>. 8 Acknowledgments This work is a direct result of a group effort and we would like to acknowledge Jay Perry for generalizing Proxima's B-rep data structure to a non-manifold representation, and Haitao Jiang who has been working on the n-body problem and has offered many helpful suggestions on the LRB-rep.

Reference-contexts: This partitioning should not, however, break space into convex regions that are unrelated to the local geometry of the object or that do not maintain the proximity relationship. 2 Background The idea of representing a polyhedral object at different levels of detail is not new. Pentland and Sclaroff <ref> [PS91] </ref> use deformable superquadric ellipsoids. Their surfaces are modulated by displacement maps with which collisions are easier to detect. This method is appropriate for the class of objects that can be represented by superquadrics.

Reference-contexts: Initial analysis of these problem show, however, that variations on the solutions can overcome these problems. For instance, the asymmetry of the BSP tree classification can be solved by applying Vanecek's classification method used in Boolean set operations <ref> [Van89] </ref>. Consequently, we are confident that we can devise an efficient algorithm for the n-body problem using the LRB-reps.
