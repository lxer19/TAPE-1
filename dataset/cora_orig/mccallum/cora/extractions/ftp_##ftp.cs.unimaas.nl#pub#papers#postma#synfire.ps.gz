Abstract: The rapidity of time-constrained visual identification suggests a feedforward process in which neural activity is propagated through a number of cortical stages. The process is modelled by using a synfire chain, leading to a neural-network model which involves propagating activation waves through a sequence of layers. Theory and analysis of the model's behaviour, especially in the presence of noise, predict enhancement of wave propagation for a range of noise intensities. Simulation studies confirm this prediction. The results are discussed in terms of (spatio-temporal) stochastic resonance. It is concluded that feedforward processes such as time-constrained visual identification may benefit from moderate levels of noise.

Neurophysiological studies show that visual signals entering the retina are propagated through a number of parallel pathways (see, e.g., <ref> [2] </ref>). One such pathway runs from the primary visual cortex (V1), through several intermediate areas, to the inferior temporal (IT) cortex where identification is assumed to take place (see, e.g., [3]).

In conclusion, we have found stochastic resonance in a noisy feedforward processing system. As neural elements are intrinsically noisy <ref> [6] </ref>, we are pleased to discover that such noise is beneficial, rather than requiring suppression, for some types of rapid processing the brain probably employs.

Reference-contexts: An example of such a detection task is the presentation of a brief flash of light onto the retina whence the resulting activity is propagated.

Reference-contexts: We take a threshold value of 1. Hence, (V 1) = 1 if V &gt; 1 and (V 1) = 0 otherwise. The neural dynamics, describing the change of the membrane potential V over time, are defined as (cf. <ref> [11] </ref>) dV l (p; t) = t + i l (p; t t delay ); (2) with t a time constant specifying the decay of the membrane potential. <p> The potential remains zero for a time interval equal to the spike duration. Setting t spike = t delay = 1, integration of equation 2 over the delay time t delay leads to the following discrete approximation of the potential dynamics <ref> [11] </ref>: V l (p; t + 1) = [ffV l (p; t) + i l (p; t) + -(p; t)] (1 V l (p; t)); (3) where ff = exp ( 1 t ) and we have added a Gaussian random variable -(p; t) distributed around zero with standard deviation .

The simplification is, however, sufficient to allow us to study the robustness of wave propagation in the presence of noise. 3 Performance with and without Noise We have investigated the robustness of wave propagation by analysis and simulation studies.

Hopfield <ref> [13] </ref> proposed that spike timing may be used as an encoding mechanism for per-ceptual processing. Combining Hopfield's coding proposal with our model implies a departure from the synchrony required in synfire chains. In this more realistic model, patterns are represented by the relative timings of action potentials.
