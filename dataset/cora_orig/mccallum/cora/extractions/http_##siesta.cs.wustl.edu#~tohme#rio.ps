Abstract: The long term association between Economics and Thermodynamics, seen for example in the borrowing of terms like "comparative statics" or in the use of certain estimation methods in Econometrics, may be strenght-ened with the new tools of Open Systems Thermodynamics. These methods can be applied for the analysis of the behavior of systems away from equilibrium. In this paper we present two models that cannot be analyzed in classical terms as to show how the new conceptual tools of O.S.T. can be applied in order to derive results. yThis is a renewed version of a paper that we were invited to present at the XXX Meeting of the Asociacion Argentina de Economa Poltica in Rio Cuarto(august 1995). We want to give our thanks to the useful comments of Prof. Julio H.G. Olivera and Prof. Daniel Heymann. Of course, errors are only our responsability J.E.L. classification: B41

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In recent years several authors, discussing the logical structure of neoclassical economics, emphasized the influence of Newtonian mechanics on its early development <ref> [1] </ref>. The main support for this argument comes from the fact that the neoclassical thought was deterministic and equilibrium-oriented, qualities associated with philosophical mechanicism, conceptually rooted in classical mechanics [2]. <p> To bound the number of simulations, several parameters will be considered constant: * n = 5 * fi = random 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> * ffi = 0:7 * kk ij k: matrix of random numbers 2 [0; 1], normalized by rows and columns * T = 50 Given these constraints, the following numerical experiments represent, each one, a family of interesting analogous behaviors (see Captions): 1. <p> To bound the number of simulations, several parameters will be considered constant: * n = 5 * fi = random 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> * ffi = 0:7 * kk ij k: matrix of random numbers 2 [0; 1], normalized by rows and columns * T = 50 Given these constraints, the following numerical experiments represent, each one, a family of interesting analogous behaviors (see Captions): 1.

Reference-contexts: The main support for this argument comes from the fact that the neoclassical thought was deterministic and equilibrium-oriented, qualities associated with philosophical mechanicism, conceptually rooted in classical mechanics <ref> [2] </ref>. Despite those arguments, the philosophical influence on early neoclassical authors can be also traced back to another branch of physics: thermodynamics, with its emphasis on the convergence of systems to a static state (recall the idea of a "thermical death of the universe").

Reference-contexts: From this point of view, equilibrium was a state that in itself could not change, because the forces able to produce useful change desappeared. In neoclassical economics, the force behind change of prices was excess demand (Z) and equilibrium was attained only when Z was null <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> which make unpredictable the long term behavior of the system [8]. 3 A Self-organized t^atonnement Given that the principal influence of classical thermodynamics in economic theory was in the representation of market economics, lets consider the behavior of an exchange economy under a t^atonnement process, open to external influences (see <ref> [3] </ref> for the analysis of the isolated case): * _p = Z (ff; p) where p is the system of prices (in the unitary positive ball S + ) and Z (ff; p) is a non-linear excess demand function 1 .The parameter ff, represents the possibility of changing preferences or endowments

Reference-contexts: Their structures do not remain fixed in time. A structure is a characterization of the behavior of a system in a neighborhood in the parameter space. Therefore, this space can be partitioned in stable and unstable regions, according the reaction of the solutions to a slight change in parameters <ref> [4] </ref>. For isolated and closed systems remains valid Boltzmann's principle, which states that changes are always from less to more probable states, being equilibrium the most probable state of such systems.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, with a great number of macrostructures the possibility of unstable behavior increases, given that the spectrum of feasible reactions to external perturbations widens. Therefore, there exist tresholds of structural stability <ref> [5] </ref>. There are several approaches to the analysis of open systems. Their common features are related to the utilization of non-linear systems of differential equations for their representation. <p> This is, maybe, a pointer towards a theory of equilibrium selection [11]. 3 Lets note that cases 2 and 3 do not verify the Index Theorem <ref> [5] </ref> 4 Inter-sectoral dynamics and economic devel- opment An open t^atonnement economy may seem a bit farfetched. This is not the case of economic development, which has not yet a satisfactory representation.

Reference-contexts: Given the characterization above, the theory of dissipative structures studies the path of bifurcations (and their associated macrostructures) that a system subject to random perturbations follows <ref> [6] </ref>. Synergetics, instead, considers phenomena of self-organization, in which eigenvalues of perturbations around a critical parameter are divided in stable and unstable. According to the relative values of the unstable parameters the system reorganizes attaining a new solution path or returning to the original one [7].

According to the relative values of the unstable parameters the system reorganizes attaining a new solution path or returning to the original one <ref> [7] </ref>. <p> The stable modes relax quicky and so they are able to follow the slow relaxation of the unstable modes. This process is called enslaving of the stable modes. An invariant manifold can be defined <ref> [7] </ref>: * e k s i e k u Therefore the system losses degrees of freedom and its whole behavior, when a parameter becomes critical, is determined by the unstable modes.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the so called "chaos science" studies the existence of strange attractors, other than fixed points or periodic or quasi- periodic paths, which make unpredictable the long term behavior of the system <ref> [8] </ref>. 3 A Self-organized t^atonnement Given that the principal influence of classical thermodynamics in economic theory was in the representation of market economics, lets consider the behavior of an exchange economy under a t^atonnement process, open to external influences (see [3] for the analysis of the isolated case): * _p = <p> If the compound F (F 1 ; : : : ; F n ) has a cuadratic form there is a real possibility that the system can attain, for certain initial values, a chaotic behavior <ref> [8] </ref>. 5 Conclusions Its clear that the links between thermodynamics and economics can not be easily discarded.

Reference-contexts: the equilibrium will be of the form: * p 1 (t)=p 2 (t) = p 1 =p 2 + ke @Z 1 (ff;p 1 =p 2 ;1)t , where k is the value of the perturbation in t = 0 2 It can be a cycle, as shown by Scarf <ref> [9] </ref> From the discussion above it is clear that a self-organization will arise when @Z 1 (ff; p 1 =p 2 ; 1) changes sign with a change in ff.

Reference-contexts: This is obviously related to the concept of regular economies, introduced by Debreu <ref> [10] </ref>. Obviously a value of ff such that in an equilibrium @Z 1 (ff; p 1 =p 2 ; 1) = 0 makes the economy not regular.

Reference-contexts: But the point of this example is to show how an economy in continuous transformation can naturally pass through such a non-regular state despite its non-genericity. This is, maybe, a pointer towards a theory of equilibrium selection <ref> [11] </ref>. 3 Lets note that cases 2 and 3 do not verify the Index Theorem [5] 4 Inter-sectoral dynamics and economic devel- opment An open t^atonnement economy may seem a bit farfetched. This is not the case of economic development, which has not yet a satisfactory representation.

Reference-contexts: These results are reminiscent of the hypothesis of disequilibred growth, where the existence of disequilibria is a condition for the advance of the economy <ref> [13] </ref>, [14]. The initial disparities are not a requirement for this behavior. Experiment 1 shows that a homogenously developed economy can grow (or remain stable) in the first stages and without demand shocks it declines to degrees below the initial values.

Reference-contexts: The reason for the appliability of thermodynamical concepts to economics can be found in the common features of economies and physical systems with a great number of components. The analogy 4 For a rationale and a deeper analysis of these results see <ref> [16] </ref> works better in the case of open systems, with their everchang--ing and unstable behaviors. Of course, substantial differences exists and the analogy should not be pushed beyond certain limits.

Reference-contexts: Of course, substantial differences exists and the analogy should not be pushed beyond certain limits. Notwithstanding we find worth to deepen the application of O.S.T. to the analysis of economic phenomena like hyperinflations, financial crashes, etc (see <ref> [17] </ref> for a deep discussion in the same vein as this paper).
