Abstract: A fast image morphing method is presented that deforms an image continuously without foldover, while preserving a given set of trajectories of feature elements. All intermediate images during the morph are homeomorphic to the initial image and the morphing process is a homotopy. The method permits points, line-segments, and polygons to be included as features in the image. Our method is based on time-varying triangulation, that is, triangulation changes as features move. Accordingly, the deformation mapping is updated locally for the part for which the triangulation changes. Our methods have two advantages over many existing methods. First, the method permits points and lines to be used as features. Many methods permit just one type of feature. Secondly, our experimental results show that our method runs order of magnitude times faster than existing approaches for image morphing, especially when a sequence of intermediate images is to be generated.

Reference-contexts: The user defines a trajectory s i (t); t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for each feature from its initial position f i to final position f 0 i . Features which are initially disjoint are assumed to remain disjoint throught their motions. A mapping M t (x) is to be constructed with the following properties. <p> Note that x and t are the spatial and temporal parameters, respectively. 1. The mapping M t (x) preserves the features, i.e., M t (f i ) = s i (t); i = 1; : : : ; n for each t in <ref> [0, 1] </ref>. 2. The mapping M t (x) is a homeomorphism for each t in [0,1]. 3. The mapping M t (x) is continuous for any fixed x in D. <p> A template for a certain smooth function M (x; y) is defined and its coefficients are to be determined such that M (x i ; y i ) interpolates corresponding feature location (x 0 i ; y 0 i ) in the target image. Methods using multiquadratics <ref> [1, 2, 13] </ref>, deformable templates [8], and thin-plate splines [5] belong to this category. Depending on the choice of a template function, feature points may have global or local effects in the morph.

Reference-contexts: The mapping is one-to-one only when source position (x i ; y i ) and destination position (x 0 i ; y 0 i ) of each feature point are sufficiently close to each other. On the other hand, the feature-based metamorphosis method <ref> [4] </ref> uses line-segments as features. In this method, a point in the image is assigned coordinates relative to each line-feature. The destination position of each point in the target image is determined by a weighted sum of the relative coordinates due to all line-features. <p> Computational performance is summarized in the table below. All experiments are run on HP 715/64. For comparison, we have implemented MFFD [9], its improved version MFFD 0 [10], and feature-based metamorphosis (FBM) <ref> [4] </ref>. In our testing, we distinguish `deform time' 6 and `apply time'. The deform time is the time spent on calculating a mapping itself and is dependent on feature configuration but not on the number of pixels in the image. <p> This requires some care when generating their trajectories. That is, if two edges intersect accidentally in the morph process, then our method fails to function. This is not the case for most other approaches including the feature-based metamorphosis method <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Such a process is called rubber-band deformation or isotopic deformation in geometric modeling [12]. It has been pointed out <ref> [6, 9] </ref> that the one-to-one property is desirable for image warping since it produces cleaner images. Beside ensuring the one-to-one property, our approach is distinguished from the past approaches in two aspects. <p> Many algorithms permit only point features for image deformation. Since computation time for image warping is dependent on the number of features, it is advantageous to use line features for delineating face boundaries, etc., compared to using a sequence of point features. Based on image warping work <ref> [6] </ref> using time-varying triangulation, we present a new and improved method which runs an order of magnitude faster than our old algorithm.

To achieve such a speed-up, we use a refined method for maintaining time-varying triangulation. Compared to the image warp algorithm [6], our new method runs about 50 times faster on average for generating a morph consisting of 60 images. In addition, we present a fast method for smoothing morphed images. <p> As a result, only small portion of an image is update at a time, which results in a fast algorithm. Moreover, the morph constructed this way is clearly continuous. 3 Deformation Method We present two methods in this section. The first method, which is an adaptation from <ref> [6] </ref>, is described here to form the basis for the second method, since it makes it easier to illustrate the basic strategy of our method. <p> To find such a time sequence, a recursive strategy can be taken to refine time intervals <ref> [6] </ref>. 4 Although this scheme is simple to understand, it has a disadvantage in the second stage where a possibly long sequence of triangulations has to be traced to find the color to be assigned for pixel p.
