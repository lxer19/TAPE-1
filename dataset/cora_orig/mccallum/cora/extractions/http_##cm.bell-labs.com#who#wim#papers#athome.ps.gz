Reference-contexts: This way no awkward solutions such as zero padding, periodization, or reflection are needed. We point out that many wavelet constructions on the interval already exist, see <ref> [1, 6, 3] </ref>, but we would like to use the subdivision schemes adapted to boundaries since they lead to more straightforward constructions and implementations. * Irregular samples: In many practical applications, the samples do not necessarily live on a regular grid. <p> The basic idea is then to choose, from the set of available samples s j;k , those N which are closest to the new coefficient s j+1;l . To be concrete, take the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. We have 2 j + 1 coefficients s j;k at locations k 2 j for 0 k 2 j . The left most coefficient s j+1;0 is simply s j;0 .

This issue can be addressed in a number of different ways. One treatment, used by Chui and Quak <ref> [3] </ref>, uses multiple knots at the endpoints of the interval. The appropriate subdivision weights then follow from the evaluation of the de Boor algorithm for those control points. The total number of scaling functions at level j becomes 2 j + 3 in this setting.

Reference-contexts: For now one can assume that signals are either periodic or infinite.

Reference-contexts: We know that ff (4) &lt; 2 and ff (6) &lt; 2:830 (strict bounds.) Also, for large N the smoothness increases linearly as :2075N . This fact is much less trivial than the previous ones. We refer to [10, 11] and <ref> [9, p. 226] </ref>. 5. Refinability: This means the scaling function satisfies a refinement relation of the form '(x) = l=N This can be seen as follows. Do one step in the subdivision starting from s 0;k = ffi k;0 . Call the result h l = s 1;l . <p> The translation and dilation properties follow from the definition of V j . The proof of the completeness property is beyond the scope of this tutorial. We refer to <ref> [9] </ref> for more details. A very important property of a multiresolution analysis is the order. <p> We described the construction of wavelets with the help of the lifting scheme, which only uses techniques of the spatial domain. However, historically first generation wavelets were always constructed in the frequency domain with the help of the Fourier transform, see e.g. <ref> [9] </ref>. All the wavelets and scaling functions we described in the first chapter can be derived with these classical methods.

Reference-contexts: Deslauriers and Dubuc attacked this problem by defining a recursive procedure for finding the value of an interpolating function at all dyadic points <ref> [10, 11] </ref>. This algorithm proceeds by inserting a new predicted coefficient inbetween each pair of existing coefficients. Since none of the already existing coefficients will get changed interpolation of the original data is assured. Perhaps the simplest way to set up such an interpolating subdivision scheme is the following. <p> We know that ff (4) &lt; 2 and ff (6) &lt; 2:830 (strict bounds.)

Reference-contexts: level scaling functions to coarser level scaling functions, while during subdivision the same h k are used to go from coarser level samples to finer level samples. 1.6.3 Average-Interpolating Subdivision In contrast to the interpolating subdivision scheme of Deslauriers-Dubuc we now consider another subdivision scheme: average-interpolation as introduced by Donoho <ref> [12] </ref>. To begin with we focus on the basic idea, i.e., how to produce the new values at the finer level directly from the old values at the coarser level. <p> Smoothness: '(x) is continuous of order R, with R = R (N ) &gt; 0. One can show that R (3) :678, R (5) 1:272, R (7) 1:826, R (9) 2:354, and asymptotically R (N ) :2075N <ref> [12] </ref>. 5. Refinability: '(x) satisfies a refinement relation of the form '(x) = l=N+1 This follows from similar reasoning as in the interpolating case starting from s 0;k = ffi 0;k . <p> These constructions are part of the biorthogonal family of scaling functions described by Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau [5], where they are named (1,3) and (1,5) respectively.

Reference-contexts: developed in 1994, but has numerous connections with earlier devel-opments and can even be traced back all the way to the Euclidean algorithm! The development of lifting was inspired by earlier work of Lounsbery et al. concerning wavelet transforms of meshes [18] and work of Donoho concerning interpolating wavelet transforms <ref> [13] </ref>. Both these developments are special cases of lifting. Lifting is also closely related to filter bank constructions of Vetterli and Herley [28] and local decompositions of Carnicer, Dahmen and Pe~na [2]. To make the treatment as accessible as possible we will take a very "nuts and bolts," algorithmic approach.

Reference-contexts: We hasten to point out that this is is a very simple and naive smoothing technique. Depending on the application and knowledge of the underlying processes much more powerful smoothing operators can be constructed <ref> [15, 14] </ref>. This example merely serves to suggest that such operations can also be performed over irregular samples. 2.10.3 Weighted Inner Products When we discussed the construction of scaling functions and wavelets we pointed out how a weight function in the inner product can be incorporated in the transform.

Reference-contexts: The new sample value is defined through evaluation of this polynomial at the new, refined location. A particularly efficient (and stable) procedure for this is Neville's algorithm <ref> [24, 21] </ref>. If all samples are evenly spaced this polynomial and the associated weights need to be computed only once and can be used from then on. Notice also that nothing in the definition of this procedure requires the original samples to be located at integers. <p> The examples were generated with a simple C code whose implementation is a direct transliteration of the algorithms described above. The only essential piece of code imported was an implementation of Neville's algorithm from Numerical Recipes <ref> [21] </ref>. All examples were computed on the unit interval, that is all constructions are adapted to the boundary as described earlier. The only code modification to accommodate this is to insure that the moving window of coefficients does not cross the left or right end point of the interval.

Reference-contexts: Most of the techniques presented here such as polynomial subdivision and lifting extend easily to much more general sets. In particular domains in R n , curves, surfaces, and manifolds. One example is the construction of wavelets on the sphere <ref> [22] </ref>. There we use the lifting 83 scheme to construct locally supported, biorthogonal spherical wavelets and their associated fast transforms. The construction starts from a recursive triangulation of the sphere and is parameterization independent.

Reference-contexts: A weighted inner product of two functions f and g is defined as hf; gi = w (x) f (x) g (x) dx; where w (x) is some positive function. Weighted wavelets are very useful in the solution of boundary value ODEs, see <ref> [25] </ref>. Also, as we will see later, they are useful in the approximation of functions with singularities. Obviously, we are also interested in combinations of these settings. <p> step, the coarser level is computed as [26] s j1;k = s j;2k + I j1;k Using Equation (2.3), one can see that this is equivalent to the weighted average computation. 2.4 Average-Interpolating Subdivision In this section we discuss how average-interpolation works in the second generation case as introduced in <ref> [25] </ref>. The setting is very similar to the first generation case. We first describe the average-interpolating subdivision scheme and then show how this fits into the lifting strategy.

Reference-contexts: Instead of retracing these developments we will focus primarily on the idea of coherence, or smoothness, and its exploitation to motivate and derive the wavelet transform together with a large class of different wavelets. The tool that we use to build wavelets transforms is called the lifting scheme <ref> [27, 26] </ref>. The main feature of the lifting scheme is that all constructions are derived in the spatial domain. This is in contrast to the traditional approach, which relies heavily on the frequency domain. Staying in the spatial domain leads to two major advantages. <p> We therefore refer to them as Second Generation Wavelets <ref> [26] </ref>. The purpose of the remainder of this chapter is to show that subdivision, interpolation, and lifting taken together result in a versatile and straightforward to implement second generation wavelets toolkit. <p> The prediction for an odd coefficient s j;2k+1 is its left neighboring even sample s j;2k which leads to the detail coefficient: d j1;k = s j;2k+1 s j;2k : In the update step, the coarser level is computed as <ref> [26] </ref> s j1;k = s j;2k + I j1;k Using Equation (2.3), one can see that this is equivalent to the weighted average computation. 2.4 Average-Interpolating Subdivision In this section we discuss how average-interpolation works in the second generation case as introduced in [25]. <p> Recent results concerning general multiscale transforms and their stability were obtained by Wolfgang Dahmen and his collaborators. They have been working (independently from <ref> [26, 27] </ref>) on a scheme which is very similar to the lifting scheme [2, 8]. In particular, Dahmen shows in [7] which properties in addition to invertibility of the transform are needed to assure stable bases.
