Reference-contexts: We denote the P-dimension of F by P-dim (F ). This definition is discussed in <ref> [12] </ref>[15][16]. It is called the pseudo dimension in [16] and the combinatorial dimension in [12]. Graph-shattering (G-shattering) and the Graph-dimension (G-dimension) are defined similarly with defined by (i; j) = 1 if i = j : (14) The G-dimension of F is denoted by G-dim (F ). This definition is treated in [14]. <p> It appears, however, that the bounds of this paper are more useful when applying the results of section 3 (see e.g. <ref> [12] </ref>). 4 Here we say that y and z witness F 's fl-shattering of I and say f 2 F satisfies b 2 f0; 1g jIj if and only if fl ( f j I ; y; z) = b: (18) We say F N-shatters I if F fl-shatters I with <p> max (d; m; N 1 ; :::; N m ) = i=0 S2 mi k2S When there is an N 2 N such that N i = N for all i; 1 i m, we obtain the following corollary, which is useful for obtaining learning results such as those in <ref> [12] </ref>. 5 Corollary 3 Let d; m 2 Z + ; N 2 N be such that d m.

Then we have jf i h i j = fi fi f i 2* f i fi fi = 2* fi fi 2* 2* 2 fi fi (100) 2 Further measurability assumptions are required. See <ref> [12] </ref>. 12 Since i was chosen arbitrarily, d L 1 (f; h) = maxfjf i h i j : 1 i mg *: (102) Since f 2 F was chosen arbitrarily, H is an *-cover for F .

Theorem 17 Let F be a set 4 of random variables on S such that there exists M 2 R + with 0 f (~) M for all f 2 F and ~ 2 S. <p> In addition, we have applied this result to bound the rate of convergence of empirical estimates of the expectations of a sequence of random variables to their true expectations, obtaining bounds similar to those already derived in [15] <ref> [12] </ref>.

The primary motivation for this research, however, was to attempt to find some simple property of a class of functions that would characterize the uniform rate of convergence of estimates to true means.
