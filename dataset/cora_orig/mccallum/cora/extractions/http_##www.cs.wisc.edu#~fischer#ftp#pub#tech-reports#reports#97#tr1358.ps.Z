Abstract: Most organizations that offer external access to their data would benefit from some mechanism that ensures a desired level of service for local users. In this paper, we propose such a mechanism, called the provider agent (PA) architecture, that protects local users by ensuring a (DBA specified) quality of service for local requests in the face of computational demands made by external requests. The PA is a general purpose solution that enhances most information systems currently available. The novelty of our approach is the combination of request profiling with load control mechanisms to improve both protection and performance, while not requiring any modifications to the underlying information system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques with a prototype

Reference-contexts: The PA mediates between the provider and the external world (see Figure 1), much like most multi-database (MDBS) solutions <ref> [5, 26] </ref>. The architecture is designed to work with any type of data provider available today, for example, a DBMS, a Web server, an FTP server, or even data generating programs like a simulation system.

A few vendors, especially noteworthy is IBM's DB2 for MVS <ref> [7] </ref>, have some load control mechanisms similar to ours, but as far as we are aware, they do not have our fractional MPL mechanisms and they do not use profiling to enhance external scheduling.

Reference-contexts: A work-around to these limitations is to replicate the profiler in the PA, similar to the approach taken in the Pegasus project at HP <ref> [10] </ref>. The profiler will frequently consult catalog information, so to avoid placing an additional strain on the provider, all of the needed catalog information should also be replicated within the PA.

Reference-contexts: This mechanism can be used in three related but distinct ways. First, it can detect periods of relatively low activity, similar to the way the Condor system <ref> [18] </ref> finds idle resources to run batch programs. If the local workload experiences periods of high and low activity throughout the day, the PA can run external jobs during the periods of low activity.
