Title: Reciprocating with learned models

Abstract: In our prior work, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of a probabilistic reciprocity mechanism by which self-interested agents may learn to adopt a cooperative relationship with other similar agents. Reciprocative decisions were made based on the balance of help with another agent. In this paper, we expand that framework by making an agent explicitly model the help-giving procedure of the other agent. This learned model is then used to make decisions on requests for help received from that agent. We show that when asking for help consumes non-negligible time, the model based reciprocative agents can outperform the reciprocative agents who uses only balance of past transactions.

Reference-contexts: This mechanism was also found to be robust in the presence of misconception about the amount of help received (Sen & Biswas 1998). Others have evaluated systems of heterogeneous agents with different, but fixed, cooperative attitudes <ref> (Cesta & Miceli 1996) </ref>. We are interested in developing agents that can adapt its behavior to other agents in the group.

Reference-contexts: The resultant system was found to exhibit close to optimal throughput with a fair distribution of the workload among the participating agents. This mechanism was also found to be robust in the presence of misconception about the amount of help received <ref> (Sen & Biswas 1998) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We investigate the choice of interaction strategies and environmental characteristics that will make the best self-interested actions to be cooperative in nature. In our previous work <ref> (Sen 1996) </ref>, we have analyzed the inadequacy of traditional deterministic reciprocity mechanisms (Axelrod 1984) to promote cooperative behavior with a fair distribution of the workload. We proposed a probabilistic reciprocity mechanism and showed that it can generate stable and cooperative behavior among a group of self-interested agents.
