Abstract: Information modeling goes beyond static representations of information. While operations (mentioned previously) give users the ability to impose behavior on models, they still fall short of providing a comprehensive environment which users can customize. In order to provide user customization, we intend to incorporate an event/rule mechanism into n-dim. This would most likely be done by using an existing rule-based system such as CLIPS [1994] or RAL [Forgy, 1994]. The basic premise is that a user can establish rules that are invoked when particular events occur in the system. For example, a user may design a rule to have a particular operation invoked when a new issue is added to an issue forest. This gives a user the ability to configure n-dim in a radically different way. In the case of IWEB, for instance, we wrote a separate user interface. We identified two important drawbacks to this exercise: an experienced programmer had to write the interface and someone attempting to use IWEB needs to explicitly load the IWEB user interface code. For this and other reasons we wish to model our user interface toolkit in n-dim such that users can build interfaces in the same manner that they design models. We could associate an interface with a particular model or modeling language. such that, when certain models are opened, the system uses the user-defined interface instead of the default interface. The ability to search for models in an extremely sophisticated matter is a crucial aspect of n-dim. Since one of our main requirements for n-dim is that it be useful in accumulating the information history of an entire organization over time, we anticipate rapidly accumulating a large number of published and public models. Finding specific models or models fitting certain criteria is therefore very critical. In addition, the criteria of a search is in itself useful information that a user may want to keep, publish, revise, etc. Again, the logical solution would be to model search criteria in n-dim.
