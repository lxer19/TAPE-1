Abstract: Dual-Route and Connectionist Single-Route models of reading have been at odds over claims as to the correct explanation of the reading process. Recent Dual-Route models predict that subjects should show an increased naming latency for irregular words when the irregularity is earlier in the word (e.g. chef is slower than glow) a prediction that has been confirmed in human experiments. Since this would appear to be an effect of the left-to-right reading process, Coltheart & Rastle (1994) claim that Single-Route parallel connectionist models cannot account for it. A refutation of this claim is presented here, consisting of network models which do show the interaction, along with orthographic neighborhood statistics that explain the effect.

Reference-contexts: Advocates of a dual-route model of oral reading claim that two separate routes, one lexical (a lexicon, often hypothesized to be an associative network) and one rule-based, are required to account for certain phenomena in reaction times and nonword pronunciation seen in human subjects <ref> (Coltheart et al., 1993) </ref>. Connectionist modelers claim that the same phenomena can be captured in a single-route model which learns simply by exposure to a representative dataset (Seidenberg and McClelland, 1989). In the Dual-Route Cascade model (DRC) (Coltheart et al., 1993), the lexical route is implemented as an Interactive Activation (McClelland <p> for certain phenomena in reaction times and nonword pronunciation seen in human subjects <ref> (Coltheart et al., 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Irregularity Position that the amount of delay experienced in naming an exception word is related to the phonemic position of the irregularity in pronunciation. Specifically, the earlier the exception occurs in the word, the longer the latency to the onset of pronouncing the word. Table 1, adapted from <ref> (Coltheart and Rastle, 1994) </ref> shows the response latencies to two-syllable words by normal subjects. There is a clear left-to-right ranking of the latencies compared to controls in the last row of the Table. Coltheart et al. claim this delay ranking cannot be achieved by standard connectionist models. <p> If an irregularity is late in a word, the correct pronunciation will begin to be activated before the GPC route is able to vote against it. Hence late irregularities will not be as affected by conflicting information. This result is validated by simulations with the one-syllable DRC model <ref> (Coltheart and Rastle, 1994) </ref>. Several connectionist systems have been developed to model the orthography to phonology process (Seidenberg and McClelland, 1989; Plaut et al., 1996). These connectionist models provide evidence that the task, with accompanying phenomena, can be learned through a single mechanism. <p> The provided format was not amenable to an automated method for distinguishing the number of syllables in the word. To obtain syllable counts, English two-syllable words were gathered from the Medical Research Council (MRC) Psycholinguistic Database <ref> (Coltheart and Rastle, 1994) </ref>, which is conveniently annotated with syllable counts and frequency (only those with Kucera-Francis written frequency of one or greater were selected). Intersecting the two databases resulted in 5,924 two-syllable words. <p> The single-syllable network described above was tested on the collection of single-syllable words identified as irregular by (Taraban and McClelland, 1987). In <ref> (Coltheart and Rastle, 1994) </ref>, control words are selected based on equal number of letters, same beginning phoneme, and Kucera-Francis frequency between 1 and 20 (controls were not frequency matched). <p> Two Syllable Words Testing of the two-syllable network is identical to that of the one-syllable network. The difference in MSE for each test word and its corresponding control is calculated, averaging across all test pairs in the position set. Both test words and their controls are those found in <ref> (Coltheart and Rastle, 1994) </ref>. The 2-syllable network appears to produce approximately the correct linear trend in the naming MSE/latency (Figure 2), although the results displayed are not monotonically decreasing with position. Note, however, that the results presented by Coltheart, when taken separately, also fail to exhibit this trend (Table 1). <p> These neighborhoods therefore tend to consist of words that rhyme (MUST, DUST, TRUST). There is independent evidence that these word-body neighbors are psychologically relevant for word naming tasks (i.e., pronunciation) (Treiman and Chafetz, 1987). The neighborhood measure given by Coltheart <ref> (Coltheart and Rastle, 1994) </ref>, N, counts same-length words which differ by only one letter, taking string position into account. Finally, edit-distance-1 (ED1) neighborhoods are those words which can be generated from the target word by making one change (Peereman, 1995): either a letter substitution, insertion or deletion. <p> The neighborhoods for the two-syllable data set were thus examined. Two syllable results Recall that the two-syllable test words are those used in the <ref> (Coltheart and Rastle, 1994) </ref> subject study, for which naming latency differences are shown in Table 1. Coltheart's 1-letter-different neighborhood definition is not very informative in this case, since by this criterion most of the target words provided in (Coltheart and Rastle, 1994) are loners (i.e., have no neighbors at all). <p> results Recall that the two-syllable test words are those used in the <ref> (Coltheart and Rastle, 1994) </ref> subject study, for which naming latency differences are shown in Table 1.

However, using a neighborhood based on T&M-2 recreates the desired ranking (Figure 2) as indicated by the ratio of hindering pronunciations to the total of the helping and hindering pronunciations.

Reference-contexts: In particular, Plaut et al. (henceforth PMSP) develop a recurrent network which duplicates the naming latencies appropriate to their data set, consisting of approximately 3000 one-syllable English words (monosyllabic words with frequency greater than 1 in the Kucera & Francis corpus <ref> (Kucera and Francis, 1967) </ref>). Naming latencies are computed based on time-to-settle for the recurrent network, and based on MSE for a feed-forward model used in some simulations.

Reference-contexts: In a complete model of reading, message understanding must play a role, but many psycholinguistic phenomena can be explained in the context of this simple mapping task. A difficulty in learning this mapping is that in a language such as English, the mapping is quasiregular <ref> (Plaut et al., 1996) </ref>; there are a wide range of exceptions to the general rules. As with nearly all psychological phenomena, more frequent stimuli are processed faster, leading to shorter naming latencies.

This provides an improvement over, and a validation of, previous work with a strictly feed-forward network <ref> (Seidenberg and McClelland, 1989) </ref>. However, to date, no one has shown that Coltheart's naming latency by irregularity of position interaction can be accounted for by such a model.

For each word, we calculate its (enemy) / (friend+enemy) ratio; these ratios are then averaged over all the words in the position set. The results using neighborhoods as defined in Taraban & McClel-land clearly show the desired rank ordering of effect.

Reference-contexts: Taraban & McClelland (1987) neighborhoods (T&M) are defined as words containing the same vowel grouping and final consonant cluster. These neighborhoods therefore tend to consist of words that rhyme (MUST, DUST, TRUST). There is independent evidence that these word-body neighbors are psychologically relevant for word naming tasks (i.e., pronunciation) <ref> (Treiman and Chafetz, 1987) </ref>. The neighborhood measure given by Coltheart (Coltheart and Rastle, 1994), N, counts same-length words which differ by only one letter, taking string position into account. <p> However, the N and the ED-1 measure have not been shown to be psychologically real in terms of affecting naming latency <ref> (Treiman and Chafetz, 1987) </ref>. We therefore extended T&M neighborhoods to multi-syllable words. Each vowel group is considered within the context of its rime, with each syllable considered separately. Consonant neighborhoods consist of orthographic clusters which correspond to the same location in the word.
