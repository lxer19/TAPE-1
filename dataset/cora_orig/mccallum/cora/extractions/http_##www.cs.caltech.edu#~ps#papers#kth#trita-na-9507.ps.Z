Reference-contexts: The short time evolution operator is built in a wavelet basis and by efficient repeated squarings, the long-time operator is obtained. * Building efficient preconditioners using the wavelet decomposition of discrete elliptic operators. In the 1D case we find the well-known diagonal preconditioner, see Jaffard [38] or Beylkin <ref> [5] </ref>. In the 2D case we find a connection between separation of variables and an extended 1D wavelet transform that permits the incorporation of the 1D diagonal preconditioners into a 2D structure. <p> The effect of this scaling is that (RL J R) is bounded, as shown by S. Jaffard [38]. Similar results are obtained by G. Beylkin <ref> [5] </ref> using the classical central-difference approximation of the second derivative under the wavelet transform, rather then the Galerkin discretizations. We construct a diagonal preconditioner in the Haar basis. <p> For non-periodic boundary conditions, the 2D preconditioner does not obtain the bounded condition number. Experiments show that the condition number grows like N , which is consistent with the behavior of the 1D case explained by Beylkin <ref> [5] </ref>. However, the eigenvalues of the Jacobi iteration operator I +RL J R are clustered together, which make the Conjugate Gradient iteration efficient. <p> Wavelet decomposition was embedded in Multigrid iterations by R. Wells et al. [72]. Petrov-Galerkin methods for boundary integral equations were studied by W. Dahmen et al. [18] and many others [25, 61]. Wavelet based preconditioning was considered by G. Beylkin <ref> [5] </ref> and others [17, 39, 38, 43]. Numerical homogenization of integral equations was done by G. Beylkin [10] and also by S. Wu [75]. When the Calderon-Zygmund analysis is not applicable, the problems are of much greater difficulty and the results are not as extensive as in the elliptic case. <p> The evolution operators of implicit schemes are competitive only if they can be inverted directly in the wavelet basis. This can be done efficiently using a preconditioned iteration described by Beylkin <ref> [5] </ref>. 3.3 Error Analysis of Truncation Let us analyze the error committed by the trunc operation in Algorithm 3. When " = 0, algorithms 1 and 3 coincide and produce after i steps the discrete evolution operator E 2 i e 2 i tL J . <p> The much larger amount of work of the explicit scheme is due to the first "heavy" squarings, i.e., for 2 n t t i . However, the implicit approach needs the inversion of I t i E i . This is done efficiently by the techniques found in Beylkin <ref> [5] </ref>, using the diagonal preconditioner presented in Chapter 4. The inversion formula needs multiplications of matrices with the maximal 35 Density of evolution operators at each squaring step of Algorithm 3. The plots are shifted so that the times at which the matrices approximate the exact solution operator match. <p> The diagonalization property of the Fourier Transform in the constant coefficients cannot be recovered in the wavelet setting but the condition number of the preconditioned iteration matrix will be bounded. Such methods are described by Jaffard [38], Beylkin <ref> [5] </ref> and Kunoth [43]. This chapter is organized as follows: First we analyze the construction of the diagonal preconditioner in the Haar basis. It turns out that the simple Haar basis functions do not have enough regularity to improve the linear system's conditioning effectively. <p> It turns out that the simple Haar basis functions do not have enough regularity to improve the linear system's conditioning effectively. Then we repeat the construction with more regular Daubechies wavelets and find some results due to Beylkin <ref> [5] </ref>. Experiments indicate an important improvement over the FFT-based preconditioner in the case of coefficients with jumps. <p> In the Multigrid setting, the error equation is solved on each level V j . If the original problem has Dirichlet boundary conditions, then Multigrid essentially solves problems with periodic (zero) boundary conditions. 60 Treating Dirichlet boundary conditions as a low-rank perturbation of the periodic problem, Beylkin <ref> [5] </ref> uses the diagonal preconditioning to invert the periodized operator and then updates it with the aid of the Sherman-Morrison formula. <p> Although wavelets do not diagonalize the derivatives, the diagonal preconditioner achieves a grid-independent bound on the condition number of discrete elliptic operators. They out-perform the FFT-based preconditioners when the coefficients have jumps. Evolution operators of implicit schemes can be computed directly in the wavelet basis using techniques described in <ref> [5] </ref>. Two dimensional diagonal preconditioners exist, but they are difficult to represent due to the complicated structure of the tensor-product basis. By mapping the computational domain to a line and using 1D wavelet transforms we construct a preconditioner which has diagonal BCR representation.

Reference-contexts: There is an exact meaning to be assigned to the homogenized operator. The wavelet transform becomes a systematic method for deriving homogenized equations even if the asymptotic behavior of the solution is unknown. Integral equations are treated in this manner by Beylkin et al. <ref> [10] </ref>. 2 The basic tool for our analysis is the wavelet transform. We use the orthonormal bases of compactly supported wavelets, invented by Daubechies [19], which have fast direct and inverse transforms. The important properties of the wavelet basis (orthogonality, vanishing moments, etc) are analytic in their nature. <p> Homogenization using asymptotic expansions is presented in Papanicolau et al. [46]. The Multiresolution Analysis framework is a natural setting for defining fine and coarse scales, see also Brewster and Beylkin <ref> [10] </ref>. Essentially we have a basis change such that a discrete function u 2 R 2n is transformed into [w v] &gt; 2 R n R n . The transformation is such that v contains local averages of u, i.e. v is a coarser version of u. <p> be very diagonal dominant and thus approximations of A 1 are much easier to compute than L 1 . * The matrices A, B, C and D inherit properties such as band-diagonal dominance from the fine scale operator L. 6 The wavelet homogenization approach is applied by Brewster and Beylkin <ref> [10] </ref> to the time-variable of integral equations. We use similar techniques to discrete elliptic operators. We start with the Haar basis and the representation of the discrete derivatives and multiplication-by-functions operators. We find that the homogenized operator can be written as a finite-difference approximation with a matrix coefficient. <p> Wells et al. [72]. Petrov-Galerkin methods for boundary integral equations were studied by W. Dahmen et al. [18] and many others [25, 61]. Wavelet based preconditioning was considered by G.

Apart from deriving effective equations, homogenization is used by B. Engquist and E. Lou [28] to derive the coarse scale operator in Multigrid iterations. M. E. Brewster and G. Beylkin <ref> [10] </ref> describe a homogenization procedure based on a MRA decomposition. They consider integral equations, which may arise e.g. from the Method of Lines discretization of a PDE, and homogenize over the time-variable. In a MRA, the concept of different scales is contained in the nested spaces V j .

We use the orthonormal bases of compactly supported wavelets, invented by Daubechies <ref> [19] </ref>, which have fast direct and inverse transforms. The important properties of the wavelet basis (orthogonality, vanishing moments, etc) are analytic in their nature. By restricting ourselves to finite-dimensional spaces, these properties are viewed as algebraic. In the same spirit, we are concerned mostly with discretized differential operators. <p> Signal and image processing (identification, de-noising, compression) were the first to benefit from MRA and the fast wavelet transform. In fact the development of wavelet theory is closely related to its applications in signal and image processing. In 1988 I.

This implies that has compact support too. In her famous 1988 paper, Ingrid Daubechies <ref> [19] </ref> proved the following theorem: Theorem 1 For any positive integer M there exists exists a shape function ' supported in (0; 2M ) such that ' = n=0 and the corresponding mother wavelet = n=0 is compactly supported and its first M moments vanish.

Invariance to dilations, i.e. f 2 V j , f (2 j ) 2 V 0 ; 8j 2 Z. 4. <p> These are known as coiflets and permit a fast, one-point quadrature for approximating P j f directly from values of f . There are constructions that yields more symmetric shape functions. These techniques are described by Daubechies <ref> [20] </ref>. Another popular approach is that of bi-orthogonal wavelets, that is two MRA hierarchies V j ; f V j such that V j ? f V j . Such spaces contain much simpler functions, (e.g. piece-wise polynomials) and the basis functions have nice properties (e.g. smoothness, symmetries). <p> Except for the Haar basis, the supports of the basis functions "spill out" of the interval. Truncation outside the interval destroys orthogonality. One idea, described in Daubechies <ref> [20] </ref>, is to periodize the basis functions by adding the left-overs from one boundary to the other side. This is done by picking a basis 12 function ' j;k whose support intersects the unit interval and adding to it its integer translates. <p> In particular, the formulae for the direct and inverse wavelet transform are preserved. However, this approach introduces a jump when analyzing non-periodic functions. A strategy due to Y. Meyer, also mentioned by Daubechies <ref> [20] </ref>, is to truncate the basis functions of V j outside the unit interval, followed by an orthogonalization procedure. Then we subtract from the truncated wavelets their projection onto the new space V j and do another orthogonalization of the new basis of W j . <p> They are found e.g. in <ref> [20, 39] </ref>. <p> Such bases exist according to Theorem 1. There exists a relation between the number of vanishing moments of and the regularity of ' (and ), namely if the wavelets have M vanishing moments, ' 2 C fiM , with fi 0:2, see e.g. <ref> [20] </ref>. 4.3.1 Stencils of differential operators Let us choose a MRA such that V j H 1 (0 1) and assume that we are interested in solving the equation Lu = u 00 = f in the space V j .

Reference-contexts: The "standard" methods make use of the integral representation of the solution operator. The representation in wavelet basis using e.g. the Boundary Element Methods, is found in works of Beylkin, Coifman, Rokhlin [6], David [21] and many others. We adopt a different approach, first used by En-gquist et al. <ref> [27] </ref> for parabolic evolution operators. We can regard the solution operator of an elliptic problem as the long-time evolution operator of the corresponding parabolic equation. <p> This approach cannot be used directly in practice because although E J is sparse, the matrix E n J is dense for large n and the squarings require a prohibitively high computational effort. Engquist, Osher and Zhong <ref> [27] </ref> propose computing E n J in a wavelet basis. They argue that the rows of E n J are discrete Green's functions of a heat kernel at long time (t = nt). <p> Numerical homogenization of integral equations was done by G. Beylkin [10] and also by S. Wu [75]. When the Calderon-Zygmund analysis is not applicable, the problems are of much greater difficulty and the results are not as extensive as in the elliptic case. B. En-gquist et al. <ref> [27] </ref> computed the wavelet-compressed evolution operator of finite difference schemes. Applications to hyperbolic problems are much fewer. The wavelet discretization of the transport equation was analyzed by J. Walden [71]. V. Perrier et al. [12, 13, 56] followed the ideas of [4, 6] to more complicated equations. J.M. <p> The idea underlying this chapter is to translate the Algorithm 1 in some wavelet basis where the discrete evolution operator S i can be represented as a sparse matrix (after truncating away small entries) and the squaring operation becomes fast. This idea is described by Engquist, Osher and Zhong <ref> [27] </ref>. Further studies are done by the author in [22]. Compression of the evolution operators in wavelet bases are also discussed by Wickerhauser [57] and Perrier [13]. First we describe the different wavelet versions of Algorithm 1. <p> The squaring step of Algorithm 1 is invariated by the orthogonal transformation W since WS 2 2 Re-write Algorithm 1 in the wavelet basis of V J : Algorithm 2 (Engquist, Osher, Zhong <ref> [27] </ref>) Set S 0 = WEW &gt; and C 0 = WF .

Reference-contexts: Recently, Coifman and Meyer proved a theorem regarding the convergence of certain non-linear operators and used it to build the homogenize families of elliptic operators. Wu [75] extended the method to parabolic operators. Apart from deriving effective equations, homogenization is used by B. Engquist and E. Lou <ref> [28] </ref> to derive the coarse scale operator in Multigrid iterations. M. E. Brewster and G. Beylkin [10] describe a homogenization procedure based on a MRA decomposition. They consider integral equations, which may arise e.g. from the Method of Lines discretization of a PDE, and homogenize over the time-variable.

The steady-state solution of the parabolic equation is given by the evolution operator e tL with t ! 1. <p> An obvious improvement is to damp each frequency with the appropriate factor, which implies the separation of frequencies.

Reference-contexts: The short time evolution operator is built in a wavelet basis and by efficient repeated squarings, the long-time operator is obtained. * Building efficient preconditioners using the wavelet decomposition of discrete elliptic operators. In the 1D case we find the well-known diagonal preconditioner, see Jaffard <ref> [38] </ref> or Beylkin [5]. In the 2D case we find a connection between separation of variables and an extended 1D wavelet transform that permits the incorporation of the 1D diagonal preconditioners into a 2D structure. <p> The effect of this scaling is that (RL J R) is bounded, as shown by S. Jaffard <ref> [38] </ref>. Similar results are obtained by G. Beylkin [5] using the classical central-difference approximation of the second derivative under the wavelet transform, rather then the Galerkin discretizations. We construct a diagonal preconditioner in the Haar basis. <p> The following are just examples that highlight the main directions of research, the list is by no means exhaustive.

This chapter is organized as follows: First we analyze the construction of the diagonal preconditioner in the Haar basis.

In the preconditioned case, the corresponding mode is reduced by 22:56%. S. Jaffard <ref> [38] </ref> proves the existence of a diagonal preconditioner (in wavelet basis) for the Galerkin discretization of elliptic problems. His argument is based on Theorem 5 applied to functions in u = H 1 (0 1) which vanish at the endpoints. Let us follow a sketch of the proof.

Reference-contexts: In two dimensions, the situation is more difficult since the characters of the fine and coarse scale differential operators may differ. Homogenization using asymptotic expansions is presented in Papanicolau et al. <ref> [46] </ref>. The Multiresolution Analysis framework is a natural setting for defining fine and coarse scales, see also Brewster and Beylkin [10]. Essentially we have a basis change such that a discrete function u 2 R 2n is transformed into [w v] &gt; 2 R n R n . <p> The intuitive explanation is that the high frequencies of solution may combine with the high frequencies of the differential operator to yield low frequency components. The homogenization problem can be stated in various formulations. A classical formulation, see e.g. Papanicolau et al. <ref> [46] </ref>, is the following: Consider a family of operators L " indexed by the small parameter ", and for a given f let u " solve the problem L " u " = f: (33) Assume that u " ! u, in some meaning, as " ! 0. <p> The homogenized equation is usually much simpler to solve. In the case of effective coefficients, the solution of the homogenized equation contains no high frequency components and thus it is an approximation to the coarse scale behavior of u " . The approach of Papanicolau et al. <ref> [46] </ref> is to use asymptotic expansions of u " and of the operator's coefficients to derive the form of the homogenized operator L. The coefficients of L " need not converge (not even weakly). This is already seen in the case of the effective coefficients. <p> A. Bensoussan, J.-L. Lions and G. Papanicolau <ref> [46] </ref> introduced the multiple scales asymptotic expansions method. F. Murat and L. Tartar [70] use compensated compactness methods. Recently, Coifman and Meyer proved a theorem regarding the convergence of certain non-linear operators and used it to build the homogenize families of elliptic operators.

This approach is successful in compressing the dense representation of discrete integral equations where the kernel has a smooth behavior except for e.g. a diagonal singularity, see e.g., <ref> [6, 18, 21, 25, 61] </ref>. Using wavelets as test-functions, the kernel's information is concentrated in a few entries. The other entries can be ignored, committing a controlled error. Manipulation of the truncation strategy pro duces a sparse high order approximation of the integral equations.

Reference-contexts: A candidate for a one-sided preconditioner is the inverse R = L 1 J since (RL J ) = (L 1 If L J is symmetric, then there exists the decomposition L J = U DU &gt; , where D is a diagonal matrix, see e.g. Strang <ref> [66] </ref>. In this case we prefer a two-sided preconditioner which will preserve the symmetry of the iteration operator. When L J is positive definite, as is the case of discrete elliptic operators, D contains only negative entries.
