Reference-contexts: Smith and Rothkopf [21] consider the bidder's problem in a simultaneous auction without combinatorial bids when there is a fixed charge incurred if any bid succeeds. Rassenti, Smith and Bulfin [17], Banks, Ledyard and Porter <ref> [1] </ref> and McCabe, Rassenti and Smith [13] describe laboratory experiments with continuous-time auction mechanisms for simultaneous auctions with interdependent values. The first of these papers also states the integer programming problem that must be solved to select the set of nonconflicting combinatorial bids that maximizes revenue from the auction.

Reference-contexts: Let B = fB a;a+1;b;b+1 : 1 a &lt; n and 1 b &lt; ng where B a;b;c;d := f (x; y) 2 X : a x b and c y dg. Then finding a C OP T is a NP-complete problem. Proof : As was shown in <ref> [2] </ref>, the optimal 2 fi 2 salvage problem is NP-complete. The input for this problem is an n fi n grid and some set S of unit squares with integer coordinates.

Reference-contexts: When such synergies are present, this should result in both greater revenue for the bid-taker and in an economically more efficient allocation of assets to bidders. Bykowsky, Cull and Ledyard <ref> [3] </ref> illustrate situations in which permitting combinatorial bids is essential to an efficient outcome. There are two potential disadvantages of allowing combinatorial bids. The first of these, the "threshold" problem (inaptly called the "free-rider" problem in Milgrom and Wilson [16]), can occur when diseconomies of scale predominate. <p> The first of these papers also states the integer programming problem that must be solved to select the set of nonconflicting combinatorial bids that maximizes revenue from the auction. Bykowsky, Cull and Ledyard <ref> [3] </ref> discuss "local equilibria" of simple and complex auction mechanisms. Krisha and Rosenthal [11] consider a simple model where "local" bidders compete for only one of two assets, while "global" bidders compete for both (without permitting combined bids), with a synergy should they win both.

Reference-contexts: In our analysis of the complexity of finding an optimal outcome, we will use the standard asymptotic notation for growth of functions (o (f (n)), O (f (n)) and (f (n))). Precise definitions can be found, for example, in <ref> [4] </ref> or [7]. - 5 - A related important issue in designing a simultaneous auction is that for every losing bid, i.e., combination B such that B 2 B C OP T , there is a need for easy way to calculate the bid on B that would be necessary to

Reference-contexts: Proof : The problem of finding C OP T is equivalent to finding a maximum-weight matching in G which can be found in O (n 3 ) time [8]. The weighted matching problem was first solved by Edmonds <ref> [6] </ref>. Algorithms for finding maximum-weight matching are not particularly transparent and are considered to be among the most complicated polynomial algorithms in combinatorial optimization.

Reference-contexts: This problem is known to be NP-complete (Karp <ref> [10] </ref>). As we show later, the problem is easy for some classes of hypergraphs. Any such hypergraph leads to design of a managable simultaneous auction. We concentrate on hypergraph structures that (might) have applications in practice.

Reference-contexts: This issue was raised in the FCC auction design debate by McAfee <ref> [12] </ref>. In the worst case, the bid taker offering n assets could receive offers on 2 n 1 different combinations of assets. Clearly, bid evaluation will present a computational problem when n is large. The FCC is in the process of selling over 2,500 licences.

Reference-contexts: Nalebuff and Jeremy I. Bulow for Bell Atlantic, Peter Cramton for MCI, and R. Mark Isaac for CTIA. There were also sophisticated rounds of replies to the responses, three conferences to discuss issues in the auction design, and pilot experiments conducted at the California Institute of Technology. McMillan <ref> [14] </ref> describes many of the issues. The potential advantage of allowing combinatorial bids in a simultaneous auction is that it allows bidders to express their synergistic values. <p> An interested reader should consult McMillan <ref> [14] </ref> and the extensive material in the FCC's Docket No. 93.-253. The FCC adopted a series of general policies with respect to the kinds of auctions it would hold. These policies dictate different sales procedures for different situations.

Reference-contexts: Off-shore oil lease sales have not allowed such bids. Some farmland sales do ([20]) . As described by McCurdy <ref> [15] </ref> and Rothkopf [19], the divestiture process for synthetic rubber plant units was originally crafted by Congress without such bids, but when Shell Chemical Company under McCurdy submitted a single bid for three units that exceeded the sum of bids from others for those units, Congress voted to accept the Shell

Reference-contexts: In off-shore oil-lease bidding, this dependency often takes the form of diseconomies of scale. (The diseconomies of scale are due to risks associated with the extreme variability of returns and the large amounts of money involved. See <ref> [18] </ref> for a discussion of bidding in simultaneous auctions with a constraint on exposure, i.e. the total of all bids. <p> The Broadband MTA auctions began with daily rounds but primarily proceeded at a two-rounds-per-day pace. - 3 - 3 Additional Background The Auction Design Problem Only a few scholarly papers consider the auction design problems introduced by value interdependencies among different items for sale. Rothkopf <ref> [18] </ref> considered the bidder's problem in a simultaneous auction without combinatorial bids when there is an interdependency introduced by a constraint on the total of his or her bids.
