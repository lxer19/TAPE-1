Abstract: The recent growth in use of the World-Wide Web in the Internet has caused a significant increase in the demand placed on Web servers. This increased load results in noticeably longer response times for users. We propose an approach to using multicast in the delivery of Web resources that reduces the load on servers as well as the networks that connect them. We analyze the issues involved in using multicast in the Web, especially those related to routing and addressing, and present an alternative approach to multicast routing that is appropriate for this application. We also describe the design and implementation of a system based on the existing WWW client and server architecture and the multicast support provided within IP. Experimental results from this implementation are presented.

Reference-contexts: For this application it is possible to exploit the fact that the server knows the addresses of all the desired destination group members. This information enables the use of a multidesti-nation routing approach. This approach is described by Dalal for implementing broadcast [10] and proposed for IP by Aguilar <ref> [1] </ref>. When using a multidestination routing approach there is no need for the group setup and management overhead associated with the current MBONE multicast routing. The proposed multidestination routing approach uses the options field of the IP protocol header to carry the individual destination addresses for each multicast packet. <p> For all destinations that would be reached through a given interface, a single copy of the packet is made with just those destinations listed in the options header. An algorithm for this routing function is presented in Figure 8. This algorithm is based on Aguilar's proposal <ref> [1] </ref> with one notable exception. In the case where multiple destinations reside on the same subnetwork, our approach transmits a separate unicast IP packet to each destination. This simplifies the router implementation and eliminates the need for a multicast address. and four addresses listed in the options field.

Measurement of our BDIS implementation showed significant improvement in the number of clients that a server can support for the same level of quality of service. <p> Note that each request in the queue for a hot page may represent multiple clients waiting for a response.

Reference-contexts: A variation of the DVMRP scheme allows for more efficient routing by pruning the parts of the network that should not receive packets destined to particular multicast addresses.

Reference-contexts: Web clients typically support several different protocols or access methods for communicating with servers. The most common access method for current web resources is the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) <ref> [6] </ref>. This work considers only those resources accessed using HTTP. HTTP is a connection-oriented transaction protocol for accessing and manipulating documents in hypertext as well as other formats. HTTP is designed to utilize a reliable, connection-oriented transport protocol (TCP) for the transfer of infor 3 mation between Web systems.

Reference-contexts: In the Web, typical requests include the access or update of files on a server host or the execution of a program. By far the most predominant access request is for the read-only retrieval of Web pages. Web resources are identified by their Universal Resource Locators (URLs) <ref> [7] </ref> which identify a server and a path to the file, or page, representing the resource being requested. Web clients typically support several different protocols or access methods for communicating with servers. The most common access method for current web resources is the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [6]. <p> The Page Address field is a number from 0-255 that is assigned based on the pathname of the page being accessed. This pathname is equivalent to the url-path portion of the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) used to access this page <ref> [7] </ref>. This character string is hashed into an eight bit number to generate the address. In our current implementation we use a simple additive hash function that calculates the sum of the ASCII values modulo eight. This scheme reserves 256 addresses to each of 256 different servers.

Reference-contexts: For this we use a protocol that we developed in our group [31]. This protocol is, in turn, built around the IP multicast capabilities supported in the Internet Multicast Backbone (MBONE) <ref> [8] </ref>. In such an environment, the multicast group formed by the clients requesting the same page needs to be identified by a single multicast IP address and all the clients need to explicitly join that group. We discuss how this is accomplished shortly.

Reference-contexts: There is significant ongoing research related to the performance of WWW systems. The most popular approach to addressing the server load problem is to introduce replicated caching servers at the most popular Web sites. Claffy and Braun have analyzed the benefits of caching in the Mosaic server at NCSA <ref> [9] </ref>. Padmanabhan and Mogul have proposed mechanisms to reduce the latency associated with HTTP communications by removing the overhead of creating a new connection for every HTTP request [26]. Sedayao studied the Mosaic related traffic on a large corporate network and presented several issues to consider when deploying Mosaic [30]. <p> We have observed similar skewed request patterns on two other popular servers located on the Georgia Tech network. Similarly, Claffy and Braun describe results showing that the top 25 documents (.27%) on the NCSA Mosaic server account for 59% of the document requests <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In order to minimize bandwidth cost it is important that the multicast traffic is only delivered to networks that have interested clients. A multicast routing protocol proposed for the Internet and in use in the MBONE is a variation of reverse path forwarding <ref> [10] </ref> known as the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) [14, 13]. In its simplest version this protocol would broadcast all mul-ticast messages and rely on end routers to discard packets if they know of no end-users that should receive them. Clearly, this form of multicast is wasteful of bandwidth. <p> For this application it is possible to exploit the fact that the server knows the addresses of all the desired destination group members. This information enables the use of a multidesti-nation routing approach. This approach is described by Dalal for implementing broadcast <ref> [10] </ref> and proposed for IP by Aguilar [1]. When using a multidestination routing approach there is no need for the group setup and management overhead associated with the current MBONE multicast routing.

Reference-contexts: This step should also involve notifying the local router of the requested group membership. For example, the client could send an IGMP Host-Report message to the router <ref> [11] </ref>. 3. Send query to server: The client sends the request to the server. This is done using the current connection request model of HTTP. Along with the request message the client sends an indication that it will support a multicast response for this query. 4.

Other proposed multicast routing protocols for the Internet include Core Based Trees [5] and Protocol Independent Multicasting (PIM) <ref> [12] </ref>. These protocols promise more bandwidth-efficient multicast routing. Time to Join: Another issue to consider with multicast routing protocols is the time lag between the point where a host requests to join a group and the point where it is able to receive messages sent to the group. <p> Also, the WWW server knows the addresses of all the receiving group members; this is not necessarily the case for all multicast applications. The current MBONE routing protocols, DVMRP [13, 14] and the proposed PIM <ref> [12] </ref> alternatives, are designed to support the traditional multicast applications and are not necessarily ideal for a resource delivery application. For this application it is possible to exploit the fact that the server knows the addresses of all the desired destination group members. <p> Router 3 has two destinations attached to the same subnet. The router makes two copies and sends the message to the hosts via unicast. When compared to current IP datagram forwarding, this approach requires additional router overhead to forward multidestination traffic. However, unlike other multicast routing approaches <ref> [12, 14] </ref>, routers do not need to store any additional state. The current unicast routing information is sufficient for determining the route for multidestination packets. The route taken for the multidestination traffic is a shortest-path tree from the source, based on current unicast routing information.

Reference-contexts: The route taken for the multidestination traffic is a shortest-path tree from the source, based on current unicast routing information. While this does not guarantee the minimum number of packet copies, this approach has been shown to perform reasonably well in typical networks <ref> [15] </ref>. This approach reduces the network packet counts to no more than one copy per intermediate network.

Reference-contexts: At heavily loaded servers, it is expected that within any given short period of time, many requests for the same hot page are likely to be made. New Web features like server push <ref> [21] </ref> and Ubique's virtual places will likely lead to further synchronization of clients that are concurrently receiving the same pages. The server's multicast response, therefore, has the potential of allowing the server to satisfy many requests with a single transmission; and consequently reducing the server load.

Handling this port number mismatch requires the use of some mapping of the group port number to the individual port numbers at the receivers.

Reference-contexts: In the same way that an HTTP connection is built on top of a TCP connection, the multicast response connection needs to be built on top of a reliable multicast transport protocol. For this we use a protocol that we developed in our group <ref> [31] </ref>. This protocol is, in turn, built around the IP multicast capabilities supported in the Internet Multicast Backbone (MBONE) [8]. <p> This new connection is established by creating a new socket and then calling the connect () system call. In our implementation (see Section 6), the reliable multicast protocol is a working prototype of the Single Connection Emulation (SCE) architecture described in <ref> [31] </ref>. 12 5.3 Interaction with Multicast Routing Bandwidth Consumption: By multicasting responses we are able to satisfy multiple client requests with a single transmission from the server. This clearly saves on server resources and allows it to handle a heavier request load.
