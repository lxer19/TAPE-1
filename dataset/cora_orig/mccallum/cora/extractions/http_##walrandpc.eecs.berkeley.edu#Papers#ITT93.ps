Abstract: We derive the relative entropy between two Markov transition rate matrices from sample path considerations. This relative entropy is interpreted as a "level 2.5" large deviations action functional. That is, the level two large deviations action functional for empirical distributions of continuous-time Markov chains can be derived from the relative entropy using the contraction mapping principle [4].
