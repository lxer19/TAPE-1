Abstract: We present several results regarding randomized one-round communication complexity. Our results include a connection to the VC-dimension, a study of the problem of computing the inner product of two real valued vectors, and a relation between "simultaneous" protocols and one-round protocols.

Reference-contexts: We allow them bounded, two-sided error. We study very simple types of protocols which include only one round of communication. These protocols were introduced by Yao in his original communication complexity paper [Yao79] and were later studied by several authors (cf. <ref> [PM84, Abl93, NS96] </ref>; For a general survey on communication complexity see [KN95]).

Reference-contexts: However, when only private coins are allowed, the communication complexity of the problem changes dramatically. Recent results [NS96, BW96, BK96] (that are briefly discussed in Subsection 1.3) imply that R jj (IN P 2;2 ) = ( n) (and this bound is tight <ref> [Amb94, Nao94, New94, NS96] </ref>). We also present an interesting application of the above theorems. Let B n 1 , B n 1 , be the sets of n-dimensional real vectors whose L 1 , L 2 , and L 1 norm, respectively, is bounded by 1. <p> In contrast, in the private-coin simultaneous model we have the following proposition. Proposition 4.1 R jj (IN P 2;2 ) = fi ( p Proof: The upper bound follows from the application of a general upper bound <ref> [Amb94, Nao94, New94] </ref> (see [NS96]) which asserts that R jj (f ) = O ( p n R jj;pub (f )), where we get from Theorem 8 and Theorem 10 that R jj;pub (IN P 2;2 ) = O (1). (Though the upper bound in [NS96] was stated only for boolean <p> 2), implies that every randomized 1-round private-coin protocol can be transformed into a protocol in which Bob is deterministic while incurring small additional error and cost. 16 previously, there is a general transformation from simultaneous public-coin protocols to simultane-ous private-coin protocols at a multiplicative cost of O ( p n) <ref> [Amb94, Nao94, New94, NS96] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This complexity we denote by R jj (f ). In this paper we consider three main questions. 1.1 The VC-Dimension and a related Combinatorial Dimension We first observe the (surprising) fact that the VC-dimension <ref> [VC71, BEHW89] </ref> of a function class, f X , defined by the set of rows of the matrix associated with f (denoted by V C-dim (f X )), provides a lower bound on R A!B (f ). <p> If f is a real valued function then a related combinatorial dimension which is a parameterized version of the pseudo-dimension gives similar bounds. 3.1 Boolean Functions We start by recalling the definition of the VC-dimension <ref> [VC71, BEHW89] </ref>. Definition 3.1 Let H be class of boolean functions over a domain Y . <p> u j = i=0 d ! = 2 d (log (4e)=4) &lt; 2 :861d : (2) Thus, X u If d 15 then the claim follows. (Lemma 3.1 and R A!B;[] * (f ) = (d).) * (f ) = O (d): For this claim we need the following theorem <ref> [BEHW89] </ref>, which is one of the most fundamental theorems in computational learning theory. Theorem [BEHW89] Let H be class of boolean functions over a domain Y with VC-dimension d, let be an arbitrary probability distribution over Y , and let 0 &lt; *; ffi &lt; 1. <p> : (2) Thus, X u If d 15 then the claim follows. (Lemma 3.1 and R A!B;[] * (f ) = (d).) * (f ) = O (d): For this claim we need the following theorem <ref> [BEHW89] </ref>, which is one of the most fundamental theorems in computational learning theory. Theorem [BEHW89] Let H be class of boolean functions over a domain Y with VC-dimension d, let be an arbitrary probability distribution over Y , and let 0 &lt; *; ffi &lt; 1.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, IN P par 1;1 is complete for the class of (boolean) functions whose one-round randomized complexity is polylog (n). Here completeness is under rectangular reductions as introduced by Babai, Frankl, and Simon <ref> [BFS86] </ref>. It should be noted that the reduction we use was implicit in [Yao79]. The second case we consider is one in which k~xk 2 1 and k~yk 2 1, where k~xk 2 = p P Again, this ensures that j~x ~yj 1. <p> It is interesting to note that though it is known that even for multi-round communication complexity R (DISJ) = (n), [KS92, Raz90], the upper bound on multi-round rectangular distributional complexity is lower <ref> [BFS86] </ref>: R [] (DISJ) = O ( p n log (n)). Thus, our example shows a quadratic gap between R A!B;[] (f ), and R [] (f ) (for f = DISJ). <p> It is interesting to note that in the case of multi-round communication complexity there are only examples showing a polynomial (quadratic) gap between R [] (f ) and R (f ) <ref> [BFS86, KS92, Raz90] </ref>. Theorem 6 There exists a function f for which R A!B;[] (f ) = O (1), while R A!B (f ) = (n). <p> First we need to define completeness in this context. This is done using rectangular reductions, which were introduced in <ref> [BFS86] </ref>. Definition 4.1 Let X; X 0 ; Y; Y 0 and Z be arbitrary sets. Let f : X fi Y ! Z, and let f 0 : X 0 fi Y 0 ! Z.

Reference-contexts: Let R A!B;[] * (f ) denote max D A!B; * (f ), where the maximum is taken over all product distributions. Finally, we shall need the following (slight) variation of a theorem of Newman <ref> [New91] </ref>, which gives an upper bound on private-coin complexity in terms of public-coin complexity.

Z be a function whose randomized communication complexity we would like to study. <p> In order to get the upper bound on R A!B (IN P 2;2 ), we apply Newman's theorem <ref> [New91] </ref>, quoted in Theorem 2. Though the theorem is not directly applicable in our case since it applies to functions defined on finite domains X and Y , we need only make the following observation. <p> The second claim follows from: (1) The upper bound R A!B;pub (IN P 2;2 ) = R B!A;pub (IN P 2;2 ) = O (1) stated in Theorem 8; (2) The lower bound R B!A (IN P par 1;1 ) = (n) stated in Theorem 7 combined with Newman's theorem <ref> [New91] </ref>, ( stated in Theorem 2) which imply that R B!A;pub (IN P 1;1 ) R B!A (IN P 1;1 ) O (log (n)) = (n) Given the constant upper bound on IN P 2;2 , such a pair of mappings would clearly contradict the linear lower bound on IN P <p> The existence of such a multiplicative ( p n) gap between public-coin and private-coin communication complexity in the simultaneous model should be contrasted with the worst case O (log (n)) additive difference between public-coin and private-coin one-round communication complexity <ref> [New91] </ref>.

(Though the upper bound in [NS96] was stated only for boolean functions, it also holds in our case, since we are only varying the definition of correctness (or success) of a protocol on inputs, and this is irrelevant to the proof.)

Reference-contexts: This complexity we denote by R jj (f ). In this paper we consider three main questions. 1.1 The VC-Dimension and a related Combinatorial Dimension We first observe the (surprising) fact that the VC-dimension <ref> [VC71, BEHW89] </ref> of a function class, f X , defined by the set of rows of the matrix associated with f (denoted by V C-dim (f X )), provides a lower bound on R A!B (f ). <p> If f is a real valued function then a related combinatorial dimension which is a parameterized version of the pseudo-dimension gives similar bounds. 3.1 Boolean Functions We start by recalling the definition of the VC-dimension <ref> [VC71, BEHW89] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper we are concerned with randomized two-party communication complexity as defined by Yao <ref> [Yao79] </ref>: Alice holds an input x, Bob holds an input y, and they wish to compute a given function f (x; y), to which end they communicate with each other via a randomized protocol. We allow them bounded, two-sided error. <p> We allow them bounded, two-sided error. We study very simple types of protocols which include only one round of communication. These protocols were introduced by Yao in his original communication complexity paper <ref> [Yao79] </ref> and were later studied by several authors (cf. [PM84, Abl93, NS96]; For a general survey on communication complexity see [KN95]). <p> Clearly, the second variant is no harder than the first. We first study the case in which k~xk 1 1 and k~yk 1 1, where k~xk 1 = P max i jy i j. (This of course ensures that j~x ~yj 1.) In his original paper <ref> [Yao79] </ref>, Yao actually defined the one-round randomized communication complexity of functions in terms of the inner product of such pairs of vectors. <p> Furthermore, IN P par 1;1 is complete for the class of (boolean) functions whose one-round randomized complexity is polylog (n). Here completeness is under rectangular reductions as introduced by Babai, Frankl, and Simon [BFS86]. It should be noted that the reduction we use was implicit in <ref> [Yao79] </ref>. The second case we consider is one in which k~xk 2 1 and k~yk 2 1, where k~xk 2 = p P Again, this ensures that j~x ~yj 1. <p> Next, we describe a rectangular reduction from any given f : X fi Y ! f0; 1g for which R A!B (f ) = polylog (n), to IN P par 1;1 . As noted in the introduction, this reduction was implicit in <ref> [Yao79] </ref>. If R A!B (f ) = polylog (n) then there exists a 1-round communication protocol P for f with error 1=4 that has the following properties. <p> It then follows that R A!B (DISJ) R (DISJ) = (log (n)), contradicting our assumption on the 1-round randomized communication complexity of IN P 2;2 . For this we need the following definition of a fooling set <ref> [Yao79, LS81] </ref>.
