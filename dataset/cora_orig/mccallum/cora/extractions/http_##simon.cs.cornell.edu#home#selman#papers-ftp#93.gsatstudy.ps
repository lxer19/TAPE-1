Abstract: GSAT is a randomized local search procedure for solving propositional satisfiability problems. GSAT can solve hard, randomly generated problems that are an order of magnitude larger than those that can be handled by more traditional approaches, such as the Davis-Putnam procedure. This paper presents the results of numerous experiments we have performed with GSAT, in order to improve our understanding of its capabilities and limitations. We first characterize the space traversed by GSAT. We will see that for nearly all problem classes we have encountered, the space consists of a steep descent followed by broad flat plateaus. We then compare GSAT with simulated annealing, and show how GSAT can be viewed as an efficient method for executing the low-temperature tail of an annealing schedule. Finally, we report on extensions to the basic GSAT procedure. We discuss two general, domain-independent extensions that dramatically improve GSAT's performance on structured problems: the use of clause weights, and a way to average in near-solutions when initializing the procedure before each try. This papers appears in the Proceedings of the Eleventh National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-93), Washington, D.C., 1993.

Reference-contexts: To overcome asymmetries, we added a weight to each clause (constraint). 6 A 5 We thank Geoffrey Hinton and Hector Levesque for suggesting this strategy to us. The strategy has some of the flavor of the approaches found in genetic algorithms <ref> (Davis 1987) </ref>. 6 Morris (1993) has independently proposed a similar approach. 10 weight is a positive integer, indicating how often the clause should be counted when determining which variable to flip next.

Reference-contexts: It can be shown formally that provided one cools slowly enough, the system will find a global minimum. Unfortunately, the analysis uses an exponentially long annealing schedule, making it only of theoretical interest <ref> (Hajek 1988) </ref>. Our real interest is in the rate of convergence to a global minimum for more practical annealing schedules.

Reference-contexts: Selman et al. also showed that GSAT performs well on propositional encodings of the N-queens problem, hard instances of graph coloring problems <ref> (Johnson et al. 1991) </ref>, and Boolean induction problems (Kamath et al. 1992). 3 The Search Space Crucial to a better understanding of GSAT's behavior is the manner in which GSAT converges on an assignment. <p> In fact, we were unable to find an annealing schedule that performed better than GSAT, although we cannot rule out the possiblity that such a schedule exists. This is an inherent difficulty in the study of annealing approaches <ref> (Johnson et al. 1991) </ref>. 8 4 Extensions The basic GSAT algorithm is quite elementary, and one might expect that more sophisticated algorithms could yield better performance. We investigated several extensions to GSAT, and found a few that were indeed successful.

Reference-contexts: In fact, Ginsberg and Jonsson (1992) supplied us with some graph coloring problems that GSAT could not solve, even with many tries each with many flips. Their dependency-directed backtracking method could find solutions to these problems with little effort <ref> (Jonsson and Ginsberg 1993) </ref>. In running GSAT on these problems, we discovered that at the end of almost every try the same set of clauses remained unsatisfied. As it turns out, the problems contained strong asymmetries.

In Figure 2, we show how the GSAT's search progresses on a randomly generated 100 variable problem with 430 clauses.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the theoretical analysis of general greedy local search presented in <ref> (Minton et al. 1992) </ref> shows that the closer the initial assignment is to a solution, the more likely it is that local search will succeed. Therefore we tried the following method for creating better initial assignments: First, a variable is assigned a random value.

Reference-contexts: A literal is a propositional variable or its negation. A set of clauses corresponds to a formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF): a conjunction of disjunctions. Thus, GSAT handles CNF-SAT. 3 GSAT mimics the standard local search procedures used for finding approx-imate solutions to optimization problems <ref> (Papadimitriou and Steiglitz 1982) </ref> in that it only explores potential solutions that are close to the one currently being considered. Specifically, we explore the set of assignments that differ from the current one on only one variable.
