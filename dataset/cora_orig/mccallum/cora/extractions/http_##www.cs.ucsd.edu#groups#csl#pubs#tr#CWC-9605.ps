Reference-contexts: When a MH moves to a new network, this state is sent from the old FA to the new one, so that delivery can proceed from the point where it was interrupted by the move <ref> [1] </ref>. All FAs that serve MHs belonging to a particular group form a group themselves, and it is only these FAs that need to co-operate to ensure exactly once semantics for the group [2].

Reference-contexts: All FAs that serve MHs belonging to a particular group form a group themselves, and it is only these FAs that need to co-operate to ensure exactly once semantics for the group <ref> [2] </ref>. Although exactly once semantics are required for many distributed algorithms, IP offers unreliable service in the unicast case, so IP multicasting extensions have concentrated on providing the same type of service in the multicast case. For this reason, we did not include exactly once mechanisms in the previous discussion.

Reference-contexts: We have discussed in Section 2 the proposed standard, but an earlier mechanism has been implemented and used widely for experimentation [14]. Although this mechanism is becoming obsolete with the emergence of a standard, its interaction with mul-ticasting has been studied <ref> [3] </ref> and some interesting solutions have been proposed. In the remainder of this 11 section we describe briefly the Columbia Mobile IP protocol and the proposed modifications to it for multi--casting support to give another perspective on the problems that mobility poses for multicasting and how these may be solved. <p> Although it is not appropriate to compare these mechanisms with previous ones, as they are based on a different set of assumptions about the mobility model at hand, we can evaluate this proposal using the criteria of Section 6.4. The modification scale is minor, as shown in <ref> [3] </ref>, as the only additional mechanism is the relaying of encapsulated multicasts to all MSRs using existing IP multicasting mechanisms. Modified entities are only the MSRs, which combine the functionality of FAs and MHs in the standard proposal.

Reference-contexts: Again, to reduce routing table sizes, routers only keep track of networks, for both senders and receivers. With MOSPF, datagrams are only propagated when actually needed, a marked improvement over DVMRP. The last proposal, Core Based Trees (CBT) <ref> [4] </ref>, employs a single tree for each group rather than one tree per source-destination pair. A router called the core is chosen in an ad hoc way for each group, and all multicast datagrams are initially sent there.

Reference-contexts: The first reason for this interest is the ease of addressing services with a single identifier: members of a multicast group are addressed collectively by single datagrams. In this sense, multicasting can enable resource location services <ref> [5] </ref> and ease the use of distributed and replicated ones. The second reason for the interest in multicasting is its potential for economizing on bandwidth. <p> The third approach is a hybrid, so both home and foreign networks are local for the MH. Note that support for local multicasting on the foreign network is very useful for MHs, since it can be used for resource and configuration server discovery purposes <ref> [5] </ref>. It should be clear that the third approach could be eliminated from consideration for most real situations, as only under very contrived conditions its poor interoperability and suboptimal performance will be justifiable or, at least, unavoidable.

Reference-contexts: However, its importance can be seen in the fact that the requirements for the next version of IP (IPv6) emphasize multicasting support and encourage the replacement of broadcasting with multicasting whenever possible <ref> [16, 6] </ref>. The first reason for this interest is the ease of addressing services with a single identifier: members of a multicast group are addressed collectively by single datagrams.

Reference-contexts: of when a MH should be assumed absent from the wireless network and how initial contact is established among the FA and the MH for registration purposes, are beyond the scope of this paper. 3 IP Multicasting The IP multicasting model is based on the concept of the host group <ref> [7] </ref>: a dynamic set of hosts identified by a class D IP address. A host can join or leave a host group at any time, in order to start or stop receiving datagrams sent to the group. Sending datagrams to a host group is not limited to group members.

Reference-contexts: Third, multiple tunnels are required from each separate HA to its MHs even when the same multicast datagrams are tunneled, leading to the tunnel convergence problem <ref> [8] </ref>. When multiple tunnels exist, originating either from the same or from different HAs, the encapsulated datagrams are also unicast multiple times over the wireless medium, which is the most bandwidth limited part of the virtual PtP links. <p> choice between normal and join/leave IGMP messages can be made at registration time, with the MH indicating which modes it can support and the FA choosing the appropriate one. 6.3 Combined Routing A last approach for receiving multicasts mixes tunneling from the HA with local multicast service from the FA <ref> [8] </ref>. Tunnels are dynamically set up from the HAs, but to avoid duplication and convergence, the FA gathers membership information locally and arranges for a unique tunnel for each required group from a single HA.

Reference-contexts: mechanisms into local , which deal with group membership management and local datagram delivery, and global, which deal with multicast routing from senders towards any interested local networks. 3.1 Local Multicasting Mechanisms Locating hosts belonging to a dynamic multicast group is the task of the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) <ref> [9] </ref>. Each local network supporting IP multicasting has one router designated as the group manager. This router periodically sends queries for group membership in its local area, and its attached hosts reply with messages identifying the groups they want to participate in.

Reference-contexts: The router will keep track of what groups each MH is currently a member of and update its state when a new join or leave message 4 Another proposal, Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) <ref> [10] </ref>, combines core based and shortest path trees, depending on receiver requirements. 4 arrives, or when the MH leaves the area; then all MH state is deleted. Essentially, the proposed join and leave IGMP messages specify the difference between the existing and the new state of the MH.

Reference-contexts: We will briefly outline the three generic approaches that have been proposed for multicast routing over IP networks. The earliest routing mechanism was the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) <ref> [11] </ref>, based on the Reverse Path Broadcasting (RPB) [12] algorithm. The main idea of this algorithm is that each multicast router keeps track of the first links of the best paths to sources of multicast datagrams.

Reference-contexts: When datagrams arrive at the tunnel destination, they are decapsulated and continue their journey towards their destination. These tunnels are essentially virtual links, and the collection of multicast aware areas connected by them is a virtual network overlaid on the worldwide Internet, known as the MBone <ref> [13] </ref>. In IP, datagram delivery is limited by the time to live (TTL) field, which is usually implemented as a limit to the hops that a datagram can make before it is destroyed.

Reference-contexts: We present our conclusions in Section 8. 2 IP Mobility The goal of IP mobility support is to allow a mobile host (MH) to change its point of attachment to the network without losing connectivity, transparently to transport layer protocols <ref> [14] </ref>. Internet transport layer protocols (TCP/UDP) however assume that a host's address is fixed. Mobile IP provides a mechanism for a MH to retain one address, called its home address, as it roams around the network. <p> On the other hand, given the semantics of IP multicasting and mobile IP as we have described them previously, there exist alternative mechanisms to support mobility. We have discussed in Section 2 the proposed standard, but an earlier mechanism has been implemented and used widely for experimentation <ref> [14] </ref>. Although this mechanism is becoming obsolete with the emergence of a standard, its interaction with mul-ticasting has been studied [3] and some interesting solutions have been proposed.

Reference-contexts: Essentially, the proposed join and leave IGMP messages specify the difference between the existing and the new state of the MH. This is a variation on header compression <ref> [15] </ref>, customized for IGMP. While with standard IGMP one query and multiple responses per time interval (as many as the groups a MH belongs to) are needed, with the new approach only one message per join and leave operation is required, regardless of the duration of group membership.

Reference-contexts: Since virtual links seem like a single hop but are in reality longer paths, multicast routers attach TTL thresholds to tunnels to limit multicast delivery based on locality. A second proposal, the Multicast Open Shortest Path First (MOSPF) <ref> [19, 18, 17] </ref> protocol, is based on the OSPF protocol which uses a link state algorithm. In OSPF, each router floods information about its adjacent links throughout the network, so that all routers know the complete topology.

Reference-contexts: There are two problems with this approach. First, datagrams to the MH are always routed via its HA, resulting in suboptimal triangle routing , as shown in Figure 1. Proposed extensions rectify this problem <ref> [21, 20] </ref>, but their applicability and performance in a wide area network remain unclear. Second, the registration process has no de-registration counterpart, as the MH may lose connectivity with the FA at any time, due to movement. <p> To deliver datagrams from an arbitrary sender to a dynamic set of receivers, we need mechanisms to: 1.
