Reference-contexts: This will require any critical data (e.g., database logs, process checkpoint) to be stored elsewhere other than the mobile computer. This in turn will impact performance of protocols (e.g., recovery protocols) that require these critical data <ref> [1, 48, 65] </ref>. * Disconnections : Mobile units run on batteries; with limited capacity [20, 31]. Limitations in battery power and bandwidth make disconnections from the network very frequent. Disconnections have various degrees depending on bandwidth availability. Because of their frequency, disconnections must be treated differently than failures or crashes. <p> It has been pointed out [3] that while the disk storage on a static host is stable, the stability of any storage on a mobile host is questionable, for reasons such as dropping of laptops or effect of airport security systems <ref> [1] </ref>. Thus, a mobile host's disk storage cannot 12 be considered stable and is vulnerable to failures. Moreover, all mobile hosts are not necessarily equipped with disk storage. Thus, we need the stable storage to be located on a static host. <p> The protocol also tolerates the corruption of these logical 15 timestamps. Lin [52], studies the recovery of mobility databases at the visitor location register (V LR) and home location register (HLR) for personal communication networks. Schemes with and without checkpointing are described and analyzed. Acharya et.al. <ref> [1] </ref>, identify the problems with checkpointing mobile distributed applications, presenting an algorithm for recording global checkpoints for distributed applications running on mobile hosts. In this research, however, we consider protocols to recover from failure in a mobile host, independent of other hosts in the system.

Reference-contexts: B. Related Work Research in mobile computing primarily has focussed on mobility management, database system issues, network protocols, disconnected operation and distributed algorithms for mobile hosts [20, 31]. Work on fault-tolerance issues is very limited. Alagar et.al. <ref> [2] </ref>, demonstrate schemes to tolerate base station failures by replicating the information stored at a base station, at several "secondary" base stations. Strategies for selecting the secondary base stations were shown.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, disks provide large amounts of stable (non-volatile) storage. However, in a mobile computer, disks are a liability. This is because, they consume more 5 power than memory chips. Moreover, they may not really be nonvolatile when subject to the harsh environment that a portable computer faces <ref> [3] </ref>. This will require any critical data (e.g., database logs, process checkpoint) to be stored elsewhere other than the mobile computer. <p> Some of the differences between static and mobile networks are enumerated in Table I. Traditional fault-tolerance schemes like checkpointing and message logging [38, 64] require a stable storage for saving the checkpoint and the logs. It has been pointed out <ref> [3] </ref> that while the disk storage on a static host is stable, the stability of any storage on a mobile host is questionable, for reasons such as dropping of laptops or effect of airport security systems [1]. <p> State-Saving State-saving strategies presented in this chapter are based on traditional checkpoint-ing and message-logging techniques. In such strategies, the host periodically saves its state at a stable storage. Thus, upon failure of the host, execution can be restarted from the last-saved checkpoint. It was indicated earlier <ref> [3] </ref> that a mobile host's disk storage cannot be considered stable.

Reference-contexts: Fowler deals with techniques to efficiently use forwarding addresses for finding decentralized 45 objects. Our research borrows the idea of manipulating forwarding pointers upon a successful search. Awerbuch et.al. proposed a theoretical model for online tracking of mobile hosts <ref> [4] </ref>. Their architecture consists of a hierarchy of "m-regional matching directories". In their scheme, forwarding pointers and regional matching directories are used to enable localized updates and searches. Spreitzer et.al. proposed a network architecture which consists of user agents and a location query service (LQS) [72].

Reference-contexts: However, these protocols are primarily proposed for a campus environment with mobile computers. Badrinath et.al. examine strategies that reduce search costs and control the volume of location updates by employing user profiles <ref> [5] </ref>. Their architecture consists 46 of a hierarchy of location servers which are connected to themselves and to the base stations (or mobile support stations) by a static network. User profiles are used to create partitions. It is only when the user crosses partitions that the update takes place.

Reference-contexts: Classification of Mobile Wireless Networks Mobile wireless networks can be classified broadly into two types : Infrastructure networks and Dynamic networks. 1. Infrastructure Networks Infrastructure networks are two tiered networks composed of a static backbone network and peripheral wireless networks <ref> [9, 51, 58] </ref>. The static network comprises of fixed hosts and communication links between them. Some of the fixed hosts, called mobile support stations (MSS) 1 are augmented with a wireless interface, and, they provide a gateway for communication between the wireless network and the static network. <p> BER in wireless links is of the order of 10 2 to 10 6 , and they are highly sensitive to the direction of propagation, multipath fading, and other interference <ref> [9, 51] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Conventional routing protocols can be broadly classified as distance vector and link state protocols. Distance vector routing uses the classical distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm <ref> [11, 30, 40, 55] </ref>. Each host maintains for each destination a set of distances through each of its neighbors. In order to maintain up-to-date information, each host periodically broadcasts to each of its neighbors, its current estimate of the shortest path to every other host in the network. <p> Host h will then follow the procedure for host disappearance as explained in Section C.2. E. Performance Evaluation 1. Complexity This section compares the cluster-based approach's worst-case performance with the performance of Distributed Bellman-Ford (DBF) <ref> [11] </ref>, Ideal Link State (ILS) [25], Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) [25], NP [16] and flooding. The ILS protocol [25] requires that each topology change be transmitted to every node. The DUAL protocol [25] is a distance-vector loop-free algorithm based on internodal coordination spanning multiple hops. <p> The other boundary nodes are considered as non-boundary nodes. The procedure to select a boundary node has been described in Section C. * x: Number of nodes affected by the topological change. * l: Diameter of the affected network segment. Table XII.

Reference-contexts: The mobile host then loads the latest state and resumes operation. Importantly, need for frequent transmission of state on the wireless link is a limiting factor for this scheme. * Logging Approach (denoted as L): This approach is rooted in "pessimistic" logging <ref> [13] </ref>, used in static systems. In this scheme, a mobile host checkpoints its state periodically. To facilitate recovery, the write events that take place in the interval 17 between checkpoints are also logged.

Mobility is an important new component that will have far-reaching consequences for system design. <p> During a handoff period, there are no packets sent or received by the mobile host. Thus, if handoff time is very high, the communication protocols used for these connection-oriented services might timeout and/or the mobile host might notice long disruption in service during handoffs <ref> [14] </ref>. Some applications might require a very quick recovery, and some other applications might require a very low total cost to be incurred by the recovery schemes. Some hosts might be running the application in a high failure rate environment, and some in a very low failure rate environment.

Reference-contexts: Cutting-edge products for portable wireless communications achieve only 2 Mbps for local area networks [20]. The bandwidth availability in wide area wireless networks are much lower; in the order of tens of Kbps (e.g., 19.2 Kbps for Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) networks <ref> [15] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The mobile hosts also have the capability to forward (relay) packets. Examples of such networks are ad-hoc wireless local area 1 Mobile support stations are also called base stations. 3 networks [17, 39, 47, 61] and packet radio networks <ref> [16, 40, 42, 59] </ref>. The term ad-hoc network is in conformance with current usage within the IEEE 802.11 subcommittee [17]. Example applications of such networks range from conference rooms to battlefields. <p> In dynamic networks, mobility of hosts causes the network topology to change. This in turn complicates the design of routing protocols in such networks <ref> [16, 39, 47, 59, 61] </ref>. Mobility also affects the design of applications. In a client-server environment, mobile clients may find themselves far away from their servers; servers may also move further away from their clients. <p> Introduction A dynamic network composes of a set of mobile hosts that can communicate with each other over the wireless links (direct or indirect) without any static network interaction. Example of such networks are ad-hoc networks [17, 39, 61], and packet radio networks <ref> [16, 40, 42] </ref>. An important issue in dynamic networks is the design and analysis of routing schemes. This chapter investigates the consequence of mobility and disconnections of mobile hosts on the design and performance of routing protocol in a dynamic network. <p> A loop-free routing protocol for dynamic networks is proposed in [22]. Routing optimality is of secondary importance. Rather, their goal is to maintain connectivity between the hosts in a fast changing topology. A distributed routing protocol for mobile packet radio networks is proposed by Corson et al. <ref> [16] </ref>. Similar to [22], routing optimality is of secondary importance. Instead of maintaining distances from all sources to a destination, the protocol guarantees route maintenance only for those sources that actually desire routes. This property helps in reducing the topology update overhead. <p> This process goes on till the message packet reaches the intended destination. This happens provided the destination is connected to the node which originated the flood <ref> [16] </ref>. 2 Loop-free routing requires prevention of loops in the routing tables. Here, existence of temporary loops are not of concern. 127 routing protocol adapts in a distributed fashion to arbitrary changes in topology in the absence of global topological knowledge. <p> Such a host will be represented in the graph by a disconnected node. A host H v1 is connected to another host H v2 if there exists at least one path from node v1 to v2. Similar to <ref> [16, 59] </ref>, an underlying link-level protocol is assumed which assures the following: * A node is aware of all its neighbors at all times. * All packets transmitted over a link are received correctly and in proper sequence within a finite time. * All control messages are processed one at a <p> Host h will then follow the procedure for host disappearance as explained in Section C.2.

The ILS protocol [25] requires that each topology change be transmitted to every node. The DUAL protocol [25] is a distance-vector loop-free algorithm based on internodal coordination spanning multiple hops. DUAL is known to be the lowest complexity distance-vector 150 algorithm.

Thus, a compromise on routing optimality as suggested in <ref> [16] </ref> to avoid network congestion might not be required. Quick reconvergence in some protocols like DSDV [61] is obtained by quick rebroadcast by each and every recipient of the broadcast, causing degradation of the availability of the wireless medium. <p> However, in our approach, re-broadcast is done only by the boundary nodes. Nodes other than boundary nodes just listen and update their tables. Similar to <ref> [16, 22] </ref> the cluster-based approach does not guarantee shortest path. This is due to the fact that the clusters are created using the first-fit approach, which does not produce the maximum clusters in the graph.

Reference-contexts: Thus, if a location server crashes and recovers, the location information (includes forwarding pointers) stored in the volatile memory may be initialized randomly.

Reference-contexts: User profiles are used to create partitions. It is only when the user crosses partitions that the update takes place. However, in most cases, user profiles are not always available a priori. A modified tree structure for location management was proposed in <ref> [19] </ref>. The root and the some of the higher levels of the tree was replaced by a set-ary butterfly network. This helped in balancing the search requests at the nodes. Also proposed were schemes to make the protocol self-stabilizing. <p> Thus, if a location server crashes and recovers, the location information (includes forwarding pointers) stored in the volatile memory may be initialized randomly.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, a wireless capability in a host does not necessarily imply unlimited mobility. There are a number of wireless local area networks (LANs) <ref> [20, 31] </ref> which, although free from the physical constraints of cables, cannot be considered to be WANs because of their limited range of operation. The journal model is IEEE Transactions on Computers. 2 A. <p> A mobile host communicates with one MSS at any given time. MSS is responsible for forwarding data between the mobile host and static network. Communication to and from the mobile host takes place via the static network. An example of infrastructure networks is the new Personal Communication Systems (PCS) <ref> [20, 31] </ref>. 2. Dynamic Networks Dynamic networks consist of mobile hosts which can communicate with each other over the wireless links (direct or indirect) without any static network interaction. In such networks the mobile host has the capability to communicate directly with another mobile host in its vicinity. <p> In the following we list the limitations and challenges. * Wireless Bandwidth: The bandwidth on the wireless medium is much lower than the wired medium. Cutting-edge products for portable wireless communications achieve only 2 Mbps for local area networks <ref> [20] </ref>. The bandwidth availability in wide area wireless networks are much lower; in the order of tens of Kbps (e.g., 19.2 Kbps for Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) networks [15]). <p> This in turn will impact performance of protocols (e.g., recovery protocols) that require these critical data [1, 48, 65]. * Disconnections : Mobile units run on batteries; with limited capacity <ref> [20, 31] </ref>. Limitations in battery power and bandwidth make disconnections from the network very frequent. Disconnections have various degrees depending on bandwidth availability. Because of their frequency, disconnections must be treated differently than failures or crashes. The difference between disconnection and failure is its elective nature. <p> Disconnections have various degrees depending on bandwidth availability. Because of their frequency, disconnections must be treated differently than failures or crashes. The difference between disconnection and failure is its elective nature. Disconnections are to be treated as planned failures which can be anticipated and prepared for <ref> [20, 31, 68] </ref>. Disconnections cause the network topology to change in dynamic networks. This is because the disconnected mobile host can no longer be used for forwarding data. <p> The system model of the infrastructure network is the same as explained in Chapter I. A mobile host may become unavailable due to (i) failure of the mobile host, (ii) disconnection of the mobile host, and (iii) wireless link failure <ref> [20, 31, 48, 65] </ref>. Loss of battery power make disconnections from the network frequent, and sometimes unpredictable. Because of their frequency, disconnections must be treated differently than failures.

The difference between disconnection and failure is its elective nature. User initiated disconnections can be treated as planned failures, which can be anticipated and prepared for <ref> [20, 31, 68] </ref>. The wireless link is equivalent to an intermittently faulty link, which transmits correct messages during fault-free conditions, and stops any transmissions upon a failure. Disconnections and weak wireless links primarily delay the system response, whereas a host failure affects the system state. <p> Section C presents the recovery strategies. Section D gives the performance analysis of the recovery strategies, and summary is found in Section E. B. Related Work Research in mobile computing primarily has focussed on mobility management, database system issues, network protocols, disconnected operation and distributed algorithms for mobile hosts <ref> [20, 31] </ref>. Work on fault-tolerance issues is very limited. Alagar et.al. [2], demonstrate schemes to tolerate base station failures by replicating the information stored at a base station, at several "secondary" base stations. Strategies for selecting the secondary base stations were shown. <p> We analyzed the performance of the various recovery schemes proposed in this chapter, and determined those mobile environments where a particular recovery scheme is best-suited. 42 CHAPTER III CENTRALIZED LOCATION MANAGEMENT A. Introduction It is expected that existing wireless cellular networks will be upgraded for personal communication services (PCS) <ref> [20, 31, 58] </ref>. An important issue in mobile wireless networks is the design and analysis of location management schemes. In order to communicate with any particular user, it is first necessary to locate the user in the network.

Reference-contexts: Summary is presented in Section J. B. Related Work in Location Management Numerous location strategies have been proposed in the recent years. One of the earlier works which dealt with object tracking was done in 1986 by Fowler <ref> [21] </ref>. Fowler deals with techniques to efficiently use forwarding addresses for finding decentralized 45 objects. Our research borrows the idea of manipulating forwarding pointers upon a successful search. Awerbuch et.al. proposed a theoretical model for online tracking of mobile hosts [4]. <p> The resulting graph will be a tree with edges directed towards the root, the current location of the mobile host <ref> [21] </ref>. Example D.1: For an easier understanding we will illustrate with an example. Let 52 the notation move (a,b) represent a move of the mobile host from registration area a to registration area b. <p> Now, the mobile host makes the following move, move (5,2). The mutation of the graph due to move (5,2) is shown in Fig. 15 (b). Fig. 15. An Example of Forwarding Tree The following obervations can be made <ref> [21] </ref>: 1) The graph due to the forwarding pointers will be a tree with edges directed towards the root, the current location of the mobile host. 2 2) The resulting graph after mutation due to a move of the mobile host still remains a tree, however, with a different root, the <p> Else, a chain of forwarding pointers is traversed till the M SS containing the host h 0 is reached. The search protocol is as shown in Fig. 35. 6. Search-Update Protocols The idea of manipulating forwarding pointers upon a successful search was earlier suggested in <ref> [21] </ref>. It was used to track objects in a decentralized object oriented computer system. Location management becomes more efficient if the location updates also take place after a successful search.

Reference-contexts: Conventional routing protocols can be broadly classified as distance vector and link state protocols. Distance vector routing uses the classical distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm <ref> [11, 30, 40, 55] </ref>. Each host maintains for each destination a set of distances through each of its neighbors. In order to maintain up-to-date information, each host periodically broadcasts to each of its neighbors, its current estimate of the shortest path to every other host in the network.

Reference-contexts: With the availability of wireless interface cards, mobile users are no longer required to remain confined within the static network premises to get network access. A host that can move while retaining its network connection is a mobile host (mh) <ref> [31] </ref>. Mobility is not the same as wirelessness. Mobile host is one who has ability to communicate anytime anywhere. On the other hand, a wireless host is one which is physically untethered by a communication link, which is a capability of the physical media in use. <p> Conversely, a wireless capability in a host does not necessarily imply unlimited mobility. There are a number of wireless local area networks (LANs) <ref> [20, 31] </ref> which, although free from the physical constraints of cables, cannot be considered to be WANs because of their limited range of operation. The journal model is IEEE Transactions on Computers. 2 A. <p> A mobile host communicates with one MSS at any given time. MSS is responsible for forwarding data between the mobile host and static network. Communication to and from the mobile host takes place via the static network. An example of infrastructure networks is the new Personal Communication Systems (PCS) <ref> [20, 31] </ref>. 2. Dynamic Networks Dynamic networks consist of mobile hosts which can communicate with each other over the wireless links (direct or indirect) without any static network interaction. In such networks the mobile host has the capability to communicate directly with another mobile host in its vicinity. <p> In a client-server environment, mobile clients may find themselves far away from their servers; servers may also move further away from their clients. Thus, the system will have to adapt to changing spatial distribution of clients by dynamic replication of data and services (for example <ref> [31] </ref>). * Available Storage on Mobile Computers: The storage space available on a mobile computer is limited by physical size and power requirements. Traditionally, disks provide large amounts of stable (non-volatile) storage. However, in a mobile computer, disks are a liability. <p> This in turn will impact performance of protocols (e.g., recovery protocols) that require these critical data [1, 48, 65]. * Disconnections : Mobile units run on batteries; with limited capacity <ref> [20, 31] </ref>. Limitations in battery power and bandwidth make disconnections from the network very frequent. Disconnections have various degrees depending on bandwidth availability. Because of their frequency, disconnections must be treated differently than failures or crashes. The difference between disconnection and failure is its elective nature. <p> Disconnections have various degrees depending on bandwidth availability. Because of their frequency, disconnections must be treated differently than failures or crashes. The difference between disconnection and failure is its elective nature. Disconnections are to be treated as planned failures which can be anticipated and prepared for <ref> [20, 31, 68] </ref>. Disconnections cause the network topology to change in dynamic networks. This is because the disconnected mobile host can no longer be used for forwarding data. <p> The system model of the infrastructure network is the same as explained in Chapter I. A mobile host may become unavailable due to (i) failure of the mobile host, (ii) disconnection of the mobile host, and (iii) wireless link failure <ref> [20, 31, 48, 65] </ref>. Loss of battery power make disconnections from the network frequent, and sometimes unpredictable. Because of their frequency, disconnections must be treated differently than failures. The difference between disconnection and failure is its elective nature. <p> Because of their frequency, disconnections must be treated differently than failures. The difference between disconnection and failure is its elective nature. User initiated disconnections can be treated as planned failures, which can be anticipated and prepared for <ref> [20, 31, 68] </ref>. The wireless link is equivalent to an intermittently faulty link, which transmits correct messages during fault-free conditions, and stops any transmissions upon a failure. Disconnections and weak wireless links primarily delay the system response, whereas a host failure affects the system state. <p> Section C presents the recovery strategies. Section D gives the performance analysis of the recovery strategies, and summary is found in Section E. B. Related Work Research in mobile computing primarily has focussed on mobility management, database system issues, network protocols, disconnected operation and distributed algorithms for mobile hosts <ref> [20, 31] </ref>. Work on fault-tolerance issues is very limited. Alagar et.al. [2], demonstrate schemes to tolerate base station failures by replicating the information stored at a base station, at several "secondary" base stations. Strategies for selecting the secondary base stations were shown. <p> We analyzed the performance of the various recovery schemes proposed in this chapter, and determined those mobile environments where a particular recovery scheme is best-suited. 42 CHAPTER III CENTRALIZED LOCATION MANAGEMENT A. Introduction It is expected that existing wireless cellular networks will be upgraded for personal communication services (PCS) <ref> [20, 31, 58] </ref>. An important issue in mobile wireless networks is the design and analysis of location management schemes. In order to communicate with any particular user, it is first necessary to locate the user in the network.

Reference-contexts: However, when the network sizes increase, the MR will become a serious bottleneck, and one has to resort to more efficient location management techniques. Ioannidis et.al. proposed IP-based protocols for providing continuous networks access for mobile computers using caching and forwarding technique <ref> [32] </ref>. However, these protocols are primarily proposed for a campus environment with mobile computers. Badrinath et.al. examine strategies that reduce search costs and control the volume of location updates by employing user profiles [5]. <p> In the existing proposals for infrastructure wireless networks, routing information of each mobile host is maintained in some database (HLR and VLR in IS-41 [46, 58], home agent and foreign agent in mobile IP <ref> [32, 62] </ref>) which is located in the static network. However, there is no such database available for dynamic networks. Due to limited range of the wireless transreceivers, a mobile host can communicate with another host only within a limited geographical region around it.

Reference-contexts: Strategies are developed in this paper to recover from various transient faults in the mobile host. These are faults that are typically caused by environmental upsets (e.g., wireless link failure, power glitches at the mobile host, electromagnetic interference, radiation, etc.) or software errors (e.g., heisenbugs <ref> [38] </ref>, rarely used code paths, etc.). Transient failures are the most common mode of failure [64]. We assume the well known fail-silent [64] model. In this model, upon a failure at a mobile host, the host stops executing, and its state is lost. <p> Checkpointing and message logging techniques have been proposed earlier for efficient rollback and recovery with minimal loss in performance <ref> [38, 64] </ref>.

The problems in using conventional routing protocols in a dynamic network have been discussed in great detail in <ref> [39, 61] </ref>. For completeness sake, we briefly list the problems in the following. * The conventional routing protocols were not designed for networks where the topological connectivity is subject to frequent, unpredictable change as evident in dynamic networks. <p> In dynamic networks, where topology updates are frequent, the update overhead may be very high. Johnson propose a new routing method for ad-hoc networks based on separate route discovery and route maintenance protocols <ref> [39] </ref>. The concept of Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is extended to discover routes. However, if proper measures are not taken, the network performance can degrade due to the propagation of redundant route discovery requests. Route maintenance is achieved by using hop-by-hop acknowledgement.

Other Clustering Approaches The problem of clustering in networks has been discussed earlier in literature <ref> [23, 34, 41, 66, 70] </ref>. Our work differs from the earlier works in the following respect: * Clustering was proposed as a hierarchical approach in earlier literature to reduce the amount of routing information stored at individual hosts. <p> clusters, which, limits the number of nodes taking part in the topology-update operation, thereby, reducing the network load during topology updates. * The cluster creation and maintenance algorithms have not been discussed in most of the literature where if it is discussed, it either is specifically for regular graph structures <ref> [41, 70] </ref>, or employs a cluster controller (or leader) [66]. In this work we create and maintain a small number of clusters (cliques) in an arbitrary graph. The cluster graph is created using a sequence of Switch ON procedures (one procedure call for each node being added).

Reference-contexts: Various techniques have been proposed in literature to estimate r. A detailed investigation of the algorithms for estimating r, namely, running average, and reset-K were presented in [36]. In Chapter IV <ref> [46] </ref>, we propose algorithms to estimate r based on the history of call and mobility patterns. The basic assumption behind these algorithms are that past history of the user's call mobility patterns will reflect the behavior in future. I. <p> typical personal communications network, it was determined that the memory required at the first level (the parents of the leaf level nodes) location servers for P I equal to 1 hour, was about 340 Kbytes when no search updates were used, and, about 840 Kbytes when jump updates were used <ref> [46] </ref>. Let the current time be curr time. If f p time 6= N U LL, and curr time f p time P I, then the entry for the host is purged from the M SS 3 . <p> This chapter investigates the consequence of mobility and disconnections of mobile hosts on the design and performance of routing protocol in a dynamic network. In the existing proposals for infrastructure wireless networks, routing information of each mobile host is maintained in some database (HLR and VLR in IS-41 <ref> [46, 58] </ref>, home agent and foreign agent in mobile IP [32, 62]) which is located in the static network. However, there is no such database available for dynamic networks.

Proposed Approach This chapter presents a new methodology for routing and topology information maintenance in dynamic networks <ref> [47] </ref>. Our approach is motivated by our study of existence of clusters (size greater than 2) in random graphs. The basic idea behind the protocol is to divide the graph into number of overlapping clusters. A change in the 125 network topology corresponds to a change in the cluster membership.

This in turn will impact performance of protocols (e.g., recovery protocols) that require these critical data <ref> [1, 48, 65] </ref>. * Disconnections : Mobile units run on batteries; with limited capacity [20, 31]. Limitations in battery power and bandwidth make disconnections from the network very frequent. Disconnections have various degrees depending on bandwidth availability. Because of their frequency, disconnections must be treated differently than failures or crashes. <p> The system model of the infrastructure network is the same as explained in Chapter I. A mobile host may become unavailable due to (i) failure of the mobile host, (ii) disconnection of the mobile host, and (iii) wireless link failure <ref> [20, 31, 48, 65] </ref>. Loss of battery power make disconnections from the network frequent, and sometimes unpredictable. Because of their frequency, disconnections must be treated differently than failures.

Infrastructure Networks Infrastructure networks are two tiered networks composed of a static backbone network and peripheral wireless networks <ref> [9, 51, 58] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Previous Work Numerous routing protocols have been proposed in the recent years. One of the most popular techniques for routing in communication networks is via distributed 122 algorithms for finding shortest paths in weighted graphs <ref> [24, 35, 69, 55] </ref>. These distributed algorithms differ in the way the routing tables at each host are constructed, maintained and updated. <p> Conventional routing protocols can be broadly classified as distance vector and link state protocols. Distance vector routing uses the classical distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm <ref> [11, 30, 40, 55] </ref>. Each host maintains for each destination a set of distances through each of its neighbors. In order to maintain up-to-date information, each host periodically broadcasts to each of its neighbors, its current estimate of the shortest path to every other host in the network.

Reference-contexts: For each destination, the host determines a neighbor to be the next hop for that destination if the neighbor has the shortest path to the destination. Link state routing requires each host to have knowledge of the entire network topology <ref> [56] </ref>. To maintain consistent information, each host monitors the cost of each communication link to each of its neighbors, and periodically broadcasts an update 123 in this information to all other hosts in the network. <p> However, due to long propagation delays, partitioned network, etc., some nodes may have inconsistent topology information. This might lead to 148 formation of routing loops. However, these loops are short-term, because they disappear within bounded time (required to traverse the diameter of the network) <ref> [56] </ref>. Even these loops can be avoided if each route table entry is tagged with a sequence number so that nodes can quickly distinguish stale routes from the new ones and avoid formation of routing loops [61]. The new cluster information will be propagated throughout the network.

There are existing standards for carrying out location management in a centralized manner, e.g., EIA/TIA Interim Standard 41 (IS-41) <ref> [58] </ref>. However, these schemes are not efficient, due to increase in network load and location management costs.

Introduction It is expected that existing wireless cellular networks will be upgraded for personal communication services (PCS) <ref> [20, 31, 58] </ref>. An important issue in mobile wireless networks is the design and analysis of location management schemes. In order to communicate with any particular user, it is first necessary to locate the user in the network. <p> There are existing standards for carrying out location management using home location servers (HLS), e.g., (EIA/TIA) Interim Standard 41 (IS-41), and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) in Europe <ref> [58] </ref>. However, these schemes are not efficient, due to increase in network load and location management costs. To overcome these drawbacks, this chapter presents location management strategies using forwarding pointers in addition to HLS. <p> Later in this section we will present the proposed location management scheme using forwarding pointers, and the corresponding performance analysis. 1. Overview of the Basic IS-41 Scheme Location management with home location servers is being used in current personal communication systems (PCS) standards proposals such as IS-41 <ref> [58] </ref>. 1 The terminology used in IS-41 literature is slightly different. IS-41 uses home location register (HLR) and visitor location register (V LR) databases. <p> We use the following notations and data for our analysis. The data is obtained from <ref> [58] </ref>. <p> Assumption (1) may not be true for all network architectures. This assumption is mainly motivated by the studies which indicate HLS to be the bottleneck in PCNs <ref> [36, 37, 58] </ref>. On the other hand, assumption (2) helps in determining the lower bounds for the performance of our schemes. <p> This chapter investigates the consequence of mobility and disconnections of mobile hosts on the design and performance of routing protocol in a dynamic network. In the existing proposals for infrastructure wireless networks, routing information of each mobile host is maintained in some database (HLR and VLR in IS-41 <ref> [46, 58] </ref>, home agent and foreign agent in mobile IP [32, 62]) which is located in the static network. However, there is no such database available for dynamic networks.

In a client-server environment, mobile clients may find themselves far away from their servers; servers may also move further away from their clients. <p> Moreover, their protocol required frequent broadcasts of the routing table by the mobile hosts. The overhead of the frequent broadcasts goes up as the population of mobile hosts increases. Another scheme based on distance vector pathfinding algorithm was proposed by <ref> [59] </ref>. Although loops are avoided completely, all 124 the nodes end up sending an update message to their neighbors during a topology update operation. In dynamic networks, where topology updates are frequent, the update overhead may be very high. <p> Such a host will be represented in the graph by a disconnected node. A host H v1 is connected to another host H v2 if there exists at least one path from node v1 to v2. Similar to <ref> [16, 59] </ref>, an underlying link-level protocol is assumed which assures the following: * A node is aware of all its neighbors at all times. * All packets transmitted over a link are received correctly and in proper sequence within a finite time. * All control messages are processed one at a

Example of such networks are ad-hoc networks <ref> [17, 39, 61] </ref>, and packet radio networks [16, 40, 42]. An important issue in dynamic networks is the design and analysis of routing schemes. This chapter investigates the consequence of mobility and disconnections of mobile hosts on the design and performance of routing protocol in a dynamic network. <p> These distributed algorithms differ in the way the routing tables at each host are constructed, maintained and updated. The primary attributes for any routing protocol are : * Simplicity : Simple protocols are preferred for implementation in operational networks <ref> [61] </ref>. * Loop-free : At any moment, the paths implied from the routing tables of all hosts taken together should not have loops. Looping of data packets results in considerable overhead. * Convergence characteristics : Time required to converge to new routes after a topology change should not be high. <p> The processing overhead and the network bandwidth overhead of link state protocols are generally more than distance vector protocols. The problems in using conventional routing protocols in a dynamic network have been discussed in great detail in <ref> [39, 61] </ref>. For completeness sake, we briefly list the problems in the following. * The conventional routing protocols were not designed for networks where the topological connectivity is subject to frequent, unpredictable change as evident in dynamic networks. <p> The protocol described in <ref> [61] </ref> addresses some of the above stated problems by modifying the Bellman-Ford routing algorithm. They use sequence numbers to prevent routing table loops, and, settling-time data for damping out fluctuations in route table updates. The convergence on the average is rapid, however, the worst case convergence is large. <p> Even these loops can be avoided if each route table entry is tagged with a sequence number so that nodes can quickly distinguish stale routes from the new ones and avoid formation of routing loops <ref> [61] </ref>. The new cluster information will be propagated throughout the network. It should be noted that only the boundary nodes are responsible for broadcasting and rebroadcasting any new information. This helps in quick dissemination of information across the network. Thus, the reconvergence of the cluster-based protocols is very quick. <p> Thus, a compromise on routing optimality as suggested in [16] to avoid network congestion might not be required. Quick reconvergence in some protocols like DSDV <ref> [61] </ref> is obtained by quick rebroadcast by each and every recipient of the broadcast, causing degradation of the availability of the wireless medium. However, in our approach, re-broadcast is done only by the boundary nodes. Nodes other than boundary nodes just listen and update their tables.

Reference-contexts: In the existing proposals for infrastructure wireless networks, routing information of each mobile host is maintained in some database (HLR and VLR in IS-41 [46, 58], home agent and foreign agent in mobile IP <ref> [32, 62] </ref>) which is located in the static network. However, there is no such database available for dynamic networks. Due to limited range of the wireless transreceivers, a mobile host can communicate with another host only within a limited geographical region around it.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the appropriate recovery protocol needs to be determined adaptively, based on the characteristics of the underlying wireless network and users. Performance of traditional recovery schemes primarily depends on the failure rate of the host <ref> [63, 77] </ref>. However, in a mobile environment, due to mobility of the hosts and limited bandwidth on the wireless links, parameters other than failure rate of the mobile host play a key role in determining the effectiveness of a recovery scheme.

Reference-contexts: These are faults that are typically caused by environmental upsets (e.g., wireless link failure, power glitches at the mobile host, electromagnetic interference, radiation, etc.) or software errors (e.g., heisenbugs [38], rarely used code paths, etc.). Transient failures are the most common mode of failure <ref> [64] </ref>. We assume the well known fail-silent [64] model.

Reference-contexts: This will require any critical data (e.g., database logs, process checkpoint) to be stored elsewhere other than the mobile computer. This in turn will impact performance of protocols (e.g., recovery protocols) that require these critical data <ref> [1, 48, 65] </ref>. * Disconnections : Mobile units run on batteries; with limited capacity [20, 31]. Limitations in battery power and bandwidth make disconnections from the network very frequent. Disconnections have various degrees depending on bandwidth availability. Because of their frequency, disconnections must be treated differently than failures or crashes. <p> The system model of the infrastructure network is the same as explained in Chapter I. A mobile host may become unavailable due to (i) failure of the mobile host, (ii) disconnection of the mobile host, and (iii) wireless link failure <ref> [20, 31, 48, 65] </ref>. Loss of battery power make disconnections from the network frequent, and sometimes unpredictable. Because of their frequency, disconnections must be treated differently than failures.

Rangarajan et.al. <ref> [67] </ref>, present a fault-tolerant protocol for location directory maintenance in mobile networks. The protocol tolerates base station failures and host disconnections. Logical timestamps are used to distinguish between old and new location information. The protocol also tolerates the corruption of these logical 15 timestamps.

The difference between disconnection and failure is its elective nature. Disconnections are to be treated as planned failures which can be anticipated and prepared for <ref> [20, 31, 68] </ref>. Disconnections cause the network topology to change in dynamic networks. This is because the disconnected mobile host can no longer be used for forwarding data. <p> Because of their frequency, disconnections must be treated differently than failures. The difference between disconnection and failure is its elective nature. User initiated disconnections can be treated as planned failures, which can be anticipated and prepared for <ref> [20, 31, 68] </ref>. The wireless link is equivalent to an intermittently faulty link, which transmits correct messages during fault-free conditions, and stops any transmissions upon a failure. Disconnections and weak wireless links primarily delay the system response, whereas a host failure affects the system state.

Similar to our work in this chapter, these strategies augment the basic location strategy which uses HLS. Section I compares them with the work presented in this chapter.

There is a dedicated user agent per user and these user agents are responsible to forward any communication to or from the user. This scheme is mainly aimed for local networks the kind used within building premises.
