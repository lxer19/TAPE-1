Abstract: In the past two decades, large efforts have been directed towards the development of new technologies dedicated to the micrometer, nanometer and atomic scale. In solid-state technology, the typical dimension has been decreased from the millimeter to fractions of a micrometer, chemistry has advanced in synthesizing molecules from ensembles consisting of a few atoms to structures of nanometer size, and physicists even managed to sense and manipulate single atoms. Related to this progress, an emerging challenge is the controlled treatment of microscopic and nanoscopic objects as individuals. This paper presents a robot system aimed at manipulating objects of a size of a few tens of micrometers with nanometer precision. Therefore, dimensions at the lower micrometer and the sub-micrometer scale are addressed a domain which is often termed mesoscopic. The design and implementation of such a robot system demands large interdisciplinary efforts, joining the expertise of mechanical and electrical engineering, of optics and control theory, and of solid-state physics. We report the realization of the full system, which relies on close interaction between these fields. Thus, we emphasize rather the conceptual aspects of system design than the theoretical details of each of the disciplines involved. However, an essential fl This paper reports results from the interdisciplinary Nanorobotics project with contributions from six laboratories at ETH Zurich. The authors emphasize that much of the work is not their own but achieved in collaboration with the colleagues R. Buchi, R. Buser, A. Codourey, G. Greitmann, O. Kubler, E. Mazza, M. Muller, G.

Reference-contexts: Here, none of them is clearly dominant or can be neglected. Consequently, contact manipulation is most difficult in this domain and sticking effects are the limiting factor in the handling of micro-parts <ref> [ Arai et al. 1995 ] </ref> . Although mesoscopic physics is an active field of research, a practical solution to the sticking problem has not yet been found. The purpose of our study is to examine how tools, e.g., mechanical tweezers, can be modified in order to reduce adhesion.

Reference-contexts: For high resolution manipulation in the mesoscopic domain, such structures are insufficient because of two reasons. Firstly, the resolution is limited by friction and play in the joints <ref> [ Armstrong 1991 ] </ref> . Secondly, conventional manipulators are often serial arrangements of articulated joints and links where each actuator and link has to carry all subsequent ones. Serial chains lead to compliant structures and therefore, to large vibration amplitudes.

Reference-contexts: The second one contains the lost-motion ~ lost , which accounts for friction and load effects. Friction is the most uncertain parameter in equation (3) <ref> [ Buechi 1996 ] </ref> . Hence, the optimum operation condition in terms of reliability and maximum repeatability is obtained if * is small, and * F k is adapted to the expected range of F L . <p> This is less than 1% of the commanded displacement and coincides with the error calculations based on the expected variation of friction <ref> [ Buechi 1996 ] </ref> . In figure 5, we observe significant translational offset pretending an asymmetric behavior of Abalone. With experiments where we tilted the tread on which Abalone is moving, we demonstrated the inclination to be the principal reason of this path following error [ Zesch 1997 ] . <p> Indeed, this concept is realized with inertial drives, integrated in our system (cf. section 4.1.1). Finally, a significant improvement can be expected from the use of joint sensors for local stabilization <ref> [ Buechi 1996 ] </ref> . They stabilize the position during the dead-time of the visual control cycle. Such joint sensors are not yet included in our robot prototype. One of the most important issues in object manipulation is gentle picking.

Reference-contexts: Neither grasping nor releasing bear serious problems, provided that the object diameter is larger than about 100 to 200 m. At the other end of the scale, single atoms can be handled with relative ease by applying an electrical field between the tool and the substrate. Quantum corrals <ref> [ Crommie et al. 1993 ] </ref> assembled of 48 iron atoms on a copper surface and comparable highlights in atom-handling [ Stroscio and Eigler 1991 ] have led to the idea of nano-scale devices [ Wada et al. 1993 ] . <p> Int'l.

For structures larger than a few micrometers, the mechanical behavior can successfully be modeled with continuum mechanical theories.

Reference-contexts: This interpretation does not consider other critical measures such as the minimal size of an object just visible or the minimum positional change of an object that can be detected [ Inoue 1989 ] . In <ref> [ Danuser 1997 ] </ref> , a redefinition of the resolution terminology is introduced which distinguishes between visibility, separability and localizability 3 . These terms are graphically presented in figure 7. <p> Actually, the capacity of our microscope system is only C 0 = 1 2 C, since we do not observe two independent polarization states of light (cf. <ref> [ Danuser 1997 ] </ref> ). In contrast to the classical two-point formulations, the stochastic nature of the signal is considered in (4). As one would expect, the information capacity increases with better SNR and is zero in case of a completely vanishing SNR. <p> In our work, we make use of the prior knowledge about the shape and dynamics of the manipulation tool, i.e., the micro-pipette. It is always known if and which of the robot devices has been moved in the period between two cycles of image capturing. Computer Vision algorithms <ref> [ Danuser 1997 ] </ref> represent effective means to integrate such information into the procedure of visual control. Provided that the system does not exhibit ego-motion, the complete information of the scene dynamics is available. <p> Provided that the system does not exhibit ego-motion, the complete information of the scene dynamics is available. Thus, the full temporal contribution C T to the capacity C is available for the transmission of further spatial information. In <ref> [ Danuser 1997 ] </ref> it is shown that C T = 2:0. Consequently, one might expect a separability performance Int'l. J. of Robotics Research (submission) 25 of our super-resolving system of ffi 0 ffi R . <p> The right side of figure 8 shows a diagram of the pipette's tip positions extracted by the computer vision algorithms together with the outline of the sphere. The applied extraction method relies on the evaluation of intra- and inter-frame information <ref> [ Danuser 1997 ] </ref> . The processing of inter-frame information includes the knowledge that the pipette has moved between each frame. The information about the tool's geometry in this case the pipette axis is modeled as a straight line in 3D is imposed in the intra-frame processing. <p> It represents a measure for the minimal positional change discernible in the image. This type of resolution is considerably higher than the one in separability. Some heuristics on the localizability of an image feature allows us to derive the relation (cf. <ref> [ Danuser 1997 ] </ref> ) = SNR 1:7561 between the limit of resolution in localization and the Rayleigh limit ffi R being a measure for the separability. It is inversely proportional to the SNR of the image signal. <p> In microscopy, additional difficulties arise from the weak contrast and the transparency of many specimen. Indeed, the reconstruction from stereo is the weakest component of our vision control system. Robust 3D representations are only accomplished for objects where an analytical model can be formulated <ref> [ Danuser 1997 ] </ref> . Model-based stereo allows to bridge information gaps due to ambiguous or missing feature correspondence between the views of the stereo-rig. Analytical models are available for the manipulation tools and only for a restricted class of objects. <p> The positional changes were measured simultaneously by computational vision and interferometry. Since we determined changes in object positions, the evaluation of the differences between the data from vision and interferometry yields an empirical estimate for the relative localization accuracy. The implemented vision algorithm <ref> [ Danuser 1997 ] </ref> allows us to track arbitrary patterns generated by isolated objects on the robot platform. The position estimate is invariant with respect to linear geometric and radiometric pattern distortions and rotations smaller than 15 ffi . Some sample patterns are shown in figure 13.

Reference-contexts: Very often, the resolution of a DVLM is specified with the classical two-point resolution <ref> [ Den Dekker and Van den Bos 1997 ] </ref> , which relies on the theory of diffraction. This resolution is defined as the imaging system's ability to resolve two point sources of equal intensity in the object space.

Reference-contexts: For SNR between 30 dB and 45 dB, which is usual in video light microscopy, a resolution in localization from 50fi to 235fi the Rayleigh limit can be expected.

J. of Robotics Research (submission) 27 necessary to achieve the localizability given by quantum theory. Neither the CCD-technology nor the state-of-the art in A/D-conversion allow for such SNR. Thus, the fundamental positional uncertainty of an object described by quantum effects is irrelevant in video microscopy. Indeed, <ref> [ Denk and Webb 1990 ] </ref> have verified their calculations based on interferometry providing SNR at the required level. To conclude, with standard DVLM technology positional changes of better than 1/200 of the Rayleigh limit can be resolved.

Reference-contexts: Due to its special design, the system is unsuited for general micro-manipulation. Another area of research deals with transportation of micro-particles by directly [ Moesner and Higuchi 1995 ] or indirectly <ref> [ Fearing 1995a ] </ref> applying electric and magnetic field forces. They bear the advantage of not requiring dedicated tools for object handling and high resolution kinematics. Nevertheless, this type of actuation is restricted to planar problems.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, the force of gravity can be neglected with respect to electrostatic and van der Waals forces, when single atoms are handled. The crossover between these competing forces is located at the boundary between the microscopic and mesoscopic domains (cf. figure 11) <ref> [ Fearing 1995b ] </ref> . Here, none of them is clearly dominant or can be neglected. Consequently, contact manipulation is most difficult in this domain and sticking effects are the limiting factor in the handling of micro-parts [ Arai et al. 1995 ] .

Reference-contexts: We have chosen piezo-electric actuators, since they combine fast positioning with nanometer resolution in a working range of a few microns. The rough motion mode, i.e., the motion by steps, relies on the inertial principle <ref> [ Higuchi et al. 1990 ] </ref> . Compared to crawling drives such as the Inchworm 1 , this bears the advantage of requiring only one actuator, which results in simpler design and control.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, the mechanisms become mechanically expensive and are difficult to miniaturize. Furthermore, these systems predominantly rely on teleoperated control.

Reference-contexts: Serial chains lead to compliant structures and therefore, to large vibration amplitudes. To overcome these limitations we have changed the design in two respects: (1) Instead of serial chains, parallel structures are used <ref> [ Merlet 1992 ] </ref> . They offer a larger stiffness due to short drive trains.

Reference-contexts: The groups of Hatamura and Sato developed ultra precise manipulators, which enable a human operator to interact with the micro-world [ Morishita and Hatamura 1993 ] .

Reference-contexts: Actuation: Actuator systems with resolution in the m-range are commercially available. Usually, they rely on devices such as screws and electro-motors. The attainable accuracy is limited by the mechanical uncertainty of the components involved. An improvement of resolution and accuracy of these actuators is mechanically expensive <ref> [ Mizumoto et al. 1995 ] </ref> . Thus, these techniques are not adequate to work in the mesoscopic domain. In the atomic domain, the requested resolution is achieved with the use of scanning tunneling and atomic Int'l.

Reference-contexts: J. of Robotics Research (submission) 7 cascaded and independently controlled macro/micro actuators consisting of feed screw drives and piezo-electric elements. Due to its special design, the system is unsuited for general micro-manipulation. Another area of research deals with transportation of micro-particles by directly <ref> [ Moesner and Higuchi 1995 ] </ref> or indirectly [ Fearing 1995a ] applying electric and magnetic field forces. They bear the advantage of not requiring dedicated tools for object handling and high resolution kinematics. Nevertheless, this type of actuation is restricted to planar problems.

Reference-contexts: In the late eighties and the early nineties, several projects were launched dealing with teleop-erated micro-handling.

Reference-contexts: As denoted by the arrows in table 1, two principal strategies may be pursued to proceed to this new dimension, both relying on the extension of standard techniques established either in the microscopic or in the atomic world <ref> [ Rohrer 1992 ] </ref> : Top-down approaches deal with the miniaturization of macroscopic and microscopic structures which implies an improvement of the related handling precision. Bottom-up approaches aim at forming mesoscopic structures by steadily increasing the complexity of atom ensembles.

Reference-contexts: Although the Rayleigh limit gives important hints on the resolution performance of the microscope, it is incomplete in describing all necessary aspects of resolution in the context of a visual controller. A frequently mentioned problem of the Rayleigh criterion first pointed out by <ref> [ Ronchi 1961 ] </ref> is that the related limit is determined solely by the calculated shape of the point-spread function. It relies on an imaging model, which does not account for noise. Consequently, the Rayleigh limit might not be fully adequate to reflect the practical resolution.

Reference-contexts: Considerable efforts have been directed towards the design of a haptic man-machine interface for improved interaction with the nano-world <ref> [ Sato et al. 1994 ] </ref> . The general strategy pursued by both groups is to attain accuracy using high precision robot components. They employ a large number of actuators to compensate errors in the kinematic chain. Consequently, the mechanisms become mechanically expensive and are difficult to miniaturize.

Reference-contexts: Also, they possess only small masses to be moved by the actuators and thus, are well suited for fast motion. (2) In order to avoid resolution limiting friction and stick-slip, the active and passive joints have to be replaced by elastic hinges or flexible structures <ref> [ Smith and Chetwynd 1992 ] </ref> . An example for such a mechanism is Abalone. The planar 3-DOF inertial drive [ Zesch et al. 1995 ] basically consists of two concentric platforms connected by three parallel chains (cf. figure 4 (a)).

Reference-contexts: At the other end of the scale, single atoms can be handled with relative ease by applying an electrical field between the tool and the substrate. Quantum corrals [ Crommie et al. 1993 ] assembled of 48 iron atoms on a copper surface and comparable highlights in atom-handling <ref> [ Stroscio and Eigler 1991 ] </ref> have led to the idea of nano-scale devices [ Wada et al. 1993 ] .

Reference-contexts: However, their working space is restricted to the maximum expansion of the piezo-elements. This is insufficient for most of the more complex manipulations necessary to deal with mesoscopic objects. Sensing: Used as sensing devices, both STM and AFM are able to resolve single atoms <ref> [ Mate et al. 1987, Sugawara et al. 1995 ] </ref> . In contrast to optical sensors, these microscopes are not limited by diffraction. The attainable resolution of the AFM is defined by the radius of the scanning probe.

Reference-contexts: Hydrophobic materials tend to exhibit a low surface energy and thus, are often assumed to be anti-adhesive. Consequently, the van der Waals interaction of such objects is reduced. Indeed, we observed this effect <ref> [ Vogeli and von Kanel 1997a ] </ref> . However, for the sticking problems in contact handling, this reduction would not be of much help.

Reference-contexts: This should allow one a controlled release for very small objects.

Reference-contexts: Using the Coulomb law of friction in our rigid body model, we can show that the step size for a triangle wave form (cf. figure 2) with a cycle ratio = T f T becomes <ref> [ Zesch 1997 ] </ref> : ~ = ~ 0 ~ lost = 1 m 2 m 1 + m 2 F k F L ! where F k denotes the kinetic friction force and F L is the load force acting on the mechanism in the direction of motion. <p> In figure 5, we observe significant translational offset pretending an asymmetric behavior of Abalone. With experiments where we tilted the tread on which Abalone is moving, we demonstrated the inclination to be the principal reason of this path following error <ref> [ Zesch 1997 ] </ref> . Accordingly, inertial drives especially in a configuration with multiple DOFs are very sensitive to external load forces. Therefore, we used this principle in our robot for horizontal motions and counterbalanced rotations only. Contrarily, they are not adequate for vertical translations.
