Abstract: This paper proposes the idea of vision agents over Internet, outlines the performance models of Live WWW with agents, and describes an object search agent and its communications with other agents. The goal is to reduce the traffic on the Internet for Live WWW by integrating the WWW technology, agent theory and computer vision technology together.

Reference-contexts: Right now, there are more than a hundred interesting mechanical devices are connected to the WWW [18]. For example, Paul Cooper et. al developed a interactive, telerobotic system InterCam <ref> [1] </ref>. Ken Goldberg et al. [8] developed a three axis telerobotic system where users were able to explore a remote world with buried objects and alter it by blowing bursts of compressed air into its sand filled world.

Reference-contexts: Another effort to make the WWW live is represented by the WWW browser Vosaic, or Video Mosaic, which extends the architecture of the WWW to encompass the dynamic, real time information space of video and audio <ref> [2] </ref>. In Vosaic, video and audio transfers occur in real time; there is no file retrieval latency. The video and audio result in compelling Web pages. Real time video and audio data can be effectively served over the present day Internet with the proper transmission protocol.

Reference-contexts: The initial environment is a collection of physical museum exhibits which WWW users can view at various positions, orientations, and levels of resolution. Cooperstock et. al <ref> [3] </ref> proposed the idea of World-Wide Media Space (WMS) for video-conferencing, which supports navigation with an active floor plan and exploits sensors to provide additional information for remote activity.

Reference-contexts: simply respond to their environment: they can exhibit goal-directed behavior by initiating actions; * Trust: agents usually do what they are supposed to do according to their percep tion of the task and the world situation; An Internet agent refers to an agent that acts on the browser's behalf [5] <ref> [4] </ref> [19]. The most popular agents on the Web are indexing agents such as Lycos, the WebCrawler, and In-foSeek. Indexing agents carry out a massive, autonomous search of the WWW, and store an index of words in document title and document texts.

Reference-contexts: A recent study by a popular server of shareware, Jumbo, revealed that about 1 in 5 users were connecting with graphics turned off, to eliminate the annoying latency of loading web pages <ref> [6] </ref>, not to say when live video is included in the web pages. To make the live video over Internet popular, a study of how to reduce the bandwidth used by the live WWW is required.

Reference-contexts: Thus, image compression, that is to remove the data redundancy, code redundancy, inter-pixel redundancy, and psycho-visual redundancy in an image before it is transmitted, is a necessary step in live WWW. Various compression standards, most of which are based on JPEG [11] and MPEG <ref> [7] </ref>, have been used for live WWW and other multi-media WWW. JPEG offers four modes of operation: lossless encoding, sequential encoding, progressive encoding, and hierarchical encoding.

Reference-contexts: Thus, in order to make the site appear "live", many live WWW sites have to reduce the transmitting rate. For example, Telepresence Systems, Inc. <ref> [9] </ref> is working on the ProRata system which provides groups of geographically separated people with a sense of shared presence.
