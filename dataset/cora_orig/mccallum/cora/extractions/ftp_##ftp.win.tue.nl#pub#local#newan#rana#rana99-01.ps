Reference-contexts: x 2 + x 3 (7) where OE (x 1 ) = m 1 x 1 + 2 This system is known to have a so called double scroll chaotic attractor for ff = 15:6, m 0 = 8 7 , 7 , and 23 &lt; &lt; 31 (see e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>). We assume that y = x 2 is the transmitted signal. Note that in this case the relative degree of y with respect to equals 2.

Reference-contexts: To a degree, this tacit assumption is justified by the fact that it has been shown in <ref> [2] </ref> that for quite a wide choice of functions (t; w) we will have that (t; w (t))OE (w (t)) is P.E. when the signals y (t), u 1 (t) and u 2 (t) have a power spectrum that is not concentrated at too few a number of peaks.

Reference-contexts: It may be argued that from a practical point of view this is not a serious objection, since in practice one will have (7) "running" when communicating. However, as was shown in e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>, the system (7) for the given parameter values is chaotic in the sense of Shil'nikov. This implies in particular that the origin is a homoclinic point for (7), which gives by the above that e will also not tend to zero when (7) is initialized on the homoclinic orbit.

Reference-contexts: Two particularly interesting ideas which have emerged during this time are (chaos) synchronization and chaos control. Recent reviews on these subjects can be found in, for instance, two special issues devoted to the subject, see <ref> [4] </ref>,[18] (where in fact [4] is a follow up of an earlier special issue on the same subject of the same journal ([3])). Synchronization and controlled synchronization of chaotic systems is a topic that has become popular, among others, because of its possible use in communication, see [15],[14].

Reference-contexts: Note that in this case the relative degree of y with respect to equals 2. Further note that, although it has been shown experimentally that for constant the (x 1 ; x 3 )-subsystem synchronizes with the system ( _ ^x 3 = x 2 (see e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>), we cannot use this synchronizing subsystem in our reconstruction mechanism, since it explicitly depends on the unknown parameter . In order to come up with a a reconstruction scheme for , we first assume that, besides x 2 , we can also measure x 1 . <p> In <ref> [5] </ref>, it was shown experimentally that this will indeed be the case for constant . However, one needs to be somewhat careful here for the following reasons. Define the error signal e (t) := ^x 1 (t) x 1 (t).

Reference-contexts: This approach will be pursued in future research (note, however, that this idea has also been studied in [7]). The second approach, that will be pursued in this paper, and which in a sense was initiated for a particular case by Corron and Hahs in <ref> [6] </ref>, is that of system identification. In system identification, the task is to estimate unknown (possibly slowly time-varying) parameters of a system, based on measurements taken from the system. For linear systems, system identification is well-established (for an overview, see e.g. [17]). <p> After this, the essential identification background will be reviewed. In the following three sections, a reconstruction mechanism for each of the three examples will be derived. In the first example, it will be shown among others that the communication scheme that was proposed by Corron and Hahs in <ref> [6] </ref> fits well in the identification based approach to communication. In the last two examples, we will see that the existence of a synchronizing subsystem is not necessary for the existence of a reconstruction mechanism. Rather, one will typically have that (partial) synchronization occurs after message reconstruction. <p> After having introduced these examples, we will review the essential identification background. Example 2.1 Consider the following set up for secure communication that was proposed by Corron and Hahs in <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> known (see e.g. [15]) that for (10) the (x 1 ; x 2 )-subsystem does not synchronize with the system ( _ ^x 2 = ^x 1 + ^x 2 Thus, in this case no synchronizing subsystem that can be used in a reconstruction mechanism inspired by the scheme in <ref> [6] </ref> exists. However, it is possible to reconstruct based on the measurement y. A first step in this reconstruction is the observation that (10) may be transformed into a system with so called linearizable error dynamics (see e.g. [12],[11]). <p> one arrives at the following reconstruction mechanism: 8 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : _ ~w 1 = ~w 1 + g (y; ^x 2 ; ^x 3 ) sign ( ~w 1 ) 1+j ~w 1 j (^y y); ( &gt; 0) which is exactly the reconstruction mechanism proposed in <ref> [6] </ref>. Note, however, that in [6] this reconstruction mechanism was obtained in a different way. Further, in [6] the authors do not require the function (t; w) in (33) to be persistently exciting. However, if one carefully checks the derivation in [6], it turns out that also in [6] this requirement <p> reconstruction mechanism: 8 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : _ ~w 1 = ~w 1 + g (y; ^x 2 ; ^x 3 ) sign ( ~w 1 ) 1+j ~w 1 j (^y y); ( &gt; 0) which is exactly the reconstruction mechanism proposed in <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: More specifically, we will look at some problems in communication using chaotic systems for which (standard) synchronization-based schemes may not yield the reconstruction of encoded messages, but that can be resolved using control theoretic ideas. The present paper is an expanded version of the paper <ref> [8] </ref>. In communication using chaotic systems, one considers a transmitter system T of the form T _x = f (x; ); x 2 IR n (1) where is a time-varying message satisfying min (t) max (8t) and y 2 IR is the transmitted signal (i.e., the coded message).

Reference-contexts: Note that in the above example the "distance" between the message and the transmitted message y is small, in the sense that already the first time-derivative of y explicitly depends on (in control theoretic terms, this is expressed by saying that the relative degree (cf. <ref> [9] </ref>) of y with respect to equals 1). If one would like to use the above scheme for secure communication, this might be a drawback since it might mean that is not hidden well enough.

Reference-contexts: A possible advantage of using chaotic systems for communication is that the transmitted signal y will be a chaotic signal, which implies that it has a broad spectrum. This gives the opportunity to use the chaotic system under consideration for wideband communication (cf. <ref> [10] </ref>). Further, the fact that y is a chaotic (and thus seemingly random) signal gives the hope that chaotic systems may also be used for secure communication. All of this of course presupposes that y will also be a chaotic (or at least sufficiently complex) signal when is time-varying.

Reference-contexts: In system identification, the task is to estimate unknown (possibly slowly time-varying) parameters of a system, based on measurements taken from the system. For linear systems, system identification is well-established (for an overview, see e.g. <ref> [17] </ref>). In this paper, it will be shown on three examples that these identification methods may be helpful in communication using chaotic systems. <p> We will restrict to linear time-invariant systems with one output and two inputs that depend on one unknown parameter. The restriction to systems with only one input and the extension to systems with more than two inputs are straightforward. The exposition is based on <ref> [17] </ref>. For further details, the reader is referred to this reference. In the rest of the paper, we use the following notation and terminology. By IR [s], we denote the set of all polynomials in the indeterminate s with real coefficients.
