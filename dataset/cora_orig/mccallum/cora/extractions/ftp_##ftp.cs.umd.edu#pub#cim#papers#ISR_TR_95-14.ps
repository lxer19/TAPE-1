Reference-contexts: Rule-based systems have found success in near-net manufacturing domains and the recent trend is toward using knowledge of process physics and simulation to reason about manufacturability, looking for violations of design-for-manufacturability heuristics. Ishii et al. <ref> [Ish93, AI89, IM92, IN89] </ref> have developed design-compatibility analysis tools to aid in designing products for various life-cycle considerations. In their approach, a set of design elements is defined for each life-cycle application.

Reference-contexts: While their approach is capable of handling a limited number of accessibility constraints and tolerances, it does not consider the possibility of alternative features and does not provide any manufacturability rating scheme. Anjanappa et al. <ref> [AKAN91, KAA91] </ref> developed a rapid prototyping system for machined parts that emphasized existing standards and available databases. The design is stored as an IGES file and a rule-based feature extractor is used to find machining features. The feature extractor is limited and no intersections among features are allowed.

Reference-contexts: While ideal systems for manufacturability analysis are 10 plan-based, rules are often better suited for certain sub-problems within this domain. Similar to design for assembly, many major electronic manufacturers have taken the lead in developing metrics for evaluation of printed circuit board designs. NEC corporation <ref> [AKKI85] </ref>, General Electric [Ska86] and Xerox [Xer79] have reported in-house systems for evaluating PCB designs and assemblies. O'Grady et al. [OYGS91] developed a constraint-based system (LARRY) that addresses various life-cycle considerations during the design of printed wiring boards.

Reference-contexts: Gui et al. proposed [GM94] a bond graph-based system of assembly modeling from functional perspective. There are other research works related to functionality, design history, design rationale representation, many of which are worth noting <ref> [AY89, CGI93, CM92, KS89, Kle93, LA89, Sch89] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For this reason we include here a brief review of some representative systems of automated process planning. Computer-aided process planning is a key element in integrating design and manufacturing <ref> [AZ89] </ref>. Many attempts have been made to automate process planning of machined parts [CT92, AZ89, BW94, Cha90, Nau87, GRT92, WL91]. The two traditional types of approach to computer-aided process planning are the variant approach and generative approach. <p> For this reason we include here a brief review of some representative systems of automated process planning.

The variant approach involves retrieving an existing plan for a similar part and making the necessary modifications to the plan for the new part. <p> This section only deals with those steps that are relevant to manufacturability analysis. For details and a literature survey on the complete plan generation steps, readers are referred to <ref> [AZ89, Cha90, WL91] </ref>. 5.3.1 Process Selection Process knowledge involves the shape producing capability and technological constraints for each of the available machining processes. A variety of knowledge representation techniques are used to model process knowledge, with production rules and frames among the most popular.

Reference-contexts: To achieve this goal, increasing research attention is being directed toward the integration of engineering design and manufacturing. These attempts have led to the evolution of design for manufacturability (DFM) methodologies <ref> [Bak92] </ref>. DFM involves simultaneously considering design goals and manufacturing constraints in order to identify and alleviate manufacturing problems while the product is being designed; thereby reducing the lead time for product development and improving product quality. <p> Such inter-departmental design teams did not always work harmoniously and many management-related problems existed when building and coordinating such teams [OYGS91]. In an attempt to increase designers' awareness of manufacturing considerations, leading professional societies have published a number of manufacturability guidelines for a variety of manufacturing processes <ref> [Bak92, Bol49, Bra86, PB84, Tru87] </ref>. Some companies produced and used their own guidebooks for designers (one of the pioneers was General Electric [Ele60]). These guidelines enumerated design configurations that posed manufacturability problems and were intended as training tools in DFM. <p> As the advantages of concurrent engineering are being realized, more downstream activities associated with the various manufacturing aspects are being considered during the design phase|DFM is an important component in concurrent engineering environments <ref> [Whi90, Bak92] </ref>. One of the primary goals of concurrent engineering is to build an intelligent CAD system by embedding manufacturing related information into CAD systems.

Reference-contexts: Their system has a limited capability to perform geometric reasoning to identify interacting features but the effects of precedence constraints, tool changes, setup costs, etc., are not considered in their evaluation criteria. Other works in manufacturability analysis of PCBs include <ref> [RvT85, PD91, Str88, Bao88] </ref>. These efforts are for the most part for specific sub-domains of PCB manufacturing. Most are rule-based and, because of the fast pace of technological changes, these rule-bases need to be updated regularly.

Reference-contexts: These rule-based approaches represented a breakthrough over the existing state of the art. Currently, however, more plan-based evaluation systems are being developed in order to better reason about situations where the particular assembly sequence greatly affects assemblability. The pioneering work of Boothroyd and Dewhurst <ref> [BD83] </ref> in developing the design-for-assembly guidelines has resulted in several automated assembly evaluation and advisory systems [JP89, HGS93]. Swift [Swi81] also presented a methodology similar to that of Boothroyd and Dewhurst. <p> A proposed assembly sequence is used to perform fitting analysis. Sturges et al. [SK92] have developed a semiautomated assembly evaluation methodology that attempts to overcome some of the limitations of the scheme proposed by Boothroyd and De-whurst <ref> [BD83] </ref>. Currently, while lacking geometric reasoning capabilities, their system serves as an interactive environment to study the effect of various design configurations on assembly difficulty. Li and Hwang [LH92] did a study of design for assembly and developed a semi-automated system which closely follows the Boothroyd-Dewhurst methodology. <p> This system is one of the first approaches in plan based assemblability evaluation and redesign suggestion generation for assembly. There are limitations of this approach and compared to the work of Boothroyd and Dewhurst <ref> [BD83] </ref> their assemblability evaluation criteria are restricted. They do not consider tolerance and surface finish issues and can only suggest minor modifications to design. Also, in the absence of any model of the functional requirements of the product, the modified design may not satisfy the designer's intent.

Reference-contexts: In this way, they rely less on user input. Their system calculates a manufacturability index for individual components and fitting index between the components. Boothroyd <ref> [Boo94] </ref> presents a review of design for manufacture and assembly methodologies in use at different companies. 4.2 Machining Initially the efforts in machining sought to relate the different attributes of a part design to the manufacturing process so that design rules could be employed to asses manufacturability.

Reference-contexts: Evaluation is done hierarchically during the configuration and detailed design stages. In addition, they consider the functionality of the parts, tolerance information and also provide redesign suggestions. Finally, they also consider assembly of the components. Their approach integrates many phases of the design and manufacturing process. Bourne <ref> [Bou92] </ref> reports work at Carnegie-Mellon University toward an "Intelligent Bending Workstation." Being developed in the same line as CMU's earlier Intelligent Machining Workstation project, they are implementing an open architecture model for a bending controller in order to overcome the common difficulties posed by closed NC machine controllers.

Reference-contexts: This system does not investigate the possible alternative ways of machining the same part. Hitachi corporation [Miy91] extended their design for assembly methodology to also take into account machining processes. Together with their AEM method, this results in an overall pro-ducibility evaluation system. Boothroyd et al. <ref> [BR89] </ref> published a report on the evaluation of machining component during early design stage. They described two methodologies for arriving at cost estimates. The first methodology takes into account only part and stock geometry, batch size, material and component type. The second methodology uses more shop floor information.

A tolerance chart is a tool for assessing machining accuracy. It is a graphical representation of the process sequence which helps to visualize the influence of the proposed sequence on resulting dimensions and tolerances.

Backward planning strategies have been successfully used to select the multiple operations needed for certain features. A number of process planning systems, among them AMPS <ref> [Cha90] </ref>, SIPS [Nau87], use this technique to perform process selection. 5.3.2 Identifying Precedence Constraints For a given part, the machining operations cannot be necessarily performed in any arbitrary order [GNRZ94].

Geometric and technological constraints will require that certain operations be performed before or after other operations. AMPS [Cha90] uses heuristic techniques to determine precedence constraints among features. A number of rules based on machining practices have been defined and are used to determine 17 precedence constraints among pairs of features. This approach allows for strict and loose constraints. <p> Setup planning involves determining the various setups in which the part will be machined. While advances have been made in automated fixture design [Sak], existing research has mainly focused on designing new fixtures for a given geometry. Chang <ref> [Cha90] </ref> presented comprehensive conditions for holding the workpiece in a vise. These conditions are based on the intermediate workpiece geometry and are sufficient for successfully clamping the workpiece. <p> Plan rating involves assigning a merit to the plan. If alternative plans exist, ratings are used to select the best plan. Economics plays an important role in manufacturing planning. Estimation of cost and time has been an integral part of process planning activities <ref> [Cha90] </ref> and extensive research in machining economics has produced quantitative models for evaluating times and costs related to machining operations [Win89]. <p> In such cases, empirical methods are often used.

There are additional works reported by researchers on various types of net shape manufacturing, including injection molding <ref> [Dew87, GGH + 91, IKD89, PC89, RDPD92, GS94] </ref>, die casting [DB89], sheet metal work [TOHY85, ZD88, dSLEE93], casting [LDS86], powder metallurgy [Kni91], extrusion [HG86] and stamping [MPRW93].

Reference-contexts: The rating is based on estimated machining time for the part. Based on this approach, Das et al. <ref> [DGN94] </ref> reported a methodology of suggesting improvements to a given design to reduce the number of setups to machine a part. Their approach involved using different machining operations to satisfy the geometric constraints put on the part by the designer. These constraints are based on the functionality of the part. <p> Also, existing systems usually do not take into account how the proposed changes will affect the functionality of the design. This will require the systems to be integrated with some form of functionality representation scheme and manufacturing database. Some work is being done to overcome both of these drawbacks <ref> [DGN94] </ref>, but it is still in the early stages. 8. Product life-cycle considerations. For more comprehensive analysis of the total cost of a product, other life-cycle cost considerations also have to be taken into account [Ish94, IEH93].

Ishii and his colleagues have built a number of design advisory systems using this approach. El-Gizawy et al. <ref> [EGHB90] </ref> presented a system which considers the suitability of different manufacturing processes for a given part based on a process capability database. Once a process is chosen, two types of analysis are performed: first a rule based analysis using knowledge- and rule-base, at which stage redesign suggestions are provided. <p> Projects such as <ref> [SU94, EGHB90] </ref> address this problem by analyzing manufac-turability using data obtained from process models and manufacturing simulations.

For this reason we include here a brief review of some representative systems of automated process planning. <p> In certain cases, there might be a large number of alternatives, making it infeasible to consider all of them. In order to preserve computational efficiency in such cases, methods are needed to discard unpromising alternatives while still producing correct results. Gupta and Nau <ref> [GN95] </ref> provide an approach to this problem in the context of machined parts|but methods still need to be developed for other manufacturing domains. 3. Virtual enterprises and distributed manufacturing. Manufacturing industries are relying increasingly on distributed manufacturing enterprises organized around multi-enterprise partnerships. <p> For helping designers and managers to make engineering and financial decisions, ratings of a qualitative or abstract nature will not be particularly useful|instead, the manufacturability ratings will need to reflect the cost and time needed to manufacture a proposed product, as done in <ref> [GN95] </ref>. We expect that future manufacturability rating schemes will not only represent production time and cost, but also provide detailed breakdowns of the time and cost of manufacturing various portions of the design.

Reference-contexts: This approach is useful in domains such as near-net shape manufacturing. However, it is less suitable for machined or electro-mechanical components, in which interactions among manufacturing operations can make it difficult to determine the manufacturability of a design directly from the design description. * In indirect or plan-based approaches <ref> [HDW89, HS94, HGS93] </ref> the first step is to generate a manufacturing plan, and modify various portions of the plan in order to reduce its cost. If there is more than one possible plan, then the most promising plan should be used for analyzing manufacturability. <p> Some systems provide detailed decomposition of the manufacturability ratings of various design attributes [GN95]. A few systems provide, along with the manufacturability rating, redesign suggestions to improve the design. Usually these are suggestions to change parameters of various design features [SD89], but some systems <ref> [HDW89] </ref> present redesign suggestions as complete redesigned parts. 4 Representative Systems The manufacturability of a design is strongly dependent on the manufacturing processes used to create it. For example, a design that has an ideal shape for casting may not be suitable for machining.

Reference-contexts: This approach is useful in domains such as near-net shape manufacturing. However, it is less suitable for machined or electro-mechanical components, in which interactions among manufacturing operations can make it difficult to determine the manufacturability of a design directly from the design description. * In indirect or plan-based approaches <ref> [HDW89, HS94, HGS93] </ref> the first step is to generate a manufacturing plan, and modify various portions of the plan in order to reduce its cost. If there is more than one possible plan, then the most promising plan should be used for analyzing manufacturability. <p> Currently, however, more plan-based evaluation systems are being developed in order to better reason about situations where the particular assembly sequence greatly affects assemblability. The pioneering work of Boothroyd and Dewhurst [BD83] in developing the design-for-assembly guidelines has resulted in several automated assembly evaluation and advisory systems <ref> [JP89, HGS93] </ref>.

The task of automated redesign is presented as a future goal. Hsu et al. <ref> [HGS93] </ref> developed an approach to design-for-assembly that examines and evaluates assembly plans using three criteria: parallelism, assemblability, and redundancy. They evaluate assembly plans in an attempt to find problems with the assembly and, when possible, introduce modifications to improve the plan.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, an analytic and experimental process simulation is performed to determine the time required to produce the part and its material requirements. The methodology also includes in its cost calculation the machining cost after a net shape process.

To address such problems, manufacturability analysis systems will need the ability to generate redesign suggestions. Most existing approaches for generating redesign suggestions <ref> [Ish93, SD89, HK91] </ref> propose design changes on a piecemeal basis, (e.g., by suggesting changes to individual feature parameters)|but because of interactions among various portions of the design, sometimes it is not possible to improve the manufacturability of the design without proposing a judiciously chosen combination of modifications.

Current research on computer-aided tolerance charting focuses on calculation of optimum intermediate tolerances typically using linear programming techniques. In near net shape processes and electro-mechanical component assemblies, the process physics often determine the accuracy and quality of the parts. <p> Design tolerances are important aspect of the design and significantly affect manufacturability|but most existing systems have limited capabilities for analyzing the manufacturability of design tolerances. For example, most work on automated tolerance charting <ref> [Ji93, MIL90] </ref> focuses mainly on computing the optimum intermediate tolerances and has not been integrated with manufacturability analysis systems.

Usually the designer, based on what is commercially available, selects components; this selection in turn dictates the production method.

Reference-contexts: Warnecke and Bassler [WB88] studied both functional and assembly characteristics. Parts with low functional value but high assembly difficulty receive low scores, while parts with high 7 functionality and low assembly cost receive high scores. The scoring is used to guide the redesign process. Miles et al. <ref> [MS92] </ref> developed an assembly evaluation method in which parts are divided into two groups based on functional importance: "category A" parts are required from the design specification, and "category B" parts are accessories. The goal of the method is to eliminate as many "category B" parts as possible through redesign.

Reference-contexts: For this reason we include here a brief review of some representative systems of automated process planning. Computer-aided process planning is a key element in integrating design and manufacturing [AZ89]. Many attempts have been made to automate process planning of machined parts <ref> [CT92, AZ89, BW94, Cha90, Nau87, GRT92, WL91] </ref>. The two traditional types of approach to computer-aided process planning are the variant approach and generative approach. The variant approach involves retrieving an existing plan for a similar part and making the necessary modifications to the plan for the new part. <p> Production rules involve condition-action sets, and are often expressed in the from of IF-THEN rules. Examples of systems using production rules include XCUT [BW94] and AMPS [Cha90]. Frames can represent both procedural and declarative information in terms of attributes, hierarchical relations with other frames, constraints, and procedures. SIPS <ref> [Nau87] </ref> and NEXT-Cut [CT92] use frames to represent process knowledge. The process selection task is performed by examining the shape and tolerance requirements of an individual feature and selecting a process that is capable of meeting the requirements. <p> Quite often, a feature needs a roughing operation followed by one or more finishing operations. Backward planning strategies have been successfully used to select the multiple operations needed for certain features. A number of process planning systems, among them AMPS [Cha90], SIPS <ref> [Nau87] </ref>, use this technique to perform process selection. 5.3.2 Identifying Precedence Constraints For a given part, the machining operations cannot be necessarily performed in any arbitrary order [GNRZ94]. Geometric and technological constraints will require that certain operations be performed before or after other operations.

Reference-contexts: In such environments, manufacturability analysis cannot be done accurately without taking into account the capabilities of the various partners that one might potentially use in order to manufacture the product. Projects are underway to address this problem (e.g., <ref> [NBG + 94] </ref>), but the work in this area is still largely in its early stages. 4. Process models and virtual manufacturing.

Reference-contexts: In other efforts, the goals were specific to a class of products where the design attributes and functionality are intimately coupled. Nielsen et al. <ref> [NDZ91] </ref> reported a system for iterative design where functionality is represented as the target values for different parameters. Thompson et al. [TL89] proposed a methodology for representing design rationale.

Reference-contexts: In some systems (e.g., [JPU85]), the designer may need to enter a feature-based representation of the design in terms of the particular feature library used by the system. In more sophisticated systems, <ref> [NLR93a] </ref> the system works directly from the solid model of the design. If needed, feature-based representations are generated automatically. * Amount and type of feedback information. Most manufacturability analysis systems provide some kind of manufacturability rating of the design.

Reference-contexts: This system will be customizable and extendable, allowing for future incorporation of additional modules. Nnaji et al. <ref> [NLR93b] </ref> reported development of a complete product modeler for concurrent engineering. This modeling system builds product model with assembly, dimensioning and functionality consideration. It follows a set of part-to-part relations defined for assembly operations based on standard spatial relationships. The modeler also does manufacturability analysis for sheet-metal work and assembly. <p> Ability to handle multiple processes. Many products are produced using a combination of different kinds of processes. For example, engine blocks are first cast, and then machined to final shape. Systems are being developed that handle more than one kind of manufacturing process <ref> [Ish93, NLR93b, SR94] </ref>. However, manufacturability requirements for different processes are often in conflict. For example, a design shape that is easy to cast may pose problems when fixturing it for machining. It will be necessary to develop ways to handle such conflicts. 2. Alternative manufacturing plans.

Reference-contexts: However, most of these systems do not automatically generate the complete set of precedence constraints. Precedence constraints are also important in generating and evaluating alternative assembly sequences. De Fazio and Whitney <ref> [DW87, NW89] </ref> provide some examples of that. 5.3.3 Fixturability and Setup Planning To ensure successful machining, each intermediate workpiece shape should be fixturable. This requires consideration of fixturing devices and formulating the conditions that are needed to insure proper fixturing.

Zhang et al. presented <ref> [ZK91a, ZK91b, NZG92, ZH90] </ref> a comprehensive method for predicting the machining accuracy of turning and boring operations. Their methodology can be extended to model all machining processes involving single-point cutting tools. In complex machining operations, developing mathematical models is a very difficult task.

Reference-contexts: In these design projects, manufacturing engineers participated in the design process from the beginning and made suggestions about possible ways of improving manufacturability [GF90, Hol9o]. Such inter-departmental design teams did not always work harmoniously and many management-related problems existed when building and coordinating such teams <ref> [OYGS91] </ref>. In an attempt to increase designers' awareness of manufacturing considerations, leading professional societies have published a number of manufacturability guidelines for a variety of manufacturing processes [Bak92, Bol49, Bra86, PB84, Tru87]. Some companies produced and used their own guidebooks for designers (one of the pioneers was General Electric [Ele60]). <p> Similar to design for assembly, many major electronic manufacturers have taken the lead in developing metrics for evaluation of printed circuit board designs. NEC corporation [AKKI85], General Electric [Ska86] and Xerox [Xer79] have reported in-house systems for evaluating PCB designs and assemblies. O'Grady et al. <ref> [OYGS91] </ref> developed a constraint-based system (LARRY) that addresses various life-cycle considerations during the design of printed wiring boards. They treat the design process as a constraint satisfaction problem where the various manufacturability considerations are represented as a constraint network.

Reference-contexts: These three characteristics are described further below: 1. Approach. For analyzing the manufacturability of a design, the existing approaches can be classified roughly as follows: * In direct or rule-based approaches <ref> [Ish93, JP89, RDPD92] </ref>, rules are used to identify infeasible design attributes from direct inspection of the design description. This approach is useful in domains such as near-net shape manufacturing. <p> The cost of any part depends on the processing method with a rating calculated by examination of alternative processing methods. Cost is determined by using a combination of different processes and materials.

Reference-contexts: Marefat argues that his approach is complete over a class of polyhedral features, i.e., that it generates all features in his class that can be found from the geometry of a part. Another recent approach [TK94] addresses completeness over a limited domain of iso-oriented polygonal parts. Regli et al. <ref> [RGN94, RN93] </ref> present a methodology for specifying the feature recognition problem and proving it is complete over a well-defined class of parts. Their features are based on a class of machining features that describe operations on three-axis machining centers and encompass a realistic class of parts bounded by analytic surfaces. <p> Many aspects of the feature recognition problem are still open and active areas of research. Among these are: recognizing and representing interacting features [VR93], incremental recognition of features [HR94], modeling alternative feature interpretations <ref> [MK90, RGN94] </ref>, reasoning about the manufacturability of features [GN95, GKN + 94], and incorporation of user customizable feature classes. 16 5.3 Generative Process Planning As mentioned in previous sections, many of the manufacturability evaluation systems use manufacturing plans to evaluate manufacturability.

Reference-contexts: In another effort to to address combinatorial problems and handle realistic industrial designs, Gadh and Prinz [GP92] describe techniques for abstracting an approximation of the geometric and topological information in a solid model and finding features in the approximation. More recently, Regli et al. <ref> [RGN95] </ref> have outlined methods to utilize multiple distributed processors. Their initial results show that multi-processor techniques can be effectively employed to expand the class of mechanical designs that are feasible and produce improvements in system response times. <p> Achieving interactivity requires an increasingly sophisticated allocation of computational resources in order to perform realistic design analyses and generate feedback in real time <ref> [RGN95] </ref>. With these criteria in mind, we present some specific issues that are important for future manufac turability analysis systems to address: 1. Ability to handle multiple processes. Many products are produced using a combination of different kinds of processes. <p> Achieving high accuracy, comprehensive results, and fast response time will require the development of new methodologies for distributed systems integration for manufacturing applications <ref> [RGN95] </ref>. 10. System validation. Very little has been reported about system validation in actual industrial settings. In order to asses effectiveness of automated manufacturability analysis systems, we will need in-depth testing and validations of such systems in industry. 11. Human Computer Interaction.

Reference-contexts: This requires consideration of fixturing devices and formulating the conditions that are needed to insure proper fixturing. Setup planning involves determining the various setups in which the part will be machined. While advances have been made in automated fixture design <ref> [Sak] </ref>, existing research has mainly focused on designing new fixtures for a given geometry. Chang [Cha90] presented comprehensive conditions for holding the workpiece in a vise. These conditions are based on the intermediate workpiece geometry and are sufficient for successfully clamping the workpiece.

Reference-contexts: Extension of this method from polyhedra to the more general surfaces required for realistic parts is currently under investigation [MK94].

Reference-contexts: Some systems provide detailed decomposition of the manufacturability ratings of various design attributes [GN95]. A few systems provide, along with the manufacturability rating, redesign suggestions to improve the design. Usually these are suggestions to change parameters of various design features <ref> [SD89] </ref>, but some systems [HDW89] present redesign suggestions as complete redesigned parts. 4 Representative Systems The manufacturability of a design is strongly dependent on the manufacturing processes used to create it. For example, a design that has an ideal shape for casting may not be suitable for machining. <p> This is particularly true for cases where the part is manufactured by multiple manufacturing methods or is produced by a supplier. To address such problems, manufacturability analysis systems will need the ability to generate redesign suggestions. Most existing approaches for generating redesign suggestions <ref> [Ish93, SD89, HK91] </ref> propose design changes on a piecemeal basis, (e.g., by suggesting changes to individual feature parameters)|but because of interactions among various portions of the design, sometimes it is not possible to improve the manufacturability of the design without proposing a judiciously chosen combination of modifications.

Reference-contexts: This type of scheme involves rating a design by assigning numerical ratings along some abstract scale. For example, Shankar et al. <ref> [SJ93] </ref> proposed a scheme in which each design attribute was assigned a manufacturability index between 1 and 2. Just as with qualitative measuring schemes, it can be difficult to interpret such measures or to compare and combine them. 5 * Time and cost. <p> There are additional works reported by researchers on various types of net shape manufacturing, including injection molding [Dew87, GGH + 91, IKD89, PC89, RDPD92, GS94], die casting [DB89], sheet metal work [TOHY85, ZD88, dSLEE93], casting [LDS86], powder metallurgy [Kni91], extrusion [HG86] and stamping [MPRW93]. Shankar et al. <ref> [SJ93] </ref> proposed a domain independent methodology to evaluate the manufactura-bility of designs based on a set of five core manufacturability concepts: compatibility, complexity, quality, efficiency, and coupling. Based on each of these concepts, they assign a manufacturability index to various attributes of the design.

Sturges et al. <ref> [SK92] </ref> have developed a semiautomated assembly evaluation methodology that attempts to overcome some of the limitations of the scheme proposed by Boothroyd and De-whurst [BD83].

Reference-contexts: While ideal systems for manufacturability analysis are 10 plan-based, rules are often better suited for certain sub-problems within this domain. Similar to design for assembly, many major electronic manufacturers have taken the lead in developing metrics for evaluation of printed circuit board designs. NEC corporation [AKKI85], General Electric <ref> [Ska86] </ref> and Xerox [Xer79] have reported in-house systems for evaluating PCB designs and assemblies. O'Grady et al.

Reference-contexts: Currently the trend is towards plan-based systems. Earlier methods, with abstract rating schemes, are also yielding to more direct measures like time and cost. Due to the different kinds of variables involved in the machining process, this remains the most challenging domain. Lu and Subramanyan <ref> [SL91] </ref> developed a manufacturability evaluation system for bearing cages. They addressed several aspects of the manufacturability problem including fixturing, tooling, gaging, and material handling. They used a multiple cooperative knowledge sources paradigm that separated domain knowledge from the control procedure.

Reference-contexts: This, in turn, limited their capacity for handling complex design shapes. In recent years, the functional capabilities of commercial systems have vastly improved. These new enhancements, coupled with the advent of parametric design systems 2 and open-architecture solid modeling systems <ref> [Spa93] </ref>, facilitate implementation of the complex geometric reasoning techniques and systems integration required for realistic manu-facturability analysis.

For example, engine blocks are first cast, and then machined to final shape. Systems are being developed that handle more than one kind of manufacturing process <ref> [Ish93, NLR93b, SR94] </ref>. However, manufacturability requirements for different processes are often in conflict. For example, a design shape that is easy to cast may pose problems when fixturing it for machining. It will be necessary to develop ways to handle such conflicts. 2. Alternative manufacturing plans.

Reference-contexts: The system is interactive, alerting the designer of the rule violations and giving suggestions for 12 modifications. Finally the system allows only the design of manufacturable components. Balasubramaniam et al. <ref> [SU94] </ref> proposed a method for developing producibility metrics for process-physics dominated production processes such as extrusion, injection molding etc. Their approach predicts the likelihood of common manufacturing defects based on different physical characteristics of the design. <p> Current research on computer-aided tolerance charting focuses on calculation of optimum intermediate tolerances typically using linear programming techniques. In near net shape processes and electro-mechanical component assemblies, the process physics often determine the accuracy and quality of the parts. Balasubramaniam et al. <ref> [SU94] </ref> provides some methods for determining possible manufacturing defects in aluminum extrusion. Similar works are also reported in other manufacturing processes. 6 Discussion Today's marketplace is characterized by increasing global competition, shrinking product lifetimes, and increasing product complexity. <p> Projects such as <ref> [SU94, EGHB90] </ref> address this problem by analyzing manufac-turability using data obtained from process models and manufacturing simulations. Some of the problems remaining to be solved include the development of better and up-to-date process models, and better integration of process models with manufacturability evaluation methods. 20 5. Manufacturability rating schemes. <p> For such purposes, manufacturing-handbook data will not necessarily be accurate enough; instead, company-specific data (obtained, for example, via virtual <ref> [SU94, EGHB90] </ref> and physical [EGHB90, ZK91b] simulations) will be needed. 6. Accounting for design tolerances. Designers note dimensional and geometric tolerances on a design to specify the permissible variations from the nominal geometry that will be compatible with the design's functionality.

Reference-contexts: Although product design incurs only a small fraction of the total product cost, the decisions made during the design phase account for a significant portion of this cost [Ull92] and prove crucial to the success or failure of the product <ref> [Suh92, Whi90] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Such inter-departmental design teams did not always work harmoniously and many management-related problems existed when building and coordinating such teams [OYGS91]. In an attempt to increase designers' awareness of manufacturing considerations, leading professional societies have published a number of manufacturability guidelines for a variety of manufacturing processes <ref> [Bak92, Bol49, Bra86, PB84, Tru87] </ref>. Some companies produced and used their own guidebooks for designers (one of the pioneers was General Electric [Ele60]). These guidelines enumerated design configurations that posed manufacturability problems and were intended as training tools in DFM. <p> In such cases, empirical methods are often used. Kline et al. [KDS82] proposed a system for predicting machining accuracy in end milling. Based on the past experiences of metal cutting industries, a significant amount of data has been published that describes the achievable machining accuracy of various machining processes <ref> [Bra86, Tru87, Cha90] </ref>. A tolerance chart is a tool for assessing machining accuracy. It is a graphical representation of the process sequence which helps to visualize the influence of the proposed sequence on resulting dimensions and tolerances.

Vandenbrande's work, using a knowledge-based approach like that of Dong and Wozny, provides a framework for recognizing machining features and building process plans via artificial intelligence techniques in combination with queries to a solid modeler. <p> Other related work includes feature recognition from 2D engineering drawings [MP93], feature recognition for sheet-metal components [LS93], and feature modeling by incremental recognition [LM93]. Many aspects of the feature recognition problem are still open and active areas of research. Among these are: recognizing and representing interacting features <ref> [VR93] </ref>, incremental recognition of features [HR94], modeling alternative feature interpretations [MK90, RGN94], reasoning about the manufacturability of features [GN95, GKN + 94], and incorporation of user customizable feature classes. 16 5.3 Generative Process Planning As mentioned in previous sections, many of the manufacturability evaluation systems use manufacturing plans to evaluate manufacturability.

Reference-contexts: Economics plays an important role in manufacturing planning. Estimation of cost and time has been an integral part of process planning activities [Cha90] and extensive research in machining economics has produced quantitative models for evaluating times and costs related to machining operations <ref> [Win89] </ref>. Various optimization techniques have been applied to these quantitative models to determine the machining parameters which minimize the variable cost, or maximize the production rate and profit rate [Aga92a, Aga92b, DH91, ZL90]. 18 Each machining operation creates a feature which has certain geometric variations compared to its nominal geometry.

Reference-contexts: For this reason we include here a brief review of some representative systems of automated process planning. Computer-aided process planning is a key element in integrating design and manufacturing [AZ89]. Many attempts have been made to automate process planning of machined parts <ref> [CT92, AZ89, BW94, Cha90, Nau87, GRT92, WL91] </ref>. The two traditional types of approach to computer-aided process planning are the variant approach and generative approach. The variant approach involves retrieving an existing plan for a similar part and making the necessary modifications to the plan for the new part. <p> This section only deals with those steps that are relevant to manufacturability analysis. For details and a literature survey on the complete plan generation steps, readers are referred to <ref> [AZ89, Cha90, WL91] </ref>. 5.3.1 Process Selection Process knowledge involves the shape producing capability and technological constraints for each of the available machining processes. A variety of knowledge representation techniques are used to model process knowledge, with production rules and frames among the most popular. <p> For a limited number of machining processes, deterministic models have been developed to provide quantitative mappings between the cutting parameters (such as cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut) and machining accuracy (such as surface finish and dimensional accuracy) <ref> [WL91, NZGK93, ZK91a, ZK91b] </ref>. Zhang et al. presented [ZK91a, ZK91b, NZG92, ZH90] a comprehensive method for predicting the machining accuracy of turning and boring operations. Their methodology can be extended to model all machining processes involving single-point cutting tools.

Reference-contexts: More recently, Regli et al. [RGN95] have outlined methods to utilize multiple distributed processors. Their initial results show that multi-processor techniques can be effectively employed to expand the class of mechanical designs that are feasible and produce improvements in system response times. Woo <ref> [Woo82] </ref>, in an early effort on feature extraction, proposed a method for finding general depression and protrusion features on a part through decomposing the convex hull of the solid model.

In complex machining operations, developing mathematical models is a very difficult task. <p> For such purposes, manufacturing-handbook data will not necessarily be accurate enough; instead, company-specific data (obtained, for example, via virtual [SU94, EGHB90] and physical <ref> [EGHB90, ZK91b] </ref> simulations) will be needed. 6. Accounting for design tolerances. Designers note dimensional and geometric tolerances on a design to specify the permissible variations from the nominal geometry that will be compatible with the design's functionality.

Reference-contexts: Various optimization techniques have been applied to these quantitative models to determine the machining parameters which minimize the variable cost, or maximize the production rate and profit rate <ref> [Aga92a, Aga92b, DH91, ZL90] </ref>. 18 Each machining operation creates a feature which has certain geometric variations compared to its nominal geometry. Designers normally give design tolerance specifications on the nominal geometry to specify how large these variations are allowed to be.

Reference-contexts: To industry and end-users, it will provide insight into a new and evolving family of software tools and expedite the transfer of these new technologies to commercial systems from academic prototypes. 2 Historical Perspective The roots of DFM date back to World War II <ref> [ZS93] </ref>, when scarcity of resources, coupled with constant social and political pressure to build better weapons in the shortest possible turnaround time, were the main motivating factors behind the tight integration of design and manufacturing activities. <p> Many of the successful weapons of that period were designed by small, integrated, multi-disciplinary teams <ref> [ZS93] </ref>. With the post-World War II era of prosperity and the rapid industrial growth, design and manufacturing were segregated into distinct departments; resulting in a sequential product development environment with little attention to DFM.
