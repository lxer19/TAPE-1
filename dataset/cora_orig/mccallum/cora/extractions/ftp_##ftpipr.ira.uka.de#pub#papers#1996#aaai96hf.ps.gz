Abstract: Currently, an important topic of robotic research is the design and development of `service robots'. These devices shall work autonomously or in cooperation with humans in a dynamic, relatively unstructured environment like households or offices. A crucial component of such systems is the programming interface. Programming methods have to be developed that enable an operator who is not a programming expert to easily instruct the robot. Programming by Demonstration (PbD) offers a way to accomplish this task. In this paper, we describe the results of two research projects that dealt with the application of PbD in the field of robotics. Furthermore, we outline the design methodology for an integrated system providing an interactive robot programming interface based on demonstrations and the analysis of user intentions.

Reference-contexts: These two aspects have to be taken into account to build robot systems that are able to acquire human action knowledge from observing human performance and to establish a suitable communication link to the user. For meeting these goals the Programming by Demonstration (PbD) paradigm <ref> (Cypher 1993) </ref> seems to be the right way to follow. After an overview about the state-of-the-art in Robot Programming by Demonstration (RPD) and Robot Skill Acquisition via Human Demonstration, this paper does present the results of two research projects related to RPD and Learning in Robotics.

Reference-contexts: An analysis of the problems arising from the varying quality of user demonstrations in the robotics domain and ways to cope with these was presented in <ref> (Kaiser, Friedrich, & Dillmann 1995) </ref>. Several projects that were concerned with the application of the PbD paradigm to robot programming were carried out at the IPR.

Thus the user intended generalization takes place. The process of fusing a single demonstration with the users intentions is described in great detail in <ref> (Friedrich & Dillmann 1995) </ref>. A methodology for robust transfer of human knowledge employing PbD To combine the results achieved in the previously described projects, a system integrating the developed techniques is currently under construction. The applied design methodology is described below.

Reference-contexts: Vector Sequences to Symbolic Operators - a robust transformation According to the first task described above, an analysis of the vector trace representing a demonstration is necessary to transform the "raw demonstration data" into the symbolic format of the planning language. The chosen planning language consists of STRIPS-like Operators <ref> (Fikes, Hart, & Nilsson 1972) </ref> that are Basic Operators (BOs) (e.g. transfer, grip, approach, ...) and instructions describing branches and loops. A single demonstration is firstly transformed into a sequence of BOs that is developed into a more complex structure by several subsequent learning modules.

Reference-contexts: Another aspect also common to the speech recognition domain is that of time variations in the signal (the demonstration). In the domain of speech recognition, Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNNs) have been proven to be powerful tools for various segmentation and classification problems <ref> (Waibel et al. 1989) </ref>, overcoming also the problem of time variations in the input signal. Therefore, the application of TDNNs was considered for the solution of the analysis problem in the RPD system. The demonstration's vector sequence is fed simultaneously into several TDNNs (one for each BO).
