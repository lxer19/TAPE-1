Abstract: We prove (n 2 ) complexity lower bound for the general model of randomized computation trees solving the Knapsack Problem, and more generally Restricted Integer Programming. This is the first nontrivial lower bound proven for this model of computation. The method of the proof depends crucially on the new technique for proving lower bounds on the border complexity of a polynomial which could be of independent y Dept. of Computer Science, University of Bonn, 53117 Bonn, and the International Computer Science Institute, Berkeley.

Reference-contexts: In [BKL93] (cf. also [GKMS96]), a linear depth RCT was constructed for a similar problem (permutation problem) f (x; y) 2 IR 2n : y is a permutation of xg beating therefore its deterministic (n log n) lower bound (cf. <ref> [B83] </ref>). This example shows that the (still open problem) of complexity of an RCT for the Element Distinctness is quite delicate. <p> The "topological" methods based on the number of connected components ([SY82], <ref> [B83] </ref>), or more general, on the sum of Betti numbers ([BLY92], [Y94]), provide the lower bound (n 2 ) for the Knapsack Problem and the lower bound (n log n) for the Element Distinctness Problem or the Permutation Problem. <p> The latter is less than 2 O (s+k) according to [W68] and Tarski's transfer principle (see above). The proposition is proved. 2 Lower bounds for randomized computation trees Recall (see e.g. <ref> [B83] </ref>) that in the computation tree (CT ) testing polynomials are computed along paths using the elementary arithmetic operations.

Reference-contexts: 0 Introduction We prove for the first time nonlinear lower bounds on the depth of randomized computation trees (RCT s) (see e.g. [MT82], [S83], [M85a], <ref> [GKMS96] </ref>) recognizing sets like unions of hyperplanes (i.e. linear arrangements) or intersections of halfspaces (polyhedra). As an application we prove a quadratic lower bound on RCT s solving the knapsack problem, or more generally, the restricted integer programming. <p> Obtaining general lower bounds for randomized computation was an open question for a long time (see e.g. [MT82], [S83], [M85a, b, c], [KV88], [CKKLW95]). Only recently, a nonlinear lower bound was proven in <ref> [GKMS96] </ref> for a weaker model of randomized d-decision trees (d-RDT s), in which testing polynomials have degrees at most d (for 2-dimensional case the lower bound was proven in [GK93], and for the generic arrangements a lower bound was proved in [GK94]). <p> Therefore, we develop in the present paper a new method for obtaining complexity lower bounds for RCT s. The method developed in the present paper cannot be directly applied for the Element Distinctness Problem. In [BKL93] (cf. also <ref> [GKMS96] </ref>), a linear depth RCT was constructed for a similar problem (permutation problem) f (x; y) 2 IR 2n : y is a permutation of xg beating therefore its deterministic (n log n) lower bound (cf. [B83]). <p> We also mention that a linear n 4 lower bound for an RCT recognizing the arrangement S 1in fX i = 0g or the "orthant" T 1in fX i 0g was proved in <ref> [GKMS96] </ref>. <p> In section 2 we prove the main theorem which provides a lower bound for an RCT testing an arrangement or a polyhedron. For that purpose we use some tools (in particular, the tree of flags) from <ref> [GKMS96] </ref>, but the proof is different since the degree of RCT s could be exponential as we already mentioned. <p> For any polynomial f 2 IR [X 1 ; : : : ; X n ] rewrite it in the coordinates f (Z 1 ; : : :; Z k ; Y 1 ; : : : ; Y nk ) and following <ref> [GKMS96] </ref>, define its leading term lm (f ) = ffZ 0 1 Z 0 k Y m 1 m nk 0 6= ff 2 IR (with respect to the coordinate system Z 1 ; : : :; Z k ; Y 1 ; : : : ; Y nk ) as <p> The leading term lm (f (l) ) = ffZ m 1 m k 1 Y nkl , we refer to this equality as the maintenance property (see also <ref> [GKMS96] </ref>). 3 Denote by V ar (f ) = V ar (H 1 ;:::;H nk ) (f ) the number of positive (i.e. nonzero) integers among m nk ; : : :; m 1 . <p> It is convenient (see also <ref> [GKMS96] </ref>) to reformulate the introduced concepts by means of infinitesimals. <p> Then for any RCT recognizing S, its depth is greater than (n log m). Before proceeding to the proof of the theorem, we need some preparation. First we fix the canonical representation of k-face in two cases: namely, of S and of S + , respectively (see <ref> [GKMS96] </ref>). <p> As the representation of we take the flag of planes: H i nk H i nk " H i nk1 H i nk " " H i 1 = . Now consider the case of S + . One can prove (see <ref> [GKMS96] </ref>) that for any k-face there exists a flag which we treat as a canonical representation of : H i nk H i nk " H i nk1 H i nk " " H i 1 = such that for each 1 l k H i nk " " H i <p> The following lemma was proved in <ref> [GKMS96] </ref>. <p> An analogue of lemma 2 from <ref> [GKMS96] </ref> is the following lemma. Lemma 2: Let S = S or S = S + satisfy the condition 2. of the theorem. <p> The proof of lemma 2 differs from the proof of the analogous lemma 2 from <ref> [GKMS96] </ref> proved for d-decision trees, in which the degrees of the testing polynomials do not exceed d, rather than computation trees (considered in the present paper), in which the degrees of the testing polynomials could be exponential in the depth t of CT. <p> We arrange the representing flags of all these k-faces in a tree T which we call the tree of flags (cf. the proof of lemma 2 from <ref> [GKMS96] </ref>). T has a root with the zero level, each its path has the same length n k (such trees are called regular), some of its vertices are labeled. We construct T by induction on the level of its vertices. The base of induction. <p> 0; 1 i ng (so on the other side of H) with a vertex in v 1 , this implies the strict inequality in the remark. 4 Open Problem We were not able to prove any superlinear lower bound or a linear upper bound on the Element Distinctness (cf. [M85a], <ref> [GKMS96] </ref>) for randomized computational trees. Note that the corresponding lower bound for randomized decision trees is (n log n), [GKMS96].

Obtaining general lower bounds for randomized computation was an open question for a long time (see e.g. [MT82], <ref> [S83] </ref>, [M85a, b, c], [KV88], [CKKLW95]). <p> In particular, for a testing polynomial f i 2 IR [X 1 ; : : : ; X n ] at the level i (assuming that the root has the zero level) we have C (f i ) i. Under RCT (cf. [MT82], <ref> [S83] </ref>, [M85a,b,c]) we mean a collection of CT T = fT ff g and a probabilistic vector p ff 0, P ff p ff = 1 such that T ff is chosen with the probability p ff .

Reference-contexts: We now briefly describe the content of the paper. In section 1 we introduce the notion of the border complexity of a polynomial generalizing the notion of the border rank of a tensor, cf. <ref> [S90] </ref>, [B79], [BCLR79], and prove a lower bound on it in terms of the number of connected components, which could be of independent interest. In section 2 we prove the main theorem which provides a lower bound for an RCT testing an arrangement or a polyhedron. <p> Following e.g. <ref> [S90] </ref> we define the complexity s = C (f ) of a polynomial f 2 IR [X 1 ; : : : ; X n ] as the length of the shortest straight-line program which computes f . <p> For a polynomial g 2 IR [Z 1 ; : : : ; Z k ] its border complexity C (g) (cf. <ref> [S90] </ref> for the notion of the border rank ) is the minimal C (f ) where f 2 IR [X 1 ; : : : ; X n ] for a certain n k such that g = f (nk) , for suitable coordinates Z 1 ; : : : ;

Reference-contexts: For an element b 2 IR n+2 for brevity denote the standard part st i (b) = st " i+1 (st " i+2 (st " n+2 (b) ) 2 IR i (provided that it is definable). Also we will use the Tarski's transfer principle <ref> [T51] </ref>. Namely, for two real closed fields F 1 F 2 a closed (so, without free variables) formula in the language of the first-order theory of F 1 is true over F 1 if and only if this formula is true over F 2 .

Reference-contexts: 2 F [X 1 ; : : : ; X n ] have the degrees deg (f i ) d, has at most (minf2 k ; ( k n ) n gd n ) O (1) connected components (cf. [GV88]), relying on this bound in case F = IR from <ref> [W68] </ref> (cf. also [BPR94]), which strenghtens the result of [M64]. Another application of Tarski's transfer principle is the concept of the completion. <p> The latter is less than 2 O (s+k) according to <ref> [W68] </ref> and Tarski's transfer principle (see above). The proposition is proved. 2 Lower bounds for randomized computation trees Recall (see e.g. [B83]) that in the computation tree (CT ) testing polynomials are computed along paths using the elementary arithmetic operations.

Reference-contexts: The "topological" methods based on the number of connected components ([SY82], [B83]), or more general, on the sum of Betti numbers ([BLY92], <ref> [Y94] </ref>), provide the lower bound (n 2 ) for the Knapsack Problem and the lower bound (n log n) for the Element Distinctness Problem or the Permutation Problem. The already mentioned example from [BKL93] shows that these "topological" bounds cannot be directly extended to RCT s.
