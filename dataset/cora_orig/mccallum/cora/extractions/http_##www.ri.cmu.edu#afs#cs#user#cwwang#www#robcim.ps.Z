Reference-contexts: Bourne <ref> [2] </ref> developed an automatic bending process planner to generate plans with near-minimum manufacturing costs. This system consists of several sub-systems that work cooperatively to find the bending plan. The representation of a sheet metal part should provide sufficient information to make a complete production plan. <p> A small variation in the part geometry can result in 4 completely different bending sequences. Therefore, using the variant approach to generate the bending process plans may not work even though it has already been tried in the industry. Both de Vin [4] and Bourne <ref> [2] </ref> used the generative approach to search for the bending process plans. However, the former uses a backward reasoning approach (from final shape to at pattern) to search for feasible bending sequences while the latter uses a forward reasoning approach (from at pattern to final shape).

Reference-contexts: This has been used in various ways. For example, simulated manufacturing operations have been used to design a part, and then those operation names have been attached to the geometry, so the process planner can relate them to the actual processes [1,11]. Cutkosky et al. <ref> [3] </ref> have observed that the product development cycle can be reduced by awareness of manufacturing processes during the design process and that the features often carry these relationships. The process planning for bending sheet metal is considered difficult because the task is very sensitive to small changes in the geometry.

Reference-contexts: We have identified several important features for bending process. These features are later used to help prepare the process plans. Two approaches have been developed to identify features in a design: feature recognition [6] and design-with-features <ref> [5] </ref>. The feature recognition approach searches the geometric description of a part for known patterns and then labels the geometry subsets with a feature name. The design-with-features approach allows the designer to directly label the geometry. This has been used in various ways.

Reference-contexts: Our approach to deal with feature interaction problems, in sheet metal bending process, is twofold: first we observe and analyze the conicts among the sub-systems of our planning system to detect the interactions, then we resolve the interactions by assigning precedences among the conicting features. Gupta and Nau <ref> [7] </ref> used machining features to analyze the manufacturability of machined parts. The evaluation results could be used as design feedbacks to speed up new product development. We discuss several manufacturing problems for bent sheet parts which are related to some special features.

Reference-contexts: For example, features can interact in negative ways. One feature may suggest process-a; another feature, process-b. This conict raises questions of how these feature interactions can be detected and resolved. Hayes <ref> [8] </ref> used production rules to resolve negative interactions between features, and Nau et al. [12] used feature algebras to derive alternative interpretations of features to avoid them.

Reference-contexts: This geometry describes either the wire-frame or the boundary representation of a part. Unfolding software is then used to discover the topological relationships between the surfaces. With the unfolding result, the at pattern with the bend deductions can be calculated <ref> [13] </ref>. The disadvantages of current design approach are the lack of feature information and the correlation between at patterns and final part shapes can be ambiguous. When the design is complete, manufacturing engineers manually identify features most useful 6 for the process planning task.
