Reference-contexts: Other existing FPMCM projects are described in Chapter 3, while Chapter 4 details my own design work on FPMCMs. (ceramic flip-chip with custom chips) [Gar95], UC Santa Cruz (silicon flip chip and aluminum wirebonded with standard chips) [DGI + 94], and Hewlett Packard (ceramic wirebonded with custom chips) <ref> [ACC + 95] </ref> have developed field-programmable MCMs. Although each of these designs serves different objectives (emulation system, reconfigurable computing engine), these five MCM designs use different approaches which help to sketch the outlines of the design space. <p> making an assessment of the system architecture difficult. 3.5 HP's TERAMAC 3.5.1 Purpose A research group at HP Labs in Palo Alto has developed a reconfigurable computer called TERAMAC which is used to prototype and study parallel architectures which are developed as part of HP's internal product and research efforts <ref> [CAC + 96, ACC + 95, ACC + 96] </ref>. These designs require an emulation capability of millions of gates. The designers of TERAMAC observed that the compilation time for traditional field-programmable systems like the Quickturn Emulation systems were very long. <p> This architecture was used by Quickturn in a number of their emulation system products. The same type of architecture was later used by HP's Teramac <ref> [ACC + 95] </ref>. Each of these architectures share a set of logic nodes and a set of switches connected by a complete bipartite graph of some sort. We wish to define an architecture family that captures all of the variations above. <p> The particular architecture used will have a large impact on the nature of the steps in the compilation process. In general, the compilation can be made automatic if a very large amount of hardware is made available <ref> [ACC + 95] </ref>. Most FPLD manufacturers prefer to economize on hardware, and in the process create a number of NP-complete problems in the design flow. The presence of heuristic (and to some extent decidable) steps in the process creates the "fit-prediction problem" for FPLD architectures. <p> These statistics, though they seem staggering, are quite comparable to the existing Teramac module <ref> [ACC + 95] </ref>. is well within the limits of the wafer, verifying the assumption that routing density is the limiting factor 7.5.4 Scaling of Cost and Performance We now examine the scaling of architecture cost as a function of usable gates.

Reference-contexts: To figure the configuration time, I assume that each machine instruction can be implemented by 500-50,000 "gates" 5 worth of logic which must be downloaded to the machine. Typical FPLDs require about 20 bits of configuration data for each gate in the device <ref> [Alt93] </ref>, totaling 10k-1M bits per instruction. If these are delivered to the reconfigurable computer at 100MHz 10 bits at a time, the instruction download time, t d , is 10-1000 microseconds.

Reference-contexts: Of course, for scientific 5 To be concrete, I will assume that a minimum instruction is a 32-bit add, which can be implemented fully parallel in 32 4-LUTs. At 15-gates per LUT (approximate marketing numbers for Altera and Xilinx FPLDs <ref> [Alt95, Xil93b] </ref>), this is 480 gates. or more complicated instructions, such as 64-bit multiply might take closer to 50,000 gates to implement. <p> Once again, this scaling opportunity is limited by the fixed power consumed by the chips. The effective internal capacitance of a large chip like an Altera 10K50 FPLD is about 8nF, making conservative assumptions about duty-cycle <ref> [Alt95] </ref>. Even if each chip had 25pF loads on each of its 300 pads (almost a foot of wiring per pin), the total wiring capacitance would only be 7nF. Eliminating the wiring capacitance altogether can only cut the power in half. <p> The IO power is then roughly proportional to the clock frequency, F : I io ((64 (25 pF ) + 240 (5 pF))=2)V (F=4) (4.7) The internal power used by each chip is taken from the databook numbers. Altera provides the following guideline <ref> [Alt95] </ref>: 93 I internal F fl (LEs)(90 uA = M Hz)(dutycycle) (4.9) At 5 volts, this gives each LE an effective internal capacitance of 18pF! A full 2880-LE 10K50 then has an internal capacitance of 52nF. <p> Other than the IO limitations, the internal routing resources required is about the same in each case. 258 Quantity Estimate Description a aio (250m ) 2 Flip-chip bump pitch [Fli96] d pio 100m Standard wirebond pitch f pio 1.25 Power-signal ratio for wirebond FPLDs <ref> [Alt95] </ref> f aio 1.10 Power-signal ratio for flipchip FPLDs p 5 LE signal pins [Alt95] LE type 4-LUT + flip-flop from [Alt95] nominal "gates" per LE 15 based on [Alt95] a le (160) 2 LE fixed area (est. from Xilinx 3042 CLB area) a iocell (100m) 2 IO-cell area (from Xilinx <p> resources required is about the same in each case. 258 Quantity Estimate Description a aio (250m ) 2 Flip-chip bump pitch [Fli96] d pio 100m Standard wirebond pitch f pio 1.25 Power-signal ratio for wirebond FPLDs <ref> [Alt95] </ref> f aio 1.10 Power-signal ratio for flipchip FPLDs p 5 LE signal pins [Alt95] LE type 4-LUT + flip-flop from [Alt95] nominal "gates" per LE 15 based on [Alt95] a le (160) 2 LE fixed area (est. from Xilinx 3042 CLB area) a iocell (100m) 2 IO-cell area (from Xilinx 3042 die) ffi fpld 0.5 FPLD channel slack (to fit Xilinx 3042) a f <p> each case. 258 Quantity Estimate Description a aio (250m ) 2 Flip-chip bump pitch [Fli96] d pio 100m Standard wirebond pitch f pio 1.25 Power-signal ratio for wirebond FPLDs <ref> [Alt95] </ref> f aio 1.10 Power-signal ratio for flipchip FPLDs p 5 LE signal pins [Alt95] LE type 4-LUT + flip-flop from [Alt95] nominal "gates" per LE 15 based on [Alt95] a le (160) 2 LE fixed area (est. from Xilinx 3042 CLB area) a iocell (100m) 2 IO-cell area (from Xilinx 3042 die) ffi fpld 0.5 FPLD channel slack (to fit Xilinx 3042) a f pldctl 1 fi 10 7 2 Constant <p> (250m ) 2 Flip-chip bump pitch [Fli96] d pio 100m Standard wirebond pitch f pio 1.25 Power-signal ratio for wirebond FPLDs <ref> [Alt95] </ref> f aio 1.10 Power-signal ratio for flipchip FPLDs p 5 LE signal pins [Alt95] LE type 4-LUT + flip-flop from [Alt95] nominal "gates" per LE 15 based on [Alt95] a le (160) 2 LE fixed area (est. from Xilinx 3042 CLB area) a iocell (100m) 2 IO-cell area (from Xilinx 3042 die) ffi fpld 0.5 FPLD channel slack (to fit Xilinx 3042) a f pldctl 1 fi 10 7 2 Constant FPLD control area (same as FPIC) Table 6.3:

A detailed treatment of each of these candidate architectures is far beyond the scope of this work.

Reference-contexts: IO and logic elements are usually physically separate, and routing channels connect the two. 17 sole exception is logical inversion, a function that we can often consider to built into the interconnect network. Some FPLDs have no logic elements at all and are simply field programmable interconnects (FPICs) <ref> [Apt92] </ref>. Storage provides the ability to implement sequential circuits in the FPLD. Although it is often provided with logic elements to form a larger logic block, this need not be the case. <p> The overall interconnect architecture for the FPMCM-I is a hybrid between the star and tree architectures and includes direct interconnect in addition to switched interconnect on the substrate. Final Architecture The final FPMCM-I architecture consists of 12 X3042s encircling an Aptix FPIC-D <ref> [Apt92] </ref>. Four surface mount chip capacitors provide power decoupling on the substrate (Figure 4.2). Each 76 FPIC to the FPGA, and 12 direction connections between each FPGA. 22 pins on each FPGA connect to both the central switch, and to external bondpads. <p> Programmable interconnect chips implement arbitrary connections between pins and come in several varieties. The Aptix FPIC 232 uses an array of IO pads connected by a set of interconnect row and columns using a segmented channel routing architecture <ref> [Apt92] </ref>. Other crossbar chips are available to implement byte-wide connections for a number of channels. Multistage networks can also be used to create switching networks [Joe79, MGN79, Clo53, HJ86, SR90]. The basic function of a field-programmable interconnect device is to make interconnections between a set of N IO pins. <p> To consider the significance of this bound on a real design, consider the 1024 pin FPIC device 242 an array of tiles, each with a fixed area for IO circuitry, horizontal and vertical channels, and a switchbox. <ref> [Apt92] </ref>, which has very good routability. For this device p N = 32, and w = 18, 2 which implies that 1.25 is an approximate appropriate value of ffi fpic . This is the value that I will use in area estimation for FPICs. <p> p i fpic =4 (6.79) a fpic core = i fpic a fpiccell (w fpic ) + a fpicctl (6.80) 246 Quantity Estimate Description a f c (250m ) 2 Flip-chip bump pitch [Fli96] d wb 100m Standard wirebond pitch [Har91b] ffi fpic 1.25 FPIC channel slack (from Aptix architecture <ref> [Apt92] </ref>) a f picctl 1 fi 10 7 2 FPIC fixed control area (est. from Aptix FPIC) a bit 400 2 CMOS bit area [RFLC90] a f picfixed (100m) 2 Fixed FPIC cell area [Apt92] Table 6.2: Assumed values for the FPIC area model. <p> d wb 100m Standard wirebond pitch [Har91b] ffi fpic 1.25 FPIC channel slack (from Aptix architecture <ref> [Apt92] </ref>) a f picctl 1 fi 10 7 2 FPIC fixed control area (est. from Aptix FPIC) a bit 400 2 CMOS bit area [RFLC90] a f picfixed (100m) 2 Fixed FPIC cell area [Apt92] Table 6.2: Assumed values for the FPIC area model. Summary of FPIC Area Model In this section I have developed a rough model for the area of an FPIC given its number of inputs and outputs and a set of technology parameters. <p> FPIC Area Model The FPIC area model basically is a fit to O (N 2 ) lower bound for all crossbars. Data from the fit were obtained by examining a real FPIC device <ref> [Apt92] </ref>, and there is good agreement between the model predictions and the characteristics of this part. FPLD Area Model The FPLD area model is basically a fit to a O (G 2r ) bisection-based lower bound for FPLDs.

Reference-contexts: Custom Supercomputing allows the logic elements in the FPS to be mapped to a specific algorithms, such as a neural networks systolic arrays, signal processing or many other applications (e.g., <ref> [CB91, BRV92, ID94, SB94, Hoa93, Arn93] </ref>). In many cases, the user designs a circuit tailored to their computing task and then downloads it to the FPS for execution. <p> For examples, the input to some reconfigurable systems is a VHDL description of a circuit to be implemented <ref> [Arn93] </ref>, while other systems have developed special dataflow languages [ID95], or modified existing general purpose languages such as C. Despite the nature of the high-level input, these descriptions are invariably mapped to a circuit-level description at some point as an entry point into FPLD vendors' mapping software (Figure 5.24).

Reference-contexts: Multi-chip modules provide a solution to this problem by packaging several chips together on a small, dense substrate, which provides an intermediate level of wiring between the IC level and the board level <ref> [Bak90] </ref>. 2.4.1 Overview of MCM The principle idea of multi-chip module (MCM) technology is to integrate several unpackaged or bare die onto a chip carrier to provide a higher level of integration density. <p> Since that time IBM has developed the technology very aggressively to use MCM components like the Thermal Conduction Module (TCM) for its mainframe computer systems. Much of the data that follows is Bakoglu's description of this technology <ref> [Bak90] </ref>. MCM-C can accommodate very large module sizes (&gt; 9cm fi 9cm) and extreme numbers of layers (&gt; 33). However the routing pitch is only slightly better than printed circuit boards (150m ), probably because most ceramics employ screen printing rather than photolithography. <p> Intrinsic RC-delay of the line itself remains constant, however, if the on chip buffers and capacitive loads remain the same, the total RC delay becomes <ref> [Bak90] </ref>: t RC = 0:7 (R tr (C L + C int ) + R int C L ) + 0:4R int C int (2.10) which will tend to increase for very small wires because of the increasing wire resistance. <p> One of the earliest works is the SUSPENS system presented in <ref> [Bak90] </ref>, which was used to explore the impact of packaging and device technology on the performance of CPUs. [SM94] presents a system for conceptual design of multichip modules that estimates device performance, cost and reliability for a particular design over a number of packaging technologies. [Geb92] presents a system for high-level <p> There are many reasons why circuit complexity is a super-linear function of gates even in the transistor world. First, as processes scale to smaller and smaller dimensions, the resistive component of the wire delay begins to dominate the total switching delay of the circuits <ref> [Bak90] </ref>. Larger circuits require longer wires which exacerbate performance and timing problems. Second, designers have noticed that even IC process architectures are often routing limited and not limited by the raw transistor counts, forcing processes with ever greater number of routing layers. <p> Many yield models have been used to predict yield based on die area. The simple Poisson model does not usually work because defects on wafers tend to cluster near each other. I will use the Murphy yield model, because it relieves us from estimating the clustering parameters <ref> [Bak90, Sta86, Cic95] </ref>. Y patt = da (6.17) based on a fixed pre-yield cost. 225 will predict different yields as a function of die size. <p> The mean interconnect distance inside the core (l logwb ) is a function of placement algorithms and is estimated by the relationship in <ref> [Bak90] </ref>. I count the number of these internal nets as the total number of logic pins less those pins connected to IO nets divided by 2 (all nets are assumed two-point). <p> This yield is more of a factor in processes with thin dielectric layers that span the substrate (nChip), rather than processes with thick dielectrics (MMS). Nevertheless, we include it in our model. I assume a certain defect density (f pinhole , and apply the Poisson yield model <ref> [Bak90] </ref> to the total effective area: Y subgross = e N lay A subst f pinhole (6.143) This should also be a small effect for a mature process.

Reference-contexts: FPLD's low setup and engineering costs and near-instant turnaround have made them a popular technology for low and medium volume ASIC designs (below 100,000 ASIC gates). The price of FPLDs has decreased steadily since their introduction to about 0.5-1.0 cents per gate <ref> [Bak94] </ref>. 2 1 Throughout this dissertation, I will prefer the term Field programmable logic device to the more familiar Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) because the former implies a function, while the latter suggests an implementation. I will use FPLD as a general term encompassing EPLDs, CPLDs, etc.

Reference-contexts: It is important to realize that although these non-blocking networks require a smaller number of switches (fi (N lg N ) or sometimes fi (N 1:5 )) than the crossbar <ref> [BH95] </ref>, the 236 asymptotic layout area is once again driven by the large number of wires crossing sideways in the routing channels. As a result, the asymptotic routing area for these architectures is also fi (N 2 ).

Reference-contexts: Bipartite-connection Architecture A common FPS architecture which avoids the scalability bottleneck is the Clos switching architecture. The basic idea is to decompose the central switch in the tree into a number of smaller switches. The standard Clos network is a re-arrangeable three stage network of crossbars <ref> [CS93, VBB93, Clo53] </ref> (Figure 5.9). The original Clos network had a stage of r n fi m crossbars, a second stage of m, r fi r crossbars, and a third stage like the first. <p> Other crossbar chips are available to implement byte-wide connections for a number of channels. Multistage networks can also be used to create switching networks <ref> [Joe79, MGN79, Clo53, HJ86, SR90] </ref>. The basic function of a field-programmable interconnect device is to make interconnections between a set of N IO pins.

Reference-contexts: Because of the fast turn time required, and the prototype nature of the project, I could only run the project through MIDAS, the DARPA-sponsored MCM fabrication service <ref> [Cos94] </ref>. MIDAS provided access to three MCM processes: the MCM-D processes at Micromodule Systems and nChip, and the MCM-C process at IBM. Because of the high interconnection demands of the clique architecture, and our experience with MCM-D, I decided not to pursue the MCM-C option.

Reference-contexts: For example, the gate counts for the Altera 10K series FPLDs are roughly evenly split between flip-flops, RAM, and LUTs [Ver96]. 1 Furthermore, researchers have proposed a number of architectural complications including memory cells inside the FPLDs [Alt96], fixed interconnections to make larger logic blocks <ref> [CR92] </ref>, and combining LUT and PLA architectures [KB96]. A detailed treatment of each of these candidate architectures is far beyond the scope of this work. For our purposes, I will assume that all the logic elements of FPLD are of the same type.

The basic idea is to decompose the central switch in the tree into a number of smaller switches. The standard Clos network is a re-arrangeable three stage network of crossbars <ref> [CS93, VBB93, Clo53] </ref> (Figure 5.9).

Simple necessary and sufficient conditions for routability of arbitrary hypernets are not known. The Clos network itself does not define an architecture family because we have not identified any logic nodes. <p> As a degenerate case, we could have a single central switch in which case the outer switches would be 1 fi 1 (wires). On the other end of the spectrum, we could have the outer switches be full crossbars, and have the central switch consist of wires. <ref> [CS93] </ref> presents a refinement of the Clos architecture which resolves the problem that the original Clos network had defined inputs and outputs and applies the network directly to FPLDs.

Reference-contexts: Past literature has reported Rent exponents in or around the neighborhood of 0.65-0.75, depending on the parallelism or complexity of the logic <ref> [CSZ93] </ref> [LR71]. This large exponent does not apply to specially designed circuits such as systolic arrays that effectively serialize the communication but has been observed consistently in control and other random logic. Readers may wonder why Rent's rule poses a problem for multi-chip emulation systems but not for single FPLDs. <p> Although it may be very difficult to tell whether a circuit will fit in a given architecture, comparing architectures (i.e.areas) is trivial. It would be useful if a simple measure like area existed for FPLDs. However, past attempt to characterize fittability on the CLB utilization alone have failed <ref> [CSZ93] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we have the parameter representing the projection of a pad into the routing plane, d pad (Figure 6.20). The density will partially be a function of the wiring style, which I will assume to be an 266 Manhattan wiring for now. All-angle wiring, as used in the FPMCM-2 <ref> [Dai91] </ref> introduces some interesting possibilities, but also creates the problem of controlling crosstalk. Since all-angle routers have a difficult time preventing parallel wires in adjacent layers, I will require f lay = 1:5, forcing one reference plane per signal plane. This should provide adequate shielding to prevent inter-layer crosstalk. <p> circuit generator RPM Revolutions Per Minute SIA Semiconductor Industry Association SIS the sucessor to MIS SMT Surface Mount, a PCB assembly technique SRAM Static Random-Access Memory SSO Simultaneous-Switching Output (noise) STAR The star family of FPMCM architectures SR Stochastic Routability SURF A gridless routing system for MCMs designed at UCSC <ref> [Dai91] </ref> SUSPENS A system for estimating size and performance for computer systems [Bak90] SUSPENSE An extension to SUSPENS for AI-specific machines [Rob95] TAB Tape-Automated Bonding TCM Thermal Conduction Module TREE The Tree family of FPMCM architectures TUM Totally Unimodular, a property of some matrices UCSC University of California, Santa Cruz ULM

Reference-contexts: For area-array chips, the pad pitch will almost certainly be several wire pitches more than the pad size, so we do not need to worry about staggering pads.

Reference-contexts: There is a lack of good, simple models to predict flip-chip yields. Despite this, we can make some decent assumptions. First, the flip-chip process is self aligning and the flip-chip pads are fixed with respect to each other <ref> [DDNS92] </ref>. As a result the yield of nearby pads is correlated, so we can use a per-chip defect model rather than a per- pad defect model.

Reference-contexts: We choose AT&T's silicon-on-silicon process because of its high wiring density, flip-chip capability, and high performance. AT&T prefers a low cost flip-chip process (-SMT) which allows them to compete with conventional packaging <ref> [DDS + 94] </ref>. Because the -SMT process required bump pitches of 400 microns or higher and most FPLDs had pad pitches as small as 125 microns, we needed to place an additional layer of rerouting on the FPLD die to redistribute the IOs.

Reference-contexts: Architectures like the Dynamically Programmable Gate Array (DPGA) use multiple on-chip configurations (called contexts) to control a single piece of physical hardware, allowing a single physical logic element to act like multiple "virtual" logic elements <ref> [DeH94] </ref>. In addition, some authors have proposed routing schemes where physical interconnect resources are time-multiplexed to create several virtual signal channels, which can increase the area or IO efficiency of an architecture [BTA93, LC95, DeH96b].

One way to improve this ratio even further is to have faster download times which can be achieved by downloading during operation of another context <ref> [DeH94] </ref>, or by changing the architecture to coarse-grained functions to improve the ratio of bits per instruction [MD96].

Reference-contexts: A key property of 45 a good substrate material is its flatness, since the depth of field of the optics is severely limited. Some designs take advantage of the silicon substrate to embed transistors which add to the functionality of the module [FTLL92]. Dielectrics range from oxides <ref> [Dem94] </ref> for high thermal conductivity, to polyimides which are more mechanically compliant. Because these materials can be processed with photo-definable masks, very high line densities are achievable. Current MCM-D technologies have a limit of about 35m pitch on two to five routing layers.

Reference-contexts: Other existing FPMCM projects are described in Chapter 3, while Chapter 4 details my own design work on FPMCMs. (ceramic flip-chip with custom chips) [Gar95], UC Santa Cruz (silicon flip chip and aluminum wirebonded with standard chips) <ref> [DGI + 94] </ref>, and Hewlett Packard (ceramic wirebonded with custom chips) [ACC + 95] have developed field-programmable MCMs. Although each of these designs serves different objectives (emulation system, reconfigurable computing engine), these five MCM designs use different approaches which help to sketch the outlines of the design space. <p> Buses of different lengths extend down each channel and wrap around the module as needed. 3.1.3 Packaging Technology The only packaging technology mentioned in the papers is the AT&T silicon-on-silicon technology which was later used in the UCSC FPMCM-I <ref> [DGI + 94] </ref>.

The architecture was primarily my contribution, though others contributed work toward its realization. 4.1.1 Architecture Design The FPMCM-I was the prototype in a series of silicon-on-silicon FPMCMs. <p> We decided to use the Aptix FPIC-D because it was designed for flip-chip. Before selecting a particular FPGA, I used cost data (Table 4.1) simple Rent's rule-based capacity models to compute the effective gates of several architectures. (Details in <ref> [DGI + 94] </ref>). The Xilinx 3042 was chosen as building block because of the balance between chip cost, substrate complexity, and on-chip routability. Although the larger devices do have a larger effective capacity in this architecture, the cost required to achieve it is significantly larger.

Reference-contexts: If a heat sink can be attached directly to the MCM, then MCM-D can have better thermal performance. Chips-first technologies have this advantage, provided that the interconnect yield can be made high enough to offset the risk of scrapping the die (Figure 2.17) <ref> [GHKF93, ED93] </ref>. If a second-level package is necessary, however, it will certainly increase the thermal resistance of the MCM.

Reference-contexts: Since this package is often a ceramic pin-grid array (PGA) or quad-flat-pack (QFP) because of power dissipation, MCM-D can sometimes seem more complicated than MCM-C. Using low-cost plastic BGAs, tape-automated bonding (TAB), or chip-on-board (COB) technology to eliminate this second-level of packaging is another attractive approach <ref> [Fry93] </ref>. 46 to a substrate and then interconnect is patterned on top. IO pads can be placed on the top level interconnect and a heatsink in proximity to the backside of the die, solving many of the problems of silicon-on-silicon. <p> As a result the overall power scales as P + p 1=E, where P is a constant representing the on-chip power. This power savings can increase when the drivers are specifically designed for the MCM interconnects <ref> [Fry93] </ref>. Still, total power remains roughly constant unless the chips are also scaled.

Reference-contexts: After this step, die must be burned in. Bare die burn in is a controversial issue for MCM manufacture. Many low-value MCMs using mature parts do not use burn-in because it is not a significant factor in overall module yield or cost <ref> [Fry94] </ref>. FPMCMs use many large die which are relatively new and have not gone through many redesign cycles. As a result, the burn-in 228 fallout can be as high as 20%.

Reference-contexts: I assume an 8" wafer in a 0.5m technology, which is readily available today. I estimate the wafer cost and defect density <ref> [FSTB95] </ref>. The wafer probe cost is set on the assumption that the first-level test cost is about 5% of the raw silicon cost. The test effectiveness of this step is low because the wafer probe is usually a functional test only and so misses a whole class of defects [MB88].

Reference-contexts: Since it seems probable that CMOS will continue to advance for at least another decade <ref> [FTLG93] </ref>, one obvious approach is to increase the number of logic blocks that are placed on a single-chip. <p> It is interesting to consider that the cost of an interconnect technology seems to be roughly constant when considered in terms of the total number of "layout squares" bought <ref> [FTLG93] </ref>. This may be more the result of the demand for functionality of interconnect rather than the cost to produce it.

Reference-contexts: Metal interconnects can be placed at a 35m pitch, about eight times as dense as circuit board traces and ten times less dense than IC traces. If desired, additional process steps can be added to fabricate resistors, capacitors <ref> [FTLL92] </ref>, and bipolar transistors [DHT + 94] directly on the substrate. Conventional ICs, sometimes post-processed to meet flip-chip assembly requirements, are bumped, diced, and tested. They are then attached face-down on the the substrate with solder bumps in a manner similar to surface mount on a printed circuit board. <p> A key property of 45 a good substrate material is its flatness, since the depth of field of the optics is severely limited. Some designs take advantage of the silicon substrate to embed transistors which add to the functionality of the module <ref> [FTLL92] </ref>. Dielectrics range from oxides [Dem94] for high thermal conductivity, to polyimides which are more mechanically compliant. Because these materials can be processed with photo-definable masks, very high line densities are achievable. Current MCM-D technologies have a limit of about 35m pitch on two to five routing layers. <p> Although each FPLD has control pins routed to the FPMCM for testing purposes, this has not been useful and makes the board design cumbersome because a large number of pullups are required. Future FPMCMs should take advantage of the ability to place resistors in the MCM substrate <ref> [FTLL92] </ref>. Our group has developed an application development system that allows the FPMCM to be used as a high performance co-processor to a Sun workstation.The system provides very efficient implementation of datapath circuits from a C-like description of the hardware, which is used for both simulation and logic synthesis [ID94]. <p> The substrate design introduced some testability challenges at the substrate and module level. A flying two-probe tester was used to test the substrate after wafer bumping <ref> [FTLL92] </ref>. The two probe can perform resistance and capacitance measurements between any two nets on the substrate. Since measurement takes about 1/10th of second and each bump can survive a limited number of probes, I needed to minimize the number of measurements.

Reference-contexts: Fortunately, the FPMCM-2 was designed to meet the need for densely connected bit-serial circuits, which do not have such a high Rent exponent <ref> [Iss96] </ref>. <p> For a Rent exponent of 0.65, the usable LEs per FPLD is only 79 of the available 2880. Full utilization of the device only becomes possible when the Rent exponent drops below .36, as is seen in bit-serial circuits <ref> [Iss96] </ref>. Of course, this analysis is somewhat pessimistic, because we have neglected any benefit that might be had from partitioning into only a few devices. 7.5.2 Substrate Complexity Model Like BIPARTITE, CLIQUE architectures are very hard to lay out. <p> chip technology improves without corresponding improvements in packaging and interconnect technologies, that modules will benefit, but chips will gradually close the cost-performance gap. 7.8.2 Applications with a lower Rent exponent Some authors have noted that there are special classes of applications for FPMCMs which have lower than average Rent Exponents <ref> [Iss96] </ref>. Of all the parameters in this cost-performance study, the Rent exponent has the highest impact. This was carefully considered when choosing 339 process.

A detailed treatment of each of these candidate architectures is far beyond the scope of this work. For our purposes, I will assume that all the logic elements of FPLD are of the same type. Other logic elements and special architectural "frills" (and limitations) will be ignored for now.

Reference-contexts: The first large-scale "computers" in history are not the electronic machines we normally think of, but instead were primitive electro-mechanical card tabulating machines. Technology developed by Hollerith for tabulating the 1890 census became the mainstream business of a company known as IBM in 1914 <ref> [KC94] </ref>. IBM provided its customers with a number of machines that would process stacks of cards. Many machines were required because each machine had only a limited range of functions: some machines duplicated cards, other were used for sorting, other were used to tabulate sums of cards matching certain records. <p> No single process may be able to simultaneously achieve all of the most aggressive values. a very old technology, and ceramic MCMs were used in the fabrication of the very first IC-based computers for the Apollo spacecraft in the late 1960s <ref> [KC94] </ref>. In those days, ICs had only a few transistors each, compared with millions today. Later MCMs or ceramic hybrids were standard packaging for a number of military avionics systems.

Reference-contexts: Testing the interconnect resources is a more complicated matter, though there is some work that shows that the number of tests test is still O (N N ) <ref> [LACH96] </ref>. For FPLDs, the test cost may be dominated by the configuration time, which will be O (N ) or O (N p N ).

Reference-contexts: In addition, some authors have proposed routing schemes where physical interconnect resources are time-multiplexed to create several virtual signal channels, which can increase the area or IO efficiency of an architecture <ref> [BTA93, LC95, DeH96b] </ref>. A further complication is added by considering architectures that allow run-time reconfiguration of the device. The basic idea is to use the reconfigurable hardware to perform a number of different functions by downloading a number of different bitstreams [WH95, VCCZ96].

Reference-contexts: Past literature has reported Rent exponents in or around the neighborhood of 0.65-0.75, depending on the parallelism or complexity of the logic [CSZ93] <ref> [LR71] </ref>. This large exponent does not apply to specially designed circuits such as systolic arrays that effectively serialize the communication but has been observed consistently in control and other random logic. Readers may wonder why Rent's rule poses a problem for multi-chip emulation systems but not for single FPLDs. <p> We can use Rent's rule to express this growth: p sys N r p chip (4.1) where p chip is the pins per FPLD of the N FPLDs and r is the Rent exponent, usually taken to be between 0.5 and 0.75 <ref> [LR71] </ref>. 81 MCM technology depends on the pins per chip, p chip , and the area of each board pin, d board , the number of pins on the system interface, p sys , and the MCM bump pitch, d mcm . <p> Before going further, let us review the basis behind the Rent's rule phenomenon. 170 Rent's rule is described in an early paper by Landman and Russo <ref> [LR71] </ref>. Their empirical studies focused on the relationship between the average number of blocks per partition (g) and the average number of pins per partition (p) using a partitioning system they developed. <p> Quantity Symbol Observed values Pins per cell k 3.24-20.12 Rent exponent r 0.56-0.75 Burying coefficient k b 0.36-2.28 Burying exponent r b 1.11-1.23 Sharing coefficient k s 1.28-8.25 Sharing exponent r s 1.05-1.10 Table 5.2: Some experimentally observed values for the Rent parameters for equations (5.61) and (5.62) reported in <ref> [LR71] </ref>. with field-programmable systems today is no different. The situation is analogous to bin packing where some bins are never quite full because of the granularity of the blocks. As a result, partitioning is almost always accompanied by a drop in gate utilization.

Reference-contexts: Three papers describe the electrical, architectural and CAD tools needed to implement their architecture, the architecture was never implemented <ref> [DGHK92b, DGHK92a, LZG94] </ref>. The purpose of the device was simply to have a larger FPLD. 3.1.2 Architecture The FRAME architecture is actually a class of architectures with similar topology. Figure 3.1 shows the basic plan of the FRAME architecture. <p> Frequency of Hypernets Another significant property of a partitioner is its tendency to generate hypernets. To a large extent, this will be controlled by the cost function used for chip-to-chip routing. Some authors report that multichip partitions have few nets with degree more than 2 <ref> [LZG94] </ref>. To confirm this, I collected net degree statistics from the data set used above (where the number of clusters was large). The net degree distribution is shown in Figure 5.44. The degree distribution is monotonically decreasing. In this case, the mean was about 2.9. <p> Using diagonal and long-distance interconnects offer some improvements [HBE94], but I will not consider these here.

Reference-contexts: test is the test effectiveness, (E test ). (Note that the test effectiveness is not directly related to the test transparency because the effectiveness of a test will depend not only on the fraction of defects that are detected, but on the distribution of defects that actually occur in practice <ref> [MB88] </ref>.) Each test operation also has an intrinsic cost (C test ), which further raises the cost to test. <p> The wafer probe cost is set on the assumption that the first-level test cost is about 5% of the raw silicon cost. The test effectiveness of this step is low because the wafer probe is usually a functional test only and so misses a whole class of defects <ref> [MB88] </ref>. Die handling and burn in costs are low to reflect the market requirement for such costs to be competitive with plastic packaging. The loss of dice during sawing is not considered significant, though the burn in loss is about 10%, which is appropriate for large new ICs. <p> The loss of dice during sawing is not considered significant, though the burn in loss is about 10%, which is appropriate for large new ICs. Test effectiveness of the final functional test and AC parametrics is also extrapolated from the experimental data in <ref> [MB88] </ref> with some padding for more advance test-pattern generation, and its cost is estimated to be higher because of the detailed nature of the final test.

Reference-contexts: I consider the cost of this step to be negligible for the same reasons we were able to ignore it for the ICs. A flying probe capacitance tester can be used to detect pattern defects <ref> [MCMW94] </ref>. New technologies are being developed that will allow batch probing of interconnects, but for 270 now, the interconnect test consists of a series of electrical measurements on a tester.

Reference-contexts: One way to improve this ratio even further is to have faster download times which can be achieved by downloading during operation of another context [DeH94], or by changing the architecture to coarse-grained functions to improve the ratio of bits per instruction <ref> [MD96] </ref>. Unfortunately, very large loop size problems are in the domain of supercomputing, which is not quite general purpose. For simple straight-line code, the RCC can still have an advantage, if it is embedded a routine that is called fairly often and can be cached on the RCC.

Reference-contexts: Since MCM-D processes use old or obsolete IC fabrication equipment for substrate fab, the substrate materials are often similar to ICs. Base materials can be silicon, glass, ceramic, or diamond though polished aluminum is sometimes used to reduce cost <ref> [Mic96] </ref>. A key property of 45 a good substrate material is its flatness, since the depth of field of the optics is severely limited. Some designs take advantage of the silicon substrate to embed transistors which add to the functionality of the module [FTLL92]. <p> Although polyimides are much more thermally resistive than ceramics, the thicknesses involved are often quite different. A typical process like MMS uses 32m of polyimide between the die attach and the aluminum substrate which is a few millimeters thick <ref> [Mic96] </ref>. This is the thermal equivalent of 2.5mm of ceramic|which is less than most ceramic MCMs because of the large number of wiring layers required. If a heat sink can be attached directly to the MCM, then MCM-D can have better thermal performance. <p> Substrate model The substrate model is based on simple methods which can be used to approximate the physical design quantities, as well as traditional modeling techniques [SM94], and conversations with experts from MCM foundries <ref> [Wes96, Mic96] </ref>. Because the cost model is so complicated, we verify it by applying it to the two FPMCM designs we have done so far, FPMCM-I and FPMCM-II.

Because the reconfigurable computing field is still quite young, benchmarking for RCC may need to wait for standard architectures, compiler interfaces, and computational workloads to develop <ref> [MS96] </ref>. There is, however, a community of users for which FPLD characterization is at least somewhat mature: ASIC emulation.

The Need for Field-Programmable Multi-chip Modules If Field-Programmable Multi-chip Modules (FPMCMs) are bigger, better FPLDs, then the technological importance of FPMCMs is derived from the technological importance of FPLDs. In this chapter I review the historical development of FPLDs and their current place in the computing industry. <p> This was a challenging issue at the time because there was no memory technology readily available. The IAS and EDVAC machines both pioneered this concept in the mid 40s, employing either CRT or mercury acoustic delay lines for memory. In 1947, at von Neumann's urging <ref> [Ran73] </ref>, ENIAC was even hacked into a serial stored-program machine in a rather interesting way: a particular configuration of the machine that would allow codes to address particular function units configured for different logical operations.

In many cases, the user designs a circuit tailored to their computing task and then downloads it to the FPS for execution.

Of course, the scaling does not translate into simple 4x performance increase. The size of the IO cells will be about the same because of pad geometry and ESD requirements.

Reference-contexts: This "backtracking" process is very time consuming when undertaken by human engineers and does not produce a systematic search of the available possibilities. In the past, MCMs designs have suffered from a so-called moving target problem <ref> [Siu92] </ref>. The problem arises because CMOS density is increasing so rapidly that by the time an MCM designer completes a design with an existing chipset, the next generation of the same chipset is in production as a single die, obliterating the need for the MCM.

Reference-contexts: The key metrics of the quality of a tech mapping solution is the number of LEs used to implement a circuit and the pre-routing delay estimates. Some work has been done to estimate these quantities based on the characteristics of the minimized input equations <ref> [SKC94] </ref>. Because it is difficult to specify metrics which can be used to measure the input, I will not spend time trying to develop a predictive relationship for the technology mapping step. <p> Finally, a few groups have observed that the result of the technology-mapping step can have a great impact on routability, and have developed tech mappers that do not pack gates so aggressively to minimize the local routing congestion <ref> [SKC94] </ref>. Although we can see that the boundary between logic and interconnections is not altogether sharp, I will ignore the fine points for now, and proceed to consider the parts of the design flow that deal with interconnections.

Reference-contexts: Many yield models have been used to predict yield based on die area. The simple Poisson model does not usually work because defects on wafers tend to cluster near each other. I will use the Murphy yield model, because it relieves us from estimating the clustering parameters <ref> [Bak90, Sta86, Cic95] </ref>. Y patt = da (6.17) based on a fixed pre-yield cost. 225 will predict different yields as a function of die size. <p> Both of these approaches will have an adverse affect on module yield, though the implications of scaling the design rules are harder to predict because they require knowledge of the shape of the defect distributions <ref> [Sta86] </ref>. For large modules, the smaller design rules are more problematic because they increase the series loss of the resistive lines. I will make the assumption that the design rules for the layer interconnects are actually the best that the technology can accommodate. <p> These are defects that result in opens and shorts in the interconnect. Because many MCM layers can be sparse, the concept of critical area is useful in estimating the dependence on this with design <ref> [Sta86] </ref>. Tools exist which can compute the critical area of a given design, but we can obviously not use these before we have constructed a layout.

Reference-contexts: Most MCMs are limited to a certain fraction of a wafer in area. Placing 8 large chips on a substrate is a simple impracticality because of the area they would take up. Chip stacks may provide a solution <ref> [TBBD94] </ref>. By placing chips on top of each other so they share a common footprint, the overall logic density is improved. In addition, the chip stack places chip pads in close proximity to one another, lowering the mean wirelength (Figure 7.36).

It is true that just about the only theoretical lower bounds for circuit complexity rely on the number of interconnections between halves of a logic circuit <ref> [Ull84] </ref>. This fact could be as much a statement of limitations in our ability to construct proofs as anything else. We can approach the question by considering the number of bits that are needed to encode the logic part and the interconnection part of a circuit.

Reference-contexts: In addition, instead of the single very large FPIC, it is possible to break up the FPIC into several smaller FPICs, greatly reducing the escape density required under each and making the floor-planning much simpler <ref> [VBB93] </ref>. These measures could reduce the wiring density by a factor of two. Module Packaging Packaging the FPMCM was difficult because of the non-standard size of the substrate and the high cost of developing an entirely new package. <p> Bipartite-connection Architecture A common FPS architecture which avoids the scalability bottleneck is the Clos switching architecture. The basic idea is to decompose the central switch in the tree into a number of smaller switches. The standard Clos network is a re-arrangeable three stage network of crossbars <ref> [CS93, VBB93, Clo53] </ref> (Figure 5.9). The original Clos network had a stage of r n fi m crossbars, a second stage of m, r fi r crossbars, and a third stage like the first. <p> We can then refer to elements of the FOLDEDCLOS architecture family by F OLDEDCLOS (f; g; s; b; i). <ref> [VBB93] </ref> presents a similar architecture (the Butt's architecture), but instead of each chip-to-chip path consisting of a single-wire, they allow for multiple-wire buses between each set of chips.

Reference-contexts: A further complication is added by considering architectures that allow run-time reconfiguration of the device. The basic idea is to use the reconfigurable hardware to perform a number of different functions by downloading a number of different bitstreams <ref> [WH95, VCCZ96] </ref>. Though this can resemble dynamic configuration in a loose sense, it is usually a simple case of reconfigur-ing entire devices.

Reference-contexts: The real technology-mapping problem is much more difficult that we have so far suggested. Vendor's reported logic gates are divided into gates in LUTs, flip-flops, and memory cells. For example, the gate counts for the Altera 10K series FPLDs are roughly evenly split between flip-flops, RAM, and LUTs <ref> [Ver96] </ref>. 1 Furthermore, researchers have proposed a number of architectural complications including memory cells inside the FPLDs [Alt96], fixed interconnections to make larger logic blocks [CR92], and combining LUT and PLA architectures [KB96]. A detailed treatment of each of these candidate architectures is far beyond the scope of this work.

Although some partitioners exist which consider the routing and partitioning problem at the same time <ref> [Vij90] </ref>, these tools are relatively rare. It is useful to study the types of connection patterns produced by a partitioner to see if there is any structure that can be exploited by an FPMCM architecture.

Reference-contexts: Of course, the clustering produced by rmc is only one of many possible clusterings. We need to consider the possibility that a better partitioning could be found. To examine the real Rent parameters of the circuits, I used the ratio-cut partitioner <ref> [WC91b] </ref> to decompose the circuit into clusters. The clustering produced by ratio-cut is shown in Figure 5.20. given to rmc. Observe that value of the measured Rent parameter varies by 0.1 on either side of the target value. <p> Clearly this will be very dependent on the partitioning algorithm used. For example, some partitioners could try to control the variation of pins between clusters, or other sophisticated techniques to produce more predictable clusters. To be conservative, I will employ the ratio cut partitioner of Wei and Cheng <ref> [WC91b] </ref>. This partitioner has an objective function which, it is claimed, tends to extract the "natural clusters" from the circuit when used in k-way partitioning. In addition, it makes no special efforts to control the variation of pins on a cluster.

Reference-contexts: Substrate model The substrate model is based on simple methods which can be used to approximate the physical design quantities, as well as traditional modeling techniques [SM94], and conversations with experts from MCM foundries <ref> [Wes96, Mic96] </ref>. Because the cost model is so complicated, we verify it by applying it to the two FPMCM designs we have done so far, FPMCM-I and FPMCM-II.

Reference-contexts: A further complication is added by considering architectures that allow run-time reconfiguration of the device. The basic idea is to use the reconfigurable hardware to perform a number of different functions by downloading a number of different bitstreams <ref> [WH95, VCCZ96] </ref>. Though this can resemble dynamic configuration in a loose sense, it is usually a simple case of reconfigur-ing entire devices. <p> The routine is called once when it is needed and then stored so that reconfiguration is not necessary the next time it is called. This is the principal innovation of the Dynamic Instruction Set Computer (DISC) <ref> [WH95] </ref>. In this scheme, more reconfigurable hardware buys increased speed because 34 there is less of a need to pay the cost of reconfiguration. <p> A type of IC technology. COB Chip-on-Board.

Reference-contexts: This limitation was overcome with the development of general purpose computing machines in the early 40s such as the Harvard Mark I (1943) and Bell Labs Model V (1946). Both consisted of a collection of paper tape I/O devices, and multi-precision registers hooked up to arithmetic units <ref> [Wil85] </ref>. <p> This notion became known as the stored program computer and is often attributed to John von Neumann, though it was apparently developed by the original ENIAC team <ref> [Wil85] </ref>. This was a challenging issue at the time because there was no memory technology readily available. The IAS and EDVAC machines both pioneered this concept in the mid 40s, employing either CRT or mercury acoustic delay lines for memory.

Reference-contexts: FPLDs were introduced in the mid-1980s as a quicker alternative to small mask programmed gate arrays, though it could be argued that they were simply an extension of much earlier technologies like fuse-programmable logic arrays <ref> [Xil93b] </ref>. The basic idea that was new to FPLDs was to replace the metal layers that determined the personality of the MPGA or PLA by CMOS pass-gates controlled by bits of SRAM that could be set by the user, rather than in a factory. <p> Of course, for scientific 5 To be concrete, I will assume that a minimum instruction is a 32-bit add, which can be implemented fully parallel in 32 4-LUTs. At 15-gates per LUT (approximate marketing numbers for Altera and Xilinx FPLDs <ref> [Alt95, Xil93b] </ref>), this is 480 gates. or more complicated instructions, such as 64-bit multiply might take closer to 50,000 gates to implement. <p> Gate Capacity Each of the 12 3042s has a nominal capacity of 3500 gates <ref> [Xil93b] </ref>. If we could fill each of the devices, we would achieve a gate count of 42K gates. Although the bit-serial synthesis system described above can come close to this limit because it uses hand-packed macros and has few partitioning bottlenecks, most circuits will not fare so well. <p> The only place where interconnect delays are slightly significant is the clock net: simulations of the clock net show a delay of 3.3 ns and a skew of about 0.9 ns. Table 4.2 shows the various components of the delay and the resulting performance based on <ref> [Xil93b] </ref>. Despite the high performance of the interconnect, the FPMCM has a peak operating 83 frequency of only 20 MHz. The bulk of this delay is in the input and output logic and the programmable interconnect of the FPIC.
