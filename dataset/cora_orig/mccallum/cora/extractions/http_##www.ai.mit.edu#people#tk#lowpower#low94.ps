Abstract: 1 As the clock and logic speeds increase, the energy requirements of CMOS circuits are rapidly becoming a major concern in the design of personal information systems and large computers. Earlier, we presented a new form of CMOS Charge Recovery Logic (CRL), with a power dissipation that falls with the square of the operating frequency, as opposed to the linear drop of conventional CMOS circuits [1]. The technique relied on constructing an explicitly reversible pipelined logic gate, where the information necessary to recover the energy used to compute a value is provided by computing its functional inverse. Information necessary to uncompute the inverse is available from the subsequent inverse logic stage. In this paper, we present a new and greatly simplified form of CRL, we call it Split-Level CRL (SCRL). Using split-level voltages, SCRL differs from our original CRL in that it needs only 2, instead of 16, times as many devices as conventional CMOS, requires only one wire for every signal, instead of 4, and actively drives all outputs during sampling. Furthermore, we will show how to construct SCRL circuits using only 2 external inductors for every chip. Depending on the Q of available inductors, we anticipate energy savings of over 99% per logic operation for logic which is clocked sufficiently slowly.

Reference-contexts: The second and more serious difficulty is the dissipation associated with controlling the action of the power MOSFET. Koller and Athas <ref> [2] </ref> have studied this problem and have shown that dissipation in the power switch forces the energy dissipation of the overall system to follow f 1=2 instead of the theoretical minimum that drops linearly with f .

Reference-contexts: Fortunately, we can partially recover the linear rela 3 tionship between energy dissipation and operating frequency by employing a number of techniques described in <ref> [3] </ref>. SCRL Clocking Variants In what follows, we will describe a number of alternatives for clocking SCRL circuits. These circuits differ primarily by the number of required phases and/or rails that are needed to control their operation. The pipeline described previously in this paper required four-phase clocking.
