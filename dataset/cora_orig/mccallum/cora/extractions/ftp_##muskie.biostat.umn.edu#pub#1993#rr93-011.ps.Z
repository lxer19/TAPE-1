Reference-contexts: While occasionally criticized as too restrictive, conjugate priors offer sufficient flexibility in our highly parametrized model setting, as we show in the next few paragraphs. Values for the parameters of our priors (sometimes called hyperparameters) may sometimes be elicited from clinical experts <ref> (Chaloner et al., 1993) </ref> or past datasets (Lange, Carlin and Gelfand, 1992). In our case, since little is reliably known concerning the CD4 trajectories of late-stage patients receiving ddI or ddC, we prefer to choose hyperparameter values that lead to fairly vague, minimally informative priors.

Reference-contexts: While we have little interest in posterior inference on V 1 , caution is required since a lack of convergence on its part could lead to false inferences concerning the other parameters that do appear to have converged <ref> (Cowles, 1994) </ref>. In this case, the culprit appears to be the large positive autocorrelations present in the chains, a frequent cause of degradation of the Gelman and Rubin statistic in otherwise well-behaved samplers.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, our model could be described graphically as in Figure 1, and subsequently analyzed in BUGS <ref> (Gilks, Thomas and Spiegelhalter, 1992) </ref>. This graphical modeling and Bayesian sampling computer package frees the user from these 7 computational details, though the current BUGS restriction to univariate nodes complicates our longitudinal model specification substantially.
