Abstract: Inductive machine learning offers techniques for discovering new knowledge from business, medical, and scientific databases. Most techniques assume that all the relevant information for discovery has been gathered and assembled into a single table or database. With multiple databases it is possible to combine features from several perspectives and thus move beyond the confines of an ontology that was fixed by the designers of a single database. We introduce WoRLD ("Worldwide Relational Learning Daemon"), a system that uses spreading activation to enable inductive learning from multiple tables in multiple databases spread across the network. We describe the paradigm and the system, provide demonstrations on synthetic data sets, and then replicate two real-world successes of automated discovery.

Reference-contexts: The spreading-activation learning methodology accomodates hierarchical background knowledge naturally. Classifications of objects can be represented using ISA links. Markers are propagated across these also, and unifying concepts can consist of classes as well as individual values. Second, ISA hierarchies can also include more complex inheritance structures. In <ref> [1] </ref>, we describe a system that acco-modates ISA hierarchies, role structures, and non-monotonic inheritance. Finally, there is no limit on the number of joins that the method will accomodate.

Reference-contexts: WoRLD was able to replicate KBRL's discovery without the need to manually link the databases into a single inheritance network. In the second replication, WoRLD successfully reproduced previously known concept definitions that identify high-risk pneumonia patients <ref> [4] </ref>. 4 CONCLUSIONS The system described in this paper allows database maintainers to link their databases to others on the network for learning. The WoRLD system not only uses local links to foreign databases, but can also follow a series of links through databases on the network.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION Inductive machine learning offers methods for discovering new knowledge from business, medical, and scientific databases. Although the need to learn across multiple tables has been realized <ref> [17] </ref>, most inductive learning and data mining techniques assume that all the relevant information for discovery has been gathered and assembled into a single table or database. <p> This requires a domain expert to determine which databases and which fields within them are relevant. Combining multiple databases also creates scaling problems for discovery programs. Even recent work that has begun to address the problem of learning across multiple databases <ref> [17] </ref> requires that the databases reside on the same machine. In practice, useful databases may exist in remote locations in an organization, or across the Internet, and in either case, their existence may not be known to the persons initiating an inquiry.
