Reference-contexts: Layered coding is important for the efficient use of high-speed packet-switching networks. The main issue for such network architectures is the significant congestion control problems that can arise due to the statistical multiplexing of many very high burstiness signals <ref> [1] </ref>. A key property of any congestion control approach not based on resource reservation at the peak rate of the sources is the ability to shed load quickly and without causing an avalanche of retransmissions of dropped traffic.

Reference-contexts: We experimented with a Fore Systems ASX-100 ForeRunner ATM switch and Fore Systems TCA-100 Turbochannel adapters. The ASX-100 is a 16 port non-blocking switch using a TDM bus running at 2.5 Gb/s with output queueing <ref> [2] </ref>. The host adapters were based on the 100 Mb/s TAXI chip-set using multimode fiber and are programmed I/O devices [2]. The device driver and application programming library support AAL3/4, AAL5, and a null AAL, as well as the standard Berkeley sockets interface. <p> The ASX-100 is a 16 port non-blocking switch using a TDM bus running at 2.5 Gb/s with output queueing <ref> [2] </ref>.

The device driver and application programming library support AAL3/4, AAL5, and a null AAL, as well as the standard Berkeley sockets interface. The driver performs all protocol processing in software, including segmentation and reassembly, with the exception of the CRC computation for AAL3/4. <p> The driver performs all protocol processing in software, including segmentation and reassembly, with the exception of the CRC computation for AAL3/4. Signaling is performed with Fore's proprietary Simple Protocol for ATM Network Signaling (SPANS) <ref> [2] </ref>. Virtual-circuits (VCs) are uni directional and can have multiple destinations. Due to the bus-based architecture of the switch, support of multicasting is straight-forward and efficient. A bit mask is stored with each VCI indicating the destination port (s) of a VC.

Reference-contexts: We also discuss the impact of these techniques on application programming. We are investigating the communications aspects of layered (also referred to as hierarchical or subband) coding techniques for video dissemination over packet-switching networks. Layered coding (LC) techniques split signals into components of varying importance <ref> [4, 3] </ref>. The aggregation of these components reconstructs the original signal, but subsets of the data can also provide various degrees of approximation. Layered coding is important for the efficient use of high-speed packet-switching networks.

Reference-contexts: In particular, some other LC techniques we have used in other prototypes (e.g., quad-tree coding and bit-plane separation) demonstrated severe performance problems because of inadequate system support <ref> [8, 7] </ref>. The frame interleaving technique basically achieves a reduction in the rate required for the high priority component to be transmitted and also smoothes out the streams, particularly from the perspective of a receiver receiving just one stream.
