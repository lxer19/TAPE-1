White, </author> <title> "Multipole-accelerated capacitance extraction algorithms for 3-D structures with multiple dielectrics," </title> <journal> IEEE Trans. on CAS I: Fundamental Theory and App., </journal> <volume> vol. 39, </volume> <pages> pp. 946-954, </pages> <month> November </month> <year> 1992. </year>
Reference-contexts: The other category is using the integral equation approach such as Method of Moments (MoM) [4], Boundary Element Method (BEM) [5], and BEM with multipole acceleration <ref> [1] </ref>. They make meshes on the surface of the object. Compared to FD, this greatly reduces the number of unknowns. But each small piece is either source or field point, and affected by all others, which leads to a full matrix. <p> Using this method, the calculation of MEI coefficients represents small percentage of the total computing time. In this paper, we extended Geometry Independent MEI to compute capacitance matrix of general three-dimension interconnects. The results are in good agreement with published data and those obtained by using FASTCAP <ref> [1] </ref>. GIMEI is generally an order of magnitude faster than FASTCAP and uses significantly less memory than FASTCAP. 2 Problem Formulation A general interconnect configuration is shown in Fig. 1. <p> Example 3. A simple cube with different longitude This is a simple example of 1 fi 1 fi z cube (unit is meter for simplicity) is computed and compared with FASTCAP <ref> [1] </ref>. Table 2 shows the capacitance of the cube varying with the extended edge z by GIMEI compared with those of FASTCAP as well as the CPU time of the two methods.

Reference-contexts: The various procedures to get the solution can be generally classified into two categories. One category is to solve differential Maxwell equations called domain methods, such as Finite Element Method (FEM) <ref> [2] </ref> and Finite Difference Method (FDM) [3]. They basically divide the space surrounding the object into meshes, then write local equations at each mesh point, which leads to a sparse matrix system.

Example 5. A bend with numerical experimental on proper selection of buffer number A simple right-angel bend is shown in Fig.6, where all dimensions are in meters. This configuration is actually got from <ref> [3] </ref>. Using GIMEI, the results (self capacitance of the bend) is 2:974nF with 1:16sec: CPU time, while FASTCAP got 2:956nF with 16:1sec: CPU time. GIMEI is more than ten times faster than FASTCAP. It should be noticed that in the original paper [3], the result is 105F which is unreasonable. <p> This configuration is actually got from <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, complicated Green's function and disagreeable Sommerfeld integrals make the traditional MEI very difficult, if not impossible, to be applied to analyze multilayer and multiconductor interconnects. Recently, a MEI variety called Geometry Independent MEI (GIMEI) was proposed <ref> [10] </ref> which was verified to be extremely computationally efficient, and has been successfully used to solve two-dimension VLSI interconnect problems. <p> It has been demonstrated that the MEI are also independent of the source distribution on the measuring loop <ref> [10] </ref>. The MEI coefficients are then determined from the metrons on the measuring loop instead of the metrons on the conductors, which means the MEI are independent of the geometries of the conductors. <p> The measuring loop concept has already been successfully applied to extract 2D parasitics of multilayer multiconductor interconnects <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> A difference of less than 3% is observed in the whole range between our results and the measured data [19]. It's clear from the figure that our results are closer to the measured data than those obtained by standard Finite Difference method (FD). As stated in <ref> [10] </ref>, GIMEI outperforms all methods for fairly large structures such as tens even hundreds of conductors on tens of dielectric layers.

Reference-contexts: These properties make the MEI approach a powerful tool for computational elec-tromagnetics. Recently, although some papers <ref> [11, 12] </ref> propose some doubts on the third postulation of the MEI coefficients, invariant to excitations, they still admit that MEI is an efficient technique to truncate mesh boundaries.

Reference-contexts: not conflict with the fundamentals of MEI, because we have already proven that MEI coefficients are actually not strictly invariant to excitations, but instead, are invariant to excitations with the error bounded by O (h 2 ), where h = max (h x ; h y ; h z ) <ref> [13] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the tedious deduction of Green's function in a multilayer structure, the calculation of the MEI coefficients is very time-consuming because many Sommerfeld type integrals will be encountered, which makes the calculation of MEI coefficients dominate the total computation time. As reported in <ref> [14] </ref>, for a one-layer microstrip stub, obtaining the MEI coefficients required 90 CPU minutes for a single frequency, and solving the sparse system required 24 minutes.

Reference-contexts: From the solution of Eq. 5, we get the potential distribution over the mesh region. We use Duncan correction <ref> [15] </ref> to get charge distribution or total charge on each conductor. Bringing these charges into definition, we can get the final short circuit capacitance matrix. 5 Experimental Results To verify the accuracy and efficiency of this method, the following examples were selected to provide a quantitative measure.
