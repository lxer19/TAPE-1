Reference-contexts: Only the six indicated restrictions are, in fact, required for the grammar to be learned correctly. Indeed it would make more sense to talk about what constituents are not allowed, rather than those which are. In this sense we have something close in spirit to the "distituent grammar" of <ref> [6] </ref>. Having looked at the results of learning runs in which the above constraints were violated, it is possible to assign "purposes" to most of the above restrictions although to what degree these are idiosyncratic to the grammar at hand only further experimentation will show.

Reference-contexts: It should also be noted that none of the grammars found in the experiment were the correct grammar. This indicates that there are, in fact, a considerable number of local minima, and that this is indeed a problem. Wyard <ref> [8] </ref> found a similar problem with local minima in his genetic algorithm approach. In general, the incorrect grammars found in these experiments are characterized by large numbers of long rules (compared to the correct grammar).
