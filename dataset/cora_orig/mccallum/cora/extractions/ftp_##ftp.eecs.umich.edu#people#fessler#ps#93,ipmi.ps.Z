Abstract: The conventional method for tomographic image reconstruction, convolution backprojection (CBP), attempts to reduce the effects of measurement noise by radial smoothing with a spatially-invariant filter. Spatially-invariant smoothing is suboptimal when the measurement statistics are nonstationary, and often leads to a choice between over-smoothing or streak artifacts. In this paper, we describe a nonstationary sinogram smoothing method that accounts for the relative variances between different detector measurements and for the finite width of to-mographic detectors. The method is based on an information-weighted smoothing spline, where the weights are determined from the calibration factors and from the measurements themselves. This weighting diminishes the influence of high variance measurements, such as detectors with relatively poor efficiency, which is shown to reduce streak artifacts. Simulations of emission and transmission tomography applications demonstrate qualitatively improved image noise structure and quantitative im provements in the tradeoffs between bias and variance.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The CBP method for tomographic reconstruction is derived from a mathematical idealization of tomographic imaging without consideration of statistical measurement errors. This idealization leads to the well-known ramp filter <ref> [1] </ref>, whose frequency response has the unfortunate effect of amplifying high-frequency measurement noise. The conventional approach to reducing the effects of measurement noise is to apodize the ramp filter with a window function that attenuates the high frequencies [1]. <p> This idealization leads to the well-known ramp filter <ref> [1] </ref>, whose frequency response has the unfortunate effect of amplifying high-frequency measurement noise. The conventional approach to reducing the effects of measurement noise is to apodize the ramp filter with a window function that attenuates the high frequencies [1]. This windowing is equivalent to radially smoothing the projection measurements with a spatially-invariant low-pass filter. In high resolution tomographs, such as positron emission tomography (PET) systems based on block detectors, large variations in detector efficiency lead to nonstationary variances.

Reference-contexts: The latter option often leads to streak artifacts in the reconstructed images, due to the backprojection of noise that has been amplified by the ramp filter. (See Fig. 8 for an example.) To remove these streak artifacts after reconstruction, Abidi and Davis <ref> [2] </ref> proposed a filtering method based on transforming the reconstructed images from rectangular to polar coordinates. Sauer and Liu [3] describe a related method for images composed of objects with known location, extent, and density.

Reference-contexts: Sauer and Liu <ref> [3] </ref> describe a related method for images composed of objects with known location, extent, and density. A fundamental difference between these approaches and the spline method described below is that we perform nonstationary smoothing of the projection data before ramp-filtering and backprojecting.

Reference-contexts: The method we describe is not optimal; a more principled approach to remedying the statistical shortcomings of CBP is iterative image reconstruction based on statistical models. In fact, our motivation for this study developed from experiences with penalized weighted least-squares reconstruction <ref> [4] </ref>. In that work we have compared regularized least-squares reconstruction with and without information weighting. The noise properties of information-weighted reconstructed images appeared superior to those of CBP, but the noise properties of unweighted reconstructions were no better than those of CBP [4]. <p> developed from experiences with penalized weighted least-squares reconstruction <ref> [4] </ref>. In that work we have compared regularized least-squares reconstruction with and without information weighting. The noise properties of information-weighted reconstructed images appeared superior to those of CBP, but the noise properties of unweighted reconstructions were no better than those of CBP [4]. This suggests that accounting for the measurement statistics, or in particular the second moments of those statistics, is central to the improvements in iterative methods. The spline method described below is an attempt to capture part of the benefits of statistical modeling in a non-iterative algorithm.

Reference-contexts: We would like to recover l (t ) from fz i g. Since direct deconvolution would be amplify the noise, we include a smoothness constraints.

Reference-contexts: Since this estimate may be unreliable for small y i , a sensible weighting is w 2 i = c 2 i = maxfy i ; Kg, for some K &gt; 0. For transmission tomography, a Taylor's expansion <ref> [11] </ref> gives the following variance estimate: 1=^ 2 i = y i . For robustness to small projection measurements, we use the following weights: w 2 i = maxfy i ; Kg. These data-based weightings introduce a slight nonlinearity into the estimation.

Reference-contexts: For robustness to small projection measurements, we use the following weights: w 2 i = maxfy i ; Kg. These data-based weightings introduce a slight nonlinearity into the estimation. If one desired lin earity, for example in order to apply a generalization of Huesman's ROI formulae <ref> [12] </ref>, then one could use weights determined only from the relative calibration factors fc i g, and from the projection of a "prototypical object" such as a uniform disk. For very noisy data, one could conceivably improve on this weighting scheme by applying iteratively reweighted least-squares [13].

Reference-contexts: For very noisy data, one could conceivably improve on this weighting scheme by applying iteratively reweighted least-squares <ref> [13] </ref>. As described in the Appendix, it follows from the Euler-Lagrange formulae for the variational problem (2) that its minimizer is a spline of order 2m.

Reference-contexts: The spline has an even order because of our use of the integral model p i = R t r t l p (t ) dt in (1). In the nonparametric regression literature, a point-sample model p i = p (t i ) is more conventional (although see <ref> [14] </ref> for an exception). The point-sample model results in odd order splines, such as the popular cubic spline for m = 2. The integral approach more naturally captures the finite width of tomographic detectors.

Reference-contexts: The point-sample model results in odd order splines, such as the popular cubic spline for m = 2. The integral approach more naturally captures the finite width of tomographic detectors. As outlined in the Appendix, the coefficients of the smoothing spline are easily computed noniteratively using fast banded-matrix operations <ref> [15] </ref>. The computation generally increases with m, so we focus our attention on the case m = 1. Despite this restriction, the simulations described in Section 4 demonstrate that the smoothing spline outperforms Butterworth filters over a range of cutoff frequencies and orders. The spline approach has two side benefits. <p> is easily performed using a trick due to Reinsch [18], giving the following expression for the spline coefficients: ^ a = z fiWQ 0 ^ b; where (T + fiQWQ 0 ) ^ b = Qy: This latter system of equations is solved using a Cholesky decomposition for banded matrices <ref> [15] </ref>, which requires only O (n) operations.

Reference-contexts: However, in high noise applications in which significant smoothing will be required, a linear interpolator will often suffice. More importantly, the spline approach directly accommodates unevenly spaced detector samples. This is desirable for circular PET systems and many nonstandard tomographic systems <ref> [16] </ref>. It is perhaps worth emphasizing in this context that we are not simply performing spline interpolation.

Reference-contexts: Such a comparison would be particularly meaningful if both methods were also compared to lower bounds. We are currently investigating an approach for computing bounds that is practical for tomography <ref> [17] </ref>. Furthermore, comparisons of bias and variance only explore one dimension of an estimator's statistics. Since our images suggest that the noise structure of ordinary CBP and spline-smoothing CBP are different, the noise autocorrelations should be examined and compared.
