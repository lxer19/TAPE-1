Title: ECS 223: Parallel Algorithms  Problem 1 Text Problem 1.1

Note: (a) All 8 people are sitting in a circle.

Abstract: One person can add n numbers in time t c (n 1) by either using a linear method (i.e. adding each of the first n1 terms to the last one) or by a tree-like strategy (i.e. add together adjacent pairs to make a new list with size half the original). With 8 people, we can distribute the work and use some parallelism to reduce the total time taken. We are given two arrangements for the 8 people: We can use the following strategy to add n numbers: hand n=8 numbers to p 1 ; p 2 ; : : : ; p 8 . Now each person adds his n=8 numbers in time t c n=8. Next 4 parallel passes occur from p 1 to p 8 , p 2 to p 3 , p 7 to p 6 , and p 4 to p 5 (indicated by solid lines in the figure). Now 4 parallel additions occur, then 2 more numbers are passed from p 3 through p 4 to p 5 , and p 8 through p 7 to p 6 (indicated by dashed lines in the figure). Two more parallel additions occur, and finally p 6 passes his sum to p 5 (dotted line in the figure) and p 5 produces a final sum. This method requires time t c n=8 + 4t w + 3t c .
