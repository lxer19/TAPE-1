Reference-contexts: Given the various efforts to mimic the materials and methods of Kumon, some degree of corporate caution is natural, but an opening of doors in both directions is most desirable. The cultural milieu Kumon grew up in Japan, where the educational curriculum is a national treasure <ref> (the National Course of Study, cf. Becker et al. 1990) </ref>, where a government-appointed committee to encourage more relaxation ended up working nights and weekends to complete its report, and where many mothers remain at home to attend to the education of their children.

Counting hardware and software, this works out to $900 per pupil. Given the 43 million students, this amounts to about $40 billion to be spread over five years. The NCTM Standards recommend more work with computers in the classroom.

Reference-contexts: His earliest work was in the biological sciences, and he drew upon biological models for inspiration throughout his long and fruitful career (40+ books, continuing into his 80's) <ref> (Boden 1979) </ref>. Any biological entity constantly assimilates (absorbs) some of its environment and accommodates (adapts to) the rest of it. Piaget visualized the development of mind as the outcome of a ceaseless "equilibration" between these two methods of relating to the mind's environment.

Reference-contexts: As Shields notes, more difficult problem-solving requires a confidence that is not shaken when answers are protracted. Shields, Tocci and Engelhard all indite the absence of such confidence as a significant factor in the mathematics gender gap. Bruner observes that "Learners do not learn much in an anxious environment." <ref> (Bruner 1966, p. 52) </ref> Also, "... cognitive or intellectual mastery is rewarding. <p> stimulus. (A more mature response is one mediated by more knowledge.) Such growth depends upon internalizing events into a consultable world model (like Gagne's), and is identified by the enlarged capacity to use words or symbols to say to oneself or to others what one has done or will do <ref> (Bruner 1966) </ref>. He identified (1966) three mechanisms of learning which appear in the following order in the life of the child, but persist through adulthood: (1) enacting: This is knowledge encoded in doing. To reproduce such learning, the learner must "act it out" as in music and sports. <p> Gradually such learning may be replaced by summary images (icons), and later by representation in words and other symbols, leading to the next two categories. (2) iconic: This is knowledge which is encoded in diagrammatic representations, and decoded and employed by the application of "syntactic transformations" <ref> (Bruner 1966, p. 11) </ref>. (3) symbolic: Eventually information is encoded as symbols such as words, numbers, and conceptual maps. Such symbols are powerfully evocative and give rise to the conjectural realms of possibilities. <p> Bruner adds, "[C]ompacting or condensing [through icons and, later, symbols] is the means by which we fill our seven slots with gold rather than dross." <ref> (Bruner 1966, p. 12) </ref> Such learning corresponds closely to the gestalt theory. Gestalt is a German word without a simple English equivalent, but it has the sense of form/structure/relation kindred to my use of syntax and Bruner's use of icon. <p> This is best illustrated by an example which Bruner borrowed from Dr. J. Richard Hayes <ref> (Bruner 1966, p. 46-8) </ref>: Suppose the domain of knowledge consists of available plane service within a twelve-hour period between five cities in the Northeast Concord, New Hampshire, Albany, New York, Danbury, Connecticut, Elmira, New York, and Boston, Massachusetts. <p> doing, [my emphasis] or upon the development of appropriate imagery, or upon symbolic-verbal encoding [syntactic learning, in our phrase], it is often possible to render the end result to be achieved in a simpler, more manageable form so that the child can move more easily and deeply to full mastery." <ref> (Bruner 1966, p. 30) </ref> For example, Papert (1980, p. 185) notes the degree to which this was accomplished in skiing. For years, learners on the snowy slopes labored through an elaborate ritual of pole planting, edge setting, unweighting etc. and few achieved crisp parallel turns without protracted effort. <p> Perhaps the best way to make them so is to make them more powerful in the hands of their users." <ref> (Bruner 1966, p. 112) </ref> We must teach students the medium of mathematics as well as its message.

Reference-contexts: The system depends upon individual profiles of the strengths and weaknesses of each learner. One of the stumbling blocks of artificially intelligent tutoring systems is the accuracy and usefulness of the learning model <ref> (Kearsley 1987 and Clancey 1987) </ref>. Representations of current knowledge and skills, desired knowledge and skills, and the process by which one moves from the former to the latter are part of such a model. The expert system must make constant assumptions about such learning.

(Gribbin 1984, p. 103) Einstein commented frequently on the significant role of intuition in his discoveries, especially general relativity <ref> (Clark 1971, pp. 53, 118, 222, 588-590) </ref>. Of the latter, he said: Once the validity of this mode of thought [i.e. general relativity] has been recognized, the final results appear almost simple; any intelligent undergraduate can understand them without much trouble.

Reference-contexts: Much less emphasis is placed on individual work. Students of varying ability are mixed (heterogeneous classes); stronger students are expected to strengthen their knowledge by communicating it with others. This also serves to empower students more equally than systems that visibly place some learners above others <ref> (Cobb et al. 1991) </ref>. The Standards include many examples of classroom scenarios illustrating the teaching of mathematics by socioconstructivist methods. This is an aspect of learning that Kumon simply doesn't address. As discussed earlier, the "Kumon community" does provide supportive elements, but the learning is fundamentally individual.

Although average response time was thought important at first, later versions de-emphasized it. Also, they discovered that the most effective learning interval was ten minutes per day.

Reference-contexts: In recent years this has come to be called the "constructivist" approach to the study of the learning of mathematics, an approach that has developed though work of Piaget, Papert, Lawler (1986), Easley, Ginsburg, Thompson, Steffe, Duckworth, Erlwanger, and others. <ref> (Davis 1984, p. 92) </ref> In the Kumon classroom, the small amount of "teaching" that occurs is one-on-one, giving rise over the years to considerable knowledge about how children learn. <p> its face though, "new math" was really dozens of programs over a wide diversity of models, most of which were generally ignored by American school systems: "In those few schools where they were extensively and carefully implemented, the best of the new curricula produced very pronounced gains in student performance" <ref> (Davis 1984, pp. 312f.) </ref>. Its worthiest new element is the paradigm teaching strategy. Paradigms are visual metaphors for abstract concepts (cf. "Art, Math & Other Things" in Holt 1983). For example, a meter-tall set of balance scales can be used to "guess" the number of marbles in sealed envelopes. <p> Long division WUCS-91-49 Kumon: An Educator's Perspective Fuller Page 46 is a visually-moderated sequence for nearly all of us! "The process by which the bits and pieces of a VMS sequence are united into a single entity an integrated sequence must be one of the fundamental processes in learning mathematics." <ref> (Davis 1984, p. 37) </ref> Davis compares this process of constant integration to sports learning. Coaches analyze batting with a detail that is incomprehensible to the layman stances, wrists, pointing of toes and so forth. Yet batters have to apply this learning in less than half a second. <p> Debugging Student errors are not so random as once imagined. On the contrary, student errors turn out to be quite regular and systematic, and it is often possible to predict exactly which wrong answers are most likely for a particular student <ref> (Davis 1984, p. 43) </ref>. These may be caused by buggy procedures or frames, or by summoning up the wrong one for a particular problem. For example, after years of addition problems, children tend to ignore the operation sign. <p> Such reflection leads to meta-cognition an element of Gagne's cognitive strategies which he calls executive control cognizance of the process from outside of the process. Comparable thought assistants are elsewhere called self-critics and deamons. They aid the learner in self- debugging <ref> (Davis 1984, Turkle 1984) </ref>. They are reminders peering over the mental shoulder muttering, "Hmm, that doesn't look right." There is a significant gap between algorithmic processing and the recognition of meaning; students who merely memorize definitions tend to do very poorly. <p> This is especially true in the development of this meta-cognition in problem-solving. "What is required in the learning of mathematics is not the verbatim repeating of verbal statements, but the synthesis of appropriate mental frames to represent the concepts and procedures of mathematics" <ref> (Davis 1984, pp. 200ff.) </ref>. Why do some errors persist when the student and teacher both work hard to correct them? Perhaps, the vastness of memory and relative smallness of the active workbench lead to awkward partitioning, faulty retrieval, and flawed control mechanisms. <p> We move far too slowly for most of the class, causing boredom which blocks conceptual learning <ref> (Davis 1984, cf. Slavin 1991, Chapter 11) </ref>. The concepts are best formed, and actually only formed, by the learner. <p> Its reliance on drill and worksheets (even if computerized), automatically alienates it from many. For all the talk about individual learning and the clear indications that each learner must build her own cognitive structures, we still rely far more on lecturing and board work <ref> (Davis 1984, Mullis et al. 1991, Parker and Kurtz 1990) </ref>. As important as are the skills of communicating mathematics, they cannot overcome individual accountability for learning some math to communicate.

Reference-contexts: The sociocon <p>- WUCS-91-49 Kumon: An Educator's Perspective Fuller Page 41 structivist enlarges this episodic support into a community that continually supports and stimulates active learning. Socioconstructivism is the learning theory most directly associated with the vision of the NCTM Standards <ref> (Davis et al. 1990, Cobb et al. 1991) </ref>. In supporting this vision, Davis observes that modern science, technology, manufacturing even farming depend increasingly on mathematics. Our society is not only more mathematical, but more interconnected, than ever.

Reference-contexts: Holden, Science, June 30, 1989, qtd. in Moore 1990). None would deny these needs, but hasn't mathematics another mission beyond economic needs, namely to liberate the mind of the individual thinker <ref> (Dewey 1938, Paul Hirst 1965) </ref>? Hirst includes mathematics as one of his seven forms or intellectual frameworks of human thinking. (Other forms are physical science, language and fine arts, social science, and so on.) He holds that the human mind requires a thorough "initiation" into each of these forms in order <p> Some of this knowledge is shared within the program by seminars, internal publications, videotapes, etc., but virtually none finds its way into the professional (English) literature. "Rote" versus "meaningful" learning If "higher-order" thinking is to be for everyone, how shall it be taught? Educators from John Dewey <ref> (Dewey 1938, p. 27) </ref> to the NCTM have decried the unthinking drill remote from anything useful or interesting in the life of the learner.

Certainly, nothing learned in a calculus class approaches the number and speed of calculations necessary to grab a firefly on wing or swat a softball. <p> The introduction of back propagation learning, and the dramatic improvement in single chip processors have put the millions of repetitions necessary for this approach within reach of the "palmtop" computer. The basic scheme is elegantly simple grossly suggested by the neural connections of the brain <ref> (Duff 1986, Barlow 1990, Montgomery 1989) </ref> . A network is some fixed number of inputs is connected to some fixed number of outputs. These two layers may be connected through many intermediate layers. The connections are weighted; not all "votes" are counted equally.

Reference-contexts: The psychomotor domain embraces muscular coordination. It is evident in activities such as handwriting, dance, and athletics.

Although this may bear more of a relation to learning in the other domains than is generally recognized, it was the last domain to be developed, and has received the least attention from educators. <p> Gagne suggested (as had Dewey before him) the importance of concrete experiences with weights, blocks, and familiar manipulable objects to assist the learning of mathematical concepts. In later works <ref> (Gagne 1984) </ref>, this is generalized to "discovery learning" sudden insights or reorganizations of the student's field of experience.

Reference-contexts: Also, the time constraints help students learn to stay on task, to concentrate, and to focus. Further research is needed to assess the significance of these systemic differences in the longitudinal (mathematical and non-mathematical) successes of Kumon-taught students. Gagne <ref> (Gagne and Fleishman 1959) </ref> added to the traditional behavioral model significant refinements such as "differential sensory detection....retained, or stored by means of a neural mechanism called memory," anticipating cognitive science in one aspect.

Reference-contexts: Goal 4. US students will be first in the world in science and mathematics achievement. ... To reach the fourth goal, we must reverse a quarter century of poor US showing in international comparisons. In a massive study from 1959 to 1966, involving 132,775 students in twelve industrialized nations <ref> (Husen 1967) </ref>, US thirteen-year-olds barely edged ahead of their Swedish peers for next to last in math skills.

Reference-contexts: To others, education should be the vehicle of cultural transmission; and if so, then whose culture (Adler 1982 and 1984, Friere 1968, Martin 1981)? Are these three broad goals societal, individual, cultural at odds or coincident? <ref> (Cf. Kamens and Benavot 1991.) </ref> Who should decide the goals and how can they be assessed? Some suggest that the real decision has already succumbed to political forces, and has swung well into the conservative camp in recent years (Shor 1986).

Reference-contexts: This view of learning continued in some degree in the programmed instruction texts that blossomed in the 1960's, reemerged as programmed learning on centralized mainframe computers in the 1970's, and flowered in the 1980's on microcomputers <ref> (e.g. Kearsley 1987) </ref>. The Math Skills Ladder developed by SRA (Science Research Associates, educational subsidiary of IBM) is representative of this genre. Assigned to advanced students for enrichment, and to less advanced students for remediation, it emphasized individualized learning and the fine- grained stepwise decomposition of subject matter. <p> The system depends upon individual profiles of the strengths and weaknesses of each learner. One of the stumbling blocks of artificially intelligent tutoring systems is the accuracy and usefulness of the learning model <ref> (Kearsley 1987 and Clancey 1987) </ref>. Representations of current knowledge and skills, desired knowledge and skills, and the process by which one moves from the former to the latter are part of such a model. The expert system must make constant assumptions about such learning.

Reference-contexts: In fact, even at a time when I had played more computer games than she had, she was able to progress quickly past me in significantly fewer hours than I had invested. Later in this paper, I consider the significance of the tight loop from eye to finger tips <ref> (Penfield and Rasmussin, qtd. in Kimura 1990) </ref>. This stimulus-response loop must not only be tight and flexible, but highly trainable in childhood. A rather bucolic example of pattern processing is the determination of the gender of new chicks. <p> Hyperflow is intended to be used not only as an end user language, but also as a system implementation language. Penfield and Rasmussen noted the disproportionate share of the human motor cortex given to the control of the fingers and eyes <ref> (Kimura 1990) </ref>. The eye-fingertip loop enables remarkable dexterousness. Artists and musicians exploit this to wonderful effect. The focal point of the pianist, violinist, guitarist, cellist, and many others is precisely at the fingertip.

Reference-contexts: In even a broader context, the poverty of the educational environment (decaying facilities, unsupportive parents, absent role models, exhausted or uncaring teachers) remains the most intractable dimension of the learning challenge <ref> (see Mullis et al. 1991, Kozol 1991) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Advocates of the Kumon philosophy further claim that concepts should be positioned well behind the mastery of facilities to not undermine the successful acquisition of the former. The affective domain <ref> (Krathwohl et al. 1964) </ref> relates to feelings and values in the learner. It is ordered by increasing internalization of the values being presented to the learner: receiving (attending), responding, valuing, organizing (conceptualizing), and characterization (incorporation into patterns of living).

Reference-contexts: This attitude may be based less on world-class studies, and more on US-normed tests, which like "grades on the curve," are subject to glacial drift with the ability of both teachers and students. Exemplifying this tendency, some <ref> (such as Lester and Kroll 1991) </ref> propose grading schemes that give 75 to 80% of full credit for well-explained approaches that merely fail to get correct answers.

Reference-contexts: single-parent households, this workforce is rarely available in the US, rendering more difficult the steady support of the learning effort. (Ironically, the growing number of Japanese two-career households is slowly fomenting a similar shift there.) Some resistance to Kumon stems from its Japanese origin for reasons both economic and ethnic <ref> (Lewis and Guidry 1990) </ref>. Some parents are irritated by the many stray Japanese characters in margins, on answer sheets, and on certificates. Although not readily substantiated, this prejudice seems to have been less of a barrier to American minorities.

Reference-contexts: The last three words point to both problem and solution. The teacher is necessarily the final gatekeeper for the conduct of learning in the classroom <ref> (cf. Mann 1990) </ref>. The Kumon machine may find its way into some regular schools (as has the Kumon method itself for about 30,000 children). The great majority of users will more likely be supplementing their regular schooling (as do the million other Kumon students), bypassing public gatekeepers altogether.

Reference-contexts: Computer scientists have formulated sophisticated syntax rules (axiomatic semantics) that completely express the semantic content of a well-defined symbol set.

Multiplication merely represents strings of addition. Familiar symbols are used to build bridges to new symbols and new meanings.

Reference-contexts: Piaget visualized the development of mind as the outcome of a ceaseless "equilibration" between these two methods of relating to the mind's environment. The mind assimilates some of its environment and accommodates (through internal reformation) other elements of it <ref> (Slavin 1991, Chapter 2) </ref>. The earliest growth of higher animals follows a well-defined pattern: the fertilized egg develops differentiated and specialized cells, then organs, then systems for digestion, vision, energy transfer, and structural support. Piaget described the analogous growth of cognitive "organs" called schemata.

Reference-contexts: Educational theories necessarily build upon widely varying assumptions about the nature of mind: its genesis, growth, processes, limits, and content (cf. the "strange loop" of Hofstader 1970, the self of Turkle 1984, and Bruner 1983 and 1986). Alas, even the locus of mind or consciousness remains deeply disputed <ref> (Maxfield in Smith 1990, Phillips and Soltis 1985) </ref>. Broadly-held theories consider consciousness an epiphenomenon (a "side effect") of the electrical and chemical processes of the brain. Johnson- Laird likens it to the operating system of all conscious and unconscious processes (1988). <p> Papert postulates the activity of unconscious agents processing, testing, and recombining potential solutions until a compellingly elegant one emerges from the fray, and is reintroduced into consciousness. A cultivated and informed intuition is a powerful ally to mathematical thinking <ref> (cf. Maxfield in Smith 1990, Tell 1980) </ref>. Virtually all educators recognize that mere computation of correct answers is very limited without the support of some conceptual model.

Reference-contexts: Later 3 + 2 can be mastered as the successor to the successor to 3, and so on. There is suggestive WUCS-91-49 Kumon: An Educator's Perspective Fuller Page 57 evidence that children perform early addition in this manner (as successor operations) even when taught other algorithms <ref> (Suppes and Groen 1967) </ref>. Approached from this standpoint, the commutativity of addition is a non-trivial discovery a curious result worthy of amazement and appreciation. If numbers are regarded primarily as cardinal, commutativity is obvious and expected. A different concept has taken the lead. <p> What if we focus on right and wrong exemplars and on syntactic processes and let the internal linkages and structures remain hidden? In fact, even when we teach the the linkages, the real structures are often hidden anyway and stubbornly resist our best efforts to detect and correct them <ref> (Suppes and Groen 1967, Papert 1980, Davis 1984) </ref>. If the examples, practice, checking, and corrective feedback are finely grained, we should detect potentially damaging flaws in the internal structure or representation in time to adjust them and assure the practical soundness of the structures that remain.

Reference-contexts: Occupations in the scientific fields are highly esteemed. To what degree is its success transferable to different cultures, especially to the United States? The education of their children is valued by Japanese parents to a depth not comprehended by most Americans <ref> (White 1987) </ref>. The quality of local schools is a primary criterion in locating the home. Parents expect to make many sacrifices for their children's learning, and consequently expect much from it. Family travel plans will be changed, or even cancelled, to accommodate homework demands.

Reference-contexts: Certainly we can't rely on mere observation the most important part is invisible. Asking the learner helps sometimes, but a class size of even twenty-five precludes more than a slender sample of real thinking. Also, neither children or adults are very good at verbalizing their actual algorithms. <ref> (Cf. Wood 1989, Chapter 2) </ref> Sometimes they are afraid that they will sound inappropriate or wrong.
