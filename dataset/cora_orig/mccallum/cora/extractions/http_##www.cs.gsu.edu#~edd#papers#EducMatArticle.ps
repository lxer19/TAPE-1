Reference-contexts: As a result of such activity students tend to be more successful with Lagrange's theorem and quotient groups <ref> [1] </ref>. They are given the following task to perform. Write an ISETL func PR that accepts a set and a binary operation and returns a func that accepts two inputs which can be any combination of elements of G and/or subsets of G.

Reference-contexts: As the mathematical level of the concepts increase, it is necessary, according to Piaget, to construct new objects, no longer physical but mental, and manipulate these in order to construct mathematical ideas (see, for example, Beth and Piaget <ref> [2] </ref> and Dubinsky [10].) A major problem in mathematics education 5 is to find appropriate substitutes for physical objects. In my work, the computer has been used for this purpose.

Reference-contexts: According to our theoretical perspective, a major reason for the difficulty is that the learner is not able to go beyond an action conception of function and all of these notions require process and/or object conceptions. (See <ref> [3] </ref> for an elaboration of these issues.) Another example of an action conception comes from the notion of a (left or right) coset of a group in abstract algebra. <p> With a process conception of function, an individual can link two or more processes to construct a composition, or reverse the process to obtain inverse functions <ref> [3] </ref>. In abstract algebra, a process understanding of cosets includes thinking about the formation of a set by operating a fixed element with every element in a particular subgroup. Again, it is not necessary to perform the operations, but only to think about them being performed.

Reference-contexts: The computer work is done in a mathematical programming language called ISETL. The syntax of this language is very close to standard mathematical notation and the reader should have little difficulty in interpreting the syntax. For further information about ISETL and its use in education, see <ref> [9] </ref>. 17 We begin our examples with some constructions related to elementary group concepts.

Another obstacle to a Piagetian approach at higher levels of mathematics is that much of Piaget's thinking is related to spontaneous development.

Reference-contexts: As is seen in <ref> [13] </ref> it is not very difficult for learners to work with a coset such as 2 + H = f2; 6; 10; 14; 18g because it is formed either by an explicit listing of the elements obtained by adding 2 to each element of H or applying some rule, e.g., "begin <p> Again, it is not necessary to perform the operations, but only to think about them being performed. Thus, with a process conception, cosets can be formed in situations where formulas are not 14 available. (See, for example, <ref> [13] </ref>.) Object.

Reference-contexts: On these terms, strictly mathematical education is grounded in its natural surroundings of equivalency to objects, and will give full scope to the intelligence which would have remained purely verbal or graphic." ([22], p. 104.) The main strategy for doing this, according to Piaget ([18], p. 85, [23], p. 246, <ref> [14] </ref>, p. 174) is for the teacher to create situations that facilitate the child's discovery or invention of mathematical ideas and to present disequilibrating examples so that the child will develop new ideas in order to re-equilibrate.

This 3 is an area in which education can make a contribution.

Reference-contexts: In Piaget's view, the teacher must begin with the structures that the student has already constructed spontaneously as a result of factors we have described and help the child relate them to mathematical structures as the teacher understands them ([17], p. 72, <ref> [19] </ref>, p. 19, [21], p. 179.) There are, at least, two ways in which the teacher can become able to do this. One is to involve mathematicians.

Reference-contexts: The students do all of this work including their homework and some their examinations in permanent (for the duration of a course) cooperative groups. This provides an environment for social interaction that can enhance the growth of their under standings (and there is specific research attesting to this effect <ref> [27] </ref>.) In this pedagogical system, the teacher's role begins to move from the central figure through which everything happens to one component of the total learning environment.
