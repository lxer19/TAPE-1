Title: PERCEPTION AND CREATION OF DIVERSE ALPHABETIC STYLES

Abstract: The Letter Spirit project explores the creative act of artistic letter-design. The aim is to model how the 26 lowercase letters of the roman alphabet can be rendered in many different but internally coherent styles. Viewed from a distance, the behavior of the program can be seen to result from the interaction of four emergent agents working together to form a coherent style and to design a complete alphabet: the Imaginer (which plays with the concepts behind letterforms), the Drafter (which converts ideas for letterforms into graphical realizations), the Examiner (which combines bottom-up and top-down processing to perceive and categorize letterforms), and the Adjudicator (which perceives and dynamically builds a representation of the evolving style). Creating a gridfont is an iterative process of guesswork and evaluation carried out by the four agents. This process is the "central feedback loop of creativity". Implementation of Letter Spirit is just beginning. This paper outlines our goals and plans for the project.

Reference-contexts: Letterforms are restricted to short line segments on a fixed grid of 21 points arranged in a 3 fi 7 array <ref> ( Hofstadter, 1985 ) </ref> . Legal line segments, called quanta, connect a point to any of its nearest neighbors. There are 56 possible quanta, as shown in Figure 2. Fig. 2. The Letter Spirit grid, with one of the many possible sets of quanta instantiating an `a' turned on.

Reference-contexts: At the beginning of a run, processing in the Visual Focus is purely bottom-up; gradually, however, as structures are built up, top-down influences enter the picture, with top-down processing guiding the "docking" of syntactic parts into semantic slots. This is explained further in <ref> ( Hofstadter and McGraw, 1993 ) </ref> . Structure in the Visual Focus is built up in parallel by many computational micro-agents called codelets. A useful image is that of a large structure (like a bridge) being built by a colony of hundreds of ants. The ants work semi-independently, but cooperatively.

Reference-contexts: It is convenient to speak as if these emergent activities were carried out by four explicit and cleanly separable modules, together comprising the totality of the program. (These agents could be likened to the agents referred to in <ref> ( Minsky, 1985 ) </ref> .) We call these hypothetical agents the Imaginer, the Drafter, the Examiner, and the Adjudicator, and will briefly describe them.
