Reference-contexts: Further extensions of this approach for nonholonomic mobile platforms has been made by Pissard-Gibollet and Rives [15]. Generalization of the curve tracking and estimation problem outlined in Dickmanns for arbitrarily shaped curves addressing both the estimation of the shape parameters as well as control has been explored in <ref> [6] </ref> by Frezza and Picci. <p> expression (8) for fl z , this partial differential equation can be transformed to an infinite-dimensional dynamic system ~ through differentiating 4 This equation is called a Riccati-type PDE since it generalizes the classical well-known Riccati equation for the motion of a homogeneous straight line under rotation around the origin <ref> [6] </ref> [7]. 11 equation (21) with respect to y repeatedly: 0 B B B B B B B _ ~ 1 _ ~ 3 _ ~ i 1 C C C C C C C = B B B B B B B @ sin 2 sin + 1 ~ 1 <p> Therefore, piecewise linear curvature 26 curves are simple as well as good models for most tracking tasks. Comments Strictly speaking, when approximating a given curve by a piecewise polynomial curve, for example by using splines <ref> [6] </ref>, in order to get the estimate of ~ for the evolution of the approximating virtual curve, one has to solve the infinite-dimensional differential equation (22). <p> Basically, there are two different approaches that one might take in order to track such a curve: first, one may use some estimation schemes and based on the estimated features of the real curve to apply the feedback control law (as studied by Frezza and Picci <ref> [6] </ref>); second, one may just smoothly connect these chunks of the image curve by straight lines, arcs or linear curvature curves and then apply the virtual tracking scheme as given in the above to track the approximating virtual curves. 4.3 Simulation Results of Tracking Ground Curves In this section, we show <p> In other words, one has to approximate by simpler curve models which have finite-dimensional dynamics. In Frezza and Picci <ref> [6] </ref>, the models are chosen as third-order B-splines. However, as we have pointed out in Section 2.2.3, the polynomial form is not an intrinsic property of a curve and it cannot be preserved under the motion of the mobile robot. <p> Although, in some sense, both linear curvature curves and third-order B-splines (Frezza and Picci <ref> [6] </ref>) are third-order approximations for general curves, the dimension of the Kalman filter for estimating the B-spline parameters is N + 2 where N is the number of measurements. However, the kalman filter we propose here is only 4-dimensional. <p> We propose that linear curvature curves are very good candidates for being such models. In some sense, linear curvature curves are a third-order approximation for general curves, so are third-order B-splines used by Frezza and Picci <ref> [6] </ref>. However, the Extended Kalman Filters needed to estimate their parameters are 4-dimensional and (N + 2)-dimensional respectively (where N is the number of output measurements).
