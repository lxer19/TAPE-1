Abstract: Modern advanced retrieval systems have two main features that users find particularly useful, which are not found in Boolean or string-matching type systems. First, they attempt to rank results so that those most likely to be relevant are seen soonest. Second, they learn about the users' interest through a type of feedback mechanism. In this Unit we explore ranking and feedback, and discuss the underlying issues in terms of weighting methods, similarity measures, query expansion and screening approaches. Data structures, algorithms, implementation guidelines, and experimental results are given.
