Abstract: One problem of image interpolation refers to magnifying a small image without loss in image clarity. We propose a wavelet based method which estimates the higher resolution information needed to sharpen the image. This method extrapolates the wavelet transform of the higher resolution based on the evolution of the wavelet transform extrema across the scales. By identifying three constraints that the higher resolution information needs to obey, we enhance the reconstructed image through alternating projections onto the sets defined by these constraints.

Reference-contexts: Some existing methods such as bilinear and spline interpolations generate blurred images since they do not utilize any information relevant to preserving the image clarity. To deblur these images, one could use the standard approach of unsharp masking <ref> [1] </ref>. Other methods include modeling the edges or filtering with nonlinear filters to boost the high frequencies needed to make an image look sharper. In this paper, we propose a wavelet based method which estimates the higher resolution information needed to sharpen the image. <p> The lowpass filter used in obtaining the test image is a separable 2-D filter, H (! 1 ; ! 2 ) = H 1 (! 1 )H 1 (! 2 ), where the impulse response of H 1 (!) is <ref> [1; 0; 9; 16; 9; 0; 1] </ref> normalized to H 1 (0) = 1. from performing the enhancement algorithm iteratively twice on the 64fi64 test image (i.e. magnify the 64fi64 image, and then magnify the resulting 128 fi 128 image again using the algorithm). <p> Comparing this image to the bilinearly interpolated image in Figure 7, the enhanced image looks sharper. Figure 8 shows a bilinearly interpolated image followed by unsharp masking with the commonly used discrete Laplacian gradient <ref> [1] </ref> with = 1, iterated twice. The resulting image has very blocky edges which are absent with our method, and it is also not as sharp. For the algorithm variant that does not constrain the signal extrema, ringing effects tend to occur around the edges. <p> Figure 5 shows the 1-D case of the iterated filter where the linear interpolation and unsharp masking impulse responses are, respectively, <ref> [:5; 1; :5] </ref> and [:5; 1 + ; :5], with being a free parameter. Furthermore, because of the change in sampling rate, this operation not only accentuates the high frequency components but also other frequency components from replicates of the original spectrum.

Reference-contexts: The motivation for this algorithm comes from the fact that wavelet transform modulus maxima capture the sharp variations of a signal, and that their evolution across the scales characterizes the local regularity of the signal <ref> [2] </ref>. Discussion will be focused on magnifying the data by a factor of 2 for simplicity, although larger magnification could be achieved through iteratively performing the algorithm. 2. <p> In general, analyzing a 2-D problem treating the two coordinates independently is not an optimal approach. However, for computational feasibility, we propose here to treat the two coordinates separately. Hence, for the wavelet transform, the data is filtered by the separable 2-D filter bank using algorithms proposed by Mallat <ref> [2] </ref>, and each row of the row component (and similarly for the column component) of the image is processed as in the 1-D case. 4. <p> Convergence occurs rather quickly and the reconstruction after obtaining the initial estimates or after 1-2 iterations is acceptable. After 5-10 iterations the image quality is quite good, and the images either do not change discernibly afterwards or they become slightly more blocky. Filters proposed in <ref> [2] </ref> are used in the filter bank. We observe that using regular filters yields better results (less blocky images) than non-regular filters (such as Haar). The values of the extrema are allowed to be within a confidence interval during reconstruction.

Reference-contexts: For a detailed analysis of the projection operator onto V for both 1-D and 2-D signals, the reader is referred to <ref> [3] </ref>. Projection of ( ^ f s ; ^g s ) onto S amounts to assigning values of f to even samples of ^ f s . <p> Once the extrema locations and values are determined, the points in between them must obey monotonicity. The algorithm used in constraining the points to obey monotonicity is described in <ref> [3] </ref>. In general, analyzing a 2-D problem treating the two coordinates independently is not an optimal approach. However, for computational feasibility, we propose here to treat the two coordinates separately.
