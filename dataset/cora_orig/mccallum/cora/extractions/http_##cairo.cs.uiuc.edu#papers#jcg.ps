Abstract: Over the last three years, several encryption algorithms, applied to MPEG video streams, emerged. Most of the algorithms tried to optimize the encryption process with respect to the encryption speed due to the temporal properties of video retieval and display process. In this paper, we will describe, evaluate, and compare five representative MPEG encryption algorithms, Naive Algorithm, Selective Algorithm, Zig-Zag Permutation Algorithm, Video Encryption Algorithm, and Pure Permutation Algorithm, with respect to not only their encryption speed metric, but also their security level and stream size metrics. We will show that there are trade-offs among these metrics and the choice of encryption algorithm will depend on security requirements of the considered multimedia applications.

Reference-contexts: Section 5 summaries the comparison of the algorithms and concludes this paper. 2 MPEG Encryption Algorithms 2.1 Naive Algorithm The most straight-forward method is to encrypt the entire MPEG stream using standard encryption methods such as DES [6]. This is called the naive algorithm approach <ref> [1] </ref>. Naive Algorithm treats the MPEG bit-stream as the traditional text data and does not use any of the special MPEG structures. 2.2 Selective Algorithm There are several proposals which use the features of MPEG layered structures [4,5,3]. These algorithms all fall into the category of Selective Algorithm. <p> However, Agi and Gong have shown that great portions of the video are visible partly because of interframe correlation and mainly from unencrypted I-blocks in the P and B frames. Therefore, encrypting only I frames does not provide a satisfactory security level <ref> [1] </ref>. Meyer and Gadegast have designed a new MPEG-like bit-stream, called SECMPEG, that incorporates selective encryption and additional header information, and has high-speed software z I frame intra-coded frames which are coded independently without reference to other frames. <p> This is because so far there is no effective algorithm to break DES, especially double or triple DES which uses two or three different keys. 3.2 Selective Algorithm The Selective Algorithm which encrypts only I frame does not always provide satisfied security. Agi and Gong <ref> [1] </ref> have shown that great portions of the video are visible partly because of interframe correlation and mainly from unencrypted I-blocks in the P and B frames. Therefore, we need to encrypt all I-blocks in the entire MPEG stream in order to provide the most secure services.

Reference-contexts: Notice that the common thing between compression and encryption is that both try to remove redundant information. Therefore, study of MPEG properties and its statistical behavior leads to the Video Encryption Algorithm <ref> [7] </ref>. 2.4.1 Statistical Behavior of MPEG MPEG is a compression algorithm which removes redundant information from the image sequence. This means that it has a more uniform distribution of byte values and is therefore different from textual data.

SECMPEG can use both standard encryption algorithm DES and RSA <ref> [8] </ref> and implements four levels of security: 1st level encrypts all headers. 2nd level encrypts all headers plus the DC coefficients and lower AC terms of the I-blocks. 3rd level encrypts I frames and all I-blocks in P and B frames. 4th level encrypts all data.

(jB i1 B i0 j = jB i4 B i3 j) It is easy to show that, if a 2 a 4 :::a 2n has no repeated pattern, then the secrecy depends on function E because a 2 a 4 :::a 2n is a one-time pad <ref> [9] </ref> which is well-known to be perfectly secure. 2.5 Pure Permutation Algorithm Based on the statistical results from last section, we can see that the byte stream of MPEG video has a very low occurrency of digrams (pair of bytes).

Reference-contexts: SECMPEG is not compatible with standard MPEG. A special encoder/decoder would be required to view unencrypted SECMPEG streams. 2.3 ZigZag-Permutation Algorithm ZigZag-Permutation Algorithm presents a method where the encryption is an integral part of the MPEG compression process <ref> [10] </ref>. The basic idea is that, instead of mapping the 8x8 block to a 1x64 vector in "zig-zag" order, it uses a random permutation list to map the individual 8x8 block to a 1x64 vector. 2.3.1 The Basic Algorithm ZigZag-Permutation Algorithm consists of three steps: 1.

Reference-contexts: The experimental results confirm the calculated gain of 47%. Our results are shown in Table 6. We compared our results with the implementation of IDEA flfl . The gain is slightly larger than 47%, which could be explained by the overhead of IDEA implementation in PGP <ref> [11] </ref> software. 4.5 Pure Permutation Algorithm Byte-wise permutation is very fast. It takes less than 1ms for a typical I frame. Comparing to the regular playback time of 33ms/f, 1ms can be ignored.
