Title: ULTRA-LOW-POWER DOMAIN-SPECIFIC MULTIMEDIA PROCESSORS  
Author: Arthur Abnous and Jan Rabaey

Affiliation: Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences University of California,  
Abstract: Programmability is an important requirement for portable computing and communication devices that must be flexible enough to accommodate a variety of multimedia services and communication capabilities. However, compared to dedicated, application-specific solutions, programmable devices often incur significant performance and power penalties. We present a hybrid architecture template that can be used to implement ultra-low-power programmable processors for signal processing applications.

Reference-contexts: The increasing levels of integration and performance that are required for future single-chip, full-function multimedia processing devices will be accompanied by increasing levels of power dissipation <ref> [1] </ref>. Without significant advances in energy-efficient design techniques and architectures, battery life and system cost constraints will limit the capabilities of portable multimedia devices. An important requirement for advanced portable computing and communication devices is programmability.

Reference-contexts: For example, the processing core of the TMS320C5x family of general-purpose DSPs from Texas Instruments draws a total current of 55 mA from a 5V supply when executing a typical DSP application program with a 20% mix of multiply-accumulate operations <ref> [2] </ref>. Instruction fetching and decoding is responsible for 42 mA, i.e., 76%, of the total supply current. Clearly, a heavy penalty is paid for performing computations on a general-purpose datapath under the control of an instruction stream. The flexibility of general-purpose processors is highly desirable for handling general computing tasks.

Reference-contexts: VSELP Case Study To evaluate the potential impact of executing the dominant computational kernels of signal processing algorithms on dedicated, optimized processing elements, we have done an analysis of the VSELP Speech coder <ref> [3] </ref>. The goal of the analysis was to evaluate the computational complexity of the algorithm and to identify the dominant kernels of the algorithm that are responsible for a large fraction of the execution time and energy of the algorithm. This analysis also establishes a lower bound for energy consumption.

Reference-contexts: This analysis also establishes a lower bound for energy consumption. First, the dynamic execution profile of the algorithm is extracted. This information is then post-processed to produce a dynamic operation count, which is then fed into a high-level power analysis tool <ref> [4] </ref>. The result of this analysis is a power dissipation profile of the algorithm. Figure 2 shows the energy profile for the arithmetic operations of the VSELP speech coder for actual voice data.

Reference-contexts: Energy-Efficient Design Techniques Previous research in the area of low-power design has led to a number of important architectural techniques that have been applied successfully to implement application-specific devices for signal processing applications <ref> [5] </ref>. One of the most effective ways of reducing the energy consumption of a circuit is to reduce the supply voltage because the energy of a switching event drops quadratically with the supply voltage.

Reference-contexts: Each arc in the dataflow graph is assigned a dedicated link in the communication network. This ensures that all temporal correlations in a given stream of data are preserved and the amount of switching activity is minimized. Algorithms in a given domain of applications, e.g., CELP-based speech coders <ref> [6] </ref>, share a common set of operations, e.g., LPC analysis, synthesis filter, codebook search. When and how these operations are applied depends on the particular algorithm and is managed by the control processor.

Reference-contexts: This suggests a data-driven scheme for coordinating computation and communication activities across the system <ref> [7] </ref>, whereby all activities are synchronized by passing data tokens. This scheme is distributed, and compared to a traditional centralized control scheme, it is highly modular and scalable and provides for the graceful synchronization of a large number of processing elements.

Reference-contexts: An asynchronous scheme provides a high degree of flexibility and scalability, while avoiding the energy overhead of distributing and managing a global clock. This overhead can be as high as 28% of total power dissipation for some high-performance designs <ref> [8] </ref>. Asynchronous communication requires a proper handshaking protocol. An efficient signalling scheme is shown in Figure 6. A single wire is used alternately by the sender and receiver of a data token.

Reference-contexts: A single wire is used alternately by the sender and receiver of a data token. This scheme combines the efficiency of a conventional two-phase protocol (high throughput and minimum number of transitions) with the desirable return-to-zero characteristic of the conventional four-phase protocol <ref> [9] </ref>. For a given processor, a fully asynchronous implementation might not be the most efficient as it requires the overhead of generating completion signals. Thus, it might be more efficient to use traditional synchronous design methodologies for implementing individual satellite processors.

Reference-contexts: If the logic block is pipelined however, and can accept additional data tokens after the clock generator has started running, then the potential for metastability exists. Value-safe operation can be ensured by detecting metastable conditions and stretching the period of the local clock signal accordingly <ref> [10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Currently, the most energy-efficient signal processor for speech coding algorithms is the processor from Mitsubishi <ref> [11] </ref> which dissipates 36 mW (V dd = 1:8 V, 0.5-m CMOS technology) for the Japanese half-rate speech coding standard, which requires 23.4 MOPS on that processor (VSELP requires 7.8 MOPS).
