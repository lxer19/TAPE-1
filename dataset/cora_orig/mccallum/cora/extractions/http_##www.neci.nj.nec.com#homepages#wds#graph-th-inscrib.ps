Abstract: We present new graph-theoretical conditions for polyhedra of inscribable type and De-launay triangulations. We establish several sufficient conditions of the following general form: if a polyhedron has a sufficiently rich collection of Hamiltonian subgraphs, then it is of inscribable type. These results have several consequences: We also strengthen some earlier results about matchings in polyhedra of inscribable type. Specifically, we show that any nonbipartite polyhedron of inscribable type has a perfect matching containing any specified edge, and that any bipartite polyhedron of inscribable type has a perfect matching containing any two specified disjoint edges. We give examples showing that these results are best possible.

Reference-contexts: If DT (S) is nondegenerate, it is called the Delaunay triangulation. Elementary properties of the Delaunay tessellation/triangulation, and the more conventional definition as the dual of the Voronoi diagram, are developed in <ref> [1, 13, 23] </ref>. We call a triangulation Delaunay realizable if it is combinatorially equivalent to a Delaunay triangulation. A graph G is polyhedral if it can be realized as the edges and vertices of the convex hull of a noncoplanar set of points in 3-space (a polyhedron).

Reference-contexts: In particular, we show that a nonbipartite polyhedron of inscribable type has a perfect matching containing any given edge, and a bipartite polyhedron of inscribable type has a perfect matching containing any two given disjoint edges. 2 Preliminaries Except as noted, we use the graph-theoretical notation and definitions of <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This and other terms used in the introduction are defined in Section 2. 1 I (fvg) and N (fvg), respectively. jSj denotes the cardinality of a set S, and deg (v) = jN (v)j denotes the degree of a vertex v. A graph G is 1-tough <ref> [5] </ref> if for all nonempty S V (G), c (G S) jSj. (Here c () denotes the number of connected components.) G is 1-supertough if, for all S V (G) with jSj 2, c (G S) &lt; jSj. A Hamiltonian cycle in a graph is a spanning cycle. <p> Theorem 4.1 says that if G is of inscribable type, removing any vertex from G yields a 1-tough graph. It is well known that any Hamiltonian graph is 1-tough <ref> [5] </ref>. Lemma 2.2 suggests an alternative formulation of these two theorems. Let G be any triangulation with n vertices, and let G 0 be the simplicial planar graph obtained by stellating the outer face of G.

Reference-contexts: It was observed in <ref> [7] </ref> that any Hamiltonian polyhedral graph can be inscribed in a certain highly degenerate fashion: the graph can be realized as a polyhedron, "flattened" to a disk, with all the vertices lying on a common circle in an order determined by the Hamiltonian cycle.

Reference-contexts: The results of Section 3 indicate that this relationship is rather strong. Nevertheless, there are limits to the extent of the relationship. In particular, it is an NP-complete problem to determine whether a polyhedron of inscribable type (or a Delaunay triangulation) is Hamiltonian <ref> [10] </ref>. We close with three open problems: 1. The methods of Section 3 are, in principle, constructive. In particular, a weighting of a 4-connected polyhedron satisfying conditions (W1)-(W3) can be found in quadratic time by repeatedly using algorithms from [4].

Reference-contexts: Lemma 2.2 A plane graph G is realizable as DT (S) for some set S, with f as the unbounded face, if and only if the graph G 0 obtained from G by stellating f is of inscribable type. The following theorem, which is proved in <ref> [11] </ref>, characterizes the circumstances in which adding edges to graphs of inscribable type preserves inscribability. Here and throughout the paper, we assume that all bipartite graphs are 2-colored red and blue. Theorem 2.3 ([11]) Let G be a graph of inscribable type.

Reference-contexts: Rivin [24] has provided a numerical characterization of polyhedra of inscribable type as those polyhedra that admit a certain type of weighting (Theorem 2.1, below). Dillencourt and Smith have provided a graph-theoretical characterization of trivalent polyhedra of inscribable type, and a linear-time algorithm for recognizing them <ref> [12] </ref>. Nevertheless, a general graph-theoretical characterization has remained elusive. Examples given in [12] illustrate some of the subtleties involved. In the present paper, we establish graph-theoretical conditions for inscribability and Delaunay realizability that considerably narrow the gap between the most general sufficient conditions and the strongest necessary conditions. <p> Dillencourt and Smith have provided a graph-theoretical characterization of trivalent polyhedra of inscribable type, and a linear-time algorithm for recognizing them <ref> [12] </ref>. Nevertheless, a general graph-theoretical characterization has remained elusive. Examples given in [12] illustrate some of the subtleties involved. In the present paper, we establish graph-theoretical conditions for inscribability and Delaunay realizability that considerably narrow the gap between the most general sufficient conditions and the strongest necessary conditions. In Section 3 of this paper, we establish several sufficient conditions. <p> The second assertion follows from Theorem 3.1 and the Thomas-Yu result that all 4-connected planar graphs are 2-Hamiltonian. We note that a 4-connected graph need not be of circumscribable type. Examples are given in <ref> [12] </ref>. Our next goal is to show that any triangulation without chords or separating triangles is realizable as a Delaunay triangulation (Theorem 3.6). (A chord is an edge connecting two nonconsecutive vertices on the outer face, and a separating triangle is a nonfacial triangle). <p> Such a graph is easily seen to be 1-Hamiltonian. The "string-of-pearls" graphs introduced in the proof of Theorem 3.9 are not 4-connected, but their duals are bipartite and trivalent. It follows from <ref> [12, Theorem 3.1] </ref> that they are not of circumscribable type. So Theorem 3.9 is false if we replace "inscrib able" with "circumscribable". However, we have: Corollary 3.10 Every simplicial polyhedron in which every vertex has degree 5 or 6 is of both inscribable and circumscribable type. <p> Proof Inscribability is a special case of Theorem 3.9. It follows from the proof of Theorem 3.9 that if G is a simplicial polyhedron in which every vertex has degree 5 or 6, then G is 4-connected. It is observed in <ref> [12] </ref> that any trivalent polyhedron with a 4-connected dual is of inscribable type (proof: assign each edge a weight of 1/3). This observation implies that G has a dual of inscribable type, so G is of circumscribable type. 9 4 Necessary conditions The following theorem is proved in [12]. <p> observed in <ref> [12] </ref> that any trivalent polyhedron with a 4-connected dual is of inscribable type (proof: assign each edge a weight of 1/3).

Reference-contexts: A graph G is polyhedral if it can be realized as the edges and vertices of the convex hull of a noncoplanar set of points in 3-space (a polyhedron). A famous theorem of Steinitz (see <ref> [16] </ref>) asserts that a graph is polyhedral if and only if it is 3-connected and planar. A polyhedron is trivalent if all its vertices have degree 3, simplicial if all its faces are triangles. A polyhedron is trivalent if and only if its dual is simplicial. <p> Such a realization is called an inscription. Similarly, a polyhedron is of circumscribable type if it has a (combinatorially equivalent) realization as a polyhedron each of whose faces is tangent to a common sphere, and such a realization is called a circumscription. It is shown in <ref> [16] </ref> that a polyhedron is of circumscribable type if and only if its dual is of inscribable type. We will say that a graph is of inscribable (respectively, circumscribable) type if it is polyhedral and if any polyhedron realizing the graph is of inscribable (respectively, circumscribable) type. <p> Theorem 3.3 Any 4-connected planar graph, and any 4-connected planar graph with 1 vertex removed, is of inscribable type. 2 The fact that the stellated tetrahedron is not of inscribable type follows immediately from Theorem 3, page 286 of <ref> [16] </ref> or from Theorem 4.1, below. 4 (a) (b) This graph is 1-Hamiltonian and has a Hamiltonian cycle passing through every edge, but it is not Delaunay realizable. Proof The first assertion follows immediately from Theorem 3.1 and Nelson's theorem that all 4-connected planar graphs are 1-Hamiltonian.

Reference-contexts: For example, the graphs used to establish an upper bound of log 3 2 on the shortness exponent of simplicial polyhedra in [19] are exactly the same as the graphs used to establish the same upper bound on the noninscribability exponent of simplicial polyhedra in <ref> [17] </ref>. It was observed in [7] that any Hamiltonian polyhedral graph can be inscribed in a certain highly degenerate fashion: the graph can be realized as a polyhedron, "flattened" to a disk, with all the vertices lying on a common circle in an order determined by the Hamiltonian cycle.

Reference-contexts: A k-Hamiltonian graph is (k + 2)-connected. A famous theorem of Tutte [32, 33] asserts that any 4-connected planar graph is Hamiltonian, and that there is a Hamiltonian cycle passing through any two given edges incident on a common face. A refinement due to Nelson (see <ref> [30] </ref>) says that any 4-connected planar graph is 1-Hamiltonian. Recently, Thomas and Yu have extended this result by showing that any 4-connected planar graph is 2-Hamiltonian [28]. A triangulation is a 2-connected plane graph in which all faces except possibly the outer face are bounded by triangles.

Reference-contexts: A perfect matching in an n-vertex graph is a set of bn=2c disjoint edges, where bc denotes the "floor" function. We first state without proof the following lemma, taken from [9], which is an immediate consequence of Tutte's famous characterization of a 1-factor <ref> [31] </ref>: Lemma 4.2 Let G be a graph, and suppose that for each P V (G), c o (G P ) jP j + 1 (4:1) where c o (G P ) is the number of components of G P that have odd cardinality. Then G has a perfect matching.
