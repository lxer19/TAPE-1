Abstract: We propose to implement a two-dimensional version of the work described in Karl Simss 1994 SIGGRAPH Proceedings paper Evolving Virtual Creatures. [SIMSa] We will investigate goal-directed genetic algorithms and the dynamics of complex rigid bodies. Our application will generate animations of virtual creatures exhibiting evolved behaviors. The user will specify the characteristics of the environment in which two-dimensional creatures will evolve. An initial random set of creatures will be created and simulated, and those that are successful at specified behaviors will be selected for breeding. Goal behaviors will include jumping, walking, and swimming. Once the program has bred several generations of creatures, survivors may be saved for future examination. Motivation. One of the great attractions of software development is the outlet for creativity. Genetic algorithms provide an especially effective outlet by adding unpredictable elements that make the creative process interactive and the results surprising. In addition, articulated rigid body dynamics are used throughout computer animation, making it a useful topic of study for students interested in interactive graphics and animation. Finally, by combining genetic algorithms, articulated rigid body dynamics, and computer graphics it is possible to model and simulate creations that would be difficult to invent and impossible to encounter in everyday life. Functional Description. The user will begin by specifying system parameters such as initial population size, number of generations to evolve, mutation rates, and breeding methods. The application will generate an initial random set of creatures and then simulate each creature in the specified environment. After simulation, creatures will be selected for breeding based on performance. The parent and
