Abstract: We describe the mathematical software package SimplicialVIEW, which uses efficient geometric algorithms for computing an approximate stability crossover region in the uncertainty space of a feedback control system, from which the robustness margin of the feedback control system is obtained. This package is the materialization of our research in simplicially approximated Nyquist maps and visualization of the crossover region as an assembly of simplexes. We use the simplicial approximation theorem of algebraic topology to develop the theoretical foundation, and put it into practice using highly optimized computational geometry algorithms. The SimplicialVIEW graphical user interface ( GUI ) is presented and some control examples are discussed.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction SimplicialVIEW is a mathematical software package, written in C/C++, for the computation of an approximate solution to the stability crossover problem in the uncertainty space of a feedback control system, from which the robustness margin of the feedback control system is obtained <ref> [1] </ref>. SimplicialVIEW can also be used to fine tune the parameters of the compensator for best robustness properties. The program works on SUN SPARCstations and HP machines with X Window and Motif, and runs to about 42,000 lines of source code at this stage. The paper is organized as follows. <p> (L) = (inffk 2 R + : det (I + kL (j!)(q)) = 0; for some ! 2 R; kq i k 1g) 1 This defines the complex (real, resp.) -function if the q i 's are running in the closed unit disk D of the complex plane (the interval <ref> [1; +1] </ref> of the real line, resp.). Clearly the feedback remains stable 8k &lt; 1 ; 8kq i k 1. It turns out that the real function is not continuous relative to "certain" parameters lumped in L (s); see [14],[12]. <p> One of the premises of this paper is that we have to go back to the geometric foundation of the problem to elucidate these phenomena. Let D = fg be the (structured) topological space of all uncertain parameters. For example, D = D n (D = <ref> [1; +1] </ref> n ) for the complex (real, resp.) function. In the phase margin problem, D = U (n), D = SU (2; C) = S 3 or D = T n , depending on the formulation [6].

Reference-contexts: An approximation of the crossover is given by the two dark triangles lo cated on the x-axis ( dark horizontal line ). 6.2 A Benchmark problem for Robust Control Design Consider the benchmark problem proposed by Wie and Bernstein <ref> [3] </ref>. The undamped spring-mass system has the following transfer function: z = m 1 s 2 (m 2 s 2 + (1 + m 1 (2) where the masses m 1 and m 2 and spring constant k are uncertain and each has a nominal value of 1:0.

Reference-contexts: The objective ( design #2 ) is to design a controller with maximum multivariable stability margin and that also satisfies the 15-s settling time requirement. We used the controller designed by Chiang and Safonov <ref> [4] </ref> and performed a robust stability analysis using SimplicialVIEW. Note that Dfi is a 4-D space ( 3 uncertain parameters plus the frequency ), and we have orthogonally projected Dfi along the axis to obtain the 3-D Q-triangulation of the space of uncertainties D ( see figure 5 ). <p> SimplicialVIEW gives a maximum k m value of 43:37% for all uncertain parameters. The estimated maximum k m value computed using the k m -synthesis framework <ref> [4] </ref> is 42%, and is guaranteed to be a tight conservative lower bound. As we can see, SimplicialVIEW obtained a slightly more accurate k m value estimate, confirming the correctness of the simplicial techniques used. surface, with 5024 tetrahedra.

Reference-contexts: Next we subdivide star (a 0 i a 0 ), . . . , until a completely labelled simplex, that is a simplex mapped to b 0 b 1 b 2 , is identified, from which we lock on the crossover using the Hex game algorithm <ref> [5] </ref> . It is easily seen that this latter procedure alleviate the computational burden by making the map simplicial only around the crossover. 4.3 Numerical Stability Numerical stability of geometric algorithms ( "robust geometric computation" ) is not yet very mature.

Reference-contexts: For example, D = D n (D = [1; +1] n ) for the complex (real, resp.) function. In the phase margin problem, D = U (n), D = SU (2; C) = S 3 or D = T n , depending on the formulation <ref> [6] </ref>. In the simplest possible case of real parameters without any other a priori knowledge, D = R fi R fi :::. If we allow the uncertain parameters to run in R, clearly, the feedback is not likely to sustain stability for all parameters.

Reference-contexts: In order to efficiently compute the Voronoi diagram and the Delauney triangulation for n sites (b 0 ; b 1 ; :::; b n1 ) in the complex plane, the sweepline algorithm presented in <ref> [9] </ref> was chosen, which gives an optimal O (n log n) worst-case time complexity using O (n) memory space. As far as numerical stability is concerned, the sweepline algorithm used in the sim-plicial software is a robust algorithm with respect to round off errors during the computations [13].

Reference-contexts: In general, a continuous map is not simplicial. To overcome this problem we make use of the simplicial approximation theorem: Theorem 3.2 <ref> [11] </ref> Given the continuous map f : D fi ! N , where D fi is assumed to be a polyhedron P ( Alexan-droff 's theorem ) and N is the polygonal Nyquist template, given a tolerance level *, there exist a refinement ~ P of the polyhedron P , a <p> Clearly, S j star (b j ) and S j f 1 (star (b j )) are open coverings of N and D fi , respectively. Let ffi be the Lebesgue number of the latter open covering <ref> [11] </ref>. If we subdivide the polyhedron D fi fine enough to have diameter (a 0 a 1 . . .) &lt; ffi=2 for any of its simplexes (a 0 a 1 . . .), then diameter (star (a i )) &lt; ffi; 8i.

Reference-contexts: It turns out that these singularity phenomena provide the explanation for some combinatorial pitfalls relevant to the emerging field of "robust geometric computations" for example, degeneracy of the Voronoi diagram of the template near the critical val ues <ref> [13] </ref>, difficulty to make the Nyquist map simplicial around the critical curves of D fi , etc. 3 The Simplicial Approxima tion Theorem In order to motivate the simplicial approximation theorem, it is convenient to proceed from a problem related to, but different from, crossover computation. <p> As far as numerical stability is concerned, the sweepline algorithm used in the sim-plicial software is a robust algorithm with respect to round off errors during the computations <ref> [13] </ref>.

We ran the Barmich et al counterexample through this analysis <ref> [14] </ref>, and we indeed found out that, at the precise value of the "certain" parameter where the suddenly jumps, a critical value curve crosses over 0 + j0.
