Abstract: This paper presents the candidate/critique model of interactive problem solving, in which an automated problem solver communicates candidate solutions to the user and the user critiques those solutions. The system starts with minimal information about the users preferences, and preferences are elicited and inferred incrementally by analyzing the critiques. The systems goal is to present good candidates to the user, but to do so it must learn as much as possible about his preferences in order to improve its choice of candidates in subsequent iterations. This system contrasts with traditional decision-analytic and planning frameworks in which a complete model is elicited beforehand or is constructed by a human expert. The paper presents the Automated Travel Assistant , an implemented prototype of the model that interactively builds flight itineraries using real-time airline information. The ATA is available on the World Wide Web and has had over

Reference-contexts: Unlike our work, TRAINS does not focus on eliciting a complex model of the users preferences to guide the search through a large solution space but instead focuses on collaboratively repairing a single solution to the given problem. In Globe-Trotter <ref> ( Bose, Biaswas, and Padala, 1989) </ref>, the travel planner generates an interaction between the system and the user, attempting to emulate the interaction with a real travel agent. Expressed user preferences are progressively refined as the system provides information and the user modifies his profile.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Building an accurate user model is essential to decision making and decisionsupport tasks; a model of the user's preferences is required to make good decisions or to suggest good alternatives. Representations for preference models have been studied extensively in the literature on multi-attribute utility theory <ref> (e.g. Keeney and Raiffa, 1976) </ref>, which provides compact representations and elicitation techniques for preference models, but generally assumes that the model is built by a human expert. <p> Values in the open interval represent partial satisfaction of the constraint. An assumption we make that is not inherent to the candidate/critique model, but does make the problem more tractable, is that the preferences are additive independent <ref> ( Keeney and Raiffa, 1976) </ref>, meaning that preferences over the individual attributes do not depend on the level at which the other attributes are achieved.
