Abstract: The relative merits of the wavelet-Galerkin solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations, typical of geophysical problems, are quantitatively and qualitatively compared to traditional finite difference and Fourier-pseudo-spectral methods. The wavelet-Galerkin solution presented here is found to be a viable alternative to the two conventional techniques.

Reference-contexts: In our estimation, the usefulness of wavelets in the solution of differential equations is still a matter to be completely established. This study sheds some light on the practical use of wavelets in the solution of hyperbolic equations. Recent developments in wavelet techniques <ref> [1] </ref> have made the wavelet Galerkin procedure a viable option for the solution of some classes of partial differential equations. In this 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 65N30, 65N13, 65F10. Key words and phrases. wavelets, Galerkin, hyperbolic, nonlinear, dispersive, finite difference, Fourier pseudo spectral. <p> This system was chosen because it has many of the ingredients of hyperbolic equations that arise in geophysical problems.
