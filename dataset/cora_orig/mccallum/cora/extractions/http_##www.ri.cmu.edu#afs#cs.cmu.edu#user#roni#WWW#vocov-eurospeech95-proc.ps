Title: Optimizing Lexical and N-gram Coverage Via Judicious Use of Linguistic Data

Abstract: I study the effect of various types and amounts of North American Business language data on the quality of the derived vocabulary, and use my findings to derive an improved ranking of the words, using only 19% of the NAB corpus. I then study the conflicting effects of increased vocabulary size on a speech recognizer's accuracy, and use the result to pick an optimal vocabulary size. A similar analysis of ngram coverage yields a very different outcome, with the best system being the one based on the most data.

Reference-contexts: Viewed this way, the problem becomes one of estimating unigram probabilities of the test distribution, and then ordering the words by these estimates. The test set consisted of 1.4M words worth of North American Business news. The training data was the 227M-word NAB corpus (see <ref> [Roseneld 95] </ref> for details). In all studies, except where otherwise noted, the word list was ordered by decreasing frequency in the appropriate subset of the training data.
