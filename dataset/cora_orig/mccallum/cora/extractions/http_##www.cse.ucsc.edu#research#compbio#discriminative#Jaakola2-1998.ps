Abstract: A new method for detecting remote protein homologies is introduced and shown to perform well in classifying protein domains by SCOP superfamily. The method is a variant of support vector machines using a new kernel function. The kernel function is derived from a generative statistical model for a protein family, in this case a hidden Markov model. This general approach of combining generative models like HMMs with discriminative methods such as support vector machines may have applications in other areas of biosequence analysis as well.

A positive value of the likelihood ratio L (X) is taken as an indication that the new sequence X is indeed a member of the family. <p> While this decision rule is perfectly reasonable, and in fact optimal, when both the model H 1 and the null model H 0 are completely accurate, it can perform poorly when these models are not accurate. This can easily happen with limited training sets <ref> [Barrett et al., 1997, Park et al., 1998] </ref>. This problem is made worse by the objective function typically used in estimating the parameters for the generative models, P (XjH 1 ) and possibly also P (XjH 0 ).

Reference-contexts: scores from all pairwise comparisons between a query protein and the members of a known protein family are combined to improve performance [Grundy, 1998]. 2 Methods The statistical modeling approach to protein sequence analysis involves constructing a generative probability model, such as an HMM, for a protein family or superfamily <ref> [Durbin et al., 1998] </ref>. Sequences known to be members of the protein family are used as (positive) training examples, and the parameters of a statistical model representing the family are estimated using these training examples, in conjunction with general a priori information about properties of proteins. <p> Suppose that we are interested in a particular protein family such as immunoglobulins and have estimated an HMM H 1 for this family (for details of the estimation process see, e.g., <ref> [Durbin et al., 1998] </ref>). We use P (XjH 1 ) to denote the corresponding probability model.

Reference-contexts: We then use a general 1 discriminative statistical method to classify the points representing protein sequences by domain superfamily. This is quite distinct from methods that train the parameters of the HMM itself to give a more discriminative model <ref> [Eddy et al., 1995, Mamitsuka, 1996] </ref>. Using this method, we obtain a substantial improvement in identifying remote homologies over what is achieved by HMMs alone, as they are currently employed.

In <ref> [Grundy, 1998] </ref>, a related combination rule, which instead used the average of the BLAST bit scores, was 10 suggested. We tried a similar average method, taking the average of the log E-values, which should in theory be more accurate than averaging the bit scores. <p> All the methods considered in this paper combine multiple scores for each query sequence. The multiple scores arise either from several models that are available for a particular superfamily (HMM and SVM-Fisher) or because each known sequence can be scored against the query sequence (BLAST, see <ref> [Grundy, 1998] </ref>). The simple combination rules employed in this paper for each method are not necessarily optimal and further work needs to be done in this regard.

The simple combination rules employed in this paper for each method are not necessarily optimal and further work needs to be done in this regard. It should be noted that while our methods for combining BLAST and HMM scores are essentially the same as those explored in [Grundy, 1998], the relative performance of the simple generative HMM method versus the family pairwise search homology methods using BLAST is reversed in our experiments: here the HMM performs better. <p> This is not surprising, since our tests consisted of finding very remote homologies for the most part, whereas the tests in <ref> [Grundy, 1998] </ref> were for finding sequences that were mostly in the same family as the training sequences.

Reference-contexts: We have, however, developed a general formalism for deriving kernel functions from generative probability models (see <ref> [Jaakkola & Haussler, 1998] </ref>). This formalism carries several advantages, including the ability to handle complex objects such as variable length protein sequences within the kernel function. Furthermore, the formalism facilitates the encoding of prior knowledge about protein sequences, via the probability models, into the kernel function. <p> Also, unlike the simple likelihood score, it provides the means for comparing two sequences relative to a single model.

Reference-contexts: The use of the domain database allows for accurate determination of a sequence's class, eliminating the ambiguity associated with searching whole-chain protein databases. The generative models were obtained from an existing library of SAM-T98 HMMs. The SAM-T98 algorithm, described more fully in <ref> [Karplus et al., 1998] </ref>, builds an HMM for a SCOP domain sequence by searching the non-redundant protein database NRP for a set of potential homologs of the sequence and then iteratively selecting positive training sequences from among these potential homologs and refining a model. <p> However, the maximum method performed best, so we report results for that combination method only. 3.5 Generative HMM Scores Finally, we also report results using the SAM-T98 method as a purely generative model.

We used the same data and the same set of models as in the SVM-Fisher score experiments; we just replaced the SVM-Fisher score with the SAM-T98 score.

Reference-contexts: We then use a general 1 discriminative statistical method to classify the points representing protein sequences by domain superfamily. This is quite distinct from methods that train the parameters of the HMM itself to give a more discriminative model <ref> [Eddy et al., 1995, Mamitsuka, 1996] </ref>. Using this method, we obtain a substantial improvement in identifying remote homologies over what is achieved by HMMs alone, as they are currently employed.

Reference-contexts: Many statistical, sequence-based tools have been developed for detecting protein homologies. These include BLAST [Altshul et al., 1990, Altschul et al., 1997], Fasta [Pearson & Lipman, 1988], PROBE <ref> [Neuwald et al., 1997] </ref>, templates (e.g. [Taylor, 1986]), profiles (e.g. [Gribskov et al., 1987]), position-specific weight matrices (e.g. [Henikoff & Henikoff, 1994]), and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (e.g. [Krogh et al., 1994]).

Reference-contexts: Recent experiments <ref> [Brenner, 1996, Park et al., 1998] </ref> have used the SCOP classification of protein structures [Hubbard et al., 1997] to test many of these methods to see how well they detect remote protein homologies that exist between protein domains that are in the same structural superfamily, but not necessarily in the same <p> )P (H 1 ) = log P (XjH 0 ) P (H 1 ) (1) where the null model P (XjH 0 ) is the probability model under the hypothesis that the sequence X does not belong to the family of interest; different types of null models are discussed in <ref> [Barrett et al., 1997, Park et al., 1998] </ref>. A positive value of the likelihood ratio L (X) is taken as an indication that the new sequence X is indeed a member of the family. <p> While this decision rule is perfectly reasonable, and in fact optimal, when both the model H 1 and the null model H 0 are completely accurate, it can perform poorly when these models are not accurate. This can easily happen with limited training sets <ref> [Barrett et al., 1997, Park et al., 1998] </ref>. This problem is made worse by the objective function typically used in estimating the parameters for the generative models, P (XjH 1 ) and possibly also P (XjH 0 ). <p> However, the maximum method performed best, so we report results for that combination method only. 3.5 Generative HMM Scores Finally, we also report results using the SAM-T98 method as a purely generative model. The null model used here is the reverse sequence model from <ref> [Park et al., 1998, Karplus et al., 1998] </ref>. We used the same data and the same set of models as in the SVM-Fisher score experiments; we just replaced the SVM-Fisher score with the SAM-T98 score. <p> Since the numeric scores produced by each method are not directly comparable, we use the rate of false positives (RFP) achieved for each positive test sequence as metric for comparing methods <ref> [Park et al., 1998] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: To compute the likelihood score for a query sequence X or, equivalently, to evaluate P (XjH 1 ; ), we employ the standard forward-backward algorithm <ref> [Rabiner & Juang, 1986] </ref>. In addition to obtaining the generative likelihood for the query sequence, the forward-backward algorithm extracts what are known as sufficient statistics for the parameters. The vector of sufficient statistics is of fixed length, containing a value for each parameter in the HMM.
