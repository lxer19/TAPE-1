Title: A Computational Model of Tractable Reasoning taking inspiration from cognition  
Author: Lokendra Shastri

Affiliation: Department of Computer Information Science University of Pennsylvania  
Abstract: Polynomial time complexity is the usual `threshold' for distinguishing the tractable from the intractable and it may seem reasonable to adopt this notion of tractability in the context of knowledge representation and reasoning. It is argued that doing so may be inappropriate in the context of common sense reasoning underlying language understanding. A more stringent criteria of tractability is proposed. A result about reasoning that is tractable in this stronger sense is outlined. Some unusual properties of tractable reasoning emerge when the formal specification is grounded in a neurally plausible architecture.

Reference-contexts: neurally motivated model of tractable reasoning We have proposed a neurally plausible model (SHRUTI) that can encode a LTKB of the type described above, together with a term hierarchy and perform a class of forward as well as backward reasoning with extreme efficiency [ Shastri and Ajjanagadde, 1990 ] ; <ref> [ Ajjanagadde and Shastri, 1991 ] </ref> ; [ Mani and Shastri, 1991 ] ; [ Mani and Shastri, 1992 ] ; [ Shastri, 1992 ] . SHRUTI can draw inferences in time that is only proportional to the depth of the shallowest derivation leading to the conclusion.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Understanding language is a complex task. It involves among other things, carrying out inferences in order to establish referential and causal coherence, generate expectations, and make predictions. Nevertheless we can understand language at the rate of several hundred words per minute <ref> [ Carpenter and Just, 1977 ] </ref> . This rapid rate of language understanding suggests that we can (and do) perform a wide range of inferences very rapidly, automatically and without conscious effort | as though they are a reflex response of our cognitive apparatus.

Reference-contexts: This assumes that the correspondence (specified by the rules in the LTKB) between the arguments of the antecedent and consequent predicates are hard-wired. It can be shown that the propagation of argument bindings from multiple predicates to a predicate can be carried out in parallel (see <ref> [ Mani and Shastri, 1992 ] </ref> for a possible implementation of such a parallel binding propagation scheme). This means that the time required to carry out one step of a parallel breadth-first derivation is only proportional to V jInj V . <p> that can encode a LTKB of the type described above, together with a term hierarchy and perform a class of forward as well as backward reasoning with extreme efficiency [ Shastri and Ajjanagadde, 1990 ] ; [ Ajjanagadde and Shastri, 1991 ] ; [ Mani and Shastri, 1991 ] ; <ref> [ Mani and Shastri, 1992 ] </ref> ; [ Shastri, 1992 ] .

Reference-contexts: It may be significant that the bound on the number of entities that may be referenced by the active facts during a derivation relates well to 7 2, the robust measure of short-term memory capacity <ref> [ Miller, 1956 ] </ref> . Note however, that SHRUTI does not place a small limit on the number of facts that can be simultaneously active | indeed a very large number of facts can be involved in each derivation carried out by SHRUTI. 2.
