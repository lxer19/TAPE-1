Abstract: Uniformity tests based on a discrete form of entropy are introduced and studied in the context of empirical testing of uniform random number generators. Comparisons are made with tests based on the Pearson chi-square statistic. Numerical results are provided and several currently used generators fail the tests. The linear congruential and nonlinear inversive generators with power-of-two modulus perform especially badly. Authors' Addresses: P. L'Ecuyer and J.-F.

The GFSR generators are known to have important weaknesses, such as poor bit-mixing properties <ref> [4, 28, 29] </ref>, but these defects do not always show up in the entropy tests. The linear congruential generators with prime moduli considered here fail other tests [21, 26, 39], and would also fail the entropy tests with larger sample sizes than those considered in this paper. <p> Of course, all generators eventually fail if one increases the sample size indefinitely, because they have finite period length and because of the conservation law for the total amount of correlation valid for all finite sequences <ref> [4] </ref>. But if the generator is well-designed and has long-enough period, a test may require a practically infeasible amount of computing time before failure occurs. Ideally, meaningful statistical tests should be sensitive to the weaknesses that are regarded most harmful in arbitrary applications.

Reference-contexts: To estimate these errors we used the generator G16 defined in Section 5.1. So far, this generator has been extremely reliable in all our experiments. We also double checked with other generators of different types, including G15 and the combined Tausworthe generator proposed in <ref> [24] </ref>, and the results agreed. These results also agree with the theory. 3.4 Correlation between successive entropy values A second type of test of H 0 verifies whether the pairs (H i ; H i+1 ), for 1 i N 1, are significantly correlated.

The GFSR generators are known to have important weaknesses, such as poor bit-mixing properties <ref> [4, 28, 29] </ref>, but these defects do not always show up in the entropy tests. The linear congruential generators with prime moduli considered here fail other tests [21, 26, 39], and would also fail the entropy tests with larger sample sizes than those considered in this paper.

Reference-contexts: It turns out that H is equivalent (up to a linear transformation) to the loglikelihood ratio statistic G 2 for the multinomial distribution, whose theoretical properties have been studied at length since its introduction by Neyman and Pearson <ref> [30] </ref>. We summarize some properties of X 2 and G 2 . Section 3 explains how we extract bit strings of length L from the output sequence of a generator to apply entropy tests with k = 2 L .

Reference-contexts: Different statistical tests are sensitive to different types of deficiencies in generators, so it is useful to apply a wide range of tests. For background on random number generators and statistical testing, see for example <ref> [18, 21, 22, 27, 31] </ref>. Since by necessity all statistical tests are applied to subsequences of finite length, they can never exclude the possibility that in extensive applications, effects arise that escaped detection in testing.

Reference-contexts: Entropy tests are thus a useful addition to the toolbox. 2 Tests based on the entropy and on Pearson's statistic 2.1 Testing the equiprobable multinomial distribution We recall some facts about goodness-of-fit statistics for the multinomial distribution with equal probabilities. Cressie and Read <ref> [5, 35] </ref> have introduced the power divergence statistic which, in the case of the equiprobable hypothesis H 0 , is defined by 2nI () = (1 + ) j=0 2 n=k 1 5 ; (6) where is a real-valued parameter. <p> loglikelihood ratio statistic: G 2 = 2nI 0 = 2 j=0 The statistics G 2 and H are related by a simple linear transformation: H = log 2 (k) 2n ln (2) Under H 0 , when n ! 1 for fixed k (the fixed-cells case), it is known (see <ref> [35] </ref>) that 2nI () converges in distribution to a chi-square random variable with k 1 degrees of freedom. <p> General expressions for the asymptotic mean and variance are given in <ref> [35] </ref>, in terms of integrals involving Poisson random variables. The asymptotic mean and variance of 2nI () in the sparse case are different than in the fixed-cells case. <p> Read et Cressie <ref> [35] </ref> had good success with this type of ad-hoc procedure and recommend it. The moment-corrected statistics are X 2 X 2 (k 1)(1 oe X ) (13) H C = oe H where oe 2 X = 1 (k 1)=(2n) and oe 2 H = Var [H]=(2 (k 1)). <p> The mean and variance of H can be replaced by their approximations (11-12). A second possibility would be to correct the distribution itself, e.g., using Edgeworth-type expansions <ref> [35, p.68] </ref>. This gives extremely complicated expressions, due in part to the discrete nature of the multinomial distribution, and the gain is small. For large n and k, one would use the normal approximation, with the exact means and variances instead of the asymptotic ones, for better accuracy. <p> We recall some known facts for = 1 and = 0, i.e., X 2 and G 2 , keeping in mind that G 2 is equivalent to H. One can compare the two statistics in terms of their Pitman and Bahadur asymptotic efficiencies (see, e.g., <ref> [34, 35] </ref> for general definitions). <p> For Bahadur efficiency, on the other hand, one fixes c and examines the rate at which the significance level converges to one as n ! 1. Several authors have compared X 2 and G 2 in terms of Pitman and Bahadur efficiencies (see, e.g, <ref> [35] </ref>). In summary, ARE (X 2 ; G 2 ) = 1 when n=k ! 1 and ARE (X 2 ; G 2 ) &gt; 1 when n=k ! m where 0 &lt; m &lt; 1.

Reference-contexts: In [4], the notation and terminology were taken from statistical mechanics, while here the point of view is that of probability theory and statistics. Statistical tests based on the entropy of a continuous distribution have already been proposed and applied <ref> [6, 7, 14, 38] </ref>. These tests are based on (continuous) entropy estimators related to sums of logarithms of m-spacings, and have little in common with those proposed here. They are also discussed in [25].
