Abstract: In this paper, we present a theory of efficient search in GIS. By efficient search we mean to efficiently search for a given feature over a given spatial region or an information system, such as searching for a wildlife specie in a forest, searching for an oil field in a region, or searching for certain information in a GIS database. The task of Geo-information search is formulated as an optimization problem - maximizing the tendency of obtaining the information to be searched within a given effort constraint. Our formulation relates the search action (such as dig a well to find whether the region contains oil) with its effects (such as the action really find the oil field). We give a general action selection strategy that can determine which action should be applied when the number of actions that can be applied is restricted. We also give a strategy of how to integrate the result of the search action with our previous belief.

Reference-contexts: It ought to be possible to partition all of one's beliefs among the different subsets of fi, assigning to each subset A that portion which is committed to A and to nothing smaller. If fi is a frame of discernment, then a function m : 2 fi ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> (1) is called a basic probability assignment whenever m () = 0 (2) and X m (A) = 1 (3) The quantity m (A) is called A's basic belief assignment, and it is understood to be the measure of the belief that is committed exactly to A.
