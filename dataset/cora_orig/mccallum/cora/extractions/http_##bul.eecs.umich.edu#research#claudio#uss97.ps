Abstract: A quantitative analysis of a two-dimensional non-invasive real-time temperature-change estimation algorithm based on diagnostic backscattered ultrasound RF-data is presented in this paper. An experimental system consisting of a therapeutic ultrasound unit and an ultrasound imaging unit was used to quantitatively characterize the accuracy, spatial resolution and ripple artifacts of the temperature estimates in a rubber phantom heating experiment. The ripple is shown to be a consequence of the thermo-acoustic lens effect resulting from local changes of the speed of sound in heated regions. Non-invasive temperature estimates were used as inputs to a multipoint ultrasound phased array temperature controller, for a long duration hyperthermia experiment. The applicability of this method to tissue media, as well as its major limitations are discussed.

Reference-contexts: 1 Method The feasibility of two-dimensional real-time non-invasive temperature estimation using pulse-echo diagnostic ultrasound has been previously demonstrated <ref> [1] </ref>. The method is based on the detection of changes in the backscattered RF-echo that occur due to thermally induced local changes in the speed of sound and thermal expansion in the propagating medium.

Reference-contexts: The first step of the temperature estimation algorithm consists of estimating RF-echo time-shifts between successive frames and accumulating these time-shifts over all frames. The resulting cumulative time-shifts are then regularized, differentiated along the axial direction and scaled to obtain temperature estimates <ref> [2] </ref>. Spatial gradients in the temperature distribution constitute local aberrators to the ultrasound imaging system, due to the local change in speed of sound. <p> In the case of clinical applications, it may be necessary to provide the method with some information regarding the tissue local physical properties and geometry, if calibrated temperature estimates are desired. 5 Conclusion The non-invasive temperature estimation technique introduced in <ref> [2] </ref> was quantitatively characterized in this paper. Non-invasive temperature estimates were shown to be in good agreement with invasive thermocouple temperature measurements. It was shown that sharp lateral gradients in the temperature profile introduce ripple in the non-invasive temperature estimates behind these regions, due to a thermo-acoustic lens effect.

Reference-contexts: The design of this filter controls the tradeoff between the desired spatial resolution and the acceptable level of ripple in the temperature estimates <ref> [3] </ref>. 2 Experimental Setup The combined imaging/therapy ultrasound system shown in Fig. 1 was used in all of the experiments. Therapeutic System: A 1 MHz piezocomposite spherical shaped 64-element 1-D array transducer (Imasonic, France) was used to generate the therapeutic field. <p> Beamformed RF-data was collected from this device in real-time through a custom made VXI-compatible interface connected to a SUN Sparc 10, and processed to obtain the temperature estimates <ref> [3] </ref>. Phantom: A parallelepiped phantom (85 fi 70 fi 48 mm 3 ) was made of rubber material (plastic for making plastic worms, M-F Manufacturing Co., Fort Worth, TX) containing polystyrene scatterers. <p> The temperature increase created by the therapeutic beam constitutes a localized aberrator for the imaging system, due to the local change of speed of sound in the propagating medium <ref> [3] </ref>. To illustrate part of this phenomenon, let us consider the echo coming from a particular location behind the heated region (for example, lateral=15 mm, axial=43 mm, in Fig. 3, BBSF). <p> Consequently there is no significant ripple in the time-shift estimates behind the central part of the heated region. The above experiments are described in full detail in <ref> [3] </ref>. Application to Temperature Control: Non-invasive temperature estimates were used as feedback in a multipoint ultrasound phased array controller. Temperatures were controlled at 4 points along a lateral line, adjacent points being separated by 6 mm.

Reference-contexts: However, the receiver beamforming algorithm of the imaging system assumes the speed of sound in the medium to be constant, therefore does not compensate for the aberrator <ref> [4] </ref>. Consequently the beamformed RF-echo waveform behind the heated region is distorted when compared to the corresponding waveform prior to heating. This causes the RF-echoes behind the heated region (before and after heating) to decorrelate, introducing ripple in the time-shift estimates.

Reference-contexts: Small temperature rises due to all 5 heating patterns during the identification phase can be seen at the top of the image. These figures clearly show the effect of conduction and how the controller is capable of tracking the specified set-point values. The controller algorithm is fully described in <ref> [5] </ref>, and some preliminary experimental results are given in [6]. 4 Discussion Non-invasive temperature estimates obtained with this method were shown to be very accurate prior to and including the heated region.
