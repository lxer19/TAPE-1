Abstract: Good communication is vital in healthcare, both among healthcare professionals, and between healthcare professionals and their patients. And well-written documents, describing and/or explaining the information in structured databases may be easier to comprehend, more edifying and even more convincing, than the structured data, even when presented in tabular or graphic form. Documents may be automatically generated from structured data, using techniques from the field of natural language generation. These techniques are concerned with how the content, organisation and language used in a document can be dynamically selected, depending on the audience and context. They have been used to generate health education materials, explanations and critiques in decision support systems, and medical reports and progress notes.

Reference-contexts: In healthcare, the evident need to translate between textual forms (human authored texts) and structured information has led to a large and continually growing body of research and development in natural language understanding <ref> [1] </ref>. In this article we consider the reverse problem how textual documents may be produced from structured data.

Reference-contexts: from the same data, many different documents with different content, terminology and style, and thereby help meet diverse information needs within healthcare. 2 A Brief Overview of Natural Language Generation Natural language generation (NLG) is concerned with automatically generating texts in English (or other human languages) from computer-accessible data. (See <ref> [2] </ref> for a recent review. 1 ) NLG techniques range from the simplest report generation and mail merge systems 2 , to sophisticated discourse and dialogue generation systems that reason about the effect various forms and presentational structures will have on their recipients.

Reference-contexts: Simple mail merge techniques have been used in practice, as well as in various experiments on whether personalisation of material used in patient education <ref> [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] </ref> can increase its effectiveness. However, the problem with such techniques is that they are inflexible, allowing relatively little variation in the texts produced.

Reference-contexts: Simple IF-THEN statements often allow different chunks of text to be output depending on the current data. 2 Natural language generation may be divided into stages. One proposed division <ref> [8] </ref> is * Text planning: The basic content of the text is selected for the particular readership and organised coherently.

Reference-contexts: For many practical systems, only a limited amount of flexibility may be required for example, where the texts to be produced have a standard structure (e.g., SOAP notes <ref> [9] </ref>), and the process of content selection involves filling out this structure. <p> Here we briefly consider both where more advanced NLG techniques are likely to be worthwhile in practice, and which methods are likely to be most useful. Sometimes the costs of using advanced NLG techniques may outweigh the benefits <ref> [9] </ref>: For example, if using them requires authoring a special purpose knowledge base whose life-span is short, then unless the techniques allow one to serve a significantly larger population that one otherwise could, then simple techniques, such as those used in mail merge systems, may be adequate.

Reference-contexts: For a particular application we have to decide whether the additional flexibility we get from using the more sophisticated methods justifies the costs: the more sophisticated methods do require more work in setting up for a particular application <ref> [10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This will depend on the kind of flexibility required for that application. 3 Example Applications Within healthcare natural language generation techniques have been applied in a number of areas: generating explanations, advice and critiques in medical expert systems <ref> [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] </ref>; generating reports, briefings, progress notes and discharge letters for health professionals [19, 20, 21, 22, 23] and generating explanatory materials for patients [24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. <p> The explanations produced using these simple methods are far from ideal. However, improving them requires as a basis, a richer source of information a simple rule trace will often miss key information that should be included in order for an explanation to be convincing. Swartout <ref> [11] </ref> attempted to address this issue by looking at how the underlying rationale behind rules may be preserved and used in explanation. <p> In a compositional scheme, on the other hand, much can be achieved based on combining words from a relatively simple lexicon. 4 Discussion The above systems have used a wide range of natural language generation (NLG) techniques, from the very simple to the complex. Some have emphasised text planning <ref> [11, 12, 18, 24, 25, 26, 27] </ref>, others sentence planning [19, 21, 28] or realisation [13, 14, 59].

This is discussed by Moore [35] (although not for a medical domain). A simple example of independent text planning in a medical expert system is HF-EXPLAIN <ref> [12] </ref>, which generates explanations for a heart failure expert system based on a causal model. Rather than merely providing a trace of the causal processes, the system tries to follow the typical structure of human explanations in this domain by making use of simple schemata. <p> In a compositional scheme, on the other hand, much can be achieved based on combining words from a relatively simple lexicon. 4 Discussion The above systems have used a wide range of natural language generation (NLG) techniques, from the very simple to the complex.

Reference-contexts: flexibility required for that application. 3 Example Applications Within healthcare natural language generation techniques have been applied in a number of areas: generating explanations, advice and critiques in medical expert systems [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]; generating reports, briefings, progress notes and discharge letters for health professionals <ref> [19, 20, 21, 22, 23] </ref> and generating explanatory materials for patients [24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. <p> This has led to a recent interest inmultimedia generation. To generate a multimedia presentation from data involves selecting the appropriate modality (text, graphics etc) for communication, and coordinating the presentation so, for example, images are referred to in the text. Recent work at Columbia <ref> [23] </ref> has considered how multimedia post-operative briefings can be generated that meet the different needs of nurse and physician. 3.4 Generating Descriptions of Medical Concepts In most of the above applications there is a need for generating descriptions of medical concepts given a standard code (e.g., SNOMED, ICD-9) for that concept.

Rather than generating text from a knowledge base, HealthDoc starts with a master document. Generation involves selecting from this master document, and repairing the result to produce a coherent document. <p> Some have emphasised text planning [11, 12, 18, 24, 25, 26, 27], others sentence planning <ref> [19, 21, 28] </ref> or realisation [13, 14, 59].

Reference-contexts: Realization consisted of stringing together text using simple templates associated with expert system rules or primitive functions. Early systems such as MYCIN showed how far this basic approach could be taken <ref> [29] </ref>. The explanations produced using these simple methods are far from ideal. However, improving them requires as a basis, a richer source of information a simple rule trace will often miss key information that should be included in order for an explanation to be convincing.

Reference-contexts: More flexible and richer explanations may be generated by treating text or explanation planning as an independent problem. This is discussed by Moore <ref> [35] </ref> (although not for a medical domain). A simple example of independent text planning in a medical expert system is HF-EXPLAIN [12], which generates explanations for a heart failure expert system based on a causal model. <p> Screens of text are generated using a NLG system, with the user able to ask follow-up questions via a mixture of hypertext and menu selection. A fairly sophisticated text planner <ref> [35] </ref> is used to select content appropriate to each individual. The approach allows responses to later questions to be answered in the context of previous replies, referring back to these earlier responses and avoiding excessive repetition [44].

Reference-contexts: Improved patient education through better information has the potential to save large amounts of time and money, as well as lead to more satisfied and healthier patients. There is a large literature on the subject, but a good overview is given by Ley <ref> [39] </ref>. Currently, patient education is largely provided through verbal interaction with health professionals, and through leaflets, posters and other printed material. However, health professionals have limited time (and are not always good communicators), and generic leaflets are impersonal and unspecific, not addressing a particular patient's particular needs.

Several recent projects (Migraine, Piglit, OPADE and HealthDoc) have explored this.

Figure 4 gives an example text from the original system (words in bold font can be clicked on for further information). Both Piglit and Migraine use simple surface realisation based on selecting from human-authored templates (e.g., "The symptoms of Disease-X are Symptoms-Y") and filling in with specific data. <p> In a system (such as ICD-9) where a separate code is given for every distinguishable concept, then a simple mapping of code to preferred English phrase may be possible. But in more complex compositional schemes, such as that used in the GALEN terminology server <ref> [47] </ref>, generating the appropriate English phrase for a compositional concept becomes more difficult [58, 59]. However, although the generation of noun phrases is more complex, the approach can pay off if multilingual output is required [57].

Reference-contexts: The cough is improving and mild. It has a dry, non-productive character and a bovine, harsh sound character. It is aggravated by dust and smoking and relieved by rest generating reports on radiographs, using a fairly sophisticated "off-the shelf" sentence planning and realisation system (FUF <ref> [57] </ref>) to produce sentences. Bernauer et al [20] argue that for producing reports on bone scan studies, the variety of possible kinds of observations requires a relatively sophisticated realisation module; they use one developed specially for their task. <p> However, although the generation of noun phrases is more complex, the approach can pay off if multilingual output is required <ref> [57] </ref>. While the 1997 version of the UMLS [46] correlates terminologies in Spanish, German, Potuguese and French with those in English, the mapping of terms is only partial there are only translations available for all these languages for MeSH terms.
