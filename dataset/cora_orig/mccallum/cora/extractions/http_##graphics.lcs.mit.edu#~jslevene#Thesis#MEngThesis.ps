Reference-contexts: In perspective, objects can be made to appear distant by tilting or rotating them away from the projection plane. In the resulting image, sizes, shapes, spatial distances, and angles must be distorted simply to convey depth <ref> [1] </ref>. If, in the eye of a designer or engineer, conveying a scene's depth is secondary in importance to conveying the shape and location of its objects, an oblique projection might be a more direct and immediate approach. An example of this is shown in Figure 2-3. <p> The size, orientation, and location of each person at the table is clear, and it is also clear that the table is square and not rectangular. Third, as the psychologist Arnheim argues, perspective is well suited for representing interior spaces but offers ambiguous representations of exterior views of shapes <ref> [1] </ref>. This is true for two reasons. In perspective, each location on the projection plane corresponds to multiple parts of an object or to multiple objects. Also, because or-thogonals converge in the image, foreground tends to hide background and side faces of objects tend to be hidden. <p> In addition, since the more distant parts of the altarpiece are larger than nearby ones, its side faces are spread out and their details exposed. CHAPTER 2. NON-REALISTIC PROJECTIONS 22 uses an oblique-like projection, while the right image uses a perspective-like projection. (Illustration taken from <ref> [1] </ref>) a Spanish altarpiece of the fourteenth century, drawn with diverging orthogonals. Right: the same subject drawn with converging orthogonals. (Illustration taken from [1]) of a tree line extending into the distance, both drawn with converging orthogonals. Left: convergence occurs linearly. Right: orthogonals curve as they converge.

Reference-contexts: This, clearly, was a long and tedious process. In addition to sharing a common architecture, most non-photorealistic geometry-based systems have focused on simulating traditional media.

Reference-contexts: Two other systems addressed distortions resulting from the projection of an image onto a viewing surface. Max [13] addressed 180 ffi projection onto a domed theater, while Dorsey et al. <ref> [5] </ref> addressed projection onto a planar viewing surface from an angle. Both of these systems were designed to account for the resulting distortion by pre-distorting their output with a non-linear projection. Second, other systems have addressed the problem of visualizing 3D space in an image.

Reference-contexts: First, using a planar projection surface often causes an object's shape to be both distorted and ambiguous. As is well known, objects represented in perspective suffer major deformations when viewed from a wide angle <ref> [6] </ref>. In these situations, objects that lie in the periphery of a wide field of view may be stretched outward as shown in Figure 2-2b.

Reference-contexts: The classical rendering pipeline, a sequence of steps that scan-converting renderers follow in converting 3D geometry to a 2D image, indicates how photorealistic renderers achieve a degree of optical accuracy. Figure 1-3 shows one simple version of the pipeline based on <ref> [7] </ref>. As the figure indicates, the pipeline is a five stage process: 1. Lighting: once scene geometry is input into a scan-converting renderer, the geometry is lit at each vertex according to a local lighting model. CHAPTER 1.

Reference-contexts: In contrast to this view, more and more philosophers and art historians in recent years have noted the rather unnatural nature of photographs. Gombrich <ref> [8] </ref>, for example, shows how abstract a photograph really is through exposing the many artifices it employs: the micro-instant frozen forever, the limited angle of view, and the seeming arbitrariness of photographic processing. <p> Gombrich <ref> [8] </ref> has suggested that the goals of art are many-fold: exploring patterns, expression and abstraction, symbolism, magic, the mental world, and the perceptual world. A more abstract form of image generation (non-photorealistic image generation) is a necessary tool for such art. As an example, consider painting a natural scene.

Reference-contexts: Wood et al. [21] built a system to render a single background image, called a multi-perspective panorama, which incorporated multiple views of a 3D environment as seen from along a given camera path. When viewed through a small moving window, the panorama produced the illusion of 3D motion. Inakage <ref> [10] </ref> built a sys 16 CHAPTER 2.

Reference-contexts: At Boeing, even when CAD databases of airplane parts exist, all high-quality manuals are still illustrated by hand in order to provide more effective diagrams than can be achieved with either photorealistic rendering or simple hidden line drawings [19]. Lansdown and Schofield <ref> [11] </ref> also point out the shortcomings of photographs by asking, "How much use is a photograph to mechanics when they already have the real thing in front of them?" 1.2 The artistic shortcomings of photorealism From the perspective of an artist, an image has many other uses than simply imitating nature. <p> In addition to sharing a common architecture, most non-photorealistic geometry-based systems have focused on simulating traditional media.

Reference-contexts: A more abstract form of image generation (non-photorealistic image generation) is a necessary tool for such art. As an example, consider painting a natural scene.

Reference-contexts: If we look at the photograph in terms of its practical role as a means of visual communication, it is clearly not an optimal representation. Strothotte et al. <ref> [16] </ref> describe how photorealistic images fail to convey implicit information to a viewer. They write: More subtle and at the same time even less considered in the literature is the question of how a viewer is influenced by a graphical presentation. <p> A second problem is that architects often feel that a rendered image of an object appears "stale" compared CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 9 to the sense of vitality offered by hand-drawn graphics. Thus, rendered images are sometimes traced over by hand with pencil and paper, a tedious and unnecessary task <ref> [16] </ref>. Winkenbach and Salesin [19] explain how photorealistic images often fail to communicate complex information in a comprehensible and effective manner. In order to communicate truly complex information effectively, some form of visual abstraction is required. <p> This makes it very difficult, for example, to render different objects in the image in different styles. Previous non-photorealistic geometry-based systems were architected after the sketch-renderer presented in <ref> [16] </ref>. This architecture incorporates the notions of transmitted and transputed information, both of which are used as inputs to the renderer. Transmitted information is that which is encoded in the 3D geometry, and describes the elements of the scene and the way in which they are lit. <p> This, clearly, was a long and tedious process.

First, some have addressed the problem of correcting distortions in images. Zorin et al. <ref> [22] </ref> addressed distortions inherent in perspective transformations. Such distortions were corrected by employing perceptually preferable viewing transformations, each of which could be decomposed into a perspective or parallel projection followed by a planar transformation. Two other systems addressed distortions resulting from the projection of an image onto a viewing surface.
