Abstract: We give here an extension of the recent result of Kwong (which in turn extended earlier results of Coffman and McLeod and Serrin) on the uniqueness of the positive radial solution of a semilinear elliptic equation. When reduced to the special case considered by Kwong, our proof is shorter.

Reference-contexts: This problem arises in many applications. Please consult [8,9] for more information. Existence of positive solutions for various classes of f (u) has been obtained by many authors, including Berestycki and Lions <ref> [1] </ref>, and Berestycki, Lions, and Peletier [2]. The uniqueness problem is, however, more difficult. In general, a positive solution of (I) need not be radially symmetric. The interest in radial solutions is sparked by the well-known results of Gidas, Ni, and Nirenberg in [4,5].

Reference-contexts: Proof. This is very likely a known result, but we are not able to locate a complete reference. The decaying solution has been named the recessive solution or the principal solution; see Hartman <ref> [6] </ref>. The conclusions are consequences of the fact that f 0 (u) is eventually negative. Since we are 8 concerned only with asymptotic behavior, we may assume in the proof that f 0 (u) &lt; 0 for all u. <p> Since we are 8 concerned only with asymptotic behavior, we may assume in the proof that f 0 (u) &lt; 0 for all u. The existence of the principal solution and the behavior of the other solutions can be found in Corollary 6.4 of <ref> [6] </ref>. It remains to prove that W (r) = O (r 1m ) for the principal solution. This solution can be obtained by a shooting procedure.

Reference-contexts: Peletier and Serrin [13] succeeded in showing uniqueness for functions satisfying a starlike condition. Their result has been further extended by Kaper and Kwong <ref> [7] </ref>. Other uniqueness results have been obtained by Ni [11] and Ni and Nussbaum [12]. McLeod and Serrin [10] continued the study of Coff-man and extended his result to functions with a certain convexity property. <p> This method requires knowledge of the oscillatory behavior of the w (r) function, which seems to be difficult to obtain directly. We study a related shooting process, this time from the r-axis, backward towards r = a. The techniques of Peletier and Serrin [13] and Kaper and Kwong <ref> [7] </ref> can be used to show that no two solutions of this backward shooting can intersect below u = OE. This fact implies the nonoscillatory nature of the w (r) function associated with this second type of shooting. <p> Using an energy argument, we see that U (r; fi) must be strictly decreasing in [a; fi]. A monotone separation property was first established for g (r) = m=r in [13], and then for general g (r) in <ref> [7] </ref>, for ground states (solutions that decay to zero at 1). The same ideas in fact work to give a similar result on bounded intervals, which we state as Lemma 12 below. The proof is even simpler because r = 1 is not involved. We omit the details. <p> For all pairs of points oe ae &lt; r at which the two solutions have the same height, i.e., U (ae; fi) = U (r; b), U 0 (ae; fi) U 0 (r; b) &lt; 0: (3:8) The next step, as in [13] and <ref> [7] </ref>, is to use the monotone separation lemma to deduce that the two solutions actually cannot intersect below u = OE. As the proof works without change here, it is again omitted. Since U (r; b) OE in [a; b], the two solutions cannot intersect at all in [a; b]. <p> If w (r) has a second zero in (a; b), W (r) must also have one. This contradicts Lemma 14. We have thus completed the proof of the following theorem in the case b &lt; 1. The case b = 1 is already included in the results in <ref> [7] </ref> and [13]. Theorem 2 Suppose that f (u) satisfies [F4] and g (r) is a positive nonincreasing continuous function on the interval [a; b); (b 1). The boundary value problem (III) has a unique positive solution.

Reference-contexts: Some related uniqueness results for Emden-Fowler equations were established in [17] using a method of change of variables and differential inequalities | entirely different from the usual Coffman approach. 5 2 Proof of the Main Theorem As in all previous work, we use the Kolodner-Coffman method <ref> [8] </ref>. Let u (r; ff) be the solution to the initial value problem 8 : m u 0 (r) + f (u) = 0 r &gt; a; m &gt; 1 (2:1) Denote the first zero of u (r; ff), if there is one, by b (ff). <p> The remaining effort is devoted to showing that w (r) cannot have a second zero at or before b (ff), and to dealing with the case b (ff) = 1. In general, u (r; ff) may not have a zero in (a; 1). Following <ref> [8] </ref>, we partition the set of solutions into the following: N = fff 2 (0; 1) : b (ff) exists g ; (2:5) G = fff 2 (0; 1) N : u (r; ff) ! 0 as r ! 1g (2:6) We sometimes abuse the notation by saying that u (r;

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the technique works for a much wider class of nonlinear functions including f (u) = u p c i u q i , with q i &lt; p. The approach is a combination of those of Zhang [14] and Kwong <ref> [9] </ref>. After the present work was completed, we learned that McLeod has also obtained similar results using related techniques. In most aspects our results are more general. <p> For the case g (x) = 1, the result, besides providing a much shorter proof of the theorem in <ref> [9] </ref>, now covers the case of all homogeneous boundary conditions.

They also used a less general condition that is sometimes more convenient to verify. In Section 4 we shall discuss the relations between these various conditions and give some examples. Our main result can be stated as follows: Theorem 1 Suppose that [F1] - [F3] hold. <p> If f (u) and g (u) satisfy [G], so does the product f (u)g (u). A stronger condition was used in <ref> [10] </ref>. It is essentially the same as that stated in the next lemma. In [10], it is required only that some power of u exists with the desired properties (2.21) and (2.22). Our lemma goes one step further by specifying the optimal choice of such a power. <p> If f (u) and g (u) satisfy [G], so does the product f (u)g (u).

Reference-contexts: Yanagida [19] used the Pohozaev identity in a clever way to obtain the uniqueness of the ground state of the Matukuma equation, u + u p 1 + jxj 2 . His technique was modified by Kwong and Li <ref> [18] </ref> to treat problem (II) with an additional first-order term, namely, u 00 + mu 0 =r + f (u) + g (r)u = 0, and with general boundary conditions. <p> In <ref> [18] </ref>, we also extended the technique we used here to obtain uniqueness for the Matukuma equation in a finite interval, a situation in which Yanagida's method no longer works. <p> We give here another proof using Sturm's comparison theorem. It is this alternative method that enables us to obtain uniqueness results for the generalized Matukuma equation, u + q (jxj)u p = 0, reported in the forthcoming paper <ref> [18] </ref>. Alternative Proof. Let v (r) = ru 0 (r) + fiu (r); (2:31) where fi &gt; 0 is a constant to be chosen later.
