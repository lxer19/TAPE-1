Abstract: Astrolog 1 is a highly dynamic and decentralized management system meant for the management of Astrolab, which is a distributed system comprising of heterogeneous machines running varied operating systems connected by a LAN. The design of Astrolog strikes a balance between a centralized management system and a totally distributed management system drawing on strengths of both the mechanisms. It introduces a unique dynamically variant hierarchical management architecture. It also introduces the concept of a mobile network manager for the first time. Astrolog is designed for management of a platform which is in extensive and regular usage, thus the design is highly practical in approach.
