Abstract: In this paper we present a method for compression of stereo images. The proposed scheme is a frequency domain approach based on the suppression theory of binocular vision. By using the information in the frequency domain, complex disparity estimation techniques can be avoided. The wavelet transform is used to obtain a multiresolution analysis of the stereo pair by which the subbands convey the necessary frequency domain information.

Reference-contexts: Since stereo images require twice the bandwidth of conventional monoscopic images, compression of stereo images is one of the foremost issues that must be addressed to enable the widespread use of three-dimensional systems. We present a method for stereoscopic image compression based on the suppression theory of binocular vision <ref> [1] </ref>. This approach is based on the frequency domain relationship between stereo images and not on the spatial domain (disparity) relationship. With the proposed technique, compression can be achieved without implementing disparity estimation techniques, and thus the complexity of the coding scheme can be reduced. <p> However, the penalty for adding this information is an increase in the bit rate. 2. BINOCULAR VISION 2.1. Suppression Theory When the two eyes are presented with two similar images, the result is a single percept of the scene. This phenomenon is known as binocular fusion <ref> [1] </ref>. On the other hand, when the two eyes are presented with two distinctly different images, instead of being combined the two images will be in competition with each other. This is known as binocular rivalry [1]. The final percept is an unstable shifting between the patterns of each eye. <p> This phenomenon is known as binocular fusion <ref> [1] </ref>. On the other hand, when the two eyes are presented with two distinctly different images, instead of being combined the two images will be in competition with each other. This is known as binocular rivalry [1]. The final percept is an unstable shifting between the patterns of each eye. Because of this unstable combination of the two images, certain sections of one image will dominate certain sections of the other image. This alternation of patterns results from a shift in dominance between each eye.

Reference-contexts: The suppression theory leads to the following compression scheme: one image of the stereo pair retains the details of the scene, while the second image retains the disparity information. Hence, the second image can be highly compressed without affecting the depth information in the compressed stereo images <ref> [2] </ref>. This compression scheme has been used in several different methods. Serthuraman and et al. [3] use a multiresolution approach, and Rabany and et al. [4] use a disparity compensation technique. Both algorithms compute the disparity between the stereo images. However, Dinstein and et al. [2] and Perkins [5] provided methods <p> in the compressed stereo images <ref> [2] </ref>.

The DCT-based coding was then applied to the low-resolution version of second image. At the decoder side, the right image was decoded with the DCT method, and the left image was decoded with the DCT method and then upsampled to the original resolution.

This not only will enhance the depth perception but also will improve the quality of the second image. Previous methods used to obtain the low-resolution image effectively destroyed all the high-frequency information <ref> [5] </ref>. The wavelet transform avoids this problem by working on the stereo pair. 2.2. Zone of Suppression In the next section we provide a method for adding high-frequency information to the low-resolution image. The method is based on the experimental results of Liu and Schor [7].

Reference-contexts: This alternation of patterns results from a shift in dominance between each eye. Information in the less dominant image will be suppressed, while the information in the dominant image will be visible. Julesz <ref> [6] </ref> observed this phenomenon while working with random-dot stereograms and reported that binocular fusion depends on the spatial frequency relationship between the two images. For fusion to occur, either the low- or high-frequency (or both) components must be identical. <p> For fusion to occur, either the low- or high-frequency (or both) components must be identical. If the low- or high-frequency components differ, binocular rivalry will occur, and the image that contains the high-frequency information in a particular section will dominate the final perception <ref> [6] </ref>. Therefore, we will have suppression of different frequency bands. Recall that the methods described in the preceding section used a low-resolution version of the second image. In the frequency domain this amounts to splitting the image spectrum in half and discarding the high-frequency components. <p> Subband l 1 is necessary to represent a coarse description of the disparity information. Since it represents the low-frequency information of the left image, it is also necessary to prevent binocular rivalry <ref> [6] </ref>. Vertical edges at low spatial frequencies are given by subband l 2 . For intermediate frequencies, subband l 7 is chosen. For high spatial frequencies, horizontal edges are mainly being suppressed, so subband l 9 is chosen. The remaining subbands are not transmitted or are set to zero.

Zone of Suppression In the next section we provide a method for adding high-frequency information to the low-resolution image. The method is based on the experimental results of Liu and Schor <ref> [7] </ref>. Liu and Schor measured the suppression zone as a function of spatial frequency and orientation (i.e., horizontal and vertical). The results of their experiments indicate that both the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the suppression zone decrease with increasing spatial frequency. <p> However, at high spatial frequencies, the opposite occurred. The horizontal extent of the suppression zone was larger than the vertical extent and was also elliptical, with the major axis in the horizontal direction. For intermediate spatial frequencies, the shape of the suppression zone was shown to be circular <ref> [7] </ref>. 3. PROPOSED METHOD A block diagram of our method is shown in Figure 1. The wavelet transform is applied to each image of the stereo pair independently. One image is selected as the reference image, and the other is selected as the secondary image.

Reference-contexts: Also, for the secondary image, the subbands that are selected need to be transmitted to the decoder as well. This information is sent as side information. 3.1.

In order to eliminate any border effects due to the finite extent of the images, symmetric extension of the image borders is used. The number of decomposition levels is three and is constant throughout. This results in ten subbands per image and twenty overall.

Reference-contexts: The solution to this problem is obtained by using the Lagrange multiplier method. For small subband variances, it can result in negative bit rate assignments. To overcome negative bit rate assignments for B k , the modified procedure in <ref> [10] </ref> is used. <p> Now, we have the additional constraint that B k is nonnegative <ref> [10] </ref>. The solution is given by B k = A s;M 1 log 2 4 r k k=1 (oe 2 A k A s;M 5 ; (3) where A s;M = P M k=1 A k . <p> Directions for future research include extending this method to compression of stereo video sources and incorporating other perceptual properties into the compression scheme. For example, perceptual weighting in the bit allocation problem has shown to increase performance especially at low bit rates <ref> [10] </ref>. Also, other perceptual studies focus on providing a better quantitative analysis of the frequency domain relationship between the stereo images.

Reference-contexts: For the low-frequency sub-bands, differential pulse code modulation is used. The high-frequency subbands, on the other hand, are quantized by using pulse code modulation. The quantization coefficients are Lloyd-Max quantizers and have been generated based on the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) <ref> [11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The shape parameter, ff, for each subband is estimated by using the O 2 -test statistic <ref> [12] </ref>. A test set consisting of five stereo images with three levels of decomposition is used for estimating ff. The results show that for the low-frequency subbands ff = 0:8 and for the high-frequency subbands ff = 0:6. The quantizer outputs are entropy coded for further reduction in bit rate.

Reference-contexts: The results show that for the low-frequency subbands ff = 0:8 and for the high-frequency subbands ff = 0:6. The quantizer outputs are entropy coded for further reduction in bit rate. Huffman coding is applied to the quan tizer outputs, which produces a variable length code <ref> [13] </ref>. The encoded output is then sent to the channel for either transmission or storage. 4. SIMULATIONS The proposed compression scheme was tested on two different stereo pairs. The stereo images have a spatial resolution of 512 fi 512 with 8 bits per pixel (bpp).
