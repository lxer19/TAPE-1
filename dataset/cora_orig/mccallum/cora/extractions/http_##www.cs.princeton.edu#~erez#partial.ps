Abstract: We consider the question: Is finding just a part of a solution easier than finding the full solution? For example, is finding only an * fraction of the bits in a satisfying assignment to a 3-CNF formula easier than computing the whole assignment? For several important problems in N P we show that obtaining only a small fraction of the solution is as hard as finding the full solution.

Reference-contexts: This is done using some "padding" tricks. The same padding technique will later be used in the proof of Theorem 1. We start by stating the existence of good deterministic constructions of erasure codes. Perhaps the sim plest construction is due to Alon <ref> [1] </ref>, in which a Reed-Solomon code is concatenated with the simplex binary code. The result (with the appropriate setting of the parameters) is summarized in the next proposition. Proposition 2.1 ([1]) There exists a binary linear code with codewords of size n and dimension k &gt; p which can correct up

Reference-contexts: An important question in cryptography is the relation between obtaining partial information about a secret and computing the whole secret. Indeed, this is the question that underlies the notion of hard-core bits of cryptographic functions (see, e.g., <ref> [6, 5, 9] </ref>). Our results are in the same spirit, thus providing some more insight into this interesting question. Structural complexity. An important theme in structural complexity is to study the power of different kinds of oracles.

Reference-contexts: Remark. Note that although the padding can be enhanced to deal with more erasures, there are no codes with polynomial expansion which are able to correct n=2 erasures or more (see <ref> [11, Eq. (4) on Page 43] </ref>). 2.3 Erasures of nearly all the bits We now show how to overcome erasures of all but n 1 2 +* of the bits in a satisfying assignment. This is surprisingly better than the correction ability of erasure codes.
