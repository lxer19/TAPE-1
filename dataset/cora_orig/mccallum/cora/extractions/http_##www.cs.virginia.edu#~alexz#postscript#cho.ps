Abstract: In this paper we study a trail routing and a hamiltonian cycle in a class of grid graphs, polycube and polymino. A Spanning closed trail is an eulerian subgraph containing all vertices of a given graph. For general grid graphs we prove that the problem of finding that trail is N P -complete and for a wide subclass of grid graphs, called polymino, we give an optimal algorithm if it exists. For polycube graphs we prove that every polycube has a spanning closed trail. Finally we show that a graph product G to a simple path with length n, G fi P n , is hamiltonian for all n 2, if G is a polymino with a perfect matching.

Reference-contexts: They gave some sufficient conditions for supereulerian graphs, but did not show any algorithms to find a trail. 2 Spanning Closed Trail in Polyminos In the following a path means an alternating sequence of vertices and edges and a trail is a path with all distinct edges <ref> [5] </ref>. The planar rectangular grid consists of vertices f (x; y)j x; y 2 Zg and edges f (u; v)j u; v 2 V; ju vj = 1g. A grid graph R = (V; E) is a finite subgraph of the planar rectangular grid [7].

Reference-contexts: Note that if a hamiltonian cycle exists, then it is the shortest trail. The Hamilton circuit problem is N P -complete for grid graphs, but it is still unknown whether this problem is N P -complete for simple polyminoes (see <ref> [6] </ref>). We show that the Trail Problem can be solved in linear time for simple polyminoes and so called cell connected polyminoes with holes. <p> We also show that the Trail Problem for cell-connected polyminoes can be solved in linear time. Theorem 6. The Trail Problem in polymino with holes is N P -complete. Proof. Our proof is similar to the proof in <ref> [6] </ref>. We transform the Hamilton Circuit Problem (HCP) in planar cubic maps to Trail Problem. For each vertex of a cubic map we assign points of a block. For each edge of a cubic map M we replace it by a dragon with two heads, i.e. a chain-dragon. <p> They gave a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the hamiltonian path in rectangular grids <ref> [6] </ref>. Also they have shown that the hamiltonian problem for general grids is N P -complete. But it should be noted that their grid graph is different from our polymino graphs in that our polymino model does not allow any degenerated faces or holes.
