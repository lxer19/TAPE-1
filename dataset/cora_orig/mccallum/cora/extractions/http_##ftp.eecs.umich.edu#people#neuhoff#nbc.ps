Title: Optimal Binary Index Assignments for a Class of Equiprobable Scalar and Vector Quantizers 1  
Author: Steven W. McLaughlin David L. Neuhoff and Jonathan J. Ashley 
Keyword: Index terms: source-channel coding, natural binary code, vector quantization.  
Abstract: The problem of scalar and vector quantization in conjunction with a noisy binary symmetric channel is considered. The issue is the assignment of the shortest possible distinct binary sequences to quantization levels or vectors so as to minimize the mean squared error caused by channel errors. By formulating the assignment as a matrix (or vector in the scalar case) and showing that the mean squared error due to channel errors is determined by the projections of its columns onto the eigenspaces of the multidimensional channel transition matrix, a class of source/quantizer pairs is identified for which the optimal index assignment has a simple and natural form. Among other things, this provides a simpler and more accessible proof of the result of Crimmins et al. that the natural binary code is an optimal index assignment for the uniform scalar quantizer and uniform source. It also provides a potentially useful approach to further developments in source-channel coding.

Reference-contexts: We identify cases in which such guided assignments are simply the natural binary assignment, which assigns the usual L-bit binary expansion of the integer i to the i'th level of a quantizer with 2 L levels. It was previously shown, though apparently less well known, by Crimmins et. al <ref> [8] </ref>, that the natural binary assignment was optimal for a uniform source and a uniform scalar quantizer. Our results provide a simple, more accessible proof of this fact, which in [8] was demonstrated using Fourier transforms on abelian groups. <p> It was previously shown, though apparently less well known, by Crimmins et. al <ref> [8] </ref>, that the natural binary assignment was optimal for a uniform source and a uniform scalar quantizer.

For a uniform source on h 2 ; N i matched to an N -point uniform scalar quantizer, and a binary symmetric channel with crossover probability q &lt; :5, the natural binary assignment is an optimum index assignment.

Reference-contexts: This happens, for example, in the important special case where the source density is uniform on the support of a uniform quantizer, as considered in [4]-[6],[8]. Quantizers of this type, sometimes called maximum output entropy quantizers, were discussed in <ref> [17] </ref>, where it was shown that for a class of nonuniform quantizers, including the Gaussian source, quantizers with maximum output entropy have distortion within a multiplicative constant of the minimum mean squared error scalar quantizer.

Reference-contexts: Then Corollary 3 implies the resulting assignment vector z is in E 1 and, consequently, the index assignment implied by z is optimal. A codebook whose levels have the form in (17) will be called an antipodal direct sum codebook, because it is the direct sum <ref> [20] </ref> of the L antipodal codebooks fff 0 ; ff 0 g, fff 1 ; ff 1 g, : : : ; fff L1 ; ff L1 g . We consider fff 0 ; : : : ; ff L1 g to be a basis for the code-book. <p> If the source is uniform over the support region, then the natural binary assignment is again optimum. 2 Comments Direct sum quantizers are often implemented in a multistage or successive approximation fashion ([14] p. 667, [18], [19] p. 194 ff. 451 ff, and <ref> [20] </ref>).
