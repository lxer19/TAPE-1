Abstract: We use the two time influence functional method of the path integral approach in order to reduce the dimension of the coupled-channels equations for heavy-ion reactions based on the no-Coriolis approximation. Our method is superior to other methods in that it easily enables us to study the cases where the initial spin of the colliding particle is not zero. It can also be easily applied to the cases where there is a spin-orbit force, and where the internal degrees of freedom are not necessarily collective coordinates. It also clarifies the underlying assumption of the approximation.

Reference-contexts: is by now well established that heavy-ion fusion reactions at energies below the Coulomb barrier are not such simple processes that can be described in terms of a penetration through one dimensional potential barrier, but rather complicated reactions where internal degrees of freedom of colliding nuclei play an essential role <ref> [1] </ref>. Therefore they are typical examples of a macroscopic quantum tunneling, which has been a very popular subject in the past decade in many fields of physics and chemistry [2, 3, 4].

One of the major interests in the macroscopic quantum tunneling is to assess the effects of environments on the tunneling rate of a macroscopic degree of freedom. A standard way to tackle this problem in nuclear physics is to numerically solve the associated coupled-channels equations.

Reference-contexts: This makes the intuitive understanding of the numerical results quite hard. For this reason, an approximation named the no-Coriolis approximation, which is sometimes called the rotating frame approximation, has been introduced [5-11]. It is a kind of sudden tunneling approximation <ref> [12] </ref> concerning the centrifugal energy and it greatly reduces the number of coupled channels to be solved. The no-Coriolis approximation was first introduced in the field of chemistry under the name centrifugal sudden approximation [13, 14, 15]. Recently, it has also been applied to a problem of electron-molecule scattering [16]. <p> If we denote the coordinate representation of by 0 <ref> [12] </ref>, we get &lt; 0 j^u (R; T )j (n i L i I i )J M &gt; = exp 0 2R (t 0 ) 2 + H 0 (~) + V (R (t 0 ); 0 ; ~) fi m L ;m I We next make a rotational coordinate transformation
