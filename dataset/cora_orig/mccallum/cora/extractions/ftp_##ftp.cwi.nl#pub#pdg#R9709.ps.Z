Abstract: pdg@cwi.nl CWI technical report no.INS-R9709 Abstract Most `causal' approaches to reasoning about action have not addressed the basic question of causality directly: what has to be the case in a domain in order for the assertion `A causes B' to be valid with respect to the domain? Pearl's recent causal theories based on structural equations do provide an answer to this question. In this paper, we extend Pearl's formalism so that the typical problems encountered in common sense reasoning about action can be represented in it. The resulting theory comes in both a propositional and a first-order version. The propositional version turns out to be capable of handling many complicated instances of the ramification problem, including domains that contain cyclic causal relationships. It also provides new insights into actions with non-deterministic and/or `disjunctive' effects. The first-order version additionally handles domains with `dependent' fluents, incompletely specified action schedules, causal chains of events and `surprises'. We provide an in-depth comparison between our theory and three other recent approaches: those of McCain & Turner, Baral & Gelfond and Lin. For the former two, we show that they can be reinterpreted as approximations of our extension of Pearl's theory: we prove theorems stating that for large classes of reasoning domains, they permit the same inferences as our theory does, and we give examples of reasoning domains that fall outside these classes, for which our approach clearly works better. For the approach of Lin, we show informally that, for those reasoning domains on which both his and our approach are defined, the two approaches are nearly equivalent. In this way we are able to establish a connection between Lin's approach and Pearl's semantics of causation. Since all concepts in our theory which involve causality are defined in completely non-causal terms, we hope that our work may help bridge the conceptual gap between `causal' and `non-causal' approaches to common sense temporal reasoning.

Reference-contexts: Rather it is an assumption about what we really mean when we specify our domain knowledge in a certain way. It is thus what Amsterdam calls a `narrative convention' <ref> [1] </ref>. We could avoid having to live with assumption (b) by explicitly stating for each fluent the complete set of actions by which it can be affected. Indeed, something similar is done in several other approaches [7, 8, 35].

We first discuss the former possibility, delaying treatment of the latter until section 7.4. 7.2 Handling Events like in the Situation Calculus We first extend our definition of causal theories to incorporate axioms (31) and (32). <p> Following Morgenstern & Stein [28, 36], Baral, Gelfond and Provetti <ref> [3, 5] </ref> and several other authors, we would like to extend this to the case where more than one event may happen at a time.

L 3 extends A to deal with concurrent actions, actions with non-deterministic effects and observations of the actions that take place and the fluents that hold in arbitrary situations. <p> We first have to explain the basics of BG's approach though. For more details we refer to [3] and especially to the much more extended <ref> [5] </ref>. Strictly speaking, the latter reference is about L 1 and not L 3 , but L 3 is only a minor extension of L 1 . Review of L 3 BG's approach consists of domain descriptions D written in a language L 3 . <p> This will be echoed in condition (a) of the definition of `semantical correspondence' (def. 8.6). * The third problem is that the definition of modelhood comes in two versions in BG's papers <ref> [5] </ref>. In one of the two versions, logically consistent initial states are never ruled out, even if this would lead to models in which more actions occur than is strictly necessary. In the other version only the models with a minimal number of actions are selected. <p> Several existing approaches employ a `causes'-construct which has a semantics similar to our Do, but usually, this construct cannot be freely combined with observations (see for example <ref> [5, 11, 23, 38] </ref>). It is this freedom that makes the representational power of our formalism go beyond most existing ones. In future work, we would like to make a more extensive comparison between our approach and that of Thielscher [38].

Reference-contexts: If we take a probabilistic stance towards abnormalities, then there is no problem. In this case, `abnormal' is identified with `having small probability' and we always prefer the `most probable models' <ref> [12] </ref>; see also appendix A.3. A priori, the probability of each `abnormal' event is very small, so the probability of models in which (36) and therefore, also (43) holds is very small too.

We are now ready to harvest. 8 5 Ramifications The ramification problem [34] has been given a lot of attention recently <ref> [21, 15, 23, 25, 38] </ref>. It occurs in domains where an action or event has only a small number of direct effects while it can have a very large number of indirect effects. <p> As pointed out by Sandewall and Gustafsson & Doherty <ref> [15, 33] </ref>, we do not always want to reason in the `causal direction' that is implied by the above; for example, consider the switches domain (example 4) again: if we know that the light has been put off, we may want to conclude that (at least) one of the two switches <p> What happens if we turn off the light will be discussed in example 8. The example above leads to a problem for some of the earlier causal approaches (i.e. those of Gustafsson & Doherty and McCain & Turner; see <ref> [15] </ref> for the details). The reason is that in these approaches, constructions similar to X Do (Y; true) are used at places where one should use Do (X; true) Do (Y; true); see the remark at the end of section 5.1. <p> Related observations have led some authors to claim that there is more to ramification than mere causal relationships as stated in Gustafsson & Doherty, `physical causality is simply one of several reasons one might set up dependencies between fluents' <ref> [15] </ref>. We think that our `Pearlian' approach sheds some new light on this issue: we define causal relations (i.e. relations involving interventions) fully in non-causal terms; this is reflected in choosing the name Do rather than Causes for our interventions. <p> On the other hand, our use of Do is much less restrictive than Thielscher's use of causes. We plan to study the exact differences between Thielscher's and our approach in the near future. Another approach that deserves further attention is the one based on Sandewall's and Doherty's occlusion concept <ref> [34, 33, 15] </ref>. Especially the way it is used by Gustafsson and Doherty [15] is strongly reminiscent of Lin's use of the Caused-predicate and thus also related to our use of Do. <p> We plan to study the exact differences between Thielscher's and our approach in the near future.

Reference-contexts: (Push; 0), then the preferred models would be those in which no events at all take place. 22 7.6 Surprise, Surprise What if a fluent changes value while we have no event in our domain which can account for that? This is the kind of surprise that Lifschitz and Rabinov <ref> [20] </ref> called a `miracle'. In order to deal with it, we have to weaken our structural equations concerning regular fluents: persistence may now be broken not only by some intervention, but also by some `abnormal' (unlikely) external influence.

Moreover, we find that the resulting theory is remarkably similar to several existing causal approaches, most notably Thielscher's [38] and Lin's <ref> [21, 22] </ref>. <p> If M is a model for a 2-point causal theory T , we write Mj= c T . We are now ready to harvest. 8 5 Ramifications The ramification problem [34] has been given a lot of attention recently <ref> [21, 15, 23, 25, 38] </ref>. It occurs in domains where an action or event has only a small number of direct effects while it can have a very large number of indirect effects. <p> It is easy to check that there indeed exists an interpretation with such a final state that is a model for T ct;3 . Example 5 [The Suitcase & Switches Problem] The following example is due to Lifs-chitz' [19]. It is equivalent to Lin's <ref> [21] </ref> `suitcase problem'. <p> is that some previous approaches cannot express the domain properly: they cannot rule out models in which, as a result of turning on one switch in a context in which the other one is on already, the other switch may jump into the off-position while light remains out; see Lin <ref> [21] </ref> for details. We formalize the domain using event and fluent sets E = ; and F = fSwi 1 ; Swi 2 ; Lightg. Swi i denotes that switch i is in the on-position. <p> We leave detailed comparisons until section 8 and give only a suggestive example for the time being. In Thielscher's work, the equivalent of axiom (6) looks as follows ([38], page 330): :Alive causes :Walking In Lin's work <ref> [21, 22] </ref>, we would get: Caused (Alive; false; s) Caused (Walking; false; s) In McCain & Turner's approach [23, 24, 25], it would be formalized as: :Alive ) :Walking (18) where `)' is to be read as `if :Alive, then the fact that :Walking is caused' [24]. <p> that accounts for it, it will preferably be assumed that this action takes place than that some external `miracle' or `surprise' happens. 8 Comparison to Other Approaches We now give a detailed comparison of our causal theories to three existing approaches: those of McCain & Turner [23, 25, 24], Lin <ref> [21, 22] </ref> and Baral, Gelfond and Provetti [3, 4, 5]. Each of the three approaches will be compared to the instantiation of our theory that is conceptually closest to it. <p> The importance of the equivalence theorems is that they show that some approaches which at first glance look rather different from ours are actually quite similar; therefore they are also connected to Pearl's sufficient cause principle, albeit implicitly. In our comparison 24 to Lin's <ref> [21, 22] </ref> approach, we have not bothered to try and prove such a theorem, since it is easy to see, just by looking at the definitions, that his approach is almost equivalent to ours. 8.1 McCain & Turner's Theory of Ramifications and Qualifications Recently, McCain & Turner (MT) have introduced a <p> S 0 2 1 (S; E; C) ) there exists an Mj= c T c with M ~ = (S; S 0 ) Mj= c T c ) 1 (S; E; C) contains an S 0 with M ~ = (S; S 0 ) 8.2 Lin's Embrace of Causality Lin <ref> [21, 22] </ref> has recently introduced a new method for reasoning about action that is based on a version of the situation calculus [27]. In the situation calculus, time is modeled by situations s rather than time points. <p> Lin's Caused-predicate is ternary: Caused (f; v; s) is true if the fluent f is caused to have the truth value v in situation s. On page 28 we give a (somewhat extended) quote of <ref> [21] </ref> which describes the method. The last step of Lin's method is meant to deal with the qualification problem which we do not address in this paper, so it will be of no concern to us.

It occurs in domains where an action or event has only a small number of direct effects while it can have a very large number of indirect effects. <p> This cannot be simply done by adding constraints between fluents to our theory; for example, suppose the turkey from our previous examples may either be walking or not, denoted by the fluent Walking. As pointed out by several authors <ref> [23] </ref>, if the turkey is alive and walking when being shot at, it will stop walking: :Walking is a ramification of the effect of Shoot. <p> Example 4 [the Clever Turkey] The following example was introduced by Thielscher [38]. It is interesting for two reasons: first, as argued extensively by Thielscher [38], it cannot be handled by McCain & Turner's theory of ramifications <ref> [23] </ref>. Secondly, the example shows that it may be useful to include axioms of the form X :Do (Y; b) in cons to express qualifications on interventions. <p> In Thielscher's work, the equivalent of axiom (6) looks as follows ([38], page 330): :Alive causes :Walking In Lin's work [21, 22], we would get: Caused (Alive; false; s) Caused (Walking; false; s) In McCain & Turner's approach <ref> [23, 24, 25] </ref>, it would be formalized as: :Alive ) :Walking (18) where `)' is to be read as `if :Alive, then the fact that :Walking is caused' [24]. <p> action in the domain that accounts for it, it will preferably be assumed that this action takes place than that some external `miracle' or `surprise' happens. 8 Comparison to Other Approaches We now give a detailed comparison of our causal theories to three existing approaches: those of McCain & Turner <ref> [23, 25, 24] </ref>, Lin [21, 22] and Baral, Gelfond and Provetti [3, 4, 5].

It is this freedom that makes the representational power of our formalism go beyond most existing ones. In future work, we would like to make a more extensive comparison between our approach and that of Thielscher [38].

Indeed, something similar is done in several other approaches <ref> [7, 8, 35] </ref>. However, one of the main problems we are interested in solving is the ramification problem often, we will deal with actions that can have a very large number of indirect effects and it would be very unwieldy to specify all of those explicitly; see section 5.

Reference-contexts: The second, more complicated possibility is to allow for multiple actions happening at the same time; this is similar to what happens in the works of Morgenstern & Stein and Baral, Gelfond & Provetti <ref> [5, 36] </ref>. We first discuss the former possibility, delaying treatment of the latter until section 7.4. 7.2 Handling Events like in the Situation Calculus We first extend our definition of causal theories to incorporate axioms (31) and (32). <p> Following Morgenstern & Stein <ref> [28, 36] </ref>, Baral, Gelfond and Provetti [3, 5] and several other authors, we would like to extend this to the case where more than one event may happen at a time.

Reference-contexts: However, in domains involving specificity, BG and our approach give different results, and we claim that for these domains, BG gives the less intuitive ones. The default assumption of specificity says that `more specific information about actions overrides less specific information'. We illustrate this using a standard example <ref> [37] </ref>: suppose that if you lift a bowl of soup with either your left or your right hand, but not both, then you will spill the soup and the table will get wet. If you lift the bowl with both hands however, then you will not spill the soup.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently there has been a strong revival of causality-based approaches to common-sense reasoning about action <ref> [23, 25, 24, 21, 22, 38, 5] </ref>. Causal approaches have proven to be particularly useful in the context of modeling ramifications and actions with non-deterministic effects. <p> 1 Introduction Recently there has been a strong revival of causality-based approaches to common-sense reasoning about action [23, 25, 24, 21, 22, 38, 5]. Causal approaches have proven to be particularly useful in the context of modeling ramifications and actions with non-deterministic effects. Indeed, it has been argued by some <ref> [38] </ref> that the explicit modeling of causal relationships is a necessary ingredient of any solution to the ramification problem. Still, witness the frequently heated debates on the issue taking place during workshops and conferences, it seems that many researchers remain skeptical about the power and applicability of causal approaches. <p> The theory turns out to provide a simple solution for many of the notorious problems of common-sense temporal reasoning . Moreover, we find that the resulting theory is remarkably similar to several existing causal approaches, most notably Thielscher's <ref> [38] </ref> and Lin's [21, 22]. <p> If M is a model for a 2-point causal theory T , we write Mj= c T . We are now ready to harvest. 8 5 Ramifications The ramification problem [34] has been given a lot of attention recently <ref> [21, 15, 23, 25, 38] </ref>. It occurs in domains where an action or event has only a small number of direct effects while it can have a very large number of indirect effects. <p> section we give a first demonstration of the utility of 2-point causal theories by showing how they correctly handle several types of ramification constraints that are known to pose problems for many existing approaches; the only other approach we are aware of that handles all of them correctly is Thielscher's <ref> [38] </ref>. In Thielscher's paper one also finds an excellent analysis of why these examples cause so many difficulties. Example 3 [The Walking Turkey] Let us formalize the example above. <p> This means that there are no models for T wt with both :Alive (0) and Entice: Entice has Alive as an implicit qualification. Example 4 [the Clever Turkey] The following example was introduced by Thielscher <ref> [38] </ref>. It is interesting for two reasons: first, as argued extensively by Thielscher [38], it cannot be handled by McCain & Turner's theory of ramifications [23]. <p> This means that there are no models for T wt with both :Alive (0) and Entice: Entice has Alive as an implicit qualification.

Secondly, the example shows that it may be useful to include axioms of the form X :Do (Y; b) in cons to express qualifications on interventions. Axioms corresponding to this form do not exist in Thielscher's [38] formalism, and indeed, his formalization of the domain looks rather different from ours. Imagine we want to hunt a turkey using a trap-door rather than a gun. <p> Recently, some authors have, either explicitly or implicitly, begun to take up this question <ref> [25, 38] </ref>. A special case of this question concerns the more well-known 13 issue of representing actions with non-deterministic effects [3, 25, 34]. <p> Several existing approaches employ a `causes'-construct which has a semantics similar to our Do, but usually, this construct cannot be freely combined with observations (see for example <ref> [5, 11, 23, 38] </ref>). It is this freedom that makes the representational power of our formalism go beyond most existing ones. In future work, we would like to make a more extensive comparison between our approach and that of Thielscher [38]. <p> It is this freedom that makes the representational power of our formalism go beyond most existing ones.

Apart from Pearl, Thielscher is one of the few authors in the field who tries to make completely clear what he means by a causal law, i.e. he attempts to give a semantics to statements of the form `A causes B' in non-causal terms.
