Title: Deciding Finiteness for Matrix Groups over Function Fields  
Author: Daniel N. Rockmore Ki-Seng Tan Robert Beals 
Date: January 26, 1998  
Abstract: Let F be a field and t an indeterminate. In this paper we consider aspects of the problem of deciding if a finitely generated subgroup of GL(n; F(t)) is finite. When F is a number field, the analysis may be easily reduced to deciding finiteness for subgroups of GL(n; F), for which the results of [1] can be applied. When F is a finite field, the situation is more subtle. In this case our main results are a structure theorem generalizing a theorem of Weil and upper bounds on the size of a finite subgroup generated by a fixed number of generators with examples of constructions almost achieving the bounds. We use these results to then give exponential deterministic algorithms for deciding finiteness as well as some preliminary results towards more efficient randomized algorithms.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently, computational group theory has directed increased attention to the development of algorithms for studying matrix groups. In particular, various recognition algorithms are of importance. These algorithms efficiently identify a group given by a set of generators by deciding various properties of the group from the generators (cf. <ref> [1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15] </ref> as well as the volumes [8, 9] and the many references therein). For a potentially infinite group, possibly the most fundamental property to be determined of a set of generators is that of finiteness. <p> That is, = GL (n; F (t)), for t an indeterminate and F either a number field or the finite field of q elements. In the former case, the analysis is easily reduced to that of deciding finiteness for GL (n; F), for which efficient algorithms are known <ref> [1] </ref>. On the other hand for the finite field case, no such quick reduction is apparent as some of the key tools used in the number field case (the semisimplicity of the enveloping algebra and the bounded order of any finite subgroup) no longer obtain. New ideas seem necessary here. <p> In Section 2 we consider the number field case. We show that in polynomial time we can either recognize the group as infinite or construct an isomorphic subgroup of GL (m; F) (for m not necssarily equal to n). In the latter case the techniques of <ref> [1] </ref> can be applied. Thus, for number fields we are able to give a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding finiteness (Theorem 2.1). fl Department of Mathematics, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH 03755.

By the results of <ref> [1] </ref>, it is enough to give a polynomial-time reduction to the case of GL (n; F). Theorem 2.1 Let F be a number field and let hSi = G GL (n; F (t)). <p> Corollary 2.3 Let G GL (n; Q (t)) be finite. Then there exists a finite extension K=Q and a matrix Y 2 GL (n; K (t)) such that Y AY 1 2 GL (n; Z) for all A 2 G. Proof: By Theorem 2.4 of <ref> [1] </ref>, any finite subgroup of GL (n; Q) is conjugate to a finite subgroup of GL (n; Z). The result then follows using Lemma 2.2. Corollary 2.4 (1) Let F be of characterstic zero. <p> In the former case the group is infinite. In the latter case, the basis over F can be used to either find a faithful representation of G in GL (d; F) for some d n 2 , which can be tested to be finite using the results of <ref> [1] </ref>. By successive matrix multiplications and Gaussian elimination we have the following result. Lemma 2.5 Let hSi = G GL (n; F (t)).

Reference-contexts: Direct application of this line of approach gives deterministic algorithms for deciding finiteness for which we can only derive an exponential upper bound. Of a more speculative nature is a randomized approach. Parker's "Meat-Axe" <ref> [16] </ref> is a randomized algorithm used to decompose modular representations of finite groups. We outline how an adaptation of this method could be used in our situation. Acknowledgement. <p> The main tool we use is a result of S. P.
