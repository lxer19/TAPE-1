Title: On Some Tighter Inapproximability  
Abstract: Results Abstract We prove a number of improved inaproximability results, including the best up to date explicit approximation thresholds for MIS problem of bounded degree, bounded occurrences MAX-2SAT, and bounded degree Node Cover. We prove also for the first time inapproxima-bility of the problem of Sorting by Reversals and display an explicit approximation threshold. This last problem was proved only recently to be NP-hard, in contrast to its signed version which is computable in polynomial time.

Reference-contexts: The last reduction, , converts a breakpoint graph G into a permutation (G), an instance of sorting by reversals, MIN-SBR. We use a standard reduction, i.e. the correspondence between permutations and breakpoints graphs used in the approximation algorithms for MIN-SRB (this approach was initiated by Bafna and Pevzner, <ref> [BP96] </ref>). In general, this correspondence is not approximation preserving because of so-called hurdles (see [BP96, HP95]). <p> We use a standard reduction, i.e. the correspondence between permutations and breakpoints graphs used in the approximation algorithms for MIN-SRB (this approach was initiated by Bafna and Pevzner, [BP96]). In general, this correspondence is not approximation preserving because of so-called hurdles (see <ref> [BP96, HP95] </ref>). <p> The basic reason is that all ACs of length 4 that may belong to a normalized solution (decomposition into ACs) form a single connected component in the interleaving graph (cf. <ref> [BP96, HP95] </ref>), because the number of longer cycles in a cover is O (n=log n), this implies that the total number of connected components of the interleaving graph is O (n=log n).

The core of the new method is the restricted version of the E2-LIN-2 problem studied in [H97]. <p> The reduction o 2 will replace each node of o 1 (G) with a small gadget. The next problem we consider is a breakpoint graph decomposition, BGD. This problem is related to maximum alternating cycle decomposition, (e.g. see Caprara, <ref> [C97] </ref>) but has a different objective function (as with another pair of related problems, node cover and independent set, the choice of the objective function affects approximability). <p> an instance of BGD with 2240n breakpoints has the minimum cost of an alternating cycle decomposition below (1236 + * 1 )n or above (1237 * 2 )n. 6 Reduction to MIN-SRB Our reduction from BGD to MIN-SRB is straightforward, in particular we can use the procedure GET-PERMUTATION of Caprara <ref> [C97, p.77] </ref> to obtain permutation (G) from a given breakpoint graph G. It is easy to show that if G is the result of reduction o 4 ffi o 1 applied to E2-LIN-2, then has o (n) hurdles.
