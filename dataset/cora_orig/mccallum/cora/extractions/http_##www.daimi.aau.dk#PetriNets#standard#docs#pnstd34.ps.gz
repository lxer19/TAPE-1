Title: High-level Petri Nets Concepts, Definitions and Graphical Notation  Editor's Foreword  
Date: October 2, 1997  
Address: 15909  
Note: Committee Draft ISO/IEC  Version 3.4  
Abstract: Previous drafts of this standard have been discussed in WG11 meetings during 1995 and 1996, and the Working Draft was circulated to SC7 member bodies in February 1997. This draft incorporates comments from the WG11 meeting in Walnut Creek in June 1997 which considered member body comments and those of Petri net experts in the wider community. This document is being circulated as a first CD to SC7 member bodies for comment and vote. The next meeting of WG11 will be in London, 3-7 November 1997. Although the deadline for the ballot will be after this meeting, it would be valuable to obtain comments from member bodies before the meeting if at all possible. It would therefore be appreciated if comments could be forwarded to the editor by 20 October 1997. National Bodies should send comments to the SC7 secretariat by email to sc7@QC.Bell.ca. WG11 experts may send their comments to the WG11 secretary, Mr Tony Williamson, at WILLIAMSONJA%AM5@mr.nawcad.navy.mil. It would be appreciated if these comments could also be copied to the editor, Jonathan Billington, at j.billington@unisa.edu.au. In formulating their vote, member bodies may wish to consider the symbols being used in the definition (clause 7). Currently the standard has used the symbol S for the set of places in a high-level net. This is because it originally came from the German stellen. Several countries would prefer to use P for the set of places, as it is more suggestive in a standard written in English. If P was used, this would allow S to be used for the set of Sorts (instead of R currently). The symbol F is used for the set of arcs, as historically, it has been called the flow relation. The use of A for the set of arcs is more suggestive. The symbol C is used for the Typing function as historically it was called the 'Colour' function. It would be more suggestive to use T ype instead. The greek letter Sigma has been used for signatures, but it is also used for summation. Replacing Sigma by Sig for a signature, would avoid this overloading. A greek letter (omega) has been used for the set of operators, and use of O is probably preferred. The use of f for functions is probably better than what is currently used (an italic w subscripted by H). F can be used for the
