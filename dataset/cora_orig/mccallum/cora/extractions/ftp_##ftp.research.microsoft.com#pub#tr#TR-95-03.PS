Reference-contexts: In the literature, many techniques for representing and indexing cases, generating solutions, and updating the database have been developed <ref> [11, 1] </ref>. In the approach described here, the database of previous cases is represented as a Bayesian network containing discrete variables [12]. The initial Bayesian network is constructed manually from an expert based on a set of past problem solving experiences.

Reference-contexts: Sets of synonymous technical terms are identified and the query is expanded. For example, in the test database, the terms "system error", "system trap", "blue screen", and "BSOD" are effectively merged in the search. Similar metods are used to deal with version numbers and the like <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It also can be viewed as constructing a graph that is equivalent to the union of a set of networks that would be constructed by the knowledge-based model construction algorithm developed by Breese, where each symptom in the network constructed in Step 1 is provisionally observed <ref> [3] </ref>. Breese's algorithm forward chains from hypotheses (in this case the issues already in the network) and determines at each step if a node has been observed.

Reference-contexts: In this formulation, we assume that there is a "noisy OR" relationship [12] between each symptom and the issues that cause it. This assumption makes both model assessment and inference more efficient <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. Updating of the Dirichlet distributions is described in Section 3.5. 3 The Troubleshooting Cycle The troubleshooting cycle is demand driven and consists of five basic steps: 1. Database Access: The text describing the problem is used to find potentially relevant symptoms or causes.

Reference-contexts: Heckerman et al. (1995) show that the optimal troubleshooting sequence under these assumptions is given by observing and possibly repairing causes in descending order of the ratio p i =c o i .

We have found this myopic approximation to yield good results in real-world problems <ref> [9] </ref>. 3.4 Execution Given the recommendations, the user performs one or more repairs or observations, and reports the results to the system. As additional variables are observed, it is necessary to reinvoke the model construction algorithm to extend the set of relevant causes, issues, and symptoms.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Most model-based [4] and probabilistic <ref> [10] </ref> methods for automated diagnosis use prespecified domain models as fundamental knowledge representations. The inference techniques used in these methods are powerful, but they rely on the availability of robust and relatively complete characterizations of potential problems, and have no explicit mechanism for feedback and learning from experience.

Cases are assumed to independent and identically distributed over some time horizon, and the uncertainty in parameters (i.e., long-run fractions) are encoded using Dirichlet distributions. <p> P r (S k jI j ) is the "leak" probability of symptom k given issue j is false.

Reference-contexts: In the current test database, each cause, symptom and resolution is accompanied by a textual description. A full-text information-retrieval algorithm, similar to that proposed by Salton <ref> [13] </ref>, is used to identify those causes or symptoms in the case database whose descriptions most closely match the textual problem description. The standard information-retrieval methods have been extended to deal with domain specific jargon and acronyms. Sets of synonymous technical terms are identified and the query is expanded.
