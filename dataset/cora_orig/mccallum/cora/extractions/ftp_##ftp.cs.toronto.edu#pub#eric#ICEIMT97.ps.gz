Abstract: Organizational and human issues are often crucial to the successful use of technology in organizations. Enterprise models that make these issues explicit can assist in analyzing issues, finding solutions, and in evaluating alternatives. This paper outlines the i* modelling framework, in which organizations and work processes are modelled in terms of dependency relationships among strategic actors.

Reference-contexts: A detailed analysis of strategic dependencies would suggest what relationships one should focus on when developing enterprise integration solutions. Fig. 2. Strategic Dependency model for alternative 1 Let the insurance agent handle it (adapted from a scenario described in <ref> [4] </ref> pp. 136-143). In this redesign, the insurance agent will do all the inquiry and payout, while the insurance company will concentrate on larger claims that have more significant impact on profitability. <p> In introducing enterprise integration solutions, designers should be careful not to merely automate existing processes. Innovative systems solutions often result from a more fundamental rethinking of business processes [3] and broader organizational issues [2]. In the auto insurance example described in <ref> [4] </ref>, the reengineering team wanted to consider radical solutions, by identifying a high-level goal: that claims be settled. Unencumbered by current business thinking about how this goal should be accomplished, the team arrived at innovative proposals that involve new strategic business relationships with insurance agents and body shops.

Reference-contexts: Contributions to softgoals can be positive or negative, and are judged to be adequate or inadequate.

By explicitly representing means-ends relationships, the Strategic Rationale model provides a systematic way for exploring the space of possible redesigns. <p> A formal analysis of the dependency network may not in itself offer useful conclusions, since the relative weights of the dependencies need to be taken into account.

Here, we distinguish among agents, roles, and positions. Agents occupy positions and play roles. A position usually covers a number of roles. Actor is the generic concept of which agent, role, and position are specializations.

Reference-contexts: Techniques such as functional decomposition and input-output analysis reduce complex systems into manageable subsystems. Organizational issues, however, often defy treatment by these conventional, systems-oriented techniques. For example, frameworks and technologies for enterprise integration (e.g., <ref> [7] </ref>) holds promise for achieving highly efficient and flexibile operations, overcoming barriers arising from the historical islands of technology. <p> This kind of modelling and analysis can be of considerable help in identifying enterprise integration solutions that can address the needs of organizations that have complex technical and human organizational environments. The modelling of strategic actor relationships is complementary to many existing enterprise modelling techniques <ref> [7] </ref>. Efforts are under way to relate the i fl framework to other models [10], and in particular, to agent-oriented specification languages and process simulation languages [15, 17]. Acknowledgements.
