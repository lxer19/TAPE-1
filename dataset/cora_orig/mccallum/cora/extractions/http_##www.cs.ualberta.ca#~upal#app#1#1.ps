Reference-contexts: This work has little to say about skill acquisition. However, 1970s marked a change for problem solving research into knowledge-rich domains such as chess [NS72] [de 78], mathematics [And82] [Gre78] physics [SS78] [LMSS80] [Chi81] [Anz91] computer programming [MRRH81] <ref> [AFS84] </ref> medical diagnosis [PGA90] [JDH + 81], the social sciences [VGPP83] and computer programming.

Reference-contexts: Research with the modern techniques have confirmed some of these earlier observations. A number of researchers who have studied the performance of brain damaged patients on problem solving tasks such as chess [NGP + 94], Tower of Hanoi/Tower of London [Sha82], arithmetic word problems <ref> [AGHC96] </ref> and maze tasks [KWZ91] have confirmed that performance of the subjects with damage to the frontal lobes was significantly worse than that of normal subjects. Shallice [Sha82] has proposed an information processing model to account for these observations.

Reference-contexts: During the early period, most of the problems studied were knowledge-poor problems such as the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. This work has little to say about skill acquisition. However, 1970s marked a change for problem solving research into knowledge-rich domains such as chess [NS72] [de 78], mathematics <ref> [And82] </ref> [Gre78] physics [SS78] [LMSS80] [Chi81] [Anz91] computer programming [MRRH81] [AFS84] medical diagnosis [PGA90] [JDH + 81], the social sciences [VGPP83] and computer programming.

Reference-contexts: The apprentice can try to correct her knowledge or ask the user for a hint. 4 Algorithms for Skill Acquisition Researchers have proposed various learning models to account for cognitive skill acquisition. Anderson's ACT theory <ref> [And83] </ref> and Newell's SOAR [New90] architecture are two theories based on production system that attempt to integrate problem solving and learning. An-derson has described a three step process for mastering problem solving skills.

Reference-contexts: A general model of cognitive skill acquisition must specify as to how an agent can learn from imperfect teachers and peers. If we carry out a rational analysis in the spirit of Anderson <ref> [And90] </ref> we can analyze the computational implications of relaxing the assumption of having one infallible teacher. I will call a learner to be a responsible learner if she can learn from an infallible teacher. A responsible learner must have (develop) the capability of judging goodness of a solution.

Apprenticeship has also been used as a metaphor in language development [Rog90] <ref> [Bru83] </ref> [Wel81] and career development of scientists [JS97]. Here we will discuss as to how apprenticeship can serve as a useful model for integration of problem solving and learning.

It was also noted that students learn better from examples than from teaching the general principles such as laws of physics [Van97]. Based on these findings researchers have argued that active apprenticeship is a better model of cognitive skill acquisition [VWC95].

Reference-contexts: Instead they suggest that it may be a result of goal-subgoal conflict resolution difficulties. Fletcher et al. <ref> [FBLB96] </ref> have also argued that poor performance of shunted hydrocephalus children on Tower of London task may be a result of their inability to pursue goal directed behavior.

Reference-contexts: Leiner et al. [LLD86] argue for an enhanced functionality of the cerebellum in cognitive skill acquisition and problem solving. However, much of it is based on speculation and it is hard to judge the plausibility or implausibility at this stage. Feiz et al. <ref> [FPC92] </ref> tested tested the performance of a cerebellar-lesion patient RC1 on Tower of Toronto puzzle (a simplified version of Tower of Hanoi). They observed that the patient performed worse than normal subjects.

Reference-contexts: Goel and Grafman 7 <ref> [GG95] </ref> has argued that poor performance on Tower of Hanoi task by frontal lobe damaged patients does not have to be a result of the deficits in 'planning' or 'look-ahead' abilities. Instead they suggest that it may be a result of goal-subgoal conflict resolution difficulties.

Reference-contexts: Although, frontal lobe damaged patients perform worse than normal patients in trying to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle they were eventually able to formulate the solution after prolonged effort. Following Grafman <ref> [Gra94] </ref> they suggest a modification in Shallice's model and suggest that frontal lobes may also play a role in retrieval of schemata. This explains as to why the performance would be affected on both kinds of tasks.

Reference-contexts: They do not specify as to how the learner incorporates the advice offered by the instructor or understands instructor's actions. Learning from others is rarely as simple as these models suggest. As Hayes-Roth <ref> [HKM81] </ref> points out, "more often than not, our initial efforts at carrying out someone's advice lead to several problems. We may fail to carry out the instructor's true wishes because we misunderstood the advice. We may err because our plans fail to work as we hoped.

Reference-contexts: The implication of that would be that a patient with damaged frontal lobe should not have any problem solving routine problems and should be unable to formulate the deliberate learning strategy to deal with a novel problems. However, in a recent study Godbout and Doyon <ref> [J.95] </ref> have shown that patients with frontal lobe damage do have problems solving both routine and novel problems. Although, frontal lobe damaged patients perform worse than normal patients in trying to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle they were eventually able to formulate the solution after prolonged effort.

The revival of problem solving research in the cognitive tradition began with the pioneering work of Newell and Simon [NS72]. They introduced theoretical concepts such as problem space and search trees.

Reference-contexts: Unlike CELIA which removes a piece of knowledge when it conflicts with the teacher a responsible learner can keep multiple hypothesis around until it is able to resolve them. Redmond [Red92] in the spirit of Reisbeck <ref> [KR86] </ref> has also emphasized the role of failures in identifying gaps in the student's knowledge in apprenticeship learning framework. Since he assumes that the teacher is infallible failures always result in the system revising its knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Leaving that line of criticism aside we also find CELIA's assumptions that (a) only one teacher is the source of all knowledge that arrives and (b) the teacher is infallible cognitively implausible. Modern educational theorists [Rog90] <ref> [McC96] </ref> propounding apprenticeship as a model of learning have emphasized teacher as a senior learner as opposed to the "master" in the traditional theories.

Redmond <ref> [Red94, Red92] </ref> has provided the most detailed model of apprenticeship learning to date. His model is implemented in a case-based reasoning program called CELIA that learns how to diagnose and fix car troubles. <p> Unlike CELIA which removes a piece of knowledge when it conflicts with the teacher a responsible learner can keep multiple hypothesis around until it is able to resolve them. Redmond <ref> [Red92] </ref> in the spirit of Reisbeck [KR86] has also emphasized the role of failures in identifying gaps in the student's knowledge in apprenticeship learning framework. Since he assumes that the teacher is infallible failures always result in the system revising its knowledge.

Reference-contexts: apprenticeship is a more appropriate metaphor for cognitive development in general as "apprentices learn to think, argue, act and interact in increasingly knowledgeable ways with people who do something well, by doing it with them as legitimate, peripheral participants." Apprenticeship has also been used as a metaphor in language development <ref> [Rog90] </ref> [Bru83] [Wel81] and career development of scientists [JS97]. Here we will discuss as to how apprenticeship can serve as a useful model for integration of problem solving and learning. <p> Leaving that line of criticism aside we also find CELIA's assumptions that (a) only one teacher is the source of all knowledge that arrives and (b) the teacher is infallible cognitively implausible.

Reference-contexts: Fletcher et al. [FBLB96] have also argued that poor performance of shunted hydrocephalus children on Tower of London task may be a result of their inability to pursue goal directed behavior. It is also interesting that Shallice's model makes references to Schank's <ref> [Sch82] </ref> theory of memory and intentional understanding on which our model of apprenticeship learning is also based. 6 Conclusion Although, the active apprentice model is useful as it obeys many constraints derived from problem solving research most of it is still speculative.

Reference-contexts: Research with the modern techniques have confirmed some of these earlier observations. A number of researchers who have studied the performance of brain damaged patients on problem solving tasks such as chess [NGP + 94], Tower of Hanoi/Tower of London <ref> [Sha82] </ref>, arithmetic word problems [AGHC96] and maze tasks [KWZ91] have confirmed that performance of the subjects with damage to the frontal lobes was significantly worse than that of normal subjects.

Shallice [Sha82] has proposed an information processing model to account for these observations. He suggests that in order to achieve a goal in a certain situation, it is necessary to select specific schemata (a complex series of actions associated with a task) appropriate for the situation.

Reference-contexts: Novices reason forward from facts to goals whereas experts reason backwards from goals to facts [Chi81]. 2 4. It was also noted that students learn better from examples than from teaching the general principles such as laws of physics <ref> [Van97] </ref>. Based on these findings researchers have argued that active apprenticeship is a better model of cognitive skill acquisition [VWC95]. <p> The type of problem also helps the student identify what learning method to employ. The apprenticeship learning is goal directed, deliberate and failure driven as cognitive theories of skill acquisition have suggested. However, when considered a psychological model of human skill acquisition, it has its limitations. As VanLehn <ref> [Van97] </ref> points out there is some evidence that process of self-explanation is not entirely analogy driven as many apprenticeship models assume.
