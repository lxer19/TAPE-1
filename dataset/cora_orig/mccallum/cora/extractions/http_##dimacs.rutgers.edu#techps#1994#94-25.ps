Reference-contexts: In [2], Foata-Schutzenberger produced an explicit bijection (i.e., the Foata-Schutzenberger correspondence) R k 0 for any partition and 0 satisfying (1) above.

Now Theorem 1.1 is immediate. We organize this note in the following way: in Section 2, we give the notations and the necessary background of this problem. <p> For example, if = (3; 1), then F = fl fl fl ! We recognize the right justification is not standard. The reason we do it is to include the parabolic boards as a special case. For details, see <ref> [1] </ref>. Let M (F ) be the set of all m by n complex matrices (a ij ) such that a ij = 0 for (i; j) =2 F . Let E ij 2 M (F ) be the matrix with 1 at (i; j) position and 0 elsewhere. <p> First, they introduced a numerical function on R k which is called the Garsia-Remmel function in <ref> [1] </ref>. Definition 2.2 For each 2 R k , put a dot in every cell of F which is above or to the right of a rook and put a circle in each of the remaining cells of F . Let GR () be the number of circles. <p> Remark. In [3], the authors called these polynomials the q-rook numbers. Clearly, this is a q-analogue of the rook number jR k j because R k (; 1) = jR k j: In <ref> [1] </ref>, Ding introduced another numerical function on R k , called the length function. <p> Definition 2.6 The rook length polynomials are defined by RL k (; q) = 2R k q l () ; k 0: Clearly, this is another q-analogue of jR k j. It was shown in <ref> [1] </ref> that there is a very simple relation between Garsia-Remmel polynomials and rook length polynomials. <p> A 0 = B 0 = C 0 = y 1 Put these four pieces together, we have (3; 3)() = 1 1 4 Proof of Theorem 2.10 In <ref> [1] </ref>, there is a very simple formula to evaluate the length function l. Theorem 4.1 Let 2 R r such that = P r i=1 E x i ;y i and x 1 &lt; x 2 &lt; &lt; x r .

Reference-contexts: The purpose of this note is to give such a proof. Our idea is roughly as follows. In <ref> [2] </ref>, Foata-Schutzenberger produced an explicit bijection (i.e., the Foata-Schutzenberger correspondence) R k 0 for any partition and 0 satisfying (1) above. On the other hand, Ding showed that there is a natural way to associate a "length" l () to any 2 R k [1]. <p> ~ F 0 , i.e., F ~ F 0 if and only if f (; x) = f ( 0 ; x) if and only if jR k 0 j; 8k : In 1970, Foata and Schutzenberger introduced a very powerful construction which was called "(k; k 0 ) -transform" <ref> [2] </ref> and we will call these transforms Foata-Schutzenberger correspondences. By means of these correspondences, Foata and Schutzenberger classified Ferrers boards according to rook polynomials as follows. Theorem 2.1 Every Ferrers board is rook equivalent to a unique increasing Ferrers board.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Given any partition and any non-negative integer k, let R k denote the set of non-attacking rook placements involving k rooks on the Ferrers board F , and let R k (; q) denote the Garsia-Remmel q-rook polynomial in the variable q as introduced in <ref> [3] </ref> (see Definition 2.5). <p> Here, a Ferrers board is said to be increasing if the heights of the columns from left to right increase strictly. - 3 - In 1986, Garsia and Remmel considered a q-analogue of the rook number jR k j <ref> [3] </ref>. First, they introduced a numerical function on R k which is called the Garsia-Remmel function in [1]. <p> Usually, we use a 1 to represent a rook as shown above. Definition 2.4 The Garsia-Remmel q-rook polynomials are defined by R k (; q) = 2R k q GR () ; k 0: where GR () is as in Definition 2.2. Remark. In <ref> [3] </ref>, the authors called these polynomials the q-rook numbers. Clearly, this is a q-analogue of the rook number jR k j because R k (; 1) = jR k j: In [1], Ding introduced another numerical function on R k , called the length function.

Reference-contexts: A k-rook placement on F is an assignment of k rooks on F in non-attacking positions. The rook polynomial of the Ferrers board F is defined by f (; x) = k=0 j x k : In his book on combinatorial analysis <ref> [4] </ref>, Riordan gave a survey on the early development of the theory of rook polynomials.
