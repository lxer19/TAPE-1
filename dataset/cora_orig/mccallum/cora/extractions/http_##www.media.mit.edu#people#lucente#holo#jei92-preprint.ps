Abstract: Several methods of increasing the speed and simplicity of the computation of off-axis transmission holograms are presented, with applications to the real-time display of holographic images. The bipolar intensity approach allows for the real-valued linear summation of interference fringes, a factor of 2 speed increase, and the elimination of image noise caused by object self-interference. An order of magnitude speed increase is obtained through the use of a precomputed look-up table containing a large array of elemental interference patterns corresponding to point source contributions from each of the possible locations in image space. Results achieved using a data-parallel supercomputer to compute horizontal-parallax-only holographic patterns containing 6 megasamples indicate that an image comprised of 10,000 points with arbitrary brightness (gray scale) can be computed in under 1 second. Implemented on a common workstation, the look-up table approach increases computation speed by a factor of 43.

In the first generation MIT system, the data content (space-bandwidth product) of the CGH was as low as 2 Mbytes <ref> [2] </ref>. In optical holography [8], the object light and the reference light are incident at the plane of the hologram, represented with spatially varying complex time-harmonic electric field vectors, E O and E R . It is assumed that both are mutually coherent sources of monochromatic light.

Reference-contexts: However, the numerical synthesis of a holographic interference pattern requires an enormous amount of computation, making rapid (~1 s) generation of holograms of even limited size impossible with conventional computers. A holographic fringe pattern is computed by numerically simulating the physical phenomena of light diffraction and interference <ref> [4] </ref>. Computation of holographic interference patterns often utilizes the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. Though relatively fast for images composed of discrete depth surfaces [5, 6], this approach becomes slow when applied to images that extend throughout an image volume.

Reference-contexts: For a horizontal sampling pitch of 1=d, the maximum spatial frequency (f max ) that can be represented is 1=2d, according to the Nyquist Sampling Theorem. Higher spatial frequencies cause aliasing and destroy image quality. In addition to providing anti-aliasing, "(x) is used for the purposes of image occlusion <ref> [9] </ref> and advanced image lighting models, resulting in a more realistic looking image.

Reference-contexts: No reference beam ratio needs to be specified during computation, and bias buildup is not an issue. Compare this bipolar intensity method to the physical process occurring in some photorefractive crystals <ref> [10] </ref> (e.g., lithium niobate), in which uniform (dc) intensity is not recorded due to the material's negligible response to intensity patterns with low spatial frequencies. Researchers exploit this absence of bias build-up in order to sequentially expose multiple holographic intensity patterns.

Reference-contexts: However, this is a common case, and is applicable to many display architectures. As demonstrated in Section 6, this contraction of rank is especially useful when implemented on a standard serial-processing computer. Application to the Computation of Stereograms For some applications, a stereogram <ref> [11] </ref> approach may be desirable when presenting 3-D images. In general, a stereogram consists of a series of 2-D object views differing in horizontal point-of-view.
