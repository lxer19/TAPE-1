Reference-contexts: They use Fourier transforms to give an eigenanalysis of the linear subdivision map to find conditions on the scheme that guarantee convergence to a tangent plane smooth surface at extraordinary vertices. In a previous paper <ref> [1] </ref>, these authors take a direct matrix approach to the eigenanalysis. Halstead, Kass, and DeRose [12] present an eigenanalysis that can be applied to any stationary subdivision map and suggest sufficient conditions for its convergence and for the existence of a well-defined tangent plane at extraordinary points. <p> Let the B-spline control points be designated by P j , for j = 0; 1; : : : ; m. Their limit points will correspond to parameter values u = j=m for the entire curve, u 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. A single Bezier segment has a support of 4 consecutive control points, which we write in the array P j = (P j1 ; P j ,P j+1 ; P j+2 ) T . <p> A polynomial segment of the B-spline curve can then be represented as C j (t) = Bseg (t) P j ; where t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and Bseg (t) represents the basis function for that segment. Figure 2.7 illustrates the placement of this curve segment in the control net. We can compute the basis function Bseg (t), as follows. <p> We have: A = (1=6) B B B B 1 4 1 0 0 2 4 0 1 C C C A Let Bern (3) (t) be the array of the degree 3 Bernstein polynomials for t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>: Bern (3) (t) = ((1 t) 3 ; 3 (1 t) 2 t; 3 (1 t)t 2 ; t 3 ): Then we can compute the basis function as Bseg (t) = Bern (3) (t) A: We note that for a uniform B-spline curve, the same basis function Bseg <p> Since the end points of this subdivision curve are fixed, we have values for Curve (0) and Curve (1). Thus, we have shown that Curve (u) can be evaluated for every real u 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Further analysis of the subdivision scheme would be needed to tell whether Curve (u) is continuous and differentiable at u = 0 and u = 1. <p> That is, we find control points for the boundary subdivision curves. If fP i g n i=1 are the given data points for one boundary curve, we find control points fX j g m j=0 for a subdivision curve C (u), for u 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, so that the P i are within an error bound of C (u i ), for some parameter values u i . In Section 2.2.1 we showed how C (u) can be evaluated. <p> Although these techniques had been developed in the context of the symmetrical subdivision rules for smooth surfaces <ref> [1, 12, 27] </ref>, we were able to extend them for use on our asymmetrical rules for creases and corners.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, conventional methods of analyzing surfaces are inadequate, since they depend on representations such as polynomial or rational functions. Determining whether the limit subdivision surface is well defined and tangent plane continuous has become the subject of more recent research <ref> [2, 27] </ref>. There are also techniques for deriving exact formulas for points and normals on the limit surfaces [12]. The elegant simplicity and practical advantages of subdivision algorithms have made them useful for particular applications. <p> With various degrees of formality, these authors have given arguments that their schemes converge to tangent plane smooth surfaces at all points. In particular, Doo and Sabin and Loop apply Fourier analysis, taking advantage of the cyclic nature of their schemes. Ball and Storry <ref> [2] </ref> provide a more in-depth treatment of schemes on a rectangular mesh. They use Fourier transforms to give an eigenanalysis of the linear subdivision map to find conditions on the scheme that guarantee convergence to a tangent plane smooth surface at extraordinary vertices.

Reference-contexts: While they can be used to model smooth objects, they can also be extended to model objects with boundaries and sharp features [13]. Subdivision schemes that generalize B-spline representations <ref> [4, 8, 17, 13] </ref> are particularly useful.

Subdivision schemes for surfaces were first introduced by Catmull and Clark <ref> [4] </ref> and by Doo and Sabin [8] in 1978. They generalized bicubic and biquadratic B-splines, respectively, to achieve surfaces of arbitrary topological type by introducing irregu 3 larities in a rectangular control mesh. In 1987, Loop [17] presented his scheme that generalizes quartic triangular B-splines (also known as quartic Box-splines). <p> Loop's scheme (and the piecewise smooth scheme that generalizes it) accommodates extraordinary vertices in a triangular mesh. In fact, these surfaces generalize G 2 quartic Box-splines [13, 17]. Some other schemes that accommodate extraordinary vertices are Doo-Sabin [8], which generalizes biquadratic B-spline surfaces and Catmull-Clark <ref> [4] </ref>, which generalizes bicubic B-splines. The advantage of these schemes is that in regions away from the extraordinary vertices, the surfaces they generate are B-splines, which can be represented as piecewise polynomials in those regions. We will discuss this in more detail in the next section.

Reference-contexts: See Cavaretta, Dahmen and Micchelli <ref> [5] </ref>, for example. However, these schemes apply only to regular meshes, where the same subdivision rule can be applied at each vertex, edge, or face. In fact, early surface subdivision schemes were motivated by the need to define surfaces over non-regular control meshes.

He gives particular attention to a control mesh with a boundary and assures that the resulting surface boundary interpolates quadratic B-splines. In [22], Nasri extends this work to generate surfaces that interpolate normal vectors. <p> Loop's scheme (and the piecewise smooth scheme that generalizes it) accommodates extraordinary vertices in a triangular mesh.

Reference-contexts: All of the schemes mentioned so far result in surfaces that approximate their control mesh, but the techniques for analyzing them can also be applied to subdivision schemes that interpolate the vertices in a control mesh. For example, the interpola-tory subdivision surface of Dyn, Levin, and Gregory's Butterfly scheme <ref> [9] </ref> has been found to achieve tangent plane smoothness at vertices of valences between 4 and 7, but is not G 1 at a valence 3 vertex. <p> However, there are also subdivision schemes that create surfaces that interpolate the points of the mesh. The butterfly scheme of Dyn, Levin, and Gregory <ref> [9] </ref> is an example of an interpolating subdivision scheme that models objects of arbitrary topological type. It is useful to define a neighborhood of a vertex in a mesh. The 1-neighborhood of a vertex is the part of the mesh consisting of the vertex and its nearest neighbor vertices.

(See Farin <ref> [10] </ref>.) If the control points are radially ordered, then no line from the origin can intersect the control polygon more than once. If the curve doubled back, then a line from the origin through that point would intersect the curve and hence its control polygon more than once.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Subdivision curves and surfaces are valued in geometric modeling applications for their convenience and flexibility. They permit the representation of objects of arbitrary topological type in a form that is easy to design, render and manipulate <ref> [12, 25] </ref>. While they can be used to model smooth objects, they can also be extended to model objects with boundaries and sharp features [13]. Subdivision schemes that generalize B-spline representations [4, 8, 17, 13] are particularly useful. <p> Determining whether the limit subdivision surface is well defined and tangent plane continuous has become the subject of more recent research [2, 27]. There are also techniques for deriving exact formulas for points and normals on the limit surfaces <ref> [12] </ref>. The elegant simplicity and practical advantages of subdivision algorithms have made them useful for particular applications. For example, they are ideal for quickly ren 2 dering an object where a piecewise planar model suffices. <p> Subdivision surfaces are also making fundamental contributions to new application areas in geometric modeling. For example, they are a key element in the multires-olution representation of objects [18], and they are a convenient representation for optimized surface fitting <ref> [12, 16] </ref>. In this dissertation, we examine two topics related to subdivision surfaces. First, we show how a piecewise smooth subdivision scheme can be analyzed, and we derive formulas for points and tangents on the limit surface. <p> In a previous paper [1], these authors take a direct matrix approach to the eigenanalysis. Halstead, Kass, and DeRose <ref> [12] </ref> present an eigenanalysis that can be applied to any stationary subdivision map and suggest sufficient conditions for its convergence and for the existence of a well-defined tangent plane at extraordinary points. They also show how formulas for the limit points and normals can be derived from the eigenstructure. <p> He gives particular attention to a control mesh with a boundary and assures that the resulting surface boundary interpolates quadratic B-splines. In [22], Nasri extends this work to generate surfaces that interpolate normal vectors. Halstead, Kass, and DeRose <ref> [12] </ref> describe a method for constructing a smooth subdivision surface that uses the Catmull-Clark scheme and interpolates input data points and normals. To achieve a fair surface, they minimize an energy function that seeks to penalize sharp variations in curvature. <p> Sufficient conditions for convergence are: * There must a single largest eigenvalue, 0 = 1. * Its corresponding right eigenvector must be R 0 = (1; 1; : : : ; 1). 26 It can be shown <ref> [8, 12] </ref> that the limit point is V 1 n X l i V i ; where L 0 = (l 0 ; l 1 ; : : : ; l n ) is the dominant left eigenvector, normalized so that l 0 + l 1 + : : : + <p> It has been suggested <ref> [8, 12] </ref> that conditions on the sub-dominant eigenvalues are sufficient for this, but Reif [27] gives evidence that a stronger criterion is needed. His criterion is that the characteristic map for the subdivision rule be regular, that is, have a non-vanishing Jacobian. <p> 0 is V 1 and the limiting tangent space at that point is spanned by the vectors ~v 1 = L 1 M 0 and ~v 2 = L 2 M 0 : 47 Allowing 1 &gt; 2 is an extension to the conditions presented previously by Halstead et al. <ref> [12] </ref> and Reif [27]. We suggest that equality of these sub-dominant eigenvalues is a consequence of the symmetry of the scheme rather than a requirement for the existence of a limiting tangent plane. We now give some explanation for making this extension. <p> As described in Halstead et al. <ref> [12] </ref>, the thin plate energy norm for a surface patch S can be written as E (S) = 0 0 (kS xx k 2 + 2kS xy k 2 + kS yy k 2 )dxdy; where, for example, S xx is the second partial derivative of S with respect to x. <p> See also Figure 2.11. We can use this idea to evaluate the energy on a patch because the thin plate energy is calculated from the energies of the sub-patches as E (patch) = 4 4 X E (subpatch i ): (See Halstead et al. <ref> [12] </ref>.) Thus, we can calculate the energy norm for these extraordinary patches by repeated subdivision and summing the energies of their ordinary sub-patches. We find, however, that for extraordinary patches this sum diverges in the limit. Halstead et al. [12] discuss a solution to this problem and show how to derive <p> 4 4 X E (subpatch i ): (See Halstead et al. <ref> [12] </ref>.) Thus, we can calculate the energy norm for these extraordinary patches by repeated subdivision and summing the energies of their ordinary sub-patches. We find, however, that for extraordinary patches this sum diverges in the limit. Halstead et al. [12] discuss a solution to this problem and show how to derive an expression for the energy for an extraordinary patch. A simplification is to approximate the energy by taking only a few terms in this series. <p> We mentioned that our method for calculating the energy norm for extraordinary patches results in a divergent series. Our current implementation takes a few terms in th sum of energies from sub-patches. We abandoned the alternative implementation that is based on the scheme in Halstead et al. <ref> [12] </ref> because the values we obtained were large enough to give numerical difficulties in our software environment. Perhaps 125 a different implementation would iron out this difficulty. Our mesh construction made it possible to avoid the case where extraordinary vertices lie on the boundary (other than at the corners). <p> Although these techniques had been developed in the context of the symmetrical subdivision rules for smooth surfaces <ref> [1, 12, 27] </ref>, we were able to extend them for use on our asymmetrical rules for creases and corners.

Reference-contexts: They permit the representation of objects of arbitrary topological type in a form that is easy to design, render and manipulate [12, 25]. While they can be used to model smooth objects, they can also be extended to model objects with boundaries and sharp features <ref> [13] </ref>. Subdivision schemes that generalize B-spline representations [4, 8, 17, 13] are particularly useful. Although B-spline (and NURB) surface representations are a prevalent representation in geometric modeling, they cannot model objects of non-planar topology or objects possessing sharp features without cumbersome patch stitching and curve trimming. <p> While they can be used to model smooth objects, they can also be extended to model objects with boundaries and sharp features [13]. Subdivision schemes that generalize B-spline representations <ref> [4, 8, 17, 13] </ref> are particularly useful. Although B-spline (and NURB) surface representations are a prevalent representation in geometric modeling, they cannot model objects of non-planar topology or objects possessing sharp features without cumbersome patch stitching and curve trimming. <p> This symmetry makes sense for vertices in the interior of a mesh where a uniformly smooth surface is desired. However, a scheme that proposes to treat boundaries or introduce irregularities in curvature or smoothness must allow more asymmetry in its rules. The piecewise smooth scheme of Hoppe et al. <ref> [13] </ref> does just that in order to introduce sharp features. We note that this lack of symmetry diminishes the applicability of Fourier transforms, as used by Ball and Storry, to the analysis of the piecewise smooth scheme. <p> This method involves the eigenstructure of the local subdivision matrix. * Reconstruction of objects from samples of 3D data Hoppe et al.'s work <ref> [13, 14, 15, 16] </ref> provides for the accurate reconstruction of an object from a dense, uniform sampling of 3D data points on its surface. The resulting piecewise smooth surface is represented using a subdivision scheme that generalizes Loop's. <p> The subdivision rules that we analyze do not exhibit the full symmetry of those that have been previously analyzed. Therefore, our analysis provides a more general framework for examining a subdivision scheme. We accomplish the following specific tasks for the piecewise smooth subdivision scheme described in Hoppe et al. <ref> [13] </ref>. * We give sufficient conditions for a possible asymmetrical subdivision scheme to converge to a well-defined surface with a regular G 1 parameterization. This includes conditions on the eigenstructure of the local subdivision matrices along with a criterion on the characteristic maps that we adapt from Reif's analysis [27]. <p> A vertex whose valence adheres to the regular restriction is called ordinary; otherwise it is called extraordinary. Loop's scheme (and the piecewise smooth scheme that generalizes it) accommodates extraordinary vertices in a triangular mesh. In fact, these surfaces generalize G 2 quartic Box-splines <ref> [13, 17] </ref>. Some other schemes that accommodate extraordinary vertices are Doo-Sabin [8], which generalizes biquadratic B-spline surfaces and Catmull-Clark [4], which generalizes bicubic B-splines. <p> We illustrate the connection by using a particular type of subdivision curve that is a restricted case of the "crease curves" generated in Hoppe et al. <ref> [13] </ref> for creases. We use these particular curves in Chapter 4 as the boundary curves of the surfaces created by the algorithm presented there. B-spline Curves It has long been known that B-spline curves can be created using subdivision of a control polygon [3, 7, 10]. <p> This particular curve will coincide with the boundary curves used for the surfaces in Chapter 4 and is a restricted version of the crease and boundary curves generated by the piecewise smooth subdivision scheme of Hoppe et al. <ref> [13] </ref>. In Chapter 3, we show that the rules for creating creases in that scheme can be uncoupled to simply create a subdivision curve. The subdivision mask 1-6-1 is applied to all vertices that are not end points. <p> In his analysis [27], Reif states their equality as a requirement, but his arguments can be extended to include the case where 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 . In Chapter 3 we use this fact as we analyze the asymmetric schemes described in Hoppe et al. <ref> [13] </ref> for creating creases and corners. 2.3.4 Formulas for Tangent Vectors Formulas for tangent vectors at V 1 0 are found by using the left eigenvectors corresponding to the two sub-dominant eigenvalues 1 ; 2 . <p> Chapter 3 ANALYSIS OF PIECEWISE SMOOTH SUBDIVISION SURFACES In this chapter, we describe our results in analyzing properties of piecewise smooth subdivision surfaces. We use the subdivision scheme described in Hoppe, et al. <ref> [13] </ref> for creating piecewise smooth surfaces. This scheme is an extension of Loop surfaces. Loop introduced extraordinary points by generalizing the subdivision rules that yield quartic Box-splines. Hoppe, et al. introduced the sharp features: darts, creases, and corners. <p> Chapter 4 AN APPLICATION OF SUBDIVISION SURFACES In the interest of widening the application of subdivision surfaces, we investigate a problem motivated by engineering practice. We address the reconstruction of an object from non-uniformly sampled 3D data. Hoppe et al. <ref> [13] </ref> have created subdivision surfaces that approximate objects that have been sampled densely and uniformly. Costs associated with this data requirement include sampling time and expense, data processing, and the computer time to run the reconstruction algorithm [16]. The difficulty of obtaining uniform samples from complex objects poses another problem. <p> We show one more planar mesh using an octagonal boundary in Figure 4.16. These examples also illustrate the sharp corners on the boundary. This is an extended capability to the boundaries of Hoppe et al. <ref> [13] </ref>. In that work, all boundaries of smooth regions are treated as a single smooth crease curve. 4.7.3 Examples Showing Fitting Plus Fairing We now add a central interior point to the first example and show the resulting surface that is fit to it. See Figure 4.13.

For example, they are a key element in the multires-olution representation of objects [18], and they are a convenient representation for optimized surface fitting <ref> [12, 16] </ref>. In this dissertation, we examine two topics related to subdivision surfaces. First, we show how a piecewise smooth subdivision scheme can be analyzed, and we derive formulas for points and tangents on the limit surface. <p> This method involves the eigenstructure of the local subdivision matrix. * Reconstruction of objects from samples of 3D data Hoppe et al.'s work <ref> [13, 14, 15, 16] </ref> provides for the accurate reconstruction of an object from a dense, uniform sampling of 3D data points on its surface. The resulting piecewise smooth surface is represented using a subdivision scheme that generalizes Loop's. <p> Hoppe et al. [13] have created subdivision surfaces that approximate objects that have been sampled densely and uniformly. Costs associated with this data requirement include sampling time and expense, data processing, and the computer time to run the reconstruction algorithm <ref> [16] </ref>. The difficulty of obtaining uniform samples from complex objects poses another problem. For example, the physical dimensions of a scanner may make it impossible to reach certain regions such as in holes or pockets. There may also be regions that are occluded from the view of a scanner.

Reference-contexts: While they can be used to model smooth objects, they can also be extended to model objects with boundaries and sharp features [13]. Subdivision schemes that generalize B-spline representations <ref> [4, 8, 17, 13] </ref> are particularly useful. Although B-spline (and NURB) surface representations are a prevalent representation in geometric modeling, they cannot model objects of non-planar topology or objects possessing sharp features without cumbersome patch stitching and curve trimming. <p> Subdivision schemes for surfaces were first introduced by Catmull and Clark [4] and by Doo and Sabin [8] in 1978. They generalized bicubic and biquadratic B-splines, respectively, to achieve surfaces of arbitrary topological type by introducing irregu 3 larities in a rectangular control mesh. In 1987, Loop <ref> [17] </ref> presented his scheme that generalizes quartic triangular B-splines (also known as quartic Box-splines). With various degrees of formality, these authors have given arguments that their schemes converge to tangent plane smooth surfaces at all points. <p> A vertex whose valence adheres to the regular restriction is called ordinary; otherwise it is called extraordinary. Loop's scheme (and the piecewise smooth scheme that generalizes it) accommodates extraordinary vertices in a triangular mesh. In fact, these surfaces generalize G 2 quartic Box-splines <ref> [13, 17] </ref>. Some other schemes that accommodate extraordinary vertices are Doo-Sabin [8], which generalizes biquadratic B-spline surfaces and Catmull-Clark [4], which generalizes bicubic B-splines. <p> We will use this relationship in Chapters 3 and 4 when we compute properties of the piecewise smooth subdivision surfaces. 21 P4 P5 P6 P7 P11 P12 Box-splines Analogous to B-spline curves, Box-spline surfaces can be generated using subdivision of a control net <ref> [17] </ref>. The refinement masks for uniform quartic Box-splines are as in A quartic Box-spline surface is composed of triangular quartic Bezier patches.

Rather than taking the closest control point for each data point, we could use an orthogonal projection onto the boundary curves or surface.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Subdivision curves and surfaces are valued in geometric modeling applications for their convenience and flexibility. They permit the representation of objects of arbitrary topological type in a form that is easy to design, render and manipulate <ref> [12, 25] </ref>. While they can be used to model smooth objects, they can also be extended to model objects with boundaries and sharp features [13]. Subdivision schemes that generalize B-spline representations [4, 8, 17, 13] are particularly useful. <p> We take advantage of Mathematica's high-level interface and numerical tools, and we use its graphics capabilities to display meshes. A disadvantage in using Mathematica is slow performance for large meshes. The pictures of limit surfaces are displayed using a subdivision surface viewer written by Kari Pulli <ref> [25] </ref>. They are simply shown with flat shading. 114 4.7.2 Simple Examples Showing Mesh Construction and Fairing We illustrate the mesh construction by showing the results for some simple sets of boundary data. Our first example uses the sides of an equilateral triangle for three boundary curves.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, conventional methods of analyzing surfaces are inadequate, since they depend on representations such as polynomial or rational functions. Determining whether the limit subdivision surface is well defined and tangent plane continuous has become the subject of more recent research <ref> [2, 27] </ref>. There are also techniques for deriving exact formulas for points and normals on the limit surfaces [12]. The elegant simplicity and practical advantages of subdivision algorithms have made them useful for particular applications. <p> They also show how formulas for the limit points and normals can be derived from the eigenstructure. Reif <ref> [27] </ref> points out that these analyses do not give adequate conditions to sufficiently guarantee smoothness and to rule out self-intersections of the surface at extraordinary vertices. He presents a technique for proving that the limit surface has a regular G 1 parameterization near the extraordinary point. <p> This includes conditions on the eigenstructure of the local subdivision matrices along with a criterion on the characteristic maps that we adapt from Reif's analysis <ref> [27] </ref>. <p> We encode the subdivision rules in matrices and show how their eigenstructure provides information about the limit surface. We also introduce the technique of characteristic maps developed by Urlich Reif <ref> [27] </ref> for proving smoothness of a subdivision surface at extraordinary points. 2.3.1 Local Subdivision Matrices The subdivision process can be represented using matrix operations because the subdivision rules are linear combinations of the mesh vertices. <p> It has been suggested [8, 12] that conditions on the sub-dominant eigenvalues are sufficient for this, but Reif <ref> [27] </ref> gives evidence that a stronger criterion is needed. His criterion is that the characteristic map for the subdivision rule be regular, that is, have a non-vanishing Jacobian. We will defer discussion of that map for now and discuss the condition on the eigenstructure. <p> The schemes of Doo-Sabin, Catmull-Clark, and Loop all treat the edges about a vertex with the same rule. For these symmetric schemes, the sub-dominant eigenvalues 1 and 2 are equal. In his analysis <ref> [27] </ref>, Reif states their equality as a requirement, but his arguments can be extended to include the case where 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 . <p> To guarantee this, we must show that the surface has a regular G 1 parameterization at those points. This is the task of the 2D characteristic maps that are defined by Reif <ref> [27] </ref>. He proves that if the characteristic map of a subdivision rule is regular and injective, then the surface is regular at the vertices where that rule is applied. Without justification, we can give a constructive definition of the characteristic map for a subdivision rule. <p> To achieve these goals, we will apply the two key analysis techniques that we introduced in Section 2.3, namely, eigenanalysis of local subdivision matrices and construction and analysis of characteristic maps adapted from those defined by Reif <ref> [27] </ref>. 46 These methods were developed in the context of the symmetric rules for generating smooth surfaces, such as the schemes of Doo-Sabin and Catmull-Clark. As such, these methods apply to the rules (Loop's) for smooth vertices in the piecewise smooth scheme. <p> 1 and the limiting tangent space at that point is spanned by the vectors ~v 1 = L 1 M 0 and ~v 2 = L 2 M 0 : 47 Allowing 1 &gt; 2 is an extension to the conditions presented previously by Halstead et al. [12] and Reif <ref> [27] </ref>. We suggest that equality of these sub-dominant eigenvalues is a consequence of the symmetry of the scheme rather than a requirement for the existence of a limiting tangent plane. We now give some explanation for making this extension. <p> Therefore, all the s k are regular G 1 50 surfaces except at V 1 0 , so at each of the points p k , the surface has continuous first partial derivatives with non-zero Jacobian. Reif <ref> [27] </ref> proves that the regularity and injectivity of the characteristic map is necessary for this assumption. <p> (X (p 0 ) R i ) m i ~y 0 = (Y (p 0 ) R 2 ) m 2 + i=3 We can assume that the coefficients of m 1 and m 2 are both non-zero by the regularity of the surface at p 0 . (See Reif <ref> [27] </ref>.) We assume that m 1 and m 2 are linearly independent in IR 3 because the control points in M 0 are in general position. <p> This is guaranteed by the conditions stated at 52 the beginning of this section, if we can apply Reif's theorem <ref> [27] </ref>, which says that the regularity and injectivity of the characteristic map (defined on a neighborhood near the extraordinary point) implies the regularity of the surface at the extraordinary point. <p> By designing our rule to have this eigenstructure, we have chosen to have a vertex where the space of limiting tangents is of dimension 3. This is what we desire for a singularity that behaves like the tip of a cone. (Reif <ref> [27] </ref> shows that if 1 = 2 , then it is necessary for 1 = 2 &gt; 3 for a well-defined tangent plane.) We can experiment with values for a=b and get a range of surface types. When we take b = 0, we get a cusp-like type of singularity. <p> Although these techniques had been developed in the context of the symmetrical subdivision rules for smooth surfaces <ref> [1, 12, 27] </ref>, we were able to extend them for use on our asymmetrical rules for creases and corners. <p> In particular, we extended the sufficient conditions for a regular G 1 surface at an extraordinary (smooth, crease, or corner) point by allowing unequal sub-dominant eigenvalues and by adapting the characteristic maps of Reif <ref> [27] </ref> to the asymmetrical crease and corner neighborhoods. 130 To verify that these conditions are fulfilled for the smooth, crease, and corner rules, we derived formulas (for general valence n) for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of their local subdivision matrices, and devised an algorithm that generates their characteristic map (for a
