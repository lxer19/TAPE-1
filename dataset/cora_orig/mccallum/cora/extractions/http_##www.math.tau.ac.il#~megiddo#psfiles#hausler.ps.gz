Abstract: It is NP-complete to recognize whether two sets of points in general space can be separated by two hyperplanes. It is NP-complete to recognize whether two sets of points in the plane can be separated with k lines. For every fixed k in any fixed dimension, it takes polynomial time to recognize whether two sets of points can be separated with k hyperplanes.

Reference-contexts: When two sets cannot be separated by a hyperplane, a natural problem is to find the minimum number of hyperplanes that is required for the separation.

Reference-contexts: Also, [ABOSY] deals with the problem of separating two nested convex polygons by a polygon with a minimum number of edges. The problem of separating two sets of points in R 2 by a circle was first considered in <ref> [KA] </ref>. It turns that separability of two sets of points in R d by a sphere can be decided in linear time if d is fixed [OKM], using methods like the one in [M1, M2].

Reference-contexts: We now discuss the complexity of separability in the plane. We are interested in recognizing whether two sets of points in the plane can be separated by k straight lines. A related problem was considered in <ref> [MT] </ref>: Problem (Point Covering) . Given a finite set of points in the plane and a number k, recognize whether there exist k straight lines such that each point lies on at least one of the lines. The point covering problem was shown in [MT] to be NP-complete. <p> A related problem was considered in <ref> [MT] </ref>: Problem (Point Covering) . Given a finite set of points in the plane and a number k, recognize whether there exist k straight lines such that each point lies on at least one of the lines. The point covering problem was shown in [MT] to be NP-complete. The proof can be adapted to establish the following: Proposition 4. The problem of recognizing whether two sets of points in the plane are separable by k lines is NP-complete. <p> Proposition 3 hints that the point covering problem is closely related to the separation problem with k lines. The construction here is in a sense an adaptation of the construction of <ref> [MT] </ref>. The 5 reduction is from the 3-satisfiability problem. <p> A satisfying assignment corresponds to the choice of type of lines for each of the "grids". It is shown in <ref> [MT] </ref> that the locations can be constructed so that their coordinates are bounded by a polynomial in m and n. So far we have essentially repeated the reduction of 3-satisfiability to point covering. For the separability problem we do as follows.
