Abstract: We are experimenting with an approach to connectionist speech recognition that models the dynamics within a speech segment using temporal position as an explicit variable. Currently, the most common model for human speech production that is used in speech recognition is the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). However, HMMs suffer from well known limitations; most notably, the assumption that the observations generated in a given state are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). As an alternative, we are developing a time index model that explicitly conditions the emission probability of a state on the time index, where time index is defined as the number of frames since entering a state till the current frame. Thus, the proposed model does not require the i.i.d. assumption. Our pilot results suggest that the time-index approach can greatly reduce error if we have good information about the phoneme boundary location.

Reference-contexts: The production of the acoustic vectors in a segment may be described as a three step procedure <ref> [1] </ref>: 1. Generate a fixed length segment M according to the distribution P (y 1 ; y 2 ; : : : ; y M js k ), where s k is a particular speech unit. The distribution models the trajectory of the sound in the feature vector space.

Reference-contexts: This transformation can be either linear or non linear depending on the specific segmental model. Stochastic segment models are not inherently subject to the constraints of the i.i.d. assumptions discussed earlier. An early stochastic segment model was developed by Ostendorf and Roukos <ref> [2] </ref>. A later model was introduced by Ghitza and Sondhi [3]. However, there are some practical difficulties: 1.

Reference-contexts: One solution would be to assume a parametric form for the trajectory, as was done by Deng. In our case, we have chosen to use a multilayer perceptron (MLP) approach, which in our previous work at ICSI, has proved useful for such estimates <ref> [5] </ref>. 3 The Time Index Model Implementation and Experiments 3.1 An Implementation of the Time Index Model In our model we define the emission probability of a state as P (xjphone j ; ti) . <p> With the exception of this final input feature, this net was the same as the hybrid HMM/MLP system as described in <ref> [5] </ref>. For the preliminary tests, we assumed knowledge of the boundaries between the phones as produced by an automatic alignment (Viterbi) procedure on the known word string [8].
