Abstract: A multi-level hierarchical control system has been designed and is being applied to chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process control. The current implementation of the control system incorporates closed-loop run-to-run (R2R) control and open-loop real-time monitoring and can accommodate inter-cell control. The R2R control element is enabled via a Generic Cell Controller (GCC) implementation that provides exible automated control of the process and equipment, multiple control algorithm branches and fuzzy logic decision capability among the branches, simulation capabilities, hardware and software independence, and extensive GUI support for control and data analysis. The R2R element utilizes a linear approximation multivariate control algorithm (branch) that supports individual exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) modeling of ad-vices (outputs), weighting of inputs, input granularity, and input bounding. The real-time element of the control system utilizes a partial least squares (PLS) algorithm to identify real-time equipment input trace patterns and relate these patterns to alarming conditions. The entire control system is designed to provide multivariate control of CMP process removal rate and uniformity. As a result of extensive design of experiments and testing, the R2R control level has been demonstrated to achieve good control of removal rate and fair control of uniformity. The addition of the real-time element is expected to improve process control and reduce R2R process noise, thus leading to a more effective R2R control element.

Reference-contexts: Related results associated with the development and deployment of the GCC implementation described in this paper have also been documented in literature. Specifically, practical issues associated with the utilization of a R2R control algorithm are discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>. Issues of R2R control that relate specifically to CMP are discussed in [1]. <p> On the other hand, larger weights will also cause the controller to react more aggressively to noise in the outputs, which can increase the overall noise through the system. Methods for optimal selection of weight coefficients are discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>. Current research is investigating methods for dynamic selection of the weight based on observation of the system itself (e.g., to decrease the weight if one observes that the noise in the system increases over time). <p> Once the model has been updated, the model is inverted to solve for the plant controls that best achieve the desired targets for the output parameters of interest.

Reference-contexts: The ASM utilizes a fuzzy rule-based decision-making process to select from multiple algorithms. The fuzzy rules express knowledge about the suitability of the different control algorithms based on the process conditions. For a detailed description of the Algorithm Selection Module and its integration with the GCC, see <ref> [16, 4] </ref>. The basic functionality of the ASM is depicted in Figure 5. 3.2 The MIT Run-by-Run Controller The MIT Run-by-Run (MIT RbR) controller is the main control algorithm that is in use in the current GCC implementation. It provides sequential control advices through a multivariate adaptive model-based approach.
