Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Opal is a system for computing Grobner bases of ideals in noncommutative polynomial rings defined as path algebras. This document is a user reference for the system. A familiarity with the basic concepts of Grobner bases and path algebras is assumed (references for these subjects include <ref> [1] </ref> and [2]). The Opal system is currently able to do the following operations: 1. Generate full Grobner bases for problem instances with finite Grobner bases. 2. Generate partial Grobner bases for problem instances consisting of homogeneous generators with infinite Grobner bases. 3.
