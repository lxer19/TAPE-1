Abstract: Spin is software package for verification of concurrent systems. The formal models of the systems that are verified, are built in Promela Spin's input language. We present an extension of Promela and Spin with discrete time that provides an opportunity to model systems which correct functioning crucially depends on timing parameters. The new version of the tool is completely compatible with all the features the standard package, including partial order reduction. We have tested the prototype tool on several applications known in the verification literature and the first results are very promising. The Spin Model Checker. Originally, Promela and Spin have been developed for analysis and validation of communication protocols [10]. The language syntax is derived form C, but also uses the denotations for communications from Hoare's CSP and control flow statements based on Dijkstra's guarded commands. The full presentation of Promela and Spin is beyond the scope of this paper and we suggest [10] as a reference to the interested reader. Following [11] we only give a short overview of the language and validation tools. In Promela, the system components are modeled as processes that can communicate via channels either by buffered message exchanges or rendez-vous operations, and also trough shared memory represented as global variables. The execution of actions is considered asynchronous and interleaved, which means that in every step only one enabled action is performed and without any additional assumptions of the relative speed of the process execution. Given as an input a Promela model Spin can do random or interactive simulations or to generate a C program that performs a validation of the system by scanning the state space. The validation with the compiled C program is done in separate phases. The one phase is validation of the safety properties (absence of deadlock, unspecified message receptions, invalid end states and assertions) trough a search of the state space. Verification of most of the liveness properties can be handled by detection of progress and acceptance cycles. The never-claims constructs are the most general way to verify the system by providing the possibility to express properties as linear-time temporal logic (LTL) formulae. All kinds of errors are reported by saving the trace of the actions leading to an invalid state or cycle. The erroneous sequence can be repeated as a guided simulation. The simplest way to do scanning of the state space is trough an exhaustive search.
