Abstract: Figure 2. Combined ROSAT and ASCA spectrum of the Vela jet head and the surrounding SNR in units of counts s 1 keV 1 per unit CCD area of 11 fi 11 arcmin 2 . ROSAT bins are in the range 0.1-2.4 keV and are wide, while ASCA bins are narrow and in the range 0.7-7.0 keV. The Head+SNR spectrum (dark points) is about twice as intense as the SNR alone (light points) but has almost the same shape above 0.7 keV. Below 0.7 keV the emission from the SNR dominates and the two spectra are nearly indistinguishable. The primary surprises from the new ASCA results are that the jet and SNR spectra are very similar (differing only in intensity above 0.7 keV) and that both the jet and SNR spectrum are lacking emission line features, unless the lines are so severely blended that they form a continuum. The shocks must be weak at the head of the jet since there is no significant temperature difference between the cocoon and the SNR. Still, the energy flow in the jet remains comparable to the spindown luminosity of the pulsar, and indicates that it is connected to an outflow along the rotation axis of the pulsar. With the observation of jet-like signatures associated with this and other pulsars, we suggest that jets may be more ubiquitous than previously imagined and that a search for jets around other pulsars may prove fruitful.
