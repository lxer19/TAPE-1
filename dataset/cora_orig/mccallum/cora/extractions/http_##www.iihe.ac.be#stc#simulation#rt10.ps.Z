Reference-contexts: Introduction of the intermediate layer ADL <ref> [10] </ref> : the main purpose of this feature is to define a clear border between the editing phase and the simulation phase. The advantage of doing this, is to be independent of a specific graphical interface and to be able to run our models on different target machines.

Usage of MODLINE <ref> [11] </ref> : the objective is to reuse an existing software dedicated to the management of scenarios, visualization of the simulations results and the production of reports.
