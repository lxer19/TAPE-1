Abstract: We explore how lattice rules can reduce the variance of the estimators for simulation problems, in comparison with the Monte Carlo method. To do this, we compare these two methods on option valuation problems in finance, along with two types of (t; s)-sequences. We also look at the effect of combining variance reduction techniques with the preceding approaches. Our numerical results seem to indicate that lattice rules are less affected by the "curse of dimensionality" than the other types of quasi-Monte Carlo methods and provide more precise estimators than Monte Carlo does.

Reference-contexts: We give in Sect. 3 three examples of selection criteria to choose lattice rules. Section 4 discusses some general concepts about improving the efficiency of the estimators in a quasi-random context and the following section explains the finance problem (the same as in <ref> [1] </ref>) used for the numerical illustrations of Sect. 6. A conclusion is made in the last section. 2. Lattice Rules We first recall some standard definitions that can be found in [14,28]. <p> For (t; m; s)-nets, these two alternative methods have the additional advantage of putting more importance on the first variables, which is good because (t; m; s)-nets are usually better equidistributed in the first dimensions. See <ref> [1] </ref> for more on this idea. 5. A Finance Problem Finance gives rise to several interesting problems involving the computation of multidimensional integrals. An example is the pricing of contingent claims, which are assets whose price depends on the value of other assets, called underlying assets. <p> As the numerical results in [21] show, this control variable brings a dramatic variance reduction. Antithetic variates may also be used in order to give a small additional reduction of the variance. 6. Numerical Experiments Following what has been done in <ref> [1] </ref>, we first want to compare the standard method with the two methods mentioned above (Brownian bridge (BB) and principal components (PC)) to reduce the effective dimension. What is new here is that we use these in combination with lattice rules, and not only MC and (t; m; s)-nets. <p> It is often recommended (as a heuristic) to skip a certain number of points at the beginning of a (t; s)-sequence [13,4]. We skipped the first N points for Sobol and the first 200000 points for GFaure (as in <ref> [1] </ref>). Instead of randomizing the low-discrepancy point sets to estimate the integration error and compare the different sets on that basis, here we use the same procedure as in [1]: we take a function f for which If can be computed exactly, calculate the error of our estimate Qf , and <p> We skipped the first N points for Sobol and the first 200000 points for GFaure (as in <ref> [1] </ref>). Instead of randomizing the low-discrepancy point sets to estimate the integration error and compare the different sets on that basis, here we use the same procedure as in [1]: we take a function f for which If can be computed exactly, calculate the error of our estimate Qf , and repeat this a few times with i.i.d. instances of the problem, which are obtained by generating randomly some of the parameters describing the function. <p> Then, the measure of performance of a method is taken as the root mean square (RMS) relative error obtained that way. The function we use corresponds to the price of an asian option on the geometric average. Its parameters K, r and oe are chosen randomly as in <ref> [1] </ref> and we take 250 i.i.d. instances with T 1 = 0, T = 1 year and S (0) = 100.

Reference-contexts: To model the evolution of the underlying asset, we use the model of Black and Scholes <ref> [3] </ref>, which says that dS (t) = S (t)dt + oeS (t)dB (t) ; where is the mean return parameter of the asset, oe is its volatility parameter and B () is a standard Brownian motion. <p> N = 4096 and s = 90.

Reference-contexts: Then, use the estimator ~ X LR = i=1 Using results on the stratification method <ref> [7] </ref>, one can show that Var ( ~ X LR ) Var (X MC ). Of course, the computation cost required by this modified method is higher than if we use the same shift for all points, but it has the same asymptotic order than for the MC method. 4.

Reference-contexts: For QMC methods, the usual way of achieving this is to randomize the point set P so that its regularity properties are preserved. One approach is the Cranley-Patterson randomization technique <ref> [8] </ref>, originally proposed for lattice rules. The idea of this method is to generate m i.i.d. vectors 1 ; : : : ; m , randomly and uniformly over [0; 1) s , and use them to randomly shift the point set P , modulo 1.

Reference-contexts: For this reason, searches based on ae rarely extend to dimensions greater than 8 or 10. If we use the euclidean norm khk e = i P s j 1=2 instead of the product norm k k in the definition of ae (as suggested in <ref> [9] </ref>), we get d 1 h2L ? nf0g where d s corresponds to the distance between the farthest family of hyper-planes that cover L, and is the quantity measured by the spectral test, a figure of merit commonly used for LCGs ([18,19,16]). See [9] for the connections be- tween ae and <p> the definition of ae (as suggested in <ref> [9] </ref>), we get d 1 h2L ? nf0g where d s corresponds to the distance between the farthest family of hyper-planes that cover L, and is the quantity measured by the spectral test, a figure of merit commonly used for LCGs ([18,19,16]).

Reference-contexts: Also, the three criteria presented here are just a few examples among many others available, for general point sets P . See <ref> [14] </ref> for more on this. 4. Probabilistic Efficiency Improvement Viewpoint In the preceding section, we have explained how the deterministic upper bound (3) can be used to derive criteria for choosing P . <p> So, reducing the effective dimension also helps lattice rules. Though the usual way of explaining this kind of response is via ANOVA decompositions <ref> [14] </ref>, looking at (5) helps to see what goes on here. BB and PC change f to a function g such that j^g (h)j 6= 0 only for h with few nonzero coordinates.

Reference-contexts: To reduce the variance of the estimator of C A (0), C G (0) can be used as a control variable, as explained in <ref> [15] </ref>. The geometric average is always smaller than the arithmetic average, but these two quantities are highly correlated and so are the corresponding option prices. As the numerical results in [21] show, this control variable brings a dramatic variance reduction.

Reference-contexts: P is called a low-discrepancy point set if D (P ) is small. One way to make this statement more precise is to use a particular definition of D (P ), for example the star-discrepancy D fl (P ) <ref> [23] </ref>, and ask for D fl (P ) to be in O (N 1 (log N ) s ).

Reference-contexts: Though other methods specially designed for (t; m; s)-nets have been proposed (the scrambled (t,m,s)-nets in <ref> [24] </ref>), one can use the Cranley-Patterson technique for them as well. 3.

Reference-contexts: In the case where P is derived from a lattice (P = L " [0; 1) s ), a straightforward way to be brought in this setting is to use the fact that if f has an absolutely convergent Fourier series representation, then one has <ref> [28] </ref>: Qf If = h2L ? nf0g where ^ f (h) is the Fourier coefficient of f evaluated at h 2 ZZ s . <p> Another possibility stemming from equation (6) is to find lattice rules minimizing the dominant quantity in this expression or, equivalently, that maximize ae = min khk ; (7) the so-called Zaremba index <ref> [28] </ref>. This quantity has also been used as a cri terion to select lattice rules, but seems harder to compute than P ff . For this reason, searches based on ae rarely extend to dimensions greater than 8 or 10.

We use Sobol <ref> [30] </ref> and generalized Faure (GFaure) [10,32] sequences to construct the (t; m; s)-nets, as provided by the software package FINDER [26,27]. Since Sobol sequences are developed in base 2, we took care of using N equal to a power of 2 for them, so that the equidistribution property holds.
