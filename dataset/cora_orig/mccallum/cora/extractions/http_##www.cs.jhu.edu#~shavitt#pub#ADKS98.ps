Abstract: The future global teranode networks will consist of many subnetworks called domains. For reasons of both scalability and security, domains will not release details of their internal structure to nodes outside of the domain . Rather, they will release a summary, or aggregation, of the internal structure, e.g., as required by the ATM PNNI standard. This work compares by simulation the effect of different aggregation schemes on the network throughput, and on the network control measured in the number of crank-backs per realized connection. It shows, that using stars for aggregation results in bad performance when compared with other simply methods. keyword: PNNI, topology aggregation, routing, teranode networks, hierarchical network structure

Reference-contexts: Interestingly, the effect of topology aggregation on the performance of networks was rarely studied in the past. There is a large body of theoretical research that studies compact graph representation <ref> [Bar96, PU88, PS89, ADD + 93] </ref> but the emphasis in the theoretical research is on the maximum cost distortion between any pair of nodes in the aggregated graph. <p> In this work, we simulate several aggregation schemes and compare their performance. We concentrated on stars, spanning trees, and spanners <ref> [PU88, PS89, ADD + 93] </ref>, and compare their performance to the case where no aggregation is performed. We show that the differences in the throughput and, to a larger extent, in the network control overhead can be hundreds of percents. <p> Minimum spanning tree and 2-spanner perform closely to the optimum, i.e., when full information is available. It is interesting to examine the performance implication on t-spanners when the allowed stretch factor is increased. This is also important since the bound <ref> [ADD + 93] </ref> on the size of a 2-spanner is n n, where n is the number of border nodes, which is too costly. The performance of random spanning tree aggregation is found to be very sensitive to network topology.

Reference-contexts: An algorithm for a tree-based construction within the PNNI aggregation framework (using bypass exception) is described and analyzed by Awerbuch and Shavitt <ref> [AS97] </ref>. We intend to simulate it in our future work. This paper shows that performing re-aggregation using our logarithmic update policy reduces the number of aggregations drastically, yet the performance is not compromised. We also show that exponential cost metric results in better performance than min-hop as theory suggests.

Reference-contexts: It can be explained by the fact that the first stage of rings is where the majority of requests fail to pass, and for the rest of the ring stages the flow of requests does not increase with the load. This phenomenon was observed by Cidon et al. <ref> [CRS96] </ref> for one-way reservation schemes. We turn to investigate random topologies. We generate random two level networks depicted at figures 8 and 9. At each level the nodes were given random locations on a grid, with 7 (or 8) in the high level and 20 in the low level.

Reference-contexts: Typically these domains will correspond to portions of the network that reside in a particular geographical region or that belong to a particular organization. For reasons of both scalability and security, domains will not release details of their internal structure to nodes outside of the domain <ref> [tc96, CCS96] </ref>. Rather, they will release a summary, or aggregation, of the internal structure. <p> The most promising approach is to find a new aggregate topology which is simpler than the real topology, yet still captures its structure. This is the approach taken by the Private Network-to-Network Interface (PNNI) group of the ATM Forum. The PNNI standard <ref> [tc96] </ref> suggests to replace internal network structure by a star with a virtual center and spokes to the border nodes. Other, simple aggregation schemes are to use minimum (or random) spanning trees. <p> The good performance of MST aggregation makes a strong case for deploying a tree-based en hancements for the PNNI star aggregation. Such enhancements can be facilitated by using the 18 are used and when full update is used for the topology of figure 16. 19 exceptions allowed by PNNI <ref> [tc96, section 3.3.8] </ref>. An algorithm for a tree-based construction within the PNNI aggregation framework (using bypass exception) is described and analyzed by Awerbuch and Shavitt [AS97]. We intend to simulate it in our future work.

Reference-contexts: We also report results for randomly generated topologies that are commonly used in simulation studies <ref> [Wax88] </ref>. Finally, we test the influence of the aggregation policy, i.e., when we should report about changes and re-advertise. 2.1 Aggregation methods The following aggregation were simulated: Complete | No aggregation is done. The full cost matrix between the border nodes is broadcasted. <p> Links are added by a random process that generates a random node-pair and adds a link between them with probability that decreases exponentially with the distance between the two nodes <ref> [Wax88] </ref>. Links that increase the node degree (external links are not counted) above four are rejected. The process terminates when all nodes degree is at least two. High level links are assigned arbitrary border nodes in the corresponding sub-networks.
