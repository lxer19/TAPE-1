Title: Two Complementary Course Sequences on the Design and Implementation of Software Products  
Author: JAMES E. BURNS and EDWARD L. ROBERTSON

Abstract: For many students, the first chance to produce software as part of a team comes with the first work experience outside a university. The difficulties of working with others are compounded by the problems of working in a new environment and for a client with ambiguous and changing goals. Although it is difficult to approximate the "real-world" accurately in an academic course, we have implemented two full-year course sequences which apparently give our students some insight into the problems they will face when they leave the university. One course requires the development and implementation of a software product by a team of undergraduates and the other requires experienced graduate students to act as supervisors for the undergraduate projects. We describe the content and structure of these two sequences, emphasizing how they support and enhance each other. We believe other curricula would benefit from similar courses.

Reference-contexts: III. The Project Course Sequence 7 The Information Systems course sequence has two major components, one based on traditional class work (lectures, exams, homework, etc.) and the other on a major team project. The lecture component covers file media (corresponding to CS 5 of Curriculum 78 <ref> [2] </ref>) during the first semester and database systems (corresponding to CS 11) during the second. The team project component, which is the focus of this paper, serves the goals of CS 14 of Curriculum 78, although it is not taught as a separate course.
