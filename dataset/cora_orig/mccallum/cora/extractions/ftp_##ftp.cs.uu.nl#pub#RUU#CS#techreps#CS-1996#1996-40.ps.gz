Abstract: A constrained variational surface is a surface that minimizes some energy functional under certain interpolation constraints. Modeling surfaces using constrained variational principles is attractive, because the designer is not bothered with the precise representation of the surface (e.g. control points). Until now, the modeling of variational surfaces is mainly done by specifying a number of constraints. If such a surface of least energy is deformed locally (e.g. by moving its control points) the concept of energy minimization is lost. In this paper we introduce deform operators with built-in energy terms. Their effect is to move groups of control points to modify the shape of the surface, while the surface is still computed by minimizing a certain energy functional. We have tested our ideas in a prototype system for modeling surfaces of triangular Bezier patches. Experiments show that these operators offer an effective way of modeling.

Reference-contexts: Through the choice of an internal energy the designer has a certain kind of global control over the shape of the surface. Another basic way of modeling the shape of a variational surface is by means of specifying constraints (see e.g. <ref> [Celniker and Gossard, 91] </ref>, [Kallay, 93], [Moreton and Sequin, 92], and [Welch and Witkin, 92]). The most common constraints are point and normal interpolation. Sometimes also curve interpolation constraints are used (see e.g. [Kallay, 93]). The interpolation constraints can be used to sketch a rough outline of a surface. <p> Our external energy operators are more general for design than only spring forces (see e.g. [Terzopoulos and Qin, 94]). Other surface representations used are tensor product surfaces, e.g. [Kallay, 93], [Moreton and Sequin, 92], [Welch and Witkin, 92], [Terzopoulos and Qin, 94], or triangular patches with rational weighting functions <ref> [Celniker and Gossard, 91] </ref>. A drawback of tensor product surfaces is that they cannot be subdivided locally. <p> In <ref> [Celniker and Gossard, 91] </ref>, [Kallay, 93] and [Welch and Witkin, 92] the following approximations are given to the stretch energy (4) and the bend energy (5), sometimes with some additional parameters: E stretch (S) = Z @u + @S 2 dudv; (6) E bend (S) = Z @u 2 + 2

Reference-contexts: Firstly, since they must be linear in the control points they are more restrictive than the general tangent plane continuity constraints we actually want, which costs many degrees of freedom. Secondly they generate many constraint equations that must be eliminated. Triangular simplex splines, for example DMS-splines <ref> [Dahmen et al., 92] </ref>, are inherently smooth, which eliminates the need for continuity constraints. We have also implemented the external operators for DMS-splines, but the energy terms are hard to evaluate exactly, and the integrands may differ from patch to patch [Wesselink, 96].

Reference-contexts: This results in a quadratic minimization problem with linear constraints, that is solved using a standard method. 2. Surface representation We have used triangular Bezier patches. Spline surfaces composed of triangular patches have some advantages over rectangular patches (see <ref> [Farin, 93] </ref>). For instance, triangular patches are better suited to describe complex geometries, and they can be subdivided locally. A triangular Bezier patch T is defined by Eq. (2) as the weighted sum of a number of control points P i;j;k .

Reference-contexts: General patch subdivision splits a patch into several patches that together have the same shape as the original one. Subdivision algorithms for Bezier triangles are given by <ref> [Goldman, 83] </ref>. In this paper we will use two ways of subdivision, into two, and into three triangles. 3. Internal energy The internal energy of a surface S is the part of the total energy (1) that depends only on properties of the surface itself.

Reference-contexts: A drawback of the approximations is that they are parameterization dependent. It is only a good approximation if the Jacobian determinant fi @u fi @S fi fi does not differ too much from one. A compromise between those two is the data dependent approximations described in <ref> [Greiner et al., 96] </ref>, which is computationally more expensive than the approximations above, but is in general a better approximation. The internal energy E int we use is a linear combination of E stretch and E bend . 4.

Reference-contexts: First the constraint equations (33) are used to eliminate some variables from the minimization problem (32). This results in an unconstrained minimization problem with an object function of the same form as (30). This unconstrained minimization problem is simply solved using the standard conjugate gradient method (see e.g. <ref> [Luenberger, 89] </ref>). 14 7. Conclusions We have introduced a way to interactively model variational surfaces, by means of operators that affect the total energy of the surface. These operators effectively control groups of control points.

Reference-contexts: This paper introduces some design operators that do not suffer from this problem. The effect of such an operator is defined by an energy functional. Since this functional depends on properties from outside the surface, it is called external. This has been proved to be successful for 3D curves <ref> [Veltkamp and Wesselink, 95] </ref>, and is extended to surfaces in this paper.
