Title: Fair End-to-End Window-based Congestion Control

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of fair end-to-end window-based congestion control protocols for packet-switched networks with FCFS routers. Our definition of fairness generalizes proportional fairness and includes arbitrarily close approximations of max-min fairness. The protocols use only information that is available to end hosts and are designed to converge reasonably fast. Our study is based on a multiclass fluid model of the network. The convergence of the protocols is proved using a Lyapunov function. The technical challenge is in the construction of the protocols.

Reference-contexts: Roughly, a fair scheme is one that does not penalize some users arbitrarily. Accordingly, the question that arises naturally is the existence of fair end-to-end congestion protocols. In an early paper, Jaffe [17] shows that power cannot be optimized in a distributed manner.

Reference-contexts: Accordingly, the window size of a connection with a short propagation delay increases faster than that of a connection with a longer propagation delay. Consequently, a long-delay connection looses out when competing with a short-delay connection.

They report that if the rate of increase of the window size is not excessive, then this scheme is not harmful to the other connections that use the original TCP scheme.
