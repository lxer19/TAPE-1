Title: Mental Models: A Survey  
Author: Karl B. Schwamb

Abstract: This paper reviews a class of cognitive representations collectively known as mental models. These representations purport to integrate certain aspects of propositional and imagistic theories of knowledge representation while enabling more detailed theories of human cognitive behavior. This paper explores the nature of mental models by considering basic philosophical issues including ontology and semantics. Psychological evidence supporting the existence and identifying characteristics of these models are reviewed in the areas of comprehension, problem solving, and learning. Where available, computational implementations of mental model theories are discussed. After a comparison of mental models with more conventional knowledge representations, a brief discussion and directions for future research are given.

Reference-contexts: Mental models are composed of a finite set of elements, each of which denotes some object, along with operations on those elements for construction, revision, and evaluation. The structure is derived 3 This latter point is persuasively argued in <ref> (Anderson, 1987) </ref>. 4 See (Wenger, 1987) for an overview of intelligent tutoring systems. 4 from ontological constraints, relations in the perceived or conceived world, and the need to avoid contradictions (Johnson-Laird, 1983).

Reference-contexts: The use of assumptions forces envisionment to construct a set of plausible models so external evidence must be used to select one as "the" causal model. The primary motivation for developing the circuit model was to investigate its applicability to instruction in device troubleshooting <ref> (Brown, Burton, & de Kleer, 1982) </ref>. de Kleer and Brown view the diagnosis process as a form of abduction, attempting to determine the (change in) structure from the (mis)functioning device. Davis (1984) concurs with this view.

Reference-contexts: More will certainly be forthcoming. 3 Definitions There have been many definitions of the term mental model offered in the literature. The philosopher Craik viewed all mental representation as mimicing the physical world. He conjectured that people operate on mental representations to simulate real-world behavior and produce predictions <ref> (Craik, 1943) </ref>. Johnson-Laird, one of the most influential psychologists in the area, describes a mental model as a cognitive representation which represents a "state of affairs" in part by having a similar "relation structure".

Reference-contexts: Also, his theory was developed analytically, not by observing human behavior, so its psychological validity is questionable. DiSessa had similar objectives in suggesting "phenomenological primitives" (p-prims for short) underlying our understanding of the physical world <ref> (DiSessa, 1983) </ref>. 10 He defines 9 The notion of ontology deals with more issues as well, including fundamental properties of media in which objects are embedded.

Reference-contexts: Johnson-Laird (1981) also discusses the modelling of spatial placement. He presents 23 Indeed, the use of the term "retina" is unfortunate. Researchers in mental imagery have concluded that imagery processing does not extend down to the level of the retina <ref> (see Finke, 1989) </ref>. Certain properties of the retina (e.g., afterimages) do not appear to be producible in mental imagery experiments. 24 a persuasive argument for its use in comprehension by considering the number of place-ment models that can be generated from linguistic descriptions. <p> Hence, this view might be seen as building on Paivio's (1986) dual coding approach. On the other hand, several results from imagery research seem to indicate that current thought on the nature of mental imagery may be more like those associated with mental models then a static pictorial view <ref> (Finke, 1989) </ref>. Propositions can handle indeterminate relations easily while mental models are better with determinate ones. Johnson-Laird (1983) conjectures that people form a mental model of determinate descriptions. Experimental evidence appears to supports this belief (Bransford & McCarrell, 1974; Bransford & Johnson, 1972; Garnham, 1987).

Reference-contexts: Finke's (1989) account of mental imagery seems to lend support for such a notion. Garnham (1987) finds both mental models and schemata to be terms that characterize frameworks instead of specific representations and the diversity of research mentioned above seems to support that claim. In <ref> (Funt, 1980) </ref> Kosslyn is cited as stating that our internal representation of images is analogous to way images are stored in computer graphics. That is, we store enough detailed information to be able to reconstruct images rather than storing the images themselves.

Reference-contexts: By representing the world in a more direct fashion than most other representations, mental models serve to both represent actual situations and interpret linguistic expressions <ref> (Garnham, 1987) </ref>. The use of similar structure gives mental models a "transparent" semantics through referential means. Experiments by Johnson-Laird (1983), Garnham (1987), Bransford and McCarrell (1974), and others have shown the importance of reference in comprehension. This enables the inference of spatial relations, instruments, and consequences of situations.

Rips (1986) notes a distinction between literal mental models (e.g., those posited by Johnson-Laird, 1983) and figurative ones <ref> (such as those discussed in Gentner & Stevens, 1983) </ref>. A literal modeler would propose that we consider elements in our minds that represent objects in the world and that when we reason, we manipulate this model.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the literature has little to say on this issue. By an ontology, we refer to the components which make up a mental model and the collection of properties we use to describe these objects. 9 Greeno has discussed several ways in which an ontology is important to modeling <ref> (Greeno, 1983) </ref>. The selection of conceptual entities determines what procedures may be applied to them. Poor selections may lead to either problem-solving impasses or inefficiencies.

Reference-contexts: While analogical reasoning also considers similar relation structures, that field focusses on potential mappings between systems. Restricted by a semantics of reference, mental models make the modest presumption of a lawful relation between the structure of a mental model and the represented situation. See <ref> (Hall, 1989b) </ref> for an overview of analogical reasoning. 7 Hayes (1974) argues that the properties are preserved via homomorphism rather than denotation. But Garnham (1987) observes that this denotation through structural similarity produces a transparent semantics.

Reference-contexts: This latter point is also stressed by Kahneman and Tversky who considered whether people occasionally utilize a simulation heuristic to make judgements. They found the heuristic to be of fairly limited power <ref> (Kahneman & Tversky, 1982) </ref>. On a positive note, Norman finds that mental models are somewhat parsimonious because people prefer to use extra physical operations in problem solving rather than complicate their model of a device.

Reference-contexts: This notion is closely related to the notion of implicit relations typically found in mental models. Both describe phenomena in a structural manner to avoid unnecessarily committing to a particular interpretation. While the principle has been criticized for being unachievable <ref> (Keuneke & Allemang, 1989) </ref>, it has been a useful guide in developing robust models. de Kleer and Brown (1983) characterize their approach to mental models of devices as involving four aspects: a specification of device topology (implicitly including device descriptions); envisioning, which determines function using the structure of the device; causal

Reference-contexts: Notions of truth are discussed also since mental models, unlike most other theories of knowledge representation, relate meaning closely to truth conditions. To limit the discussion, we consider only linguistic communication. 13 Also excluded are peripheral aspects of meaning, including the connotative, stylistic, affective, and thematic <ref> (see Leech, 1974) </ref>. Frege identified two main aspects of conceptual semantics: sense and reference. These correspond closely to the more contemporary terms "intension" and "extension". These aspects of meaning are motivated by two philosophical theories of truth: coherence and correspondence, respectively.

Reference-contexts: notes that since science is inherently a modeling enterprise, researchers must be careful to distinguish the following four viewpoints of an phenomenon: the phenomenon itself, subjects' mental model of the phenomenon, the cognitive scientists' model of the subject's model, and (if the phenomenon is an artifact) the artifact designers' model <ref> (Norman, 1983) </ref>. It is also judicious to point out that not all cognitive scientists are agreeable to the aforementioned defining characteristics of mental models. Guided by his observations of people interacting with artifacts, Norman concludes that mental models are inherently difficult to define (Norman, 1983). <p> is an artifact) the artifact designers' model <ref> (Norman, 1983) </ref>. It is also judicious to point out that not all cognitive scientists are agreeable to the aforementioned defining characteristics of mental models. Guided by his observations of people interacting with artifacts, Norman concludes that mental models are inherently difficult to define (Norman, 1983). He finds that people's mental models of artifacts are: unstable because details are not always remembered; not clearly bounded because similar devices and operations are confused with each other; "unscientific" because occasionally actions appear to be based on superstition; and not easily simulated due to model complexity. <p> Guided by their certainties, people develop behavior patterns that make them more secure in their actions <ref> (Norman, 1983) </ref>. 4 Implicit Relations The implicit relation property of mental models mentioned above is derived primarily from observations made in the mental imagery literature. 6 Palmer (1978) holds that this property is derived from an analogue representation of knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Rouse and Morris, in a survey primarily directed at the "manual control" field, view mental models as mechanisms whereby humans generate descriptions of system purpose and form, explanations of system functioning and observable system states, and predictions of future system states <ref> (Rouse & Morris, 1986) </ref>. This is an admitted intersection of the usages given in the manual control literature which presents even vaguer descriptions. <p> For similar reasons, Young (1983) and Rouse and Morris (1986) disagree with formulations based solely on device models since the most appropriate conceptualizations for problem solvers may depend on the task and a system-oriented version of mental model would be incomplete <ref> (Rouse & Morris, 1986) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: They claim that situation models integrate episodic information with general information from semantic memory. It is unclear whether situation models are unique (and updated upon recall) or used to collect similar situations as in MOPS theory <ref> (Schank, 1982) </ref>. van Dijk and Kintsch believe the latter is more likely although those sympathetic to mental models would proabably prefer the former. Garnham (1987) presents further evidence on the nature of reference adding support to the idea of using a mental model in comprehension.

Reference-contexts: In a more abstract form, a device model is a more compact representation than a set of propositions or rules for modeling the real world. This is particularly evident when considering device fault diagnosis. Using so-called "mal-rules" requires designers to enumerate all possible faults <ref> (Sleeman, 1982) </ref>. In a device model, faults are modeled by changes to component objects or their topology.

Reference-contexts: In addressing that issue, investigators will need to consider several key questions aimed at separating out the contribution of mental models from other representation schemes. First, if models possess implicit relations, do they differ from earlier proposals for analogue representations <ref> (Sloman, 1971) </ref>? These were criticized heavily by Hayes (1974) and others who claimed that nothing could be gained that was not already available from propositional representations. In fact, Forbus (1984) gives an implementation of qualitative process theory as logical axioms. Such arguments retarded work in this area for years.

Reference-contexts: This latter point is also stressed by Kahneman and Tversky who considered whether people occasionally utilize a simulation heuristic to make judgements. They found the heuristic to be of fairly limited power <ref> (Kahneman & Tversky, 1982) </ref>. On a positive note, Norman finds that mental models are somewhat parsimonious because people prefer to use extra physical operations in problem solving rather than complicate their model of a device.

Reference-contexts: Mental models are composed of a finite set of elements, each of which denotes some object, along with operations on those elements for construction, revision, and evaluation. The structure is derived 3 This latter point is persuasively argued in (Anderson, 1987). 4 See <ref> (Wenger, 1987) </ref> for an overview of intelligent tutoring systems. 4 from ontological constraints, relations in the perceived or conceived world, and the need to avoid contradictions (Johnson-Laird, 1983).

Reference-contexts: Like de Kleer and Brown, researchers Williams, Hollan, and Stevens view mental models as composed of autonomous objects with an associated topology, "runnable" by means of local qualitative inference, as well as being decomposable <ref> (Williams, Hollan, & Stevens, 1983) </ref> Each object has an explicit representation of state, its connection to other objects, and a set of internal parameters. Each object has a set of rules which modify its parameters thereby defining its behavior. "Running" is equivalent to propagating information through 5 the device topology.

Reference-contexts: Gar-nham cites Winograd's SHRDLU program as exemplifying such model-based reasoning since its limited natural language understanding was performed with the aid of a small closed world of objects in a particular setting <ref> (Winograd, 1972) </ref>. He also maintains that people use a demand-driven procedure to fill in missing information from texts. Using a special self-paced reading technique, his experiments seem to indicate that people don't fill in missing agents and instruments upon encoding.
