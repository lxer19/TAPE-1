Title: A Dynamic Management Scheme for Real-Time Connections  
Author: Colin Parris, Hui Zhang and Domenico Ferrari 
Affiliation: The Tenet Group Computer Science Division, University of California, Berkeley and International Computer Science Institute  
Abstract: Most of the solutions proposed to support real-time (i.e. guaranteed performance) communication services in packet-switching networks adopt a connection-oriented and reservation-oriented approach. In such an approach, resource allocation and route selection decisions are made before the start of the communication on the basis of resource availability and real-time network load at that time, and are usually kept for the duration of the communication. This rather static resource management approach has certain limitations: it does not take into account (a) the dy-namicity of the communicating clients; (b) the dynamicity of the network state; and (c) the tradeoff between quality of service and network availability, thus affecting the availability and flexibility of the real-time network services. Availability is the ability of the network to accommodate as many real-time clients as possible, while flexibility is the ability to adapt the real-time services to changing network state and client demands. In this paper, we present the Dynamic Connection Management (DCM) scheme, which addresses these issues by providing the network with the capability to dynamically modify the performance parameters and the routes of any existing real-time connection. With these capabilities, DCM can be used to increase the availability and flexibility of the guaranteed performance service offered to the clients.

A real-time channel is a network connection associated with traffic and performance parameters. The parameters are provided by the clients to specify their traffic characteristics and performance requirements.

Reference-contexts: This interface is usually of the form of a unique identifier at the source and destination host and is preserved by appropriately modifying entries in the virtual circuit routing tables during connection establishment and modification. The manner in which this is accomplished is described in detail in <ref> [8] </ref>. 4.2.2 The DCM Transition Algorithm The DCM transition algorithm ensures that the transition from the primary to the alternate channel does not violate the DCM modification contract.

Reference-contexts: It is desirable to adapt the quality of service offered to the clients based on the load of the network. Of course, in order to stay within the framework of guaranteed performance communication, the adaptation should be graceful (i.e., to be done with the consent of the clients) <ref> [9] </ref>. In this paper, we present the Dynamic Connection Management (DCM) scheme, which permits the modification of the traffic and performance parameters, and of the route of a connection during the lifetime of that connection.

Reference-contexts: This queueing delay is calculated by using the admissions tests provided in Section 3.2 and Section 4.2.1 to determine the minimum queueing delay that this link can offer a connection with these traffic characteristics. The details of the routing algorithm can be found in <ref> [10] </ref>. The administrative constraints (e.g. resource sharing) are achieved by modifying the weights associated with the edges (i.e. links) of the graph before applying the algorithm. With an administrative parameter value of 0 and 1, no adjustment is made to the edges of the graphs.
