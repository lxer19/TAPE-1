Abstract: Two-level domain decomposition methods are developed for a simple nonconforming approximation of second order elliptic problems. A bound is established for the condition number of these iterative methods, that grows only logarithmically with the number of degrees of freedom in each subregion. This bound holds for two and three dimensions and is independent of jumps in the value of the coefficients and number of subregions. We introduce face coarse spaces, and isomorphisms to map between conforming and nonconforming spaces. 1. Introduction. The purpose of this paper is to develop domain decomposition methods for second order elliptic partial differential equations approximated by

Reference-contexts: We also note that this bound is independent of the variations of the coefficients across the subregion interfaces. Our motivation for considering the P 1 -nonconforming space comes from the equivalence established by Arnold and Brezzi <ref> [1] </ref> between nonconforming methods and Raviart-Thomas mixed methods. The latter methods are useful in applications for which an accurate approximation to the flux variable of the elliptic problem is required and the solution (of the elliptic problem) is not sufficiently smooth; see Sarkis [26].

Interpolation operator. In this section, we introduce an interpolation operator for P 1 -nonconforming spaces and establish that it is stable. <p> Here we show that any convex combination of the fi (x), for fi 1=2, leads to stability. We remark that we can even define a Neumann-Neumann coarse space for fi = 1 by considering the limit of fi ! 1; see Dryja, Sarkis, and Widlund <ref> [13] </ref>. We point out that the choice fi = 1=2 can be viewed as a L 2 -average, while fi = 1 is an average in the L 1 sense. The coarse spaces of the previous section are face based.

To prove Lemma 8 for a general u H 2 ~ V H ( i ), we use the same ideas as for two dimensions.
