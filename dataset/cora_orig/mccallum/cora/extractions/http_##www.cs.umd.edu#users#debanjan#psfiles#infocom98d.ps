Abstract: We propose an efficient flow-control scheme for ATM ABR multicast services, especially in coping with the variation of multicast-tree structure and height, and RM-cell roundtrip delay. Unlike most other schemes that extend the existing unicast flow control, our multicast flow control does not draw on unicast solutions. An optimal second-order rate-parameter control algorithm is developed to deal with the variation in RM-cell roundtrip delay resulting from dynamic "drift" of the bottleneck location within a multicast tree. By applying two-dimensional rate control, the proposed scheme not only makes the rate process converge to the available bandwidth of the connection's most congested link, but also confines the buffer occupancy to a target regime bounded by a given (finite) buffer capacity. As a result of employing a "soft" feedback RM-cell synchronization mechanism, the proposed scheme scales well with the height of multicast tree. By setting up no-response timers and connection-update vectors, non-responsive branches can be detected and removed quickly without affecting the operation of the entire multicast tree. Using the fluid approximation, we model the proposed scheme and study the system dynamic behavior for ABR multicast service under the most stressful traffic condition. We identify the system control factors which govern the system dynamics and dominate flow-control system performance. We also develop an optimal control condition, under which the second-order rate control guarantees the monotonic convergence of system state to the target regime from an arbitrary initial value. We derive expressions for queue buildups and average throughputs in both transient and equilibrium states as functions of rate-control parameters, feedback delay, target bandwidth, and target buffer occupancy. The analytical results for both single and multiple concurrent multicast connections have shown the proposed scheme to be stable and efficient in that both the source rate and queue length at the bottleneck rapidly converge to a small neighborhood of the designated operating point. Also presented are examples demonstrating the superiority of the proposed scheme to the other existing schemes in dealing with RM-cell roundtrip delay and available bandwidth variations, and achieving fairness of buffer occupancy and link bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: Supporting ABR m-connection service poses a number of new challenges not encountered in providing ABR service on unicast connections. One of the major problems, especially in large multicast trees, is commonly known as the feedback implosion problem <ref> [1] </ref>. Since our goal is to adjust the source transmission rate to match the bottleneck link bandwidth, the source need to collect congestion feedback from all branches in the tree. Simultaneous congestion feedback from all branches can cause an implosion at the source, especially when the connection tree is large.

Reference-contexts: However, we refine the RM-cell format <ref> [6] </ref> such that it contains both the cell-rate (first-order) control and the rate-parameter (second-order) control information. In particular, two new one-bit fields, BCI (Buffer Congestion Indication) and N M Q (New Maximum Queue), are defined to deal with variations of the RM-cell roundtrip delay.

Reference-contexts: In our scheme, the feedback RM-cells are "softly synchronized" at each branching switch, which accommodates fast, complete, and efficient feedback, and makes feedback delay scale well with the height and structure of multicast tree <ref> [7] </ref>. The connection pattern specified in f dbk synch vctr is periodically updated with a "responsive" branch vector (rspnd brnch vctr) to identify and remove non-responsive branches. <p> This is because rate-increase/decrease control can only make R (t) fluctuate around the designated bandwidth, but cannot adjust the rate-fluctuation amplitude that determines Q max . In <ref> [7] </ref>, Q max is shown analytically to increase with both t and rate-increase parameter ff = dR (t) dt and can be written as a function, Q max (t; ff), or Q max (ff) for a given t . <p> of neighborhood for the target buffer occupancy Q goal is bounded by Q h gaol Q l goal t 2 ff goal q q 8ff goal Q h p q ; (4.5) where ff goal is the rate-increase parameter corresponds to Q goal . 10 Proof: The proof (available in <ref> [7] </ref>) is omitted here due to lack of space. 2 Remarks: The ff-control law is similar to, but differs from, additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease algorithm in the following terms. <p> The proof for Eq. (5.14) is omitted here for lack of space, but can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. 2 (i) peak and Q (i) peak be the peak source rate and queue length, respectively, in the i-th transient cycle, i = 1; 2; ; N ( 1) (by assuming ff 0 1 q e ff goal or ff 0 e ff goal p).

Reference-contexts: Its pseudocode is given in Table 3. 3 The System Model An ATM network with ABR m-connections flow-controlled by the proposed scheme is a dynamic feedback-control system. We model this system using the first-order fluid approximation, which models the system with coupled time-delayed differential equations <ref> [8, 9] </ref>. In this model, we use the real-valued deterministic functions R (t) and Q (t) to approximate a discrete stochastic rate process R (t) at the source and a queue length process Q (t) at the bottleneck node, respectively. <p> Here R (t) represents the fluid approximation to cell-transmission throughput. The average throughput is then given by lim t!1 1 R t 0 R (v)dv. Q (t) is an approximation to the system bottleneck queue-length process. This first-order fluid model has been shown in <ref> [8] </ref> to be a good approximation when the system is heavily-loaded. As mentioned earlier, the system bottleneck dynamically drifts around different paths of the m connection as the cross-traffic of other connections varies with time.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we explicitly include the variation of roundtrip delay in our model, and study its relationship with multicast flow-control algorithms. We discuss this issue in the next section. 4 The Second-Order Rate-Control As discussed in <ref> [17] </ref>, increasing or decreasing R (t) is not effective enough to have Q max upper bounded by C max when the system feedback delay t varies. <p> kC max , 14 (a) ff h goal and ff l goal vs. ff n -decrease pace q (b) Oscillation frequency 1 T vs. ff n -decrease pace q. 0 &lt; k &lt; 1, leads to a larger R in equilibrium state, which is also consistent with our observations in <ref> [17] </ref>, since a smaller Q goal implies a smaller ff goal . <p> Thus, together with Figure 3 (b), Figure 4 (b) also shows that the oscillation frequency is inversely proportional to the oscillation amplitude of Q (n) max . Moreover, given q a larger Q goal gives rise to a higher oscillation frequency; this is consistent with our observation in <ref> [17] </ref>. In general, the ideal case of Q goal = 1 2 (Q h goal + Q l goal ) does not always hold, depending on the initial value of ff 0 , but the ff-control algorithm guarantees the relationship Q l goal Q goal Q h goal to hold.
