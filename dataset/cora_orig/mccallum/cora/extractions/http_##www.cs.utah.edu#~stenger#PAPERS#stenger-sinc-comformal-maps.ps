Title: Conformal Maps via Sinc Methods  
Author: Frank Stenger Rainer Kress and Ian Sloan 
Abstract: In this paper we derive a new linear Fredholm integral equation for the construction of the conformal map, f, of a simply connected domain B in the complex plane to the unit disc U. This integral equation has a unique solution, and it yields a system of algebraic equations for which the matrix of the system has a uniformly bounded condition number. We describe explicit Sinc procedures for the solution of this equation second of these two equations, to construct the conformal map f on @B, the boundary of B, and for the evaluation of f in the interior of B, under the assumption that @B, consists of a finite number of analytic arcs. We also give a brief description an explicit Sinc construction which enables the computation to any desired accuracy of the inverse map F = f 1 from U to B, based on the computed f on @B.

Numerical computations based on the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation are also nonlinear (see [Ho1, VeKo1, T1]); in this case a system of nonlinear equations must be solved for the required parameters.

Reference-contexts: For example, applying the operator S to both sides of (2.10), using the equation (2.6), i.e., G = SG, and then taking the imaginary part of each side, we get H 2 &lt; S H 2 = = S H 1 : (2:11) This is, in fact, Lichtenstein's equation, <ref> [G2, Eqs. (2.4)-(2.5)] </ref>. 2.2.2 New Integral Equations Since i (u + Su) yields the boundary values of a function that is analytic in B, and in view of (2.6), we may set 7 i (u + Su) = G = H 1 + i H 2 : (2:12) By taking u <p> I., x2.1]). It has been shown in <ref> [G2, Ch. I, x3] </ref> that this operator has a simple eigenvalue 1, for which the corresponding eigenfunction is also 1. This is therefore also the case for the operator K 2 = (&lt; S) 2 , in (2.14). <p> We may note in passing, that the Fredholm alternative must be satisfied for solutions of (2.11) and (2.14) to exist, and this is, in fact, the case. Thus Lichtenstein's equation, or Eq. (2.14), as well as the other equations considered in <ref> [G2, Ch. I, x2] </ref> do not have unique solutions. On the other hand, Eq. (2.16) always has a unique solution. <p> Theorem 5.3 Equation (5.1) has a unique solution u 2 W 0 R . Proof. We know from the properties of K derived in <ref> [G2, Ch. I, x2.1] </ref> that I + K has a unique and bounded inverse, and therefore that Eq. (5.1) has a unique solution. Moreover, (2.15) then follows from (2.16).
