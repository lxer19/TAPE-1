Reference-contexts: This semantics guarantees that at least once the whole multiset will be traversed. We have followed some of the ideas of multiset processing described in <ref> [Banatre, Le Metayer, 93] </ref>, although our treatment of multisets differs in details. Example. Traverse the multiset and send each element of it downstream, one at a time. Example. Generate a set of all primes lesser or equal N.

Reference-contexts: There may be an otherwise branch as well. A conditional expression box has several input ports and a single output port. For example: Example. Select all odd numbers from a vector. This diagram is an analog of the list comprehension operator in functional languages such as Miranda <ref> [Bird, Wadler, 88] </ref>. Yet another way to express this is as follows: x: z: x &gt;= y && y&gt;=x && x &gt;= z z odd (x) x x: ... ... October 31, 1996 19 of 38 Example.

Reference-contexts: The number of iterations is determined by the number of items in the shortest aggregate. Size: R:,C: R * C ... October 31, 1996 21 of 38 Example. Checking whether a vector is a palindrome. 6 Generative Construct The Generative Construct is similar to the generative construct in SequenceL <ref> [Cooke, 96] </ref> and comprises the following parts. Initial value (s). These expressions provide the initial values of the sequence or matrix. Generating step. This includes a pattern matching the previously existing items on which the generated item depends, and a guarded expression describing the generated value (s) itself.

Reference-contexts: This also makes the concurrence within the program more visible. Data/Process dependencies imply the possibility of parallel execution of threads within the diagram. This approach to Visual Programming Language design became quite common in recent years, see e.g. <ref> [Cox, Pietrzykowski 88] </ref>, [Glaser, Smedley 95], [Kimura 95]. The data-flow paradigm is closely related to the functional programming paradigm [Bird, Wa-dler, 88]. The main difference is that a diagram may have several output ports, while a function always returns a single value.
