Title: Auxiliary Variable Methods for Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Applications  
Author: David M. Higdon 
Date: July, 1996. Revised September, 1997.  
Note: Submitted to JASA Theory and Methods  
Abstract: Suppose one wishes to sample from the density (x) using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). An auxiliary variable u and its conditional distribution (ujx) can be defined, giving the joint distribution (x; u) = (x)(ujx). A MCMC scheme which samples over this joint distribution can lead to substantial gains in efficiency compared to standard approaches. The revolutionary algorithm of Swendsen and Wang (1987) is one such example. In addition to reviewing the Swendsen-Wang algorithm and its generalizations, this paper introduces a new auxiliary variable method called partial decoupling. Two applications in Bayesian image analysis are considered. The first is a binary classification problem in which partial decoupling out performs SW and single site Metropolis. The second is a PET reconstruction which uses the gray level prior of Geman and McClure (1987). A generalized Swendsen-Wang algorithm is developed for this problem, which reduces the computing time to the point that MCMC is a viable method of posterior exploration.

Reference-contexts: Because Z (fi) is analytically intractable, prior simulation via MCMC is required to estimate Z (fi) over S using reverse logistic regression (Geyer 1991, 1997). Alternativly, thermodynamic integration (Ogata and Tanemura, 1984) or path sampling <ref> (Gelman and Meng, 1996) </ref> could have been employed. All of these methods require draws from the prior (8) which could not be done in a reasonable amount of time without the SW algorithm devised in Section 2.2.

Reference-contexts: Because of its success with Ising and Potts models, much effort has been spent on generalizing the Swendsen Wang algorithm to a wider class of models. Examples include continuous spin models (Wolff, 1989; De Meo and Oh, 1992) and gray level imaging <ref> (Green, 1992) </ref>. Below we describe the general form of the Swendsen-Wang algorithm due to Edwards and Sokal (1988).

Reference-contexts: This paper gives examples of auxiliary variable algorithms in Section 2 which show how auxiliary variable methods can lend insight into simple MCMC algorithms, and how they can lead to improvements over standard algorithms. In particular, we discuss the Swendsen-Wang algorithm <ref> (Swendsen and Wang, 1987) </ref> for Ising (1925) models and introduce partial decoupling, a modification which is more relevant to statistical inference.
