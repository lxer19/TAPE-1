Reference-contexts: For a detailed overview on the architectural layers and flow control mechanisms, the reader is referred to [1]-[3]. The hop-by-hop scheme studied in this paper is the same as the one in <ref> [4] </ref>, its purpose being to maintain a smooth flow of traffic between M nodes, termed as transmitters, attempting to send messages through a single communication channel to an adjacent node, termed as the receiver. The time axis is divided into equal segments called slots. <p> We note that this is a discrete-time stochastic control problem with partial information. It can also be viewed as one of optimal resource allocation. Special cases of this problem were addressed by Rosberg and Gopal [5] and Can-sever and Milito <ref> [4] </ref>. Rosberg and Gopal [5] considered a single transmitter with a cost function composed of the number of queued packets and the number of unutilized transmission slots that could be allocated to other links. Cansever and Milito [4] studied a problem with two transmitters and identically distributed arrival processes, and simplified <p> this problem were addressed by Rosberg and Gopal [5] and Can-sever and Milito <ref> [4] </ref>. Rosberg and Gopal [5] considered a single transmitter with a cost function composed of the number of queued packets and the number of unutilized transmission slots that could be allocated to other links. Cansever and Milito [4] studied a problem with two transmitters and identically distributed arrival processes, and simplified the cost structure in [5]. They also briefly discussed the problem with M &gt; 2 transmitters and identically distributed arrival processes. <p> The situation where the arrival processes at the M &gt; 2 transmitters are identical follows as a particular case, and unlike <ref> [4] </ref>, we find the optimal allocation policy in closed form. Systems involving transmitters whose outputs embody different priorities (e.g. voice and data) are not considered here; analysis of optimal allocation policies for models with priorities are reserved for future publication [13]. <p> Cansever and Milito <ref> [4] </ref> studied this problem but they did not solve it in explicit form. Theorem 5.1 Assume that fY (j) i=0 are i.i.d, and ff T .

They also briefly discussed the problem with M &gt; 2 transmitters and identically distributed arrival processes. In this paper we consider the general problem with M 2 transmitters, messages of equal priority, and arrival processes that are not identical. <p> By the convexity of V k (x + ), the second expression in fg on the RHS of the above identity is non-negative. Therefore V k+1 (x) is convex. This completes the proof of (b) and the theorem. 6. Conclusion In this paper, we have generalized the model of <ref> [5] </ref> to M 2. By deriving several qualitative properties of an optimal allocation policy, we have shown that finding dynamic optimal allocations for only T states suffices to completely describe an optimal allocation policy.

Reference-contexts: By virtue of Lemma 2.2, it then follows that V 1 (x) is finite. Let V (x) = inf V 1 (; x); (2:28) which is finite by Lemma 2.2. The conditions of Theorem 1 of Lippman <ref> [7] </ref> are satisfied, namely, V (x) is finite and the action space is finite; hence V (x) is achieved by a stationary policy.

Reference-contexts: This technique however, does not work in the proof of Theorem 4.3 for M &gt; 2 because V k (x + 1 ; . . . ; x + M ) is not multimodular (see <ref> [9] </ref> for definition) in Z M .
