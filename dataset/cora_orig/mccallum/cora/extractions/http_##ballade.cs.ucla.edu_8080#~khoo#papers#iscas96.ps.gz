Abstract: A simplified binary to signed-powers-of-two (SPT) conversion circuit for multiplierless adaptive filters is presented. The proposed conversion algorithm does not have a carry propagate chain, which is inherent in conventional SPT conversion algorithms that give minimal representation y . The proposed algorithm is therefore highly suitable for use in high-speed systems. The numbers representable by our proposed conversion algorithm are only slightly fewer than those representable by the optimal SPT conversion. For adaptive filtering applications, due to the adaptive nature of the coefficients, the performance of the filters employing our proposed and the optimal SPT conversion is comparable. This is verified with simulation results for two examples.

INTRODUCTION It is well known that the complexity of a digital filter can be reduced by expressing its coefficients as sums of signed powers-of-two z (SPT) terms <ref> [1] </ref>. The resulting filter requires no multiplier for coefficient multiplications and enjoys a saving in silicon area when implemented in VLSI.

However, the algorithm, as with other algorithms that convert a binary number to its minimal signed-digit representation without having some form of "look-ahead" capability, has a carry ripple chain where the carry is propagated across the entire word in the worst case.

Reference-contexts: We assumed an allowable bandwidth for transmission of 50 MHz, so a square-root Nyquist Filter of roll-off factor 0.25 was used in both transmitter and receiver to remove inter-symbol interference (ISI).
