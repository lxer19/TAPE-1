Title: The Smart Access Memory: An Intelligent RAM for Nearest Neighbor Database Searching  
Author: Aaron Lipman and Woodward Yang 
Abstract: The nearest neighbor algorithm is well suited to an IRAM implementation, given its high bandwidth requirement between memory and processing. We have designed and implemented the Smart Access Memory (SAM) chip to retrieve the k nearest neighbors to a query point in a database of example data vectors by integrating 64 bit- serial processors, 4096 sorting units, and 16Mb of memory using a 0.35m commercial DRAM process (the 1.6mm fi 1.6mm chip is currently in fabrication.) The 800K transistor processor array can be clocked at speeds between 100- 200MHz providing an internal memory bandwidth of 6.4- 12.8Gb/s. This approach also allows for multiple chips to be used in parallel, and a system of 16 SAM chips can accelerate a brute-force nearest neighbor search by over three orders of magnitude compared to a highly optimized software implementation on a 100MHz PA-RISC workstation.

Reference-contexts: This can be a memory intensive task as often exhaustive searches of the database must be performed to retrieve the nearest neighbor matches, particularly for high-dimensional data <ref> [1] </ref> [3]. Low dimensional data can be organized into tree-like structures for efficient retrieval on the order O (log N ) where N is the number of vectors in the database.

Reference-contexts: The reset signal can be passed among neighboring routers to synchronize a grid of routers. The SAM chip contains 4096 of these routers organized in a 64 fi 64 grid to maintain the top-64 results <ref> [2] </ref>. The sorters operate in a systolic fashion, so a delay skew must be introduced into the architecture. A sample sorting queue is shown in figure 5. This 3 fi 3 grid holds the sorter. three smalles 3b numbers it sees.
