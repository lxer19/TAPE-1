Reference-contexts: In terms of Eulerian graphs we obtain criteria for a plan to be geographic, and we also give an algorithm of reconstruction a map from a geographic plan. The case when this map is unique is singled out. Some of these results were announced in <ref> [1] </ref>. 2. Graphs. Finite undirected graphs are considered. Loops and nmultiple edges are allowed. We need the following concepts; for more details see for instance [2; ch.1, x1; ch.2, xx1 3, and ch.7, x1].

Reference-contexts: The case when this map is unique is singled out. Some of these results were announced in [1]. 2. Graphs. Finite undirected graphs are considered. Loops and nmultiple edges are allowed. We need the following concepts; for more details see for instance <ref> [2; ch.1, x1; ch.2, xx1 3, and ch.7, x1] </ref>. A cyclic sequence of alternating vertices and edges in which any adjacent edge and vertex are incident is called a closed route. A closed route in which all the edges are different is called a cycle. <p> A cycle containing all the vertices of a graph, and a graph itself in which such a cycle exists, are called Eulerian. Clearly, an Eulerian graph must be connected. Criteria for a connected graph to be Eulerian are given by the following Lemma (see, for instance, <ref> [2, Theorem 7.1] </ref>). Lemma 1. For a connected graph three properties are equivalent: a) The graph is Eulerian. b) There exist a collection of simple cycles such that their edge-sets represent a partition of the edge-set of the graph. c) All vertices have even degrees. 3. Surfaces. <p> Surfaces. The topological classification of surfaces (i.e. two-dimensional,compact, smooth manifolds without boundary) is well known; see, for instance, <ref> [2, ch.3] </ref>. They are divided into orientable: (S p ; p = 0; 1; 2; ), and nonorientable (C q ; q = 1; 2; ). For example, S 0 is a sphere, S 1 is a torus, C 1 is a projective plane, C 2 is a Klein bottle.

Reference-contexts: The plane representation of maps. The classical combinatorial approach to surfaces will be considered here briefly; see more details in <ref> [3] </ref>, chapter 3. Fix few polygons 6 on a plane. Each one can have any number of edges including even 2 and 1. The sum of all these numbers is supposed to be even, and the set of all the edges is supposed to be divided into pairs. <p> In other words, it is possible to apply few times operation c) above in such a way that any letter a will occur twice only in combination (a; a), but not (a; a) or (a; a). One can find out in <ref> [3] </ref> more operations which preserve only the surface given by a map but not the map itself. These operations enable us to obtain the classification given in x3. The surfaces S p and C q can be represented by the following normal forms.

Reference-contexts: The first three plans can be induced by maps on toruses; see examples 20.7-20.9 and also <ref> [4] </ref>. Let us check that the fourth plan can not. Really, there is only one country.
