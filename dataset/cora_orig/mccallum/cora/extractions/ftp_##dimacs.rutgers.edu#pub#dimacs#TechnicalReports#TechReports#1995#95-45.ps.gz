Reference-contexts: The inequality t (H) -(H) is trivial. If H is a finite set of intervals on a line, then t (H) = -(H) as it was first observed by Gallai (see Hajnal and Suranyi <ref> [HaS] </ref>). This observation, with its algebraic proof, became an important theorem in the theory of perfect graphs. We note that the result can be extended to arbitrary families of closed intervals on a line (see e.g. [Kar]). <p> Analogously to f (d; k) we define f fl (d; k) = maxft (H)jH is a family of homogeneous d-intervals with -(H) = kg: Clearly f (d; k) f fl (d; k). The observation of Gallai can be stated as follows. Theorem 1.1. <ref> [HaS] </ref> f (1; k) = f fl (1; k) = k . 1 Gyarfas and Lehel [GyL1] proved that f (d; k) and f fl (d; k) are finite for every d; k 2 IN.

Reference-contexts: We have to note that a quadratic upper bound for f fl (2; k) was proved by Kostochka [Kos] earlier and later Tardos [Tar] proved a linear upper bound for the same function. Very recently Kaiser <ref> [Kai] </ref> proved f fl (d; k) d 2 k, an upper bound superior to ours. In 1965 Wegner [Weg] proposed the following problem. <p> Corollary 2.5. For any fixed d 2 we have f (d; k) = O (k d1 ). Proof. Lemma 2.3 and Theorem 2.4 yield the proof. Let us remark here that this exponential upper bound is inferior to the recent f (d; k)) d 2 k d bound in <ref> [Kai] </ref>. Even this better upper bound on f (d; k) is not known to be tight. There are however special types of families of multiple intervals for which the dependence between t and can be computed exactly. <p> A straightforward generalization of Lemma 1 in [PaT] yields that t (H) f (4; -(H)). The following statement is an improvement upon this result. In the view of the recent f (d; k) d 2 k d result in <ref> [Kai] </ref> this improvement is only by a constant factor. Lemma 3.1. For any pointed rectangular hypergraph H t (H) 2f (2; -(H)) : Proof. Let us identify the vertex set X of H with a closed set in the plane according to the definition.

In the view of the recent f (d; k) d 2 k d result in [Kai] this improvement is only by a constant factor. Lemma 3.1. <p> We may assume that the common point is the origin (0; 0). The idea behind the proof is the following. With a method similar to that of described in <ref> [PaT] </ref> we may replace H with a 4-interval hypergraph H 1 that has the same packing and transversal number as H. The crucial observation is that restricting H 1 to two lines which represent two neighboring quadrants one obtains an ordered 2-interval hypergraph.
