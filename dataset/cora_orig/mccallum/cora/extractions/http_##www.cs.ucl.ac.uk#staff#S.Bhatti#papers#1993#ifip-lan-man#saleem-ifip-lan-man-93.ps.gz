Abstract: OSI provides a powerful object-oriented management model that is infinitely scalable and extensible but is only now beginning to see widespread support. The Internet model has followed a less powerful but simpler approach which has led to an already large installed base of manageable equipment. In the future, even if OSI becomes ubiquitous, the two solutions will have to coexist as the level of investment on Internet management technology is already high. A natural path for this coexistence is to provide a conversion from the Internet to the OSI model and use proxy systems that will provide an OSI view of all existing Internet-manageable resources. This paper discusses how the generation of such proxy systems can be automated through a set of well defined conversion rules and suitable object-oriented infrastructure in the form of a generic management platform. The approach followed for the proxy system is mostly stateless, with optimised cacheing for scoping of transient objects and filtering. Complex issues are highlighted.

Reference-contexts: The current investment on Internet management technology is already high enough to suggest that - -- a coexistence of the two solutions should be expected in the years to come. The scene for this coexistence was first set by the specification of the Internet MIB in OSI form <ref> [1] </ref> two years ago which suggested that such a translation was possible. We actually designed and implemented immediately an OSI agent providing a view of the "standard" Internet MIB in OSI fashion in order to experiment with that approach.

Our approach for the conversion is similar but our system architecture is different as it takes the whole procedure a step further by suggesting mechanisms to automate it completely.

Reference-contexts: Managed object classes are formally specified in an ASN.1 template language known as Guidelines for the Definition of Managed Objects (GDMO) <ref> [7] </ref>. There are two main aspects in management information modeling: inheritance and containment. All managed object classes form a global inheritance tree whose root is the top object class that contains self describing information for every object instance.

Reference-contexts: This scheme guarantees uniqueness of names and ensures that all the MIB instances are lexicographically ordered. MIB instances are held by agent applications and are accessed by manager ones. Management information is conveyed by the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) <ref> [8] </ref> which supports the following operations: - -- iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii SNMP Operation Purpose iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii Get retrieve information Get-Next retrieve information by MIB traversal Set set variable values or create/delete table entries Trap inform manager of an event iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii The Trap is an asynchronous operation similar to the OSI M-Event-Report while the rest

Reference-contexts: Traps in SNMP are not configurable and also are not guaranteed to be received by managers as an unreliable connectionless transport mechanism is used (the Internet UDP <ref> [9] </ref>). As such, managers have to resort to low frequency polling. This difference has repercussions on the complexity of managing and managed systems (managers/agents), SNMP agents being simple and shifting all the complexity to manager applications, which is one of reasons for the current proliferation of SNMP-manageable devices.

Reference-contexts: However, this approach requires extra complexity to be built in managers and assumes "dual-stack" support as the manager will need separate communications infrastructure for both the OSI and Internet worlds. Such an approach is adopted by the X/Open XMP <ref> [10] </ref> Application Program Interface (API) which provides uniform access to CMIS and SNMP services.

Reference-contexts: These are separate managed objects (specific event log records according to the event type) and their information may be transmitted to a manager through an event report management operation or they may be stored locally in logs according to the Event Report <ref> [11] </ref> and Log Control [12] functions in the agent. In the Internet model, traps are roughly equivalent to notifications but these are few and their emission cannot be dynamically controlled by a manager. <p> The real power of the OSI model lies in the features known as scoping and filtering. Implementing such issues and also synchronisation, Event Reporting <ref> [11] </ref> and other generic systems management functions is a difficult issue for OSI agents in general. Proxy systems pose an additional problem because of the interactions required through the network at the agent's back-end to access the "loosely-coupled" resources.

Reference-contexts: Since OSI uses an object-oriented specification methodology, using object-oriented design methods and implementation technology can result in harnessing its power and complexity behind well though-out Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and providing a generic and extensible management platform. The OSI Management Information Service (OSIMIS) <ref> [13] </ref> platform does exactly that, and the support provided for the development of management agents is known as the Generic Managed System (GMS). 5.1 Support for event-driven system organisation Using object-oriented design methodology, the Coordinator/Knowledge Source abstraction in the GMS may be used to organise communication with the real resource.

Reference-contexts: Managed object instances are represented internally as C++ <ref> [14] </ref> object instances linked in a containment tree. Operations such as scoping and filtering are handled by the agent which may request that an object refreshes its subordinates if these are transient objects or refresh the contents of an object before filtering.

Reference-contexts: For this to be used via CMIP, the community name could be sent in the access control parameter of a CMIS call. However, a method for performing this function is currently undefined. Also, the much stronger OSI Access Control <ref> [15] </ref> is weakened by the use of SNMP, so it may be pointless to use the OSI Access Control model on the Converted MIB at the gateway when the access to the SNMP agent is not as strongly protected. 7.4 MIB Images in the Gateway One can envisage a scenario where
