Abstract: Recognition systems attempt to recover information about the identity of the observed objects and their location in the environment. A fundamental problem in recognition is the following. Given a correspondence between some portions of an object model and some portions of an image, determine whether the image contains an instance of the object, and, in case it does, determine the transformation that relates the model to the image. The current approaches to this problem are divided into methods that use "global" properties of the object (e.g., centroid and moments of inertia) and methods that use "local" properties of the object (e.g., corners and line segments). Global properties are sensitive to occlusion and, specifically, to self occlusion. Local properties are difficult to locate reliably, and their matching involves intensive computation. A novel method for recognition that uses region information is presented. In our approach the model is divided into volumes, and the image is divided into regions. Given a match between subsets of volumes and regions (without any explicit correspondence between different pieces of the regions) the alignment transformation is computed. The method applies to planar objects under similarity, affine, and projective transformations and to projections of 3-D objects undergoing affine and projective transformations. The new approach combines many of the advantages of the previous two approaches, while avoiding some of their pitfalls. Like the global methods, our approach makes use of region information that reflects the true shape of the object. But like local methods, our approach can handle occlusion. fl A version of this paper is to appear in ICCV '95, copyright (c) 1995 by IEEE.

Reference-contexts: In the curved case we will want to sample the set of constraints. The issue of sampling is addressed in <ref> [1] </ref>. Given a finite set of constraints ~g T we seek a vector of parameters ~w that is consistent with the constraints. <p> In the projective case, a degeneracy occurs when the tangent lines intersect at any point in the plane. The proof of these theorems is somewhat complex, and is given in <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.3.4 Points and line segments When applying our method we may wish to use points or line segments in addition to volumes and regions.

Reference-contexts: Because our algorithm is implemented by reducing our problem to a linear program, it can be run quite efficiently. Our method is based on Baird's <ref> [6] </ref> insight that matching features to convex regions leads to linear constraints on the set of possible transformations relating the two. Cass [11] used this insight to produce the first polynomial-time algorithm guaranteed to match the maximum number of consistent features. <p> = a b y + c The forward constraint in this case is given by A (ax + by + c) + B (bx + ay + d) + C 0: (5) This constraint is linear in the transformation parameters. (This parameterization is used and explained, for example, in Baird <ref> [6] </ref>. Baird pointed out that a linear bound on the location of a transformed model point leads to a linear constraint on the feasible transformations).

Reference-contexts: Our method is based on Baird's [6] insight that matching features to convex regions leads to linear constraints on the set of possible transformations relating the two. Cass [11] used this insight to produce the first polynomial-time algorithm guaranteed to match the maximum number of consistent features. Breuel <ref> [9] </ref> also uses these insights to make potentially exponential constraint-based search into a worst-case polynomial time algorithm. However, as described above, our work differs significantly from these approaches, which focus on matching simple, local features, and do not make use of region-based information.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the possible ranges of the tangent vectors must intersect. 5 Experiments To test the scheme we took pictures of a number of roughly planar objects. We first processed these images using Canny's edge detector <ref> [10] </ref>. We then constructed polygonal approximations to the edges using Pavlidis and Horowitz's [32] split-and-merge algorithm. The resulting polygons approximate the original edges to within two pixels. Then, we extracted the roughly 31 convex structures using Jacobs's grouping system [24]. The matching between the regions was specified manually.

Reference-contexts: Since V 1 and V 2 are both closed and convex, and since T is a continuous transformation mapping these two volumes to inside themselves then, by Brouwer's fixed point theorem <ref> [12] </ref>, there exist two points ~p 1 2 V 1 and ~p 2 2 V 2 that are fixed with respect to T , that is, (Note that ~p 1 6= ~p 2 since V 1 and V 2 are distinct.) Two points determine a similarity transformation uniquely.

Reference-contexts: such a linear program is by introducing an additional unknown, , in the following way. max (19) A solution to (18) exists if and only if a solution to (19) with 0 exists. (Note that other objective functions, e.g., the perceptron function, can be used for recovering ~w, see e.g., <ref> [14] </ref> for a discussion of solutions to the linear discriminant functions problem.) 12 When 0 its value represents the minimal distance of a point to any line bounding the region (Figure 3). Maximizing amounts to attempting to contract the model volume inside the image region as much as possible.
