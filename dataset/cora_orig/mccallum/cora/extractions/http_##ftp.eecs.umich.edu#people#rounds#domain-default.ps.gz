Reference-contexts: Among the papers on default systems in the current literature, one which seems to use methods most closely allied to ours is a paper of Marek, Nerode, and Remmel (MNR) [12]. Inspired by Reiter's original work [15], and by that of Apt <ref> [1] </ref>, MNR generalize default systems using "tokens" in the way we have outlined. They do not assume that a logical language is pre- specified. <p> Consider the default reals. In the ideal domain, we refer to elements by the real intervals to which they are isomorphic. The only extension of <ref> [1; 2] </ref> would be [0; 1]; the interval [2; 0:5] would have [0; 0:5] as an extension, and there would be 2 extensions of [2; 4], namely [0; 1] and [; ]. These examples are intended to wean the reader away from the view of defaults as default logic. <p> Consider the default reals.

Reference-contexts: Most researchers probably suspect that real reasoning is semantic. We suggest that instead of thinking about formal proofs, one should consider the more general notion of information, a move suggested by the theory of denotational semantics of programming languages, and also by situation theory <ref> [2] </ref>. Toward this end, we introduce the concept of default information structures. These extend the notion of Scott's information systems [18], a general framework accounting for semantic information in the monotonic world. Information systems give an exact characterization of Scott domains, which are certain kinds of complete algebraic partial orders. <p> Consider the default reals.

Reference-contexts: It consists of a set of information tokens, an entailment relation like that specified in Definition 2.1, and an extra consistency predicate. We use the definition given in Larsen and Winskel <ref> [8] </ref>, which differs slightly from the original one given by Scott.

Reference-contexts: There is, however, one case in which they are the same: the class of precondition-free default structures, where the default relations are of the form : a : We also consider the relationship between dilations and the so-called em modified extensions of Lukaszewicz <ref> [9] </ref>. In this case there are no inclusions between dilations and modified extensions. 7 Section 7 contains some preliminary results on the class of partial orders determined by rational default information structures. <p> We also compare dilations with a modified notion of extension due to Lukaszewicz <ref> [9] </ref>. 6.1 Minimality of Extensions Given a default information structure A = (A; ; `), what exactly is the relationship between dilations and extensions?

Reference-contexts: of default logic deals with one theory at a time, and hence does not provide an account of the evolution of information. (We recognize that researchers in the semantics of beliefs have considered the dynamics of epistemic states, in the form of theories of belief revision and theory change (e.g. <ref> [11] </ref>). Default logic work, though, has not had a similar emphasis.) 4. Default logic is proof-oriented. It is this obstacle which is most difficult to remove. We want to espouse the view of default rules as algorithms for building belief spaces.

Reference-contexts: Of course, the tool has already proved its worth in the standard theory of domains. Among the papers on default systems in the current literature, one which seems to use methods most closely allied to ours is a paper of Marek, Nerode, and Remmel (MNR) <ref> [12] </ref>. Inspired by Reiter's original work [15], and by that of Apt [1], MNR generalize default systems using "tokens" in the way we have outlined. They do not assume that a logical language is pre- specified.

Reference-contexts: It also allows us to use compactness considerations in our results, as the notion of ideal element in domain theory presumes a compactness property. As a short example of the advantages of assuming a consistency predicate, consider the basic type of default rule used in the Theorist system <ref> [13] </ref>: : a : The meaning is very clear: if the fact a is consistent, then believe it.

Reference-contexts: Support for this position comes from the paper of Reiter and Criscuolo <ref> [14] </ref>. This was the original paper introducing semi-normal default theories. Although the definition of general default rules in that paper refers to separate consistency of each of the justifications, none of the examples ever use it. All of them require joint consistency: that a conjunction of justifications be consistent.

Reference-contexts: We therefore replace extensions with a new notion, called dilations. Dilations are a weakening of the idea of extension. We give the formal definition in Section 3, but some discussion is in order now. We quote Reiter <ref> [15, sec. 1.3] </ref> on the subject of extensions: 3 The role of a default is to fill in some of the gaps in the knowledge base : : : so as to permit the inferences necessary to act. <p> Among the papers on default systems in the current literature, one which seems to use methods most closely allied to ours is a paper of Marek, Nerode, and Remmel (MNR) [12]. Inspired by Reiter's original work <ref> [15] </ref>, and by that of Apt [1], MNR generalize default systems using "tokens" in the way we have outlined. They do not assume that a logical language is pre- specified. <p> Section 4 recasts the definition of extension in first-order default logic in terms of information; this is in preparation for the more robust notion of dilation to follow. Two definitions of extensions as fixed points of certain operators are given. These lead us to generalize a characterization of Reiter <ref> [15] </ref>, who shows that these two operators, in the setting of default logic, have the same fixed points. We show a much stronger result in the setting of information systems, these operators are identical.

Reference-contexts: Just as program specifications are given by a logic of such a domain, we think that a logic for default reasoning should really speak about things like the dilation relation generated by a default information system. We have some results in this direction, which will appear in subsequent papers <ref> [17, 16] </ref>. Given this new perspective, it is perhaps not absolutely crucial to find "the right" notion of generalized extension, which will form "the" class of belief spaces generated by, say, semi-normal information systems. Our perspective, instead, leads us to other criteria.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we have found an application for our notion of default models. This involves a family of modal logics which use default information systems as their semantics. This work will appear shortly <ref> [17] </ref> . We proceed with a review of some problems with default logic. 1.2 Faults of Default Logic The default logic notion of extension is intended to represent the full consequences of our beliefs. <p> Just as program specifications are given by a logic of such a domain, we think that a logic for default reasoning should really speak about things like the dilation relation generated by a default information system.

Reference-contexts: Toward this end, we introduce the concept of default information structures. These extend the notion of Scott's information systems <ref> [18] </ref>, a general framework accounting for semantic information in the monotonic world. Information systems give an exact characterization of Scott domains, which are certain kinds of complete algebraic partial orders. We extend the idea to the non-monotonic world, combining ideas from default logic and ideas from domain theory.

Reference-contexts: These latter systems, fully explicated in Zhang <ref> [19] </ref>, are a generalization of information systems to account for nondeterministic information, but still monotonic. Using the notations of sequent structures, we define default information structures in Section 3.
