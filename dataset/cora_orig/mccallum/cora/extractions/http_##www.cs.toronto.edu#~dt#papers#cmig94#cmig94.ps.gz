Abstract: This paper presents a physics-based approach to anatomical surface segmentation, reconstruction, and tracking in multidimensional medical images. The approach makes use of a dynamic "balloon" model|a spherical thin-plate under tension surface spline which deforms elastically to fit the image data. The fitting process is mediated by internal forces stemming from the elastic properties of the spline and external forces which are produced from the data. The forces interact in accordance with Lagrangian equations of motion that adjust the model's deformational degrees of freedom to fit the data. We employ the finite element method to represent the continuous surface in the form of weighted sums of local polynomial basis functions. We use a quintic triangular finite element whose nodal variables include positions as well as the first and second partial derivatives of the surface. We describe a system, implemented on a high performance graphics workstation, which applies the model fitting technique to the segmentation of the cardiac LV surface in volume (3D) CT images and LV tracking in dynamic volume (4D) CT images to estimate its nonrigid motion over the cardiac cycle. The system features a graphical user interface which minimizes error by affording specialist users interactive control over the dynamic model fitting process.

Reference-contexts: The traditional automatic segmentation methods, such as density thresholding and the application of (2D or 3D) edge operators, have many well-known problems. Edge detection and the more recent marching cube <ref> [3] </ref> technique reduce volume data into something that is more readily displayed through 3D graphics, such as surface elements. <p> The surface model approximates the data across all the slices; hence, it is much less sensitive to noise than locally interpolatory segmentation schemes <ref> [3] </ref>. An extracted surface model with the aforementioned properties provides many options for quantitative analysis of the anatomic object. In cardiology, for instance, volumetric parameters (end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, stroke volume, and ejection ratio) are diagnostically significant, while surface curvature extrema often have anatomical significance.

Reference-contexts: Deformable surface models are a promising approach to extracting anatomically meaningful structures from volume data. The dynamic form of the deformable model fitting technique described in this paper was first introduced by Terzopoulos, Witkin, and Kass <ref> [7] </ref>. They proposed a dynamic deformable cylinder model constructed from generalized splines, along with force field techniques to fit the model to image data. This dynamic approach is being pursued by several researchers in computational vision [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. <p> towards significant 3D intensity edges (gradients) in some region of an image function I (x; y; z) we construct a 3D potential function P (x; y; z) = 1 kr (G oe fl I)k + 2 kO MD fl Ik (28) whose potential valleys (minima) coincide with the object surface <ref> [7] </ref>. In the first term on the right hand side of (28), G oe denotes a 3D Gaussian smoothing filter of characteristic width oe. This filter broadens or narrows the potential valleys of this term thus determining the extent of the region of attraction of the intensity gradient. <p> If the model is not close enough to the surface of the object, the short-range image forces defined previously may not attract it. For this reason, an internal pressure force is used to "inflate" the balloon model towards the object surface <ref> [7] </ref> [10]. The force takes the form f = 1 n (u; v); (30) where n (u; v) is the unit normal vector to the model surface at the point x (u; v), and 1 is the amplitude of this force.

If 1 is negative, the force will deflate the balloon.

Reference-contexts: Cohen and Cohen fit a cylindrical, bicubic Hermitian finite element based surface to MRI images of the LV. Another relevant deformable model is the discrete model developed by Miller et al. <ref> [21] </ref>, which is subdivided and fitted to CT volume images by a relaxation process that minimizes a set of constraints such as the distance to the data or the local curvature of the model.

Reference-contexts: Note, however, that although these dynamics equations serve well in model fitting and tracking using multidimensional data sets, we make no attempt to model the actual biomechanical properties of the anatomical structure under consideration (such as the cardiac LV; see, e.g., <ref> [22] </ref>). 3 Dynamic Deformable Balloon Model The balloon model that we develop in this paper is constructed of the simulated thin-plate material under tension. The deformation energy of the material serves as a constraint which compels the model to vary smoothly almost everywhere.

Reference-contexts: A disadvantage of the finite difference approach is that the continuity of the solution between nodes is not made explicit. The finite element method, on the other hand, provides continuous surface approximations; that is, the method approximates the unknown function x in terms of combinations of local basis functions <ref> [23] </ref>. To apply the finite element method to our models, we tessellate the continuous material domain (u; v) into a mesh of M element subdomains E j . <p> u i C 7 where =2 v =2 and u &lt; and a 0 is a radius parameter. 5.1 Triangular C 1 Finite Element (u ,v ) 3 3 (u ,v ) 1 1 (1,0)(0,0) v x h We use a fifth-order triangular finite element to implement the balloon model <ref> [23] </ref>. In view of the form of the deformation energy (1) which leads to the strain vector (13), it is natural to choose as nodal variables x, along with its first and second parametric partial derivatives evaluated at each node i. <p> (as numbered in the figure), and the local nodal variable vector becomes q i (t) = x &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i &gt; The transformation from global to local coordinates is q i = T i q i (24) where the transformation matrix T i is specified in <ref> [23] </ref> (pp. 100-101). Concatenating the q i at each of the three nodes of element j, we obtain the 18-dimensional element nodal vector q j 1 ; q &gt; 3 ] &gt; . <p> Note that the polynomial basis of the element is complete up to fourth-order terms and contains three fifth-order terms <ref> [23] </ref>. The trial functions are C 1 within elements and they ensure C 1 continuity between elements. Since (1) contains up to second order derivatives, the element is conforming. <p> These integrals are approximated using Gauss-Legendre quadrature rules <ref> [23] </ref>. 5.2 Model Refinement Our implementation allows the balloon model to be refined during the fitting process by subdividing the triangular elements. Each element spawns 4 child elements by connecting the midpoints of its 3 edges (Fig. 3). This process may be applied recursively to each child element.

Reference-contexts: This filter broadens or narrows the potential valleys of this term thus determining the extent of the region of attraction of the intensity gradient. Typically, the attraction has a relatively short range. In the second term, a 3D edge detector, the 3D Monga-Deriche (MD) operator <ref> [24] </ref>, is applied to the image data to produce a 3D intensity edge field. The potential valleys of this term tend to be narrow and deep, complementing (and coinciding with) the wider but more shallow valleys produced by the first term.

Reference-contexts: extracted from the model surface and used as a guide when fitting the model to subsequent volumes in the sequence. * the model can be generalized so that it subdivides elements in areas undergoing stretching or bending or merge elements in areas that are less curved (cf. adaptive meshes 22 <ref> [29, 30, 31] </ref>). This would enable the elements to better follow the motion of the data points and allow for correspondence recovery. Obviously, it is difficult to assess the accuracy of our LV reconstruction and tracking results from a single 4D dataset.
