Abstract: We present efficient zero-knowledge proof systems for quasi-safe prime products and other related languages. Quasi-safe primes are a relaxation of safe primes, a class of prime numbers useful in many cryptographic applications. More specifically we present the first simple and efficient zero-knowledge proof that an alleged RSA modulus is of the correct form, i.e. the product of two primes. All previously known proof enforced only that the modulus was the product of two prime powers. We then present a zero-knowledge proof that the primes composing the RSA modulus are quasi-safe. Our proof systems achieve higher security and better efficiency than all previously known ones. In particular, all our proof systems are perfect or statistical zero-knowledge, meaning that even a computationally unbounded adversary cannot extract any information from the proofs. Moreover, our proof systems are extremely efficient because they do not use general reductions to NP-complete problems, can be easily parallelized preserving zero-knowledge, and are non-interactive for computationally unbounded provers. The prover can also be efficiently implemented given some trapdoor information and using very little interaction. We demonstrate the applicability of quasi-safe primes by showing how they can be effectively used in the context of RSA based undeniable signatures to enforce the use of "good" public keys, i.e., keys such that if a signer can convince a recipient of the validity of a signature, then he won't be able to subsequently deny the same signature in case of a dispute.

Reference-contexts: Namely, an odd prime P = 2 ^p + 1 is quasi-safe if ^p is a prime power, i.e., ^p = p ff for some prime p. We give an efficient one-sided error non-interactive statistical zero-knowledge (NIZK <ref> [1] </ref>) proof system for the language of quasi-safe prime products N = P Q such that P = 2p ff + 1; Q = 2q fi + 1; p; q are distinct odd primes satisfying P; Q; p; q 6 1 (mod 8), P 6 Q (mod 8) and p 6 <p> The reader is referred to <ref> [1] </ref> for a complete description. In a non-interactive proof system, a prover wants to convince a verifier that a string x (the common input) belongs to some language L. <p> The four stages can be run simultaneously. If the desired soundness error probability is *, each stage must be repeated enough times to make the error probability of each stage smaller than *=4. This can be efficiently done in parallel given the parallel composition properties of NIZK proofs <ref> [1] </ref>. The soundness error can be easily bounded in stages 2 and 4 where the error probability is a constant. In stage 4, the soundness error can be re duced if we assume p; q &gt; d for some constant d.

Reference-contexts: For example, the use of safe primes has been recommended in the choice of RSA moduli because prime products N = P Q are believed to be harder to factor when P and Q are safe. The undeniable signature scheme in <ref> [3] </ref> requires the RSA modulus to be the product of safe primes in order to achieve undeniability. [2] uses safe prime products to prove modular polynomial relations in zero-knowledge. <p> In particular we would like to be able to prove that a number is a safe prime product in zero-knowledge [4]. Certifying a number N = P Q as the product of two safe primes is of critical importance in applications such as the undeniable signature scheme in <ref> [3] </ref>, where if P and Q are not safe the signer can convince somebody of the validity of a signature, and subsequently deny the same signature in case of a dispute. <p> However, in our proof system the prover has only to loose by not following the above protocol because if x 62 hgi the verifier will certainly reject the input in stage 4 of the proof system. 5 Applications: Undeniable Signatures In <ref> [3] </ref> a new undeniable signature scheme was presented based on the RSA signature algorithm. The scheme is proven secure under the assumption that the composite modulus N is the product of two safe primes P and Q. <p> This assumption is needed in order to bound the probability of cheating by the prover during the confirmation and denial protocol. While in general one trusts the prover to choose a "safe" N as it appears to be in his own interest, 11 the undeniable signature scheme of <ref> [3] </ref> is an example of a scheme where the prover might have an interest in choosing N differently as that could give him the possibility to deny valid signatures. A problem left open in [3] was how to make sure that the signer had chosen N correctly 1 . In [3] <p> N as it appears to be in his own interest, 11 the undeniable signature scheme of <ref> [3] </ref> is an example of a scheme where the prover might have an interest in choosing N differently as that could give him the possibility to deny valid signatures. A problem left open in [3] was how to make sure that the signer had chosen N correctly 1 . In [3] the proven bound on the probability of cheating is O (1) p where N = P Q and P = 2p + 1 and Q = 2q + 1, p &lt; q. <p> <ref> [3] </ref> is an example of a scheme where the prover might have an interest in choosing N differently as that could give him the possibility to deny valid signatures. A problem left open in [3] was how to make sure that the signer had chosen N correctly 1 . In [3] the proven bound on the probability of cheating is O (1) p where N = P Q and P = 2p + 1 and Q = 2q + 1, p &lt; q. <p> That is the probability of cheating for the prover remains O (1) p where N = P Q and P = 2p ff + 1, Q = 2q fi + 1, p &lt; q. However in <ref> [3] </ref> one could say that jpj = O (jN j) and from that establish that the probability of error was negligible. <p> Thus effectively quasi-safe primes are sufficient for the security of the <ref> [3] </ref> undeniable signature scheme.
