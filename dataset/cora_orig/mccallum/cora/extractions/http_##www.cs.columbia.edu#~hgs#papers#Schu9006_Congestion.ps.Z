Abstract: Traditional feedback congestion control is not suitable for high-speed networks due to their high bandwidth-to-delay ratio. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of locally controlling short-term congestion for loss-tolerant, but delay-sensitive traffic such as packet voice through selective discarding of packets based on the virtual work found by a packet on arrival to a queue (local deadlines). By analysis and simulation of a multi-stage virtual circuit it is shown that this approach can cut voice-tolerable loss rates in half for high loads. Further, we show that the simple case of using the same local deadline throughout the network performs nearly as well as taking reduced interior traffic into consideration and optimizing loss performance over a set of heterogeneous local deadlines. By example, the issue of establishing control parameters at call setup time is also considered.

Reference-contexts: For speech coded with PCM and adaptive DPCM, losses from 2 to 5% are tolerable without interpolation, while odd-even interpolation raises the threshold of objectionable loss to between 5% and 10% <ref> [1] </ref>. Compressed video is far less tolerant of lost packets. A variable-rate DPCM coder operating at around 30 Mbits/second [2] is designed for a loss rate of below 10 11 .

Reference-contexts: The parameter space investigated will cover the first and third possibility, as the second requires "travel history" to be carried with each packet. We note that in a high-speed wide-area environment, control measures such as backpressure or choke packets <ref> [3] </ref> lose effectiveness since the high delay-to-bandwidth ratio may render the feedback information obsolete by the time it reaches the controlling agent. Because of this, local, distributed control mechanisms are preferable to centralized algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Packet arrivals to all nodes are approximated by Poisson processes with arrival rate i . Modeling a superposition of SAD (speech activity detection) voice sources as a Poisson source leads to overly optimistic estimates in the case of a voice multiplexer <ref> [4] </ref>. However, for the case of voice trunks considered here, the number of voice sources is possibly two orders of magnitude higher than that found at the T1 rate (1.544 Mbps) multiplexer studied by [5] and others. <p> Thus, according to the arguments of [6], we can conclude that for short time spans, the superposition process is adequately modeled by a Poisson process. The discarding mechanism further limits the interaction period of packets in the queue, improving the approximation <ref> [4] </ref>. Even assuming that the input traffic to the first node is indeed modeled accurately by a Poisson source, packet dropping at the intermediate nodes will make the input stream to subsequent nodes non-Poisson.

From the examples reported in <ref> [19] </ref>, it can be concluded that even for high loads ( = 0:9) and short VCs such as M = 2, heterogeneous deadline yield less than 1% improvement over using a homogeneous t . <p> It was shown that the fraction of lost packets could be reduced substantially for suitable traffic types and virtual circuit size. Even if the exact load is not known, a static overload control mechanism can ameliorate the effects of temporary overload situations. In related work <ref> [19] </ref>, it is shown that analysis technique and performance gains carry over to the case of fixed packet sizes.

Reference-contexts: Here, the time a packet spends waiting for service to begin is bounded by t i . Results for this system are summarized in <ref> [20] </ref> (called FIFO-TO there). Among the policies for a single queue studied in that paper, FIFO-BW performed best in the sense of maximizing the throughput of packets meeting their deadlines, suggesting that it may be a good candidate for a tandem system as well. <p> Recognizing u (t t) = 1 u (t t ), the waiting time in the Laplace domain is derived: w (sjJ ) = ff - (s+-)t i Extending the results in <ref> [20] </ref>, the nth moment can be writ ten as n n E [w t e -t where (n; x) is the complementary incomplete Gamma function.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, it was attempted to obtain tight bounds on the tail of the waiting time distribution by using the moment generating function in the Chernoff bound or higher moments in Bienayme's inequality <ref> [21] </ref>. Both produced bounds too loose to judge the benefits of applying queue control via local deadlines. An algebraic inversion of the Laplace-transform expression proved more fruitful. This was possible because unlike the transform for the FIFO-BS case (Eq. (3)), Eq. (4) is rational and thus amenable to closed-form expansion.
