Reference-contexts: In conformity with scale-space theory all experiments are based on the Gaussian filter family [8], a complete, proper subset of Schwartz' space. For an analysis of error propagation in computing Gaussian derivatives the reader is referred to Blom et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. Below "error" is defined as "deviation from the model". No attempt is made to relate it quantitatively to a theoretical prediction of the aforementioned fundamental limitation. To compensate for this two related experiments are carried out on synthetic data.

Reference-contexts: For a scalar function f the Lie derivative is given by L v f = rf v, in which r denotes the spatiotemporal gradient operator. For a density field % one has L v % = r (%v) <ref> [3] </ref>. The original "Horn & Schunck equation" [6, 7, 9] is obtained by identifying f or % with the image function and setting its Lie derivative equal to zero under the additional assumption that the temporal component of the vector field equals one. Classical derivatives are ill-posed.

Reference-contexts: Topological duality subjected to a few plausible constraints produces the familiar Gaussian scale-space paradigm (viz. postulate a unique, positive filter consistent with Schwartz' theory and require algebraic closure <ref> [4] </ref>). In x2.1 it is extended to cope with motion. Once a generic data format has been established, solutions to particular tasks typically depend on fewer degrees of freedom than actually available (provided one has sufficient data and knowledge).

Reference-contexts: In particular, if two source configurations induce identical mappings they are considered equivalent ("metamerism"). This can be exploited so as to hide irrelevant grid details and alleviate the impact of noise (robustness). 2 The emphasis is on global methodology. Technical details can be found in a recent publi-cation <ref> [5] </ref>. 2 Theory Duality paradigms account for the inner workings of the filtering stage used to define data format. As such they should be contrasted with conventional "preprocessing" or "regularisation" techniques, in which the emphasis is on suitable preparation of data for subsequent processing. <p> Theoretical predictions are in quantitative agreement with numerical computations carried out on a digital rendering of the density sequence, cf. Fig. 3. Two numerical schemes have been used, a 0-th and a 1-st order one, the details of which are given elsewhere <ref> [5] </ref>. Errors turn out to be largest in the immediate neighbourhood of the singularity. It is clear that in realistic sequences with complex topological structure there will be many such problematic neighbourhoods. If one retains faith in conservation, there are two legitimate explanations for model failure. <p> The motion algorithm derived from the theory is the 1-st order scheme detailed elsewhere <ref> [5] </ref>, in which filter scales are selected so as to (pixelwise) minimize the Frobenius norm of the resulting linear system. It is run on benchmark sequences known as the translating and the diverging tree sequence ("TTS", respectively "DTS"): Fig. 5.

Reference-contexts: It basically boils down to linear filtering with smooth, essentially compact filters, though one should always keep in mind that it is not output in itself ("black box") but in connection to its production ("glass box") that is of interest. Originally proposed by Schwartz <ref> [10] </ref> as a mathematical formalism it may serve as a generic framework for many linear image processing filters used today. Topological duality subjected to a few plausible constraints produces the familiar Gaussian scale-space paradigm (viz. postulate a unique, positive filter consistent with Schwartz' theory and require algebraic closure [4]).
