Abstract: Assume a scenario where a person has called a travel agent and asked for a seat on a popular ight, hence the person knows the chances of getting on that ight are slim. The travel agent says, I am not finding anything then. Assume the parser provides the information that the sentence is declarative, therefore the feature declarative is essential. Indicative and finite-clause become essential since they are predecessors to declarative. Next, the expectations from the pragmatic stratum, unsuccessful-so-far and agent-oriented, are instantiated. These features cause unmarked-neg, active, and speaker-subject to be true and includes them in the composite. Their predecessors (interactant-subject and negative) are also added to the composite. The realization rules are posted to check for inconsistencies, but none occur. The AND joins are evaluated, which adds reduced-negfinite and neg-ind-finite to the composite. At this point, nothing more can be determined with the available knowledge. A decision must be made as to whether the sentence is marked or unmarked-declarative-theme. Since the unmarked-declarative-theme is the default feature, it is included in the composite. The composite is checked for inconsistencies, and none exist. Efficiency: By using systemic grammar as the knowledge representation, we have a hierarchy of hypotheses. Ruling out one hypothesis rules out all of that hypothesis descendants. Further efficiency is attained by mapping contextual information directly to features in the systemic grammar, hence reducing the number of hypotheses needing to be considered.
