Abstract: In spite of the dramatic improvements in the cost of secondary storage, magnetic disks alone are inadequate for meeting the storage and delivery needs of many modern applications. Novel designs of storage hierarchies are needed if we wish to take advantage of the low cost of tape media but still provide reasonable performance characteristics, in the context of modern applications. Specifically, we are interested in multimedia storage server applications, which in addition to high storage and high bandwidth requirements must support display of continuous data streams (e.g., video) and thus satisfy real time constraints. In this paper we focus on the issues and tradeoffs involved in the design of multimedia tertiary storage systems that store and retrieve heterogeneous multimedia objects.

The time required for all these operations to complete is termed cycle time (C t ).

Reference-contexts: In a later work [4] the authors showed that, depending on the system workload, tape striping can be a viable and attractive alternative. Some of the issues encountered in multi-level multimedia server design were addressed in <ref> [3] </ref>. Given the current tape drive technology, a single drive can simultaneously support multiple continuous streams of data, and thus it is important to devise schemes to efficiently share the bandwidth among many streams while satisfying the real-time constrains.

Reference-contexts: Given the architectural differences of various tertiary storage systems, flexibility in the order of block and tape retrieval will provide opportunities for scheduling optimization within a round (or customization of scheduling to different architectures, e.g., as in <ref> [5] </ref>). However, it also exhibits the following disadvantages: * Potentially higher average latency under a small class of workloads.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In spite of the dramatic improvements in the cost of secondary storage, magnetic disks alone are inadequate for meeting the storage and delivery needs of many modern applications <ref> [6] </ref>. Tape media is still two orders of magnitude less expensive than magnetic disk storage; although, tape drives exhibit access latencies two to four orders of magnitude larger than that of disk drives.

Reference-contexts: The idea of servicing multiple streams from one tape system by buffering data on secondary storage was exploited in <ref> [7] </ref>, where the notion of a cycle was introduced in the context of tertiary storage.
