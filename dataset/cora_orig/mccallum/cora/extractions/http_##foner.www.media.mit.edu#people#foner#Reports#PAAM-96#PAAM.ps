Abstract: from one agent to another in the same fashion that word-of-mouth is used when people are looking for an expert. A prototype of the system has been implemented, and results of its use are presented.

Reference-contexts: Their system certainly is a matchmaker, but it assumes a centralized matchmaker and a highly-structured representation of user interests. Others have taken a more distributed approach. For example, Kautz, Milewski, and Selman <ref> [6] </ref> report work on a prototype system for expertise location in a large company.

Reference-contexts: A common technique in systems that support computation amongst a group of users is to centralize a server and have its users act like clients. Systems that match user interests to each other, and have such a centralized structure, include We bhound [14] and HOMR/Ringo [9]. Kuokka and Harada <ref> [8] </ref> describe a system that matches advertisements and requests from users and hence serves as a bro-kering service. Their system certainly is a matchmaker, but it assumes a centralized matchmaker and a highly-structured representation of user interests. Others have taken a more distributed approach.

Reference-contexts: Dot products which have high scores are reported. In Yentas case, the query is itself a document; therefore, Yenta essentially takes pairs of documents, dots them together, and assumes that high scores indicate similarity. This is not the only way to do this, of course. For example, consider WordNet <ref> [13] </ref>, which is a semantic net that allows comparing words based on how many links away one word is from another, and in what direction (e.g., synonym, antonym, superset, etc).

Reference-contexts: Future work may explore the stability of the clustering algorithm in the face of nonreflexive comparison operators. Since Yenta-Lites grains are all exclusively textual, we use the SMART <ref> [15] </ref> document system to compare them. SMART is designed primarily to index and retrieve documents from large collections.
