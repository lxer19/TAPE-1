Abstract: The time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations of superconduc-tivity define a dynamical process when the applied magnetic field varies with time. Sufficient conditions (in terms of the time rate of change of the applied field) are given that, if satisfied, guarantee that this dynamical process is asymptotically autonomous. As time goes to infinity, the dynamical process asymptotically approaches a dynamical system whose attractor coincides with the omega-limit set of the dynamical process.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This article is concerned with the time evolution of the superconducting and electromagnetic properties of a superconductor in a time-dependent magnetic field, as described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equations of superconductivity. The dynamics of the TDGL equations were the focus of investigation in our earlier article <ref> [1] </ref>, where we showed that the equations define a dynamical process in a suitably chosen Hilbert space. Here, we study the particular case of an asymptotically autonomous dynamical process, which arises when the time rate of change of the applied magnetic field decays sufficiently fast as time goes to infinity. <p> In this gauge, A and OE satisfy the identities OE + !(r A) = 0 on fi (0; 1); !(n A) = 0 on @ fi (0; 1): (1.8) If the triple ( ; A; OE) satisfies the TDGL equations, then the second identity can be strengthened, and we have <ref> [1] </ref> OE + !(r A) = 0 on fi (0; 1); n A = 0 on @ fi (0; 1): (1.9) The gauge choice fixes OE, such that R OE dx = 0 at all times. <p> If ! = 0, we restrict the minimization to the closed linear subspace D 0 (J 0 ) = fA 2 D (J 0 ) : r A = 0 in g of D (J 0 ), where J 0 has a unique minimizer A H ; see <ref> [1, Lemma 3] </ref>. In either case, A H is the unique solution of the boundary-value problem r fi r fi A H = r fi H and r A H = 0 in ; (2.2) Thus, A H takes care of the inhomogeneity in the boundary conditions (1.12). <p> The mapping H 7! A H , which is linear and time independent, is continuous from [W ;2 ()] n to [W 1+;2 ()] n for 0 1; see <ref> [1, Lemma 4] </ref>. <p> The proofs of the theorems are given in Section 4. We begin by recalling some relevant results from our earlier article <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> such that 0 &lt; ! &lt; 1, 1 2 &lt; ff &lt; 1, and 2 (1 ff); and The initial-value problem (2.13) has a unique mild solution u 2 C (0; T ; W 1+ff;2 ) for any u 0 2 D (A (1+ff)=2 ) and any T &gt; 0 <ref> [1, Theorem 1] </ref>. <p> Equations (3.5)-(3.7) define a dynamical system <ref> [1] </ref>. Before we can introduce this dynamical system, we must homogenize the boundary conditions (3.7). <p> The solutions of the abstract initial-value prob lem (3.11) generate a dynamical system S = fS (t) : t 0g on D (A (1+ff)=2 ) by the definition v (t) = S (t)v 0 ; t 0; (3.15) see <ref> [1, Corollary 2] </ref>. The system S completely describes the dynamics of the TDGL equations (3.5)-(3.7). <p> ) " B R satisfying the inequality ku s v s k W 1+ff;2 ffi, we have kU (s + t; s)u s S (t)v s k W 1+ff;2 "; (3.19) for all s; t 2 R with t 0 s &lt; 1 and 0 t T . 11 Following <ref> [1] </ref>, we introduce the energy-type functional E !;H (t) [ ; A] = fi fi i r + A fi fi + 2 1 j j 2 + 2!(r A) 2 i Z fl fi fi fi fi 2 and its analog with H (t) replaced by H 1 . <p> Since H is time dependent, E !;H (t) is not a Liapunov functional for U . However, a slight modification of E !;H (t) gets us closer to a Liapunov functional. Indeed, from <ref> [1, Lemma 1] </ref> we have the inequality E !;H (t) P (t) E !;H (s) P (s) for 0 s t &lt; 1; (3.21) where the function P , defined by the expression P (t) = 0 2 1=2 is bounded for all times, because of the hypothesis (H4"). <p> An attractor is called a global attractor if it attracts all its open bounded neighborhoods. Notice that, for the dynamical system S, !(B; S) = t 0 0 tt 0 The existence of a global attractor A S for S follows from <ref> [1, Corollary 2 and Theorem 3] </ref>; see [8, Theorem 3.4.8] and [9, Theorem 4.4]. The existence of a global attractor A U for U follows from [1, Corollary 2] and Theorem 2 of the present article; see [8, Theorem 3.7.2] and [9, Theorem 4.4]. <p> The existence of a global attractor A U for U follows from <ref> [1, Corollary 2] </ref> and Theorem 2 of the present article; see [8, Theorem 3.7.2] and [9, Theorem 4.4]. Our final theorem shows that the dynamical process U and the dynamical system S have the same global attractor. <p> Note that the mapping h 7! A h 14 is linear, time independent, and continuous from [W ;2 ()] n to [W 1+;2 ()] n for 0 1; see <ref> [1, Lemma 4] </ref>. <p> choose simultaneously ffi &gt; 0 sufficiently small and t 0 0 sufficiently large that ffi + sup kh (t 0 )k W ff;2 + t 0 L 2 dt 0 C Hypotheses (H4') and (H4") guarantee that such a choice is possible. 4.2 Proof of Theorem 2 Proof. (i) See <ref> [1, Theorem 3 (i)] </ref>. (ii) See [1, Lemma 1]. (iii) See [1, Theorem 3 (ii)] for S. It remains to prove (iii) for U . The functional E !;H (t) [ ; A] defined in Eq. (3.20) is coercive on W 1;2 ; see [5, Chapter I, Eq. (5.45)]. <p> small and t 0 0 sufficiently large that ffi + sup kh (t 0 )k W ff;2 + t 0 L 2 dt 0 C Hypotheses (H4') and (H4") guarantee that such a choice is possible. 4.2 Proof of Theorem 2 Proof. (i) See [1, Theorem 3 (i)]. (ii) See <ref> [1, Lemma 1] </ref>. (iii) See [1, Theorem 3 (ii)] for S. It remains to prove (iii) for U . The functional E !;H (t) [ ; A] defined in Eq. (3.20) is coercive on W 1;2 ; see [5, Chapter I, Eq. (5.45)]. <p> sufficiently large that ffi + sup kh (t 0 )k W ff;2 + t 0 L 2 dt 0 C Hypotheses (H4') and (H4") guarantee that such a choice is possible. 4.2 Proof of Theorem 2 Proof. (i) See [1, Theorem 3 (i)]. (ii) See [1, Lemma 1]. (iii) See <ref> [1, Theorem 3 (ii)] </ref> for S. It remains to prove (iii) for U . The functional E !;H (t) [ ; A] defined in Eq. (3.20) is coercive on W 1;2 ; see [5, Chapter I, Eq. (5.45)]. <p> We improve this regularity result by taking advantage of the smoothing action of the semigroup e At ; see the proof of global existence in <ref> [1, Theorem 1] </ref>. 18 We first treat A 0 and then use the result to improve the regularity of . Each term in F , which has been defined in Eq. (2.9), needs to be estimated separately. <p> The smoothing action of e At applied to the term @ t A H yields the integral J H (t) = 0 Making use of hypothesis (H4"), one shows that J H : [0; 1) 7! [W 1+ff;2 ()] n is a bounded continuous function; see <ref> [1, Lemma 5] </ref>. The remaining terms in F are estimated in a standard way. For example, k fl r k L 2 k k L 1 k k W 1;2 Ckuk W 1;2 : Here, C = maxf1; k 0 k L 1 g, which is independent of . <p> The compactness of the orbit closure is an immediate consequence of the boundedness and <ref> [1, Corollary 2] </ref>. (iv) See [1, Theorem 3 (iii)] for S. It remains to prove (iv) for U . Let s 0 be fixed. <p> The compactness of the orbit closure is an immediate consequence of the boundedness and [1, Corollary 2]. (iv) See <ref> [1, Theorem 3 (iii)] </ref> for S. It remains to prove (iv) for U . Let s 0 be fixed. <p> If w = ( ; A A H ) 2 ! s (u 0 ), then E ! [S (t)w] = E ! [w] for all t &gt; 0, and the same argument as in <ref> [1, proof of Theorem 3 (iii)] </ref> leads to the conclusion that !(r A) = 0 in . Because ! &gt; 0, it follows that r A = 0. 4.3 Proof of Theorem 3 Proof. <p> Let B U = 0st&lt;1 U (t; s)B. The coercivity on W 1;2 of the functional E !;H (t) [ ; A] defined in Eq. (3.20) and the inequality (3.21) imply that B U is bounded in W 1+ff;2 . Furthermore, <ref> [1, Corollary 2] </ref> implies that, for 0 s &lt; t &lt; 1, each U (t; s) : D (A (1+ff)=2 ) ! D (A (1+ff)=2 ) maps bounded sets into relatively compact sets.
