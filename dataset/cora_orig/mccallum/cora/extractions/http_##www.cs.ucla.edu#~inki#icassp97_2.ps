Abstract: Although the undeniable importance of high quality, efficient and effective DSP synthesis benchmark has been firmly and widely established, until now the emphasis of benchmarking has been restricted on assembling individual examples. In this paper we introduce the "ideal candidate benchmark methodology" which poses the development of the benchmark as well as defines a statistical and optimization problem. We first outline the goals and requirements relevant for the benchmark development. After discussing the computational complexity of the benchmark selection problem, we present a simulated annealing-based algorithm for solving this computationally intractable optimization task. Using this approach from 150 examples we select 12 examples for the new DSP Quant benchmark for DSP hard Real-Time applications. The DSP benchmark is statistically validated, and its application to the analysis and development of system-level synthesis algorithms is demonstrated.

Reference-contexts: VALIDATION AND APPLICATIONS We validated the proposed approach and the simulated annealing algorithm for the ideal candidates benchmark using both a statistical method and a direct application in system level synthesis. The validation of the DSP Quant benchmark has been conducted using a statistical validation technique, resubsti-tutions <ref> [3] </ref>. A number of randomly chosen design examples are eliminated from the pool of design examples from which the original benchmark set is selected. A new benchmark set is selected.

Reference-contexts: We now define the ICB problem using more formal Garey-Johnson format <ref> [4] </ref>. ICB Problem: Instance: A sufficiently large set of N examples is given and each example x j is numerically characterized by the set of m relevant properties, x jl , l = 1; :::; m and a constant M . <p> Dist (y i ; x j ) can be any distance measure, for example, geometric p P m l=1 (y il x jl ) 2 , or Manhattan P m We proved that the ICB problem is NP-complete by using polynomial "local replacement" <ref> [4] </ref> transformation from a special instance of the MIN-MAX MULTICENTER problem where the selected points are from the set of the available points. 5.

Reference-contexts: A new benchmark set is selected. By comparing the new benchmark set with the original one by the "weighted bipartite matching" technique, we can measure the validity of the original and the new ones. We use the Hungarian Method <ref> [5] </ref> to solve the problem. Even more important than the statistical validation is the experimental demonstration of the effectiveness of the the DSP Quant benchmark. We recently developed a scheduling and assignment program for power minimization on programmable heterogeneous platforms. The program uses a set of 9 parameters.

Reference-contexts: The number of iterations of the inner loop is set to 30. Lastly, the frozen criterion is given by the temperature. If the temperature falls below 0.1, the simulated annealing algorithm stops. The relevant properties we used are the following (for detailed definition of properties see <ref> [6] </ref>); (i) Number of Operations (ii) Iteration Bound (iii) Variance of the number of operations for a given task (iv) Average Parallelism (v) Maximal Parallelism (vi) Percentage of Operations which can be pipelined; (vii) Average Temporal Locality (viii) Maximal Temporal Locality. 1.

The actual implementation details of the simulated annealing algorithm are presented for each of the following areas; the cost function, the neighbor solution generation, the temperature update function, the equilibrium criterion and the frozen criterion.

Reference-contexts: 1. MOTIVATION Benchmarking is a widely recognized and extensively used approach to performance evaluation. Since the early beginning of computer science and engineering, benchmark-ing has been playing a wide variety of important roles, greatly influencing major hardware and software concepts. A number DSP benchmarks are presented in <ref> [8] </ref> [9], but their quality and performances have never been reported. Recently, benchmarking attracted an exceptionally high attention in both research and industrial CAD communities. Popular benchmarks are available for sequential test generation, logic synthesis, physical design, and circuit simulation [1] [2].
