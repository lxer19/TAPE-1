Abstract: Automated intelligent agents inhabiting a shared environment must coordinate their activities. Cooperation not merely coordination may improve the performance of the individual agents or the overall behavior of the system they form. Research in Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) addresses the problem of designing automated intelligent systems which interact effectively. DAI is not the only field to take on the challenge of understanding cooperation and coordination. There are a variety of other multi-entity environments in which the entities coordinate their activity and cooperate. Among them are groups of people, animals, particles, and computers. We argue that in order to address the challenge of building coordinated and collaborated intelligent agents, it is beneficial to combine AI techniques with methods and techniques from a range of multi-entity fields, such as game theory, operations research, physics and philosophy. To support this claim, we describe some of our projects, where we have successfully taken an interdisciplinary approach. We demonstrate the benefits in applying multi-entity methodologies and show the adaptations, modifications and extensions necessary for solving the DAI problems.

In such situations, the agents are self-motivated, and usually the automated agents need to interact with people. The number of agents in the environment is not large, and communication is possible.

Reference-contexts: Game-theoretic coalition formation theories can be used in the development of automated agents that represent these drivers as they form coalitions.

Reference-contexts: The second approach, which we refer to as the negotiation guides approach, comprises informal theories which attempt to identify possible strategies for a negotiator and to assist him in achieving good results (see, for example, <ref> [19, 13, 35, 33, 29] </ref>). These negotiation guides do not accept the strong restrictions and assumptions presented in the game-theoretic models. Applying these methods to DAI is more difficult than using the first approach, since there is no formal theory nor strategies that can be used.

Reference-contexts: belonging to different airlines need to share the limited resources of the same airport, and it is necessary to find a mechanism that will give priority to planes with less fuel on board [61]; an electronic market populated with automated agents which represent different enterprises and buy and sell (e.g., <ref> [8, 17, 74] </ref>); transportation centers that deliver packages and may cooperate to reduce expenses [64]; information servers that form coalitions for answering queries [36]; and intelligent agents that negotiate over meeting scheduling options on behalf of people for whom they work [67]. <p> Since it is assumed in game theory that the players are self-motivated, so should the agents be in the environments where these techniques are applied. DAI addresses both situations in which each individual agent acts by itself (e.g., <ref> [61, 67, 17] </ref>), thus calling for the application of noncooperative models, and situations in which tasks require that groups of agents work together (e.g., [64, 36]), thus calling for cooperative models.

In such situations, all the agents work together toward the satisfaction of a joint goal; the designer of the automated agents can develop, in advance, protocols for cooperation between the agents; the number of agents is not large; and the agents can communicate and have computation capabilities.

Applying these methods to DAI is more difficult than using the first approach, since there is no formal theory nor strategies that can be used. <p> For example, as we mentioned above, Diplomat consists of different modules for planning - i.e., the Ministry of Defense and negotiations - i.e., the Foreign Office. The development of different modules for negotiation and planning is a characteristic of a good negotiator, according to Fisher and Ury's model <ref> [19] </ref>. They suggest that a good negotiator should do much "inventing," that is, find out new ideas that are not already among the negotiation issues. <p> Coalitions and agreements among the players significantly affect the course of the game. 12 that the agreement is profitable to Diplomat (see <ref> [19] </ref>); otherwise he will suspect that the negotiator will later break the agreement. In order to test Diplomat, we arranged several Diplomacy games, and our findings (see [41]) show that Diplomat played well in the games in which it participated.

Reference-contexts: In such situations, we found that formalizing and implementing informal models of behavioral and social sciences can be beneficial. Behavioral and social sciences study human cooperation and coordination and develop frameworks and models of organizations and communities (e.g., <ref> [60, 20, 59, 46] </ref>). In non-structured and unpredictable environments, heuristics for cooperation and coordination among automated agents, based on successful human cooperation and interaction techniques, may be useful. We have applied informal models to different types of environments, and we will discuss one of them below.

Reference-contexts: The game-theoretic strategic approach to the bargaining problem 2 provides a useful foundation for designing such capabilities in systems. In this approach, agents' negotiating maneuvers are moves in a noncooperative game, and the rationality assumption of the negotiators <ref> [30] </ref> is expressed by using the Nash Equilibrium concept 3 . Our main goal in this research was to define an acceptable protocol for the interactions among the agents and to identify strategies for the agents participating in the negotiation. These methods are applicable in the following example.

Reference-contexts: will give priority to planes with less fuel on board [61]; an electronic market populated with automated agents which represent different enterprises and buy and sell (e.g., [8, 17, 74]); transportation centers that deliver packages and may cooperate to reduce expenses [64]; information servers that form coalitions for answering queries <ref> [36] </ref>; and intelligent agents that negotiate over meeting scheduling options on behalf of people for whom they work [67]. Using the five criteria presented in the introduction to characterize these examples, we observe that in these examples the agents are self-motivated and try to maximize their own benefits. <p> DAI addresses both situations in which each individual agent acts by itself (e.g., [61, 67, 17]), thus calling for the application of noncooperative models, and situations in which tasks require that groups of agents work together (e.g., <ref> [64, 36] </ref>), thus calling for cooperative models. In the first case, game-theoretic models are appropriate when there is only a handful of agents, and, in the second case, game theory may be applied to a few dozens of agents.

Reference-contexts: For example, the World Wide Web (WWW) consists of millions of users and is still growing. Another example is the employment of hundreds of simple, inexpensive autonomous mobile devices to achieve military and civilian goals in ground, air, and underwater environments [22]. In such situations <ref> [31, 73] </ref>, the agents work together toward satisfying a large set of joint goals, and the designers of the agents can agree in advance on regulations and protocols for the agents' interaction.

Reference-contexts: We have applied the classical mechanics-based methods to the following freight transportation example <ref> [16, 75, 63] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We recommend, in such situations, the consideration of operations research techniques. Researchers in operations research seek to determine how best to design and operate an organizational system, usually under conditions of scarce resources <ref> [76] </ref>. Autonomous agents working in DPS environments can be considered as an organizational system, and thus algorithms that were developed for human organizations in operations research may be applied to DAI environments.
