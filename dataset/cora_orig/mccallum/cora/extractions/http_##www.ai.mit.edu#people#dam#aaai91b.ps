Title: Natural Language Based Inference Procedures applied to Schubert's Steamroller  
Author: Robert Givan David McAllester Sameer Shalaby 
Keyword: Schubert's steamroller in a single step.  
Abstract: We have previously argued that the syntactic structure of natural language can be exploited to construct powerful polynomial time inference procedures. This paper supports the earlier arguments by demonstrating that a natural language based polynomial time procedure can solve This report describes research done at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Reference-contexts: The rules of obviousness of our Socratic system include all of the inference rules in figure 1 plus the following two rules concerning -expressions: (33) (y); (focus-on y) (every y ( x (x))) 3 The term "Socratic proof" was introduced in <ref> [ Crawford and Kuipers, 1989 ] </ref> to describe any system in which steps of a proof are verified using an automated reasoning procedure.

Reference-contexts: A "taxonomic syntax" for first order logic is presented in [ McAllester et al., 1989 ] . A more elaborate "Montagovian syntax" for first order logic, incorporating quantificational aspects of English noun phrases, is presented in <ref> [ McAllester and Givan, 1989 ] </ref> . The polynomial time inference procedure used here to solve Schu-bert's steamroller is defined by a set of inference rules stated in a Montagovian syntax. <p> The inference relation defined by these inference rules appears not to be definable in the classical syntax of first order logic. 2 Montagovian Syntax In this section we present a Montagovian syntax for first order logic similar to that described in <ref> [ McAllester and Givan, 1989 ] </ref> . The classical syntax for first order logic involves two grammatical categories | formulas and terms. The Montago-vian syntax presented below also involves two syntactic categories | formulas and class expressions. Formulas denote truth values and class expressions denote sets. <p> The "quantifiers" some and every that appear in noun phrases are considered to be quantifier-free combinators. In <ref> [ McAllester and Givan, 1989 ] </ref> we show that satisfiability is decidable (NP-complete) for the quantifier-free fragment of the Montagovian syntax presented in that paper. Although the Mon-tagovian syntax presented here is somewhat more elaborate, we conjecture that the quantifier-free fragment remains decidable.

Reference-contexts: There exist useful, though incomplete, tractable sets of inference rules for first order logic. However, much more powerful tractable rule sets can be given if first order formulas are written in a non-standard syntax. A "taxonomic syntax" for first order logic is presented in <ref> [ McAllester et al., 1989 ] </ref> . A more elaborate "Montagovian syntax" for first order logic, incorporating quantificational aspects of English noun phrases, is presented in [ McAllester and Givan, 1989 ] .

Reference-contexts: We have a polynomial time implementation of the inference relation ` M 0 , provided there is a bounded level of -nesting. This implementation is constructed along the lines described in <ref> [ McAllester, 1989 ] </ref> . We conjecture that M 0 is local, and thus that ` M 0 is the same as ` M 0 .

Reference-contexts: This (incomplete) first order inference relation appears not have any definition in the classical syntax for first order logic. 2 We have constructed a polynomial time inference procedure based on this set of inference rules. A general theoretical framework for constructing polynomial time inference procedures is presented in <ref> [ McAllester, 1990 ] </ref> . Let R be any set of inference rules. The following definition is from [ McAllester, 1990 ] . <p> A general theoretical framework for constructing polynomial time inference procedures is presented in <ref> [ McAllester, 1990 ] </ref> . Let R be any set of inference rules. The following definition is from [ McAllester, 1990 ] . <p> The following lemma is proved in <ref> [ McAllester, 1990 ] </ref> . Lemma: For any given rule set R, there exists a procedure for determining whether or not ` R which runs in time polynomial in the written length of and . The inference relation ` R is a restricted version of ` R . <p> However, there is a large class of rule sets for which these two relations are the same. The following definition is also from <ref> [ McAllester, 1990 ] </ref> . Definition: A set R of inference rules is called local if the relation ` R is the same as the relation ` R . <p> An immediate consequence of the above definitions and lemma is that local rule sets are tractable, i.e., they generate polynomial time decidable inference relations. A variety of nontrivial local rule sets is presented in <ref> [ McAllester, 1990 ] </ref> . Let M be the set of inference rules in figure 1 together with the contrapositives of those rules. We conjecture, although we have not yet proved, that M is local.

Reference-contexts: If policeman is a class symbol that denotes the set of all policemen, then the formula (every policeman (owns (some car))) is true if every policeman owns a car. 2 Our formal semantics for the Montagovian syntax is a (drastic) simplification of Montague's original semantics for English <ref> [ Montague, 1973 ] </ref> . 1 Just as in classical syntax, a model of our Montagovian language is a first order model, i.e., a domain D together with an interpretation of constant, class, and relation symbols. Each first order model interprets each constant symbol as an element of its domain.
