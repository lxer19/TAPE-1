Abstract: Amongst the myriad of time-frequency distributions, the Wigner distribution stands alone in satisfying many desirable mathematical properties. Attempts to extend definitions of the Wigner distribution to discrete signals have not been completely successful. In this letter, we propose an alternative definition for the Wigner distribution that extends to discrete signals in a straightforward manner. Under this definition, we show that the Wigner distribution does not exist for certain classes of discrete signals.

Reference-contexts: McLaughlin et al. [11] and Narayanan et al. [12] attempted to apply operator theory to create a type IV Wigner distribution, but they were unable to extend the theory to type IV signals. Our definition is based on the following result from <ref> [4] </ref>. Theorem. The Wigner distribution is the only time-frequency distribution for type I signals that: (i) is a quadratic function of the signal, (ii) is covariant to time shifts and frequency shifts, (iii) satisfies Moyal's formula, (iv) is compatible with modulations, (v) is compatible with filtering, and (vi) is real. <p> Proof. Properties (i) and (ii) limit us to TFDs in Cohen's class <ref> [4, 5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: III Type II Wigner Distribution We will use the above theorem in an attempt to define a type II Wigner distribution. Properties (i) and (ii) restrict us to type II TFDs of the following form (this is called the type II Cohen's class in <ref> [8] </ref>): x (n; !) = m p x (p; m) (n p; m) e j!m = 0 m x (; m) (; m) e j!m e jn d where R II x , A II x , and are defined analogous to the above. <p> As a result, the type II Wigner distribution does not exist under this definition. There are type II distributions that satisfy all but one of the above properties. For example, the type II Page and the type II Rihaczek distributions, defined in <ref> [8] </ref>, satisfy all of the properties except for (v) and (vi), respectively. IV Type IV Wigner Distribution We will also use the above theorem in an attempt to define a type IV Wigner distribution. <p> IV Type IV Wigner Distribution We will also use the above theorem in an attempt to define a type IV Wigner distribution. Properties (i) and (ii) restrict us to type IV TFDs of the following form (this is called the type IV Cohen's class in <ref> [8] </ref>): C IV N1 X R IV N1 X A IV where R IV x , A IV x , and are defined analogous to the above, and all functions are periodic.
