Abstract: In this paper we present the design, implementation and evaluation of mobiware a mobile middleware toolkit that enables adaptive mobile services to dynamically exploit the intrinsic scalable properties of mobile multimedia applications in response to time-varying mobile network conditions. The mobiware toolkit is software-intensive (comet.columbia.edu/mobiware) and is built on CORBA and Java distributed object technology. Based on an open programmable paradigm developed by the COMET Group, mobiware runs on mobile devices, wireless access points and mobile-capable switch/routers providing a set of open programmable interfaces and objects for adaptive mobile networking. These programmable interfaces and objects include: (i) a QOS adaptive API, which allows an application to specify its bandwidth utility function, adaptation policy and session preferences; (ii) QOS controlled handoff, which reduces the handoff dropping probability by using adaptation and media scaling techniques at the mobile device, access point and in the access network; (ii) mobile soft-state, which provides mobile devices with the capability to respond to changes in time-varying quality of service; (iii) flow bundling, which exploits a common routing representation for all flows to and from a mobile device to speed up handoff; and finally (iv) active filtering, which dynamically loads media filters into access points to intelligently scale application level sessions (e.g., flows) to match time-varying wireless capacity.

Reference-contexts: To address these challenges, we have built an open [Lazar,97] and active [Tennenhouse,97] programmable mobile network [Campbell,96] <ref> [Angin,98a] </ref> that is controlled by a software middleware toolkit called mobiware [Mobiware,98]. Mobiware extends earlier work by the COMET group on the programmable broadband networks [xbind,96] to the mobile and wireless domain.

Reference-contexts: By scaling flows during periods of resource contention (e.g., during handoff), mobiware improves the wireless resource utilization and helps reduce the handoff dropping probability. While the style of handoff is entirely programmable <ref> [Angin,98b] </ref>, the current implementation style is mobile-initiated, forward handoff with soft-handoff on the downlink and hard-handoff on the uplink. By mobile-initiated, we mean that after a suitable dwell time a mobile device initiates a handoff by first registering with the forward/new access point. <p> For full details of the programming interfaces and results from the different styles of programmable handoff see <ref> [Angin,98b] </ref>. 6 In addition to monitoring delay, loss and bandwidth characteristics of flows a mobile device object receives beacons that inform it of the state of the wireless link.

Seventh Intl. Workshop on Network and Operating System Support for Digital Audio and Video (NOSSDAV), </booktitle> <address> St Louis, </address> <month> May, </month> <year> 1997. </year>
Reference-contexts: Active transport objects can be dynamically dispatched to mobile devices and access points to support valued-added QOS. Currently, two styles of active transport objects have been implemented: active filters <ref> [Balachandran,97] </ref>, which perform temporal and spatial scaling for multi-resolution video and audio flows and adaptive FEC filters [Mobiware,98] which protect content against physical radio link impairments by matching the level of Reed Solomon channel coding to match time-varying error characteristics. <p> The new access point interacts with the active wireless transport to provide active media filters based on the available bandwidth at the air interface <ref> [Balachandran,97] </ref>. To keep the name space binding between the mobile device and access points constant with mobility we have implemented the notion of virtual wireless ports. As mobile devices connect to different access points their VPI/VCIs mapping remain constant. <p> Once a dispatch acknowledgement message has been received from the current access points filter control object the bootstrap process (3) is initiated by filter control. After bootstrap is complete filter control configures the active filter by forwarding an application specific filterspec <ref> [Balachandran,97] </ref> to the active filter control.

Reference-contexts: The utility function allows utility-fair bandwidth allocation algorithms to derive explicit optimization rules under heterogeneous application adaptation behavior. Here bandwidth is allocated fairly to all the flows so that the same utility value is achieved at an access point. For full details of the utility-fair bandwidth allocation algorithm see <ref> [Bianchi,98a] </ref>. The utility function alone, however, is not capable of capturing application specific adaptation dynamics. Rather, a simple set of adaptation policies is used to capture how an application wishes to respond to instantaneous bandwidth availability. <p> Static transport objects include segmentation and reassemble, rate control, flow control, playout control, resource control and buffer management objects. These objects are loaded into the mobile device 1 A generalization of this approach is detailed in <ref> [Bianchi,98a] </ref>. Adaptive mobile applications supply adaptation handlers, which implement applicationspecific adaptation policies supporting more sophisticated levels of adaptation than the current menu options (e.g., fast, handoff) offered in the existing system. Adaptation handlers can program simple or sophisticated adaptation strategies. <p> At 140 sec into the scenario, mobile device M3 sets up a new flow to access web services downloading a GIF file at a rate of 70 Kbps scaling up to 135 Kbps. In related work <ref> [Bianchi,98a] </ref> we are investigating a generalized adaptation policy mechanism where applications can specify application specific adaptation semantics. For example, some applications would not wish to experience the adaptation observed by M1 while others may be as aggressive as M3 in exploiting any available resources. <p> A smaller duration allows mobile devices to aggressively grab resources on a fast time scale. However, this increases the signaling load overhead. Currently, we are investigating the coupling of the probing and adaptation time scales to the application level adaptation policy <ref> [Bianchi,98a] </ref>. 0 400 800 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Average Latency in millisec Number of flows Flow Buldling Performance Handoff Latency of optimized system with flow bundles Handoff Latency of optimized system without flow bundles Handoff Latency of baseline system with flow bundles Handoff Latency

Reference-contexts: The focus of this paper is the design and evaluation of the programmable mobile network layer described in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. At the data link layer, a programmable MAC <ref> [Bianchi,98b] </ref> combines a set of foundation services to support more sophisticated adaptive wireless-QOS services. Foundation services provide sustained rate services used to support minimum wireless-QOS assurances, and active and passive adaptive services to support application specific adaptation policy as discussed in Section 2.1. <p> This programmable MAC service support relies on a simple core architecture that pushes complexity and application specific adaptation decision making to the mobile device. For full details on the programmable MAC see <ref> [Bianchi,98b] </ref>. 2.3 The Network Model Mobiware provides a middleware toolkit that controls mobinet an experimental programmable broadband cellular access network. The network model 2 comprises a set of mobile devices, wireless access points and mobile-capable switches/routers providing broadband cellular and ad hoc communication services to mobile users.

Reference-contexts: Both video flows are based on discretely-adaptive utility functions, i.e., multi-resolution flows. Initially, M1 receive a base layer (BL) at 80 Kbps and M2 a base and enhancement layer (E1) at 150 Kbps. Currently, the adaptive-QOS service gives priority to support the minimum bandwidth requirements of multi-resolution flows <ref> [Campbell,95] </ref>. During the scenario, M2 registers an increase in bit error rate as it moves away from its current access point. Adaptive FEC is applied to the video between the access point and M2 based on the observed SNR and the measured bit error rate.

Reference-contexts: Mobile soft-state provides quality of service adaptation support to cater to a number of these conditions. Mobile soft-state results in the periodic establishment of bandwidth and name space resources for flow bundles between a mobile device and a permobile QAP. Mobiware supports the idea of soft-state <ref> [Clark,90] </ref> in the mobinet to refresh the network state. The periodic refresh messages sent by a mobile device as part of the soft-state probing mechanism are sent on a per-flow bundle basis not a per-flow basis.

Reference-contexts: Providing quality of service assurances in broadband cellular networks is difficult. However, providing quality of service assurances without the aid of any fixed infrastructure as in the case of mobile ad hoc networking is more challenging <ref> [Corson,98] </ref>. We believe there is a need to understand the level of quality of service that can be supported at different points of attachment in mobinet, e.g., at the access point or multiple hops away from the access point.

Reference-contexts: As a result, mobile applications can experience unwarranted delays, packet losses or loss of service. We describe the quality index maintained during handoff between access points as mobile-QOS. There is growing consensus that adaptive techniques <ref> [Katz,94] </ref> present a viable approach to countering time varying quality of service impairments found in wireless and mobile networking environments. However, providing systemwide (i.e., endsystem and network) adaptive quality of service support for mobile multimedia communications is complex to realize in practice and not well understood by the community [Mobicom,97].

Switchlets allow multiple virtual network elements to be operational within the same physical nodes. Three ATM switches (ATML 1, 2, and 3 as shown in Figure 3) in our network are switchlets physically co-located at the same physical switch.

The use of flow bundling techniques in mobile networks shows great performance increases as the number of flows increase during handoff. <p> The handoff latency for ten flows is 155 msec when flow bundling was enabled and 420 msec when disabled. This clearly shows the advantage of such aggregation techniques. Mobiwares flow bundling compares favorably to the literature. In <ref> [Mishra,97] </ref> Mishra reported a handoff latency of 125 msec for ten flows using native ATM signaling code. Mobile soft-state also exploits aggregation techniques provided by flow bundling. This allows resource probing to be based on flow bundles rather than per-flow.

In this case filter control interacts with the filter control object at the current access point to dispatch the selected active filter. The transfer of the Java bytecode class is achieved through the interaction of the filter network loader to fetch the program code.
