Abstract: This paper determines an exact relationship between collision-free hash functions and other cryptographic primitives. Namely, it introduces a new concept, the pseudo-permutation, and shows that the existence of collision-free hash functions is equivalent to the existence of claw-free pairs of pseudo-permutations. We also give a simple construction of collision-free hash functions from everywhere-defined claw-free (pseudo-) permutations.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Hash functions with various cryptographic properties have been studied extensively, especially with respect to signing algorithms (see <ref> [2, 3, 4, 10, 12, 14, 15] </ref>). We focus on the most natural of these functions, the collision-free hash functions. <p> These functions were first carefully studied by Damg-ard <ref> [2] </ref> and have found several applications. In particular, they have been used to improve the efficiency of digital signature schemes by hashing messages prior to signing (which reduces the size of the object operated upon the often costly signing algorithm). <p> Impagliazzo, Levin, and Luby [7] and H-astad [6] demonstrate the equivalence of the existence of pseudo-random number generators (see [1, 13]) and the existence of one-way functions. fl Supported by a NSF Graduate Fellowship, NSF grant 92-12184, AFOSR F49620-92-J-0125, and DARPA N00014-92-J-1799 Damg-ard <ref> [2] </ref>, distilling arguments of Goldwasser, Micali, and Rivest [5], shows that the existence of another cryptographic primitive, a claw-free pair of permutations, is sufficient to construct collision-free hash functions. <p> One way to require that the functions have overlapping images is to require that the functions be permutations. This yields the following object, originally defined in [5] and then in this form by <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> If, instead, the pair has few claws, then the images of the two functions must be nearly disjoint (and so, small) so that the functions themselves are cryptographically rich by virtue of their many collapses. 1 In [5] the intractability of factoring is shown to be sufficient. In <ref> [2] </ref>, the construction of [5] is extended and the intractability of the discrete log is also shown to be sufficient. 2 [11] discusses algebraic forms of one way permutations sufficient for claw-free permutations. 3 This is a collection of pseudo-permutations which are hard to invert in the sense of one-way functions. <p> To complete the proof we show that (2 ) 3) and (3 ) 1): (2 ) 3) A collection of claw-free pairs of simple permutations is a collection of claw-free pairs of permutations, so this implication is clear. 7 (3 ) 1) This proof follows <ref> [2] </ref>. Let i ; f 1 be a collection of claw-free pairs of pseudo-permutations. We construct a collection of collision-free hash functions. <p> The hash functions constructed in this manner require P P (k) i=k+1 i evaluations of the underlying claw-free functions to compute (assuming that the one-bit contractors used are those of (3 ) 1) of Theorem 1). As in <ref> [2] </ref>, however, one can construct these hash functions directly to obtain a more efficient construction. <p> In <ref> [2] </ref>, Damg-ard shows that by using claw-free tuples of functions (in the (3 ) 1) construction) one can reduce the number of required claw-free function evaluations by a multiplicative constant factor.
