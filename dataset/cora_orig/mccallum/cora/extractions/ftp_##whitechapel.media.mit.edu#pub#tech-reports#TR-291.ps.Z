Abstract: shers@media.mit.edu and picard@media.mit.edu MIT Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Group Technical Report #291. Also appears in: Proc. of the Internat. Conf. on Pattern Recognition, Jerusalem, Israel, Oct. 1994. ABSTRACT We develop a method for the simultaneous restoration and halftoning of fingerprints using the "M-lattice", a new nonlinear dynamical system. This system is rooted in the reaction-diffusion model, first proposed by Turing to explain morphogenesis (the formation of patterns in nature). But in contrast with the general reaction-diffusion, the state variables of the M-lattice are guaranteed to be bounded. The M-lattice system is closely related to the analog Hop-field network and the cellular neural network, but has more flexibility in how its variables interact. These properties make it better suited than reaction-diffusion for several new engineering applications. The proposed method for enhancing fingerprints explores the ability of the M-lattice to form oriented spatial patterns (like reaction-diffusion), while producing binary outputs (like feedback neural networks). The fingerprints synthesized by the M-lattice retain and emphasize more of the relevant detail than do those obtained by adaptive thresholding, a common halftoning method employed in traditional fingerprint classification systems.

Reference-contexts: Until recently, reaction-diffusion systems have been researched predominantly by mathematical biologists working on theories of natural pattern formation and by chemists working on modeling the dynamics of complex chemical reactions <ref> [1] </ref>, [2]. However, the past several years have seen a significant surge in interest in reaction-diffusion systems, primarily for exploiting them in the areas of computer graphics [3], [4] and image processing [5]. For pattern formation to occur, a reaction-diffusion system must exhibit local instability to small non-homogeneous perturbations. <p> Section 5 summarizes the report. 2. REACTION-DIFFUSION Turing's last paper before his death was a first attempt to provide a scientific explanation for the dappled patterns of pigmentation in animals <ref> [1] </ref>. Many mammals have prominent coat markings. For example, zebras have stripes, giraffes have contoured patches, leopards and cheetahs have spots; the furs of many dogs and cats also display various forms of stripes and patches of different color. <p> Turing has determined the conditions on D A and D I under which the system in (4) is stable to homogeneous (i.e., DC) perturbations and unstable to non-homogeneous (i.e., AC) perturbations at least for one value of k x <ref> [1] </ref>. Tur-ing gave the name "chemical wavelength" to this dominant spatial frequency, characteristic of (1). As the amplitude of the dominant mode grows, the linear analysis ceases to be valid. However, Turing argues that the linear behavior predicts the overall non-linear behavior reasonably well. <p> Any solution trajectory of this diagonal-state clipped M -lattice system converges to a finite asymptotically stable fixed point, ~ 2 &lt; N (or ~ 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref> N ). 1 This is the definition adapted for the present paper. The general M-lattice system is defined in [8]. Thus far, no proof of total stability exists for the more general system, (6). <p> system, (6), can be written as follows: d (~n; t) = a (~n) fl (~n; t) + s (~n) h (~n) fl (~n; t); (7) where ~n 2 Z 2 , a (~n) and h (~n) are the FIR filters, corresponding to A and H, respectively, and s (~n) 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref> is the original finely quantized input image signal. The advantage of using this type of the clipped M -lattice system for the pre-processing of fingerprints is that it can be guaranteed to produce binary outputs [8]. <p> The dominant orientation at a pixel is characterized by the angle, i 2 [; ], and by the relative strength (or magnitude), m i 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, of that angle's presence at pixel i. Each filter is a 2-D Gaussian, whose level sets are oriented ellipses.

For pattern formation to occur, a reaction-diffusion system must exhibit local instability to small non-homogeneous perturbations. <p> The sim plest model uses two morphogens: the "activator" and the "inhibitor". The morphogens themselves are produced by chemical reactions among particular enzymes in every cell of the animal's skin during the animal's embryonic stages <ref> [2] </ref>. According to this model, the two morphogens react with each other; however, the model consisting of reaction alone cannot account for the tremendous variety of coating patterns observed in animals. <p> Also, if the real part of (k x ) is negative, then the spatial harmonics decay to zero. Thus, for explaining the formation of natural patterns, such as zebra stripes and leopard spots, it was the sixth mode (growing spatially-stationary waves) that received a lot of attention <ref> [2] </ref>. The other modes of reaction-diffusion systems have also been used, for instance, in modeling the behavior of oscillating chemical reactions [2]. <p> Thus, for explaining the formation of natural patterns, such as zebra stripes and leopard spots, it was the sixth mode (growing spatially-stationary waves) that received a lot of attention <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The essential steps comprising the identification sequence are: determining the type of the fingerprint, counting of ridges and bifurcations, and locating the core. A binary fingerprint image is more amenable for these tasks than a gray-scale fingerprint image <ref> [12] </ref>. We propose a pre-processing scheme that not only halftones the original fingerprint image, but also removes artifacts that can hinder the identification process. <p> From the figure, it can be seen that the original fingerprint is corrupted by a number of scratches, and several regions are obscured by uneven illumination. As shown in Figure 2 (b), the common fingerprint halftoning method, based on adaptive median filtering and thresholding <ref> [12] </ref>, only makes these artifacts more apparent, because it increases the image's contrast. The adaptive threshold is set to the average of the minimum and the maximum gray levels within some neighborhood surrounding each pixel of the original fingerprint image.
