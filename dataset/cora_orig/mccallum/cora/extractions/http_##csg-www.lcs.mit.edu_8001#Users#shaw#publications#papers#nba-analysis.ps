Abstract: This paper examines the relationships between pay, performance, draft year, and draft position in the NBA. Performance is measured with the Tendex scale. The average performance of players drafted after the first half of the first round is fairly constant, especially when adjusted for minutes played. The primary effect of draft position is of survival rates in the NBA players drafted later have a higher chance of being cut, which may be partially due to more limited minutes. Although there is a correlation between pay and performance, players within a given performance range may have widely differing pay. As a rule of thumb, five Tendex points of performance are worth one million dollars in annual salary.

Reference-contexts: To perform this analysis, we have gathered statistics from a variety of sources on the Internet. From Doug Steele's Doug's NBA Stat Page <ref> [1] </ref>, we retrieved the Tendex = (PTS FGmsd FTmsd/2 + 1.25 fi st + 1.25 fi as + bl Tendex48 = (Tendex fi 48 fi gp) / mp PTS = points scored FGmsd = field goals missed FTmsd = free throws missed st = steals as = assists bl = blocks

Reference-contexts: Tendex48 normalizes Tendex for minutes played. current statistics used to calculate the performance of all active NBA players. From Patricia Bender's Patricia's various basketball stuff page <ref> [2] </ref>, we retrieved salaries for this year (1995-1996). From the NBASTATS tm Project ftp site [3], we gathered the draft orders for the last 20 years. Some other basic information about the NBA was available on the rec.sport.basketball.pro FAQ [4]. <p> Only a few teams actually fit under the cap this year. More details about NBA salaries can be obtained from Patricia Bender's Web site <ref> [2] </ref>. Because the NBA is in the entertainment business, and not in the basketball business, the worth of some players cannot be evaluated solely or even primarily by performance.
