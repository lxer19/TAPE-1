Title: Generation of Optimal Bilinear Multiplication Algorithms: Theory and Implementation  
Author: Mohammad A. Shokrollahi, Kai Werther 
Date: December 14, 1992  
Abstract: Let m(q) denote the maximum number of points of an elliptic curve over F q . Given a prime power q = p f and an integer n satisfying 1 2 q+1 &lt; n (m(q)2)=2, we present an algorithm which on input q and n produces an optimal bilinear algorithm of length 2n for multiplication in F q n =F q . The algorithm takes roughly O((q 3 + n 3 log 2 n log log n) log q) F q -operations to compute the output data. Our main algorithm partly relies on solving equations of the type x 2 + fix + ff = 0 in F 2 l for which we have presented an efficient randomized algorithm. We further discuss an algorithm to compute elliptic curves with the maximum number of points over F q where q is a perfect square.

Reference-contexts: done using O (n 2 M (n) log n log q) F q -operations. (See [29, Theorem 3.17] to see that this bound is also valid for the case of characteristic6= 2, since inverting a polynomial modulo an irreducible polynomial takes O (M (n) log n) F q -operations by <ref> [1, pp. 303] </ref>.) Computation of the class of a prime divisor is accomplished by replacing [29, Algorithm III-D] by the group law algorithm [31, III, x2.3].

If q is a perfect square, we suggest a faster method to construct elliptic curves with the maximum possible number of F q -rational points: These curves are supersingular and we use the very rich theory of supersingular curves to construct such a maximal curve.

While the case of characteristic 3 almost thoroughly relies on the results in [29], the case char F q = 2 calls for new methods. <p> Secondly, we extend the results of <ref> [29] </ref> to the case char F q = 2; 3. While the case of characteristic 3 almost thoroughly relies on the results in [29], the case char F q = 2 calls for new methods. One of the major problems here is the computation of prime divisors on elliptic curves over F q . <p> Next we discuss the above mentioned randomized algorithm to solve this equation. In view of our applications of these results we shall more generally consider in Section 2 the problem of solving Artin-Schreier-type equations modulo irreducible polynomials over F q . Thirdly, we speed up the trivial algorithms of <ref> [29] </ref> to compute elliptic curves over F q having many F q -rational points (Theorem 3.2). <p> Finally, we present in Section 5 an optimal algorithm for multiplication in F 27 =F 3 . This case is not covered by the results in Section 4, but the method we use resembles that of <ref> [29, Algorithm IV-B] </ref>. We have implemented our algorithms in Mathematica for the case of prime q. An implementation in AXIOM, which covers all cases for q, is in preparation. 2. <p> We have implemented our algorithms in Mathematica for the case of prime q.

Equations of Artin-Schreier Type In <ref> [29] </ref> the problem of finding square roots modulo irreducible polynomials over finite fields of odd characteristic was discussed. <p> So we can restrict ourselves to equations of the type x 2 + x = ff with ff 2 F q . In analogy to <ref> [29, Section 2] </ref> we want to discuss the following problem: given polynomials f; g 2 F q [x], g irreducible of degree n and having leading coefficient equal to 1 (for short: g 2 Irr n (q)) and f of degree less than n, we want to test if there exists <p> Then H p (x) decomposes completely in F p 2 [11, p. 250] and for every root of H p the curve E : y 2 = x (x 1)(x ) is supersingular.

Werther For the following computations we present F 3 as F 3 = f0; 1; 2g. In order to compute the optimal algorithm we are looking for, we follow <ref> [29, Algorithm IV-B] </ref> with minor modifications: First we compute an elliptic curve E over F 3 having 7 F 3 -rational points together with E (F 3 ). Next we compute a positive divisor D and a prime divisor p, both of degree 3, such that L (Dp) = 0. <p> Afterwards we compute a basis ff 1 ; : : : ; f 6 g of L (2D) such that ff 1 ; f 2 ; f 3 g is a basis of L (D). In order to compute the matrices and A of Step (v) of <ref> [29, Algorithm IV-B] </ref>, we first need to compute a set of points P 1 ; : : :; P 6 of E (F 3 ) such that [P 1 P 6 Q] 6= [D 3Q] where Q is as usual the neutral element of E (F 3 ). <p> Next we perform Steps (vi) and (vii) of <ref> [29, Algorithm IV-B] </ref> to obtain the matrices A and B which are the final outputs.

Reference-contexts: Elliptic Curves: A Brief Review. This section is dedicated to a review of some properties of elliptic curves (over finite fields) which are of interest to us. The facts of this subsection are all well known and can be found in standard textbooks such as <ref> [3, 31] </ref>. An elliptic curve over a finite field F q is an algebraic curve of genus one. <p> It can be shown that every elliptic curve E over F q can be transformed to one of the following Weierstra-forms by applying appropriate birational transformations <ref> [31, Appendix A] </ref>: y 2 = x 3 + ax + b; 4a 3 + 27b 2 6= 0; if char F q 6= 2; 3, y 2 = x 3 + ax 2 + b; ab 6= 0; if char F q = 3 and j (E) 6= 0, y <p> The set E (F q ) carries the structure of an abelian group with Q as the neutral element. The rules for "addition of points" in E (F q ) can be found in <ref> [31, III, x2] </ref>. We shall use these formulas below. We denote by the addition in E (F q ). <p> Algorithms on Elliptic Curves 11 (iii) If p 6 1 mod 3 is an odd prime, p 6= 3, then E: y 2 = x 3 + 1 has p + 1 F p -rational points. Proof. (i) Trivial.

(iii) Our assumptions on p imply that x 3 + 1 2 F p [x] is a permutation polynomial (see [32, Corollary 2.10]). <p> is also valid for the case of characteristic6= 2, since inverting a polynomial modulo an irreducible polynomial takes O (M (n) log n) F q -operations by [1, pp. 303].) Computation of the class of a prime divisor is accomplished by replacing [29, Algorithm III-D] by the group law algorithm <ref> [31, III, x2.3] </ref>. It is then not hard to see that computing the class of a given prime divisor requires O (nM (n)(log n + log q)) F q -operations.

Reference-contexts: Shokrollahi, K. Werther find an elliptic curve E over F q having at least N F q -rational points (if there exists one). Since it is easy to test the existence of such E by <ref> [34, Theorem 4.1] </ref>, we want to assume moreover that N is given such that the existence of E is guaranteed. As our solution we present is straightforward, we confine ourselves to an informal discussion. Suppose q is odd. <p> Obviously it is sufficient to show that any curve having m (q) F q -rational points is non-supersingular, i.e., has a non-vanishing j-invariant. By the discussions above and our assumption on q, an elliptic curve over F q is supersingular if and only if its j-invariant is 0. By <ref> [34, Theorem 4.1] </ref> E=F q is supersingular if and only if jE (F q )j has one of the values q + 1 or q + 1 p 2q. <p> Further let 2 F p 2 be a root of H p (x). Then E : y 2 = x (x 1)(x ) satisfies jE (F p 2 )j = p 2 + 1 2p. Proof. Since H p () = 0, E is supersingular, hence by <ref> [34, Theorem 4.1] </ref> jE (F p 2 )j = p 2 + 1 2p. fl Equipped with these results, we can now state the main theorem of this subsection: Theorem 3.7. Let q be an even power of a prime p. <p> In [25] it was proved that R (F q n =F q ) = 2n if 1 2 q + 1 &lt; n &lt; 1 2 m (q) where m (q) is the maximum number of points of an elliptic curve over F q .
