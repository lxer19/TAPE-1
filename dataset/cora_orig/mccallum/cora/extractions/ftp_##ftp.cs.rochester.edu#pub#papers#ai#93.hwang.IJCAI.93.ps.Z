Title: Meeting the interlocking needs of LF-computation, deindexing, and inference: An organic approach to general NLU

Abstract: We argue that a "theory bottleneck" encountered in the 70's and early 80's in attempts to build comprehensive NLU systems led to a fragmentation of NLU research, which still persists. To some extent, this fragmentation represents an appropriate response to the variety and subtlety of remaining problems; but at this point, it also represents a loss of nerve: NLU is an organic phenomenon, and enough has been learned about the vexing problems of the 80's to try to integrate these insights and build more comprehensive theories and extensible implementations. On that premise, we have been building such a comprehensive framework. Its centerpiece is Episodic Logic (EL), a highly expressive knowledge representation well-adapted to the interpretive and inferential needs of general NLU. The logic has been successfully implemented in the Epilog system, which has been applied to several domains proving EL's practicality: reasoning about small excerpts from the Little Red Riding Hood story, as a natural language interface for the Trains planning system at the University of Rochester, and for a message processing application at the Boeing Co.

Reference-contexts: This has the advantage that FOL is well-understood syntactically and semantically, but also has the disadvantage that very little real language is easily expressible in it. Consider, for instance, the first sentence of the dialog which was processed by the initial Trains-implementation <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> : "We have to make orange juice" This simple sentence exemplifies the following interesting semantic phenomena: it expresses an obligation (and puts that obligation, in part, on the hearer); it expresses joint agency; it is tensed (thereby expressing that the joint obligation is upon the hearer and speaker <p> The Epilog system [ 17 ] , the computer implementation of our logic, makes quite complex inferences, e.g., with utterances from the Trains domain <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> , telex reports for aircraft mechanical problems in the ARMS (the Boeing Commercial Airplane Reliability and Maintainability Project) domain [ 16 ] , and excerpts from Little Red Riding Hood story [ 19 ] . <p> Although we do not yet have grammars and LF rules for large subsets of English, the compositional approach of EL has been proven practical by a start-up implementation that has successfully handled dialogues in a planning system in the Trains domain <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> . See [ 10 ] for some of our grammar fragments. The ARMS application used a grammar and interpretation mechanism internal to the Boeing Co. 6 Concluding Remarks We think there is cause for optimism about the possibility of constructing theoretical and computational frameworks for full NLU.

Reference-contexts: As mentioned, it is based on a Montague-style coupling between syntactic form and logical form, while incorporating from situation semantics the idea that sentences describe situations (events, states, episodes, even 1298 tualities, etc.). 1 Moreover, all of this is implemented in at least a preliminary way. The Epilog system <ref> [ 17 ] </ref> , the computer implementation of our logic, makes quite complex inferences, e.g., with utterances from the Trains domain [ 1 ] , telex reports for aircraft mechanical problems in the ARMS (the Boeing Commercial Airplane Reliability and Maintainability Project) domain [ 16 ] , and excerpts from Little <p> For instance, in the above example, knowledge base fact [Joint6 ((attr hydraulic) joint)] led to immediate success.

Reference-contexts: The second rule is sound if contains no unmatchable free variables which are bound in R as a whole. So in particular, the first rule is sound if F contains only constants and top-level universal (hence matchable) variables. (See <ref> [ 18 ] </ref> for soundness proof.) As mentioned, the rules also work for generic conditionals, and we illustrate this case.
