Abstract: We consider a problem that arises in the design of data structures for answering visibility range queries, that is, given a 3-dimensional scene defined by a set of polygonal patches, we wish to preprocess the scene to answer queries involving the set of patches of the scene that are visible from a given range of points over a given range of viewing directions. These data structures recursively subdivide space into cells until some criterion is satisfied. One of the important problems that arise in the construction of such data structures is that of determining whether a cell represents a nonempty region of space, and more generally computing the size of a cell. In this paper we introduce a measure of the size of the subset of lines in 3-space that stab a given set of n polygonal patches, based on the maximum angle and distance between any two lines in the set. Although the best known algorithm for computing this size measure runs in O(n 2 ) time, we show that if the polygonal patches are orthogonal rectangles, then this measure can be approximated to within a constant factor in O(n) time.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, these two quantities will be small if patches of P define a narrow "tunnel" through which the stabbers must pass. Because the distance and angle taken from different domains, and since our size will depend on both, we normalize them over the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref> as follows. We assume that we are given an orthogonal cube C in 3-space that encloses the scene and all of the patches of P . Let D denote the diameter of C. <p> We define the normalized angle ang 0 (` p ; ` q ) to be sin ang (` p ; ` q ). Clearly both normalized quantities lie in the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. <p> orthogonal rectangles in 3-space, and suppose that we consider only lines in a single orthogonal sign class. (This will be the case if for each coordinate axis there is at least one rectangle in P orthogonal to this axis.) Amenta has shown in this case S (P ) is connected <ref> [1] </ref>, that is, if it is nonempty, then it has a single i-class. <p> Because all scalar multiples of Plucker coordinates represent the same line, 3 we may apply a suitable normalization by requiring that 01 + 02 + 03 = 1. From our assumption that lines are directed into the positive octant, these coordinates will all lie within the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. By computing bounds on these three normalized components for all lines in S (P ), we can bound the range of possible line angles. <p> Add to this set of halfspaces the constraint 01 + 02 + 03 = 1. Observe that any line directed into the positive octant intersects this plane in a point whose coordinates are in the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. It follows from Amenta's results [1] that the resulting system of O (n) linear inequalities is of LP-type [3]. <p> Add to this set of halfspaces the constraint 01 + 02 + 03 = 1. Observe that any line directed into the positive octant intersects this plane in a point whose coordinates are in the interval [0; 1]. It follows from Amenta's results <ref> [1] </ref> that the resulting system of O (n) linear inequalities is of LP-type [3].

Reference-contexts: Teller showed that in O (n 2 ) time it is possible to determine the existence of a transversal of these patches, and more generally to compute a complete description of the set of stabbing lines [10]. Amenta <ref> [2] </ref> showed that if the patches consist of a set of orthogonal (that is, 1 axis-aligned) rectangles, then the existence of a transversal can be determined in more efficiently in O (n) time by a variation of linear programming.

Reference-contexts: Observe that any line directed into the positive octant intersects this plane in a point whose coordinates are in the interval [0; 1]. It follows from Amenta's results [1] that the resulting system of O (n) linear inequalities is of LP-type <ref> [3] </ref>. For each axis, i 2 f1; 2; 3g, invoke any linear time procedure for generalized linear programming (in dimension 6) to determine lower and upper bounds on the i-th coordinate, denoted 0;i and + 0;i , respectively. If the system is infeasible, then return an indication of this. <p> If the system is infeasible, then return an indication of this. Otherwise return the maximum width, = max 0;i as the approximation. Observe that 0 1. The running time is dominated by the O (n) time needed for generalized linear programming in dimension 6 <ref> [3] </ref>. 5 Analysis In this section we show that the above algorithm returns a value that is within a constant factor of size (P ). In particular, we prove the following result.

Reference-contexts: A striking feature of lines in 3-space is that two lines may be in the same o-class relative to P , but are not in the same i-class <ref> [4] </ref>. We say that two directed lines ` p and ` q are in the same orthogonal sign class (s-class) if the signs of the components of the 3-dimensional directional vectors for the two lines are equal. There are 8 orthogonal sign classes, one for each of the coordinate octants.

Reference-contexts: Amenta [2] showed that if the patches consist of a set of orthogonal (that is, 1 axis-aligned) rectangles, then the existence of a transversal can be determined in more efficiently in O (n) time by a variation of linear programming. Megiddo <ref> [5] </ref> showed that the orthogonal case can be solved in O (n) time in all fixed dimensions through linear programming.

Reference-contexts: These data structures recursively subdivide space into cells until some criterion is satisfied. Such criterion typically involve the number of data objects that intersect the cell, but in the case of approximations may also involve the size of the cell, measured by its diameter or volume <ref> [7] </ref>. The problems of determining the size of a cell and whether a cell represents a nonempty region of space are implicit (and usually trivial) in the design of algorithms for building these data structures. <p> Megiddo [5] showed that the orthogonal case can be solved in O (n) time in all fixed dimensions through linear programming. This suggests one advantage of using orthogonal rectangles and lines in 3-space (as arise in quad-trees, k-d trees, and R-trees <ref> [7] </ref>, for example) as the basis of subdivisions of directed line space. An extension to this problem is that of determining not just the existence of a stabbing line, but various properties and functions of this set of lines.

Reference-contexts: 1 Motivation Computer graphics is the source of many interesting and challenging applications for the design of geometric algorithms and data structures. Applications in global illumination simulation and radiosity <ref> [8] </ref> have motivated our study of problems involving lines in 3-space. In particular we are interested in geometric data structures for answering visibility range queries.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to see that any positive scalar multiple of the coordinate vector represents the same line. Thus we can regard the Plucker coordinates of a directed line as a point in projective 5-space P 5 <ref> [9] </ref>. Not all Plucker coordinates represent lines in 3-space. The coordinates of a line in 3-space must satisfy the quadratic equation 01 23 + 02 31 + 12 03 = 0: The locus of points satisfying this equation is called the Grassmann manifold (also called the Plucker hypersurface).

Reference-contexts: Let n denote the total number of edges in all the patches. Teller showed that in O (n 2 ) time it is possible to determine the existence of a transversal of these patches, and more generally to compute a complete description of the set of stabbing lines <ref> [10] </ref>. Amenta [2] showed that if the patches consist of a set of orthogonal (that is, 1 axis-aligned) rectangles, then the existence of a transversal can be determined in more efficiently in O (n) time by a variation of linear programming. <p> Although we do not know of an efficient way to compute size (P ) without of computing a complete representation of S (P ) (which can be done in roughly O (n 2 ) time <ref> [10] </ref>), we claim that we can approximate the size in O (n) time.
