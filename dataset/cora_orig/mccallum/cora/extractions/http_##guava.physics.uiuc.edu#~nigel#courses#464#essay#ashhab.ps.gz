Title: Bose-Einstein Condensation in Confined Atomic Gases  
Author: Sahel Ashhab 
Note: In the end I will discuss some of the experiments that have been carried out to produce and study BEC. I will also discuss a prospective application of the phenomenon.

Abstract: Bose-Einstein Condensation is a phenomenon that occurs in boson systems where a finite fraction of the number of particles in the system occupy the single-particle ground state of the system. This phenomenon follows from the nature of Bose statistics and, therefore, behaves differently from a system of distinguishable particle. In this term paper I will give a review of Bose statistics to prepare for the study of BEC. Then I will derive the criterion at which the phase transition to the BEC phase occurs. I will try to give some intuitive explanation why such a phenomenon has to occur in boson systems. I will also discuss some properties of the boson system that follow from the mathematical development of the problem, and I will give some physical explanations for these properties.
