Abstract: The significance of collective communication operations for scalable parallel systems has been well emphasized by the recent Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard [20]. A large number of algorithms have been proposed in recent past to support these operations on wormhole-routed systems. However, some algorithms lack in specifying their exact scope. Similarly, some algorithms do not fully take into account the architectural characteristics of underlying wormhole-routed architecture in performance evaluation. This makes it difficult to compare different algorithms and select the best ones for practical implementation. In this paper, we emphasize on such issues. An overview of collective communication operations is provided. Four basic communication types are identified to be essential to implement these operations efficiently on any system. A representative set of algorithms for frequently-used collective communication operations are analyzed to reflect on how to make these algorithms practical from application, algorithm, and system perspective.

Reference-contexts: From the table, it can be seen that distributing non-personalized data and collecting result with constant data size are common to many operations. Though point-to-point (unicast) communication can be used to support all four communication types <ref> [1, 2, 3, 5, 14, 19, 25, 26, 27] </ref>, there have been several recent works to implement two of these types efficiently on wormhole-routed systems.

The phases are assumed to be logically synchronized. Many algorithms for all-to-all complete exchange fall into this category <ref> [3, 25] </ref>. Such algorithms provide easier ways to derive a lower/upper bound on the communication complexity. However, due to their synchronous nature, their predicted performance does not exactly match with that when implemented on the current generation wormhole-routed MIMD systems. <p> The indirect algorithms <ref> [3, 26] </ref> use combining where a given processor may receive messages from multiple processors, permute the data, and send it to another set of processors. Some algorithms combine direct and indirect approaches to come up with hybrid algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Recently, 12 attempts have been made to adopt such path-based concepts to current generation wormhole--routed systems using e-cube [8], planar-adaptive [7], fully-adaptive [10], and turn-models [12]. These works include the BRCP path model mentioned above [24], row/column path model <ref> [4] </ref>, and multidimensional path model for hypercubes [13]. All these works have been used to implement better broadcast/multicast algorithms. Such path-based concept has recently been extended by the author to other collective communication operations such as barrier synchronization [22] and global reduction [23]. <p> As mentioned in section 3, it is an open challenge to extend these path-based models to implement the other two communication types. Though such path-based models are quite stronger, it may require additional resources from the underlying wormhole routing system in order to be implemented. In <ref> [4, 24] </ref>, it has been shown that multiple consumption channels are required at every node to provide deadlock-free routing using such path-based models. Hence, while comparing and evaluating such algorithms with unicast-based algorithms, one should take into account these additional consumption channels and model them correctly.

Reference-contexts: Hence, while comparing and evaluating such algorithms with unicast-based algorithms, one should take into account these additional consumption channels and model them correctly. With such multidestination routing, messages need to carry multiple destinations on their headers. They can be encoded using either all-destination encoding [16] or special bit-destination encoding <ref> [6] </ref>. For both encoding schemes, the corresponding router formats need to be defined in such a manner so that it does not introduce additional overhead in processing these headers.

Reference-contexts: Global Reduction operations are primarily used in distributed memory systems. These operations include max, min, sum, or any user-defined functions. These operations are sometimes also referred to as global combine operations <ref> [9] </ref>. The MPI definition allows two versions of these operations. In the first version, the overall result is available to only one member. The second version allows the result to be available to all group members. Functionally, these operations are again many-to-one followed by one-to-many operation.

Reference-contexts: Under such scenario, it will not be fair to prove that a multi-port algorithm is better than its 1-port counterpart because it takes less number of steps. In <ref> [11] </ref>, different models are proposed to estimate the time duration of a step in a multi-port system. Such detailed analysis is essential for any multi-port algorithm so that it can be compared with other multi-port or 1-port algorithms in a fair manner.

Reference-contexts: Such dynamic implementations are a must while using multicast algorithms (instead of the naive implementation where the source sends individual messages to all destinations) to perform write invalidation/update in directory-based cache-coherency protocols <ref> [15] </ref>. Such multicast operation can not use a static algorithm because the home node (source of multicast) only knows the list of destinations and the destinations themselves do not know the members of such a mul-ticast group.

Reference-contexts: Such systems are being used for supporting either distributed-memory, shared-memory, or distributed-shared memory programming paradigms. In order to support these paradigms, these systems need fast implementation of collective communication operations, as defined by the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard <ref> [20] </ref>. Some frequently-used operations belonging to this class are: broadcast, multicast, barrier synchronization, and all-to-all exchange. Many algorithms have been proposed in recent past for different collective communication operations on wormhole-routed systems with various characteristics. While many algorithms are quite focused and well-defined, some are stated in a general manner. <p> Basic communication requirements are derived in section 3. Section 4 analyzes the practicality aspects of the algorithms. 2 Overview of Collective Communication Operations In this section, we provide a brief overview of the collective communication operations. For detailed description and the associated communication primitives, readers are requested to refer <ref> [20] </ref>. A complete survey of collective communication algorithms can be found in [18]. The definition of collective communication indicates that more than one processor are participating in the communication. These operations are defined over process groups.

Such systems are being used for supporting either distributed-memory, shared-memory, or distributed-shared memory programming paradigms.

We have defined a new Base Routing Conformed Path (BRCP) model <ref> [24] </ref> which captures flexibility of adaptive routing to define stronger and sophisticated routing paths. Using these paths we have shown how to efficiently implement multicast and arbitrary barrier synchronization. <p> Recently, 12 attempts have been made to adopt such path-based concepts to current generation wormhole--routed systems using e-cube [8], planar-adaptive [7], fully-adaptive [10], and turn-models [12].

Hence, such algorithms should be designed keeping the asynchronous nature of the current generation wormhole-routed systems in mind. 4.2.2 Direct, Indirect, or Hybrid Approach Some algorithms for all-to-all complete exchange are direct in nature <ref> [25] </ref>, i.e., each processor directly sends messages to each of its destinations using separate communication steps. The indirect algorithms [3, 26] use combining where a given processor may receive messages from multiple processors, permute the data, and send it to another set of processors.

Reference-contexts: From the table, it can be seen that distributing non-personalized data and collecting result with constant data size are common to many operations. Though point-to-point (unicast) communication can be used to support all four communication types <ref> [1, 2, 3, 5, 14, 19, 25, 26, 27] </ref>, there have been several recent works to implement two of these types efficiently on wormhole-routed systems. Multidestination message-passing and path-based routing [13, 16, 24] with broadcast worms have been proposed to implement distribution of non-personalized data with reduced cost. <p> The indirect algorithms <ref> [3, 26] </ref> use combining where a given processor may receive messages from multiple processors, permute the data, and send it to another set of processors. Some algorithms combine direct and indirect approaches to come up with hybrid algorithms.
