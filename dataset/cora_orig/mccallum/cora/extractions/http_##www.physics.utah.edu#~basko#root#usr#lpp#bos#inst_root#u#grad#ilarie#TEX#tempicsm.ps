Abstract: We have investigated the class of disubstituted polyacatylene (PDPA) such as pristine and doped with C 60 , using both transient and steady state spectroscopies. These polymers show strong photoluminescence and spectral narrowing at high excitation intensities despite of their ground state degeneracy. In PDPA-nBu/C 60 mixture we found photoinduced charge transfer from the degenerate ground state polymer chains to the C 60 molecules.

Reference-contexts: It is known that t-PA has a very weak PL in the infrared spectral range <ref> [1] </ref>, with a quantum efficiency h=10-5. Similarly, monosubstituted t-PA exhibits weak PL in the near infrared [2]. This weak PL from degenerate ground state polymers has been explained by the relative position of the lowest excited excitonic levels: 11Bu and 21Ag.

Reference-contexts: Futhermore , in some PDPA films it is possible to achieve laser action , or emission spectral narrowing, at sufficiently high excitation intensities <ref> [4] </ref>. Apparently the di-substitution of t-PA drastically changes the optical emission properties. This might be due to the fact that the substituted sides groups may influence the electronic energy states of the polymer backbone structure [4]. <p> possible to achieve laser action , or emission spectral narrowing, at sufficiently high excitation intensities <ref> [4] </ref>.

We also report the results of steady state PA spectroscopy studies of C 60 doped PDPA-nBu at different doping concentration. We obtained spectral evidence of photoinduced charge transfer from the excited state of this polymer onto adjacent C 60 molecule through PA measurements.

Reference-contexts: The spectrum contains only one PA band peaked at 1.7eV which is at much higher energy than the S+ absorption band induced upon iodine doping <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The absorption band of C 60 at 1.15eV and the accompanied vibronic structures have been revealed. This is in contrast to the common belief that in DGS polymers the photoinduced charge transfer is suppressed by soliton generation, being faster than the charge transfer process <ref> [6] </ref>. In addition, polaron and soliton PA bands were also identified.

Reference-contexts: In addition, polaron and soliton PA bands were also identified. Extensive studies were carry out recently on polymer/C 60 blends [?].In many polymer/C 60 mixtures the charge transfer is photoinduced, C 60 being a weak acceptor, while in others mixtures the charge transfer takes places in the ground state <ref> [9] </ref>. Transient spectroscopy measurements of C 60 doped MEH-PPV have demon-strated that the charge transfer occurs in less than 10-12 s following pulse photoexcitation, implying a high quantum efficiency for the photoinduced charged transfer process [10].

Reference-contexts: In this case the charge transfer is not favorable in the ground state. It has been shown that there are two different channels for photoinduced charge transfer: either e- transfer from the photoex-cited polymer chain or hole transfer from photoex-cited C 60 <ref> [13] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The weak PL in these DGS polymers have been traditionally explained by the soliton model, in which the primary excitations are soliton-antisoliton (S-S) pairs [14].Then upon photoexcitation the photogenerated e-h pair, which immediately (within 100fs) transforms into S+- S- <ref> [15] </ref>, relaxes very quickly (within 400ps) into a S0-S0pair with similar even parity structure as the 2Ag state [16].We believe that the strong PL in PDPA-nBu polymer originates from strongly bound S+-S-pairs, namely solitonic exciton, which do not imedi-atly transform into the S0-S0 manifold.

Reference-contexts: Strong PL in conducting polymers has been shown to be a good indication of high optical gain, when the polymer film is excited with short optical pulses at high excitation intensities <ref> [17] </ref>. Under these conditions emission spectral narrowing may occur at excitation densities above a certain , well defined threshold excitation level. The phenomenon of emission spectral narrowing in conducting polymers has been independently attributed to mirrorless lasing, amplifed spontaneous emission and superfluorescence [17]. <p> with short optical pulses at high excitation intensities <ref> [17] </ref>.

The phenomenon of emission spectral narrowing in conducting polymers has been independently attributed to mirrorless lasing, amplifed spontaneous emission and superfluorescence [17]. Regardless of the particular nature of this effect, it requires high optical gain, which results in stimulated emission.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that C 60 itself does not have any absorption features or PA bands between 0.05-1.4 eV <ref> [19] </ref>; the peak at 1.15eV and its vibronic structures are therefore due to C-60. These transitions were also observed in the absorption spectrum of C-60 generated by g ray irradiation [20] .

Reference-contexts: These transitions were also observed in the absorption spectrum of C-60 generated by g ray irradiation <ref> [20] </ref> . The photoinduced charg e transfer between the conjugated polymer chains and intercalated dopant is governed by energetics i.e. by the relative position of the polymer energy levels with respect to those of the dopant.
