Title: TAP-D: A Model for Developing Specialization Tracks in Graduate Software Engineering Education  
Author: Carol L. Hoover

Abstract: There is an increasing demand for application-specific software. For example, the software to control a machine on a factory floor is different from the software to manipulate large databases. The software engineer building software to control a motor that powers a piece of machinery needs some understanding of the motors servo system; whereas a software engineer who designs the software to manage large databases for the NASA Space Station needs specific knowledge about database models as well as the types of data handled on a long-term space vehicle. Specialization tracks within the Master of Software Engineering (MSE) Program at Carnegie Mellon University would enable students to gain application knowledge while developing fundamental software engineering skills. This report proposes a model for establishing specialization tracks within a graduate software engineering program.

Reference-contexts: The study also included discussions with financial planning and career development consultants as well as executives. In addition, the researchers reviewed recent literature in the business press which discussed these topics. <ref> [Dennis91] </ref> CMU-CS-93-181 32 Acknowledgments The author would like to thank Mary Shaw for her idea to incorporate specialization tracks into the MSE program and for her support in the design and implementation of these tracks.

Reference-contexts: As Guisbond wrote in 1990, specialization is a dominant trend that requires people to take an informed and directed approach to managing their careers. Those people with the best job opportunities are those who prepare for anticipated technology trends and who tailor their job searches accordingly. <ref> [Guisbond90] </ref> 4. The Conference Board is a nonprofit, bipartisan organization founded in 1916 to improve business enterprise systems and to enhance the contribution of business to society. Researchers in this organization conducted a study of trends in career management and financial planning during the fall of 1990.
