Title: From Earwigs to Humans  
Author: Rodney A. Brooks 
Address: 545 Technology Square Cambridge, MA 02139, USA  
Affiliation: MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  
Abstract: Both direct, and evolved, behavior-based approaches to mobile robots have yielded a number of interesting demonstrations of robots that navigate, map, plan and operate in the real world. The work can best be described as attempts to emulate insect level locomotion and navigation, with very little work on behavior-based non-trivial manipulation of the world. There have been some behavior-based attempts at exploring social interactions, but these too have been modeled after the sorts of social interactions we see in insects. But thinking how to scale from all this insect level work to full human level intelligence and social interactions leads to a synthesis that is very different from that imagined in traditional Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science. We report on work towards that goal.

The jury is still out as to whether these analysis tools will lead to great conceptual or practical advances. With these two changes, the earlier vocabulary of classical AI becomes largely irrelevant. Gone are explicit representations of beliefs, desires and intentions.

Why the title of this paper? "From Earwigs to Humans". It comes from a paper written by Kirsh (1991), titled "Today the earwig, tomorrow man?", written as a response to long delayed publication of my first manifesto on behavior-based robotics <ref> (Brooks 1991b) </ref>. The title was meant in a somewhat contemptuous spirit, arguing that behavior-based approaches, while perhaps adequate for insect-level behavior, could never scale to human-level behavior. The Cog project, and in a little way, this paper, are my response. Or, more precisely "Yes, exactly!".

There is a an interesting dualism between the two approaches to AI, where complementary aspects are designed-in explicitly to the systems, and converse aspects are emergent from the interactions of the parts that are designed in.

Reference-contexts: A vestibu-lar system using three orthogonal solid state gyroscopes and two inclinometers will soon be mounted within the head. 10 In the next revision a single tilt motor will drive the two eyes. The arm demonstrates a novel design in that all the joints use series elastic actuators <ref> (Williamson 1995) </ref>. There is a physical spring in series between each motor and the link that it drives. Strain gauges are mounted on the spring to measure the twist induced in it. A 16 bit shaft encoder is mounted on the motor itself.

Reference-contexts: We have carried out an analysis of the 42 papers which appeared in those volumes. There has been very little work in the way of evaluating the complexity or level of performance of robotic systems, behavior-based or otherwise. The closest perhaps to this is the practice, such as in <ref> (Wilson 1985) </ref>, of categorizing the environments in which the creatures, animats, or robots operate. Following that practice we defined six categories of the type and complexity of coupled environment-robot systems and then placed each of the 42 papers into one of these categories.
