Reference-contexts: This paradigm for image segmentation attempts to place a boundary at those locations where the magnitude of the intensity gradient of the image is large. Blake and Zisserman <ref> [1] </ref>, Mumford and Shah [2], Shah [4], and Pien and Gauch [3] have all written about various aspects of this form of segmentation and have proposed various complex energy functionals whose minima correspond to segmented images.
