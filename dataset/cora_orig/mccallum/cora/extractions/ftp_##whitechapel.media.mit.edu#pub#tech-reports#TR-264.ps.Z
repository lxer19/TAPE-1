Abstract: Submitted to: International Conference on Pattern Recognition, 1994. MIT Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Group Technical Report #264 Abstract In this paper we develop a method for the simultaneous restoration and halftoning of scanned fingerprint images using a novel non-linear dynamical system, called the "M-lattice system". This system is rooted in the reaction-diffusion model, first proposed by Turing in 1952 to explain the formation of animal patterns such as zebra stripes and leopard spots. A typical reaction-diffusion system is a set of heat equations, coupled by non-linear reaction terms. The new M -lattice system is closely related to the analog Hopfield network and the cellular neural network, but has more flexibility in how its variables interact. Furthermore, the state variables of an M-lattice system are guaranteed to be bounded, which is not the case with many reaction-diffusion systems. Due to this large-signal boundedness, the M -lattice system possesses desirable numerical properties that make it useful in engineering applications. Our new method for enhancing fingerprints explores the ability of the M-lattice system to form oriented spatial patterns (like reaction-diffusion systems), while producing binary outputs (like analog feedback neural networks). We compare the outputs of two approaches used to enhance the same original fingerprint: the new M-lattice system and adaptive thresholding, a common halftoning method employed in traditional fingerprint classification systems. The results indicate that the fingerprints synthesized by the M-lattice system retain and emphasize significantly more of the relevant image detail than do the fingerprints synthesized by the standard algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Turing in 1952 in order to explain coating mammalian patterns, such as, for example, zebra stripes, leopard spots, etc., and, until recently, reaction-diffusion systems have been researched predominantly by mathematical biologists working on theories of natural pattern formation and by chemists working on modeling the dynamics of complex chemical reactions <ref> [1] </ref>, [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. However, the past three years have seen a significant surge in interest in reaction-diffusion systems, primarily for exploiting them in the areas of computer graphics and image processing. <p> Finally, Section 5 summarizes the report. 2 Reaction-Diffusion System Turing's paper titled "The Chemical Basis of Morpho-genesis" was a first attempt to provide a scientific explanation for the patterns of pigmentation in animals <ref> [1] </ref>. Many mammals have prominent coat markings. For example, zebras have stripes, giraffes have contoured patches, leopards and cheetahs have spots; the furs of many dogs and cats also display various forms of stripes and patches of different color. <p> Thus, the system should be unaffected by homogeneous perturbations. Turing has determined the conditions on D A and D I , under which the system in (5) is stable to homogeneous (i.e., DC) perturbations and unstable to nonhomogeneous (i.e., AC) perturbations at least for one value of k x <ref> [1] </ref>. Turing gave the name "chemical wavelength" to this dominant spatial frequency, characteristic of (1). Intuitively, one often thinks of diffusion as a phenomenon that smoothes temperature and concentration gradients and brings stability. <p> Any solution trajectory of this diagonal-state clipped M -lattice system converges to a finite asymptot ically stable fixed point, ~ 2 &lt; N (or ~ 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref> N ). Thus far, no proof of total stability exists for the more general system, (8). However, fixed points of the form ~ 2 f1; 1g are asymptotically stable [17]. <p> system, (8), can be written as follows: d (~n; t) = a (~n) fl (~n; t) + s (~n) h (~n) fl (~n; t); (9) where ~n 2 Z 2 , a (~n) and h (~n) are the FIR filters, corresponding to A and H, respectively, and s (~n) 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref> is the original finely quantized input image signal. The advantage of using this type of the clipped M - lattice system for the pre-processing of fingerprints is that it can be guaranteed to produce binary outputs [17]. <p> The dominant orientation at a pixel is characterized by the angle, i 2 [; ], and by the relative strength (or magnitude), m i 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, of that angle's presence at pixel i. Each filter is a 2-D Gaussian, whose level sets are oriented ellipses. <p> Moreover, ridges and bifurcations have been extended even into the regions where they are barely detectable in the original image. This illustrates the celebrated synergetic property of reaction-diffusion systems: the emergence from noise of a spatial pattern, whose qualitative characteristics are pre-determined by the system's parameters <ref> [1] </ref>, [11]. Us ing the connection machine (CM-2), the final image is produced in 25 iterations at the time step of 0:1 sec.

Reference-contexts: We now summarize Turing's analysis. The cells of hydra are assumed to be equally spaced and comprise a periodic 1-D lattice with the period of N x cells.

Reference-contexts: The essential steps comprising the identification sequence are: determining the type of the fingerprint, counting of ridges and bifurcations, and locating the core. A binary fingerprint image is more amenable for these tasks than a gray-scale fingerprint image <ref> [27] </ref>. We propose a pre-processing scheme that not only halftones the original fingerprint image, but also removes artifacts that can hinder the identification process.

Reference-contexts: F ( ~ k) positive for a set of spatial frequencies creates the onset of growing spatially-stationary waves. 5 The adaptive filter, H ( ~ k), was designed so as to include the information about the dominant orientation at each pixel of the original image, shown in Figure 3 (a) <ref> [28] </ref>. The dominant orientation at a pixel is characterized by the angle, i 2 [; ], and by the relative strength (or magnitude), m i 2 [0; 1], of that angle's presence at pixel i. Each filter is a 2-D Gaussian, whose level sets are oriented ellipses.

Reference-contexts: One effort, which, incidentally, was not specifically targeted for fingerprint restoration, deals with replacing portions of fingerprints with patches, whose visual appearance resembles that of a generic fingerprint texture <ref> [30] </ref>, [31]. However, the inserted patch may turn out to be substantially dissimilar from the missing section of the original image. Another report describes the restoration of noisy fingerprints with a particular reaction-diffusion system [32]. However, the output image is not a halftone.

Another report describes the restoration of noisy fingerprints with a particular reaction-diffusion system <ref> [32] </ref>. However, the output image is not a halftone. Our new technique is inspired by these previous approaches and accomplishes restoration and halftoning simultaneously. The scratches have been removed and the unevennesses in the DC levels throughout the image have been eliminated.
