Abstract: In this paper we examine a class of nonlinear, stochastic knapsack problems which occur in manufacturing, facility or other network design applications. Series, merge & split topologies of series-parallel M=M=1=K and M=M=C=K queueing networks with an overall buffer constraint bound are examined. Bounds on the objective function are proposed and a sensitivity analysis is utilized to quantify the effects of buffer variations on network performance measures.

While the above design issues are extremely complex and interdependent, we have designed a methodological approach to the problem which should shed some light on these issues. 4.1 Introduction The methodology employed for arriving at the suboptimal decision variables relies on the Complex Method of BOX <ref> [5] </ref>, where the independent variables are the buffer values at the nodes and the objective function is the earlier mentioned objective function of the CND.

Reference-contexts: Starving occurs when the second station completes its work yet there are no parts in its buffer because the first workcenter is either busy or else has no work. In either of the situations, the system throughput is below the expected level <ref> [14] </ref>. Another situation for loss of capacity is the breakdown of a workcenter in the line. If there are no buffers, all the stations of the network have to be shut down either because of starving or blocking.

This procedure, using the previous bounding methods to estimate the throughput and the objective function of the network and Powell's procedure <ref> [29] </ref> for solving unconstrained nonlinear programming problems, calculates the allocation of buffer at the nodes based on the arrival rate, service rates of the nodes, routing of the entities and the assumption that there is no constraint on the total capacity of the network. 4.3 General Design Methodology The CND problem

Reference-contexts: Based on the developed model, the effect of buffers is evaluated and a method of determining the size of buffer capacity is suggested. Shanthikumar <ref> [30] </ref> derived a general formula for the production capacity of automatic transfer lines with unlimited buffer space and unreliable machines, where partially processed units are scrapped when a machine fails.

Reference-contexts: One of the examples utilized to prove this point is a case study done on buffer allocation <ref> [31] </ref>. The network has 10 nodes, of which 7 are in series, 2 nodes are in parallel and 1 node is the merge node. The arrival rate to the network is 40 and the service rate of most of the nodes in series is 60.

Reference-contexts: A dynamic programming approach is combined with a heuristic method to solve the above maximization problem. The paper presents numerical results for lines with three to eight nodes and shows results close to simulation results. Smith and Daskalaki <ref> [33] </ref>, [10] developed a systematic design methodology which produces near optimal routing and buffer space allocations in a series-parallel queueing network topology with exponential servers of finite capacity.

The bound is simple, direct, and easily programmable, although a formal induction proof of correctness has frustratingly eluded us at the present. <p> It is very difficult for the user to supply the right starting point since not much is known about the dynmamic behavior of the queues and no simple knapsack heuristic starting solution was found to be appropriate.

The results show that the methodology, proposed in the earlier section works successfully for all types of topologies. For each type of topology, light, medium and heavy traffic queues have been considered. <p> For all the experiments of the series the values of parameters in the objective function used are: P = $30:00=unit, V = $10:00=unit, H = $0:50=unit and C = $0:0=unit. These magnitudes of the parameters are similar to ones used in previous studies, <ref> [33] </ref>. We will show how variations in these parameter values affect the buffer allocation process in x6. <p> The second condition is appropriate because, as the authors discuss later, there are multiple sub-optimal solutions in situations such as very light traffic queues with relatively large capacity al location or more than the required capacity allocated to the topology. The results from unconstrained optimization are available in <ref> [33] </ref>, where the Expansion Method is used in com DocNum 7 . 5. 1. 0 Buffer Allocation typeset February 13, 1995 Smith & Chikhale Table 4: Series Network Results bination with Powell's unconstrained optimization routine. <p> As shown in the Table 4 and Table 5 the procedure is very effective and provides similar results. The results in Tables4 and 5 are arranged into two row sections for each experimental setup. Row #1 (first three lines a,b,c) contains the results obtained from unconstrained optimization <ref> [33] </ref>. Item (a) is the maximum value of the objective function obtained from unconstrained optimization. Item (b) is the value of the objective function obtained from simulating the topology with the same parameters. <p> For each simulation, 5 runs with 6000 customers/run were used with the first 1000 customers discarded to minimize the effects of the initial conditions and assure steady-state results. The simulations results are available in the form of means in <ref> [33] </ref> and not in the form of confidence intervals. Item (c) is the optimal buffer vector solution from Powell's routine. The second row (the next four lines d,e,f,g) contain the results obtained from using the BOX constrained optimization procedure. <p> used for the splitting and merging topologies is M aximizeZ = fi (P V ) HL N X x i C i N X x i B The values of the parameters in the objective function are: P = $30:00=unit, V = $10:00=unit, H = $0:50=unit and C = $0:50=unit, <ref> [33] </ref>. The results for splitting topologies are shown in Table 6. Two sets of splitting topologies have been considered. Each set of topologies has only one node, termed the splitting node, in the splitting queue. <p> For all the experiments of the merging queues, the values of parameters in the objective function used are: P = $30:00=unit, V = $10:00=unit, H = $0:50=unit and C = $0:50=unit, <ref> [33] </ref>. The results are exhibited in the same manner as those for the series and splitting topologies. The basis for validation is also the same as that for the series and splitting topologies as explained earlier.
