Reference-contexts: Thus, a workable database can be created with far less programming effort than in fields where problems need to be retrieved and entered independently. We began to create such a database in conjunction with the OOPSLA 97 Reuse in the Classroom workshop <ref> [Geh 98] </ref>. Keep in mind that, the larger an assignment is, the less likely it will be reusable as is. In algorithms or architecture, it is quite possible for one instructor to borrow another instructors problem in its entirety, especially if both instructors use the same textbook.

Reference-contexts: The database uses the same software as a database that is used for online physics testing <ref> [TMB 98] </ref>, so ultimately it could be used to do computerized testing in computer architecture. The workshop and database It makes sense to collect problems into a database in those subject areas where instructors typically assign logic-design problems, derivations, or proofs, etc. to their students.
