Title: ASSOCIATION FOR AUTOMATED REASONING NEWSLETTER of you or your colleagues have open questions to take
Author: William McCune 
Note: From the AAR President, Larry Wos... Since the Robbins problem has now been settled, do any  The Robbins problem|are all Robbins algebras Boolean?|has been solved: Every Robbins algebra is Boolean. This theorem was proved automatically by EQP, a theorem-proving program developed at Argonne National Laboratory. The Problem In 1933, E. V. Huntington presented [1,2] the following  was later studied by Tarski and his students [6], but no proof was found.

Abstract: This issue of the AAR Newsletter was completed in 1996 but, because Argonne closes for two weeks in December, did not get printed until January. So, it's a grand way to end the old year| with McCune's solution to the long-standing Robbins problem. And it's a grand way to start the new year|with a new challenge competition for automated reasoning programs and with several new books for eager reviewers.
