Abstract: In this paper we propose mobile sensors and self-reconfiguring robots to increase the versatility of mobile robots in unstructured environments. Mobile sensors enrich the class of on-line algorithms that can be performed with fixed architecture robots by providing flexibility in information gathering and extraction from the world. A self-reconfiguring robot can autonomously and dynamically reconfigure in a variety of shapes to support multiple modalities of locomotion, manipulation, and sensing. We describe experiments with mobile sensors and self-reconfiguring robots.

Reference-contexts: In the next section we describe our progress towards creating self-reconfigurable robots. 3 Self-reconfiguring Molecules: An Example We have designed a small and simple robotic module we call a Molecule capable of self-reconfiguration in three dimensions <ref> [ Kotay et al, 1998 ] </ref> . The Molecule is a 4 degree-of-freedom, small-scale module capable of aggregating with other identical modules to form three-dimensional dynamic structures. <p> One degree of freedom allows rotation about one connector. The second degree-of-freedom allows rotation of the atom about the bond. Detailed descriptions of the design and control of the Molecule can be found in <ref> [ Kotay et al, 1998 ] </ref> . The Molecule can connect with other identical Molecules to create dynamic three dimensional geometric structures. It is possible to create arbitrary three-dimensional geometric shapes consistent with the Molecular structure. These three-dimensional shapes can only have surfaces that meet at angles of 90 degrees. <p> In <ref> [ Kotay et al, 1998 ] </ref> we present algorithms of similar flavor for performing convex and concave transitions. in a staircase. 3.2 Molecule Stair Climbing In [ Kotay and Rus, 1998 ] we showed that Molecule pairs can be vertically stacked. <p> Finally, all remaining Molecule pairs are moved to the top of the new tower, completing the ascent of one step (Figure 4 (Bottom, Right)). This process is then repeated for each step. In the above algorithm, Molecule pairs move using linear motion, concave transition, and convex transition algorithms <ref> [ Kotay et al, 1998 ] </ref> . These algorithms are specified at the level of very basic control, as a sequence of individual rotations.

Reference-contexts: While an individual Molecule can only move relative to other Molecules, a Molecule structure is also capable of global motion relative to an environment. For example, a structure consisting of four Molecules is sufficient for doing linear translations and 90 degree rotations on a floor <ref> [ Kotay and Rus, 1998 ] </ref> . 3.1 Molecule Motion Molecule motion is controlled by attaching an atom to some other Molecule and actuating one or more of the four degrees of freedom of the Molecule. <p> In [ Kotay et al, 1998 ] we present algorithms of similar flavor for performing convex and concave transitions. in a staircase. 3.2 Molecule Stair Climbing In <ref> [ Kotay and Rus, 1998 ] </ref> we showed that Molecule pairs can be vertically stacked. The ability to stack pairs can be used to develop a stair climbing algorithm as follows (see Figure 4). <p> Our experiments show that individ-ual Molecules can be controlled to move relative to other Molecules to effect linear motion and convex and concave transitions. These results are promising. We plan to build 16 Molecules to evaluate our self-reconfiguring planning theory. We are also developing motion planning for self-reconfiguration <ref> [ Kotay and Rus, 1998; McGray and Rus, 1998 ] </ref> .

Combining cooperation with robot manipulation are, e.g., [ Noreils 1993 ] , [ Parker 1994 ] , <ref> [ Yamamoto 1994 ] </ref> , [ Beckers et al, 1994 ] , and [ Don-ald et al, 1993; Rus et al, 1995; Donald et al, 1996 ] . <p> Each demonstrates the manipulation of a box or other large object using two mobile robots. [ Noreils 1993 ] describes a task in which one robot pushes a box and another robot clears obstacles out of the way. <ref> [ Yamamoto 1994 ] </ref> describes a system in which two mobile robots equipped with grippers move while holding an object. [ Parker 1994 ] builds an architecture designed to achieve fault-tolerant cooperation within teams of heterogeneous mobile robots. [ Beckers et al, 1994 ] treats successfully a foraging task in which
