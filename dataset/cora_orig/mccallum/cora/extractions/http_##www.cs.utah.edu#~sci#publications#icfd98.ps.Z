Abstract: We present an overview of SCIRun, a scientific problem solving environment that allows the interactive construction, debugging, and steering of large-scale scientific computations. Using this "computational workbench," a scientist can design and modify simulations interactively via a dataflow programming model. SCIRun enables scientists to design and modify model geometry, interactively change simulation parameters and boundary conditions, and interactively visualize geometric models and simulation results. We show an integrated prototype problem solving environment for computational fluid dynamics may be constructed by combining SCIRun with the Tetrad/CSPRINT codes. The success of the approach is illustrated by using the resulting code to solve an atmospheric diffusion example consisting of time dependent p.d.e.s on unstructured tetrahedral spatial meshes.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we give an overview of the SCIRun 1 [11] problem solving environment and focus on incorporating an unstructured tetrahedral mesh solver, called Tetrad, [3], and use it with the CSPRINT time integration software <ref> [1] </ref> within SCIRun to solve a transient atmospheric diffusion problems with multiple species on an unstructured adaptive tetrahedral mesh. <p> These changes must be matched by changes in the spatial mesh and the timesteps if high resolution is required, [4]. The difference in time-scale between the reaction of these species leads to stiff systems of equations which require implicit numerical solvers and special linear equations solvers <ref> [1] </ref>. The requirements of such a problem are that it is necessary to combine: * Unstructured tetrahedral mesh generation and adaptation. * Physically realistic spatial discretisation methods. * Stiff ode integrators tailored to the application. * Fast interactive visualization for multi-species flows * Computational steering facilities for transient problems. <p> These requirements were met by combining the SCIRun software with the spatial discretisation, mesh adaptation and time integration codes CSPRINT and TETRAD <ref> [1, 3] </ref> and by wrapping these codes in SCIRun modules, with converters to map to the SCIRun data structures, see Section 5 below. 3 SCIRun Dataflow System SCIRun composes computational and visualization algorithms with these data elements using a dataflow style "boxes and wires" approach. <p> This system of o.d.e's can then be solved as an initial value problem, using the software tools that exist for this purpose <ref> [1] </ref>. For advection dominated problems it is important to choose a discretisation scheme which preserves the physical range of the solution [3]. <p> The time integration method used is the theta method module of the CSPRINT software which is designed for the moderate accuracy solution of stiff systems using local error control in time, <ref> [1] </ref>. Once the p.d.e's have been discretized in space we are left with a large system of coupled o.d.e's of dimension m fi n where m is the number of mesh points, and n the number of species.

Reference-contexts: More importantly, it is the responsibility of the application programmer to ensure that parameter changes make sense with regard to the underlying problem physics. The application we consider here is taken from a model of atmospheric dispersion from a power station plume a concentrated source of NO x emissions, <ref> [2] </ref>. The photo-chemical reaction of this NO x with polluted air leads to the generation of ozone at large distances downwind from the source. An accurate description of the distribution of pollutant concentrations is needed over large spatial regions in order to compare with field measurement calculations. <p> For n chemical species an n-dimensional set of partial differential equations (p.d.e's) is formed where each is coupled through the nonlinear chemical reaction terms.

The reaction rate constants have been chosen as in Tomlin et al. [4]. and the photolysis rates were parametrised as a function of the solar zenith angle, see [4]. The background concentrations listed by <ref> [2] </ref> form the initial conditions for the model. These concentrations will then change diurnally as the chemical transformations take place. The power station is taken to be the only source of NOx and this source is treated by setting the concentration in the chimney set as an internal boundary condition.

This ensured that the mesh would be refined to a reasonable resolution in this region of steep gradients. These meshes are then refined and coarsened by the TETRAD <ref> [3] </ref> mesh adaptation module which is based on the refinement of tetrahedra into 8 tetrahedra with appropriate adjustments to ensure that the mesh is conforming at the edges. <p> The criterion for the application of the adaptivity used in this work is based on refining or derefining the mesh based on the magnitude of solution gradients of the key chemical species NO and NO 2 across the faces of the tetrahedron, see <ref> [3] </ref>. For applications such as atmospheric modeling it is important that a maximum level of refinement can be set, to prevent the code from adapting to too high a level in regions with concentrated emissions. This is especially important if sources which are close to point sources in nature exist.
