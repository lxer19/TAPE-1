Abstract: To meet the goals outlined for the National Information Infrastructure (NII), the Center for Applied Information Technology (CAIT) must establish a program to meet the challenge of providing interoperability of various NII-based collaboration services in a heterogeneous hardware and software environment. This paper outlines a plan designed to achieve these goals by fostering coordination with other relevant CAIT activities, providing a migration path from the existing collaboration technology, and simultaneously encouraging industry to build the infrastructure necessary for tomorrow's collaborative NII applications and environments.

Reference-contexts: Computersupported collaboration can augment traditional educational settings at all educational levels by supporting access to knowledge and data, providing easy access to geographically distributed experts, battling skills obsolescence, and training staff who in today's industry are increasingly required to be more skilled and operate independently <ref> [CARN90] </ref>. Obtaining goods, services, and associated customer services (i.e., electronic commerce). NII can be used to support interactive product demonstrations and customer/salesperson interaction in the customer's business or home, which will save time for both customers and salespersons, increase customer convenience, and provide better access for the physically challenged.

Reference-contexts: Any "ideal" solution based on defining an interoperability infrastructure and standard and then building products to meet that standard will take too long to implement, has questionable marketability, and will not accommodate the enormous number of useful products and services already in use <ref> [CRAI94a] </ref>. Thus, this program must encourage the funding of the design and development of enabling technologies which provide a migration path from existing collaboration systems to next-generation interoperability that is needed for long-term evolution of NII. This approach will have a higher payoff at a lower overall cost.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, application-invasive enablers are generally packaged as collaboration toolkits. Examples include SRI's SCOOT <ref> [CRAI94b] </ref> and Bellcore's Rendezvous [HILL94]. Such toolkits have the potential of providing a significant degree of independence from particular GUI environments, while at the same time providing more efficient and robust collaboration services.

Reference-contexts: In addition, 2 companies can provide timely and interactive customer support, and directly diagnose problems using remote information appliances. Because one of NII's goals is to promote interoperability and open standards <ref> [IITF93] </ref>, one challenge for the development and deployment of the NII is to ensure that the various existing computersupported collaboration technologies can be used together and leveraged to define a common NII standard.

Reference-contexts: This is because Interop applied pressure to vendors to demonstrate interoperability by requiring that they connect to the show network in order to participate in the vendor exhibition <ref> [INTE91] </ref>. This requirement forced network-level interoperability 5 and encouraged growth of Internet-related products and companies (e.g., over 500 exhibitors demonstrated products at Interop in 1994). Although products shown at Interop demonstrated network-level interoperability, they do not require or show networkservice and application-level interoperability required for collaboration services, utilities, and tools.

Reference-contexts: For example, a state public health official examining and retrieving health plan records to identify an upswing in pertussis 7 collaborates with test laboratories to confirm the diagnosis, and coordinates with other communities to obtain additional supplies of the needed vaccine <ref> [ITF93] </ref>. Another dimension to providing a path that enables free flow between synchronous and asynchronous collaboration is providing seamless transitions between private and shared workspaces, where each participant is in full control of his or her local resources.
