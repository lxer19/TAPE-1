Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of "algorithm vs. representation" for case-based learning of linguistic knowledge. We first present empirical evidence that the success of case-based learning methods for natural language processing tasks depends to a large degree on the feature set used to describe the training instances. Next, we present a technique for automating feature set selection for case-based learning of linguistic knowledge. Given as input a baseline case representation, the method modifies the representation in response to a number of predefined linguistic biases by adding, deleting, and weighting features appropriately. We apply the linguistic bias approach to feature set selection to the problem of relative pronoun disambiguation and show that the case-based learning algorithm improves as relevant biases are incorporated into the underlying instance representation. Finally, we argue that the linguistic bias approach to feature set selection offers new possibilities for case-based learning of natural language: it simplifies the process of instance representation design and, in theory, obviates the need for separate instance representations for each linguistic knowledge acquisition task. More importantly, the approach offers a mechanism for explicitly combining the frequency information available from corpus-based techniques with linguistic bias information employed in traditional linguistic and knowledge-based approaches to natural language processing.
