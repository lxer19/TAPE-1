Reference-contexts: Detailed measurements of the grass canopy density and moisture profiles were made at a later time <ref> [1] </ref>. Figure 2 presents a view of the experimental area looking north. Electrical power was obtained from outlets within the fenced research enclosure. A telephone line was extended from a shed within the enclosure.

Reference-contexts: And, the REBEX-0 canopy was shorter and much less uniform in height, orientation, and composition. The soil at the REBEX-0 site was sandier and had less humus than the rich Great Plains soil at the REBEX-1 site. Quantitatively, the REBEX-0 grass had a lower column density <ref> [2] </ref>. * REBEX-0 took place toward the end of the growing season, well before senes cence, while REBEX-1 began just before the vegetation became sensescent. * Twice-daily soil and vegetation samples were collected during a large part of the REBEX-0 period compared with 7 samples during all of REBEX-1. * Estimates <p> Microwave sky brightness temperatures under non-cloudy conditions are typically low at the SSM/I frequencies, and reflection from grass vegetation is small <ref> [2, 4] </ref>. So, the contribution of ground brightness leakage and emission from (hot) housing components to the "sky" brightnesses observed by the radiometers could be quite significant. No attempt to correct IR or microwave sky temperature values for door-related problems was made for REBEX-0 data.

Reference-contexts: This was in preparation for REBEX-1, our first full-length experiment, which was scheduled to begin in September in Sioux Falls, South Dakota <ref> [3] </ref>. During REBEX-0, we were concerned with learning how to deploy and operate TMRS-1 under field conditions, as we had never done either before, and were originally not so worried about getting useful data. <p> Color photos were also taken. 3 Instruments The instruments used during REBEX-0 were identical to those used during REBEX-1. They are listed and described briefly in this section, but for more detailed descriptions, including sensor specifications, the reader is referred to <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.1 Radiometers "Radiometers" here refer to the microwave and infrared radiation sensors, not the solar shortwave and net radiation sensors, which are also called "radiometers" by some. The TMRS-1 radiometers were located in a metal housing at the top of a 10-meter tower. <p> The uncorrected sky brightness values are presented in this report for completeness and for use in other work for which they may be useful (e.g., studies of sky emission). A correction scheme was presented in the REBEX-1 report <ref> [3] </ref> and may be applied directly to REBEX-0 data as the exact same housing configuration was used for both experiments. Rounding and significant figures The precision of each data variable is reflected in the number of significant figures retained in the archived data files|consult the README file.

Reference-contexts: Occasionally, the format "jjj.fff" will also be used where fff is the time of day expressed as a decimal portion of a day. All times are with respect to US Eastern Daylight Savings Time (EDT), which is 4 hours behind Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) for our purposes <ref> [5] </ref>. 4.1 Automatic Measurements Every 10 minutes, all of the instruments were read automatically, and the output values were recorded. These "experiments" began at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 minutes past the hour and lasted 3 minutes.
