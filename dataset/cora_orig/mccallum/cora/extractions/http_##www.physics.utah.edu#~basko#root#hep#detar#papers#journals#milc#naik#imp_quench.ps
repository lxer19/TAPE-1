Abstract: We investigate light hadron spectroscopy with an improved quenched staggered quark action. We compare the results obtained with an improved gauge plus an improved quark action, an improved gauge plus standard quark action, and the standard gauge plus standard quark action. Most of the improvement in the spectroscopy results is due to the improved gauge sector. However, the improved quark action substantially reduces violations of Lorentz invariance, as evidenced by the meson dispersion relations. 12.38.Gc, 14.20.-c, 14.40.-n

Reference-contexts: The P4 action yields the same tree-level improvement as the Naik action. (For a comparison with a renormalization group improved free staggered quark action, see the last paper of Ref. <ref> [5] </ref>.) The energy and pressure of the Naik fermions approach the continuum ideal fermion gas limits much faster than the standard Kogut-Susskind action. Indeed, the Bielefeld group [10] reported an improved thermodynamic behavior even when the interacting gauge fields are included in a dynamical quark Monte Carlo simulation. 8 III.

Reference-contexts: This problem has been addressed by the development of improved [1-3] and fixed-point [4,5] actions. The promise of these actions is to yield good approximations to the continuum physics with relatively coarse lattice spacings. (For a recent review, see <ref> [6] </ref>.) In the Symanzik improvement scheme [1,2] the lattice action and fields are improved in powers of the lattice spacing a. This is achieved by introducing higher dimensional terms into the action.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we study the improvement of the staggered (Kogut-Susskind) quark lattice QCD action with quenched spectroscopy calculations. The improvement is implemented by adding a third-nearest-neighbor term, first proposed by Naik more than a decade ago <ref> [7] </ref>. Some of the preliminary results of this study have already been published in [8,9]. The same improvement scheme has been applied to nonzero temperature calculations by Karsch et al. [10]. <p> In this case, the difference from the Kogut-Susskind action is a discrete version of the 3rd order derivative: 1 f (x + ^) f (x ^) 24 2a a 2 @ 3 The staggered action with a third nearest neighbor term was originally proposed by Naik <ref> [7] </ref>. However, he was studying the improvement of the Dirac-Kahler action, which has a 5 different coupling to the gauge fields than the action in Eq. (8).

Reference-contexts: However, this situation would become reversed, if we used a p instead of am to set the scale. lattice spacings with the improved gauge. A successful additional improvement of the Kogut-Susskind flavor symmetry is the MILC "fat link" fermion action <ref> [9] </ref>. That action substitutes the standard gauge links with smeared average links in the fermion hopping terms. The averaging process improves the flavor symmetry dramatically, the improvement being roughly comparable both for the standard Kogut-Susskind and the Naik action. <p> Similarly, improving the gauge action reduces the amount of flavor symmetry breaking, but using the Naik action yields little further gains. For both of the actions the flavor symmetry can be further improved with the `fat link' procedure <ref> [9] </ref>. The biggest improvement provided by the Naik action comes from the improved Lorentz invariance of the hadronic states. This is best evidenced by the -meson dispersion relation, which is much closer to the continuum behavior when the Naik action is used.

Reference-contexts: The improvement is implemented by adding a third-nearest-neighbor term, first proposed by Naik more than a decade ago [7]. Some of the preliminary results of this study have already been published in [8,9]. The same improvement scheme has been applied to nonzero temperature calculations by Karsch et al. <ref> [10] </ref>. The gauge configurations used in this study are generated with an O (a 2 ) one-loop and tadpole-improved gauge action [2,3]. <p> In the nonzero temperature calculation in Ref. <ref> [10] </ref> the action (8) was used with the `tree-level' values. C. Properties of the free quark action The free quark dispersion relation E (p) can be found from Eq. (13), by solving for the poles of the Euclidean propagator and using the identification E = Re ip 0 . <p> Indeed, the Bielefeld group <ref> [10] </ref> reported an improved thermodynamic behavior even when the interacting gauge fields are included in a dynamical quark Monte Carlo simulation. 8 III. THE SIMULATIONS AND THE RESULTS A. Hadron spectrum The parameters of the action (1) used in the generation of the quenched configurations are shown in Table I. <p> II C, the free quark continuum dispersion relation is approximated much better by the Naik action than by the standard Kogut-Susskind action. At very high temperatures, deep in the quark-gluon plasma phase, the quarks behave approximately as free particles, and the Naik action improves QCD thermodynamics <ref> [10] </ref>. However, a priori it is not clear whether the dispersion relation of hadronic states is improved.

Reference-contexts: An excellent baseline for the evaluation of the improvement is provided by our extensive standard (non-improved) quenched Kogut-Susskind hadron spectroscopy calculation <ref> [11] </ref>. 2 To complete the investigation one could also measure the spectrum with the combination of standard gauge and improved quark action. <p> While this could emphasize the role of the various levels of improvement to the final results, it would also increase the computation time substantially (especially if we used the large stored configurations used in ref. <ref> [11] </ref>). Since the gains provided by the improved gauge actions are well known by now, we take here the pragmatic approach and consider only the three combinations which, we believe, are most likely to be used in practice. <p> Throughout the analysis we quantify the performance of the improved actions by comparing the results against a non-improved benchmark | an extensive standard quenched Kogut-Susskind hadron spectroscopy study by the MILC collaboration <ref> [11] </ref>. In particular, we use fi Wilson = 6=g 2 = 5:54 (16 3 ), 5.7 (24 3 ), 5.85 (24 3 ) and 6.15 (32 3 ) lattices (with the spatial volume in parentheses). <p> For comparison, we also plot the m N =m mass ratio obtained with standard non-improved Kogut-Susskind action at fi = 5:54, 5.7 and 5.85 <ref> [11] </ref>; these couplings correspond roughly to the same lattice spacing as the improved action at fi pl = 7:4, 7.75 and 7.9. <p> Since in the leading order m 2 / m q , these become power series in m 1=2 q . For the standard Kogut-Susskind action, the chiral extrapolations have been discussed in detail in <ref> [11] </ref>. Extrapolation of the ratio m N =m to the chiral limit m ! 0 or even to the physical limit m =m 0:1753 is sensitive to the form of the selected chiral fit function ansatz. <p> When this is taken into account, acceptable fits with a coefficient compatible both in sign and magnitude with QPT are possible. This is studied in detail for our standard gauge Kogut-Susskind hadrons in Ref. <ref> [11] </ref>. Since such fits do not appear to change the extrapolated/interpolated values significantly from (15), but do increase the errors, we prefer to leave out the am term. The error propagation is taken into account by performing the (fully correlated) fits separately to each of the jackknife blocks. <p> In most cases, it would be possible to obtain acceptable fits also with the simpler ansatz with either c 3=2 or c 2 fixed to zero. However, while the full ansatz (15) works quite well for the standard Kogut-Susskind hadrons <ref> [11] </ref>, these simplified functions do not. In order to facilitate the comparisons between the different actions, we retain the full chiral ansatz (15) here. <p> However, since there always is measured data at 13 m =m &gt; 0:7 (Figure 5), the chiral fit function only interpolates between measure-ments at m =m = 0:7. Indeed, when we use different chiral fit functions (for details, see ref. <ref> [11] </ref>), the changes in m N =m remain smaller than one standard deviation. * As the quark mass is lowered, the difference between the two types of quarks in the improved gluonic fields is reduced. <p> Using the same gauge action for both the Kogut-Susskind and the Naik calculations allows us to separate the effect of the fermionic improvement from the improvement of the gauge action. The latter is studied by comparing the results presented here to our 19 standard Kogut-Susskind results, ref. <ref> [11] </ref>. We do not attempt to study the effect of im-proved fermions in combination with unimproved gauge. This investigation could further distinguish the separate effects of the gauge and fermion action improvements, but it would increase the computational cost substantially.

Reference-contexts: This corresponds to a redefinition of the lattice gauge coupling g 2 ! g 2 =u 4 0 . With these ingredients, the coefficients of the action (1) are related by the 1-loop expres sions <ref> [12] </ref> fi rt = 20 u 2 (1 + 0:4805ff s ) (5) fi pl 0 where the strong coupling constant is determined through the 1-loop relation ff s = 4 log (u 0 )=3:0684 : (7) The leading errors of this action are of order O (a 2 ff 2

Reference-contexts: This is not transparent in Eq. (8), nor can one easily identify the leading irrelevant terms when the continuum limit is taken. At the free fermion level, perhaps the easiest way to see this is to use the following transformation <ref> [13] </ref>: in momentum space, we decompose the momentum vector k = p + A=a, A = 0 or 1, and we restrict 0 k &lt; =a.

Reference-contexts: It is not at all obvious that the interacting Kogut-Susskind action is still O (a) -accurate. In order to see the flavor structure more clearly, one usually performs the (local) transformation originally proposed by Kluberg-Stern et al. <ref> [14] </ref>. It transforms the 6 1-component staggered field to a hypercubic 16-component `quark field' (4 flavors of 4--component Dirac spinors), which lives on a lattice with twice the original lattice spacing.

Reference-contexts: The quark field action cannot be written in a compact form, but when expanded in powers of the lattice spacing a it has apparent dimension-5 terms (giving rise to O (a) errors). However, the Kogut-Susskind action does not have on-shell O (a) errors. This has been shown by Sharpe <ref> [15] </ref> and Luo [16,17] by a generalization of the Kluberg-Stern et al. transformation. The leading scaling violations start at O (a 2 ). In order to cancel them, one has to add dimension-6 terms to the action; these terms have been classified by Luo [17].

Reference-contexts: The leading scaling violations start at O (a 2 ). In order to cancel them, one has to add dimension-6 terms to the action; these terms have been classified by Luo <ref> [17] </ref>. The terms fall into two classes: D 3 terms, where D 3 is a generic combination of 3 covariant derivatives (and to which class the `Naik term' in Eq. (8) belongs), and 4-fermion terms.

Reference-contexts: In Fig. 2 we show E=T 4 and P=T 4 for free Kogut-Susskind, Wilson and Naik fermions as functions of the inverse lattice spacing. Also shown are the results from the Bielefeld "P4" staggered action <ref> [18] </ref>: like the Naik action, it contains a 3rd nearest neighbor coupling, but in this case the neighbors are coupled along L-shaped paths (the Naik (x)U (x)U (x + ^)U (x + 2^) (x + 3^) -terms are replaced with terms of form (x)U (x)U -(x + ^)U -(x + ^

Reference-contexts: The reason for this effect is probably the large extent in the imaginary time direction of the Naik derivative operator in Eq. (8) <ref> [19] </ref>. The transfer matrix is well defined only at imaginary time separations larger or equal to 3. The ghost branch in the dispersion relation can also cause short distance effects in the correlation function.

If one includes a term / (am q ) 1=2 in (15), the fits invariably prefer a positive sign for the coefficient; whereas QPT gives a negative sign.

Reference-contexts: The box sizes are considerably larger than 2 fm (with the possible exception of fi pl = 7:9), so that we can safely ignore the finite size effects <ref> [21] </ref>. For the weakest coupling and the smallest quark mass, the product m fi (Lattice size) is approximately 3.0. Besides the mass of the -meson, the square root of the string tension is commonly used to determine the lattice spacing.
