Reference-contexts: Jgraph attempts to provide a simple, yet flexible and powerful graph-plotting package. It is a filter that takes a description of a graph or graphs as input, and produces PostScript <ref> [1] </ref> as output. PostScript was chosen because it is a standard format for producing high-quality graphic output.

Reference-contexts: There are other graph-plotting programs for non-UNIX systems, such as CricketGraph [6] and Excel [5] for the Macintosh and other personal computers, and RS/1 <ref> [2] </ref>, a massive data processing package available on VMS. None of these are portable to Unix systems, nor are any of them free software.

Reference-contexts: The two standard UNIX programs for graph-plotting are graph [7] and grap <ref> [3] </ref>. Like jgraph, both are non-interactive filters, with graph producing output for the UNIX plot routine, and grap producing pic output for inclusion in troff documents. Graph is a primitive program whose functionality comprises a restricted subset of jgraph's.

Reference-contexts: Their interactiveness, however, makes them more cumbersome to use than jgraph for all but the simplest of plots, and in the tasks to which both they and jgraph are applicable, jgraph has the simpler interface. There are other graph-plotting programs for non-UNIX systems, such as CricketGraph [6] and Excel <ref> [5] </ref> for the Macintosh and other personal computers, and RS/1 [2], a massive data processing package available on VMS. None of these are portable to Unix systems, nor are any of them free software.

Reference-contexts: There are many interactive programs for drawing graphs: Xgraph <ref> [8] </ref>, Gnuplot [10], and Mathematica [12] all run under UNIX. Xgraph is best described as graph with an Xwindows interface. Like graph, it suffers from a lack of flexibility.

Reference-contexts: Figures 5 and 6 show further examples of complex, structured drawings that are straightforward to produce with jgraph but would be difficult to produce with a WYSIWYG tool. Figure 5, from <ref> [9] </ref> is a jgraph drawing which depicts processor communication over time.

Reference-contexts: Since jgraph is non-interactive, it can be used as a back-end graphics language for making drawings that use graph constructs (such as axes and legends) or that have an iterative structure. Figure 4 is an example by Dave Wortman <ref> [11] </ref> which uses jgraph in such a way. The input file for this picture was created by a nawk script that processes data and emits jgraph output. ``WYSIWYG'' drawing tools like xfig or MacDraw are not suited for such tasks.
