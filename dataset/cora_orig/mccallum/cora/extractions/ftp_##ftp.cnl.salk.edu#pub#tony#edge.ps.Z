Abstract: Field (1994) has suggested that neurons with line and edge selectivities found in primary visual cortex of cats and monkeys form a sparse, distributed representation of natural scenes, and Barlow (1989) has reasoned that such responses should emerge from an unsupervised learning algorithm that attempts to find a factorial code of independent visual features. We show here that non-linear `infomax', when applied to an ensemble of natural scenes, produces sets of visual filters that are localised and oriented. Some of these filters are Gabor-like and resemble those produced by the sparseness-maximisation network of Olshausen & Field (1996). In addition, the outputs of these filters are as independent as possible, since the info-max network is able to perform Independent Components Analysis (ICA). We compare the resulting ICA filters and their associated basis functions, with other decorrelating filters produced by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and zero-phase whitening filters (ZCA). The ICA filters have more sparsely distributed (kurtotic) outputs on natural scenes. They also resemble the receptive fields of simple cells in visual cortex, which suggests that these neurons form an information-theoretic co-ordinate system for images.

Reference-contexts: Olshausen & Field demonstrated [12] that such a sparseness criterion could be used to self-organise localised, oriented receptive fields. Here we present similar results using a direct information-theoretic criterion which maximises the joint entropy of a non-linearly transformed output feature vector <ref> [5] </ref>. Under certain conditions, this process will perform Independent Component Analysis (or ICA) which is equivalent to Barlow's redundancy reduction problem. Since our ICA algorithm, applied to natural scenes, does produce local edge filters, Barlow's reasoning is vindicated. <p> W Z is related to the transforms described by Atick & Redlich [3]. Example ZCA filters and basis functions are shown in Fig.1b. (3) Independent Components Analysis W I (ICA), is the Factorised (semi-local) solution [f u (u) = i f u i (u i )].

The `infomax' solution we describe here is related to the approaches in <ref> [5, 1, 6] </ref>. As we will show, in Section 5, ICA on natural images produces decorrelating filters which are sensitive to both phase (locality) and spatial frequency information, just as in transforms involving oriented Gabor functions or wavelets. <p> In these senses, ICA is different from PCA and ZCA, and cannot be calculated analytically, for example, from second order statistics (the covariance matrix), except in the gaussian case. The approach which we developed in <ref> [5] </ref> (see there for further references to ICA) was to maximise by stochastic gradient ascent the joint entropy, H [g (u)], of the linear transform squashed by a sigmoidal function, g. <p> the p.d.f.s are super-gaussian (meaning they are peakier and longer-tailed than a gaussian, having kurtosis greater than 0), we have repeatedly observed, using the logistic or tanh nonlinearities, that maximisation of H [g (u)] still leads to ICA solutions, when they exist, as with our experiments on speech signal separation <ref> [5] </ref>. Although the infomax algorithm is described here as an ICA algorithm, a fuller understanding needs to be developed of under exactly what conditions it may fail to converge to an ICA solution. The basic infomax algorithm changes weights according to the entropy gradient.

Olshausen & Field demonstrated [12] that such a sparseness criterion could be used to self-organise localised, oriented receptive fields. <p> Part of the difference in our results is therefore attributable to different preprocessing techniques. The distributions (image histograms) produced by PCA, ZCA and ICA are generally double-exponential (e ju i j ), or `sparse', meaning peaky with a long tail, when compared to a gaussian, as predicted by Field <ref> [7] </ref>. The log histograms are seen to be roughly linear across 5 orders of magnitude. The histogram for the ICA filters, however, departs slightly from linearity, being more peaked, and having a longer tail than the ZCA and PCA histograms.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction. Both the classic experiments of Hubel & Wiesel <ref> [8] </ref> on neurons in visual cortex, and several decades of theorising about feature detection in vision, have left open the question most succinctly phrased by Barlow "Why do we have edge detectors?" That is: are there any coding principles which would predict the formation of localised, oriented receptive fields? Barlow's answer
