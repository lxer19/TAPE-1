Title: Cardinal Series Interpolation to Nonuniform Grids  
Author: John C. Strikwerda

Abstract: We consider Whittaker's cardinal series interpolation from a uniform grid to a nonuniform grid. It is shown that the interpolation is a bounded linear map if and only if a constraint on the clustering of the nonuniform grid is satisfied. An error estimate is also presented showing the spectral accuracy of the cardinal series interpolation. Mathematical Classification: 41A05

Reference-contexts: Interpolation between grids is an important part of many computational procedures. Perhaps the most important current application arises in domain decomposition methods. Domain decomposition is used as a means to decompose large problems into smaller subproblems that can be solved in parallel, see the collections of paper [2] and <ref> [1] </ref> for examples of the use of domain decomposition.

Reference-contexts: The principle technique used in the proofs is borrowed from the work of Paley and Wiener on almost periodic functions <ref> [4, page 108] </ref>. In section 2 we give the basic definitions, define the interpolation operator, and give the clustering constraint to be satisfied by the grid mapping to give a bounded operation. <p> The essential ideas of this proof are due to Paley and Wiener <ref> [4] </ref> and used by them in their study of almost periodic functions.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In this paper we consider Whittaker's cardinal series interpolation between a uniform grid and a nonuniform grid. Cardinal series interpolation is a limiting case of cardinal spline interpolation <ref> [5] </ref>, and is also a limit for interpolation by finite Fourier series as the extent of the grid increases. <p> The classical cardinal series is an interpolant of a sequence of data fu gin` 2 to a continuous function f (x); such that f (-) = u for all -; and is defined by f (x) = -=1 sin (x -) ; see the preface to <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> The cardinal series is the limit of piecewise polynomial spline interpolation, see lecture 9 of <ref> [5] </ref> and is also connected to theory of discrete entire functions, see [3]. Theorem 3.1. The cardinal series interpolation operator ; given by (3.2), is a bounded operator from L 2 (hZ) to B if and only if the function ' satisfies the clustering constraint.
