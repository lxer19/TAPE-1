Abstract: In this paper we describe a number of intelligent data analysis techniques to pre-process and analyze data coming from home monitoring of diabetic patients. In particular, we show how the combination of temporal abstractions with statistical and probabilistic techniques may be applied to derive useful summaries of patients' behaviour over a certain monitoring period. Finally, we describe how Intelligent Data Analysis methods may be used to index past cases to perform a case-based re trieval in a data-base of past cases.

Reference-contexts: The onset and development of diabetic complications is strictly related to the degree of metabolic control that can be thus achieved <ref> [ DCCT, 1993 ] </ref> . The patients perform self-monitoring of bgl and glycosuria (glucose in the urine) at home several times a day, usually before meals, and report the monitoring data and the therapy followed in a diary.

More formally, following Fayad <ref> [ Famili et al., 1997 ] </ref> , we can say that data pre-processing is "a transformation T that transforms the raw real world data vectors X, to a set of new data vectors Y such that: (i) Y preserves the information in X, (ii) Y eliminates at least one of the

Reference-contexts: to derive both well-known and new indicators in an integrated fashion, by soundly taking into account the incompleteness of the available data set. 2.2 Temporal Abstractions tas are methods that can be used to obtain an abstract description of the course of multi-dimensional time-series by extracting their most relevant features <ref> [ Keravnou, 1995 ] </ref> . Hence, in patient monitoring, ta methods provide a useful instrument for summarizing the patient's history by transforming the fragmentary representation provided by the raw data into a more compact one based on series of abstract episodes.

The mapping between the qualitative abstractions and the quantitative levels of each numerical variable depends on the time-slice and on the specific patient's characteristics.

Reference-contexts: In our approach it is easy to derive the bg-md by calculating the marginal probability distribution of the bgl from the as time series. In particular, in this context it is possible to resort to a Bayesian technique described in <ref> [ Ramoni and Sebastiani, 1996 ] </ref> that is able to deal with incomplete probabilistic models. Let us suppose that we have a discrete variable with K states.

Reference-contexts: We propose to index the cases on the basis of two classes of features: simple features. The patient's identity, sex, age, weight, therapeutic protocol (as formally derived in <ref> [ Riva and Bellazzi, 1995 ] </ref> ), and glucosylated hemoglobin seem the natural indicators to be used. Each of such features can be codified with a single identifier (number, string). derived features.

Reference-contexts: Since in our application we consider three bgl state tas, Hypoglycemia, Normoglycemia, Hyperglycemia, K is equal to 3. As the monitoring process proceeds, the bounds on the probabilities <ref> [ Riva and Bellazzi, 1996 ] </ref> are updated. At any time we obtain, for each time slice, an interval probability distribution over the bgl state abstractions. The modal day can be then extracted by taking the bgl states with the highest p inf in each time slice. <p> In particular, since some data are missing, it is of interest to derive a probabilistic model expressed through the probability distribution of the next as given the past history of abstract states <ref> [ Riva and Bellazzi, 1996 ] </ref> . Such kind of models are able to explain the occurrence of critical situations detected during the monitoring period, and hence may be exploited to tailor the therapy to each patient. <p> In this case, it is possible to apply a Bayesian hierarchical model for conditional probability learning, able to preserve the patient's individuality while borrowing strength from population data (see <ref> [ Riva and Bellazzi, 1996 ] </ref> ). 5 Data analysis example In order to better explain the herein proposed methodologies we will consider a fourteen years-old female patient, monitored for a period of 165 days (about six months).
