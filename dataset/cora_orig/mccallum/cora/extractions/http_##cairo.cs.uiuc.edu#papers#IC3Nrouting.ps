Abstract: The goal of Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing is to find a network path which has sufficient resources to satisfy certain constraints on delay, bandwidth and/or other metrics. The network state information maintained at every node is often imprecise in a dynamic environment because of non-negligible propagation delay of state messages, periodic updates due to overhead concern, and hierarchical state aggregation [6]. The information imprecision makes QoS routing difficult. The traditional shortest-path routing algorithm does not provide satisfactory performance with imprecise state information. We propose a distributed routing scheme, called ticket-based probing, which searches multiple paths in parallel for a satisfactory one. The scheme is designed to work with imprecise state information. It allows the dynamic tradeoff between the routing performance and the overhead. The state information of intermediate nodes is collectively used to guide the routing messages along the most appropriate paths in order to maximize the success probability. The proposed algorithm consider not only the QoS requirements but also the cost optimality of the routing path. Extensive simulations show that our algorithm achieve high call-admission ratio and low-cost routing paths with modest overhead. The algorithm can tolerate high degree of information imprecision.

Reference-contexts: We propose a distributed QoS routing scheme that works with imprecise state information. While in this paper we only study the NP-complete delay-constrained least-cost routing problem, our scheme can also be applied to other routing problems such as bandwidth-constrained least-cost routing <ref> [1] </ref>. A path which satisfies the delay (or bandwidth) constraint is called a feasible path. The design goal of our heuristic algorithm is to find a low-cost feasible path by using only the available imprecise information. <p> The flooding algorithm has a very high message overhead. SP has the lowest overhead. TBP has an overhead higher than that of SP but much lower than that of the flooding algorithm. The overhead of TBP increases as the imprecision rate increases. Readers are referred to <ref> [1] </ref> for some simple heuristics which reduce the message overhead of TBP significantly. 5.3 Average path cost Figures 8-9 compare the average path cost of the three algorithms. In Figure 8, TBP has a much lower path cost than the flooding algorithm and SP.

Reference-contexts: Routing consists of two basic tasks. The first task is to collect the state information and keep it up-to-date. The second task is to find a satisfactory path for a new connection based on the collected information. Most published routing algorithms <ref> [2, 8, 9, 11] </ref> require every node to maintain a global network state either by a distance-vector protocol or by a link-state protocol. However, such a global state is in-heritly imprecise in a dynamic network where the traffic load changes constantly.

Reference-contexts: On the contrary, the goal of our algorithms is to find a low-cost feasible path. Third, the algorithms in [6, 7] are source routing algorithms. The routing path is locally computed at the source node. Our algorithm does distributed routing. The path is computed by a restricted diffusion computation <ref> [3] </ref>. It avoids the expensive centralized computation at the source, and collectively utilizes the state information kept at intermediate nodes to find a path. Multi-path parallel routing is used to increase the probability of finding a low-cost feasible path.

Reference-contexts: Third, the hierarchical approach is likely to be used to solve the scalability problem of routing in large networks <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It floods routing messages from the source to the destination. Each routing message accumulates the delay of the path it has traversed, and the message proceeds only if the accumulated delay does not exceed the delay bound. As shown by Shin and Chou <ref> [10] </ref>, when certain scheduling policies are used and the routing messages are set to the appropriate priority, the routing messages travel at speeds according to the link delays. Hence, the message traveling along the least-delay path arrives first.
