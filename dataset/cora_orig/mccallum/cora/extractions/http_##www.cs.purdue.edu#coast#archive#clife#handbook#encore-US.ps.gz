Reference-contexts: the other hand, papers should also focus on analysis and show differences from more traditional heuristics in an easily understandable way (see e.g. [MH93]), discuss possible alternative directions of research [Khu94, KBH94a, KBH94b], give gentle surveys on a particular issue [FAT94], or provide tutorial introductions to a whole EC paradigm <ref> [Whi93, BBM93a, BBM93b] </ref>. Also, apart from these sometimes rather dry theoretical approaches to the research field, almost all currently available software packages which are related to the EC field have been included into ENCORE for the learning-by-doing concept which is useful in scientific research.
