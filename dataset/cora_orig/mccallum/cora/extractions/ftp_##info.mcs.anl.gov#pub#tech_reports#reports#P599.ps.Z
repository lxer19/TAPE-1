Title: Virtual Reality Visualization of 3-D Electromagnetic Fields  
Author: Milana Huang David Levine Larry Turner Lauri Kettunen Michael Papka 
Abstract: One of the major problems in three-dimensional (3-D) electromagnetic field computation is visualizing the calculated field. Virtual reality techniques can be used as an aid to this process by providing multiple viewpoints, allowing immersion within the field, and taking advantage of the human ability to process 3-D spatial information. In this paper we present an example of 3-D electromagnetic field visualization in the CAVE virtual-reality environment.

Reference-contexts: CRTs are also used to project onto large screens. Correct stereoscopic images are sent to the viewer's eyes by using two displays, one for each eye, or by using one display with shuttered or polarized glasses. The viewer's position and movements are tracked by magnetic or ultrasonic sensors <ref> [1] </ref>. Control devices include the dataglove and the force-feedback joystick [6]. The CAVE 1 (CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment) [3] is the virtual reality system we used. The CAVE is a three-meter cube in which the user is surrounded by stereoscopic computer images rendered on the walls and floor.

An arrow is a line segment whose length is proportional to the magnitude of the vector and whose orientation depicts the vector's direction. A probe is a set of graphic primitives expressing a number of local characteristics such as curvature and torsion.

Reference-contexts: Audio cues include localized sound and synthesized sound. Interactivity refers to the real-time involvement the user must have with the perceived environment. Virtual reality strives to be a natural user interface. It allows the scientist to focus the data, rather than the computer interface <ref> [5] </ref>. The objective is an environment that our senses are accustomed to and process well, in particular, 3-D spatial information [6]. A variety of technologies exist to enable virtual environments. Visual displays are implemented with cathode ray tube (CRT) or liquid crystal display technology.

Reference-contexts: Volume visualization can also be used to visualize vector fields. An isosurface is generated by defining a function that interprets vector values into scalar values, such as magnitude for electromagnetic fields <ref> [11] </ref>. All points that are above (below) a specified scalar value generate a surface. Although such techniques are widely used, limitations still exist.
