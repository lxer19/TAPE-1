Abstract: Visual servoing, i.e. the use of the vision sensor in feedback control has been of increasing interest. Work has been done by applications in autonomous driving, manipulation, mobile robot navigation and surveillance. However, theoretical aspects of the problem have not received much attention. The problem of estimation of necessary quantities from the vision measurements has been considered separately from the design of the control strategies. Instead of addressing the estimation and control problems separately, we attempt to characterize the types of control tasks which can be achieved using purely the quantities directly measurable in the image, bypassing the estimation phase. We consider a navigation task of a nonholonomic ground mobile base cast as a problem of tracking an arbitrarily shaped continuous ground curve. The control problem is formulated as one of controlling the shape of the curve in the image plane. We study the controllability of the system characterizing the dynamics of the image curve, and show that the shape of the image curve is controllable only up to its linear curvature parameters. We present stabilizing control laws for tracking piecewise analytic curves, and propose to track arbitrary curves by approximating them by piecewise linear curvature curves.

Generalization of the curve tracking and estimation problem outlined in Dickmans for arbitrarily shaped curves addressing both the estimation of the shape parameters as well as control has been explored in <ref> [4] </ref> by Frezza and Picci. They used an approximation of an arbitrary curve by a spline, and proposed a scheme for recursive estimation of shape parameters of the curve and designed control laws for tracking the curve. <p> Basically, there are two different approaches that one might take in order to track such a curve: first, one may use some estimation schemes and based on the estimated features of the real curve to apply the feedback control law (as studied by Frezza and Picci <ref> [4] </ref>); second, one may just smoothly connect these chunks of the image curve by straight lines, arcs or linear curvature curves and then apply the virtual tracking scheme as given in the above to track the approximating virtual curves. 5 Discussion and Future Work In this paper, we assume that the

Therefore, one can arbitrarily control the shape of the image of a linear curvature curve.
