Abstract: Molecular structure determination is an important task in biology because of the intimate relation between form and function of biological molecules. Individual sources of information about molecular structure are subject to uncertainty and are not sufficiently abundant to define the structure to high accuracy by themselves. We have examined a probabilistic algorithm, PROTEAN, which can incorporate multiple sources of uncertain data to estimate the three-dimensional structure of molecules and also predict a measure of the uncertainty in the estimated structure. We have applied this algorithm successfully to several biological structure problems. Like most structure prediction methods, this algorithm is computationally expensive for realistic biological macromolecules. In this paper, we experiment with speeding up the algorithm through the application of parallelism. We present a parallel version of the algorithm, and demonstrate good speedups on a 32-processor Stanford DASH, a cache-coherent shared-address-space multiprocessor. The results were obtained by exploiting data locality only in the per-processor coherent caches, without attempt to distribute data intelligently in the physically distributed main memory of the machine. We also obtained very good speedups on a state-of-the-art commercial multiprocessor, the Silicon Graphics Challenge. Finally, we propose an extension to the serial algorithm which enables it to handle a wider class of data, and discuss the potential for parallelization of the extended algorithm.

Reference-contexts: However, these late constraints will lead to more coordinated movement because the nonzero covariances contain information about how coordinates can change together. Figure 1 summarizes the sequential algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>. do cycle = 1, maxcycle // outer loop: repeat process until convergence reset covariance matrix to // heuristic for avoiding local minima, initial high values // similar to reheating in simulated annealing do i = 1, num_constraints // apply each constraint (z=h (x)+v) to structure do j = 1, maxiter <p> Multiple-Constraint Update One issue that came up when we were examining possibilities for parallelism was how many constraints to introduce at a time in the update phase. The original sequential algorithm introduces scalar constraints one at a time, mainly to avoid complicated matrix operations such as matrix inversion <ref> [1] </ref>. However, it is not clear that this is optimal, even for the sequential algorithm. It may be beneficial to introduce multiple constraints at a time. <p> The iteration over the pairs of points can be divided among the processors. The corrections of the violations are calls to the update routine (phase (2)). (5) Reordering constraint application: The order in which constraints are introduced can often affect the rate of convergence (but not the final result) <ref> [1] </ref>. The sequential algorithm uses two heuristics to facilitate convergence. One is to sort the constraints based on the errors calculated in phase (3) of the previous cycle, in decreasing order of error magnitude.

Reference-contexts: NMR spectroscopy does not have these problem, but NMR data can be noisy and sparse. Effective determination of structures solely from NMR data has been limited to small molecules [7]. Other sources of information about molecular structure include theoretical considerations and statistical analyses of known structures <ref> [2] </ref>, but these too are not abundant or accurate enough to provide high resolution structural models by themselves. Thus, it is important to be able to use data from multiple types of sources in structure determination. <p> It has been applied successfully to the determination of protein structure from NMR data [3] and to the prediction of RNA structure using constraints derived from theory <ref> [2] </ref>. Like other structure prediction methods, the algorithm used by PROTEAN is computationally expensive for interesting biological molecules. It is therefore natural to look to parallelism for speeding up the algorithm. <p> We also added information about three-way Hoogsteen base pairs inferred from sequence analysis <ref> [2] </ref>. FFATRNA is a higher-resolution version of FATRNA and has 504 points and 4922 constraints. 3. The Sequential Algorithm The underlying algorithm of the PROTEAN program is based on the extended Kalman filter [14].

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, structure determination is a difficult task. Of the estimated 100,000 protein molecules that are made within the human body, the structures of only about 1000 have been determined and deposited in the Protein Data Bank <ref> [4] </ref>. Experimental methods have been a primary source of information about molecular structure. However, it is often difficult and expensive to obtain sufficient high-quality experimental data for accurate structure determination.

Reference-contexts: The applicability of Xray crystallography is limited by the fact that not all proteins crystallize, and that the crystalline forms of molecules are not exactly the same as their forms in solution <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Experimental Framework Most of our parallelization experiments were performed on the Stanford DASH multiprocessor <ref> [8] </ref>, an experimental research multiprocessor built at Stanford University. DASH supports an implicit shared-address-space communication abstraction in hardware (as opposed to explicit message-passing paradigms such as in the Intel iPSC and Paragon or the Connection Machine CM-5), with hardware-supported cache-coherence. <p> Although the address space is logically shared, the main memory is physically distributed. Every cluster has an equal fraction of the physical memory on the machine. All caches in the system are kept coherent in hardware using a distributed directory-based protocol <ref> [8] </ref>. Our parallel programs are written in FORTRAN using the macro package from Argonne National Laboratories for parallelism constructs. We also ran our parallel program on a Silicon Graphics Challenge, which is also a shared-address-space multiprocessor.

Energy minimization and molecular dynamics consider the physical forces between atoms and try to find a conformation of the molecule that has the lowest energy <ref> [9] </ref>. Typically, these methods are run multiple times with different initial configurations to get a sense of the variability in structure, but this can lead to biased sampling [10].

Reference-contexts: Typically, these methods are run multiple times with different initial configurations to get a sense of the variability in structure, but this can lead to biased sampling <ref> [10] </ref>. In addition, these methods are not explicitly probabilistic; there is no simple way of incorporating probabilistic sources of data that are likely to be increasingly important, and of extracting information about the uncertainty in the calculated structure.

Reference-contexts: The functions of biological molecules are intimately related to the three-dimensional arrangement of their constituent atoms; thus, the study of how molecules perform their functions and the design of drugs to augment or interfere with these functions requires an understanding of the molecules' structure <ref> [13] </ref>. Unfortunately, structure determination is a difficult task. Of the estimated 100,000 protein molecules that are made within the human body, the structures of only about 1000 have been determined and deposited in the Protein Data Bank [4].

The Sequential Algorithm The underlying algorithm of the PROTEAN program is based on the extended Kalman filter <ref> [14] </ref>. A structure is represented by a state vector x of coordinates (3 N coordinates for N atoms) and a covariance matrix C . The main diagonal of C contains the variances of the atomic coordinates, while the off-diagonal elements represent the covariances between positions.

Reference-contexts: Before we fan out again for the next batch of constraints, we combine these updated structures to form a single estimate. The combination process is a Bayesian weighted sum, with higher weights given to more likely paths. The details of weighting and recombination can be found in <ref> [15] </ref>.
