Abstract: The Video on Demand service is expected to become one of the most popular offerings with the introduction of multimedia ATM networks. Several options are available for the support of such service. In this paper we investigate an approach which exploits ATM Virtual Private Networks. We use a Token Protocol and Fast Resource Reservations to achieve good utilization of network and video server resources and to allow for dynamic load balancing among multiple Information Warehouses. We also investigate the use of "caches" in Central Offices to further improve bandwidth efficiency. Simulation results shows that this approach is feasible and effective.

Reference-contexts: Hence, it makes sense to have copies of these most popular movies close to the users, namely in the COs.

Reference-contexts: The thin VCs are managed by an AVPN manager and we assume that the ATM network provides signaling for setting them up, but no flow control is applied to them. Since these VCs are assigned no bandwidth, the Fast Resource Management protocol <ref> [BRM92, ITU96] </ref> is used to allocate bandwidth to them before traffic can be sent over them. The control VCs are low speed CBR VCs. The IWHs store copies of all the movies that are offered by the VoD service. The storage medium is a Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAIDs). <p> However, the IHW is only connected to the IAP through a thin VC, as described above. Hence, before data can actually be transferred, a temporary allocation of bandwidth to the thin VC must be made, which is accomplished by using the Fast Resource Management (FRM) strategy initially proposed in <ref> [BRM92] </ref> and standardized by ITU-T in [ITU96]. In our model, the FRM mechanism implemented is the ATM Block Transfers with Delayed Transmission (ABT/DT) described in [ITU96].

Reference-contexts: The ATM network provider only enforces the peak policing on the AVPN VPs. For topology design and congestion control in AVPNs see [GF95]. A scheme for the management of the AVPN using a token passing protocol and fast reservations was proposed in <ref> [C + 96] </ref>. In this paper, we improve upon that scheme by exploiting the fact that some movies are more popular than others (e.g., new releases). Hence, it makes sense to have copies of these most popular movies close to the users, namely in the COs. <p> When the STU is finished playing one of the IAP's buffer, it requests the next block. The IAP switches to the other block and initiates the token protocol to request the following block from the IWH. For further information on IWHs, IAPs and STU, see <ref> [C + 96] </ref>. 2.1 The Multi Token Protocol and Fast Reservations The Multi Token Exchange (MTEX) protocol was designed to support the distribution of time sensitive data in a bursty environment. <p> Through this FRM mechanism, the IWH requests that the peak bandwidth allocated to all VPs traversed by the VC connecting the IWH and the IAP be reserved to this VC. Once again, the reader is referred to <ref> [C + 96] </ref> for a full description of the steps needed to carry out the booking of bandwidth for the thin VCs. <p> If the bandwidth reservation to the VC is not successful, an FRM release cell is sent back to the IWH to signal a blocking on the requested assignment. The IWH can then take several possible actions as described in <ref> [C + 96] </ref>. In the one considered in our study, the IWH uses the MTEX protocol to send an Abort message back to the requesting IAP, Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: The AVPN may be viewed as an additional cost in the proposed scheme vis a vis the simplicity of the CBR service. However, the use of the AVPN for burst transmissions is not a strict requirement, especially if the public ATM networks support FRM. Furthermore, AVPN provides service benefits <ref> [CFF + 95] </ref>. To start, the VoD provider can "depend" on the bandwidth provisioned in the AVPN, regardless of public network congestion.

Reference-contexts: Prior to transmit, the IWH informs all the other IWHs of its intention, using a multicast VC control (as supported, for example, by the OPENET, open ATM network management platform <ref> [CHK + 95] </ref>). The burst transmission is promptly aborted if a path/bandwidth conflict is detected during the "sensing" interval. 4. The Simulation Model In this section we describe the simulation model used to study the performance of the architecture reviewed in section 2..

Reference-contexts: With this technique, caches are distributed over the network and store only a subset of video titles. Copy distribution to local caches depends on local user preferences. A copy may be removed after a given time interval due to request rate variations <ref> [LV95] </ref>. Video request rate varies for different titles (e.g., some titles are more popular than others, and new releases are more likely to be requested than "older" ones). For each new release, copies can be distributed during off-peak hours, anticipating a heavy user demand.

The same copy can be viewed by two or more users without the additional cost of remote access. Another advantage is better interactive control of the video stream by the user. The low latency allows the use of VCR controls without increasing network load. 3.

Reference-contexts: Hence, if the movie is available locally, the request for individual blocks are sent to the cache as well as to the IWHs. With the use of caching, the number of users serviced by a CO can significantly increase, at a much lower cost than replicating the IWH servers <ref> [SN95] </ref>. The actual number of user connections is limited by the available bandwidth and by the number of simultaneous users which can be served by the caches.

Reference-contexts: The study of such dynamic variations is also left for future research. Furthermore, whenever a user requests a movie, a determination is made as to whether it is a popular one, and hence whether it is stored in the cache. In <ref> [Tan96] </ref> it was shown that the probability that a movie i, out of a population of N movies ranked by decreasing popularity, is selected following the Zipf distribution: P Zipf (i) = 1 2 ++ 1 i In our experiments we considered different cache sizes: out of a population of N
