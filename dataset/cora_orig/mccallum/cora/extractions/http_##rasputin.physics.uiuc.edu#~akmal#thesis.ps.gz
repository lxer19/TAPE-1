Reference-contexts: However, the effect of the Coulomb pressure is balanced by surface tension in nuclei, and the experimental 0 is therefore believed to accurately characterize SNM. An additional property of symmetric nuclear matter is the incompressibility at saturation, which has been deduced from isoscalar breathing modes <ref> [5] </ref> and isotopic differences in charge densities of large nuclei [6] to have a value: K = k 2 @ 2 E F @ 2 j = 0 ' 220 30 MeV; where k F = (3 2 =2) 1=3 is the Fermi momentum of SNM.

Reference-contexts: In some expressions, this substitution is incorporated automatically via a degeneracy factor, s, which is 4 in SNM and 2 in PNM. 1.2 History of the nuclear many-body problem The earliest theoretical investigation of nuclear matter was carried out by Euler <ref> [7] </ref> in 1937, shortly after the introduction of the semi-empirical mass formula. At the time, very little was known about the nature of the nuclear interaction, and this early work was carried out using ordinary perturbation theory, assuming an interaction given by an attractive Gaussian well.

Reference-contexts: Also, many-body forces which are now believed to make important contributions at normal density cannot be easily incorporated into the Brueckner framework. At about the same time Brueckner theory was being developed, Jastrow <ref> [16] </ref> suggested a variational approach to the nuclear many body problem. Jastrow's variational wave function consisted of unperturbed wave functions multiplied by a product of two-body correlations.

Reference-contexts: The variational approach was pursued in the 1970s by 5 Pandharipande and Wiringa <ref> [17] </ref>, and a variational chain summation (VCS) approach, based on hypernetted chain-summation techniques, was developed to account for the many-body correlations expected to be important in dense nuclear matter. Subsequent calculations confirmed this expectation [18, 19]. <p> Renewed interest in the variational method in the 1970s led to the development of increasingly sophisticated trial wave functions, as proposed by Pandharipande [62] and by Pandharipande and Wiringa <ref> [17] </ref>. <p> However, for many-body systems such as nuclear matter, it can only be evaluated using approximate methods such as the variational chain summation (VCS) technique, which is described in detail in Ref. <ref> [17] </ref>. VCS involves summing selected terms in the cluster 31 expansion to infinite order in the number of particles via a set of integral equations known as the Fermi hypernetted chain (FHNC) and single operator chain (SOC) equations. <p> Pandharipande and Wiringa <ref> [17] </ref> show that: X E p = [A] + f [ A a ] [ A] [a]g + f [ A a b ] [ A a ][b ] [ A ][a b ] + [ A][a ][b ]g 1 [ b A a] [ b][ A a] + 2 z-|- <p> 3 r il ; (3.57) with 3 (i; j; l) = e i (k i r i +k j r j +k l r l ) ; (3.58) where C [ ] represents the so-called C-part, or the ; t -independent part of the operator product, as described in Reference <ref> [17] </ref>. Also, the O ij in the separated part of the expression do not operate on the f il O il . <p> The central chain diagrams shown in Figs. 3.1d-g make a modest contribution to the energy. The K-diagrams are obtained by inserting appropriate chain functions into the two-body integrals. Three central chain functions, G c xx 0 =dd;de;cc are defined in Reference <ref> [17] </ref>, where xx 0 denote the exchange character of the two interacting vertices of the diagram. Each of these may be either direct (x = d), exchanged only with particles in the chain (x = e) or part of a circular exchange involving both interacting particles (xx 0 = cc). <p> The latter integral is a so-called single-loop vertex correction, which is included in the more general vertex correction, M dd 1, to hv s ij i, defined in <ref> [17] </ref>. <p> contribution is: W RE k 2 8m 2 5 X Z ij A p 0 2 d 3 r ik (f ik ) (D pq + D mq + D p 0 q ) ; (3.88) where the K pmp 0 , A p and D pq matrices, defined in <ref> [17] </ref>, give the C-parts taking into account the non-commutativity of operators O p q The corresponding interacting exchange contribution is given by W RE 1 X Z ij 2 K npm 0 + K pmm 0 A m 0 Z q 2 1 D qm + 2 where the indices p;

Reference-contexts: Subsequent calculations confirmed this expectation [18, 19]. Friedman and Pandharipande <ref> [20] </ref> carried out detailed calculations of the equation of state for SNM and PNM using the VCS methods and the realistic Urbana v 14 interaction. <p> An alternative means of modeling many-body interactions in nuclear matter was proposed by Lagaris and Pandharipande [50], and used in Friedman and Pandharipande's calculation of the nuclear matter equation of state (EOS) <ref> [20] </ref>. The Urbana density-dependent interaction accounts for repulsive many-body forces by inserting a factor e fl 1 in the intermediate part of the Urbana v 14 NN interaction, thereby weakening the intermediate range attraction. <p> The location at which these curves intersect in each case is assumed to be the transition density. Also plotted for comparison in these figures are results for the A14+UVII, obtained by WFF [51], and the FP <ref> [20] </ref> results using the Urbana density-dependent (U-DDI) interaction. As evident in Fig. 5.2, a similar change in slope was predicted by WFF for PNM, which they interpreted as a transition to a pion-condensed phase. We shall present arguments for this identification in the following sections. <p> It is determined exclusively by the f functions, however. For an infinite, uniform fluid at T=0, t i / 5=3 i . The relationship between t i and i also depends on temperature, however. The variational calculations of Friedman and Pandharipande <ref> [20] </ref> were used to determine this relationship, and thereby the form of f (; x p = 0) and f (; x p = 0:5). The Fermi kinetic energy of neutron-proton matter is proportional to x 5=3 p + (1 x p ) 5=3 . <p> The greatest uncertainty comes from the repulsive component of the three-body force, which is treated too simply. The incorporation of relativistic boost corrections has put the predictions on firmer theoretical grounds, and reduced the corresponding uncertainty. The predictions of the Friedman and Pandharipande equation of state <ref> [20] </ref> are within the bounds of the present calculations. In light of present results, confidence in this often-used, though relatively crude calculation is justified. A troubling aspect of the neutron star calculations is the violation of causality which occurs at high densities.

Reference-contexts: Bethe estimated in 1953, that more effort had been expended on understanding the nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction in the previous two decades than on any other scientific problem in the history of humankind <ref> [21] </ref>. A fundamental description of the nuclear interaction should be based on the strong interaction between constituent quarks and gluons, which make up composite nucleons.

Model forces including central and tensor interactions were unable to explain the available scattering data, however.

Other examples of pre-1993 realistic potentials include the Paris [34] and Bonn <ref> [35, 36] </ref> models. The accuracy of realistic potentials depends crucially on the scattering data to which they are fitted. Unfortunately, some of the ~5000 elastic scattering data accumulated between 1955 and 1993 are of dubious quality.

Reference-contexts: The accuracy of realistic potentials depends crucially on the scattering data to which they are fitted.

The intermediate range interaction is presumably due to two-pion exchange processes.

Reference-contexts: More sophisticated models of V 23N , such as that developed by the Tucson-Melbourne group <ref> [49] </ref>, account for more general N scattering. The Tucson-Melbourne interaction is calculated with off-shell extrapolations of the N scattering amplitude. In that model, A 2 ~ 0:063 MeV, C 2 ~ 0:018 MeV, and B (r ij ; r ik ) is a nonzero function.

Reference-contexts: However, in doing so, the interaction exacerbates the overbinding and saturation of nuclear matter. It is therefore necessary to introduce a repulsive three-body force to correct for this. Lagaris and Pandharipande <ref> [50] </ref> argued that a spin-isospin-independent three-body potential could be written in the form: V ijk = l cyc where U l are strength parameters, u l (r) are functions of interparticle distance, and i is the angle between r ij and r ik . <p> We also note that the values of A 2 obtained from all these fits are close to ~ 0.03 MeV, the strength predicted by the Fujita-Miyazawa model. An alternative means of modeling many-body interactions in nuclear matter was proposed by Lagaris and Pandharipande <ref> [50] </ref>, and used in Friedman and Pandharipande's calculation of the nuclear matter equation of state (EOS) [20]. The Urbana density-dependent interaction accounts for repulsive many-body forces by inserting a factor e fl 1 in the intermediate part of the Urbana v 14 NN interaction, thereby weakening the intermediate range attraction. <p> The earlier calculation of hvi-MB-q by Lagaris <ref> [50] </ref> with the U14 potential included only the main term of this diagram, namely the term with only central correlations between interacting particles. While this approximation was justifiable for U14, the much stronger L 2 and (L S) 2 interactions of A18 require calculation of additional terms.

Reference-contexts: The parameters of Model VII, used by Wiringa Fiks and Fabrocini <ref> [51] </ref> (hereafter referred to as WFF), were determined from approximate variational calculations using the older Argonne v 14 NN interaction, and have the values: A 2 = 0:0333 MeV and U 0 = 0:0038 MeV. <p> The location at which these curves intersect in each case is assumed to be the transition density. Also plotted for comparison in these figures are results for the A14+UVII, obtained by WFF <ref> [51] </ref>, and the FP [20] results using the Urbana density-dependent (U-DDI) interaction. As evident in Fig. 5.2, a similar change in slope was predicted by WFF for PNM, which they interpreted as a transition to a pion-condensed phase. We shall present arguments for this identification in the following sections.

Reference-contexts: The insensitivity of these parameters to the details of the Urbana-Argonne models of v ij had been previously noted <ref> [52] </ref>. For example, calculations of 3 H and nuclear matter saturation density using Model VII yielded similar results with the Urbana v 14 and Argonne v 14 interactions, despite significant differences in the tensor components of those interactions.

Reference-contexts: In general, the interaction between two particles depends on their total momentum, and may be written as: v (P ij ) = v ij + ffiv (P ij ); (2.32) where v ij is the interaction for P ij = 0, and ffiv (P ij ) is the boost interaction <ref> [53] </ref> which is zero when P ij = 0. The relevance of this correction may be illustrated using a simple example. <p> The general validity of this equation in relativistic mechanics and field theory was recently discussed by Forest et al. <ref> [53] </ref>. Incorporating the boost into the interaction yields a nonrelativistic Hamiltonian of the form: H fl X p 2 2m X (v ij + ffiv (P ij )) + X ijk + ; (2.38) where the ellipsis denotes the three-body boost, and four and higher body interactions.

However, the two models predict somewhat different neutron star properties, as the contributions of ffiv and V R ijk have different density dependences.

For the maximum possible tensor correlations, 0;1;0 (r; = 0) is negligible compared to (2) 0;1;0 (r; = =2). <p> Both (2) (2) 0;1;M (r) are suppressed near r ~ 0 by the repulsive core in the NN interaction. 4.3 Quasi-deuterons in NM According to <ref> [69] </ref>, the (2) (2) 1;0;0 (r) have universal shapes in light nuclei at small r. In Figs. 4.2 and 4.3, we have scaled the densities in light nuclei such that their maximum 61 nuclei, scaled to the maximum value of the SNM distribution. <p> However, significant differences occur for r &gt; 2 fm. Note that the average interparticle distance in SNM at = 0:16 fm 3 is also ~ 2 fm. Forest et al. argue in <ref> [69] </ref> that the ratio, R Ad , of the maximum values of (2) nucleus A and the deuteron provides a good approximation to the Bethe-Levinger factor, L A , of the nucleus. The pion and photon absorption cross sections in light nuclei scale with R Ad .

Reference-contexts: In more quantitative terms, 0 -condensation is a long-range spin-isospin wave, or collective mode of the system. The connection between neutral pion condensation and long-range order has been discussed by many authors <ref> [70, 71, 72] </ref>. In PNM the spin structure in the pion-condensed state is that of an anti-ferromagnet (Fig. 5.5a). The corresponding structure in SNM is that of a neutron anti-ferromagnetic spin lattice superimposed on an equivalent proton lattice, as shown in Fig. 5.5b. <p> Thus, the i j ( i j t i t j ) interaction in PNM (SNM) plays a crucial role in onset of neutral pion condensation. These energetic considerations were formalized by Migdal <ref> [70] </ref>. In the Migdal approach, the local interaction between quasi-particles in the nuclear medium is expressed in terms of the phenomenological parameters f, f 0 , g and g 0 , representing the strengths of the central, isospin-isospin, spin-spin, and spin-spin isospin-isospin components, respectively. <p> HDP is canceled at lower densities by an increase in kinetic energy. 78 phase transition is inhibited in SNM for the two models with repulsive v t cores (U14 and A14), and in PNM for the U14 model, which has a repulsive ~v core. 79 5.4 Isovector Spin-Longitudinal Responses Migdal <ref> [70] </ref> calculated the isovector spin-longitudinal (IVSL) response of nuclear matter using effective interactions. <p> At q ~ 0 the IVSL response is almost entirely due to spin-isospin correlations, and E L (q ~ 0) is therefore large. In Migdal's picture <ref> [70] </ref>, the energy of the collective spin-isospin sound wave with q ~ 1:3 fm 3 decreases with increasing matter density, and pion condensation occurs when the energy vanishes.

Reference-contexts: Migdal assumed that this response would be dominated by a spin-isospin sound mode, and that the occurrence of transition would be indicated by the vanishing of the corresponding excitation energy. Calculation of the response of NM from realistic interactions is an extremely difficult task. However, it is well known <ref> [73] </ref> that the sums and energy-weighted sums of response functions are related to the two-body densities. <p> In SNM they are given by: S L (q) = 1 + 9 t 2 (r)j 2 (qr) d 3 r; (5.11) q 2 + 2 2 X D L (r) 2 (r) 5 d 3 r; (5.12) with the D p L (r) tabulated in ref <ref> [73] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: At the higher densities, results obtained for both the LDP and HDP are shown. At equilibrium density, the S L (q) exhibits a small enhancement in the q ~ 2 fm 1 region. Indications of an enhancement of the IVSL response have been observed in (~p; ~n) reactions <ref> [76] </ref>. In the LDP, this enhancement grows slowly with density. We predict a much larger enhancement at q ~ 1:3 fm 1 in the HDP.

Reference-contexts: In PNM, however, the difference in hv i is more pronounced between the LDP and the HDP. The difference in the expectation values of the pion number operator in matter and for A isolated nucleons is called the pion excess <ref> [77] </ref>. The operator for excess pions of momentum q, due exclusively to OPE interactions, is given by: ffin (1) (q) = q + q 2 The distribution of excess pions is given by: (q) = q + q 2 which is shown in Fig. 5.12 for SNM and PNM. <p> The ~(q) in the high density phase is enhanced relative to the low density phase, and is concentrated in the region q ~ 1:3 fm 1 . 86 two phases. 87 The total hffin i includes other contributions from the NN!N and NN! transition interactions <ref> [77] </ref>, which we have not calculated here.

Reference-contexts: It is in this context that we present our results for nuclear matter, and its consequences for neutron star structure. The earliest studies of neutron stars were carried out by Oppenheimer and Volkoff in 1939 <ref> [78] </ref>. Very little was known at that time about nuclear interactions, and these studies assumed a non-interacting neutron Fermi gas equation of state. Their calculations predicted an upper bound for neutron star mass of M = 0:7M fi . <p> The gravitational equilibrium of a spherically symmetric, non-rotating neutron star is described by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, in which the gravitational attraction in a general relativistic formulation is balanced by the pressure of matter <ref> [78, 87, 88] </ref>: dP (r) = r 2 (1 2Gm (r)=rc 2 ) where P (r) is the pressure at a distance r from the center of the star, ~(r) "=c is the gravitational mass density at that location, and m (r) = 0 ~(r 0 ) (6.16) is the gravitational

The results presented in this chapter are from a collaborative effort <ref> [79] </ref>, in which the author was one participant. 6.2 Equation of State for Beta-Stable Matter Predictions of neutron star structure require as input an equation of state for matter. We are mainly interested in the bulk properties of neutron stars, such as maximum mass, radii etc.

Reference-contexts: For densities up to ~ 0:1 fm 3 , we use the equation of state developed by Lorenz, Ravenhall 90 and Pethick <ref> [80] </ref>. For densities beyond that value, the equation of state is based on the variational calculations presented in previous chapters of this work. Results for neutron stars are presented for the four models previously described. <p> However, the general progression of the transition is believed to follow the path described in <ref> [80] </ref>. The transition through the structural phases (or "pasta phases") proceeds as follows. Between ~ :002 0 and 0.4 0 is the 3-D region, characterized by spherical drops of NPM in neutron gas. <p> Our equation of state for beta-stable bulk matter is applicable at this stage. For the matter found in the crust, ie: &lt; 0:6 0 , we use the EOS of Lorenz, Ravenhall and Pethick <ref> [80] </ref>. Fortunately, for typical neutron stars of M ~ 1:4M fi , the fraction of the star's mass contained in the crust is only ~ 2%. <p> The actual properties of stars may be reasonably expected to fall within these two limits, since the 3-body force is the single most important source of uncertainty in the Urbana-Argonne interaction. The stars predicted by Lorentz et al. <ref> [80] </ref> using the Urbana density-dependent interaction (labeled FPS in Fig. 6.4), fall within these limiting cases.

Reference-contexts: In order to extrapolate our results for E () in SNM and PNM to arbitrary proton fraction, x p = p =, we follow the prescription proposed by Lagaris and Pandharipande <ref> [81] </ref>. The energy at arbitrary x p may be expanded about x p = 0:5 (SNM), and contains terms with even powers of (x p 0:5). <p> In obtaining a fit to the energies of PNM and SNM, the restriction to simple power dependence on of typical Skyrme interactions was relaxed. The interpolation to arbitrary x p was carried out using the aforementioned result of Lagaris and Pandharipande <ref> [81] </ref>: g (; x p ) = g (; x p = 0:5)[1 (1 2x p ) 2 ] + g (; x p = 0)[1 2x p ] 2 : (6.14) The resulting fits to the variational results for SNM and PNM appear in Fig. 6.3.

Reference-contexts: The dashed curve at x p ~ 0:14 marks the onset of the direct Urca process in matter, which leads to fast cooling of stars via neutrino emission <ref> [82] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The possibility of deconfined quark matter in neutron star cores is certainly tantalizing. We are not at present in a position to make very accurate statements about such a possibility.

There is some uncertainty about the appropriate value for the bag constant, although generally accepted values lie in the B=100 to 200 Mev fm 3 range [103, 104].

There is some uncertainty about the appropriate value for the bag constant, although generally accepted values lie in the B=100 to 200 Mev fm 3 range <ref> [103, 104] </ref>. We assume the quark matter to be composed of u, d and s quarks. The u and d quarks are taken to be massless, and s quarks have a mass of 150 MeV.

Reference-contexts: There is no one-gluon exchange interaction energy between quarks of different flavor, while that between quarks of flavor i is given by (2ff=3)E i per quark i <ref> [105] </ref>. Here E i is the average kinetic energy per quark, and ff is the strong interaction coupling constant, assumed to have a value of 0.5.

Reference-contexts: A calculation using a wave function with built-in long-range order would provide more convincing evidence for the presence of a pion condensate in the HDP. Appropriate wave functions would be of a liquid-crystal type, such alternating spin layer (ASL) wave function of Takatsuka et al <ref> [107] </ref>, or correlated spin-ordered solid (SOS) wave function of Pandharipande and Smith [71]. 88 Chapter 6 Neutron Stars 6.1 Introduction The prediction of neutron star structure is a major application of the theory of nuclear matter and is one of the main reasons to study the subject. <p> This is a much more difficult task. Wave functions with liquid-crystal type long-range order do exists, however, they are not easily incorporated into a variational cluster calculation. Examples of such wave functions are the alternating spin layer (ASL) wave function proposed by Takatsuka et al <ref> [107] </ref> and the spin ordered solid (SOS) used by Pandharipande and Smith [71]. To date, only lowest order variational or lowest order Brueckner calculations have been possible with these wave functions.
