Title: MAGMA: An Agent-Based Virtual Market for Electronic Commerce

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an architecture for an agent-based virtual market that includes all elements required for simulating a real market. These elements include a communication infrastructure, mechanisms for storage and transfer of goods, banking and monetary transactions, and economic mechanisms for direct or brokered producer-consumer transactions. We report findings that resulted from implementing and conducting experiments with a free-market agent architecture (MAGMA). MAGMA is an extensible architecture that provides all services essential to agent-based commercial activities. These services are available through an open-standard messaging API, which allows using a heterogeneous set of agents, independently of the platform and language.

In addition, a robust communication infrastructure of processing electronic transactions must satisfy some basic security requirements <ref> [ Bhimani, 1996 ] </ref> , including user confidentiality (usually achieved through encryption), data integrity (data sent as part of a transaction should not be modifiable), message authentication (achieved by using digital signatures or certificates), and nonrepudiation (parties should not be able to deny their participation in a transaction after the fact).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Development of the Internet has spurred a number of attempts to create a virtual market place, where agents, both human-controlled and equipped with intelligent algorithms, can participate in trading of physical and electronic goods, as well as stocks and other investment vehicles <ref> [ Borenstein, 1996, Mullen and Wellman, 1996 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: Each player's strategy guides its actions at various steps in the game based on the available information. There are many considerations that come into play with automated bargaining agents engaged in bidding processes. If an unrestricted bidding protocol, such as the ones suggested in <ref> [ Chaterjee and Samuelson, 1988 ] </ref> , is employed, or if the transaction model used is an agent-based direct transaction model, then it may be difficult for any particular agent to determine the "fair" price for the transaction.

Reference-contexts: In addition, these systems generally lack facilities for automated purchasing and agent cooperation. Kasbah <ref> [ Chavez and Maes, 1996 ] </ref> is a Web-based system where users can create autonomous agents that buy and sell goods on their behalf. The system uses a classified ad 2 metaphor, where agents post their offers to the common blackboard and then lie dormant until there is a response. <p> Some examples of these include the Bargain Finder [ Krulwich, 1995 ] , FireFly [ Shardanand and Maes, 1995 ] , Infomaster [ Geddis et al., 1995 ] , Kasbah <ref> [ Chavez and Maes, 1996 ] </ref> , and ShopBot [ Doorenbos et al., 1996 ] . A generalized virtual market framework, however, needs to incorporate mechanisms to facilitate the investigation of market conditions and to assist users through a variety of decision algorithms.

Reference-contexts: These agents could also perform filtering or custom queries. Another approach was described by A. Keller <ref> [ Keller, 1995 ] </ref> . In this approach, a facilitator agent, armed with a knowledge base, acts as a broker, querying other advertising agents and databases for information requested by its client (which could be another software agent). <p> Given the open architecture of MAGMA, these extensions can be implemented adding specialized broker agents. Another possible direction is extending the Advertising Server to support virtual and smart catalogs such as those described by Keller <ref> [ Keller, 1995 ] </ref> , and creating Advertising Agents that would employ market mechanisms to place advertisements in a strategic manner. Advertising Agents could have different fee structures for their services.

Panurach <ref> [ Panurach, 1996 ] </ref> suggests several advantages of such an open standard for financial services: * users could choose among services provided by different financial intermediaries, forcing them to compete in the open market; * there would be fewer heterogeneous systems that need to be regulated, thus making the implementation of <p> the economic transaction models of electronic commerce and how they could be used effectively in the design of agent-based market systems. 7 3.1 Transaction Models for A Virtual Market Recently, there has been a substantial amount of effort devoted to the study and design of transaction models for electronic commerce <ref> [ Panurach, 1996 ] </ref> . Most of the proposed models have fallen under the following two general categories: 1. direct transactions among providers and consumers; 2. agent-based brokered transactions. 8 The direct transaction model has the advantage that purchases can be privately nego-tiated.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, the buying agent may also face a similar situation in trying to decide on an appropriate counter offer. A good example of this kind of situation is the telephone companies selling their long distance services to potential customers <ref> [ Rosenschein and Zlotkin, 1994 ] </ref> . A great deal of resources can be expended in back and forth negotiation or in strategies to obtain private information from buyers (e.g, their reservation price) by analyzing their bidding patterns, etc. <p> Below, we provide a brief description of the Vickrey mechanism.

Other bargaining protocols have also been suggested which involve different degrees of overhead in terms of strategic behavior.

Reference-contexts: It turns out that, in domains where the buying and selling of goods and services can be modelled by private-value auctions (i.e., where an agent's reservation price can be totally determined locally and is independent from other agents' reservation prices), the answer to this question is "yes." The Vickrey mechanism <ref> [ Vickrey, 1961 ] </ref> is one of such protocol which promotes truthful bidding among self-interested agents and thus avoids the need for counterspeculation. Below, we provide a brief description of the Vickrey mechanism.
