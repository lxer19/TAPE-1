Reference-contexts: The conditions on the minor iterates are similar to those used by Lescrenier [27].

From a computational viewpoint, an important difference is that each iteration of these algorithms requires the solution of a linear programming problem or a quadratic programming problem, while the trust region method requires the solution of systems of linear equations.

Reference-contexts: An advantage of this procedure is that it produces an acceptable ff k with a finite number of evaluations of k . For more details on this type of search, see Section 4 of More and Toraldo <ref> [36] </ref>. Given the Cauchy step s C k , we require that the step s k satisfy k (s k ) 0 k (s C + : (5:6) This requirement is quite natural and can always be satisfied by choosing s k = s C k . <p> This is precisely the same condition that we require for the computation of the Cauchy point. For additional details on projected searches, see Section 4 of More and Toraldo <ref> [36] </ref>. The process that we have outlined above can be repeated to generate a sequence of minor iterates z k;1 ; z k;2 ; : : : ; z k;l .
