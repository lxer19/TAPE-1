Title: Using RADIUS Site Models without the RCDE  
Author: Aaron J. Heller, Christopher I. Connolly, and Yvan G. Leclerc 
Address: 333 Ravenswood Ave., Menlo Park, CA 94025 USA  
Affiliation: Artificial Intelligence Center, SRI International

Abstract: We describe a system for converting RADIUS site models into a Web-accessible form. Once converted, the site models can be downloaded and viewed with standard, off-the-shelf Web browsers. Site models themselves are represented in the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML). Each feature in the site model is cross-linked to a Web page that describes that feature in more detail, including image chips and collateral information. A demonstration of work described in this paper is accessible via the URL http://www.ai.sri. com/connolly/pathfinder.

Reference-contexts: Over the next two to three years, between 20 and 30 VRML 1.0 browsers were developed for exchanging geometry over the Web. 1.3.2 Current status By August of 1996, a specification for VRML 2.0 was released <ref> [ Bell et al., 1996 ] </ref> . While VRML 1.0 is capable of representing static geometry, VRML 2.0 was aimed at augmenting geometry with time-varying behavior. Because of its increased complexity, only 4 browsers are known to exist for VRML 2.0, as of this writing.

Reference-contexts: As with most Web-related projects, the development of a VRML specification and prototype was rapid. A draft specification was released in fall of 1994. The format chosen for VRML was Silicon Graphics' ASCII Open Inventor format. A specification for VRML 1.0 was finalized and released on May 26, 1995 <ref> [ Pesce, 1995 ] </ref> . Not surprisingly, most of the initial work on VRML took place at Silicon Graphics.

Reference-contexts: Our current interest in VRML is a bit more pragmatic. While it is clearly not a replacement for richer scene description data models, such as the Synthetic Environment Data Representation and Interchange Specification (SEDRIS) <ref> [ The SEDRIS Team, 1996 ] </ref> now being developed by the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO), it is a simple and low-cost method to export geometric site-model data from the RCDE in a form that is suitable for dissemination via the WWW and usable with a wide variety of freely-available
