Title: The Impact of External Dependency in Genetic Programming Primitives  
Author: Una-May O'Reilly 
Address: Cambridge, USA  
Affiliation: Artificial Intelligence Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,  
Abstract: Both control and data dependencies among primitives impact the behavioural consistency of subprograms in genetic programming solutions. Behavioural consistency in turn impacts the ability of genetic programming to identify and promote appropriate subprograms. We present the results of modelling dependency through a parameterized problem in which a subprogram exhibits internal and external dependency levels that change as the subprogram is successively combined into larger subsolutions. We find that the key difference between non-existent and "full" external dependency is a longer time to solution identification and a lower likelihood of success as shown by increased difficulty in identifying and promoting correct subprograms.
