Title: Rational Nonmonotonic Reasoning

Abstract: Nonmonotonic reasoning is a pattern of reasoning that allows an agent to make and retract (tentative) conclusions from inconclusive evidence. This paper gives a possible-worlds interpretation of the nonmonotonic reasoning problem based on standard decision theory and the emerging probability logic. The system's central principle is that a tentative conclusion is a decision to make a bet, not an assertion of fact. The system is rational, and as sound as the proof theory of its underlying probability logic.

Reference-contexts: These two acceptance rules will be called modal. If the set of extensions is treated as the set of possible worlds in an S5 modal structure, Reiter's acceptance rule corresponds closely to the model operator (possibility) and circumscription's rule corresponds closely to the (necessity) operator <ref> (Dowty, Wall, and Peters, 1981) </ref>. Many systems forgo the modal approach by evaluating all sentences in a particular extension.

Reference-contexts: Many systems forgo the modal approach by evaluating all sentences in a particular extension.

Reference-contexts: First, from its defaults and knowledge it creates deductively-closed belief sets called extensions <ref> (Ginsberg, 1987) </ref>. In the Tweety example, with default and the knowledge that and , it creates the single extension . The second part of making conclusions is the application of an acceptance rule. The rule is a procedure that tells the nonmonotonic reasoner what conclusions to draw from the extensions. <p> Its approach may superficially appear less formal than approaches that invent a new formal system and provide proofs of its properties.

This approach may legitimately rely on others to develop the formal properties of the formal system.

Reference-contexts: The System 1/(1 + 1) = 0.5 P (gun_will_not_fire | 1_bullet_and_spun) 0.5 lim i = 1. 1 Though the exact meaning of the term rational is the subject of debate, most authors agree that a ratio nal agent maximizes its expected utility (Savage, 1954; Ferguson, 1967) and avoids Dutch books <ref> (Kyburg & Smokler 1964) </ref>. 2.2.2 The Need for Payoff and Probability The example shows that rational nonmonotonic systems must consider payoff and act accordingly. Systems that fail to consider payoff will in general miss opportunities (the first scenario) or suffer disastrous consequences (the second).

Reference-contexts: Now that the general scope of the desired nonmonotonic system is delimited, its particular properties are specified. 2 Desired Properties The desired properties of soundness and rationality are described and justified in turn. 2.1 Soundness One test of a nonmonotonic system's soundness is Kyburg's lottery paradox <ref> (Kyburg, 1970) </ref>. The paradox shows that nonmonotonic systems that allow chaining (that is, and introduction, modus ponens, and so on) across extensions (for example (Ginsberg, 1985; Yager, 1987)) are unsound; that is, they allow inconsistent conclusions. Kyburg's example was this: suppose there is a lottery with 10000 tickets.

Reference-contexts: Depending on the circumstances, it can be cautious like a circumscription system, brave like Reiter's system, or somewhere in between. Consideration of payoff is opposed by some. Pearl (1987) asserts that in day-to-day life the overhead of considering payoff overwhelms the benefit of such deliberations. Others disagree <ref> (Levi 1980) </ref>. In an idealized system there is no debate -- computation is free and optimal performance is expected -- so payoff must be considered. 3 Specification Given these desired properties, a description of a rational nonmonotonic system is now straightforward.

Reference-contexts: The nonmonotonic system is based on decision theory and probability. It is modal and does not allow chaining. 3.1 Probability The first step is the specification of a language, model theory, and semantics. One possibility is Nils-son's probabilistic logic <ref> (Nilsson, 1986) </ref>. The intuition behind probabilistic logic is that a particular sentence in a particular world/extension is either true or false. But, because agents do not know which world they are in, they must look at the set of worlds consistent with their knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Many systems forgo the modal approach by evaluating all sentences in a particular extension. The extension can be chosen arbitrarily (Doyle, 1983), according to some hierarchy of defaults (or priorities of circumscription (McCarthy, 1980; Lifschitz, 1987)), by choosing the most probable extension <ref> (Pearl, 1987) </ref>, or by some other method. In these pick-an-extension systems the truth value of a complex sentence is a function of the truth values of the literals that make up that sentence. This is not true in the modal systems.

Circumscription offers a different acceptance rule: it accepts a sentence if the sentence is true in every extension. Thus, circumscription makes no conclusion about and no conclusion about .
