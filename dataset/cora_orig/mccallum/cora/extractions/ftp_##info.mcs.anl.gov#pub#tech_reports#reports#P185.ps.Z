Abstract: A new iterative substructuring algorithm for three dimensions is proposed. It is shown that the condition number of the resulting preconditioned problem is bounded independently of the number of subdomains and that the growth is quadratic in the logarithm of the number of degrees of freedom associated with a subdomain. The condition number is also bounded independently of the jumps in the coefficients of the differential equation between subdomains. The new algorithm also has more potential parallelism than the iterative substructuring methods previously proposed for problems in three dimensions.

Reference-contexts: We assume shape regularity and that the substructures and elements satisfy the usual rules of finite element triangulations; see Ciarlet <ref> [4] </ref>. V H () and V h () are the spaces of continuous, piecewise linear functions, on the two triangulations, which vanish on 0 . Our work can be extended to other finite element models.

Reference-contexts: The wirebasket consists of all nodes that belong to the closure of more than two subdomains; see Fig. 1. It is then possible to design an interpolation procedure that is much less harmful. Other wirebasket-based algorithms have been suggested by Dryja <ref> [5] </ref> and Mandel [7], [8]. A problem with these algorithms is that they require the solution of the coarse wirebasket problem before the solution of the local problems can commence. With the vertex-based algorithms, all the problems can be solved simultaneously. <p> Then hjju h ffjj 2 l 2 (W i ) C (1 + log (H=h))ju h j 2 Here W i represents the wirebasket on substructure i : The wirebasket-based schemes of Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz [3] and Dryja <ref> [5] </ref> are based on calculating the average value of u h on i and then interpolating these values onto the faces of the individual substructures. <p> Then T (i) T X z F j (z @F j G (i) z @F j ) 1 z @F j G (i) : 4.2. The Previous Wirebasket Method. The original iterative substructuring wirebasket-based algorithm was proposed by Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz [3]. Dryja <ref> [5] </ref> adapted the same type of wirebasket-based coarse problem to a Neumann-Dirichlet algorithm. In [7] and [8] Mandel introduced a more general presentation and interpretation of the Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz algorithm, and we adopt this approach here. <p> In this section we prove the convergence properties of the new method and Mandel's method. We first give a series of lemmas needed, then state and prove our results. Many of the techniques are similar to those of Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz [3] and Dryja <ref> [5] </ref>. However, our algorithm is quite different, as is some of the analysis. We first use the approach of Section 3 to reduce the calculation of the condition number to that of a single subdomain. Lemma 5.1. <p> Lemma 5.2. In two dimensions jju h jj 2 H 1 () : Proof. See, e.g., Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz [2] or Dryja <ref> [5] </ref>. 2 In the rest of this section ae R 3 is a substructure of diameter H; and is its boundary. <p> Proofs of the first and second parts are given in Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz [3] and Dryja <ref> [5] </ref>, respectively. Lemma 5.3. <p> ju h F ij 2 00 (F i ) + ffi (H=h)hjju h jj 2 l 2 (W ) ): The bound follows from Lemma 5.7, Lemma 5.4, and Lemma 5.5. 2 This trick of scaling a portion of the preconditioner with ffi (H=h) has been previously used by Dryja <ref> [5] </ref> for a version of the Neumann-Dirichlet algorithm. We conclude by proving the result for the previous wirebasket method. Note that this is essentially the result in Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz [3]. Theorem 5.2.

Reference-contexts: The preconditioner is constructed in such a manner that the condition number is independent of the number of substructures and, very important, is also independent of the jumps in the coefficients of the differential equation between subdomains. We note that the additive Schwarz algorithms considered by Dryja and Widlund <ref> [6] </ref>, and Smith [9], [10], which use overlapping subdomains, converge very quickly for problems with slowly varying coefficients. However, their behavior for problems with large jumps in the coefficients is not fully understood. This paper is organized as follows. <p> Those with any given Dirichlet boundary data do not have a null space. Us--ing the above argument, we can conclude that the vertex-based method has a condition number that is bounded independently of the number of subdomains. Dryja and Widlund <ref> [6] </ref> have shown that, in two dimensions, the vertex-based method satisfies C (1 + log (H=h)) 2 : In three dimensions the bound is given by C (H=h)(1 + log (H=h)): Throughout this paper, c and C are constants, independent of h and H: These bounds are sharp.

With the vertex-based algorithms, all the problems can be solved simultaneously. <p> We propose and analyze a new wirebasket-based method, which has the same superior convergence properties as the previous algorithms, but with the added feature that the local problems and the coarse problem can be solved simultaneously. The new algorithm, like those of Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz [3] and Mandel <ref> [7] </ref>, [8], is an iterative substructuring algorithm. The preconditioner is constructed in such a manner that the condition number is independent of the number of substructures and, very important, is also independent of the jumps in the coefficients of the differential equation between subdomains. <p> In the next section, we introduce the elliptic and finite element problems. Section 3 contains a discussion of a vertex-based method that works well in two dimensions. Our new algorithm is introduced in Section 4 and is briefly contrasted with those of Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz [3] and Mandel <ref> [7] </ref>, [8]. Finally, in Section 5, we state and prove our theoretical results. 2. The Finite Element Problem. <p> This important idea is used in Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz [2], [3] and presented very clearly in Mandel <ref> [7] </ref>, [8]. This also makes it possible to show that the condition number is independent of the jumps in the coefficients between subdomains. <p> S S max C i ^ S; or equivalently ( ^ S 1 S) min i c i We note that this analysis will work if and only if null ( ^ S (i) ) = null (S (i) ); 8i: The observation above appears as a theorem in Mandel <ref> [7] </ref>. For scalar, second-order, elliptic problems without zero-order terms, the subdo-mains that have no given Dirichlet boundary data have a null space of the constant 6 functions. Those with any given Dirichlet boundary data do not have a null space. <p> This is not true of the methods considered by Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz [3] and Mandel <ref> [7] </ref>, [8]. To derive an explicit formula for T (i) , we need to introduce some more notation. <p> The Previous Wirebasket Method. The original iterative substructuring wirebasket-based algorithm was proposed by Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz [3]. Dryja [5] adapted the same type of wirebasket-based coarse problem to a Neumann-Dirichlet algorithm. In <ref> [7] </ref> and [8] Mandel introduced a more general presentation and interpretation of the Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz algorithm, and we adopt this approach here. Motivated by the desire to obtain condition numbers independent of the number of substructures, Mandel proposed the following preconditioner.
