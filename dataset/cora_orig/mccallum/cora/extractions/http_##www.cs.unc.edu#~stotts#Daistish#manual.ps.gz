Abstract: When daistish is applied to a set of axiom specification files, a C++ tester program is produced. When compiled and run, this program will test the adherence of an implementation of a data type against axia describing its characteristics. If the code is executed with a `-verbose' command line option, detailed reports are given for each axiom failure. created. If the filename has a `.c' suffix, the header file will have a `.h' suffix. Similarly will a `.C' file have a `.H' header, and a `.cc' file `.hh'. * -i &lt;include file&gt; | specifies a header file to include. Typically this
