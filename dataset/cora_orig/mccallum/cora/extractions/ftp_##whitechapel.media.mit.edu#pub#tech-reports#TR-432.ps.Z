Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 432 To Appear: IEEE ISWC proceedings Vol. 1, No. 1, October 1997 Abstract An "affective wearable" is a wearable system equipped with sensors and tools which enables recognition of its wearer's affective patterns. Affective patterns include expressions of emotion such as a joyful smile, an angry gesture, a strained voice or a change in autonomic nervous system activity such as accelerated heart rate or increasing skin conductivity. This paper describes new applications of affective wearables, and presents a prototype which gathers physiological signals and their annotations from its wearer. Results of preliminary experiments of its performance are reported for a user wearing four different sensors and engaging in several natural activities.

Reference-contexts: For example, we know when a human is highly aroused (as in a very shocking or surprising situation) that she is more likely to remember what is happening-the so-called "flash-bulb memory <ref> [BK77] </ref>." If the human brain is recording with full resolution at these times, then the wearable imaging system may not need to record more than a snapshot.

Reference-contexts: One of the big problems in emotion theory is determining what physiological patterns accompany each emotion (See, for example, <ref> [CT90] </ref>.) In some individuals, an increase in temperature and blood pressure might co-occur with anger. An acceleration in heart rate and pupillary dilation might indicate the person likes what he is looking at.

Reference-contexts: There is evidence to believe that physiological signals including accelerated heart rate [Lev92], raised blood pressure, increased skin conductivity, and constriction of the peripheral blood vessels [Hel78] are associated with stress in humans and heart rate variability [WPK84], pupillary dilation and right and left hemispheric activation in the brain <ref> [Dav93] </ref> are associated with like/dislike. We are experimenting to determine which physiological signals can be best monitored under ambulatory conditions to produce the most salient affective features with sensors that are comfortable to wear.

Reference-contexts: Affective states of depression, anxiety, and chronic anger have been shown to impede the work of the immune system, slowing down healing and making people more vulnerable to viral infections (See Chap 11 of <ref> [Gol95] </ref>.) Wear-ables provide a means of monitoring stress and other conditions outside the confines of a medical facility, gathering data as the wearer goes about his or her daily activities.

Reference-contexts: Affective wearables overlap with medical wearables in that both may sense physiological signals. In particular, both may be concerned with sensing signals that indicate stress or anxiety <ref> [HB96] </ref>, an application of interest not just for people suffering from anxiety attacks or other medical conditions, but also for healthy people who are interested in staying healthy.

Reference-contexts: The selection of which signals to measure is another challenge for an affective wearable. There is evidence to believe that physiological signals including accelerated heart rate [Lev92], raised blood pressure, increased skin conductivity, and constriction of the peripheral blood vessels <ref> [Hel78] </ref> are associated with stress in humans and heart rate variability [WPK84], pupillary dilation and right and left hemispheric activation in the brain [Dav93] are associated with like/dislike.

Reference-contexts: In a natural environment where weather, diet, and physical activity are present, the patterns corresponding to particular affective states are at a much greater risk of being obscured. We must identify and account for these confounding variables. In psychological studies by Lang <ref> [LGea93] </ref> and Win-ton, Putnam and Krauss [WPK84], subjects were monitored while looking at a series of photographs which were supposed to elicit an emotional response.

Reference-contexts: For example, instead of recording everything you hear, it might learn to record (or play back) just those places where your mind wandered. Augmenting a system like Steve Mann's WearCam <ref> [Man97] </ref> with affective sensing and pattern recognition could help it learn when to "remember" the video it collects, as opposed to always relying on the user to tell it what to remember or forget. Suppose for example that you let the camera roll while playing with a cute little baby.

Reference-contexts: Affective wearables provide a perfect opportunity to bring powerful computational methods to bear on testing emotion theories. 2 Applications of affective wearables There are dozens of applications of affective computing in addition to the medical and health applications mentioned above <ref> [Pic] </ref>.). For example, emotions are known to provide a keen index into human memory; therefore, a computer 1 that pays attention to your affective state will be better at understanding what you are likely to recall on your own.
