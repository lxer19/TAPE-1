Abstract: We present a system that lets 3-D models evolve over time, eventually produce novel models that are more desirable than initial models. The algorithm starts with some crude models given by the user, or randomly-generated models from a given model-grammar with generic design rules and loose constraints. The underlying philosophy here is to gradually evolve the initial models into better models over many generations. There is a close analog in the evolution of species where better-fit species gradually emerge and form specialized niches, a highly efficient process of complex structural and functional optimization. Our simulation results for model jet plane designs illustrate that our approach to model design and refinement is both feasible and effective.

Reference-contexts: Though still limited, GA, or genetic algorithms, has been applied successfully to a few vision and graphic applications, such as: segmentation of intensity images by Bhanu et al <ref> [Bhanu90] </ref>, and range images by Meygret et al [Meygret92], pattern recognition [Calloway87], and automatic generation of abstract color art [Sims91]. Especially, Hill et al [Hill92] applied GA to generate flexible 2-D templates for recognition of left ventricles in echocardiograms.

Reference-contexts: Goldberg's book <ref> [Goldberg89] </ref> and Koza's book [Koza92] are good references on GA and GP principles that we further extend: a.

Evolution processes have been shown to be more efficient than random search <ref> [Goldberg89] </ref>. With respect to genetic operations (crossover and mutation), each of our models has 2 levels: a aa Structural level: with a production grammar and symbolic parameters. A model design expressed at this level has the form of a tree, with no numerical values associated.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The motivations for our work are: a. Currently, some existing systems (e.g, <ref> [Ikeuchi88] </ref> and others) allow us to generate recognition strategies/programs, once we have an appropriate 3-D model of the target. A bottleneck in the development of these systems however, is the high costs of good model base design, indexing and coding. b. Real-world objects are very diverse.
