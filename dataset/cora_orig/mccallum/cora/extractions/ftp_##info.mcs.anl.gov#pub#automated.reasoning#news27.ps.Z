Abstract: Highlighted in this issue is an article by Li Dafa, who recently found a significantly shorter proof to the well-known halting problem. As many of you know, one of my favorite topics of research has been using an automated reasoning program to find shorter proofs. Not only are such proofs often more aesthetically pleasing, but they may have practical application, for example, in program synthesis. With his enhanced program ANDP, Dafa more than halved the previous automated proof of the problem (reducing the 93-step proof to 43 steps), coming remarkably close to the 38-step manual proof obtained by Burkholder in 1987. I encourage researchers to attempt to obtain (not by hand) an even shorter proof in resolution style|and to submit the results to the AAR Newsletter. A new journal, Multiple-Valued Logic, has been established and has issued a call for papers. The aim is to publish and disseminate knowledge internationally in the area of multiple-valued logic. Specific topics include mathematical aspects of MVL, engineering aspects of MVL, MVL and automated reasoning, computer science and MVL, theoretical and practical aspects of fuzzy logic, and philosophical aspects of MVL.

Reference-contexts: P1 & P2 & P3 & P4 -&gt; ~A1 CP 42 Appendix L. Burkholder presented the halting problem in <ref> [3] </ref> as the 76th automated theorem proving problem. This is an important theorem in computer science. We use (9x), (8x) to stand for existential quantifier and universal quantifier, respectively. Details about the English statement for the halting problem are given in [1,2], from which we take the following formulas.
