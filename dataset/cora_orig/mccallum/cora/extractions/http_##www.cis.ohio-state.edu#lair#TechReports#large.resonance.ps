Title: RESONANCE AND THE PERCEPTION OF MUSICAL METER  
Author: Edward W. Large John F. Kolen

Abstract: Many connectionist approaches to musical expectancy and music composition let the question of What next? overshadow the equally important question of When next?. One cannot escape the latter question, one of temporal structure, when considering the perception of musical meter. We view the perception of metrical structure as a dynamic process where the temporal organization of external musical events synchronizes, or entrains, a listeners internal processing mechanisms. This article introduces a novel connectionist unit, based upon a mathematical model of entrainment, capable of phase and frequency-locking to periodic components of incoming rhythmic patterns. Networks of these units can self-organize temporally structured responses to rhythmic patterns. The resulting network behavior embodies the perception of metrical structure. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of our approach for theories of metrical structure and musical expectancy.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we discuss existing approaches to modeling beat tracking, entrainment, and meter perception. 2.1 Music-theoretic perspective The term rhythm refers to the general sense of movement in time that characterizes our experience of music <ref> (Apel, 1972) </ref>. Rhythm often refers to the organization of events in time, such that they combine perceptually into groups or induce a sense of meter (Cooper & Meyer, 1960; Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983).

Reference-contexts: This approach does not assume that the beat-period is static, rather the length of a beat is adjusted throughout the performance as the performer speeds up or slows down. Results reported to date indicate that this task is surprisingly difficult <ref> (Allen & Dannenberg, 1989) </ref>. Longuet-Higgins and Lee (1982) have modelled the perception of meter as the parsing of inter-onset durations. Longuet-Higgins (1987) proposes a hybrid method that combines beat-tracking with metrical structure parsing.

Reference-contexts: Page (1993), in his proposal of an oscillatory connectionist network for tracking musical beats, recruits a relatively large network of traditional connectionist units into a neural implementation of a standard phase-locked loop. The heart of the network is a gated pacemaker circuit <ref> (Carpenter & Grossberg, 1983) </ref>. Page then implements a Type-II phase detector and a low-pass filter using networks of connectionist processing units, to provide an error signal that controls adjustments of phase and period in the gated pacemaker.

Reference-contexts: Once a sense of beat has been established, it continues in the mind of the listener, even after the supporting stimulus has ceased. The experience of beat is necessary for the experience of meter <ref> (Cooper & Meyer, 1960) </ref>. The term tempo refers to the rate (beats per unit time) at which beats occur. In this paper, we will generally refer to the reciprocal measure, the beat period, or the span of time between consecutive beats.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, these are the sorts of relationships that a model must capture in order to adequately model musical expectancy or music composition (P. Todd, 1991; Mozer, 1991). Second, recurrent networks generalize poorly to novel presentation rates, relying upon absolute rate information to recognize temporal patterns <ref> (Cottrell, Nguyen, & Tsung, 1993) </ref>. A network trained to recognize a 3 melody played at 80 beats per minute, for example, may not recognize the same melody played at 90 beats per minute.

Reference-contexts: A disadvantage of this approach is that it relies on a fixed input window, whose size may need to be adjusted depending on the input <ref> (Desain & Honing, 1991) </ref>. Recently Desain (1992) extended this approach to present a theory of complex temporal expectancy. An alternative approach to the problem of timing variability relies on a form of entrainment called beat-tracking (Allen & Dannenberg, 1989; Dannenberg, 1984; Dannenberg & Mont-Reynaud, 1987). <p> We have also demonstrated that entrainment provides a robust approach to the perception of meter in musical performance. This allows us to account for the perception of meter in the face of timing variability. Thus, the model embodies a dynamic solution to the quantization problem <ref> (Desain & Honing, 1991) </ref>. Finally, we demonstrated a system of oscillatory units correctly tracking two metrical levels in an improvised melodic performance. The rhythm of the improvised melody was complex, yet the simple system behaved quite reasonably.

Connectionist approaches often employ recurrent networks (Elman, 1990; Jordan, 1986; Port, 1990), trained to predict the next event of a sequence, given a memory of past events. Bharucha and P.

Some researchers have suggested that these results indicate perceptual synchronization of the listener to a perceived beat (e.g. Schulze, 1989; Yee, Holleran, & Jones, 1994).

Reference-contexts: According to this view, the brain may be treated as a special purpose device, capable of temporarily adapting its function to specific perception-action situations (Kelso & deGuzman, 1988). In perception, the nervous system may adapt endogenous modes of temporal organization to external rhythmic patterns, controlling attention and memory <ref> (Jones, 1976) </ref>. Other connectionists have noted the fundamental consonance of such dynamical systems approaches with modern connectionist cognitive modeling (e.g. van Gelder & Port, forthcoming). Ours is an attempt to bring the two closer together to overcome the limitations of current connectionist models.

Reference-contexts: Listeners are also better able to identify pitch changes in sequences when these changes occur at points of strong metrical accent <ref> (Jones, Boltz, & Kidd, 1982) </ref>. Additional evidence suggests that listeners implicit knowledge of meter (beyond immediate sensory context) contributes to the perception of temporal sequences.

Reference-contexts: Since time is the primary medium of musical communication, however, we cannot adequately characterize musical expectancy simply by considering what events a listener expects to occur. We must also take into account when a listener expects events to occur <ref> (Jones, 1981) </ref>. In this regard, we find it useful to distinguish between sequence processing and temporal processing. In sequence processing, a system must predict the sequential ordering of future events (What next?). Thus, a sequence processing system must collect, organize, and use knowledge of sequential structure. <p> These studies show that temporal pattern structure constrains the ability of subjects to attend to melodic sequences. For example, regularity of phenomenal accent placement has been shown to affect listeners abilities to judge the temporal order of tones in a sequence <ref> (Jones, Kidd, & Wetzel, 1981) </ref>. Listeners are also better able to identify pitch changes in sequences when these changes occur at points of strong metrical accent (Jones, Boltz, & Kidd, 1982).

Reference-contexts: For example, the discontinuity in the activation function constrains the oscillator to adjust its period only by speeding up (McAuley, 1994). We have proposed a continuous model (presented below, in a revised form) to avoid this problem, as well as the problems exhibited by phase-locked loop models <ref> (Large & Kolen, 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Lashley realized that the problem was not merely one of sequence processing. The temporal structure of human perception and action implies that the temporal structure of neural computation is extraordinarily complex <ref> (Lashley, 1951) </ref>. In this regard, the study of music is invaluable to the understanding of neural computation. Music, unlike natural language, forces us to deal with all aspects of time: time is so fundamental to music that it cannot be conveniently and convincingly abstracted away.

Reference-contexts: In music, a rhythm has an associated pattern of phenomenal accents, which 4 is the physical patterning of events in the musical stream such that some seem to be stressed relative to others <ref> (Lerdahl and Jackendoff, 1983) </ref>. Phenomenal accent can be conferred upon an event by the manipulation of many possible physical variables, including duration, pitch, and intensity. By beat, we mean one of a series of perceived pulses marking subjectively equal units in the temporal continuum. <p> Integer ratios usually characterize the beat period relationship (2:1 or 3:1 for example), so that meter is said to describe a nested grouping of beats <ref> (Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983) </ref>. Meterical organization usually exists on multiple time scales (Cooper & Meyer, 1960; Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983). Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983) have proposed a construct that describes the temporal organization of a piece at all relevant metrical levels, called a metrical structure. <p> A metrical structure describes one of the most important subjective components of rhythmic experience: the feeling of regularly recurring strong and weak beats called metrical accent <ref> (Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983) </ref>. Points of metrical accent are captured, using a metrical grid, as temporal locations where the beats of many levels coincide. <p> Although phenomenal accent information may be missing or ambiguous, moments of musical stress in the raw signal are thought to serve as cues from which the listener may extrapolate a regular pattern of metrical accents <ref> (Lerdahl & Jackendoff, 1983) </ref>. Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983) have proposed a generative theory for the perception of metrical structure that is expressed as two sets of rules. A set of well-formedness rules describes legal metrical structure hierarchies.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Embodied musical meaning is, in short, a product of expectation. ... If this hypothesis is correct, then an analysis of the process of expectation is clearly a prerequisite for the understanding of how musical meaning, whether affective or aesthetic, arises in any par ticular instance. <ref> (Meyer, 1956) </ref> Meyer proposed that expectation is the key to understanding human intellectual and emotional response to music. Through artful patterning of the acoustic environment, composers and performers evoke expectations in their listeners. They skillfully manipulate these expectations, satisfying some and frustrating others, to arouse both affective and intellectual responses.

Reference-contexts: Pitch structures that coincided with temporal structures enhanced recall, while pitch structures that conflicted with temporal structures negatively affected recall (Deutsch, 1980). In a related finding, memory confusions of temporal patterns in a discrimination task were found to be consistent with a music-theoretic metrical structure hierarchy <ref> (Palmer & Krumhansl, 1990) </ref>. Other studies have demonstrated similar memory constraints, by showing that the reproducibility of rhythms is affected by the patterns of phenomenal accentuation in the to-be-reproduced rhythm. <p> Additional evidence suggests that listeners implicit knowledge of meter (beyond immediate sensory context) contributes to the perception of temporal sequences. Listeners goodness-of-fit judgements for events presented in metrical contexts were shown to be consistent with multi-leveled metrical structure hierarchies <ref> (Palmer & Krumhansl, 1990) </ref>. 7 Another source of evidence for the temporal expectancy hypothesis comes from psychophysical studies of time perception. It appears that the temporal structure of auditory patterns actually affects humans abilities to perceive time.

Reference-contexts: The Farey tree enumerates all rational ratios according to the stability of the corresponding mode lock in the coupled system. Its branching structure corresponds the structure of the Arnold tongues of the sine circle map, as well as to known bifurcation routes in other mathematical and natural systems <ref> (Schroeder, 1991) </ref>. p q oscillators may be summarized in a regime diagram. The parameter regions that correspond to mode-locked states are known as Arnold tongues (shaded). The width of each resonance tongue reects the stability of the corresponding mode lock.

Reference-contexts: Figure 3A shows a regime diagram for the sine circle map. The x-axis is the bare winding number, , and the y-axis is coupling strength, . The regime diagram identifies stable phase-locked states, also called attractors, mode locks, or resonances <ref> (Treffner & Turvey, 1993) </ref>, for particular coupling strengths and driven/driver period ratios. The parameter regions that correspond to stable phase-locked states are known as Arnold tongues (Glass & Mackey, 1988; Schroeder, 1991).

Reference-contexts: Consider that synchronization behavior has been proposed by other connectionist modelers to explain how the brain solves problems of binding. Often, a network of two units produces the oscillatory behavior of interest, and synchronization arises given simple couplings <ref> (e.g. Wang, 1993) </ref>. Such proposals have received considerable physiological support, especially since the discovery of oscillations and synchronization in the cat visual cortex (Eckhorn et al. 1989; Gray et al. 1989).

Reference-contexts: Adherence to Webers law breaks down under certain circumstances, however. Temporal difference judgements improve as the number of reference intervals increases (Schulze, 1989; Drake & Botte, 1993). It has also been shown that sensitivity to time changes in sequences is best for metrically regular sequences <ref> (Yee, Holleran, & Jones, 1994) </ref>, and that sensitivity to tempo changes degrades with the regularity of the stimulus (Drake & Botte, 1993). Some researchers have suggested that these results indicate perceptual synchronization of the listener to a perceived beat (e.g. Schulze, 1989; Yee, Holleran, & Jones, 1994).
