Note: Notes on the First International Conference on Information and Computation Economies  
Abstract: The First International Conference on Information and Computation economies (ICE98) was primarily sponsored by IBM Institute for Advance Commerce, and co-sponsored by the ACM. It took place in Charleston, South Carolina from the 25th till the 28th of October 1998. Economists, computer scientists and engineers came together in an attempt to present ongoing research in a potentially new field emerging from the convergence of the two areas. This is an overview and comments on the talks and the papers presented the interested reader is referred to the coference proceedings. This paper reflects only the views of the author, some papers are described in more detail and the summaries are based on notes taken during the sessions but also on the abstracts and results.
