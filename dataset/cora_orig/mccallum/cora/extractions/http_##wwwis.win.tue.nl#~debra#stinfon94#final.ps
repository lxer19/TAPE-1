Title: Retrieval of Hypertext Structures

Abstract: This paper reflects research on the retrieval of structural information in distributed hypertexts, like the World-Wide Web (WWW). A complete overview of the structure of such hypertexts is not available and cannot be easily obtained because of the discrepancy between the large size of the hypertext and the relatively low bandwidth of the network. Retrieving both structural and content information in such hypertexts can only be done by browsing (also called navigation). We concentrate on retrieving information on the structure of a hypertext. This structure embodies part of the semantics of the hypertext. These semantics are important for the readers because their perception of the hypertext's structure is essential for finding their way through the hyperspace without getting lost. The retrieval of information, both content and structure, from a hypertext is mainly influenced by three factors : the browsing strategy followed by the reader, the browsing facilities offered by the hypertext system, and the hypertext's structure. In this paper a number of experiments are described that investigate the relationship between browsing strategies, browsing facilities, and the reader's discovery of the hypertext structure. With these experiments we aim at obtaining a better insight into the relationship between a given hypertext's structure and the reader's perception of that given structure. The results from these experiments are also used in practice: based on the results we have optimized the fish-search facility for the WWW browser Mosaic. Although this search algorithm performs content search, not structure search, the results from the experiments have provided an optimal navigation strategy for the fish-search.

Reference-contexts: One network-like structure with 57 nodes and 225 links, a strictly hierarchical structure with 81 nodes and 80 links, and a combination of the two. * Finally, the structure of the book by Shneiderman and Kearsley [7] was used, with its reference and index nodes removed, as suggested in <ref> [1] </ref>. We call this structure HHO. It has 238 nodes and 867 links. 3.2 Strategies For each of these graphs all combinations of the different strategies and facilities have been used, with different settings of the configurable parameters. <p> In the experiments we use three metrics on structures, borrowed from <ref> [1] </ref>. For these metrics links are divided in structural (hierarchical) links and cross-reference links. The basic idea is that from the point of view of the reader a hyperdocument appears to have a hierarchical structure which is disturbed by some cross-reference links.

Reference-contexts: More details can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. Table 2 shows some of the results concerning the HHO-graph. The numbers in this table resemble the metric-values of the subgraph that is searched during a browsing-session performed by a simulated user.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, we have simulated what the user learns about the structure : the user's current perception of the structure. The number of steps used in the simulated browsing sessions is based on the weights assigned to the different steps, and they are related to results from <ref> [3] </ref> about the number of steps needed by real users for either just browsing a hyperdocument or for searching for a specific piece of information.

Reference-contexts: In order to help users obtain a proper perception of a hypertext's structure, different approaches can be followed. For smaller hypertexts a valid approach is to show to the readers a graphical overview of the hypertext's structure <ref> [4, 11, 10, 5] </ref>. By observing this overview the users would be able to better understand how the information in the hypertext is linked together. Larger, distributed hypertexts like the World-Wide Web (WWW) have parts that are only loosely coupled (somewhat like heterogeneous multidatabase systems).

Reference-contexts: This facility is usually combined with a facility that gives the reader some information on the node a link leads to, thus supplying valuable information on the hyperdocument's structure. (Hyperties <ref> [6] </ref> and Mosaic offer such a facility, among others.) * The history list facility gives a list of all nodes visited before.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Hypertext can be defined (somewhat like in <ref> [7] </ref>) as a database of (textual) information fragments (nodes) that has active cross-references (links) and allows the reader to jump to other parts of the database as desired. <p> One network-like structure with 57 nodes and 225 links, a strictly hierarchical structure with 81 nodes and 80 links, and a combination of the two. * Finally, the structure of the book by Shneiderman and Kearsley <ref> [7] </ref> was used, with its reference and index nodes removed, as suggested in [1].
