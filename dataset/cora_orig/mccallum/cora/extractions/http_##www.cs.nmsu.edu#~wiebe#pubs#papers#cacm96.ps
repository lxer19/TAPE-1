Reference-contexts: The trains project, led by Allen and Schubert <ref> [1] </ref>, also embraces the collaborative nature of discourse. The project's aim is to build a system that acts as a planning assistant, collaborating with the user to help formulate plans that will meet their goals.

Reference-contexts: If there is only one tree that the speaker could possibly be referring to, detailed descriptions such as (15.4-6) are misleading, as they spuriously imply that some kind of contrast is being made. Dale <ref> [2] </ref> and Reiter [21] have developed methods for constructing referring expressions. The first consideration is whether a pronominal reference is possible; if not, a definite noun phrase must be constructed.

Reference-contexts: For example, in Dale's system, a syntactic structure is chosen at random to express the content of the description; e.g., either the pitted olives or the olives that have been pitted. But, as Hovy's work showed, form is just as important. DiMarco and Hirst <ref> [3] </ref> sought to correlate a writer's use of various syntactic constructions with his or her higher-level stylistic goals, with a view to ensuring that an automatic translation retains these goals even if that requires a different syntactic structure in the target language.

Reference-contexts: If the result is either no interpretation at all or several possible interpretations from which a choice cannot be made, the hearer can then ask for clarification, can remain silent (hoping that subsequent utterances will resolve matters), or can invoke additional processing to try to recover. Eller and Carberry <ref> [4] </ref> take the third approach; the interpretation of an utterance that cannot be coherently integrated into the current context is relaxed by a set of heuristics. Relaxation permits the system to consider a somewhat unlikely shift of focus, for instance, or an imprecise use of tense.

Reference-contexts: Collaboration in discourse Although the work on explanation just described takes the hearer into account in some ways, discourse is fundamentally collaborative in more ways than these. "The participants in a discourse work together to satisfy various of their individual and joint needs" <ref> [5, page 418] </ref>. Most early work on inferring the intentional structure behind discourse did not consider this. <p> Some recent work on plan inference has attempted to embrace these important facets of real discourse. If one wishes to model situations in which agents share joint plans, one must ask what it means for two agents to have a joint plan to do something. Grosz and Sidner <ref> [5] </ref> are concerned with precisely this question. They extend Pollack's earlier definition of having a plan [20], which was designed only for single-agent plans, to the case of joint plans.

Reference-contexts: The problem is somewhat different in interactive discourse because, if a referring expression fails to pick out a unique entity, the participants can immediately try to correct it; that is, they can collaborate on the task of reaching a common understanding of the reference. Heeman and Hirst <ref> [6] </ref> have modeled this computationally as the construction and recognition, by two agents with possibly differing beliefs, of plans to refer to something.

Reference-contexts: The details given in (1.3-5) serve this purpose of the author. There is evidence that people do perform this kind of segmentation of discourse during understanding. For example, Passonneau and Litman [19] and Hirschberg and Grosz <ref> [7] </ref> found 1 Eric S. Roberts, The Art and Science of C: A Library-Based Introduction to Computer Science, Addison Wesley, 1995, page xv. 3 statistically significant agreement among subjects who were asked to perform a discourse--segmentation task.

Reference-contexts: Another important kind of indication is cue phrases, such as anyway, however, well, still, for example, and now, which often provide explicit information about the structure of a discourse. For example, now can be used to introduce a new subtopic <ref> [8] </ref>. But many words that serve as cue phrases also have other uses|for example, now can simply mean `at this time'. To see how these ambiguities could be resolved, Hirschberg and Litman [8] studied cue-phrase usage in speech, and developed a method for disambiguating cue phrases by means of intonational features <p> For example, now can be used to introduce a new subtopic <ref> [8] </ref>.

To see how these ambiguities could be resolved, Hirschberg and Litman [8] studied cue-phrase usage in speech, and developed a method for disambiguating cue phrases by means of intonational features of speech. They also discovered textual features of transcribed speech, such as punctuation, that are relatively easy to extract from transcriptions and can be used as additional aids in cue-phrase disambiguation.

Reference-contexts: Their approach formalizes the intuitive notion that the sentences in a paragraph all are related in some way to the same topic.

Reference-contexts: Relationships within discourse segments We now turn to some recent work that investigates the structure within discourse segments. Hobbs et al. <ref> [10] </ref> and others have suggested that during understanding, people make de-feasible assumptions, that is, assumptions that are consistent with what they believe, but which can be later overridden by contrary evidence. Such assumptions lead them to a plausible, coherent interpretation of the discourse. <p> that both parts of the problem can be accounted for in a model of conversation in which the interpretation of an utterance is characterized as abductive reasoning (e.g., given Q and P ) Q, guess that P is also true) and the generation of an utterance as default reasoning (see <ref> [10] </ref> and above). In this model, conversants abductively form defeasible expectations as to what kind of utterance is likely to occur next in the conversation, and use these expectations to monitor for differences in understanding.

Reference-contexts: One might choose material that supports one's own position or that might appeal to the listener, while omitting material that undermines one's position or that might annoy a listener whom one doesn't wish to offend. Hovy's natural-language generation system pauline <ref> [11] </ref> was the first to account, in an integrated manner, for inter-personal concerns in linguistic nuance and in the selection of material. Although pauline was impressive, it had no theoretical basis; it employed a wide variety of rules that were little more than an ad hoc collection of heuristics.

Reference-contexts: Their mechanism is also sensitive to the linguistic context; one could imagine a context for (5) in which it is taken to mean that John fell and then Max pushed him. In this case, the relation is narration after all. Hwang and Schubert <ref> [12] </ref> focus on interpreting tense to create a representation of the temporal relations among events described in the discourse, including implicit temporal relations across clause and sentence boundaries. To get an idea of what sorts of relations are recognized, consider (6) (from [12]): (6) 1. <p> Hwang and Schubert <ref> [12] </ref> focus on interpreting tense to create a representation of the temporal relations among events described in the discourse, including implicit temporal relations across clause and sentence boundaries.

Association for Computational Linguistics, N.J., </institution> <year> 1993, </year> <pages> pp. 70-77. </pages>
Reference-contexts: Hwang and Schubert's mechanism also works for longer narrative, provided that tense is used "literally". Consider the following modified version of an example given in <ref> [13] </ref>. (The notation t e refers to the time of event e.) 5 (7) 1. John went over to Mary's house. [t goOver ] 2. On the way, he had stopped by the flower shop for some roses. [t stop ] 3. <p> Thus, as Hwang and Schubert and others discuss, tense alone is not sufficient in such cases to determine the temporal relations among events. Kameyama, Passonneau, and Poesio <ref> [13] </ref> take up this problem. Their approach is based on the idea, proposed by Webber [23] among others, that determining the time that a past tense refers to is similar to determining which entity a pronoun refers to, in that they both depend on things mentioned in the previous discourse. <p> He rode off into the sunset. [t rideOff ] In Kameyama et al.'s terminology, a past tense is understood with respect to a discourse reference time, which is established by the linguistic context. For the second sentence, the discourse reference time is t getOn . Now consider (10) (from <ref> [13] </ref>), where (10.3a) and (10.3b) are two alternative continuations: (10) 1. John went over to Mary's house. [t goOver ] 2. On the way, he had stopped by the flower shop for some roses. [t stop ] 6 3a.

Reference-contexts: The difficult question still remains: how do the agents acquire the intentions and very strong mutual beliefs required to have a shared plan? This is the problem that Lochbaum, Grosz, and Sidner <ref> [15] </ref> tackle. First, however, they modify the definition in two important ways.

Reference-contexts: Most theories of discourse include both intentional and rhetorical knowledge to some extent. Moore and Paris focus on explicitly representing and using both kinds during processing. The rhetorical knowledge in the system, which is based on Mann and Thompson's Rhetorical Structure Theory <ref> [16] </ref>, consists of strategies for achieving communicative goals by means of establishing rhetorical links between discourse segments.

Reference-contexts: In such cases, they often ask follow-up questions.

User: 2. Readability and maintainability. System: 3. You should replace (SETQ X 1) with (SETF X 1). 4. SETQ can only be used to assign a value to a simple-variable. 5.

Reference-contexts: And speech recognition systems can use intonational features and cue phrases (and perhaps also textual features, if the speech has been transcribed) to help perform segmentation and infer relationships between segments. In fact, AT&T Bell Laboratories' Text-to-Speech System <ref> [22] </ref>, based on Hirschberg and Litman's work, does both; it disambiguates cue phrases in text on the basis of textual features, and then generates cue phrases in such a way that the intonational features suggest how the cue phrases are being used.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we have the problem of segmenting text according to whose beliefs, intentions, and so forth are being presented, a problem made difficult by such implicitly presented mental states. Wiebe <ref> [24] </ref> developed an algorithm for performing this segmentation in third-person narrative texts. The algorithm is based on regularities, found by extensive examination of naturally occurring text, in the ways that writers manipulate point of view.
