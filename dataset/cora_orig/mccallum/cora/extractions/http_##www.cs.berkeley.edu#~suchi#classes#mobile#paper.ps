Title: A Study of Short-Term Fairness in Wireless MAC Protocols  
Author: Andrew Swan and Suchitra Raman 
Date: May 11, 1998  
Abstract: In this paper, we study short-term fairness in distributed, contention-based wireless medium access control (MAC) protocols. While most MAC protocols provide fairness among contending stations in the long term, they are not fair over shorter time scales. We first demonstrate short-term unfairness of CSMA/CA using packet-level traces collected from an in-bulding wireless LAN network. We also analyze these traces and show adverse interactions between TCP and CSMA/CA. We then model the system of contending stations as a Markov chain and define the short-term fairness index for this model as the zeroth-order entropy rate of the underlying stochastic process. We argue that because this quantity is a good measure of uncertainty in channel accesses, it models short-term fairness well. We solve the analytical model for a CSMA/CA-based system with different numbers of stations and conclude that its short-term fairness is significantly lower than ideal.

While such mechanisms are often considered part of a MAC protocol, they are orthogonal to the study of fairness.

Reference-contexts: This adverse interaction causes the "pipe" to remain under-utilized resulting in low TCP throughputs. In fact, the smooth ACK-clocked TCP protocol degenerates to a window-by-window stop and wait protocol. A similar effect was also reported in 3 long durations in which one host does not gain access. CSMA/CD-based Ethernets <ref> [10] </ref>. In summary, while CSMA/CA is asymptotically fair, it is unfair over short time scales. This short-term unfairness leads to undesirable effects in feedback-based protocols such as TCP. While good metrics (e.g., min-max fairness index) exist to quantify long-term fairness, there is no quantitative metric for short-term fairness.
