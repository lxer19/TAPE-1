Abstract: We wish to navigate across complicated three-dimensional structures. We describe a robot that can propel itself on a web of surfaces oriented around arbitrary directions in three-space. This robot is an inchworm-like robot with a simple, modular, and flexible design. We present control algorithms for the task-level skills that allow the robot to walk vertically, horizontally, and inverted, and the algorithms that allow the robot to make transitions between surfaces. Finally, we discuss our experiments.

Reference-contexts: In designing this robot we drew inspiration from biology. We studied the motions of inchworms. Inchworms (also called loopers) move with a looping movement in which the anterior legs and posterior prolegs are alternately made fast and released <ref> [Opl94] </ref>. The strong grip allows inchworms to attach themselves to arbitrarily oriented objects. The alternation of fastening enables a propelling motion. This simple strategy gives inchworms the mobility to move stably on arbitrarily oriented surfaces.
