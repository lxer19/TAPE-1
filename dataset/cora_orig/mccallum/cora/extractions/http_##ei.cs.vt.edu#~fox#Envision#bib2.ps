Title: The Bipartite Model for Bibliographic References  
Author: Dennis J. Brueni Bailey T. Cross 
Date: March 19, 1993  
Abstract: A model for bibliographic markup based on a bipartite graph is presented along with an overview of an SGML DTD adhering to the model. This model is contrasted with the traditional linear, record-based model for bibliographic markup. This paper assumes a working knowledge of SGML.

Reference-contexts: Table 1 shows the adjacency matrix for the bipartite graph formed by the Envision bibliographic DTD. A more complete description of the Envision bibliographic DTD, as well as its supporting substructure and superstructure can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. In addition to the components shown in Table 1, the following types of code numbers are optional in all document types. * ISSN number; * ISBN number; * CODEN number; and * Library of Congress Number.

Each component in B refer is identified by a single letter following a percent sign, as in Figure 2.
