Groupkit [5] and Turbo Turtle [3], in particular, use telepointers and other awareness widgets to indicate to others where a user is working in the system.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a computer system which supports CCOs must provide input devices that are each controlled by a different user. The components or properties of a CCO may be manipulated using general methods, such as constraints between user inputs and application objects. Fine-grain sharing, studied by Shen <ref> [6] </ref>, is one method to implement an object shared in terms of its parts such that each part may be controlled by a different user.
