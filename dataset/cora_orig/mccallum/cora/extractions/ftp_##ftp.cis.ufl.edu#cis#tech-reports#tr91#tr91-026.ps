Abstract: University of Minnesota University of Florida Abstract We develop fast polynomial time algorithms to optimally fold stacked bit sliced architectures to minimize area subject to height or width constraints. These algorithms may also be applied to folding problems that arise in standard cell and sea-of-gates designs.

Reference-contexts: If not, additional space proportional to the number of wires between i 1 and i 1 +1 must be reserved (Figure 2). We consider both of these cases in this paper. The bit sliced model defined above was introduced by Larmore, Gajski, and Wu <ref> [LARM90] </ref> for the compilation of arbitrary net lists into layout for CMOS technology. They studied various folding strategies under the assumtion that components may be reordered and the stack can be folded only once (so, only a two stack configuration as in Figure 1 (b) is possible). <p> The overall complexity is O (n 2 logn). 6. Conclusions We have considered the problem of folding bit sliced stacks so as to obtain minimum height (subject to width constraints) and minimum width (subject to height constraints) foldings. Our model differs from that of <ref> [LARM90] </ref> in that we do not permit a reordering of the components in the input component stack. Our model applies to bit sliced architectures as well as to standard cell and sea-of-gates designs.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction A stack of bit sliced components ([LARM90] and <ref> [WU90] </ref>) consists of n components of varying height and width with their left ends vertically aligned as in Figure 1 (a). <p> C i 3 +1 C i 2 +1 C i 1 +1 C 1 stack 4stack 3stack 2stack 1 (c) Folded into 4 stacks 4 C 1 C n inter stack routing width, in number of slices, of component i). In <ref> [Wu90] </ref>, Wu and Gajski report on the application of their two stack folding model to real circuits. In this paper, we place no restriction on the number of folding points i 1 , i 2 , ... , i k . Additionally, we do not permit component reordering.

Reference-contexts: Note that our model can also be used for the folding step of placement algorithms for standard cell and sea-of-gates designs <ref> [SHRA88, SHRA90] </ref>. In this, the modules to be placed have been ordered by some criterion and are then folded into the layout area so as to minimize area.
