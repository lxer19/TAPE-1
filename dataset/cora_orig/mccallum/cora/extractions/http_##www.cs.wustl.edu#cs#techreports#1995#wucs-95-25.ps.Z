Reference-contexts: These include building mobility support into the Internet Protocol (IP) [4, 5] and distributed operating systems issues such as memory and file management [7, 9]. At the applications level, researchers are attempting to predict what new kinds of applications will be demanded by users of mobile computing <ref> [1, 10] </ref> and are trying to produce new design practices and methodologies to meet the software engineering challenges brought on by mobile computing [2, 8]. A key question is how to produce mobile-aware applications quickly and dependably.

Our hope is that the right abstractions, coupled with pragmatically-minded formal treatment of problems, can help the developer meet these requirements. Our reasearch goal is to understand the fundamental issues facing mobile computing and to develop practical design solutions for the flexible and rapid deployment of mobile applications.

Reference-contexts: There are about half a dozen models of concurrency that might be considered to meet these requriements. We favor UNITY <ref> [3] </ref>, a model originally proposed by Chandy and Misra. The UNITY programming notation reduces distributed computing to a very small number of constructs: conditional multiple-assignment to shared variables and weakly-fair statement selection.

Reference-contexts: These and related issues define the main themes of this position paper. Much mobile computing research has been focused on relatively narrow issues. These include building mobility support into the Internet Protocol (IP) <ref> [4, 5] </ref> and distributed operating systems issues such as memory and file management [7, 9].
