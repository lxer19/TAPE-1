Abstract: We provide an analysis of a recent path planning method which uses probabilistic roadmaps. This method has proven very successful in practice, but the theoretical understanding of its performance is still limited. Assuming that a path fl exists between two configurations a and b of the robot, we study the dependence of the failure probability to connect a and b on (i) the length of fl, (ii) the distance function of fl from the obstacles, and (iii) the number of nodes N of the probabilistic roadmap constructed. Importantly, our results do not depend strongly on local irregularities of the configuration space, as was the case with previous analysis. These results are illustrated with a simple but illuminating example. In this example, we provide estimates for N , the principal parameter of the method, in order to achieve failure probability within prescribed bounds. We also compare, through this example, the different approaches to the analysis of the planning method.

Reference-contexts: Several recent papers describe practical path planners that can deal with robots that have more than 4 degrees of freedom (dof) and move in realistic environments (for a survey see <ref> [3, 7] </ref>). Because of the high computational complexity of path planning, these planners usually employ different heuristics to guide the search of the robot from its initial to its final position. <p> Our analysis is not very sensitive to local difficulties of the C-space and carries over in any C-space dimension. The analysis given in this paper together with the analysis in [10] are also presented in the context of the general planning scheme in <ref> [3] </ref>. In that work the distance of the robot from the obstacles in the workspace is used to define a random sampling scheme for path planning.

Reference-contexts: The theoretical estimation of N can make the full automation of the technique possible, and permit its application in a wide variety of environments with minimal user effort. The theoretical analysis of PRM is a difficult task. The work in <ref> [10] </ref> initiated the analysis. It related the performance of the planner to the goodness of the C-space of the problem in consideration. <p> Our analysis is not very sensitive to local difficulties of the C-space and carries over in any C-space dimension. The analysis given in this paper together with the analysis in <ref> [10] </ref> are also presented in the context of the general planning scheme in [3]. In that work the distance of the robot from the obstacles in the workspace is used to define a random sampling scheme for path planning. <p> In this section we study a simple problem in two dimensions. For the problem shown in Fig. 3 we estimate N using equation (10), equation (11) and the method of analysis of <ref> [10] </ref>. The parameter of the problem is *, the length of the opening near point a, which is taken to tend to 0. We have jF j = 1 so that ff = =4. <p> Estimate after <ref> [10] </ref>: The space in Fig. 3 is, in the terminology of [10], a (C* 2 )-good space. <p> Estimate after <ref> [10] </ref>: The space in Fig. 3 is, in the terminology of [10], a (C* 2 )-good space. This means that every point of F can be connected with a free straight line segment to a set of points of F whose area is at least C* 2 (clearly because of the box on the left). Then (see Theorem 2.1 in [10] and <p> of <ref> [10] </ref>, a (C* 2 )-good space. This means that every point of F can be connected with a free straight line segment to a set of points of F whose area is at least C* 2 (clearly because of the box on the left). Then (see Theorem 2.1 in [10] and the definition of adequate sets of points) one needs to have N * 2 log * in order to bound the failure probability away from 1. <p> Comparison: Theorem 2 clearly exploits the fact that r (t) is small only briefly to gain an extra logarithm in the estimate (13) with respect to (12) and (14). Note that Theorem 1 and the approach taken in <ref> [10] </ref> refer to quantities - the minimum of r (t) and the goodness of F which are single numbers defined globally over the whole space. <p> Theorem 2 achieves a better estimate for N because it is less sensitive to local difficulties than are the bounds of Theorem 1 and the analysis in <ref> [10] </ref>. It should be said that the true answer is N * 2 ; (15) since it is necessary and sufficient to put a bounded number of points in the box, which happens with probability * 2 .
