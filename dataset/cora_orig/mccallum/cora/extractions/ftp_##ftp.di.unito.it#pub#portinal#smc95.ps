Abstract: The present paper describes the formal connection between model-based diagnostic problem solving (usually performed inside logical frameworks) and Petri net reachability analysis, in case the model of the device under examination is described through a net model. We show that, by suitably re-formulating a diagnostic problem in a net-based setting, the characterization of the diagnostic process can be obtained in terms of reachability of a given marking, representing the current observed parameters of the system to be diagnosed, from a particular marking representing the diagnosis. Reach-ability graph and P-invariant analysis can then be suitably used to perform diagnostic problem solving. A system called Invads, implementing the invariant-based approach to diagnosis, is then briefly described.

Reference-contexts: A technique called B-W Analysis has been developed, able to prune paths of the backward reach-ability graph leading to inconsistent situations. This technique has been quite deeply discussed in <ref> [1] </ref>, where also a possible parallel implementation, based on a distributed message-passing approach, has been suggested. Next section will then be devoted to discuss an alternative approach based on an algebraic analysis of the BPN model. III. <p> Such a model describes the behavior of the device under examination and reachability analysis can be conducted in order to perform diagnostic problem solving. Two basic alternative approaches exist, the first based on reachabil-ity graph construction (called B-W analysis and deeply discussed in other papers <ref> [1, 13] </ref>), the second based on algebraic analysis and in particular on the computation of invariants of the net model.

Reference-contexts: aspect dealt with by the Invads system, that has not been discussed in the present paper, concerns the ability of considering contextual information to the diagnostic problem; in a nutshell, contexts represent information about observable parameters that have not to be explained, but that contribute to characterize the diagnoses (see <ref> [3] </ref> for more details). In particular, contexts are used in Invads to prune supports containing information conflicting with current contextual information, at the same ways of findings represented by places in the set P .

Reference-contexts: input places until no sink transition is present in the net The fact that simplification S2 does not alter the set of P-invariants of the net is deeply discussed (in terms of T-invariants on a dual net) in [13] and it is based on the Affirmative-Negative Simplification Rule proposed in <ref> [4] </ref> for a set of Horn clauses, whose application to net invariants has been proposed in [7].

Reference-contexts: Petri net consists in associating an nonnegative number of tokens with each place and can be described through a function : P ! IN ; it allows the description of the dynamics of the net through the so-called concession and firing rules (readers unaware of these notions are referred to <ref> [10] </ref>). <p> Since the whole set of invariants of a net can be characterized by the set of invariants having minimal supports (with respect to set inclusion) <ref> [10] </ref>, we will be interested in computing the minimal supports of the P-invariants of the net 1 . The general diagnostic algorithm based on P-invariant computation is sketched in figure 3.

Reference-contexts: What is worth noting is that the BPN model is not proposed as a direct tool of diagnostic knowledge representation, but rather as a modeling tool that can be derived from some other forms of knowledge representation such as causal networks as described in <ref> [11] </ref>. A diagnostic system for P-invariant based diagnosis has been constructed, the Invads system, and experiments are planned in order to compare the approach with B-W analysis and with purely logical approaches.

Reference-contexts: The support Y of a P-invariant Y 0 is the subset of places corresponding to nonzero entries of Y (analogously for T-invariants where entries correspond to transitions). In <ref> [12] </ref>, a T-invariant analysis on an unbounded net model (i.e. with places potentially being marked with an infinite number of tokens) of a hierarchical definite logic program was proposed to perform diagnostic reasoning. <p> By point 4 of definition 1, we have that the dual net (i.e. the net obtained by exchanging places with transitions) of the T1-transform of a BPN is such that 8t 2 T N [T OR jt * j 1 and so it satisfies the following property (see <ref> [12] </ref>): Proposition 2 Let t be a sink transition; there exists a T-invariant X such that X (t) 6= 0 if and only if t is firable from the empty marking. As a consequence we obtain the following theorem.

Reference-contexts: For the lack of space, we do not P 0 P 0 P 1 P 1 t t 0 t 1 t 2 discuss here the axioms of the definition of a BPN (see <ref> [13] </ref> for more details), however, notice that the irreflex-ivity of the transitive closure of the flow relationship F , representing the arcs of the net, can be justified from the fact that we aim at modeling causal processes without taking into account temporal aspects. <p> A particular property of a marked BPN is that it determines a unique marking from which no transition is enabled; such a marking is called final marking. In <ref> [13] </ref> it is formally shown that a BPN corresponds to a popular model for logic-based diagnosis, i.e. to hierarchical definite logic programs; in particular, an interpretation function can be defined in order to associate ground atoms to places of the BPN. <p> The formal connection between such characterizations is established by means of the following theorem whose proof can be found in <ref> [13] </ref>: Theorem 1 Given a logic-based diagnostic problem L-DP=&lt; S; Exp; + ; &gt;, let N S be the BPN corresponding to S and E be the marking corresponding to E Exp, if then S [ E ` ff (c) $ (N s ; E ) ` ff (c) This naturally <p> + [ P ; S2 iteratively remove each sink transition and its input places until no sink transition is present in the net The fact that simplification S2 does not alter the set of P-invariants of the net is deeply discussed (in terms of T-invariants on a dual net) in <ref> [13] </ref> and it is based on the Affirmative-Negative Simplification Rule proposed in [4] for a set of Horn clauses, whose application to net invariants has been proposed in [7]. <p> In fact, parallel algorithms are available for computing the invariants of a Petri net [8], but more interestingly, such a computation can be split into independent computations in case of models like the T1-transform of a BPN (see <ref> [7, 13] </ref> for more details in case of T-invariant computation).
