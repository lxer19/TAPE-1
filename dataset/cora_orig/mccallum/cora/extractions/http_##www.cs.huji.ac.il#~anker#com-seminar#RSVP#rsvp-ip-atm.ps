Title: "Classical" RSVP and IP over ATM

Abstract: Integrated Services in the Internet is rapidly becoming a reality. Meanwhile, ATM technology is appearing in the marketplace. It is an important problem to integrate ATM networks into this emerging Integrated Services Internet. "Classical" IP over ATM[9, 10] is now widely deployed, effectively solving the problem of "best effort service" in internets with ATM links. A key remaining issue is to provide the Internet Integrated Services (IIS) model over internets with ATM links. The setup or signalling portion of the IIS model is called RSVP (Resource ReSerVation Protocol). This paper recommends extensions to classical IP over ATM to allow better integration of ATM networks with the IIS model and more specifically with RSVP signalling.

Reference-contexts: For any pair of IP/ATM edge devices (i.e. hosts or routers), a single VC is created on demand and shared for all traffic between the two devices. A second part of the RSVP and IIS over ATM problem, IP multicast, is close to being solved with MARS <ref> [1] </ref>, the Multicast Address Resolution Server. The MARS server generalizes ATMARP by allowing an IP address to resolve into a list of native ATM addresses, rather than just a single address. There is work in progress on alternative IP over ATM models (e.g.

Reference-contexts: We have a prototype system using the limited heterogeneity model running at ISI and we are experimenting with it now. There are a number of other issues that are subjects of continuing research. These issues (and others) are covered in <ref> [2] </ref>, and are briefly repeated here. One key issue is how to translate an Internet Integrated Services (IIS) QoS 10 to an ATM QoS. Fortunately, this issue seems to be getting easier as the IETF and ATM Forum QoS definitions are getting more similar as they evolve.

Reference-contexts: For real-time traffic such as voice and video, the current Internet has performed well only across unloaded networks. In order to provide guaranteed quality real-time traffic, new classes of service and new protocols are being introduced in the Internet <ref> [3, 5] </ref>, while retaining the existing best effort service. Signalling for these new services is done by RSVP [4, 11], the Resource ReSerVation Protocol. Due to extensive telephone company support, ATM is rapidly becoming an important link layer technology.

Reference-contexts: If chosen poorly, there might be many VC setups failing while other bandwidth is unused. An additional problem is that the ability of ATM to do QoS dependent routing is wasted. A third issue is making changes to ATM signalling (see <ref> [6] </ref>). The operation of RSVP over ATM networks would be aided by changing two areas of ATM signalling, renegotiating the QoS of existing VCs, and heterogeneous (or variegated) VCs. Renegotiating VCs means dynamically changing the QoS of an existing (especially point-to-multipoint) VC.

Reference-contexts: Full heterogeneity is possible where a separate VC could be created for each distinct QoS for a multicast session. While we advocate the limited heterogeneity approach as in section 4.1, different service providers may choose alternate approaches. RSVP allows for local policy control <ref> [7] </ref> as well as admission control. Thus a user can request a reservation with a specific QoS and with a policy object that, for example, offers to pay for additional costs setting up a new VC.

Reference-contexts: The MARS server generalizes ATMARP by allowing an IP address to resolve into a list of native ATM addresses, rather than just a single address. There is work in progress on alternative IP over ATM models (e.g. NHRP <ref> [8] </ref>) however the solutions described here for the classical model are still expected to apply. A key remaining issue for IP over ATM is the integration of RSVP signalling and ATM signalling in support of the Internet Integrated Services (IIS) model.

Reference-contexts: It is only natural that RSVP and the Internet Integrated Services (IIS) model would like to utilize the QoS properties of any underlying link layer, and this paper concentrates on ATM. Classical IP over ATM <ref> [9] </ref> has solved part of this problem, supporting IP unicast traffic over ATM. Classical IP over ATM is based on a Logical IP Subnetwork (LIS), which is a separately administered IP subnetwork.
