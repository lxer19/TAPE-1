Abstract: We present a compositional model of paper transportation in a photocopier that is meant to support different problem solving tasks like simulation and diagnosis, and to be applicable to a variety of configurations. Therefore, we try to avoid making hard-wired implicit assumptions about design principles and possible scenarios. In order to simplify our analysis, the model abstracts away from the physical forces and reasons only about velocities. Nonetheless, it succeeds in determining essential features of the motion of the sheet of paper like buckling and tearing. The framework provided is quite generic and can be used as a starting point for developing models of other transportation domains. fl Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, 3333 Coyote Hill Road, Palo Alto CA 94304 USA.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, a straight segment is tearing if its right speed exceeds its left speed, but the last consequence makes tearing an exception, reflecting the assumption that sheets are usually strong. It is a default rule in the sense of <ref> [Rei80] </ref> and means that if the model allows for a solution without tearing, then tearing will remain false. In the 9 comparison of velocities at different pathpoints, we exploit the assumption stated in Section 4.1 that the sections are aligned.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A photocopier is a device with a clear and fixed structure that seems to lend itself to standard component-based modeling techniques. However, as already pointed out in reports about earlier modeling attempts <ref> [S + 87] </ref>, this is true only if we ignore the sheets of paper that move around and interact with the copier's components, often in a way that forces us as users to sequences of recovery actions.

Reference-contexts: An attempt to model the forces, motions and deformation of a sheet of paper under the influence of some rollers can lead to quite sophisticated mathematical models <ref> [SL81b, SL81a] </ref>. <p> In addition, rollers have different speeds, for example we will assume that the belt and roller 8 in the upper loop of the path move faster than the rollers in the lower part of the path. Thus the paper is pulled by the roller pair number 8. <ref> [SL81b] </ref> have shown that under normal operating conditions the coefficient of friction between paper and rollers is sufficiently high to prevent any slipping. On the other hand, the friction between belts and paper is quite low, so sufficient slipping may occur.

Reference-contexts: In this way we still avoid a detailed study of acceleration. However, a "gold-standard" model that includes forces, accelerations, mass and inertia, has to be related to our model in order to reveal its assumptions and limitations (e.g. using the theory of model transformation and simplification of <ref> [Str92] </ref>). As of now, this model exists and has been analyzed on paper. We plan to formulate it as a domain theory in CML ([F + 94]), and also implement it in tcc ([SJG94, SJG95]), a reactive declarative constraint-based language.
