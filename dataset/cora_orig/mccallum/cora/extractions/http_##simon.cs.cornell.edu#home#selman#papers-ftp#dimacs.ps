Abstract: It has recently been shown that local search is surprisingly good at finding satisfying assignments for certain classes of CNF formulas (Sel-man et al. 1992). In this paper we demonstrate that the power of local search for satisfiability testing can be further enhanced by employing a new strategy, called "mixed random walk", for escaping from local minima. We present a detailed comparison of this strategy with simulated annealing, and show that mixed random walk is the superior strategy on several classes of computationally difficult problem instances. We also present results demonstrating the effectiveness of local search with walk for solving circuit synthesis and diagnosis problems. Finally, we show that mixed random walk improves upon the results of Hansen and Jaumard on MAX-SAT problems.

Reference-contexts: For example, we con 8 pecially considered the fact that fastest current systematic search methods cannot solve hard random 3CNF instances with over 400 variables <ref> (Dubois et al. 1993) </ref>. The columns marked with "flips" give the average number of flips required to find an assignment. (A "flip" in our simulated annealing algorithm is an actual change in the truth assignment.

Reference-contexts: The data for the first five methods are from Hansen and Jaumard (1990). and "zjohn2", a simulated annealing approach called "anneal", and their own "steepest ascent, mildest descent" algorithm, "zsamd". The last one is similar to basic GSAT with a form of a tabu list <ref> (Glover 1989) </ref>. They showed that "zsamd" consistently outperformed the other approaches. We repeated their main experiments using GSAT with walk. The problem instances are randomly generated 3SAT and 4SAT instances.

Reference-contexts: This process is repeated as needed up to a maximum of MAX-TRIES times. In Selman et al.

As noted above, local minima in the search space of a combinatorial problem are the primary obstacle to the application of local search methods.

Reference-contexts: A local minimum is defined as a state whose local neighborhood does not include a state that is strictly better. The standard approach in combinatorial optimization of terminating the search when a local minimum is reached <ref> (Papadimitriou and Steiglitz 1982) </ref> does not work well for Boolean satisfiability testing, since only global optima are of interest. In Selman et al. (1992) it is shown that simply continuing to search by making non-improving, "sideways" moves, dramatically increases the success rate of the algorithm.

Reference-contexts: However, this method does not work for general CNF. We therefore propose the following approach, that mixes the 2CNF strategy with greedy search <ref> (see also Selman and Kautz 1993) </ref>: Random Walk Strategy With probability p, pick a variable occuring in some unsatisfied clause and flip its truth assignment. With probability 1 p, follow the standard GSAT scheme, i.e., make the best possible local move.
