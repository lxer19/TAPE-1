Abstract: Texture is an important preattentive cue in region-based segmentation of images. In this paper, we discuss the use of circular-Mellin features for segmenting an image into homogenous regions. The circular-Mellin operators represent the spectral decomposition of the image scene in the polar-log coordinate system and are invariant to both scale and orientation of the target. Coupled with the unique shift invariance property of the correlator architecture, these circular-Mellin operators can be used for rotation- and scale-invariant feature extraction. We note that while both these feature extractors have similar functional form to the Gabor functions, the distortion-invariant characteristics of the circular-Mellin operators make them preferable for texture segmentation. Segmentation results to demonstrate their salient properties are presented.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Segmentation of an image into regions that are homogenous with respect to a particular perceptual property is an important task in several image understanding applications, and thus has received considerable attention during the past two decades <ref> [1] </ref>. It has been observed that images of scenes are signals with a high degree of self-correlation. Fundamentally, mutual information arises within an image because of the fact that physical scenes and objects tend to have internal morphological consistency, including the first, second- and other higher-order correlations.

Reference-contexts: These correlations are attributes that distinguish real images from random noise and from one another, a distinction that is often not fully exploited. Linear filtering is a common approach to extract local texture properties from images. Studies in linear filter design theory <ref> [2] </ref> show that it is possible to design and optimize local linear filters for maximal texture discrimination. Some of the more recent linear filtering schemes seek to exploit certain properties of human vision.

Reference-contexts: Some of the more recent linear filtering schemes seek to exploit certain properties of human vision. The use of Gaussian-modulated sinusoids (Gabor functions) to model cortical simple cell receptive field profiles was proposed in 1980 by Marcelja <ref> [3] </ref> in 1-D form and by Daugman [4] in 2-D form. The virtues of the Gabor function include its explicit parameterization for 2-D receptive field position, preferred orientation and preferred spatial frequency.

Instead of the Gabor functions, one could also use other models such as the wavelet transforms <ref> [8] </ref>, the prolate sper-oidal sequences [9], the Hermite polynomials [10], the pseudo-Wigner distribution [11], estimates of the local power spectra (or real moments) [12], or more preferably the complex moments [13]. In a typical texture segmentation problem, the location, orientation and scale of the textures are all unknown.

In a typical texture segmentation problem, the location, orientation and scale of the textures are all unknown. So a texture segmentation algorithm should pay specific attention to all of these variables, as prior knowledge of one or more of these parameters is not always practical.

Reference-contexts: These circular-Mellin features correspond to Fourier features in the polar-log domain. The polar-log coordinate transformation is used to achieve rotation and scale invari-ance, similar to the attractive properties offered by the chord transformation <ref> [14] </ref> approach proposed by Krose. The correlator architecture is used to achieve translation invariance. Once the different textures have been recognized, one can use a single set of texture-invariant "oriented" features to identify the orientation of all textures in the input scene.

Reference-contexts: The use of CHFs for rotation-invariant pattern recognition is well known in literature [15,16]. Similarly, a scale-invariant correlation filter is of the form h (; ) = exp () exp (j2p)h p (): (2) The Mellin harmonic function (MHF) in Eq. (2) has been used for scale-invariant pattern recognition <ref> [17] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This term also acts as a local window function, similar to the Gaussian window used in the Gabor functions. An alternate interpretation of the properties of these "circular-Mellin" feature extractors (CMFs) can be obtained based on the properties of the Fourier series and Fourier transform <ref> [18] </ref>. In Cartesian coordinates, the magnitude of the Fourier coefficient is shift-invariant, i.e. the magnitude carries the structural information within the target of interest while the actual location of the target is contained in the phase information.

Reference-contexts: For all of our tests we used max = 3 and min = 0, and the different circular-Mellin feature extractors are orthogonal. All of our results use only one circular-Mellin feature for segmentation to highlight their properties, although more than one feature is required for more complicated problems <ref> [19] </ref>, as we discuss later. Fig. 1 shows the segmentation of the wood and straw textures using a single circular-Mellin texture operator (p = 9; q = 3). For each circular-Mellin feature extractor, a correlation plane of the texture operator with the input image is first generated.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 3 (a) shows the segmentation results obtained for the image of a cat, extracted from the article by Harry Voorhees and Tomaso Poggio in "Nature" <ref> [20] </ref>. In this case, three different regions have been identified using only one circular-Mellin feature. However, in more complicated situations, with several possible combinations of textures in the same input, it is not reasonable to expect a single circular-Mellin feature to provide successful segmentation.
