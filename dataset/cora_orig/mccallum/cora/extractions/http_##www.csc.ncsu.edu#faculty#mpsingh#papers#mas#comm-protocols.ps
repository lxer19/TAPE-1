Abstract: Commitments are crucial to understanding and designing autonomous agents and multiagent systems. We propose a definition of commitments that maximizes the autonomy of the individual agents, and the flexibility of the multiagent systems they constitute. Our approach has a number of important features, including * not gratuitously translating social concepts to psychological concepts * distinguishing between satisfied and inapplicable commitments * incorporating social policies to handle the creation, satisfaction, and other ma nipulation of commitments * showing how commitments, appropriately structured, can lead to flexible interactions among agents, resulting in coherent behavior by the given multiagent system in varying circumstances.

Reference-contexts: Failure recovery is typically achieved by compensating the subtransac-tions that erroneously recorded success (even though other related transactions did not)|the compensations are of course domain-specific. Consider the following example, which uses a simplified version of the DOM ETM <ref> [ Buchmann et al., 1992 ] </ref> . v-id idia a b 43 h-id dia h14 43 hoses odia 21 43 valves LT1 LT2 GT LT1 -1 LT2 -1 Example 3 Continuing with Example 2, we now define a purchase activity as in Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: We believe that with further technical development, this will prove to be an important point in favor of social commitments. 5.2 DB and Groupware Approaches A number of extended transaction models have been proposed, e.g., <ref> [ Bukhres & Elmagarmid, 1996 ] </ref> . The extended transaction models allow partial results to be released, and then attempt to restore consistency through actions to compensate for the effects of erroneously completed actions. Some workflow scheduling approaches exist that provide functionality to capture control flow among tasks.

Reference-contexts: In fact, it is known that in settings with asynchronous, unreliable or unboundedly delayable communication, mutual beliefs can be obtained only if they are there from the start|i.e., the mutual beliefs are the invariants of the system <ref> [ Chandy & Misra, 1986 ] </ref> . We conjecture that named groups and named commitments, which are reminiscent of contract numbers in business dealings, provide the necessary connections among the agents.

Reference-contexts: For example, the seller role presupposes that the seller will respond to requests for price quotes, and honor its quotes. The abstract SoComs are instantiated with concrete agents filling each role. The concrete agents may be individuals or groups. Recalling <ref> [ Gasser, 1991 ] </ref> , a concrete agent may fill in more than one role in an abstract SoCom, and participate in more than one abstract SoCom concurrently. The act of joining a SoCom corresponds to creating commitments. 10 The commitments associated with a role are schematic. <p> a second prototype using a commercial rule-based agent framework, and also developing a coordination approach based on temporal logic for providing the infrastructure for coordinating autonomous agents [ Singh, 1997 ] . 5 Comparisons with the Literature 5.1 DAI Approaches Gasser describes some of the sociological issues underlying multiagent systems <ref> [ Gasser, 1991 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: To avoid terminological confusion, we use the term "succeed" instead of the database term "commit" where only the success of an individual transaction is implied. 2.1 Traditional Database Transactions Traditional transactions are computations that satisfy a number of useful properties, in particular the so-called ACID properties <ref> [ Gray & Reuter, 1993 ] </ref> : * atomicity: all or none of a transaction happens * consistency: a transaction preserves the consistency of the database * isolation: intermediate results of a transaction are not visible externally * durability: when a transaction concludes successfully, its effects are permanent.

Reference-contexts: On the one hand, DTMSs can be given a knowledge-level characterization in terms of commitments; on the other hand, they can be used to implement some of the reasoning required in maintaining commitments. Social versus Psychological Primitives. Some previous approaches, e.g., <ref> [ Levesque et al., 1990; Grosz & Sidner, 1990 ] </ref> , attempt to reduce social constructs to psychological constructs. They do not have an explicit construct for commitments, but postulate mutual beliefs among the committing agents.

Reference-contexts: The approach of [ Levesque et al., 1990 ] requires the agents to have a mutual belief about their goals. Further, it hardwires a specific approach to canceling commitments (for joint intentions)|the participating agents must achieve a mutual belief that the given commitment has been canceled. The approach of <ref> [ Jennings, 1993 ] </ref> is closer in spirit to the present approach. Jennings postulates conventions as ways in which to reason about commitments. Thus, he can generalize on [ Levesque et al., 1990 ] . <p> However, for teams, he requires a "minimum" convention, which recalls the approach of [ Levesque et al., 1990 ] . Jennings also requires a mental state as concomitant with a joint commitment. While we share many of the motivations of <ref> [ Jennings, 1993 ] </ref> , we attain greater generality through the explicit use of the structure of multiagent systems. The agents always enter into commitments in the context of their multiagent system, and sometimes to that system.

Reference-contexts: We also believe that our approach with its emphasis on structure and context can be married with that of [ Sichman et al., 1994 ] to lead to more sophisticated forms of social reasoning.

Reference-contexts: The multiagent system serves as the default repository for the social policies, although these can, in several useful cases, be assigned to the member agents. We believe the relationship of our approach to open-nested transaction models and workflows will lead to superior multiagent systems for information applications. Distributed assumption-based <ref> [ Mason & Johnson, 1989 ] </ref> or justification-based [ Huhns & Bridgeland, 1991 ] truth maintenance systems (DTMSs) are also germane.

Reference-contexts: For example, information control nets are primarily geared toward control and data flow aspects [ Nutt, 1993 ] . The notion of commitments finds applicability in some groupware tools. For example, <ref> [ Medina-Mora & Cartron, 1996 ] </ref> shows how the flow of work in an organization is expressed through commitments in the ActionWorkflow tool. This tool comes with a fixed set of specifications from which the developer can choose.

Reference-contexts: For example, they ignore social commitments altogether. Some of the groupware approaches, which study organizational structure, do not consider quite as rich a form of commitments as here.

Reference-contexts: They do not have an explicit construct for commitments, but postulate mutual beliefs among the committing agents. However, mutual beliefs require the agents to hold beliefs about each other to unbounded levels of nesting, which can be tricky <ref> [ Singh, 1996 ] </ref> . Also, mutual beliefs cannot be implemented except through additional simplifying assumptions, which is why the direct approach of using social constructs is more appealing.
