Abstract: We consider a fluid model similar to that of Kella and Whitt [33], but with a buffer having finite capacity K. The connections between the infinite buffer fluid model and the G/G/1 queue established in [33] are extended to the finite buffer case: It is shown that the stationary distribution of the buffer content is related to the stationary distribution of the finite dam. We also derive a number of new results for the latter model. In particular, an asymptotic expansion for the loss fraction is given for the case of subexponential service times. The stationary buffer content distribution of the fluid model is also related to that of the corresponding model with infinite buffer size, by showing that the two corresponding probability measures are proportional on [0; K ) if the silence periods are exponentially distributed. These results are applied to obtain large buffer asymptotics for the loss fraction and the mean buffer content when the fluid queue is fed by N on-off sources with subexponential on-periods. The asymptotic results show a significant influence of heavy-tailed input characteristics on the performance of the fluid queue.

Reference-contexts: The on-off source with the heaviest tail dominates the asymptotic behaviour, whereas other sources only contribute to the asymptotics through their means. In <ref> [2] </ref>, this notion is called a reduced load balance and is shown to hold for the tail of Z under much more general conditions. The conditions under which the tail behaviour for W in Lemma 6.1 is valid can also be weakened, see [10]. <p> In particular, the results in <ref> [2] </ref> show that Lemma 6.1 and Theorem 6.2 remain true in the case of N regularly varying sources, as long as the tail activity period of the first source is heavier than is the case for the other sources. 7. <p> We note however, that the analysis of this model is already quite difficult in the infinite buffer case, see e.g. <ref> [2] </ref>. A challenging topic for future research is to obtain asymptotic expansions for the loss fraction for this practically important case. 9. Appendix In this section we give a direct proof of the proportionality result in Section 5 (Theorem 5.2), because we believe it is interesting in itself.

Reference-contexts: Since all state spaces are finite, it is trivially seen that all regeneration cycles have finite means. The convergence of the processes [Z K (t); I (t)], Z K a (t) and Z K s (t) now follows by the results on pp. 125-127 of <ref> [3] </ref>. By a result of Green [25], we can study the sequences of activity periods and silence periods separately. <p> In this section, we give some new results for the finite dam. In particular, we give a relationship between the virtual and actual waiting time which is very similar to the relationship in the infinite buffer case. The latter is well known (see e.g. p. 189 in <ref> [3] </ref>). First, we introduce some notation in the traditional queueing setting. Customers arrive at a single server queue (which is initially empty) with interarrival times (A n ) n1 . These customers have service times (B n ) n1 . <p> For the virtual waiting time V and the actual waiting time W in the GI/G/1 queue (with ^ae &lt; 1), it is well known that (see e.g. <ref> [3, 15, 17] </ref>) V jV &gt; 0 = W + e B: (3.3) The following result is very similar to (3.3) and appears to be new. <p> We start with two preliminary observations. 1. Let c and c K be the length of a busy cycle for the infinite buffer model and the model with finite buffer K respectively. Then, the laws of Z and Z K are given by, cf. <ref> [14, 3] </ref> P (Z x) = E [c] 2 c Z 1 [0;x] (Z (t))dt 5 ; (9.1) 1 E 4 0 3 2.

Reference-contexts: Special attention is paid to the analysis of the fluid model in the case that the input process can be decribed by on-off sources with heavy-tailed activity period distributions. All the techniques used can be found in the books [8, 21]. We also refer to the survey <ref> [10] </ref> on fluid queues with heavy-tailed activity period distributions. The asymptotic expansions that are derived for the loss fraction and the mean buffer content show that the heavy-tailed input characteristics have a significant influence on the performance of the fluid queue. <p> Such a result would involve the tail behaviour of R 1 ( e D 1 ) (cf. Theorem 3.15 in <ref> [10] </ref> and (2.12)), for which no results are available. 6.2 A single on-off source Suppose that the fluid queue is driven by a single on-off source. When the source is active, it sends input with rate r &gt; 1 during a period of D 1 . <p> The asymptotic expansions for the loss probability and the mean buffer content given below are based on the following results. Suppose the distribution of e D 1 is subexponential. Then (see e.g. <ref> [10] </ref>): P (W &gt; x) 1 ^ae P (Z &gt; x) p 1 ae 6. <p> The same conclusion can be drawn if the activity periods are exponentially distributed. fl We now turn to the mean buffer content, where we restrict ourself to the (important) special case of activity periods with infinite second moments (corresponding to long-range dependent input, see <ref> [10] </ref>). It is also assumed that the silence periods are exponentially distributed. <p> Using this, it is not difficult to calculate E [D 1 ] and E [R 1 (D 1 )]. The following result is part of Theorem 4.6 in <ref> [10] </ref>. Lemma 6.1 Suppose that the activity periods of the sources 2,...,N are exponentially distributed and suppose that P (A 1 &gt; x) = L (x)x ; 6. Asymptotic results for the fluid queue 18 for &gt; 1. <p> In [2], this notion is called a reduced load balance and is shown to hold for the tail of Z under much more general conditions. The conditions under which the tail behaviour for W in Lemma 6.1 is valid can also be weakened, see <ref> [10] </ref>. Lemma 6.1 leads to the following results for the loss fraction and the mean buffer content in the finite buffer case. Theorem 6.2 Suppose that the conditions stated in Lemma 6.1 are valid. <p> 1 p 1 1 ae 1 2 ae M L (K)K 2 : (6.15) Proof The first part follows easily from Lemma 6.1, Theorem 3.1, and Theorem 5.3, or alternatively, from Theorem 6.1 and the tail behaviour of R 1 (D 1 ), which is given in Theorem 4.6 of <ref> [10] </ref>. The proof of the second part follows the same lines as the proof of Proposition 6.2 and is therefore omitted. ffi Theorem 6.2 can be generalised to more generally distributed activity periods (for all sources), as long as Lemma 6.1 remains valid under these assumptions. <p> For more results, like upper bounds for the tail of R 1 (D 1 ), W and Z in this model, which may be used to obtain upper bounds for the loss fraction and the mean buffer content in the finite buffer case, we refer to Section 5.2 in <ref> [10] </ref> and to [27, 40]. 7.

Reference-contexts: A secondary purpose of this study is to establish simple relations between the fluid model with finite buffer size K and the infinite buffer model, and between the finite-buffered fluid model and the G/G/1 queue with finite capacity K, also known as the finite dam (see <ref> [17, 36] </ref>). The results available for the latter models can then be used to analyse the former. <p> Under the condition P (S 1 (U 1 ) = R 1 (D 1 )) &lt; 1, it is shown in Section III.5.3 of <ref> [17] </ref> that Z K (T k+1 ) converges in distribution to a limiting random variable W K if k ! 1. <p> The latter model is also known as the finite dam, cf. Chapter III.5 in <ref> [17] </ref>. First, we make some additional definitions. With f (x) g (x) we mean that f (x)=g (x) converges to one. <p> times U 1 + + U k . ffi One can apply Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 to compute (characteristics of) the distribution of Z K when the steady state distribution for the G=G=1 finite dam is tractable enough, which is the case for the M/G/1 and G/M/1 finite dams, see <ref> [17, 36] </ref>. In Section 5, we will further specify the distribution of Z K by using Theorems 2.1 and 2.2. <p> When W K n + B n exceeds K, a quantity of W K n + B n K is lost (so we consider partial overflow). Hence, W K n is given by W K 0 = 0 and (see e.g. Chapter III.5 in <ref> [17] </ref>), W K n+1 = maxfminfW K n + B n ; Kg A n+1 ; 0g: (3.1) Denote the stationary waiting time by W K (cf.

Proportionality relations like (3.6) have been applied in a number of studies to determine loss probabilities, see e.g. [20, 41, 23, 24, 9] and references therein. <p> It follows from the proportionality relation that P q;K = P (W K) But this quantity can be identified with P (V max &gt; K), where V max is the maximal content in the infinite dam during a busy cycle, see e.g. Section 3.3 in [14] or <ref> [17] </ref>, p. 297, and p. 618, so we conclude that P q;K = P (V max &gt; K) = dK P (W K) : (3.12) 4. <p> The evolution of this queueing model (which is equivalent to the G/G/1 queue with uniformly bounded actual waiting time, see e.g. Chapter III.4 in <ref> [17] </ref>) can be described by the random variables W K n in the proof of Theorem 4.2. In this model, the loss fraction equals P ( W K + e B A &gt; K). <p> This is the case if the second moment of the service time is finite (cf. the classical result of Kingman for the GI/G/1 queue, see e.g. <ref> [17] </ref>), but also if the service time distribution is regularly varying and has infinite variance, see e.g. [12, 19]. <p> Our conjecture is that the heavy traffic limit theorem can be extended to generally distributed silence periods. For a similar result for the G/G/1 queue with uniformly bounded actual waiting time (Chapter III.4 in <ref> [17] </ref>), we refer to [32] and references therein. fl 6. <p> If the silence periods are exponentially distributed, it is possible to use the results for the M/G/1 queue with finite capacity K given in Section III.5 of <ref> [17] </ref>.

The processes [Z K (t); I (t)], Z K s (t) are all regenerative with the exit times of state [0,1], resp. 0 (i.e. the end of idle periods) as regeneration points. <p> Proof Similarly to the proof of Theorem 2 in <ref> [33] </ref>. <p> The stationary distribution of the fluid queue In this section, we study the distribution of the steady state buffer content Z K in the fluid queue. Under certain assumptions, we express the distribution of Z K completely in terms of W K , thereby extending the results in <ref> [33] </ref> to the finite buffer case. In a special case, it is also possible to express the distribution of Z K in terms of Z, by showing that the two probability measures are proportional. <p> When the source is active, it sends input with rate r &gt; 1 during a period of D 1 .
