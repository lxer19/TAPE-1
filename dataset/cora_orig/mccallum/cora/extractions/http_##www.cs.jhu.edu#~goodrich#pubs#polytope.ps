Abstract: We show that several well-known optimization problems involving 3-dimensional convex polyhedra and decision trees are NP-hard or NP-complete. One of the techniques we employ is a linear-time method for realizing a planar 3-connected triangulation as a convex polyhedron, which may be of independent interest. Key words: Convex polyhedra, approximation, Steinitz's theorem, planar graphs, art gallery theorems, decision trees.

Reference-contexts: We begin by showing that the well-known vertex cover problem 2 remains NP-complete even for 3-connected planar graphs, and show how this can be used to further extend the NP-completeness of vertex covering to convex polyhedra in IR 3 . This extends the previous results of Garey and Johnson <ref> [18] </ref> and Garey, Johnson, and Stockmeyer [19], which showed that the vertex cover problem remains NP-complete for planar graphs with degree at most three. 3.1 Vertex Cover for 3-connected planar graphs Our reduction is actually a chain of reductions, starting from the (standard) vertex cover problem. <p> Our reduction will be from the vertex cover problem for 3-connected planar graphs. So, let G be a 3-connected planar graph and let k be a given integer parameter. Our reduction is a modification of an argument of Garey and Johnson <ref> [18] </ref>, who showed that vertex cover remains NP-complete for planar graphs with degree at most 3.

Our reduction is an adaptation of the proof of Garey et al. <ref> [19] </ref>, who give a reduction from general graphs to planar graphs that does not preserve 3-connectivity. We begin by drawing G in the plane so as to have c = O (n 2 ) edge crossings (e.g., using a simple straight-line strategy). <p> That is, covering each gadget with 16 nodes establishes a "parity" along any 7 chain of gadgets derived from a single edge in G. Thus, by a counting argument, which is similar to one given by Garey et al. <ref> [19] </ref>, we can conclude that G must have a vertex cover of size k. Therefore, the vertex cover problem remains NP-complete for 3-connected planar graphs.

Reference-contexts: Incidentally, another well-known instance of a geometric optimization problem for polyhedra, which we did not consider is polyhedral separability, which has been the subject of extensive research, e.g., see <ref> [1, 9, 15, 17, 26, 28, 27, 31] </ref>. For example, a heavily-studied 12 instance of this problem is that one given two concentric polyhedra, and one wishes to find a separating polyhedra with minimum faces nested between the two. <p> For example, a heavily-studied 12 instance of this problem is that one given two concentric polyhedra, and one wishes to find a separating polyhedra with minimum faces nested between the two. The nested polyhedral separability problem that we consider was first raised by Victor Klee <ref> [31] </ref>, which arose during the study of sequential stochastic automata [37]. In two dimensions, this problem has been solved in polynomial time by Aggarwal et al [2]. Das and Joseph [11, 13] proved the interesting result that the problem is NP-hard for three dimensions, even for convex polyhedra.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Convex polyhedra are fundamental geometric structures (e.g., see [20]). They are the product of convex hull algorithms, and are key components for problems in robot motion planning and computer-aided geometric design. Moreover, due to a beautiful theorem of Steinitz <ref> [20, 38] </ref>, they provide a strong link between computational geometry and graph theory, for Steinitz shows that a graph forms the edge structure of a convex polyhedra if and only if it is planar and 3-connected.
