Reference-contexts: Figure 11 (top) shows the contrast gain of model M-cells and P-cells as a function of temporal frequency for several grating contrasts. Comparable data on retinal ganglion M-cells and P-cells in Macaque monkeys are reported by Benardete <ref> [1] </ref> and are shown at the bottom of gain of model M-cells (left) and P-cells (right) as a function of temporal frequency at several grating contrasts. The tests were performed at a background illumination level of 10 3 td and a spatial frequency of 0.009 cycles/pixel (1.3 cycles/degree). <p> The tests were performed at a background illumination level of 10 3 td and a spatial frequency of 0.009 cycles/pixel (1.3 cycles/degree). The bottom figure (left to right) shows similar data for a cat X-cell, and a monkey (X-like) M-cell, and a monkey P-cell from Benardete <ref> [1] </ref>. The M-cell is more sensitive to changes in contrast than the P-cell. Increased levels of contrast lead to diminished contrast gain in the M-cell system due to the nonlinear saturation function. This effect is much less pronounced in P-cells because of their smaller contrast gains.

Reference-contexts: in background illumination level [21]. * The M-cell system in the primate retina has a higher contrast gain than the P-cell system [17][1]. * P-cells are able to respond to much higher spatial frequencies (40-60 cycles/degree) than M cells (10-20 cycles/degree) as a result of their much smaller receptive fields <ref> [8] </ref>. All of the above properties are qualitatively exhibited by our computer retina. As the illumination levels increase, the P-cell and M-cell contrast gain increases and the outputs reach a peak at much higher spatial frequencies of modulation. The M-cell outputs exhibit higher contrast gain (larger 16 5. <p> Figure 10 shows that the M-cell system responds with a much larger gain to temporal stimulation and is thus able to respond better than the P-cell system at both low and high temporal frequencies. This is in agreement with generally cited properties of primate retinal P-cells and M-cells <ref> [8] </ref>. The gain of the computer retina M-cells is about 5-8 times larger than that for the P-cells and is comparable to the factor of 6-7 difference found in monkey cells. <p> Such behaviour is consistent with the notion that P-cells, which have a smaller contrast gain than M-cells, respond linearly with respect to contrast <ref> [8] </ref>. M-cells, however, are easily saturated by moderate to high contrasts in the input signal due to their high contrast gain 20 6.

Reference-contexts: The P-cell and M-cell steady-state responses are only sensitive to spatial edges in the image. All other features fade away in the steady-state response. This is similar to the "fixation blindness" observed in the primate retina where stabilized images on the retina fade away after a very short time <ref> [9] </ref>. Note that there is only one M-cell for every nine P-cells, and thus the outputs of the M-cell layer sample the image at a much coarser resolution than the P-cell layer. from an image database.

To allow for a comparison, a separate experiment recorded the cone outputs in the absence of horizontal cell feedback. The model cone responses are similar to those recorded in the Necturus. <p> The initial cone response to a "flash" slowly decays to a new resting potential as the cone adapts to the new illumination level. The model cone cell response curves are similar to cone responses obtained by Normann in the aspartate treated Necturus retina shown in the bottom figure <ref> [10] </ref>. Note that the cone potential in the Necturus retina hyperpolarizes (becomes more negative) in response to brighter illumination levels and thus is opposite in polarity to the model cone responses. <p> It is only at much brighter intensities that the model bipolar cells respond equally well to negative contrast as well as positive contrast. Figure 7 (bottom) shows the corresponding intensity-response curves obtained by Normann <ref> [10] </ref> and Werblin [19] in the Necturus (cone) and mudpuppy (horizontal and bipolar cell) retinas. Note that the slopes of the fish cone and horizontal cell curves are the negative of those for the corresponding computer retina cells because of the hyperpolarizing nature of these biological cells.

Reference-contexts: Gain and contrast gain are defined here to be consistent with Shapely [16] and Purpura <ref> [11] </ref>: Gain = M ean cell response (Stimulus contrast)(M ean retinal illumination) (1) Contrast gain = (M ean cell response) (Stimulus contrast) (2) Only measurements of contrast gain or absolute gain are given for the computer retina ganglion cell responses. <p> This experiment was repeated for several illumination levels to examine the effects of illumination level on the temporal frequency gain. The model response may be compared to data from recordings in the Macaque monkey LGN made by Purpura <ref> [11] </ref> shown in bottom of Figure 10. The general temporal frequency properties of the computer retina P-cells and M-cells may be summarized as follows. <p> The peak P-cell temporal frequency is around 8-9 Hz and within the range of values (8-12) Hz found in primates <ref> [11] </ref>. In addition, the temporal frequency gain of both M-cells and P-cells is inversely proportional to the mean retinal illumination level at low temporal frequencies and thus is consistent with Weber's law. <p> The monkey data is accounted for by Purpura by adapting the time constants of several lowpass temporal filters (through which the input signal passes) as a function of the illumination level <ref> [11] </ref>. 5.3 Contrast Gain In order to measure the effect of input stimulus contrast on the contrast gain of P-cells and M-cells, an additional experiment was performed and the responses compared to data on a similar experiment performed on monkey retinal ganglion cells. <p> The gain was computed as the mean ganglion cell output level divided by the product of the stimulus contrast c and the background illumination intensity. The data may be compared with recordings of P-cells and M-cells made in the Macaque monkey LGN by Purpura <ref> [11] </ref>. In Purpura's data, a grating of spatial frequency 3 cycles/degree and a grating contrast of 64% was used for the P-cell experiments while gratings of 1.6 cycles/degree and contrasts between 4% and 25% were used for the M-cell experiments. 5.3.

Reference-contexts: This value was chosen to simplify the implementation of a 3 ms delay (t delay ) of the horizontal cell signal to the diffuse bipolar terminal required in the model <ref> [12] </ref>. For some experiments, thousands of image frames had to be processed by the computer retina because these experiments required the input image stimuli to be presented for several seconds of real-time. <p> This discrepancy indicates that the cone time constant (t cone = 10 ms) used in the model may be too small. However, the chosen cone and horizontal cell time constants are consistent with the values used by Richter <ref> [12] </ref>. In all other aspects, the model's cone response appears to behave similarly to the monkey cone cell. 4.2 Effects of Horizontal Cell Feedback on Cone Output To isolate the responses of cones alone, without the horizontal cell feedback, electrophysiologists often treat the retina with an aspartate solution. <p> Although primate horizontal and bipolar cell recordings are not available, Richter estimates that the time constant in mammals may be anywhere from 5-10 times shorter than in fish <ref> [12] </ref>. 4.4 Intensity-Response Curves diffuse bipolar cells. These curves were obtained by plotting the peak amplitudes of the cell output vs. the log intensity of the flashes as obtained from the flashed background experiments described in the previous section.

The monkey cone response is characterized by a peak due to the flash followed by an overshoot when returning to the resting potential.

Reference-contexts: Towards that goal, a model of information processing in the cone pathways of the primate retina has been developed and is presented in detail in a companion report <ref> [15] </ref>. The computer retina model is based closely on biology but has been significantly simplified to allow for the possibility of implementation in silicon. <p> In addition, experiments with more complex images are used to illustrate what the outputs of the primate retina might look like if such bulk recordings were possible. The aim is to show that the retinal model developed in <ref> [15] </ref>, although quite simple, responds in a manner similar to the primate retinal cone system. In particular, the model qualitatively accounts for the gain and sensitivity changes as well as visual acuity changes found in the retina with illumination levels varying over 7 orders of magnitude. 2. <p> Methods 3.1 Model Implementation The model of the retinal cone system as described in the companion report <ref> [15] </ref> was implemented in C and executed on Sun4 Sparc machines. fl The computer retina program takes in as input a sequence of images which are then processed by the model. Several sets of outputs are produced, one for each of the retinal neuron layers. <p> outputs, the local variations in contrast are quite visible in all parts of the image. 25 computer retina periphery, a log-polar sampling scheme is used to model the nonuniform sampling occurring at the receptor level, as well as the convergence of information from the cones to the ganglion cell level <ref> [15] </ref>. The primate retina achieves tremendous data reduction through the use of a nonuniform sampling scheme that samples the image with coarser resolution with increasing retinal eccentricity. Further data reduction is realized by converging increasing numbers of cone inputs into ganglion cell outputs.

Reference-contexts: These outputs are compared to those recorded in fish retinas by Normann [10] and Werblin <ref> [19] </ref>. (bottom) when exposed to long (900 ms - 2 s) test flashes of various intensity at two different background intensities [10]. The Necturus cone recordings were made in an aspartate treated retina and thus were isolated from the effects of horizontal cell feedback [10]. <p> Figures 5 and 6 show the data for horizontal and midget bipolar cells, respectively, for flashed background experiments as performed on the cones. In this case, horizontal cell feedback to the cones was enabled to allow comparison of model cell outputs against those of non-aspartate treated mudpuppy retinas <ref> [19] </ref>. The model cell outputs are comparable to those of the mudpuppy but have a much sharper transient responses due to the shorter time constants used in the model cells. <p> The intensity of the substituted flash is indicated to the right of each curve in log trolands as in the cone experiment. The bottom figure shows horizontal cell recordings obtained by Werblin in the mudpuppy retina in a similar experiment <ref> [19] </ref>. Note that mudpuppy horizontal cells hyperpolarize in response to increased stimulation while computer retina horizontal cell outputs increase in response to increased stimulation. As a result, the polarity of the model horizontal cell response is the opposite of that of a mudpuppy horizontal cell. 12 4. <p> The intensity of the substituted flash is shown to the right of each curve in log trolands. The bottom figure shows recordings from a depolarizing bipolar cell in the mudpuppy retina obtained by Werblin in a similar experiment <ref> [19] </ref>. 13 The model midget bipolar cell has a dynamic range of approximately 1.5 log units while the diffuse bipolar cell has a very narrow 1.0 log unit response range around a given background intensity. <p> It is only at much brighter intensities that the model bipolar cells respond equally well to negative contrast as well as positive contrast. Figure 7 (bottom) shows the corresponding intensity-response curves obtained by Normann [10] and Werblin <ref> [19] </ref> in the Necturus (cone) and mudpuppy (horizontal and bipolar cell) retinas.
