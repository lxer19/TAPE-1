Abstract: An in-depth study has been conducted with the purpose of recommending a sensor actuator bus (SAB) interoperability standard for the semiconductor industry. One major result of this study is a well-defined process for analyzing and selecting a SAB for an industry. Components of this process include a requirements analysis survey, selection criteria derivation, SAB candidate identification, structured candidate presentations / tutorials, follow-up analysis and refinement of selection criteria, comparative weighted analysis of candidate solutions with respect to refined selection criteria, and SAB solution recommendation. The selection criteria derivation process was iterative and flexible; selection criteria were first compiled through analysis of survey responses, and updated prior to candidate presentations and again after candidate presentations. Candidate presentation review, follow-up analysis, selection criteria refinement, and comparative weighted analysis of candidate solutions was accomplished by multiple analysts, operating independently. Results from the analysts were reviewed and a consensus on a SAB interoperable standard recommendation was sought. A review of the process has revealed a number of valuable lessons learned that could be applied to future evaluation studies of this type.

Sensor / Actuator Bus Survey The initial step of the process following the kickoff meeting was the development and conducting of a Sensor/Actuator Bus Requirements Analysis Survey <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Topics were addressed both separately and in a comparative mode where appropriate to derive a prioritization of issues. A detailed discussion of the results of this survey are beyond the scope of this document <ref> [1] </ref>. However the following is a sample of survey results: 80% of sensor/actuator response time requirements were between 1 ms and 100 ms. <p> Performance / Speed / Determinism Results of the SAB analysis survey indicate that respondents view I/O response time as one of the most important communication performance requirements <ref> [1] </ref>. If a SAB does not meet response time requirements, it cannot be utilized, irregardless of its other qualifications. <p> controllers, the specification will be of little use to the industry as a whole.

The Process of Evaluation and Selection The need for utilization of SAB technology and acceptance of an interoperability standard for sensing systems is clearly indicated [21].

Reference-contexts: The Process of Evaluation and Selection The need for utilization of SAB technology and acceptance of an interoperability standard for sensing systems is clearly indicated <ref> [21] </ref>. Both SEMI and SEMATECH recognized this industry need and have subsequently pursued the identification and adoption of a interoperability standard for sensors / actuators / controllers for the industry [2, 3]. <p> A Project Technical Advisory Board (PTAB) was formed and a kickoff meeting was organized that brought together experts in interoperability standard development, SAB implementation, and SAB use, for open discussions <ref> [21] </ref>. One major conclusion resulting from that meeting was that, in order to effectively pursue an interoperability standard, a process had to be derived to govern the interoperability standard recommendation process. This process is depicted in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: An introduction to each candidate is provided in Section 2; a summary of information derived from the candidate presentations and subsequent follow-up is provided in [7, 9, 10, 4]. Additionally, two analysts were commissioned to aid in the selection process <ref> [22] </ref>.

Follow-up conversations were conducted with candidate representatives as necessary.

The output of each candidate was an in-depth analysis document and accompanying presentation <ref> [22, 9, 10] </ref>, that included the following key elements: An introduction section that identifies the benefits for having an interoperability SAB standard, motivates the need for the technical SAB presentation, and summarizes the technologies that will be analyzed.

Reference-contexts: A third analyst was commissioned to investigate SAB cost-of-ownership issues including development and implementation costs associated with the candidate solutions <ref> [23] </ref>. Following the candidate presentations, the two analysts used the presentation material along with the survey results and initial requirements specification to derive a more quantitative weighted selection criteria. Each candidate was then mapped into this set of criteria. Follow-up conversations were conducted with candidate representatives as necessary.

Reference-contexts: Thus issues to be considered in assessing availability include status of the standard, number of sources for components, software libraries and/or firmware, etc. Development and Implementation Cost One of the major benefits anticipated in SAB utilization is the reduction in cost-of-ownership of systems in which they are utilized <ref> [24] </ref>. However, it is important that the cost of development and implementation of a SAB not outweigh this cost-of-ownership improvement. There are a number of costs that must be considered. The most important of course is the typical SAB node cost, including the cost of a dumb slave node.

Specifically, there is an emerging literature base devoted to interoperability of SAB systems in the semiconductor manufacturing industry <ref> [2, 3, 4, 29] </ref>. However, it is important to note that the degree of SAB technology utilization and standardization for many industries is ahead of the semiconductor manufacturing industry.
