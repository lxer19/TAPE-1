Reference-contexts: Perfect zero-knowledge proofs are presented for Graph Isomorphism and its complement. 266 APPENDIX A. ANNOTATED LIST OF REFERENCES (COMPILED FEB. 1989) Readability: the full version is very detailed, sometimes to a point of exhausting the reader. A more elegant proof of the main result is sketched in <ref> [G89a] </ref>. [GMW87] Goldreich, O., S. Micali, and A. Wigderson, "How to Play any Mental Game", 19th STOC, 1987. A more reasonable version is available from me. <p> As demonstrated throughout the course, this simplifies both the statements and their proofs. An attempt to treat secure encryption and zero-knowledge in uniform complexity measures is reported in <ref> [G89a] </ref>. In fact, the lectures on secure encryption are based on [G89a]. <p> As demonstrated throughout the course, this simplifies both the statements and their proofs.

Reference-contexts: The fact that the inner-product mod 2 is a hard-core for any one-way function (of the form g (x; r) = (f (x); r)) was proven by Goldreich and Levin [GL89]. The proof presented in this book, which follows ideas originating in <ref> [ACGS84] </ref>, is due to Charles Rackoff. Hard-core predicates and functions for specific collections of permutations were suggested in [BM82,LW,K88,ACGS84,VV84]. Specifically, Kalisky [K88], extending ideas of [BM82,LW], proves that the intractability of various discrete logarithm problems yields hard-core functions for the related exponentiation permutations. Alexi el. al. [ACGS84], building on work by <p> follows ideas originating in <ref> [ACGS84] </ref>, is due to Charles Rackoff. Hard-core predicates and functions for specific collections of permutations were suggested in [BM82,LW,K88,ACGS84,VV84]. Specifically, Kalisky [K88], extending ideas of [BM82,LW], proves that the intractability of various discrete logarithm problems yields hard-core functions for the related exponentiation permutations. Alexi el. al. [ACGS84], building on work by Ben-Or et. al. [BCS83], prove that the intractability of factoring yields hard-core functions for permutations induced by squaring modulo a composite number. 2.7. MISCELLANEOUS 77 2.7.2 Suggestion for Further Reading Our exposition of the RSA and Rabin functions is quite sparse in details. <p> For further details consult the original work of Lagarias and Odlyzko [LO85] and the later survey of Brickell and Odlyzko [BO88]. For further details on hard-core functions for the RSA and Rabin functions the reader is directed to Alexi el. al. <ref> [ACGS84] </ref>. For further details on hard-core functions for the "DLP function" the reader is directed to Kalisky's work [K88]. 78 CHAPTER 2. COMPUTATIONAL DIFFICULTY The theory of average-case complexity, initiated by Levin [L84], is somewhat related to the notion of one-way functions. <p> The interested reader is thus referred to the original paper of Hastad et. al. [HILL] (which combines the results in [H90,ILL89]) and to Luby's book [L94book]. Simple pseudorandom generators based on specific intractability assumptions are presented in [BM82,BBS82,ACGS84,VV84,K88]. In particular, <ref> [ACGS84] </ref> presents pseudorandom generators based on the intractability of factoring, whereas [K88] presents pseudorandom generators based on the intractability of discrete logarithm problems. In both cases, the major step is the construction of hard-core predicates for the corresponding collections of one-way permutations.

Reference-contexts: The suggestion for basing one-way functions on the believed intractability of decoding random linear codes is taken from [BMT78,GKL88], and the suggestion to base one-way functions on the subset sum problem is taken from <ref> [IN89] </ref>. The equivalence of existence of weak and strong one-way functions is implicit in Yao's work [Y82]. The existence of universal one-way functions is stated in Levin's work [L85].

Proposition 3.3 presents a pair of ensembles which are computational indistinguishable although they are statistically far apart.

Consequently, Yao proved that the existence of any one-way permutation implies the existence of pseudorandom generators [Y82]. Yao was the first to characterize pseudorandom generators as producing sequences which are computationally indistinguishable from uniform.

Author's Note: NIZK suggestions An extremely efficient perfect zero-knowledge two-prover proof system for N P, appears in a paper by Dwork et. al. [DFKNS]. Specifically, only logarithmic randomness and communication complexities are required to get a constant error probability.

Reference-contexts: However, the hope did not materialize. Shamir presented an efficient algorithm for solving the subset-sum problem for instances with a hidden super increasing sequence <ref> [S82] </ref>. Another case for which the subset sum problem is known to be easy is the case of low density instances. <p> The constructions presented in Section 3.5 follow the ideas of [GKL88] and [ILL89]. These constructions make extensive use of universal 2 hashing functions, which were introduced by Carter and Wegman [CW] and first used in complexity theory by Sipser <ref> [S82] </ref>. Pseudorandom functions were introduced and investigated by Goldreich et. al. [GGM84]. In particular, the construction of pseudorandom functions based on pseudorandom generators is taken from [GGM84]. Pseudorandom permutations were defined and constructed by Luby and Rackoff [LR86], and our presentation follows their work.

Reference-contexts: This constitutes a contradiction to the hypothesis of the lemma, and hence the lemma follows. 2.7 Miscellaneous 2.7.1 Historical Notes The notion of a one-way function originates from the paper of Diffie and Hellman <ref> [DH76] </ref>. Weak one-way functions were introduced by Yao [Y82]. The RSA function was introduced by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman [RSA78], whereas squaring modulo a composite was introduced and studied by Rabin [R79].
