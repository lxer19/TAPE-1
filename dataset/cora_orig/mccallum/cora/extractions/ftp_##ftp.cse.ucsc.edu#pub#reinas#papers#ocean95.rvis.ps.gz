Abstract: This paper gives a brief system overview of REINAS (Realtime Environmental Information Network Analysis System) and some details on the instrumentation and visualization aspects. REINAS is a continuing engineering research and development system with the goal of designing, developing and testing an operational prototype system for data acquisition, data management, and visualization. As such, it includes a growing web of networked remote and in-situ instruments, a federated geographical database, and an extensible visualization interface. REINAS focuses on the needs of both oceanographers and meteorologists who monitor realtime data or analyze retrospective data that has been collected in the Monterey Bay area. This system is designed to be portable, extensible, and fault tolerant.

Reference-contexts: bird's eye view as well as the ability to zoom in an areas of interest, disaster control planners who need current measurements as well as models to compare the impact of various remedial alternatives, and finally a growing list of recreational users who are interested in the current surf, sail <ref> [5] </ref>, or ski conditions.

Reference-contexts: It allows users to explore large data sets interactively using different visualization techniques. It is also extensible and can easily grow with users' needs. The underlying mechanism that provides the visualization capability in analysis mode is based on spray rendering <ref> [6] </ref>. Spray rendering provides the users with the metaphor of spray painting their data sets as a means of visualizing them. In its simplest form, data are painted or rendered visible by the color of the paint particles.

Reference-contexts: Figure 5 shows the interfaces available in analysis mode as well as illustrate some of the possible visualization methods. Spray is similar to other modular visualization environments (MVE) like AVS, Explorer, Data-explorer, in terms of extensibility, modularity and drag and click interface <ref> [7] </ref>. Spray differs in terms of execution flow - active agents vs data-flow and finer granularity making it more flexible. Region Selector Originally, the design of the visualization component assumed that the physical scale of study would be comparable to the Monterey Bay.

Reference-contexts: Efforts were also made to make sure that the added flexibility does not sacrifice ease of use. The result is a visual programming extension to spray rendering that allows users to graphically create new sparts (and hence, new visualization methods) using a mix and match paradigm <ref> [8] </ref>. Sparts are created by hooking up different components. These components are organized into four categories. 1. Target components are functions that detect fea tures in the data set. 2. Visual components are functions that describe the graphical representation of the feature that was detected. 3.

Reference-contexts: can be obtained by multiple applications of several sparts. 3.2 Collaborative Visualization To facilitate the sharing of data and collaboration among science colleagues, we have also added a collaborative feature to the REINAS visualization system, enabling geographically distributed researchers to work within a shared virtual workspace and create visualization products <ref> [9] </ref>. There are several components that are needed to make this feasible: session manager, sharing data/cans, floor control, multiple window, audio/video support, and different collaboration/compression levels. The session manager is a piece of software that maintains a list of ongoing sessions and the participants in each session.

Reference-contexts: The "eye-con" shows the location of the other participant. 3.3 Visualization of Uncertainty Visualizations without any indication of data quality are often misleading and may lead to erroneous conclusions. We are investigating a variety of techniques that will visually present data together with its quality information <ref> [10] </ref>. A specific example is our work on uncertainty vector glyphs which indicate vector direction and magnitude as well as uncertainty in direction and magnitude, together with the median direction and length [11]. This work is particularly important with environmental data since measured environmental data have inherent uncertainty.

Radar, light, and sound are used to remotely sense physical phenomena, but because of instrument limitations the measurements are approximate.

Reference-contexts: The time series data has a wealth of information, which may be examined in detail, but is not used in the vector visualizations. Wind profilers have weak scattering from dry air, and measurements are also influenced by airplanes and migrating birds <ref> [12] </ref>. Ocean surface current radars have varying performance depending on the ocean conditions. Current methods of display simply threshold or ignore uncertain vector component measurements. Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the difference between traditional vector field plots and those using uncertainty glyphs.
