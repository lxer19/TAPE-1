Abstract: This paper describes a short-term survey and evaluation project that covered a large number of machine translation products and research. We discuss our evaluation approach and address certain issues and implications relevant to our findings. We represented a variety of potential users of MT systems and were faced with the task of identifying which systems would best help them solve their translation problems.
