Abstract: This paper describes the implementation of reflex action for the arm of the humanoid robot Cog [5]. A set of biologically inspired postural primitives are used to create the arm motion. The primitives are combined in different ways to achieve reaching with grasping and withdrawal reflexes, allowing the arm to interact safely with both objects and people. This paper describes the reflexes, the biological inspiration for the control, and includes data collected from the robot.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, this reflex system has been interfaced with the visual system getting targets for the arm motion from visual cues (Marjanovic [18]). The organization of the reflex network is shown in Figure 7. It is based on a subsumption architecture approach (Brooks <ref> [3] </ref>). The basic behavior is reaching, for which the target generator generates targets, which generate trajectories which move the arm. If the withdrawal reflex is initiated, from something touching the appropriate sensor, a new trajectory is planned to return the arm to the rest position.

Reference-contexts: The trajectories are communicated by dpram to the communication 68332 and from there to the individual joint controllers. One final 68332 manages communication from the 68332s to a front end Macintosh computer. The 68332s are programmed in L <ref> [4] </ref>, a subset of Common LISP. This overall system architecture was chosen for Cog's brain to allow local functionality, but wide ranging communication between different parts of the brain.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The humanoid robot Cog <ref> [5] </ref> is intended to explore its environment using its body. There are many possible ways for Cog's arms to perform this role, and this paper describes the first stage|reaching with reflexes. This allows the arm to move around safely and interact with objects and people.

Reference-contexts: There is a considerable amount of biological evidence for the spring-like behaviour of muscles (See Zajac [33] for review) and also for the spring/damper-like behaviour of individual joints (Cannon and Zahalak <ref> [6] </ref>, MacKay et al. [17]). There is evidence that joints act like springs of constant stiffness, from measurements of the end-point impedance of human arms (Mussa-Ivaldi [24]).

Reference-contexts: This seems to be independent of the region of the workspace (Morasso [20], Flash and Hogan [12], Hollerbach and Flash [15]). Slow movements do tend to be more curved however (Cruse and Bruwer <ref> [7] </ref>). There has been much argument about whether these motions are planned in Cartesian space, using an optimization such as minimum jerk (Nel-son [26]), or in joint space using minimum joint torque change (Uno et al [31]).

Reference-contexts: Other workers have suggested the use of hierarchical controllers and primitives for whole arm motion (Deno et al. <ref> [8] </ref>, Nelson et al. [25]). The approach taken in this paper differs in that the sensory information is used to affect the overall behavior of the arm, not just modulating the planned motion of the robot end-effector.

Reference-contexts: An alternative model is that the segmentation is an artifact of the interaction between the change in the target position and the limb characteristics (Flanagan et al. <ref> [10] </ref>). For Cog's arms, the motion is implemented by changing the set-points of the joints using a smooth minimum jerk profile (Nelson [26]).

Reference-contexts: Independent of what is the exact criterion, it is clear that humans move their arms smoothly. Whenever a reflex action is initiated, the target of the arm motion changes. When humans move between a number of targets (Flash <ref> [11] </ref>, Flash and Henis [12]), or make a movement that requires precision (Milner [19]), they still exhibit smooth profiles, but seem to use a number of discrete smooth movements, rather than continuous motion. This has also been observed in infants (Hof-sten [32]). <p> The new motion is from the old target to the new target, and does not require knowledge of the arm position. This is illustrated in Figure 4. The velocity trace is qualitatively similar to those presented in <ref> [11, 12, 19] </ref>. Since the interpolation is carried out in joint space, the end-point of the arm does not travel in a straight line in Cartesian space.

Reference-contexts: Humans when performing reaching tasks tend to move the ends of their arms in roughly straight lines, with remarkably consistent bell-shaped velocity profiles. This seems to be independent of the region of the workspace (Morasso [20], Flash and Hogan <ref> [12] </ref>, Hollerbach and Flash [15]).

This has also been observed in infants (Hof-sten [32]). <p> This has also been observed in infants (Hof-sten [32]). One conclusion is that the trajectories are summed, so that the actual motion is the sum of the old motion and the motion needed to get from the old target to the new one (Flash <ref> [12] </ref>).

[10]). <p> The new motion is from the old target to the new target, and does not require knowledge of the arm position. This is illustrated in Figure 4.

Reference-contexts: Experiments by Bizzi and others (Bizzi [2], Giszter <ref> [13] </ref>, Mussa-Ivaldi [23], and Loeb [16]) have attempted to elucidate this hierarchy. They electrically stimulated the spinal cords of frogs and rats and measured the forces obtained at the leg, mapping out a force field in leg-motion space. This is shown in Figure 2. <p> This is shown in Figure 2. Surprisingly they found that the fields were generally convergent (with a single equilibrium point) and uniform across different frogs. The idea is that if the leg is free to move, it will move to the center of the field, see Giszter <ref> [13] </ref>. Different fields therefore correspond to different postures of the leg in space. They have found only a small number of fields (4 in total), which correspond to postures either at the extremes of the workspace or to postures involved in reflex actions (such as wiping the legs against one-another).

Reference-contexts: There is evidence that joints act like springs of constant stiffness, from measurements of the end-point impedance of human arms (Mussa-Ivaldi [24]). By changing the stiffness of the various muscles, the impedance (springi-ness) of the hand can be changed which may help to perform different tasks (Hogan <ref> [14] </ref>). In an attempt to mimic this, the actuators of Cog's arm behave as if they are springs of variable spring-rate and damping. Motion is achieved by changing the rest or equilibrium position of the springs set as detailed in Figure 1.

The force fields remain of similar shape even after the frog is deaf-ferented (Loeb <ref> [16] </ref>), which strongly suggests that the fields are caused by the interaction of the constant (there is no sensory feedback) spring-like properties of the muscles and the leg kinematics. These findings lead the researchers to suggest that these fields are primitives that are combined to obtain leg motion.

Reference-contexts: The position of the end of the arm is generally given by the forward kinematics (see any robotics textbook such as Paul <ref> [28] </ref>). This relates the position of the end of the arm ~ X to the joint angles . ~ X = L () Cog's arm is springy, so the actual joint angles are not the same as the set-point or equilibrium angles. <p> The complexity of this mapping can be greatly affected by particular choice of primitive vectors. The force field ~ F from a particular choice of posture is obtained by considering t = J T ~ F , (see Paul <ref> [28] </ref>) and is given by the solution of J () ~ F = K joint ( set) where J () is the Jacobian from joint angles to Cartesian coordinates.

Reference-contexts: It has 6 degrees of freedom, each powered by a DC electric motor with a series spring (Series Elastic Actuator, see Pratt and Williamson <ref> [29] </ref>). The spring is used to give good force control at the joint, and to protect the motor gearbox from shock loading. At the end of the arm is mounted a simple claw, which has touch sensors to detect when the arm is touched.

One conclusion is that the trajectories are summed, so that the actual motion is the sum of the old motion and the motion needed to get from the old target to the new one (Flash [12]). <p> This is an area where further work is needed. It is interesting that the "straightness" of infant reaches increases, as they grow older (Hofsten <ref> [32] </ref>). The first move was from 0 to 1, then another move was added to 1.5. The top trace shows the two individual positions, and the dotted trace shows the actual motion.

Reference-contexts: There is a considerable amount of biological evidence for the spring-like behaviour of muscles (See Zajac <ref> [33] </ref> for review) and also for the spring/damper-like behaviour of individual joints (Cannon and Zahalak [6], MacKay et al. [17]). There is evidence that joints act like springs of constant stiffness, from measurements of the end-point impedance of human arms (Mussa-Ivaldi [24]).
