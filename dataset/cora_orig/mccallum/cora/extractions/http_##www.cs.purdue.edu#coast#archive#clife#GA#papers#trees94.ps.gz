Abstract: We consider the problem of representing trees (undirected, cycle-free graphs) in Genetic Algorithms. This problem arises, among other places, in the solution of network design problems. After comparing several commonly used representations based on their usefulness in genetic algorithms, we describe a new representation and show it to be superior in almost all respects to the others. In particular, we show that our representation covers the entire space of solutions, produces only viable offspring, and possesses locality, all necessary features for the effective use of a genetic algorithm. We also show that the representation will reliably produce very good, if not optimal, solutions even when the problem definition is changed.

Reference-contexts: Sometimes the problem specification fixes the identity of the root. Other times its selection is part of the problem. In all cases, it is possible to represent an arbitrary tree as a rooted tree if we so desire. We will do so here. It has been shown <ref> [1] </ref> that the number of possible trees in a complete graph on N nodes is N (N2) . Since each such tree can correspond to N possible rooted trees, with any node designated as the root, there are thus N (N1) possible rooted trees. <p> The cost matrix would be biased by these values using C 0 The tree that the chromosome represents is then found by applying Prim's algorithm <ref> [1] </ref> to find a minimal spanning tree (MST) over the nodes using the biased cost matrix. Finally, this MST is evaluated using the original cost matrix to determine the tree's fitness for the OCSTP.

Reference-contexts: This is an improvement over the characteristic vector representation. Thus, we see that, at least for complete graphs, this representation is significantly better than the one above. For sparse graphs, however, the improvement diminishes. C. Prufer Numbers A third possible encoding is the Prufer number <ref> [5] </ref> associated with a tree, defined as follows. Let T be a tree on N nodes. The Prufer number, P (T ), is an N 2 "digit" number, where once again the digits are numbers between 1 and N and are defined by the following algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Recent work by Orvosh and Davis <ref> [6] </ref> indicates that when an encoding allows invalid chromosomes to be produced by mating, it isn't always best to "repair" them. They suggest that this reparation process can result in the loss of important genetic material and, thus, reduce the efficiency of the search.

Reference-contexts: Our first representation was based on permutations of predecessor vectors and was rather elegant, but we eventually found it to have little locality and a genetic algorithm using it performed poorly <ref> [7] </ref>. Our second representation applied evolving edge and node weights to drive the genetic algorithm towards a solution. This latter representation proved to be far superior to any we had used before in all respects. <p> B. Heuristic algorithm comparison Since optimal solutions to the OCSTP are not generally known, we compared our genetic algorithm with a good heuristic that has been used for the OCSTP in the past <ref> [7] </ref>. <p> and the genetic algorithm on the modified problem are shown below: Heuristic 3; 210; 004 LN B GA 2; 367; 504 (optimum) Due to the much simplified traffic patterns in the modified problem, we were able to prove that the LNB genetic algorithm was, in fact, finding the optimal solution <ref> [7] </ref>. VI. Conclusions and Future Work We believe that we have defined a representation which satisfies most of the criteria given in section II. and which can be used effectively to represent trees within a GA.
