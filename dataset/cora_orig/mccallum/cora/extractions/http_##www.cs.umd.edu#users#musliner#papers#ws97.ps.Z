Abstract: To an increasing extent, large-scale information processing is a distributed phenomenon. As the trend in computing moves further towards distributed networks of powerful workstations and information servers, we see the growing importance of solutions to dynamic distributed scheduling problems. In these domains, resource providers are distributed both geographically and bureaucratically, so that no central authority can dictate a global schedule. Resource consumers are also distributed: tasks arrive at different locations according to arrival functions that are at best stochastically predictable. In this paper, we describe a distributed constraint-based scheduling system that adjusts task distribution and execution times through the negotiation of contracts, using a refinement of the Contract Net protocol. By combining the minimal-commitment capabilities of constraint-based scheduling with the distributed coordination features of contracting, this system responds flexibly to dynamic variations in load balance and unpredictable task arrivals. Large-scale simulations show significant performance benefits to using powerful scheduling methods in the determination of contract negotiation bids. These results can be used to improve the performance of distributed computing systems cooperating to process large-scale shareable tasks.

Reference-contexts: tasks in a distributed system in particular, are both very broad research topics, addressed using a wide variety of approaches in fields ranging from management science, to AI, to operations research, to work 3 This parallels results from other problem-solving domains (e.g., Barrett and Weld's results on partial order planning <ref> (Barrett & Weld 1994) </ref>). on distributed operating systems. Our concerns in this paper are somewhat narrower. We are specifically interested in problems involving the allocation of computing resources to individual tasks, where allocation decisions must be made locally.

Reference-contexts: Constraint-Based Scheduling Each DAAC agent maintains its own schedule of tasks using constraint envelope scheduling, in which schedules are constructed by a process of "iterative refinement" <ref> (Boddy, Carciofini, & Hadden 1992) </ref>. Scheduling decisions correspond to constraining an activity either with respect to another activity or with respect to some timeline. The schedule becomes more detailed as activities and constraints are added.

Reference-contexts: The EOS Data and Information System (EOSDIS) will be responsible for archiving and analyzing the resulting vast amounts of data. EOSDIS functions include managing mission information, archiving and distributing data, and generating and disseminating scientific data products <ref> (Dozier & Ramapriyan 1990) </ref>. Both raw data and the results of analyzing that data will be stored in archives maintained by a set of Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs).

Reference-contexts: As illustrated by the simulation results discussed in Section , a balanced load may actually be antithetical to maximal system-wide net value. In this paper, we describe a distributed scheduling system that adjusts task distribution through the negotiation of contracts, using a refinement of the Contract Net protocol <ref> (SMITH 1980) </ref> similar to Sand-holm's (Sandholm 1992; 1993). The behavior of this system is investigated through experiments conducted in a simulated domain implementing a simplification of a distributed image processing application for NASA's Earth Observing System. Large-scale simulations have revealed several interesting behavioral aspects of the system. <p> Contract-Based Negotiation Negotiation over formal and informal contracts is a longstanding societal mechanism for establishing commitments between agents. Not surprisingly, contract-based negotiation is also a popular paradigm in distributed AI and distributed problem-solving research. Early work by Smith <ref> (SMITH 1980) </ref> described the Contract Net system of distributed processing agents based on contract negotiation.

Reference-contexts: Bidding in pure load balancing is trivial; in our domain, high-quality bidding appears to be the key to high performance. Market-based approaches such as Wellman's Wal-ras <ref> (Wellman 1993) </ref> are difficult to apply to our domain because of the focus on scheduling individual tasks, and the relatively large size and small number of those tasks.
