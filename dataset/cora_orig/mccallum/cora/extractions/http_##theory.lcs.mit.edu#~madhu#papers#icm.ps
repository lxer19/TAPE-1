Abstract: Recent research in the theory of computing has led to the following intriguing result. "There exists a probabilistic verifier for proofs of mathematical assertions that looks at a proof in only a constant number of bit positions and satisfies the following properties: (Completeness) For every valid theorem there exists a proof that is always accepted. (Soundness) For invalid assertions every purported proof is rejected with some positive probability that is independent of the length of the theorem or proof." This result sheds insight into the fundamental complexity class NP and shows that it is equivalent to a seemingly smaller class of languages with efficient probabilistically checkable proofs. This result is especially significant to combinatorial optimization. For many combinatorial optimization problems it demonstrates that the task of finding even nearly-optimal solutions is computationally intractable. In this article we describe some methods used to construct such verifiers.

The traditional connection between proofs and optimization <ref> [15, 29, 32] </ref> now indicates that for some optimization problems (unfortunately, not necessarily natural ones) finding near-optimal solutions should be as hard as finding optimal ones. The statement can actually be formalized and made applicable even to natural optimization problems.

Reference-contexts: In particular, a number of new optimization problems have been related to PCPs and sharp results obtained in [33, 3, 21, 18, 26, 39]. Detailed surveys of such connections are available in [4, 17]. The connections have also motivated some new systematic study of combinatorial optimization problems | see <ref> [16, 31, 30] </ref>. The renewed interest in the approximability of optimization problems has also resulted, surprisingly, in a new spurt in algorithmic results. Particularly striking results in this direction are [24, 2].

Reference-contexts: A purported theorem T and proof are then just a sequence of bits; proves T if the verifier accepts the pair (T; ). The purported theorem T is true if such a proof exists. The class NP <ref> [15, 32] </ref> represents the class of all theorems with "short" proofs; and allows for very simple combinatorial descriptions of theorems and proofs. As an example, we describe the problem 3-SAT. <p> Thus the task of finding an approximately correct proof is as hard as the task of finding a perfectly correct proof. The traditional connection between proofs and optimization <ref> [15, 29, 32] </ref> now indicates that for some optimization problems (unfortunately, not necessarily natural ones) finding near-optimal solutions should be as hard as finding optimal ones. The statement can actually be formalized and made applicable even to natural optimization problems.

Reference-contexts: The statement can actually be formalized and made applicable even to natural optimization problems. This connection was discovered by [19] and its applicability was further extended in [5] to apply to a large number of optimization problems considered in <ref> [34] </ref>. In this article we describe some of the methods used in the construction of probabilistically checkable proofs, from a very high level. In particular, we describe some of the properties that a probabilistically checkable proof must have. We also give a hint of how such properties are effected.

Reference-contexts: The interested reader may read the original papers for further details. Additional details may be found in [1, 38]. Subsequently there has been a significant amount of work improving the constant q of Theorem 1. This quest was initiated in [13] and further pursued in <ref> [20, 14, 35, 12] </ref>. Recently, a surprisingly sharp result, essentially showing q = 3, has been obtained by [27] (see also [23] for a variant of this result).
