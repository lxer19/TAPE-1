Abstract: Two well known LTI approximation methods balanced truncation and optimal Hankel norm approximation are extended to the LPV framework. Quadratic stability of the approximants and generalisations of the known LTI error bounds are examined. The concept of the graph operator of an LPV system is discussed. We show how, by approximating the graph operator, the state-dimension of models which are not quadratically stable may be reduced. Techniques for solving the necessary linear matrix inequalities are considered, and an example presented.

Reference-contexts: Hence it is important that the state-dimension be kept as low as possible. This motivates the development of approximation techniques for LPV models. In the sequel we introduce the concept of a balanced LPV model, and study those approximation techniques which rely on system balancing namely balanced truncation <ref> [16, 7] </ref> and optimal Hankel norm approximation [12]. We demonstrate that many, although by no means all, of the concepts from approximation of LTI systems carry over into the LPV framework. For LPV model approximation we see that it is possible to bound the approximation error from above. <p> In the case of LTI systems it is well known that there is an upper bound on the truncation error which is tight and actually achieved at DC when only one state is truncated <ref> [7] </ref>. It has been observed that in the general case where more than one state is truncated the maximum approximation error resulting from balanced truncation occurs at low frequency. <p> Of course parameter--varying systems do not have a frequency response but we can still draw on intuition gained from LTI systems in order to improve the approximation for the purpose of control design. In this regard the frequency-weighted technique introduced by Enns <ref> [7] </ref> proves particularly useful since it can be regarded as weighting (or filtering) the signal space to emphasise particular frequency regions. In this section we will examine this frequency-weighted approximation technique and show how it extends very naturally to the LPV case.

A drawback of LPV controller synthesis is that the computational requirements increase rapidly as a function of the state-dimension [3], even more so than for LTI controller synthesis. Hence it is important that the state-dimension be kept as low as possible. <p> Here we'll consider an LPV model and controller. The model we will use has previously been studied by Gahinet et al. <ref> [10] </ref> for the synthesis of LPV controllers of state-dimension equal to the weighted model. The parameter dependent model is given by, P = 6 4 M ff 0 1 0 1 0 7 5 where Z ff and M ff are aerodynamic co-efficients which depend on v, H and ff. <p> = s + 0:201 96:78s 3 + 0:29s 2 + 0:0003s 0:0039 18 the performance specification corresponds to designing a controller which achieves, fl fl W 1 (I + P K ) 1 fl fl 1 A methodology for synthesis of LPV controllers satisfying equation (21) may be found in <ref> [3, 6, 10] </ref>.

Starting with the controller designed by Gahinet et al <ref> [10] </ref> (which we will call K 0 ) we now examine the effectiveness of the proposed LPV model approximation techniques for synthesis of satisfactory reduced order LPV controllers. The approach we take is to reduce K 0 then a posteriori check the performance of the reduced order controller. <p> The step response for each of these LTI plants was then calculated and plotted. There is no appreciable difference between the responses obtained using any of the three controllers and the settling time is well below the target figure of half a second. As in <ref> [10] </ref> we then chose the particular spiral parameter trajectory, Z ff = 2:25 + 1:70e 4t cos (100t) to test the closed loop performance. This trajectory is shown in Figure 2. The controller's state-space data were constructed using a convex interpolation of their values at the four vertices.

Reference-contexts: Of course any coprime factorisation would suffice but we will concentrate on what we call a contractive coprime factorisation (CCF). This is analogous to the normalised coprime factorisation of LTI systems and its extension to LTV systems in <ref> [19] </ref>. For LPV systems we cannot satisfy a normalisation condition for all feasible parameter trajectories, hence the notion of a contractive coprime factorisation. There is a nice duality between the Gramians of a CCF and the solutions of certain Riccati inequalities.
