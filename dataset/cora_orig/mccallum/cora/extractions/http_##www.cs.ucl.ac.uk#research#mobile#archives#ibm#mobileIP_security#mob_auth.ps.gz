Abstract: Internetworks of the future will allow and promote universal access. Network users will be able to access the network at a multitude of access points separated by significant geographic distance and many administrative boundaries. Lacking a single central authority, a new set of inter-domain security mechanisms is needed to allow users to migrate into remote domains while inheriting privileges from their home domain. Solutions addressing this issue must take into account a somewhat contradictory security constraint that calls for strict separation of security domains in order to avoid sharing sensitive security information among them. In this paper, we propose a solution for authenticating mobile users in remote domains that maintains the domain separation property. The protocols described herein can be applied in different mobile-user environments including wireless networks and mobile user services on traditional wireline networks.

Reference-contexts: In addition, some usability concerns are taken into account in order to offer a transparent user interface in remote domains. 4.1 Initial Assumptions When accessing the network in the home domain, the user is authenticated with a traditional server-based authentication mechanism such as Kerberos <ref> [3] </ref> or KryptoKnight [4]. Users of every network domain are registered with that domain's Authentication Server (AS). The AS of a domain can be replicated or partitioned within the domain but the set of all partitioned and duplicated ASs represent a single domain-level authority.

The reason for choosing KryptoKnight is twofold: * The existing KryptoKnight protocols have a number of qualities that make them attractive to build on. <p> As described in the next section, elements of both mutual and one-way protocols are used in the design of the mobile user authentication protocol. 5 Refer to <ref> [4] </ref> and [18] for details. 6 All encryption is performed with K ab . 6 A B &gt; 4.4 Basic Protocol The basic protocol is depicted in figure 4. <p> All ticket fields appear in cleartext with the exception of the key, which is secured within a key token. A KryptoKnight-style key token <ref> [4] </ref>, in turn, is computed as: AU T H K rh (N r ; N h ; U ) L K ur . This construction insures that the key is protected from unauthorized disclosure.

Reference-contexts: AU T H K ab denotes an authentication expression based on the shared key K ab . It is always generated A B &gt; &lt; &gt; by the responding party (B in our case). This expression is computed with a strong encryption function E, such as DES <ref> [5] </ref>, using K ab as the encryption key and over three inputs: two nonces generated by each party and the name of the message originator. <p> by user or by the access device on user's behalf * T u Timestamp issued by the user or by the access device on his behalf * N 1 r Nonce generated by AS r * AU T H K (X; Y; Z) Authentication token computed (e.g., using DES-based MAC <ref> [5] </ref>) over a tuple (X; Y; Z), under key K. * T ICK ^ K (A; K ; B; C) A ticket (i.e., a certificate) issued by A, sealed with the key ^ K, containing a secret quantity (typically, a key) K to be used by B for communicating with C.

Reference-contexts: This can not be accomplished without some interaction (perhaps, not direct) with the user's home domain, since only the home domain is able to comment on the user's current standing.

Certificates can be still used for identifying users. It is the authorization of users that can not be solved with certificates alone.

Reference-contexts: User authentication involving a Mobile Data Intermediate System (MD-IS) must refer to the local Authentication Server. However, even though CDPD provides a detailed description and packet formats for inter-domain location update (see Mobile Network Location Protocol, <ref> [13] </ref> sections 500-501), no details as to the format of authentication information are provided. 4 Authentication of Mobile Users In this section we present a solution for the authentication of mobile users.

Reference-contexts: Another problem with using certificates (both public- and shared-key based) is the implied assumption that a user has some means of carrying a certificate, e.g., within a cellular phone, a personal communicator or a smartcard. However, in the simplest mobile-user environment (e.g., UPT <ref> [14] </ref>), a user is "armed" with only a password or a PIN|something that a human brain can easily retain. <p> It will provide universal user access and will support both fixed and mobile end-systems. The UPT design anticipates many types of fraudulent use and suggests some general solutions ranging from simple PIN-based authentication to more involved two-way authentication (user$UPT-equipment) using smartcards <ref> [14, 15] </ref>. However, unlike GSM, UPT has not matured to a state where specific security solutions have been proposed. Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD)[13] architecture has been developed by a consortium of (mostly, US) companies. Like UPT, it envisions a network accessible through either mobile or fixed end-systems.

Reference-contexts: Like UPT, it envisions a network accessible through either mobile or fixed end-systems. However, instead of being a value-add service, it is a complete architecture encompassing, among other things, a complete MAC layer. The architecture supports several network layer protocols including IP [17] and CLNP <ref> [16] </ref>. CDPD specifications are not as vague as UPT about security requirements. In particular, CDPD requires a logically-separate entity, Authentication Server to be present in every service provider's domain. User authentication involving a Mobile Data Intermediate System (MD-IS) must refer to the local Authentication Server.

Reference-contexts: There are many ways of constructing K ur in a manner that makes it dependent on the user's current location. For example, K ur can be computed as E K u [F (AS r ; U )] where F is a strong one-way hash function such as MD5 <ref> [19] </ref>. We can even avoid using encryption by computing K ur as F (AS r ; U; K u ).

Reference-contexts: However, in the simplest mobile-user environment (e.g., UPT [14]), a user is "armed" with only a password or a PIN|something that a human brain can easily retain. Even if the user's ability to pay for services can be confirmed without contacting the home domain (e.g., with electronic cash <ref> [20, 21] </ref>), there remain two unsolved issues: tracking and access control. A user is normally registered with a home domain on a long-term basis; anyone wanting to contact a certain user will have to consult his home domain first.
