Abstract: b) A miner is trapped in a mine containing 3 doors. The first door leads to a tunnel that takes him to safety after 2 hours of travel. The second and third doors lead to tunnels that return him to the mine after 3 and 5 hours of travel respectively. Assume that the miner is equally likely to choose all doors at any time. Find the mean of X, the total time the miner spends in the mine before returning to safety. (hint: E(E[XjY ]) = E(X))
