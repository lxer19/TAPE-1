Abstract: A fuzzy logic approach for the online grasp-force - adaptation, which can be used for the control of fine manipulating with a multifingered robot hand, will be pre sented in this paper. The kernel of this approach consists of decision making logic which ex - presses the a-priory knowledge about the force beha - viour in side the friction cones and the ne ces sary reactions, re garding the criterion for grip stability. For the soft ware realisation of the fuzzy control ap proach a Fuzzy-C Development Sy stem supporting the en - tire de velop ment process was used. Two corresponding fuz zy cont rollers have been designed: A finger control ler and a grasp cont roller. During fine manipu lations of an object the fuz zy controller interacts with an underlying con ventional controller that receives, after defuz zyfica tion, the adapted force values which were applied. A com puter based simulation system was developed to analyse the capabilities of the desi gned fuzzy controllers.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Intelligent multifingered grippers are used for auto - nomously performing assembly tasks, like the peg-in-hole insertion. For the successful completion of such tasks a suitable controller is needed due to un - certainties. In spite of intensive research works on autonomous assembly and insertion tasks <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>, there exists no general solution for these problems. One reason for this is that the tolerances of the ob - jects, which have to be assembled in industry, are stricter than the accuracy of the used robot grip pers.

Reference-contexts: New research on friction compensation is pre - sently in progress. The simple coulomb-friction-compensation should be improved by the considera - tion of all friction parts shown in the Stribeck-curve. The refore fuzzy logic will also be an appropriate so - lution approach <ref> [4] </ref>. We have been used the ideas of the fuzzy logic referring to an un der standing of the physi cal laws that describe the dynamic behaviour of grasp forces.

Reference-contexts: Development of the Fuzzy Controller To model the grasp force behaviour during object manipulations a reaction-force simulator had to be used. This reaction-force simulator is based on the work of Whitney <ref> [5, 6] </ref> and considers one-point-con - tact as well as two-point-contact of the peg and the hole. It successively lowers the peg into the hole and determines the new position of the peg.

Reference-contexts: The control strategy of the grasp controller is that the resultant force in the contact point must lie inside the friction cone and DN has not become to big. The simulated results of the fuzzy controller show their performance in handling the uncer tainties of the peg-in-hole task <ref> [7] </ref>. The graphical visualisation of this task displaying the finger forces inside the fric tion cones are shown in Figure 4: Fig. 4: Simulation of a peg-in-hole insertion A comparison of the two designed controllers is shown in Table 1.
