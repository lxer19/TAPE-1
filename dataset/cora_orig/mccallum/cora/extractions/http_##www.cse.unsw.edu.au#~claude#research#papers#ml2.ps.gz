Abstract: Tw o important issues in machine learning are explored: the role that memory plays in acquiring new concepts; and the extent to which the learner can take an active part in acquiring these concepts. This chapter describes a program, called Marvin, which uses concepts it has learned previously to learn new concepts. The program forms hypotheses about the concept being learned and tests the hypotheses by asking the trainer questions. Learning begins when the trainer shows Marvin an example of the concept to be learned. The program determines which objects in the example belong to concepts stored in the memory. A description of the new concept is formed by using the information obtained from the memory to generalize the description of the training example. The generalized description is tested when the program constructs new examples and shows these to the trainer, asking if they belong to the target concept.

Reference-contexts: The search space is determined by the language used to describe concepts. Learning systems such as LEX (Mitchell, 1982), INDUCE (Michalski, 1983) and MIS (Shapiro, 1981), have languages which are fixed at the start of the learning task. In programs such as Marvin (Sammut, 1981) and its predecessor, CONFUCIUS <ref> (Cohen, 1978) </ref> we have inv estigated learning systems in which the description language changes depending on the state, i.e. on the set of descriptions learned.

Reference-contexts: The problem of learning is to search through the space with a sequence of generalizations until a path to the goal is found. The search space is determined by the language used to describe concepts. Learning systems such as LEX (Mitchell, 1982), INDUCE <ref> (Michalski, 1983) </ref> and MIS (Shapiro, 1981), have languages which are fixed at the start of the learning task.

Reference-contexts: This description is expanded, or elaborated, by finding those clauses stored in memory whose right hand sides match a subset of C. The left hand sides of the clauses are added to C to form C. The pattern matcher uses a simple unification procedure <ref> (Robinson, 1965) </ref> to construct substitutions for the variables in the clause. The effect of this elaboration is to augment the description of the example using the knowledge that Marvin has acquired previously. When predicate (8) was added to C, it enabled Marvin to find more matches in memory.

Reference-contexts: Since the concepts are disjunctive, the concepts can be taught in steps. One concept is partially learned, then part of the second and then the description of the first concept can be completed <ref> (Sammut, 1981) </ref>. discusses this problem more fully. A more difficult language recognition problem which Marvin has learned is that posed by Hayes-Roth and McDermott (1977). <p> The search space is determined by the language used to describe concepts.
