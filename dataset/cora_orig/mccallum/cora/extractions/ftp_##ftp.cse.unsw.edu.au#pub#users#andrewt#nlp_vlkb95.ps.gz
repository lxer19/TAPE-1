Title: Extracting Knowledge from Biological Descriptions  
Author: Andrew Taylor 
Address: Sydney, Australia  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science and Engineering University of New South Wales  
Abstract: We describe a system which performs biological identification on the basis of natural language descriptions. The system parses texts containing large sets of biological descriptions in restricted natural language and constructs a knowledge base. The system can semi-automatically adapt to a text by extending its lexicon and perhaps its grammar. The constructed knowledge bases are used to perform interactive identification of specimens. The system automatically constructs HTML forms to provide a World Wide Web identification interface which can be integrated with hypermedia resources. We describe the system's implementation and its performance on two large botany texts.

Reference-contexts: We believe our eventual interface will be a hybrid of all three approaches but so far integrating them has proved troublesome. We have implemented a natural language-based interface and a menu-based interface as HTML forms <ref> [1] </ref>. This allows identification of euca-lypts using information extracted from [9] to be conducted via the World Wide Web [3]. Both interfaces display the current candidate set as hypertext links to an HTML version of the source text.

Reference-contexts: In upcoming work we will build an identification system for amphipods (small crustaceans) based on <ref> [2] </ref>. The small degree of lexical overlap between this and our current texts and the grammatical differences should provide an interesting test of the generality of our methods. 13 Acknowledgements I would like to thank Gwen Harden and the Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney for their vital cooperation.

Reference-contexts: We have implemented a natural language-based interface and a menu-based interface as HTML forms [1]. This allows identification of euca-lypts using information extracted from [9] to be conducted via the World Wide Web <ref> [3] </ref>. Both interfaces display the current candidate set as hypertext links to an HTML version of the source text. Thus by clicking on a candidate taxon's name, the user can see the description of the species from the text complete with figures and links to distribution maps.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps more importantly it is also dealing successfully with taxa of far more disparate character than any computer-based identification system we are aware of. 11 Implementation 3,000 lines of SICStus Prolog <ref> [4] </ref> make up almost the entirety of our system. Apart from the Prolog, 120 lines of Tcl are used to implement an X interface and a number of small shell scripts are used in the initial processing of texts and as wrappers for the HTML-based interfaces.

Reference-contexts: The great taxonomist Lin-naeus [15] gave these trees the name keys by which biologists have known them since. The key as a method of identification was fully realised in Lamarck's Flora Francoise [14]. The modern key in Figure 1 (paraphrased from <ref> [5] </ref>) differs little from the keys Lamarck constructed two centuries ago. Not surprisingly given their long and widespread use, keys are effective tools but they have weaknesses. Some of the decision questions may be unanswerable for a particular specimen.

Reference-contexts: Apart from the Prolog, 120 lines of Tcl are used to implement an X interface and a number of small shell scripts are used in the initial processing of texts and as wrappers for the HTML-based interfaces. Many think that Prolog is well-suited for natural language parsing applications <ref> [6] </ref>. This also proved to be very much so in our case. Not only was the top-down backtracking approach of DCGs a comfortable formalism for our main grammar but their reversibil-ity proved very useful when extending the lexicon automatically.

Reference-contexts: Un--fortunately all of these were expensive to produce and most suffered from a degree of clumsiness. The arrival of computers brought a much more suitable medium which was quickly employed in the development of identification systems such as [12]. The most successful of current computer-based identification systems is DELTA <ref> [7] </ref>. The heart of DELTA is a language into which taxonomic descriptions must be encoded to use the system. One of the components of DELTA is INTKEY, an interactive identification program which given a set of descriptions in DELTA format can efficiently and flexibly perform identifications.

Reference-contexts: Thirdly we use statistical information for unknown words which occur a sufficient number of times. This is done by extracting bigrams from the text and looking for known words which have similar associations <ref> [8] </ref>. As yet the error rates on classification of unknown words using the above three methods is too high for the classifications to be used without manual checking, nonetheless they are useful. More useful and unfortunately more difficult is automatically or semi-automatically adding grammar rules to improve the grammar's coverage.
Reference: 9. <institution> Flora of Australia Volume 19, Myrtaceae, Eucalyptus, Angophora, Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra, </institution> <year> 1988. </year>
Reference-contexts: There is a corresponding variety in the nature of the descriptions. This is compounded by the text having over twenty authors. The Flora of Australia Volume 19 <ref> [9] </ref> is a 540 page volume describing the almost 600 species in the genera Eucalyptus and Angophera. In contrast to the previous text the species described are closely related and quite similar and there is a single main author. <p> Thus raw statistics of sentence coverage which could be easily gathered are not useful. Our manually constructed parser extracted from [13] 100,000 character/state pairs and 20,000 character/state pairs from <ref> [9] </ref>. Unfortunately we have no way to estimate how many character/state pairs are present in the text. Our only useful assessment method is manual examination of randomly sampled taxa. <p> Unfortunately it also can produce a very crowded interface. The diversity of the species described in [13] and the resulting number of characters and states make it difficult to provide such an interface. The much more homogeneous descriptions of <ref> [9] </ref> and the resulting smaller number of characters and character states make it more suitable but the resulting interface is still very crowded. A third alternative is to mimic the use of a key incrementally querying the user for the state of characters. <p> We believe our eventual interface will be a hybrid of all three approaches but so far integrating them has proved troublesome. We have implemented a natural language-based interface and a menu-based interface as HTML forms [1]. This allows identification of euca-lypts using information extracted from <ref> [9] </ref> to be conducted via the World Wide Web [3]. Both interfaces display the current candidate set as hypertext links to an HTML version of the source text. <p> The centralisation of the knowledge base that this use of the World Wide Web provides offers a very important potential for on-going maintenance of the knowledge base. Although only published six years ago <ref> [9] </ref> is already seriously out of date because a hundred or more new taxa have since been described by taxonomists. It may be many years before this is remedied by a new edition. A central electronic knowledge base can be much more cheaply and frequently maintained than a paper text. <p> I would also to like to thank the Environmental Resources Information Network for making the <ref> [9] </ref> electronically available.

Reference-contexts: We also exploit this but unfortunately the non-logical nature of negation in standard Prolog means it must be done less elegantly than in the positive case. We also attempt to use definitions from a general dictionary, an on-line version of Collins English Dictionary <ref> [10] </ref>, when available in classification of unknown words. Our system does not parse the definitions but rather examines them for words in our lexicon. For example, the dictionary definition for puce is adj, a dark purplish brown suggesting that puce might belong to the same category as brown and purple.

Reference-contexts: In practice, the presence of unknown distributions and invalid assumptions of independence mean that the results are best viewed as ad-hoc estimates. Nonetheless, this method seems to perform well. There are some similarities with the ranking algorithms of information retrieval <ref> [11] </ref> and we hope to explore if these can offer better performance. Taxonomists consider some characters more important than others. This can be because they are less variable, more easily determined correctly or better known.

Reference-contexts: We have built an identification system based on automatically building a knowledge base from natural language taxonomic descriptions. If you examine taxonomic descriptions, such as Figure 2 (taken from <ref> [13] </ref>), it is clear they are written in a distinctive sublanguage. The descriptions contain few verbs and are mainly a terse sequence of noun phrases which are rich in adjectives and adverbs. <p> Our system can operate successfully even with incomplete knowledge extraction. Although our system is intended to handle taxonomic descriptions of any group, so far our efforts have been restricted to two botany texts with usefully disparate characteristics. The Flora of New South Wales <ref> [13] </ref> is a four volume 2,000 page text containing descriptions of the over 6,000 plant species known from the state of New South Wales. There is great variety in the plants involved from tiny aquatic plants a few millimetres across to towering forest trees over 50 me-tres tall. <p> In contrast to the previous text the species described are closely related and quite similar and there is a single main author. The result is its descriptions are much more consistent in nature than those in <ref> [13] </ref>. 4 Ontology Taxonomists consider the essence of a taxonomic description to be a list of properties possessed by the taxon. Each property in the list is considered to be composed of a character and one or more states. <p> Furthermore, there is a tendency for the sentences containing the most important descriptive information to follow typical forms and thus they are more easily parsed. Thus raw statistics of sentence coverage which could be easily gathered are not useful. Our manually constructed parser extracted from <ref> [13] </ref> 100,000 character/state pairs and 20,000 character/state pairs from [9]. Unfortunately we have no way to estimate how many character/state pairs are present in the text. Our only useful assessment method is manual examination of randomly sampled taxa. <p> This has the advantages of the natural language interface and it provides cues to the user for describing the specimen. Unfortunately it also can produce a very crowded interface. The diversity of the species described in <ref> [13] </ref> and the resulting number of characters and states make it difficult to provide such an interface. The much more homogeneous descriptions of [9] and the resulting smaller number of characters and character states make it more suitable but the resulting interface is still very crowded. <p> External users successfully employed even alpha versions of the system. We are currently obtaining quantitative performance statistics including speed and accuracy for identification made with our system and for identifications made with the original texts. Our system when using the knowledge base extracted from <ref> [13] </ref> is dealing successfully with an order of magnitude more taxa than any computer-based identification system we are aware of.

Reference-contexts: Commonly multiple states of a character will occur in one taxon for example, petal colour may be red or pink, leaf width may be between 8cm and 12cm. The terminology is not universal with some authors meaning by character the combination of what we have termed character and state <ref> [16] </ref>. A character may be an arbitrarily complicated statement with the possible states being true or false. This would require a very expressive knowledge representation.

Reference-contexts: Radford's text provided 1500 entries for the lexicon which were supplemented by a further 500 words added manually as they were encountered during parses of the texts. These were mainly words which see wide use outside botany and thus were not present in the lists extracted from <ref> [20] </ref>. The base lexicon is supplemented by a number of lexical rules. Some of these implement general English morphology, for example almost all plurals of nouns are generated this way rather than by being explicitly included in the lexicon. <p> Although it is undeniable that a fraction of even specialists' identifications are incorrect, there is considerable resistance to viewing identification as a probabilistic process <ref> [20] </ref>. We believe accommodating the probabilistic nature of the process becomes more important when dealing with non-specialists who are both less skilled and demand less certainty. We hope, in future work, by instrumenting our system to demonstrate that a probabilistic approach has significant benefits.

Reference-contexts: This was certainly a problem in cursory trials of general-coverage parsers. The sublanguage was sufficiently restricted that construction of a special purpose parser with useful coverage was not difficult. Several man-days were invested in constructing incrementally about 70 definite clause grammar rules <ref> [21] </ref>. These were combined with an initial phase which split a sentence into components allowing information to be obtained when only part of a sentence can be parsed.

Reference-contexts: The construction of the lexicon was more problematical than the grammar. A sizable fraction of the sublanguage is not even found in general dictionaries nor was a suitable on-line compilation of biological terms available. Instead as the basis of our lexicon we used Radford's textbook work on plant systematics <ref> [22] </ref>. This was more valuable than a dictionary because it provided an extensive listing of characters and their possible states. This is useful because the character is often partly or completely implicit in the text and must be inferred from its state and the context.

Reference-contexts: DELTA can generate traditional keys and its language is also carefully designed to allow the DELTA descriptions to be converted to natural language if suitable care is taken in the construction of the DELTA descriptions. This has allowed large books to be generated from DELTA descriptions <ref> [23] </ref>. Biologists' reactions to DELTA and other computer-based identification systems are mixed.

Reference-contexts: More useful and unfortunately more difficult is automatically or semi-automatically adding grammar rules to improve the grammar's coverage. The results of Zelle and Mooney <ref> [24] </ref> using machine learning to construct parsers are very promising. Unfortunately their methods probably can not be directly applied in our context because of the difficulty in obtaining a training set.
