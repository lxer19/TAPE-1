Abstract: Detection of underground fires is an important security task in hard-coal mining. Automated fire detection systems are usually based on the monitoring of carbon monoxide (CO). Systems using conventional technology based on threshold and tendency observations, however, generate a large number of false alarms. We show how CO-concentrations can be forecast by appropriate models of the physical and chemical processes. We furthermore describe a rule-based specification system utilizing forecasting for CO-monitoring. The improvement of this approach over the conventional is threefold. First, the number of false alarms is reduced by 50%, at least. Simultaneously, the thresholds for warnings and alarms can be reduced so that, second, the detection of real fires becomes both quicker and more reliable. Third, heuristic rules for fire detection and suppression of false alarms as well as the control of the forecasting can be described in a declarative way. While our system is still in a prototypic stage, the three major German hard-coal mining companies decided to use our approach in their CO-monitoring systems.

Reference-contexts: The algebra check limit defines the control of incoming CO-values with respect to given warning and alarm thresholds. As a more sophisticated example, we will subsequently show some rules for the filtering of blasting curves. The fire detection system identifies underground blastings and filters their high CO-values. According to <ref> [DMT93, SSSS82] </ref> a blasting curve is divided into three parts (see Figure 9): the first part starts at the beginning of the curve and ends at the first turning point T. The second part starts at T and ends at the maximum M of the curve.

Reference-contexts: Thus we can use the cross-correlation between these values as evaluation function for the matches. The cross-correlation r xy 2 [0; 1], see equation (1), is a quantitative measure of the linear dependency between n values of two random variables X and Y <ref> [HEK89] </ref>: r xy = i=1 v u n X x 2 ! n X y 2 ! (1) 2.2 Approximation of the Mapping The prediction of the CO-concentration at a CO-sensor is of course most important for high values. <p> Such a mapping is shown in whirling we show in Figure 4 the input data before having computed the whirling. Obviously the Gaussian process leads to a significantly more linear dependency of the values. The relation of the CO-values shown in Figure 5 is approximated by linear regression <ref> [HEK89] </ref>. As Figure 6 illustrates, the resulting mapping allows an accurate prediction of CO-curves. The figure contains KNOWLEDGE-ENHANCED CO-MONITORING IN COAL-MINES the measured CO-curve of a CO-device and the predicted CO-curve based on the values of the preceeding device.

Reference-contexts: In this way, EAs contribute to enhance security in underground coal-mining. EAs are suitable for an efficient implementation using logic programming. A Prolog-based EA-implementation for sequential non-modular EAs emphasizing efficiency exists <ref> [Kap93] </ref>. But for our system for fire detection, it was necessary to have modularity and parallelism. Each part of the complex analyzing meth ods constitutes a module of its own. Each module is executed in parallel for all sensors in the mine. Different modules represent distributed processes communicating via streams.

Reference-contexts: Since the end of the seventies, the Ruhr-kohle Bergbau AG uses process computers to control the CO-concentrations measured by the CO-sensors [SSSS82]. Such a process computer installed on a mine monitors for each CO-sensor the mean CO-values averaged over a time period of one minute. In this system <ref> [Kar87] </ref>, apart from absolute thresholds increasing CO-concentrations and special properties of CO-curves are used as indicators of open or smoldering fires. <p> By repeated usage of this method on updated samples the time delay can be adapted to the changing environment in the mine. In the approach described in <ref> [Kar87] </ref> the determination of the time delay based on sample data depends on significant CO-values above 3.0 ppm. Especially on weekends or for devices far away from mining activities this method is not applicable. We therefore introduce a method extracting the time delay independently of such peaks.
