Reference-contexts: The committee was formed to discuss and resolve problems relating to the OpenMath "transport layer": this is the layer concerned solely with the transmission of the byte string encodings of OpenMath objects. The basis of the discussion was to be the OpenMath Objectives document <ref> [OMObj] </ref> which explains the intended purpose of OpenMath. That document presents a layered decomposition of the task of OpenMath, and here we are concerned with the interrelationship between OpenMath encodings (which are byte strings) and the transport layer.
