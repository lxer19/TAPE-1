Abstract: CALT-68-1401 DOE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT REPORT Revised Version Abstract Both the Green-Schwarz and Siegel strings are presented in canonical form. Both systems are shown to describe the same number of physical degrees of freedom. The apparent extra symmetries of the Siegel string are not true symmetries but are combinations of second-class constraints. A formal quantization procedure is outlined and the problems of quantization are discussed.
