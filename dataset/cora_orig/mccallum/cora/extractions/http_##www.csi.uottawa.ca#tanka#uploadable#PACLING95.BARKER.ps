Title: Interactive semantic analysis of Clause-Level Relationships

Abstract: This paper describes the design and implementation of a system that uses surfacesyntactic information to interpret interactively semantic relationships between clauses. English technical texts are analyzed by a domain-independent parser that produces detailed parse trees of the input. The system then examines clausal con-nectives and syntactic verb phrase features to determine what kinds of semantic relationships exist between clauses. The results of this activity are used in a large Knowledge Acquisition system that, by design, requires little a priori semantic knowledge. We present a set of semantic labels appropriate to syntactically connected clauses (Clause-Level Relationships) and a description of the theory behind assigning these labels to particular inputs (Clause-Level Relationship Analysis). We also discuss elements of the implementation of the Clause-Level Relationship Analyzer and look at its performance.
