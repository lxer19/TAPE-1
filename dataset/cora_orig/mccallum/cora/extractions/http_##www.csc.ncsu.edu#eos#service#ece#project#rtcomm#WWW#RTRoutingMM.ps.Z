Abstract: Interactive voice and video applications (e.g. teleconferencing) over multi-hop packet-switched networks require bounds on delay, loss, and jitter. This paper compares routing algorithms and admission control methods which are intended to provide the quality of service required by such applications. The method of comparison is detailed simulation. As part of this work, we propose several novel real-time routing algorithms. The best-performing routing algorithm is a new method which takes into account the constraints imposed by the admission control algorithm. A routing algorithm similar to those used in the phone system is the worst of the dynamic algorithms; static routing is far worse than any of these. The differences between the routing algorithms are greatest when the network is highly connected, and when admission control constraints are difficult to meet. The issue of fairness is also considered in the evaluation of the routing algorithms.

Reference-contexts: This algorithm finds the shortest path (with link lengths as described above for the SC algorithm) from among all feasible minimum-hop paths. We implemented M-SC as an approximation of the algorithm of Ahmadi et.al. <ref> [1] </ref>, in an attempt to compare their routing algorithm with others. Another promising idea for routing is to identify a path with minimum total length (where link lengths are as described for the SC algorithm), as well as minimum total delay. Unfortunately this problem is NP-complete [8]. <p> However, it clearly uses the minimum resources possible for each channel that is admitted, and at high network loads will surpass most other algorithms by our measure. This same observation has been made in <ref> [1] </ref>. To the categories of fairness identified in [9], we would add one more that is appropriate for high-speed networks: different types of calls should have roughly equal probability of acceptance.

Reference-contexts: Deterministic multiplexing produces strong guarantees, but is conservative and so normally results in lower link utilizations. A much more complete discussion of these issues in the context of real-time traffic, including a survey of existing work, can be found in reference <ref> [2] </ref>. In our study we used exclusively deterministic methods of admission control and multiplexing. The only effective way to calculate the QoS produced by statistical methods in multi-hop networks is to simulate the end-to-end transmission of every packet. This can require a huge amount of CPU time for high-speed networks.

Reference-contexts: Because channels have many of the characteristics of circuits in circuit-switched networks, it seems reasonable to expect that circuit-switched routing algorithms would perform well. Elwalid <ref> [6] </ref> also suggested that this type of routing algorithm should perform well for real-time traffic when it is statistically multiplexed based on the concept of effective bandwidths. These algorithms also have the advantage that they are totally distributed, and do not require updates of routing tables.

Reference-contexts: Another promising idea for routing is to identify a path with minimum total length (where link lengths are as described for the SC algorithm), as well as minimum total delay. Unfortunately this problem is NP-complete <ref> [8] </ref>. The Min Max Cost with Delay Bound (MMCDB) algorithm is a heuristic approximation to this ideal algorithm. A path is found for which the maximum length of any link in the path is minimized, while also satisfying the end-to-end delay bound. A sketch of the algorithm is as follows.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the results from multiple experiments can be directly and fairly 1 Our experiments did not place any restrictions on jitter. There may be significant differences between 4 compared. The three admission control methods which we used in this study are Earliest-Due-Date (EDD)[7], Stop&Go <ref> [11] </ref>, and Weighted-Fair-Queuing (WFQ)[19]. Each of these is described briefly below. The low utilization which is a drawback of deterministic methods can be improved through the use of traffic shaping, at the expense of some packet loss. <p> the admission control methods and routers with respect to jitter; this was not studied. 2 We have described and run experiments with the "simple" form of EDD; the full version is even more flexible, and even more expensive to implement. 5 2.2 Stop&Go The Stop&Go service and admission control policy <ref> [11] </ref> is designed to provide very tight bounds on end-to-end jitter in networks, as well as predictable end-to-end delays. Each requesting channel i is assigned to some frame of size (duration) T g , and is allocated a transmission bandwidth r i . <p> the QoS guarantees given to existing calls using the link, only if the following necessary constraint is satisfied: C g0 G X C g ( C n ; g0 = 1 When the ratios of the frame sizes are integers, instead of Equation 3 reduces to a simple capacity constraint <ref> [11] </ref>. There is an important source of bandwidth wastage called quantization, which can be explained in the following way. Many networks have a fixed or lower limit on the size of a packet; let this be denoted l unit .

Reference-contexts: The implicit goal of C DYN is to minimize the end-to-end delay encountered by a channel. A desirable by-product is that the load on the network tends to get evenly distributed. 3.2 An Algorithm Based on Circuit-Switched Network Routing Hwang et al <ref> [14] </ref> proposed the use of sequential routing algorithms, similar to those used in circuit-switched networks, for routing in integrated services networks. Because channels have many of the characteristics of circuits in circuit-switched networks, it seems reasonable to expect that circuit-switched routing algorithms would perform well.

We summarize a restatement of that analysis due to Partridge [21]. In WFQ, channels sharing an outgoing link are transmitted as if they were serviced in Round-Robin order on a bit-by-bit basis.

Reference-contexts: Thus, it is important to know how existing routing algorithms will perform on this type of traffic, and if they don't perform well, to devise algorithms which will work well. Little work has been done on this important topic. This previous work includes the following. * Parris and Ferrari <ref> [20] </ref> proposed a routing algorithm for real-time applications (de scribed in Section 3 as the SP algorithm) but did not investigate its performance. * Kompella et al [16] have investigated some routing problems for multicasting of multimedia data. <p> The advantage of the SP algorithm is that worst-case delays are calculated directly from the admission control policy, rather than indirectly from the link utilization. The SP algorithm was first proposed in <ref> [20] </ref>. However, no quantitative evaluation was presented. The Shortest Cost (SC) routing algorithm is targeted to meet server constraints, rather than minimizing end-to-end delay. This approach seems reasonable in the case where end-to-end delay bounds are not particularly difficult to achieve.

In WFQ, channels sharing an outgoing link are transmitted as if they were serviced in Round-Robin order on a bit-by-bit basis. <p> Due to restrictions on the length of this paper, we do not describe token buckets; a good introduction can be found in <ref> [21] </ref>. A channel i is assigned a transmission bandwidth or rate of r i &gt; ae i on all links along its path. <p> The enforcement of the effective bandwidth is achieved by traffic shaping. A traffic shaper delays the arrival of some packets in order to smooth the arrival process for the channel. This delay can be accomplished by mechanisms such as leaky and token buckets (again, see <ref> [21] </ref> for an introduction). If the buffer capacity is exceeded (input rate exceeds output rate for too long a period), some packets may be discarded. The token generation rate and bucket size are calculated to ensure the losses do not exceed the user-specified quality-of-service bound.
