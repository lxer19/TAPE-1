Abstract: Effective information gathering on the WWW is a complex task requiring planning, scheduling, text processing, and interpretation-style reasoning about extracted data to resolve inconsistencies and to refine hypotheses about the data. This paper describes the rationale, architecture, and implementation of a next generation information gathering system a system that integrates several areas of AI research under a single research umbrella. The goal of this system is to exploit the vast number of information sources available today on the NII including a growing number of digital libraries, independent news agencies, government agencies, as well as human experts providing a variety of services. The large number of information sources and their different levels of accessibility, reliability and associated costs present a complex information gathering coordination problem. Our solution is an information gathering agent, BIG, that plans to gather information to support a decision process, reasons about the resource tradeoffs of different possible gathering approaches, extracts information from both unstructured and structured documents, and uses the extracted information to refine its search and processing activities.

Reference-contexts: We are experimenting with enhancements to our information extraction systems to cope with this and planning to use a tf/idf style document classifier <ref> (Callan 1996) </ref> to pre-qualify documents before running the extraction system on them. We have also learned new things about the Design-to-Criteria scheduler and discovered some modeling problems with applying the TMS task modeling framework to this application.

Reference-contexts: The task assessor encodes the plans in the TMS <ref> (Decker & Lesser 1993) </ref> generic, domain-independent task modeling framework. The TMS models then serve as input to the agent scheduler and other agent control components that will be added in the future (e.g., a multi-agent coordi nation module).

Reference-contexts: Our time/quality/cost trade-off approach is similar to formal methods <ref> (Etzioni et al. 1996) </ref> for reasoning about gathering information, except that our trade-off analysis focuses on problem solving actions (including text processing) and other agent activities rather than simply focusing on the trade-offs of different information resources, i.e., our work addresses both agent control level and information value.

Reference-contexts: The information extractors are implemented as knowledge sources in BIG's RESUN planner and are invoked after documents are retrieved and posted to the blackboard. The information extractors are: textext-ks This knowledge source processes unstructured text documents using the BADGER <ref> (Soderland et al. 1995) </ref> information extraction system to extract particular desired data. The extraction component uses a combination of learned domain-specific extraction rules, domain knowledge, and knowledge of sentence construction to identify and extract the desired information.
