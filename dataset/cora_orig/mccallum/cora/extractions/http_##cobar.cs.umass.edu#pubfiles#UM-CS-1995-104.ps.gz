Reference-contexts: That is, there is a natural decomposition of an image into Gaussian derivatives at several scales. Gaussians and their derivatives have, therefore, been successfully used for matching images of the same object under different viewpoints <ref> [1, 24, 25, 10, 15, 20] </ref>. This paper is an extension to matching "similar" objects using Gaussian derivatives. The retrieval scheme presented here is not meant to be a model of retrieval in biological systems. However, some of its components are similar to those used in the human visual system. <p> Some of the earliest uses of scale in matching go back to the Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids constructed by Burt and Adelson [2] and Crowley [3]. These pyramids have been used to do coarse to fine matching under translation, affine or more general transforms (see <ref> [1] </ref>). The pyramids speedup the computation as well as performing matching at the appropriate scales. However, as Lindeberg [14] in his extensive discussion of scale space and its properties, points out, they do not form a true scale space.

Reference-contexts: The use of multiple derivative filters requires that correlation be performed between vectors. This is discussed by Granlund et al [7]. Some of the earliest uses of scale in matching go back to the Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids constructed by Burt and Adelson <ref> [2] </ref> and Crowley [3]. These pyramids have been used to do coarse to fine matching under translation, affine or more general transforms (see [1]). The pyramids speedup the computation as well as performing matching at the appropriate scales. <p> This is the reason warping is required during VR matching across scales. On the other hand, the VR list approach should not be confused with pyramidal representations <ref> [2] </ref>. While pyramidal representations are also generated by filtering and sub-sampling images, there is an important distinction. Pyramids are generated as a translational search reduction mechanism for use in coarse-to-fine matching.

Reference-contexts: The retrieval scheme presented here is not meant to be a model of retrieval in biological systems. However, some of its components are similar to those used in the human visual system. The use of appearance based representations is in conformity with with both neurophysiological <ref> [4] </ref> and psychophysical [13] evidence that memory is accessed using imagery rather than symbolic information. In addition, it is known that filtering is performed using Gaussian derivatives (or similar filters) at multiple scales in the striate cortex [23].

Reference-contexts: The first concerns matching using Gaussian derivative filters at multiple scales. The idea of using Gaussian derivatives for matching and recovering local structure was suggested among others by Koenderink [12]. Among filter representations, Gaussian derivatives have a number of advantages they are steer-able <ref> [5] </ref> and separable. The use of multiple derivative filters requires that correlation be performed between vectors. This is discussed by Granlund et al [7]. Some of the earliest uses of scale in matching go back to the Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids constructed by Burt and Adelson [2] and Crowley [3].

Reference-contexts: Some of the important challenges in building a retrieval system are the choice of image attributes (or features), their representations, query construction methods and matching techniques. Queries may be based on different attributes of an image <ref> [6] </ref>, such as color distribution, motion, shape, structure, texture or perhaps user drawn sketches or even abstract token sets (such as points, lines etc.). Image retrieval can be viewed as an ordering of match scores that are obtained by searching through the database. <p> The second thread to which our work is related is the area of image indexing and retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, retrieval on the basis of appearance or shape is almost entirely based on prior segmentation of the object. Examples include the QBIC project at IBM <ref> [6] </ref>, the photo book project at the media lab [18] and shape retrieval [17]. These methods all require knowledge of the contour or binary shape of the object. For specific objects like faces, principal component analysis has been used successfully for representation [11] and retrieval [22].

By smoothing an image with Gaus-sians at several different scales Lindeberg generates a scale-space representation. While VR lists are scale-space representations, however, they differ from Lindeberg's approach in two fundamental ways.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The advent of multi-media and large image collections in several different domains brings forth image retrieval as an important issue. Applications of an image retrieval system range from database management in museums and medicine, architectural and interior design, image archiving, to constructing multi-media documents or presentations <ref> [8] </ref>. Some of the important challenges in building a retrieval system are the choice of image attributes (or features), their representations, query construction methods and matching techniques.

Reference-contexts: The choice of Gaussians and their derivatives as a representation is motivated by a number of considerations. It has been argued by Koenderink and others that the structure of an image may be represented using Gaussian derivatives [12]. Hancock et al <ref> [9] </ref> have shown that the principal components of a set of images containing natural structures may be modeled as the outputs of a Gaussian and its derivatives at several scales. That is, there is a natural decomposition of an image into Gaussian derivatives at several scales.

The 7 notion of matching across Gaussians of different scales was used by Manmatha [15] for match-ing image patches under similarity and affine transforms. <p> Consider Gaussian derivatives in 1-D. The odd derivatives are all correlated with each other. This also holds true for the even derivatives which are correlated with each other. However, for the same , the first derivative of a Gaussian is uncorrelated with the second derivative of a Gaussian <ref> [10] </ref>. Thus picking only the first and second derivatives of Gaussians insures that maximal information is extracted from the image. Gaussian (as opposed to Gaussian derivatives) filters are not used because they are sensitive to the actual intensity value.

As Lindeberg points out recursive application of filters and sub-sampling as is done in pyramidal schemes is not in general a scale-space representation <ref> [14] </ref>. VR lists, which are not generated recursively, are proper scale-space representations and the matching occurs across scale-space.

He also used the idea of comparing the outputs of Gaussians at different standard deviations to compute large scale changes. <p> In particular consider two corresponding points p 0 and p 1 and assume the image is Gaussian filtered at p 0 Then by substituting for I 0 using equation 3 we have: Z Z But it can be shown that G (r; ) = G (sr; s) <ref> [15] </ref>. <p> This is not a surprising result if 11 the output of a Gaussian filter is viewed as a Gaussian weighted average of the intensity. A more detailed derivation of this result is provided in <ref> [15] </ref>. The derivation above does not use an explicit value of the scale change s. Thus, equation 5 is valid for any scale change s. <p> The form of equation 5 resembles a convolution and in fact it may be rewritten as a convolution I 0 (r) ? G (:; ) = I 1 (sr) ? G (:; s) (6) Similar derivations may also be carried out for higher derivatives of Gaussians (see <ref> [15] </ref>). Here the results for the first and second derivatives of Gaussians are listed.

Reference-contexts: Note that the first derivative of a Gaussian is a vector and the second derivative of a Gaussian a 2 by 2 matrix.

For example, the database used in the experiments has several diesel locomotives.
