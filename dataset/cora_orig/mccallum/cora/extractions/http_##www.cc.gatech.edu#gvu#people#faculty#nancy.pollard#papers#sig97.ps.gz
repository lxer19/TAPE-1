Abstract: This paper describes an algorithm for automatically adapting existing simulated behaviors to new characters. Animating a new character is difficult because a control system tuned for one character will not, in general, work on a character with different limb lengths, masses, or moments of inertia. The algorithm presented here adapts the control system to a new character in two stages. First, the control system parameters are scaled based on the sizes, masses, and moments of inertia of the new and the original characters. Then a subset of the parameters is fine-tuned using a search process based on simulated annealing. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we animate the running motion of a woman, child, and imaginary character by modifying the control system for a man. We also animate the bicycling motion of a second imaginary character by modifying the control system for a man. We evaluate the results of this approach by comparing the motion of the simulated human runners with video of an actual child and with data for men, women, and children in the literature. In addition to adapting a control system for a new model, this approach can also be used to adapt the control system in an on-line fashion to produce a physically realistic metamorphosis from the original to the new model while the morphing character is performing the behavior. We demonstrate this on-line adaptation with a morph from a man to a woman over a period of twenty seconds.

In the remainder of the paper, we describe the algorithm for adapting control systems for steady-state running, bicycling, and physically realistic morphing.

Reference-contexts: The local minima in this plot result from the fact that the optimization function combines a variety of criteria that together provide a high-level evaluation of a complex motion. In an informal evaluation of search techniques, simulated annealing <ref> [24] </ref> appeared to provide better results on this search space than Powell's method, a line-search technique. Simulated annealing was used to tune the control system for the characters described in this paper. A typical search required approximately 1500 evaluations and 15 hours of processing time on an SGI R8000 computer.

Reference-contexts: Huang and van de Panne [15] used a best-first search to discover a sequence of set points that, when combined with a proportional-derivative servo, allowed a two link acrobot to hop and flip. Closed loop controllers were synthesized by van de Panne and his colleagues <ref> [35, 36] </ref> for the jumping Luxo lamp and other simple systems using dynamic programming. A generate and-test strategy was used by van de Panne and Fiume [34] to produce neural network-based control systems for a wide variety of planar creatures with 3-6 links.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge can be incorporated in the form of external guiding forces, via an existing but imperfect control system, or through motion capture data. External forces were used by Lamouret and van de Panne <ref> [37] </ref> to maintain the attitude of the body of a walking human figure, thereby guiding the optimization process towards the desired solution. The external force was eliminated in later stages of the optimization.

Reference-contexts: A more appealing approach is automatic or semi-automatic design. One such approach treats the problem of generating motion as a trajectory optimization problem. Witkin and Kass <ref> [38] </ref> used this approach to control a jumping Luxo lamp. Cohen and Liu [8, 19] divided the optimization problem into smaller spacetime windows thereby providing more control for the animator and reducing the time required for the optimization.

Reference-contexts: Other researchers have realized that if generating motion directly proves too difficult, perhaps we can obtain desired motion by adapting or smoothly blending between existing motion sequences derived from procedural approaches, simulation, or motion capture <ref> [39, 7, 33, 27, 12] </ref>. Techniques for adapting existing trajectories via optimization share with our work the idea that optimization procedures can be used to adapt to new situations. The two approaches differ in the level of the parameters used by the optimization.

Reference-contexts: They used this approach to control a two-link acrobot and a planar diving figure. Liu, Gortler, and Cohen [20] implemented a hierarchical wavelet-based version of spacetime constraints to allow finer detail where necessary without increasing the computation cost uniformly. Zhao and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania <ref> [40] </ref> represented the trajectory of the control variables as a spline and then optimized the locations of the control points for the spline. They used this approach to control a planar human figure performing a vertical jump.
