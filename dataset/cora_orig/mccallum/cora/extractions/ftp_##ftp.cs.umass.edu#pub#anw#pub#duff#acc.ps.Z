Abstract: 5 v(i) = 0: One is naturally led to consider what new computational methods might be suggested by adopting alternative root-finding procedures. This paper summarizes an investigation of the consequences of adopting one particular root-finding scheme called the method of continuity (also known as the method of imbedding

Reference-contexts: The optimal value function satisfies Bellman's optimality equation (1), and the optimal policy is greedy with respect to it. 2. The Method of Continuity and an Imbedding for Bellman's Equation Suppose that the nonlinear equation to be solved is F (x) = 0. In the method of continuity <ref> [1] </ref>, one constructs a function G (x; ), where is a real parameter, such that when = 1 , G (x; 1 ) = F (x), and when = 0 , G (x; 0 ) is an equation that is easily solved.
