Abstract: Recent neurophysiological evidence suggests that the so-called precedence effect is a composite of multiple phenomena, in particular echo suppression and active mechanisms that build up and release suppression. We propose a simple functional model of echo suppression in a population of low-frequency ITD 1 -sensitive neurons in the inferior colliculus. Our model is based on Zurek's 1987 proposal, and we show that it is consistent with Zurek's 1980 psychophysical data by presenting the results of two experiments. The current model is extensible to other localization cues represented by rate-place codes, and we suggest that a model such as this is a necessary component of computational models of spatial hearing.

In the IC, 50% second-click recovery times (measured as a ratio of click counts) ranged from 1-64 ms, with a median of 6 ms. <p> This is an ad hoc transformation that results in inhibition curves that are intuitively satisfying for a wide range of input stimuli. Finally, the output of the interaural cross-correlation is multiplied by the inhibitory signal, as suggested by Zurek's model (Figure 2, <ref> [1] </ref>). 2.4. Model output The output of the model as shown in Figure 4e and f is intended to represent the firing probability of a population of ITD-sensitive cells in the IC with center frequencies near 500 Hz.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS To test the proposed model, we simulated two of the experiments reported by Zurek <ref> [4] </ref>, using binaural noise-burst pairs and the sub-burst paradigm. Both of Zurek's experiments employed a three interval three-alternative forced-choice (3AFC) paradigm. 3.1. Binaural noise-burst pairs The stimuli in the first experiment consisted of combinations of short (1 ms) noise bursts. <p> The fit is somewhat awkward, but the general trends are correct. Notably, suppression exhibited by the model is not nearly as strong as that in bursts. Zurek's measurements from subject PZ are reproduced in open circles (after <ref> [4] </ref>). Results from the model are shown as filled squares. See text for details and interpretation. from subject PZ are reproduced in open circles (after [4]).

Any misunderstandings, however, are mine alone.

Reference-contexts: Neurophysiological correlates Recent neurophysiological evidence reveals suppression of the neural response to the lagging click in a binaural click pair (see Figure 1a) in the auditory brain-stem. Fitzpatrick et al. <ref> [8] </ref> reported an increase in suppression from the level of the superior olivary complex (SOC; the first site of binaural interaction) to the inferior colliculus (IC; a nucleus strongly implicated in localization and a stopping point precedence-effect data (after [1]). between the SOC and the auditory cortex). <p> This results in a dependence of the degree of suppression on the ITD of the leading sound. The ITD-dependence varies from neuron to neuron, perhaps due to different combinations of inhibitory input <ref> [8] </ref>. The functional significance of this ITD-dependence is unknown, and since it does not vary predictably across the neural population (and it seems likely to be an artifact of the neural implementation), we have chosen not to model this aspect of the neural response. 2.
