Title: Filtering Techniques for Complex Geometry Fluid Flows  
Author: Julie S. Mullen and Paul F. Fischer 
Abstract: We develop a class of filters based upon the numerical solution of high-order elliptic problems in lR d that allow for independent determination of order and cut-off wave number and that default to classical Fourier-based filters in homogeneous domains. However, because they are based on the solution of a PDE, the present filters are not restricted to applications in tensor-product-based geometries as is generally the case for Fourier-based filters. The discrete representation of the filtered output is constructed from a Krylov space generated in solving a well-conditioned system arising from a low-order PDE.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The need for low-pass filters arises in the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDE's) in many areas of science and engineering. The ability to control high-frequency content is an essential ingredient for many applications in computational fluid dynamics <ref> [1, 7, 10] </ref>. In particular, recently developed dynamic subgrid scale models for large eddy simulations (LES) require a two-level filter to extrapolate the leading-order effects of unresolved scales of motion [5, 8, 12]. <p> (1), then solving for u corresponds to the usual notion of filtering via convolution with the kernel G and characteristic length scale 1= p u (x) = F (u (x)) = The effect of such a filter on the input is clear if we consider the one-dimensional case with = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and u (0) = u (1) = 0. <p> Similar results have also been obtained in the somewhat easier case of finite difference approximations. We begin with a two-dimensional test on the unit square, = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 with the asymmetric input function u (x; y) = = l=2 k=2 2 2:0 l sin (kx) sin (ly) ; (15) which is shown in Fig. 2a.

Reference-contexts: One important idea is that a given Krylov space, R, might be used to filter similar right-hand sides by simply changing the right-most term (u) in either (10) or (12) (see, e.g., <ref> [2, 3] </ref>). In addition, we note that multi-level solvers might be used to speed the filtering process, following ideas outlined in [7].

Reference-contexts: Fortunately, P m and A share the same set of eigenvectors, and we can use this fact to generate good approximate solutions to (6).

The matrix S contains the eigenvectors of T , and RS contains the corresponding approximate eigenvectors of A.

While there has been some study of the potential of second-order filters in LES (e.g., <ref> [12] </ref>), most LES calculations to date have employed sharp cut-off filters. These are readily implementable in simple geometries that admit the use of Fourier bases.
