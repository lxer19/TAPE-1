Abstract: We present results of a scheme to encode video sequences of digital image data based on a quadtree still-image fractal method. The scheme encodes each frame using image pieces, or vectors, from its predecessor; hence it can be thought of as a VQ scheme in which the code book is derived from the previous image. We present results showing: near real-time (5 - 12 frames/sec) software-only decoding; resolution independence; high compression ratios (25 - 244:1); and low compression times (2.4 - 66 sec/frame) as compared with standard fixed image fractal schemes. More information on various fractal schemes can be found at the WWW site "http://legendre.ucsd.edu/Research/Fisher/fractal.html."

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recent publications <ref> [1] </ref>, notably that of Jacquin [2], have demonstrated a new method of encoding images as collections of self transformations. Broadly, the method can be described as follows: A convergent map t : F ! F is sought on a complete space F of all possible images. <p> Chicago, Illinois. 1 2 Fractal Compression In this article, we will give only a terse description of still-image fractal methods. A thorough introduction and the latest implementation and theoretical results can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. We consider an image as a function f (x) from the unit square I 2 = [0; 1] fi [0; 1] to the reals IR where where f (x), x 2 I 2 , represents the grey level at x. <p> A thorough introduction and the latest implementation and theoretical results can be found in [1]. We consider an image as a function f (x) from the unit square I 2 = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1] to the reals IR where where f (x), x 2 I 2 , represents the grey level at x. The range of f (x) is I, with f (x) = 0 being black and f (x) = 1 being white. <p> A thorough introduction and the latest implementation and theoretical results can be found in [1]. We consider an image as a function f (x) from the unit square I 2 = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1] to the reals IR where where f (x), x 2 I 2 , represents the grey level at x. The range of f (x) is I, with f (x) = 0 being black and f (x) = 1 being white. <p> This condition assures convergence in F = L p (I 2 ) with the L p metric as well as a.e. pointwise convergence. This condition also allows for simpler quantization of the s (x) values. The details can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> again in Section 4. 2 Unfortunately, this better notation developed after the use of these terms became fairly standard. 3 The notation fj A denotes the restriction of the function f to the set A. quantization, we can take js i j &lt; 1, though this is not necessary (see <ref> [1] </ref>). With these restrictions on m (x); s (x); and o (x), the operator t m;s;o can be compactly specified. <p> This condition is sufficient for the L p metrics also; in this case t is not contractive, but it is eventually contractive (see <ref> [1] </ref>). 4 Implementation While the static example of the Section 2.1 is naive, it contains most of the ideas of a practical video implementation. <p> If the rms difference of g i1 and f i on A j is above a predetermined tolerance t mc , then the range A j is encoded using a standard fractal scheme as described briefly below (and in detail in <ref> [1] </ref>, Chapter 3). Briefly, the fractal encoding of A j is done by comparing A j to domain blocks B of twice the size in g i1 . <p> We now briefly describe the classification scheme. A complete description of the classification scheme can also be found in Chapter 3 of <ref> [1] </ref>. The scheme computes the average luminosity of each quadrant of a domain or range block, and rotates and/or flips the block to one of the three possible canonical positions with brightest quadrant appearing in the upper left. Each canonical position corresponds to one of three major classes. <p> Each image is also postprocessed to minimize artifacts along the partition boundaries. The postprocessing consists of a weighted average of pixels along the boundary of the quadtree partition (again, see Chapter 3, <ref> [1] </ref> for a complete description). We review our parameters in the list below: M max and M min are the maximum and minimum number of times that the biggest square with side length a power of 2 is quadtree partitioned. t e is the fractal error tolerance. <p> Whether this feature is useful remains to be seen, although for some high compression still image applications it is better (in the sense of compression versus PSNR) to decimate the image, encode at the smaller size, and then expand the image during decoding (see <ref> [1] </ref>), so that there are already some signs that resolution independence is not just a solution seeking a problem.

Its strength, aside from giving compression/fidelity results that are comparable to DCT and wavelet methods <ref> [3] </ref>, is its computationally simple decoding. Its potential is strong, if it receives even a small proportion of the many thousands of man-years of work that has been invested in DCT and wavelets techniques.
