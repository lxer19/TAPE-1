Abstract: Multimedia applications in broadband ISDN present various types and classes of traffics such as video teleconferencing, broadband telephony and large file transfers. Multicasting is important in multimedia applications. Since cell loss in a multicast packet will cause the retransmission of the entire packet causing excessive load in the network, the ATM switch should provide for the reduction of cell loss of multicast traffic. The reduction in cell loss of a particular type of traffic should be done in coordination with the QoS parameters required from other classes within each traffic type. Buffering schemes are used in ATM switches to achieve the required levels of QoS. In this paper, we develop a new buffering scheme which considers traffic types that include multicasting and nonmulticasting components with two classes of cells within each traffic type. We compare the new buffering scheme with two existing schemes, No Priority and Push Out. We show that the new buffering scheme performs better than the two other schemes by reducing cell loss of multicast cells. We also introduce a new cell scheduling policy that produces lower delay for the delay sensitive class. The new buffering and scheduling schemes provide the ability to tune the cell loss and delay of each class of cells within each traffic type.

Reference-contexts: Hence, buffering schemes, which determine the buffer space allocated to the arriving cells and which cell is scheduled (serviced) next, basically decide cell loss and delay for each traffic class. Several schemes and policies were developed in the literature <ref> [1, 3, 4, 8, 15, 18, 21, 24, 25] </ref> to meet the required QoS under certain traffic conditions. Most of the work involving multicasting in an ATM switch, addresses the architecture of the cell replicating circuitry [5, 10, 17, 23] and the effect it has on cell loss.

Reference-contexts: In this case, a cell loss occurs. The performance of an ATM switch is characterized by the throughput, cell loss probability and delay jitter [16]. ATM networks are connection-oriented cell-switched networks. Cell loss and cell delay are an important part of the Quality of Service (QoS) <ref> [2] </ref> which are negotiated at the connection setup time. Cell loss and delay are the primary performance indices provided by a connection. Multicasting is important in multimedia applications.

Reference-contexts: The policy could be a static or dynamic. 3 In static policies, the decision of the next scheduled cell is based on a fixed criterion that does not depend on the current state. Examples of static policies are FCFS and HOL <ref> [14] </ref> (Head of Line). In these policies, cells are separated into different priority groups. The next serviced cell is picked from one of the groups according to a predefined policy, e.g., HOL picks the cell from the highest priority group, if its not empty and so on.
