Abstract: Incremental learning algorithms are better suited for online learning tasks in principle. However, due to the lack of efficiency, few existing incremental algorithms can outperform non-incremental algorithms in reality. This paper presents a new semi-incremental algorithm CDL4 that can learn decision lists actively and efficiently. Compared to early algorithms in the CDL family, CDL4 can learn concepts that have both discrete and continuous attributes and has a complexity of O(dn 2 ) for both online and o*ine tasks, where d is the number of attributes and n the number of mistakes made in training. Furthermore, CDL4 can actively select training instances by querying bordering counterexamples to improve the rate and accuracy of learning. Different from equivalence queries which return arbitrary counterexamples, bordering counterexamples are those that defeat the incorrect decision that has the least index in the current decision list. The paper also reports experiments on CDL4's performance on several large online learning tasks and compares them with other learning algo
