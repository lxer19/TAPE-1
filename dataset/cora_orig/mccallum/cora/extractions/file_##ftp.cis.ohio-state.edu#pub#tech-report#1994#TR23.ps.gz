Reference-contexts: A distinguishing feature of our investigation is that the simulation model accounts for the degradation in network cycle time with increased router complexity required by the use of the priority schemes and by the virtual channels. This is based on the cost model proposed by Chien <ref> [1] </ref> 1 . The simulator does not incorporate the effect of message start-up times explicitly, but for most of the network traffics used for our experiments, the average interval between generation of consecutive messages from each node is larger than typical values of start-up times. <p> It should be noted, however, that any synthetic traffic patterns considered for simulations will only give an approximation to the real situation of experimenting with actual workloads on a real machine. As mentioned earlier, the cost model proposed by A.Chien <ref> [1] </ref> has been used to determine the values for router setup delay, which is the time to create a connection through a router, and the flow control cycle time, which is the time to do a flow control operation. <p> This model has been instantiated for the 0.8 micron CMOS gate array technology. We have shown below the computation of setup delay and flow control cycle time, for dimension-order routing with a single physical channel, as done in <ref> [1] </ref>. In case of dimension-order routing, dimensions are changed in order. Hence, the router requires only one crossbar per dimension. The inputs to the crossbar in the X-dimension are from the processor, and X+ and X directions. <p> However, the ratio of the cycle times for routing with virtual channels to that without virtual channels does not change significantly owing to these modifications. Hence, the cycle times used for our simulations are based on <ref> [1] </ref>. 8 Similarly, a 3 fi 3 crossbar is needed in the Y-dimension. <p> Hence, T startup = c 3 + c 4 + c 5 fl lgF + c 0 + c 1 fl lgP where c 0 i s are constants <ref> [1] </ref>. This gives a setup delay of 5.6 nanoseconds. Similarly, T flow control = T F C + T CB where T F C is the flow controller delay, and T CB is the forward crossbar switch delay for data.

Reference-contexts: To our knowledge, the issue of variance of latencies has been addressed in detail only recently by Mraz [12]. Dally mentions briefly that the use of a particular scheduling strategy, called oldest packet first, possible with the use of virtual channels, does reduce the variance in message latency <ref> [2] </ref>. Mraz's work examines the variance that can arise in the message latency when high priority operating system functions and interrupts preempt the execution of send and receive primitives. <p> The standard deviation, , also increases with increase in network traffic, and for most cases, it is in the range of 25% to 50%. Using Chebyshev's theorem, at least 75% of the messages have latencies in the interval [0.5, 1.5] when = 25%, and in the interval <ref> [0, 2] </ref> when = 50%, which is clearly very high. Hence, we need some mechanisms to reduce the standard deviation. Further, it can be observed from Figure 1 that the rate of increase of standard deviation with increase in traffic is even higher than that of the average.

Reference-contexts: The effect of adaptivity on average and standard deviation of latencies has been studied by using partially adaptive (for example, West-first <ref> [9] </ref>), and fully adaptive (for example, Opt-y [13]) routing algorithms. West-first has roughly half the adaptiveness of a fully adaptive routing algorithm. <p> Opt-y also leads to an improvement in performance at high network traffic. However, the performance of West-first is similar to that of X-Y at low traffic, but is much worse at high traffic this is consistent with the observations made by Glass and Ni in <ref> [9] </ref>. 7.3.2 Considering router design complexity 17 These results are shown in Figure 8 and 9, for uniform traffic and hotspot traffic, respectively. It can be seen that for all the routing algorithms considered, the performance degradation at low network traffic is worse than in Figure 6 and 7.

Reference-contexts: One area that merits investigation is the effect of the multiplexing scheme on message latency. Our focus in this paper has been on time multiplexing. Demand multiplexing the virtual channels seems to be an attractive alternative to time multiplexing. Our preliminary investigation, reported in <ref> [11] </ref>, shows that with demand multiplexing there is a appreciable reduction in the average message latency though the standard deviation remains roughly the same, compared to time multiplexing. 9 Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank Jeff May and Roshan Rao for help with the implementation of the simulator, and Loren

Reference-contexts: It is therefore important and desirable that the variance of message latencies be kept low. In real-time parallel processing, worst case latencies are a major factor in determining how data is accessed, buffered, and transmitted in a predictable manner <ref> [12] </ref>. It is important, therefore, that for good performance, the worst case latency be as close to the average as possible. Equivalently, it is important to reduce the variance of messages in such applications. <p> Equivalently, it is important to reduce the variance of messages in such applications.

We have varied the message length, message generation frequency, traffic pattern and routing algorithm to see how well the different approaches work with different values of these parameters on a 2D-mesh topology.

Reference-contexts: Thus by modifying the priority of a message, the relative progress with which it proceeds towards its destination could be controlled. 4.2 Different Schemes Used We have considered several priority schemes, two of which, closest-first <ref> [14] </ref> and distance-traveled [8, 7] are based only on some measure of distance. <p> standard deviation of latencies is expected to decrease because the messages that have blocked more are more likely to proceed towards their destination at the cost of those that have blocked lesser. 4.2.2 Closest-First with ties broken by Blocking Delay This is similar to the closest first scheme proposed in <ref> [14] </ref>, but now we use the blocking delay to break ties, i.e., if several messages contending for an outgoing channel at a node have the same distance left to be traveled, the one with the largest value of blocking delay associated with it is allowed to reserve that channel. 5 4.2.3
