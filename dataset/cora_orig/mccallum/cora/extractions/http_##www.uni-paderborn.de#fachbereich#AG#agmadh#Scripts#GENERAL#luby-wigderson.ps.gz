Title: Pairwise Independence and Derandomization  
Author: Michael Luby and Avi Wigderson

Abstract: This set of notes gives several applications of the following paradigm. The paradigm consists of two complementary parts. The first part is to design a probabilistic algorithm described by a sequence of random variables so that the analysis is valid assuming limited independence between the random variables. The second part is the design of a small probability space for the random variables such that they are somewhat independent of each other. Thus, the analysis of the algorithm holds even when the random variables used by the algorithm are generated according to the small space.

Reference-contexts: By Equation 3, this is guaranteed to be an *-good relative estimate of f (F ) with probability at least 1 ffi. The overall running time is O ( rm 2 ffi )). Section 22: GF <ref> [2] </ref> Polynomial Counting Let y = hy 1 ; : : : ; y r i be a collection of r variables over GF [2] and let F be a polynomial over GF [2] with respect to the variables y, i.e., i.e, F = t 1 t 2 t m , <p> The overall running time is O ( rm 2 ffi )). Section 22: GF <ref> [2] </ref> Polynomial Counting Let y = hy 1 ; : : : ; y r i be a collection of r variables over GF [2] and let F be a polynomial over GF [2] with respect to the variables y, i.e., i.e, F = t 1 t 2 t m , where term t i = y i 1 fi fi y i ` i for some subset fy i 1 ; : : :; <p> The overall running time is O ( rm 2 ffi )). Section 22: GF <ref> [2] </ref> Polynomial Counting Let y = hy 1 ; : : : ; y r i be a collection of r variables over GF [2] and let F be a polynomial over GF [2] with respect to the variables y, i.e., i.e, F = t 1 t 2 t m , where term t i = y i 1 fi fi y i ` i for some subset fy i 1 ; : : :; y i ` i g of y. <p> Thus, the total running time of A 1 is O (rm 3 ln (2=ffi)=* 2 ). Theorem : Let F be a multivariate polynomial over GF <ref> [2] </ref> with no duplicate terms and m terms in total. Let H be the set of assignments to the variables that satisfy at least one term, and let H odd be the set of assignments that satisfy an odd number of terms. <p> By the way term t 1 is chosen, t 1 is the only term t i that satisfies t i " S = S, and thus q (S) = 1. We can view p () and q () as column vectors of length 2 k with entries from GF <ref> [2] </ref>, where the first entry corresponds to S 0 = ; and the last entry corresponds to S 0 = S. Then, it can be verified that there is a 2 k fi 2 k lower triangular matrix R over GF [2] with main diagonal 1 such that R fi q <p> vectors of length 2 k with entries from GF <ref> [2] </ref>, where the first entry corresponds to S 0 = ; and the last entry corresponds to S 0 = S. Then, it can be verified that there is a 2 k fi 2 k lower triangular matrix R over GF [2] with main diagonal 1 such that R fi q () = p (). In particular, row S 0 in R has a 1 in column S 00 if and only if S 00 S 0 . (See Figure 1.) Because R is invertible over GF [2] and because q () <p> matrix R over GF <ref> [2] </ref> with main diagonal 1 such that R fi q () = p (). In particular, row S 0 in R has a 1 in column S 00 if and only if S 00 S 0 . (See Figure 1.) Because R is invertible over GF [2] and because q () 6 0, it follows that for at least one S 0 S, p (S 0 ) = 1. For this S 0 , a (S 0 ) satisfies an odd number of terms. This complete the proof of the claim. <p> Note that the theorem holds even in the case when F contains the constant term 1. This fact is used in the proof of the following corollary. Corollary : Let F be a multivariate polynomial over GF <ref> [2] </ref> with no duplicate terms, no occurence of the constant term 1 and m terms in total. Let U be the set of all assignments to the variables, and let H even be the set of assignments that satisfy an even number of terms. <p> The bound given in the theorem is optimal. To see this, let m be a power of two and let F = Q Q j=log m;:::;r y j . When F is viewed as a polynomial over GF <ref> [2] </ref> and expanded out the number of terms is m. When viewed over GF [2], F = 1 has a unique solution, whereas when viewed as a DNF formula, F has m satisfying assignments. The bound given in the above corollary is also optimal. <p> To see this, let m be a power of two and let F = Q Q j=log m;:::;r y j . When F is viewed as a polynomial over GF <ref> [2] </ref> and expanded out the number of terms is m. When viewed over GF [2], F = 1 has a unique solution, whereas when viewed as a DNF formula, F has m satisfying assignments. The bound given in the above corollary is also optimal. To see this, consider F = 1 Q i=1;:::;r (1y i ). <p> The bound given in the above corollary is also optimal. To see this, consider F = 1 Q i=1;:::;r (1y i ). When F is viewed as a polynomial over GF <ref> [2] </ref> and expanded out the 1 term is cancelled and the total number of terms is m = 2 r 1. When viewed over GF [2], F = 0 has a unique solution, and thus jU j=jH even j = 2 r = m + 1. 50 Section 23: Bounded Depth <p> To see this, consider F = 1 Q i=1;:::;r (1y i ). When F is viewed as a polynomial over GF <ref> [2] </ref> and expanded out the 1 term is cancelled and the total number of terms is m = 2 r 1. When viewed over GF [2], F = 0 has a unique solution, and thus jU j=jH even j = 2 r = m + 1. 50 Section 23: Bounded Depth Circuit Counting Recall that in Sections 9-15 we introduced ways to reduce the amount of randomness when amplifying the probability of correctly deciding membership of <p> The time/success ratio of C for predicting the parity of its inputs is S C = T C =p C . The following lower bound theorem is a culmination of a number of papers, i.e., [12, Furst-Saxe-Sipser], <ref> [2, Ajtai] </ref>, [38, Yao1], [8, Cai], [17, H-astad]. <p> Note that the above corollary applies to derandomize at least partially the randomized approximation algorithm for DNF counting described in Section 21. However, the Parity Theorem does not help at all directly in derandomizing the randomized approximation algorithm for GF <ref> [2] </ref> Polynomial Counting described in Section 23, because such a polynomial can easily compute the parity of the number of ones in its input.
