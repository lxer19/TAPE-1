Reference-contexts: See, for example, (Regier 1992) or <ref> (Bailey 1994) </ref>. Jonathan Segal 8 use the English used to construction to refer to an action which only occurred once). This is as opposed to a purely declarative, feature-based model of aspect, where one would need rules and such to manipulate feature values to compute results. <p> For the sake of the aspectual distinctions, which generalize over all actions or processes, we are not interested in what the particular process is. In modeling, we assume that for each verb, the process is some model or representation of the particular semantics of that verb. Working on this, <ref> (Bailey 1994) </ref> talks about modeling the semantics of a particular class of verbs, and (Narayan 1995) talks about metaphoric semantics. So what do we need from a computational model for aspect? We want the model to be active, i.e. it must execute, and from this execution we can derive inferences.

Reference-contexts: More likely, we need to model potentiality through a computational model of Fauconnier's mental spaces <ref> (Fauconnier 1985) </ref>, which would need to be ties in to the syntactic and semantic mechanism. * once the model is built, with all the many details worked out and fixed, we need to test it, in a comprehension mode (i.e. parse sentences and construct semantic models) and possibly in a generation

As do (Lakoff 1987), <ref> (Johnson 1987) </ref>, (Quinn 1987), etc., we view language use and language acquisition, and thus word and construction meaning, to be inextricably interwoven with world knowledge and bodily and cultural experience, and how we store and access this knowledge.

Reference-contexts: If we specify how we can link certain configurations of the net to aspectual states and these to linguistic constructions, we will have a computational model for the semantics of aspect. Work is being done (in the spirit of (Narayan 1995) and <ref> (Jurafsky 1992) </ref>) on the implementation of this linking, which we represent with the Saussurian form/meaning diagram of Figure 6. We will be focusing on the schematic representations of the semantics, and how those should correspond to the K-schemantics of the constructions. For example, consider Figure 6. <p> The top half is shorthand for the syntactic information necessary to represent, in this case, the English progressive. We notate that with -ing marking, though the actual syntactic implementation is left for later work (see <ref> (Jurafsky 1992) </ref> for a sample of a syntactic computational model). We will focus our examination on the bottom half of the diagram, which represents the semantic information. 4.4 Representing the Semantics We adopt a unification model, as per (Langacker 1991) for our description of the semantics portion of the constructions.

As discussed in detail in, among other places, (Lakoff & Johnson 1980), <ref> (Lakoff 1987) </ref>, and (Quinn 1987), we use knowledge/experience/K-schemas from some domains to help structure (i.e. form K-schemas) and reason about, and thus choose words (constructions) for other domains.

Reference-contexts: In the prototypical case of this, K-schemas from more basic, more grounded domains 2 For the purposes of this paper, I will use the general term construction to include both words, morphemes, and grammatical construction, akin to Langacker <ref> (Langacker 1991) </ref> 3 Note that language itself is something we experience, so we of course form generalizations and K-schemas about language, too. Jonathan Segal 4 (e.g. bodily experience) help structure K-schemas from more complex domains. <p> We will focus our examination on the bottom half of the diagram, which represents the semantic information. 4.4 Representing the Semantics We adopt a unification model, as per <ref> (Langacker 1991) </ref> for our description of the semantics portion of the constructions.

Reference-contexts: I will now briefly describe the model proposed in (Narayan 1994). Jonathan Segal 9 4.3 Petri nets To model computationally aspectual semantics, we use Petri nets 9 . Petri nets are models for procedural systems that are characterized as concurrent, asynchronous, distributed, parallel, nondeterministic, and/or stochastic <ref> (Murata 1989) </ref>. They are finite automata, composed of places, transitions, (possibly weighted) directed arcs. Each place or transition can contain zero or more tokens. The arcs link places to transitions and transitions to places. <p> We will be focusing on the schematic representations of the semantics, and how those should correspond to the K-schemantics of the constructions. For example, consider Figure 6. The entire 9 For a complete, formal discussion of Petri nets, see <ref> (Murata 1989) </ref> or (Reisig 1982) Jonathan Segal 10 Jonathan Segal 11 diagram signifies a representation for a construction, the English Progressive construction.

Reference-contexts: We are attempting to construct a computational model of the semantics of force dynamic terms, a la (Talmy 1988). It is based on the model Srini Narayan proposed in <ref> (Narayan 1994) </ref> and (Narayan 1995), and is part of the L-zero project, described in (Feldman et al. 1993). We begin by giving a brief description and summary of work Srini Narayan (Narayan 1994), describing a computational model for the semantics of aspect. <p> It is based on the model Srini Narayan proposed in <ref> (Narayan 1994) </ref> and (Narayan 1995), and is part of the L-zero project, described in (Feldman et al. 1993). We begin by giving a brief description and summary of work Srini Narayan (Narayan 1994), describing a computational model for the semantics of aspect. Then we will talk about force dynamics, and how as a preliminary attempt to model the semantics of force dynamic terms we can extend Narayan's model. 4.1 Aspect Consider any action. <p> In addition, if possible we would like the model to have well understood computational properties. I will now briefly describe the model proposed in <ref> (Narayan 1994) </ref>. Jonathan Segal 9 4.3 Petri nets To model computationally aspectual semantics, we use Petri nets 9 .

(This view of K-schemas is very much like Quinn's view of the word cultural model (e.g. in <ref> (Quinn 1987) </ref>), and is not unlike Lakoff's use of the word concept.) But we can also generalize over more abstract things. For example, we notice that whenever we want to do something, perform some action, these actions have (usually) a beginning, and an end. <p> As we learn language for describing the world, we notice what sorts of things the language we use distinguishes, and what it doesn't. 2.1 Metaphor K-schemas are not isolated from each other.

Modeling, though is especially important when the theories under question are inherently difficult to model. <p> We are attempting to construct a computational model of the semantics of force dynamic terms, a la <ref> (Talmy 1988) </ref>. It is based on the model Srini Narayan proposed in (Narayan 1994) and (Narayan 1995), and is part of the L-zero project, described in (Feldman et al. 1993). <p> generalized aspectual schema. 5 Extensions to the model Negation and Force Dynam ics There are two main extensions to this model will be discussed: representing simple negation, and representing the semantics of force dynamic terms (force dynamic terms as a linguistic category are generalizations of the causative, as described by <ref> (Talmy 1988) </ref>). We will discuss the modeling of simple negation first, then of force dynamics. Jonathan Segal 13 5.1 The General Approach Recall that Token-flow is the life-blood of Petri nets. Tokens flow through the nets, simulating the actions. <p> Thus we have an active model emulating the semantics of the negation. 5.1.2 Force Dynamic Terms We want to model force dynamic terms, i.e. terms of generalized causation, as described in <ref> (Talmy 1988) </ref>. Sample sentences whose semantics we want to capture with the model are as in figure 9.
