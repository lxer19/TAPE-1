Abstract: NE/SQP is a recent algorithm that has proven quite effective for solving the pure and mixed forms of the nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP). NE/SQP is robust in the sense that its direction-finding subproblems are always solvable; in addition, the convergence rate of this method is Q-quadratic. In this paper we consider a generalized version of NE/SQP proposed by Pang and Qi, that is suitable for the bounded NCP. We extend their work by demonstrating a stronger convergence result and then test a proposed method on several numerical problems.

Reference-contexts: A Traffic Equilibrium Problem [TE] The general traffic equilibrium problem was formulated as a variational inequality problem in [24].

An example of an asymmetric demand function is that derived from a logit model: D ij (u) = d 0 r ij e u ij k6=i r ik e u ik with r ij = e fl ij being positive constants; see [1]. <p> commonly used in practical traffic analysis; see <ref> [1] </ref>. An example of an asymmetric demand function is that derived from a logit model: D ij (u) = d 0 r ij e u ij k6=i r ik e u ik with r ij = e fl ij being positive constants; see [1]. It should be pointed out that when the NCP (f ) with f as given above is solved by a Newton-type method (such as NE/SQP), a complete knowledge of all the paths of the traffic network is required in advance. <p> TE The vector x a matched starting point a in [7].

Reference-contexts: The UBNCP differs from the standard version in that the variables, normally bounded below by zero, are additionally bounded above. Upper bounds on the variables in an NCP are actually a frequent feature in many nonlinear programs and in energy and economic applications [22] <ref> [3] </ref> [13]. When the variables are bounded from above and below, it suffices to consider only the upper bounded version of the NCP.

Remark: In Step 1, when the condition OE (x k ; d k ) = (x k ) is met and x k is s-regular, then x k solves the UBNCP; see Proposition 10, part (c), of <ref> [18] </ref>.
