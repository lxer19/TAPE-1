Reference-contexts: We present the relationship between SO (3) and so (3), where so (3) is the set of all skew symmetric matrices. We then give definitions of Lie groups and their associated Lie algebras, and show that SO (3) is a Lie group with associated algebra so (3). <ref> [2] </ref> contains a good summary of Lie groups and rotation matrices.

Reference-contexts: It is based on the work in optimal control on Lie groups, presented in <ref> [3] </ref> and [4]. Consider a rigid body rotating in space. The state of the system, describing the orientation of the object with time, can be represented as an element g 2 SO (3).

The state of the system, describing the orientation of the object with time, can be represented as an element g 2 SO (3). <p> Suppose we wish to minimize the L 2 norm of the control, ie. minimize 1 Z 1 k u (t) k 2 dt where u = [u 1 ; u 2 ; u 3 ] T . Using the method of <ref> [4] </ref>, we use as a basis for the Lie algebra the following: X 1 = 6 0 0 0 0 1 0 7 2 4 0 0 0 3 5 X 3 = 6 0 1 0 0 0 0 7 We form the Hamiltonian H = 2 3 X X

Reference-contexts: In this section, a method is presented which performs this optimization in the Lie group, using methods of Riemannian geometry. The method to perform the optimization is presented in <ref> [6] </ref> and [7]. The method seeks a curve g : R ! SO (3) which minimizes the function 1 Z 1 k _!(t) k 2 dt where ! is the angular velocity. <p> The curve satisfies the differential equation _g (t) = g (t)^! (6) g 2 = R y (=4), g 3 = R z (=2) where ^! is the skew symmetric matrix corresponding to the angular velocity. Using a bi-invariant metric in SO (3), it is shown in <ref> [6] </ref> that a minimizing curve g : R ! SO (3) has angular velocity which satisfies the differential equation: d 3 ! d 2 ! Closed form solutions to this differential equation cannot, in general, be found. However, for some special cases these solutions can be calculated. <p> Much of the research to date in splines through Lie groups seems to use the well known notions of splining in R n and extends this through the exponential map to the Lie group. There are some exceptions, namely <ref> [6] </ref>, [7], [8], and [9] (where quaternions are used). It would be interesting to study in more depth how subdivision and refinement algorithms (such as Oslo or de Casteljau) would evolve on a Lie group.
