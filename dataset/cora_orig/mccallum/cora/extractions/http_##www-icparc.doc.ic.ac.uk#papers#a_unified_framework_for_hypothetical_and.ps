Abstract: We describe here a general and flexible framework for decision making which embodies the concepts of beliefs, goals, options, arguments and commitments. We have employed these concepts to build a generic decision support system which has been successfully applied in a number of areas in clinical medicine. In this paper, we present the formalisation of the decision making architecture within a framework of modal propositional logics. A possible-world semantics of the logic is developed and the soundness and completeness result is also established.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A decision is a choice between two or more competing hypotheses about some world or possible courses of action in the world. A decision support system is a computerised system which helps decision makers by utilizing knowledge about the world to recommend beliefs or actions <ref> [1] </ref>. Such a system when built on symbolic theory [4] offers a general and flexible framework for decision making. The theory embodies the concepts of beliefs and goals of decision makers, represents options to satisfy a goal, argues for and against for every option and commits to a suitable option. <p> Then the argument elderly =&gt; support (cancer, d1) specifies that if a person is believed to be elderly then this argument confers evidence level d1 on the candidate cancer. We might consider d1 as a member of the quantitative dictionary of probabilities dict (P rob) = def <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. However, there is no requirement that we should restrict dictionaries to dict (P rob). Among the obvious dictionaries we may consider is dict (Qual) = def f+; ++g. As mentioned, a dictionary has always a top element to represent the highest support for arguments.

Reference-contexts: The logic LR 2 L enriches the propositional calculus by the introduction of a number of appropriately specialized modal operators and its semantics are well defined. This kind of modal formalism has the major advantage that its possible-world semantics <ref> [2, 16, 17] </ref> reflects the dynamic nature of applications such as medicine. In the implementation, decision making and scheduling processes are performed by an LR 2 L theorem prover. The paper is organized as follows. We present the R 2 L language in the following section 2.

First of all, the following two propositions prove that the validity in a class of models is preserved by the use of the rule of inference and the axioms of LR 2 L. Proposition 4.

Reference-contexts: Instances of propositional tautologies may involve any number of modal operators, for example, hbelip ! hbelip. We have the modus ponens inference rule and adopt a set of standard axioms of beliefs which can be found in <ref> [5, 11, 14, 18] </ref>: :hbeli ? (1) hbeliF ^ hbeli (F ! G) ! hbeliG (2) hbeliF ! hbelihbeliF (3) :hbeliF ! hbeli:hbeliF (4) Axiom (1) expresses that an inconsistency is not believable by a decision maker. The derivation of the symbol ? from the database implies inconsistency. <p> The reason for exclusion will be given in the context of model definition. The exclusion also avoids the unnecessary contributions to the aggregation process for F . We adopt the following two standard axioms of goals <ref> [5, 19] </ref>: :hgoali ? (9) hgoaliF ^ hgoali (F ! G) ! hgoaliG (10) Axiom (9) says that something that is impossible to achieve cannot be a goal of a decision maker. Axiom (10) states that all the logical consequences of a decision maker's goal are goals themselves. Proposition 3. <p> Proposition 3. The following are theorems of LR 2 L: hgoaliF ^ hbeli (F ! G) ! hgoaliG hgoali (F ^ G) $ hgoaliF ^ hgoaliG hgoaliF _ hgoaliG ! hgoali (F _ G) hgoaliF ! :hgoali:F hgoaliF ! :hbeli:F According to <ref> [5] </ref>, worlds compatible with a decision maker's goals must be included in those compatible with the decision maker's beliefs. This is summarised in the following axiom: hbeliF ! hgoaliF (11) A database is full of decision maker's belief.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the axiom hsup 4 iF ! hbeliF . should be considered for a rational decision maker. This axiom, of course, derives that an assertion and its negation are not simultaneously derivable with the top element as support, that is, an integrity constraint <ref> [6] </ref> of the form hsup 4 iF ^ hsup 4 i:F !?. It is difficult to maintain consistency of a database in the presence of this axiom, particularly when the database is constructed from different sources; mutual inconsistency and mistakes sometimes need to be tolerated.

Reference-contexts: This demonstrates that, in general, hw; d1; W 0 i 2 R s does not necessarily mean hw; d2; W 0 i 2 R s , for d2 d1. Aggregation of arguments introduces a hierarchy of preferences <ref> [7] </ref> among the set of all possible worlds accessible from w by the relation R b . The maximal elements and possibly some elements from the top of the hierarchy of this preference structure will be called goal worlds.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 2. The decision making architecture Domino Model We have proposed a high-level and expressive language called R 2 L (RED Representational Language) <ref> [8] </ref> to be used by knowledge engineers who wish to encode knowledge and beliefs of a particular application domain for decision making based on the above scheme. R 2 L explicitly supports the key concepts required in our framework, such as beliefs, goals, arguments and commitments. <p> When we are committed to scheduling a plan, the plan involves executing constituent subplans and actions in a certain order. For example, if we schedule chemotherapy then a plan construct <ref> [8] </ref> of R 2 L guides us to achieve the goal of carrying out the chemotherapy plan.

Reference-contexts: The theory embodies the concepts of beliefs and goals of decision makers, represents options to satisfy a goal, argues for and against for every option and commits to a suitable option. We have employed this theory to build a generic decision support system <ref> [9, 13] </ref>. A paper focussing on applications of the theory to clinical medicine has also been submitted to this conference [12]. The scope of our decision framework is illustrated by the simple medical example in Figure 1. <p> For example, if we schedule chemotherapy then a plan construct [8] of R 2 L guides us to achieve the goal of carrying out the chemotherapy plan. Formalisation of this aspect involving actions and temporal reasoning is presented elsewhere <ref> [9] </ref> and is out of the scope of this paper. 3 Argumentation and Aggregation In classical logic an argument is a sequence of inferences leading to a conclusion. <p> A plan construct in R 2 L would have been transformed to a set of temporal rules of LR 2 L <ref> [9] </ref> involving action symbols. Reasoning with time and actions is out of scope of the current, as we are concentrating primarily on the process of decision making. 6 Axioms of LR 2 L We consider every instance of a propositional tautology to be an axiom. <p> A discussion detailing the advantage of our approach over the traditional statistical decision theory (e.g. expected utility theory) and knowledge-based (expert) systems can be found in <ref> [9] </ref>. Although we have focussed on the decision making component of our model in this paper, the theory can be expanded into a general formalism incorporating actions and temporal reasoning. This aspect has been described elsewhere [9, 10]. <p> Although we have focussed on the decision making component of our model in this paper, the theory can be expanded into a general formalism incorporating actions and temporal reasoning.

Our formal model of decision making has already been successfully used in decision support applications in the domains of cancer and asthma protocol management [12]. In these applications, a human decision maker has over-riding control of the management process.

Reference-contexts: An argument schema is like an ordinary rule with support (F, &lt;degree&gt;) as its consequent, where &lt;degree&gt; is drawn from a dictionary of qualitative or quantitative measures of support, and indicates the support conferred on this candidate by the argument <ref> [15] </ref>. A commitment rule will often, though not necessarily, make use of the meta-predicate netsupport such as above. This meta-predicate has the general form netsupport (F, &lt;support&gt;). <p> This meta-predicate has the general form netsupport (F, &lt;support&gt;). It computes the total support for the specified candidate using an aggregation algorithm (discussed in the following section) selected from a library of such algorithms <ref> [15] </ref>. When a commitment rule involves the netsupport as in the above example, the computation of its truth value involves meta-level reasoning whose formalisation is beyond the scope of this paper. A dictionary is a set of symbols which can be used to label a proposition. <p> For example, elements ++ and 1 are the top elements of the two dictionaries dict (Qual) and dict (P rob) respectively. A number of different dictionaries for reasoning under uncertainty have been discussed in <ref> [15] </ref>, together with their mathemati cal foundations and their relation to classical probability and other uncertainty formalisms. A commitment rule is like an ordinary rule with one of add (&lt;property&gt;) or schedule (&lt;plan&gt;) as its consequent. <p> The usual interest of the logician is in procedures by which arguments may be used to establish the validity (truth or falsity) of a formula. In LA, a logic of argument <ref> [15] </ref>, arguments do not necessarily prove formulae but may merely indicate support for (or doubt about) them. Also in classical logic, so long as we can construct one argument (proof) for F, any further arguments for F are of no interest. <p> In our system all distinct arguments of candidates are of interest (intuitively, the more arguments we have for F the greater is our knowledge about the validity of F). We therefore distinguish distinct arguments by identifying the unique grounds of each (essentially a normalised proof term in LA <ref> [15] </ref>) and a sign drawn from some dictionary which indicates the support provided to F by the argument. An example of an R 2 L argument is elderly =&gt; support (cancer, d1), where F is cancer, the ground is elderly =&gt; cancer and the support is d1.
