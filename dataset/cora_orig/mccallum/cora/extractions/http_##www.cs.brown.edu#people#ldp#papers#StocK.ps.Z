Reference-contexts: First we choose an order p of autoregressive model, then fit coefficients ff i using Whittle's recursion form of the Yule-Walker equations 5 <ref> [Spl, 1993] </ref>. Then we compute AIC (see Section 3.8) and start all over, trying to find a model with minimal AIC. External loop is an easy one dimensional optimization usually in the range p 2 [1::20] 6 . Second step is an iterative procedure giving one coefficient per iteration. <p> method is so-called portmanteau test statistic Q (addressed as P-value in Splus): Q = n k=1 k ; where K is a fixed number of lags and n is the number of observations in the series. [Box and Jenkins, 1976] suggest that K is chosen between 15 and 30, while <ref> [Spl, 1993] </ref> recommends that K should be between 10 and 20. If the fitted model is appropriate, then Q should be approximately distributed as 2 with (K pq) degrees of freedom, where p, q are respectively the order of AR and MA parts in the model.

Reference-contexts: ARMA model can be presented as a State-Space model. Figure 7 illustrates a state-space model corresponding to ARMA (2,1), where observable variable x t depends on x t1 and x t2 and white noise * t and * t1 . 3.7 ARIMA model <ref> [Box and Jenkins, 1976] </ref> developed ARIMA model which first detrends a process by differencing and then fits an ARMA model into it. ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive 3 MODELS FORMULATION 12 Integrated Moving Average. <p> Specifically, r is the number of AR, MA, and regression coefficients. Another method is so-called portmanteau test statistic Q (addressed as P-value in Splus): Q = n k=1 k ; where K is a fixed number of lags and n is the number of observations in the series. <ref> [Box and Jenkins, 1976] </ref> suggest that K is chosen between 15 and 30, while [Spl, 1993] recommends that K should be between 10 and 20.

Reference-contexts: For a non-stationary time series values of ^(k) will not come down except for very large values of the lag, this is the case for SP, GE and IBM on Figure 2. and attenuates" and decay pretty fast which according to <ref> [Chatfield, 1989] </ref> suggests autoregressive or ARMA model of low order.

Reference-contexts: One subset is used for training a model choosing an order and adjusting coefficients, another subset is used for testing. We have to use simple validation instead of cross-validation as described in <ref> [Dean et al., 1995] </ref> because of time-critical character of our data. We took 600 data points as a training subset and 20 points as a testing subset.

Reference-contexts: In our case all stocks were nonstationary and after all detrending transformations they left nonstationary in variance. To overcome this problem, we need a proper variance stabilizing transformation. This question is not so well developed as detrending, some ways of variance stabilizing are described in <ref> [Wei, 1990] </ref>. Another factor which influences the variance is sales volume. Sometimes there are outliers in time series which correspond to odd price achieved on a trade of a small volume.
