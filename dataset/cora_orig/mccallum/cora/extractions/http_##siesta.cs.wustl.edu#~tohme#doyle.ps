Title: The possibility of an universal rational reasoner  
Author: Fernando Tohme 
Address: del Sur  
Affiliation: Departamento de Economa Universidad Nacional  
Abstract: Reasoning in complex domains may provide inconsistent conclusions. Notwithstanding, in such cases several maximally consistent sets of conclusions can be shown to exist. Any method of reasoning used in Artificial Intelligence choses only one of these sets. In this paper we will analyze the possibility of the existence of an universal method, able to chose the right option for each problem. It will be shown that an argument derived from Social Choice Theory can be applied here: as each known method provides an implicit preferential ordering of sets of conclusions, an aggregation procedure which allows a global partial order exists according to an extension of Arrow's Theorem.

Reference-contexts: This calls again Doyle, instead, requires from his aggregation process to provide a weak global order and formulates (as was said) an impossibility theorem implying that partial orders can not be aggregated in a weak order. He bases his affirmation on the following (Arrow's impossibility) theorem <ref> [6] </ref>: Theorem 1 There exists no satisfying the conditions 1; : : : ; 4 above if j S j 3 and the i are weak orders In the proof of this theorem plays a significative role the notion of decisive set: Definition 6 G I is decisive iff 8a; b

Reference-contexts: As was said, Doyle derives a dictatorial result, which implies that is an ultrafilter. But as was said forms a filter in the case of individual partial orders. So "Doyle's Impossibility Theorem" means that there are no proper filters i.e. that each filter is an ultrafilter <ref> [7] </ref>. This does not mean that partial orders can be in every case be aggregated in a weak order. Instead it means that in most cases a partial global order of extensions will obtain.
