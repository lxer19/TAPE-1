Title: A position calibration of AMANDA-B holes 11-13

Keyword: 2) A Summary of Hole Reconstruction Methods  
Note: 1) 1998 Drill Data  
Abstract: We received drill data obtained from the three holes drilled in the 1997-1998 season. It was hoped that in drilling this season, we would retrieve more drill data than in past years so that the holes could be reconstructed more accurately. More data allows for greater resolution in the reconstruction, especially during drill reaming runs, as the drill proceeds quickly during reaming. We obtained nearly one gigabyte of data from hole 11 due to alterations made in this season's drill control code. Holes 12 and 13 were drilled using an older version of the drill control code, so the data sets retrieved from these holes were approximately equal in size to data sets from previous seasons (approximately 100 to 200 megabytes in size). The drill sends a data string to the surface which is logged by the computer which controls the operation of the drill. This data string includes drill pendulum measurements, drill temperature and caliper measurements, drill heading measurements and drill magnetic field measurements. To reconstruct the drill's path, we extract these data measurements from each drill data string. From surface winch measurements, we obtain a payout measurement-how far the drill moved in the z-direction during a given period of time. With this data in hand, the drill's path in the ice can be determined. Each drill pendulum measurement (hereafter referred to as bank and elevation measurements) is associated with a payout value. For instance, if the payout (depth) value is -10.0 meters, the bank and elevation measurements might be +0.01 degrees and -0.05 degrees respectively at this particular depth. These degree values indicate how far the drill tilts in any given direction off of precisely vertical. By determining in which direction the drill tilts and how far the
