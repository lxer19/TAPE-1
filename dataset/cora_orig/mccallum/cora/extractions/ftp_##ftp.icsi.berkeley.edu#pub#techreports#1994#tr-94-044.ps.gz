Abstract: In this report we analyze the feature binding problem, a combinatorial complexity problem that affects connectionist networks using multiple topographic representations of an image. Inspired from some evidence about the human visual system, we suggest that a solution to this problem may derive by the combined use of attention mechanisms and by exploiting the temporal synchrony of neuronal firing. To this end, a new framework is proposed in terms of a neuronal model, and of a computational architecture capable of producing synchronized firing in distributed assemblies of neurons. This synchronized behavior only affects neurons selected by the network to represent objects of interest. The architecture is structured into a set of feature, conspicuity, and saliency maps, whose neurons are connected in a feedback loop. A number of mechanisms are proposed in order to implement each of these stages, including strategies for reinforcing the synchronous firing of the selected neurons.

Reference-contexts: This feedback is likely to mediate the facilitatory effect observed on the selected region of attention. Several mechanisms have been suggested for the feedback, such as excitatory connections to neurons of the selected area, inhibition of the non-selected neurons, routing of the selected region to the higher cortical areas <ref> [1] </ref>, and generation of highly-correlated spike trains [4]. It should be clear that this attentional mechanism could provide a direct solution to the binding problem. <p> implement these stochastic components through Normal (Gaussian) deviates: p i (t) = P rob (neuron n i spikes at time t) = n0 A i (t n i ) 2 n i ) ; (5) where W (~) is a window function that is 0 everywhere, except in the interval <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, in which it is 1. This means that each Gaussian component is bounded to the interval defined by extrema n ! i 2! i ; n = 1; 2; :::. <p> The general rules for the definition of the initial values has been qualitatively described in section 5. Since the intensity values of all feature map F k x;y ; k = 1; ::; K are restricted to the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, these rules can easily be implemented in the following way: ! k x;y ) + ! min (7) x;y (0) = ( max min ) z (1 F k k x;y ) + min ; (9) where min ; max ; ! min ; ! max ; min ; <p> The function z (~) : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! [0; 1] may be simply the identity function, for a uniform quantization of the intensity values. <p> The function z (~) : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! [0; 1] may be simply the identity function, for a uniform quantization of the intensity values. Alternatively, it may be useful to better discriminate between high-intensity values or low-intensity ones, in which cases, the functions z (~) = ~ 2 and z (~) = ~ may for instance be used. <p> It may thus be possible to integrate the conspicuity maps by simply defining the intensity of the saliency map neurons through a weighted sum: S x;y (nt ) = K k=0 x;y (nt ); (13) where the weights w k 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> may either be constant or, if some a-priori knowledge is available, may favor features that are known to characterize a target object. However, there is still the possibility that the same conspicuity map may detect multiple objects at the same time. <p> This can be done through the following updating rule: t x;y (t) = ( k x;y ): (15) The first term represents the feedback that affects all locations at which the saliency map has a high value. The values of S x;y are mapped into <ref> [0; 1] </ref> through a squashing function such as s (~) = 1=(1 + exp (~ )), whose value is about zero everywhere, except for values of saliency that exceed a threshold , for which it is 1.

Reference-contexts: Several models of neurons have been proposed, that can produce oscillatory behaviors. The simplest ones are mathematical abstractions that consider each neuron as an oscillator , which can be uniquely described at each time by its amplitude, phase, and frequency parameters (see for instance [15] <ref> [2] </ref>). The advantage of this representation is that it makes it easier to mathematically analyze the behaviors of multiple coupled neurons. Another class of models that allow the generation of oscillations is based on assemblies of two coupled neurons forming dipoles (cf. figure 7, left). <p> Some work has also been done recently to show how these mechanisms can be used to solve practical problems. One of them is the problem of texture segregation, for which an architecture has been proposed, in which the input image is first convolved with a bank of Gabor filters <ref> [2] </ref> (in a similar way to [19]). The responses of the convolution with these filters can be used as the amplitude values for a corresponding bank of oscillators. The phases of the oscillators interact by means of connections between each unit and some neighboring units within the 10 same map. <p> Other models have been proposed, that are possibly more structured, in that they use multiple maps and complex connection schemes, such as <ref> [2] </ref>. However, the lack of inter-map connections in this system prevents from synchronizing neurons in different maps, and eventually from binding the corresponding features. Multiple maps with inter-map connections schemes are indeed proposed in several architectures based on dipoles units (e.g. [21]). <p> The second novelty of the proposed framework is the neuronal model for the feature maps. Each neuron is characterized by a probabilistic description of its firing time, whose initial parameters are determined by convolution of the image with a filter bank. With respect to previous abstract models such as <ref> [2] </ref> [15], the proposed one makes explicit use of different frequencies in neuronal firings, in addition to different phases.

Reference-contexts: In addition to abstract oscillators and oscillating dipoles, other neuronal models exist which can produce synchronization. One of them is a refined version of the sigma-pi unit, which converts the input signal into spike trains <ref> [6] </ref>. This unit has two types of inputs, provided by feeding and linking synapses. The first ones represent the main, sensory-driven signal path, whereas the second ones act as amplifier, causing a shift in the phase of the output pulses.

In any case, attention appears to be a necessary mechanism for the brain in order to perform some basic functions.

Reference-contexts: This mechanism may also be used to improve the performance of the attention system, in particular the integration of multiple conspicuity maps. Below, we briefly review some 6 fundamental literature in both the biological and engineering fields related to neuronal oscillations (for more extensive reviews, see [30] <ref> [16] </ref> [28]). 3.1 The biology of neuronal oscillations Oscillatory dynamics in the brain have long been observed and analyzed, for instance through the electroencephalogram.

If these neurons are connected in an excitatory all-to-all fashion with a global inhibition, they synchronize their bursts whenever a sufficient number of input signals coincide. It is interesting that, as a consequence of this synchronization, oscillations in the network activity tend to emerge spontaneously.

Reference-contexts: On one extreme, the choice of abstract oscillators makes their use simpler, on the other hand, more detailed models, such as the Hodgkin-Huxley one, would be more plausible, and may offer richer behaviors (see for instance <ref> [18] </ref>). Models such as the oscillating dipole are somewhat in between, combining a certain level of detail with some intuitive understanding of their dynamics. However, the choice of dipoles is not qualitatively different from abstract oscillators, since it is not necessarily more plausible from the biological point of view.

Reference-contexts: with artificial neural networks (cf. next section). 3.2 Oscillations in neural networks Independently from the discovery of visually-evoked 40 Hz oscillations in the brain, oscillatory dynamics had already been introduced in artificial neural networks to solve difficult tasks, such as the problem of segregating auditory patterns originated from multiple speakers <ref> [20] </ref> and the possibility to perform reflexive reasoning using connectionist networks [29]. Interest in these topics has recently increased considerably, in particular with the purpose of developing computational models able to reproduce the neurobiological results. Several models of neurons have been proposed, that can produce oscillatory behaviors.

Reference-contexts: The activity of the u unit will then again increase, thanks to the sustained input. The differential equations defining the dynamics of the dipole require the specification of several parameters, which must be carefully chosen in order to obtain the desired behavior (cf. <ref> [21] </ref> for more details). Another way to generate oscillatory dynamics is by introducing temporal delays in the connections between the excitatory and inhibitory neurons (cf. figure 7, right). <p> More global connection schemes can be obtained by simply increasing the number of these associative connections for each dipole. Another extension of this connection scheme allows the possibility to either synchronize or desynchronize dipoles. This is done by adding excitatory connections to a common inhibitor unit v <ref> [21] </ref> (cf. figure 8, right). It has been shown that, if the strength of the connections to the v unit is high enough, the two dipoles become desynchronized, i.e. their coefficient of correlation is very low. <p> Examples of networks which do contain this kind of lateral inter-map connections can be found in [12] [8]. Another interesting applications of coupled oscillators is in figure-ground segregation. The architecture proposed in <ref> [21] </ref> consists of multiple 2-D arrays F k x;y of oscillators, each value of k representing a different feature. Within each map k, all oscillators are linked with each other through excitatory connections. This also holds for all units at the same location x; y in different maps. <p> However, the lack of inter-map connections in this system prevents from synchronizing neurons in different maps, and eventually from binding the corresponding features. Multiple maps with inter-map connections schemes are indeed proposed in several architectures based on dipoles units (e.g. <ref> [21] </ref>). However, in these cases the lack of attention mechanisms strictly limits the number of distinct phases/frequencies on which neurons may synchronize. This means that in all these models synchronization may only occur in very simplified images, for instance images contains one or two uniform objects on a uniform background.

Reference-contexts: Several metaphores have been used to describe these facilitatory effects on selected parts of the input, in terms of a variable zoom-lens [7], or of a spotlight mechanism [14] [32] [36] that can be moved about the retinal image to highlight some parts of it (see <ref> [22] </ref> for a more extensive survey). In any case, attention appears to be a necessary mechanism for the brain in order to perform some basic functions. <p> A computational analysis of the complexity of the recognition task, for instance, reveals the need for a sequential selection process, since there are not enough neurons to perform it in parallel <ref> [22] </ref> [33]. Besides the limitation of processing resources, visual attention is also required by some direct links that exist between the visual and motor cortices. <p> how the problem described in the previous section can be solved whenever the attention region containing a single object is used as a gating signal. 2.1 A computational model of visual attention In this section, a computational model of visual attention that has previously been proposed is briefly described (see <ref> [22] </ref> [23] for more details). This model combines bottom-up and top-down cues into a single representation called the saliency map. The integration of these cues is performed through a relaxation process that iteratively modifies multiple measures of interest obtained for each location according to different criteria. <p> 1-D index used above to identify neurons will be replaced by an "x; y" one, identifying their 2-D position. 6.1 Computing feature map intensities In a previous simulation of the attention system, the following feature maps had been proposed: local orientation, edge magnitude, curvature, and red-green, blue-yellow color opponency maps <ref> [22] </ref> [23]. In the present context, we propose the use of the same maps, with some modifications in the definition of the orientation one. <p> Another differential operator is used to compute the intensity for the curvature feature map: F curv x;y = div rI krIk i (x; y), where rI is the gradient of the input image. Finally, two color-opponency filters with a Gaussian profile were used in <ref> [22] </ref> to compute the color contrast feature maps. <p> These spikes represent the input to the neurons in the conspicuity maps, whose goal is to select, from each feature map, the locations containing the most salient information. In <ref> [22] </ref> [23] a strategy has been proposed for the calculation of these maps, for the case of case of instantaneous, synchronous processing. <p> In <ref> [22] </ref> [23] a method was proposed for the construction of the saliency map, based on a relaxation process run over the conspicuity maps (cf. section 2.1). In the present context this process, based on an iterative energy-minimization procedure, may not be necessary. <p> However it is possible that, especially for input images containing noisy, highly textured patterns, more complex schemes may be needed for the integration of the conspicuity maps. In these cases, some adapted version of the relaxation process introduced in <ref> [22] </ref> may be implemented, by means of lateral intra-map and inter-map connections between conspicuity map neurons. The advantage, with respect to the instantaneous, synchronous framework of [22] is that one or two iterations of this recursive connection scheme would be sufficient to reduce noise and to select the target region. <p> In these cases, some adapted version of the relaxation process introduced in <ref> [22] </ref> may be implemented, by means of lateral intra-map and inter-map connections between conspicuity map neurons. The advantage, with respect to the instantaneous, synchronous framework of [22] is that one or two iterations of this recursive connection scheme would be sufficient to reduce noise and to select the target region. We suggest that the strengths of the intra-map connections may define some center-surround receptive fields, with a very wide negative lobe. <p> For instance, the mechanisms proposed for each step need to be extensively evaluated by testing them on a variety of input images. The pros and cons of this strategy with respect to the instantaneous, synchronous framework of the previous attention system <ref> [22] </ref> will also have to be assessed. As far as the theoretical model 23 is concerned, more work will be required in order to define a rapid relaxation algorithm for the integration of the conspicuity maps.

Reference-contexts: the problem described in the previous section can be solved whenever the attention region containing a single object is used as a gating signal. 2.1 A computational model of visual attention In this section, a computational model of visual attention that has previously been proposed is briefly described (see [22] <ref> [23] </ref> for more details). This model combines bottom-up and top-down cues into a single representation called the saliency map. The integration of these cues is performed through a relaxation process that iteratively modifies multiple measures of interest obtained for each location according to different criteria. <p> index used above to identify neurons will be replaced by an "x; y" one, identifying their 2-D position. 6.1 Computing feature map intensities In a previous simulation of the attention system, the following feature maps had been proposed: local orientation, edge magnitude, curvature, and red-green, blue-yellow color opponency maps [22] <ref> [23] </ref>. In the present context, we propose the use of the same maps, with some modifications in the definition of the orientation one. <p> These spikes represent the input to the neurons in the conspicuity maps, whose goal is to select, from each feature map, the locations containing the most salient information. In [22] <ref> [23] </ref> a strategy has been proposed for the calculation of these maps, for the case of case of instantaneous, synchronous processing. <p> In [22] <ref> [23] </ref> a method was proposed for the construction of the saliency map, based on a relaxation process run over the conspicuity maps (cf. section 2.1). In the present context this process, based on an iterative energy-minimization procedure, may not be necessary.

Reference-contexts: In each region selected by covert attention, visual processing is affected in a number of ways. From a neurophysiological viewpoint, attended neurons provide stronger responses or, if the relevant stimulus is not within their receptive field, their responses are strongly attenuated <ref> [24] </ref>. On the psychophysical side, a number of studies have shown higher performances (for instance, shorter reaction times) if attention is allowed to move (or is artificially drawn) to a relevant region of the visual field.

Reference-contexts: The model introduced above requires 3-4 steps for the computation of the feature and conspicuity maps, plus a number of iterations for the relaxation process, usually within a dozen. Although it is relatively fast compared to previous approaches (for instance <ref> [25] </ref>), its time scales are not yet fully plausible. Another limitation of the system is due to the properties of the relaxation process.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the assemblies of neurons representing a single pattern oscillate in a phase-locked way, and those representing different patterns have different phases, allowing the network to separate these patterns in time. Finally, oscillatory neuronal models have also been studied in conjunction with attention mechanisms <ref> [26] </ref> [27]. In the first of these studies, the firing rate of V1 neurons is modeled with an inhomogeneous Poisson process, with a sinusoidal mean firing rate. The amplitude of the sinusoidal function is assumed to be determined by a measure of interest provided by some external saliency map. <p> An alternative is to consider the model p k x;y (t) as a mean firing rate, and to define F k x;y through a stochastic process P which is a function of p k x;y (t). One example for such a P process is the Poisson distribution (cf. <ref> [26] </ref> [27]). <p> Although the relationships between attention and synchronization have been formulated several years ago (see for instance [4]), very little work has been done in this direction. One interesting exception is represented by <ref> [26] </ref> [27] (cf. section 3.2), in which an external saliency map is used to enforce neuronal synchronization within a single feature map that simply reproduces the retina. Other models have been proposed, that are possibly more structured, in that they use multiple maps and complex connection schemes, such as [2].

Reference-contexts: This mechanism may also be used to improve the performance of the attention system, in particular the integration of multiple conspicuity maps. Below, we briefly review some 6 fundamental literature in both the biological and engineering fields related to neuronal oscillations (for more extensive reviews, see [30] [16] <ref> [28] </ref>). 3.1 The biology of neuronal oscillations Oscillatory dynamics in the brain have long been observed and analyzed, for instance through the electroencephalogram. Oscillations appear to take place around a number of central frequencies, from a few Hz (so called ffi range), up to 40 Hz (also called fl range).

Reference-contexts: networks Independently from the discovery of visually-evoked 40 Hz oscillations in the brain, oscillatory dynamics had already been introduced in artificial neural networks to solve difficult tasks, such as the problem of segregating auditory patterns originated from multiple speakers [20] and the possibility to perform reflexive reasoning using connectionist networks <ref> [29] </ref>. Interest in these topics has recently increased considerably, in particular with the purpose of developing computational models able to reproduce the neurobiological results. Several models of neurons have been proposed, that can produce oscillatory behaviors.

One one hand, as suggested in <ref> [30] </ref>, oscillations may just occur as a consequence of synchrony. On the other hand, it may simply be easier to produce synchronization from regular periodic patterns rather than from aperiodic ones. In any case, it remains to establish what mechanisms allow the generation of synchronization and/or oscillations.

Reference-contexts: As suggested in <ref> [31] </ref>, one or two spikes may be sufficient for each neuron in the pathway from the retina to area IT, in order to recognize a relevant pattern.

Reference-contexts: A computational analysis of the complexity of the recognition task, for instance, reveals the need for a sequential selection process, since there are not enough neurons to perform it in parallel [22] <ref> [33] </ref>. Besides the limitation of processing resources, visual attention is also required by some direct links that exist between the visual and motor cortices.

Reference-contexts: An empirical demostration of phase locking properties of this scheme is given in <ref> [34] </ref>. More global connection schemes can be obtained by simply increasing the number of these associative connections for each dipole. Another extension of this connection scheme allows the possibility to either synchronize or desynchronize dipoles. <p> In addition, if the units are oscillators, it has been shown that it is possible to recognize multiple patterns, even if they are presented simultaneously <ref> [34] </ref>. In this case, the assemblies of neurons representing a single pattern oscillate in a phase-locked way, and those representing different patterns have different phases, allowing the network to separate these patterns in time. Finally, oscillatory neuronal models have also been studied in conjunction with attention mechanisms [26] [27].

Another illusion, called the Pulfrich effect, is obtained by viewing a swinging pendulum with a light-attenuating filter before only one eye [3].
