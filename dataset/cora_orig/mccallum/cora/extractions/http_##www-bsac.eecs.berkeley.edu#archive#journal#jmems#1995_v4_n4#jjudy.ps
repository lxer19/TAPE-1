Abstract: A microactuator technology that combines magnetic thin films with polysilicon exural structures is described. Devices are constructed in a batch-fabrication process that combines electroplating with conventional lithography, materials, and equipment. A microactuator consisting of a 400x(47-40)x7 mm 3 rectangular plate of NiFe attached to a 400x(0.9-1.4)x2.25 mm 3 polysilicon cantilever beam has been displaced over 1.2 mm, rotated over 180, and actuated with over 0.185 nNm of torque. The microactuator is capable of motion both in and out of the wafer plane and has been operated in a conductive uid environment. Theoretical expressions for the displacement and torque are developed and compared to experimental results.

Reference-contexts: I. INTRODUCTION AGNETIC microactuation has recently been dem onstrated by several research groups [1-6]. In most cases magnetic-microactuator fabrication is not accomplished in a continuous batch process, but rather with the addition of steps such as manual assembly. The cantilever actuator described by Ahn and Allen is an exception <ref> [3] </ref>. We describe here batch-fabricated magnetic microactua-tors which are made in a relatively simple process [7]. This process combines electroplated NiFe films with surface-micromachined polycrystalline silicon, a combination of materials that provides new opportunities for actuated-structure designs.

Reference-contexts: The NiFe is electroplated by using a variation of a procedure, described by Ahn, Kim, and Allen <ref> [4] </ref>, to obtain 80% Ni and 20% Fe, except for the omission of one component, saccharin. Most films exhibited a significant stress gradient that caused portions of the film to peel.

In addition, forces and displacements that are larger than those generated by most electrostatic microactuators are readily obtained.

Reference-contexts: These advantages of magnetic drive can accelerate and broaden the already impressive results obtained with actuated polysilicon microexural elements [8-10]. Liu et. al have recently applied similar technology to arrays of actuators for ow-stream control on aircraft wing surfaces <ref> [11] </ref>. Integration of magnetically actuated elements into microsystems will add new dimensions to MEMS. There appears to be no major obstacle to the merger of electrical, mechanical, and magnetic microfabrication technologies. Manuscript received March 13, 1995; revised June 16, 1995.

TECHNOLOGY The magnetically actuated polysilicon structures, shown in Figs. 1 and 2, are produced by adding fabrication steps to a process developed at the Berkeley Sensor & Actuator Center (BSAC) to produce polysilicon surface-parallel microresonant systems <ref> [12] </ref>. All steps are added near the end of the fabrication sequence, just prior to the micromechanical-device release step. This processing sequence avoids contamination by the magnetic material during the conventional microelectronic and micromechanical fabrication steps. Furthermore, no additional step adds significantly to the thermal budget for the wafer. <p> V. FABRICATION As stated in Section II, magnetic elements were fabricated in steps added at the end of a process that had been developed initially to produce polysilicon resonant structures <ref> [12] </ref>. With only the final release step for mechanical structures remaining, an adhesion layer (10 nm of Cr) and an electroplating seed layer (100 nm Cu) are deposited by evaporation on top of the polysilicon exure (Fig. 9a).

Reference-contexts: Plating control to achieve a given composition is challenging, and the films turned out to be rich in nickel -- roughly 95% Ni and 5% Fe as measured by an energy-dispersive, x-ray microanalysis system mounted in a scanning-electron microscope <ref> [14] </ref>. This nickel-rich film exhibited a relatively wide B-H loop, shown in Fig. 4, with a coercivity H c of 1 kA/m (12.5 Oe) and a saturating field of 3 kA/m (37.5 Oe).

Reference-contexts: The addition of 50% nickel provides improved corrosion resistance and corresponds to a local maximum of the saturation magnetization (Figure 3). A nickel-iron alloy with 50% nickel and 50% iron has historically been referred to as 50 Permalloy <ref> [15] </ref>. A design concern for nonreleased structures made with 50 Permalloy is that the magnetostriction is much higher at 50% nickel (~2.6x10 -5 ) than at 81% nickel (~0). <p> The 100 mm-long paramecium shown near the microactuator was manipulated by the device. Paramecium magnetic field (Fig 4), such that M is reduced from M s at low fields (H ext &lt; 2 kA/m). This effect is made more pronounced by the demagnetization field <ref> [15] </ref> associated with the shape of the magnetic material. Second, the effective magnetic charges are assumed to be located at the very ends of the magnet. In practice the magnetic charges are distributed in a volume located near the ends of the magnet.

Reference-contexts: The fabrication process that forms the polysilicon beam produces a trapezoidal cross section with the wide side of the trapezoid towards the substrate. Using the moment-of-inertia of a beam with a trapezoidal cross section <ref> [17] </ref>, the angular deection in Eq. (1) can be expressed as (2) with beam thickness h, upper-beam width a, and lower-beam width b. Equation (2) is useful for determining the torque T from observation of the angular mechanical deection f.

Reference-contexts: However, the magnetic theory described above is not appropriate for ellipsoids or rectangles that have aspect ratios (length/width) of less than ~4 <ref> [18] </ref>. This is because the magnetization vector inside the magnetic material can rotate away from the easy axis and thus the material no longer acts like a permanent magnet. <p> When the magnetization switches, the mechanical structure abruptly changes directions so that it points in a new equilibrium direction. Because of this observed permanent-magnet behavior, a more complex soft-magnetic material analysis is not required for these geometries <ref> [18] </ref>. Fig. 10.
