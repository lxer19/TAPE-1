Reference-contexts: The robot had the task of clearing a square room (much like the environment used in this paper) by push 12 ing the boxes to the walls. Evolution found efficient, appealing, and often novel controllers for the robots <ref> [Balakrishnan & Honavar, 1996a] </ref>. We also used evolution to determine effective placements of the sensors and their ranges, while also evolving designs robust to sensor faults [Balakrishnan & Honavar, 1996b, Balakrishnan & Honavar, 1996c]. Consider a related, but more difficult problem. Suppose the robot only has a limited battery capacity.

Reference-contexts: For more details regarding these and other experiments, the reader is referred to <ref> [Balakrishnan & Honavar, 1997a] </ref>. 4 In the neuroscience community, the hippocampal formation and adjacent cortical regions of the medial temporal lobe have long been associated with spatial learning and memory, primarily through data that hippocampal lesions impair spatial learning skills in humans and animals [Churchland & Sejnowski, 1992, Cohen & Eichenbaum, <p> Drifts in the head-direction system can be corrected in a similar fashion by module 5. This allows dead-reckoning estimates to be constantly updated and corrected, thereby maintaining reliable and faithful estimates, as was our need. For more details, the reader is referred to <ref> [Balakrishnan & Honavar, 1997a] </ref>. 9 4 Implementation Details Our goal was to implement a computational model of the hippocampus that would allow the robot to perform spatial learning to maintain accurate dead-reckoning estimates. The relevant simulation details are as follows.

CS-TR97-01. Department of Computer Science, Iowa State University, Ames, USA. </institution>
Reference-contexts: With the spatial learning module built-in, evolution discovered high fitness designs with compact neurocontrollers and few sensors in key positions <ref> [Balakrishnan & Honavar, 1997b] </ref>. However, in this experiment, there were no errors either in sensing or in the robot's actions. In this paper we have proposed a model of spatial learning for robots that is capable of handling errors both in sensing as well as in actions.

Reference-contexts: There is some evidence from animal behavior studies that suggests that moving objects are not used for spatial localization <ref> [Bennett, 1993, Biegler & Morris, 1996] </ref>. On the other hand, if some objects happen to move after the robot has registered them in the spatial system, subsequent visits to that position would pose problems for the system implemented in this paper.

Reference-contexts: Many of the approaches use variants of a topological map to represent spatial information. A topological map is a directed graph of nodes and arcs, with the nodes representing distinctive places and the arcs representing the robot motions required to get from one distinctive place to the other <ref> [Brooks, 1985] </ref>. The primary advantage of such maps is their compact representation of space (as only distinctive places are represented and not the entire world), and their resistance to the accumulation of global movement errors (since the robots only navigate locally between places).

Contributions of Visual and Ideothetic Information to the Directional Firing. </title> <journal> Experimental Brain Research, </journal> <volume> 101, </volume> <pages> 24-34. 15 </pages>
Reference-contexts: Dead-reckoning is strongly suspected to be involved in the maintenance of place cell firing. 2. Head-direction cells have been found in several regions of the brain, including the dorsal pre-subiculum and the posterior parietal cortex <ref> [Taube et al., 1990a, Chen et al., 1994] </ref>. These cells appear to fire preferentially based on the current orientation of the animal's head, irrespective of its location in the environment. This endows the animal with a form of built-in compass.

As shown in Figure 1, the hip-pocampus receives highly processed sensory inputs from higher-order associational areas of the cerebral cortex, which converge primarily in the entorhinal cortex. <p> The hippocampal formation outputs to the subiculum, which in turn projects both to the pre- and para-subiculum and to the deep layers of the entorhinal cortex. For details regarding hippocampal function, the reader is referred to <ref> [Churchland & Sejnowski, 1992] </ref>. Apart from lesion data, cellular recordings of hippocampal cells have served to identify some crucial properties of signal processing in the hippocampus: 1.

Reference-contexts: As exact matches between the perceived and stored objects are unlikely, some form of approximate matching must be performed. Assuming normally distributed errors, Kalman filtering techniques can be used to correct odometric (or position estimation) errors based on perceptual inputs <ref> [Crowley, 1995] </ref>. Other such approaches include the fuzzy localization algorithm [Saffiotti & Wesley, 1995] and the use of a hill-climbing process to match evidence grids [Yamauchi & Beer, 1996]. On the other hand, animals demonstrate exceptional abilities for acquiring and responding to spatial information, including highly sophisticated spatial navigation behaviors.

Reference-contexts: Many variations of such topological maps exist depending on how distinctive places are represented: sonar signatures [Kuipers & Byun, 1991, Mataric, 1992], visual signatures <ref> [Engelson, 1994, Taylor & Kriegman, 1995] </ref>, combination of sonar and vision [Kortenkamp & Weymouth, 1994], dead-reckoning estimates [Yamauchi & Beer, 1996], etc.

Reference-contexts: There is considerable evidence that dead-reckoning is used by animals to maintain an estimate of their current position from some suitable origin of measurement [Gallistel, 1990, Mittelstaedt & Mittelstaedt, 1982]. However, without frequent calibrations based on visual inputs, such dead-reckoning systems rapidly accumulate errors <ref> [Etienne, 1992, Etienne et al., 1996] </ref>. 2.

Reference-contexts: Redish and Touretzky [1996] refer to the units of the latter kind as allocentric. In our view, allocentric units encode object positions in terms of their absolute position in a larger frame of reference, for instance, in a room. Such units have been found in primate hippocampus <ref> [Feigenbaum et al., 1987] </ref>, but are not used in our model at present. In any case, module 1 units respond to combinations of object attributes and their positions. Modules 2 and 3 both form associations of spatial features detected by module 1.

Reference-contexts: For instance, when rats were wrapped in a towel, restraining their motor activity entirely, almost all hippocampal neuronal activity ceased. Neuronal activity did not resume even when the rats were passively moved through the environment to regions that resulted in place cell firing earlier <ref> [Foster et al., 1989] </ref>. Similar results were also observed with head-direction cells [Knierim et al., 1995]. 4. Finally, without frequent visual recalibration, the firing of place cells and head-direction cells drift, accumulating considerable errors.

Reference-contexts: For instance, ants, bees, rodents, doves, etc., demonstrate a suprising sense of space, and are capable of navigating to their homes even after pseudo-random movements in search of food or their young <ref> [Gallistel, 1990] </ref>. <p> There is considerable evidence that dead-reckoning is used by animals to maintain an estimate of their current position from some suitable origin of measurement <ref> [Gallistel, 1990, Mittelstaedt & Mittelstaedt, 1982] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Not only must the physical design of the robot be developed, but also the control program that will make the robot perform the task in question. Both these issues are not easy to address in practice. Evolutionary algorithms <ref> [Goldberg, 1989] </ref> have proved to be versatile tools for efficiently searching the space of designs, and have been used to discover effective and novel control programs and useful physical robot designs (e.g. sensor placements, robot body plans, etc.).

Reference-contexts: Thus, without any metric information, the robot cannot take short-cuts to goals. 2 Other approaches to spatial map learning have used occupancy grids [Moravec & Elfes, 1985] or adaptive Kalman filtering techniques <ref> [Hebert et al., 1995] </ref> to allow the robot to incrementally build and maintain a representation of the environment. Importantly, these approaches provide effective ways of dealing with uncertainties in the information from the various low-precision sensors.

Reference-contexts: Thereafter, when released in the pool, they are able to compute a direct vector to the position of the submerged platform by subtracting the stored vectors to landmarks from the goal and the vectors to the same landmarks from the current position <ref> [Morris, 1981, Keith & McVety, 1988] </ref>. Experiments with gerbils have led Collett et al. [1986] to conclude that goal locations are remembered as an independent set of vectors to individual landmarks visible from the goal.

Finally, without frequent visual recalibration, the firing of place cells and head-direction cells drift, accumulating considerable errors. Based on some of this data, many models of the hippocampal formation and its purported role in spatial learning, have been proposed.

Reference-contexts: However, the exact nature of the code is still open to debate. The place fields appear to shift with manipulations of the environmental cues (or landmarks) suggesting that visual cues are used to initialize the place fields when the animal is reintroduced into 5 familiar environments <ref> [O'Keefe & Speakman, 1987, Muller et al., 1987] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Assuming normally distributed errors, Kalman filtering techniques can be used to correct odometric (or position estimation) errors based on perceptual inputs [Crowley, 1995]. Other such approaches include the fuzzy localization algorithm <ref> [Saffiotti & Wesley, 1995] </ref> and the use of a hill-climbing process to match evidence grids [Yamauchi & Beer, 1996]. On the other hand, animals demonstrate exceptional abilities for acquiring and responding to spatial information, including highly sophisticated spatial navigation behaviors.

Reference-contexts: Dead-reckoning is strongly suspected to be involved in the maintenance of place cell firing. 2. Head-direction cells have been found in several regions of the brain, including the dorsal pre-subiculum and the posterior parietal cortex <ref> [Taube et al., 1990a, Chen et al., 1994] </ref>. These cells appear to fire preferentially based on the current orientation of the animal's head, irrespective of its location in the environment. This endows the animal with a form of built-in compass.
