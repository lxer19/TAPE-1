Abstract: Real-time multimedia applications communicating over a packet-switched network present new challenges to the current networking technology. One of them is Quality of Service (QoS) requirement. Unlike some other network applications such as email and file transfer, which only require best-effort service at the network layer, multimedia applications such as video-on-demand and multimedia virtual presentation [1] demand more strict QoS. Most multimedia applications require an explicit delay bound on their transmitted packets because of delay-sensitivity. For example, the delay bound of a live video transmission is related to the receiver's latest playback time: if the packets arrive beyond that point, they may be useless for the receiver. The delay bound also varies from one application to another due to the differences in their delay-sensitivities and playback environment setups. While more and more multimedia applications such as vic [2], vat [3], nv [4], have been developed for a lossy packet-switched network environment such as that of the Internet, the packet loss tolerance of the application is also an important QoS issue: when network congestion happens, packets may be dropped due to an overflowing buffer or due to the effort of bounding the delay. Those dropped packets directly affect the viewing quality at the receiving end. Multimedia applications may have different packet loss tolerances due to the following two reasons: First, the applications may have different subjective quality requirements: a video conferencing session showing a person lecturing may tolerate more packet loss than a movie transmission session. Second, many schemes have been proposed to provide real-time network applications with better error recovery or protection over packet loss. Some of the approaches proposed for video transmissions include priority based protection and layered coding, structured packing, robust coding/decoding by introducing redundancy, and receiver recovery [5]. These schemes are different in their required conditions/equipments for deployment, their efficiency in fighting packet loss, and their bandwidth overhead and cost. A particular application may choose one or many of the above schemes to deal with packet loss. There is ongoing research to make some of these schemes more adaptive and conscious of the network environment and to improve their resilience to network packet loss [6, 7]. Because of the diversity of these schemes as well as the differences in the subjective quality requirement of each application, it is likely that the multimedia applications will present different packet loss requirements to the network. In summary, the network should expect the applications to present both delay bound and loss ratio requirement as essential components of the QoS the application would like to receive from the network. For real-time applications, there are two major types of QoS promises: guaranteed and predictive. To provide guaranteed service [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], worst-case analysis is normally used to calculate the needed resources and the calculated amount of resource is reserved over the lifetime of the application. For instance, the General Processing Sharing scheme [11] guarantees a specific amount of bandwidth to be available for use by a given flow. [11] proves that a worst-case packet delay can be achieved by this scheme if leaky bucket source control is used. [15] points out that the delay bound in [11] is usually very loose and the majority of the packets actually experience much smaller worst-case delay. Another problem with the guaranteed approach is that real-time multimedia traffic is usually bursty and unpredictable, hence the isolation of resources (a natural result of reservation) causes low network utilization [12, 16]. In [12], the long-term variability of the multimedia traffic

Even under this scheme, sources with high long-term traffic variability can only achieve around 25% network utilization <ref> [12] </ref>. The predictive services [17, 18, 19, 20, 21], on the other hand, trade a higher network utilization for a potential degradation of QoS. These schemes avoid the resource isolation by using either no resource reservation [17] or dynamic resource reservation [18, 19, 20, 21]. <p> different VBR sources or to different combinations of delay bound and loss ratio QoS requirements. 3.1 Efficiency study of OCP A 3.1.1 Comparison with deterministic schemes Here we compare the achieved bandwidth utilization of OCP A with that of the following two deterministic schemes: peak rate resource allocation and D-BIND <ref> [12] </ref>. The latter scheme provides guaranteed delay (with no packet loss) by pre-analyzing the VBR sources to model the traffic tightly. <p> In all simulations the sources have the same QoS tuple fD = 20ms; L = 0:0g, and the switch has 15Mbps link speed and infinite buffers. The achieved U T % for peak rate resource allocation algorithm and the D-BIND algorithm are obtained from <ref> [12] </ref>. <p> On the other hand, because OCP A is adaptive enough to respond to the traffic change, it performs well even for unpredictable traffic. Therefore OCP A presents higher U T % increase over static VirtualClock when applied to sources transmitting the advertisement clip. In <ref> [12] </ref>, these two traffic patterns are analyzed quantitatively and the authors point out that even with pre-analysis of the traffic, high bandwidth utilization is hard to achieve for non-repetitive style VBR traffic under static resource allocation. Their analysis focuses on achieving deterministic QoS. <p> Second, the admission of a new flow under parameter-based approach usually implies a resource reservation to support the requested QoS of the new flow. If applied on multimedia traffic|which is usually bursty| this isolation of resources could result in low network utilization. A very interesting study in <ref> [12] </ref> shows that the achieved network utilization largely depends on how tight the deterministic modeling of the source traffic is. When the source is "ill-behaved", a tight modeling is hard to achieve. Therefore in that case the utilization can only reach 20% 30%.

Experiments show that this approach supports higher utilization than the guaranteed approach does [21, 22]. However, in the predictive service presented in <ref> [17] </ref>, in case the delay bound of a packet is violated, the packet is still transmitted towards the receiver, even though the packet may be useless if received beyond the flow's latest playback point. <p> To our best knowledge, there is no existing scheme that considers diversities of both the delay and the packet loss tolerance. For example, the predictive service presented in <ref> [17] </ref> does not consider the loss ratio tolerance of an application. <p> Furthermore, <ref> [17] </ref> provides the delay control on a per-group basis by using priorities. We argue that providing QoS on a per-flow basis, instead of per-group, serves the applications better because the QoS control can reflect the differences of delay and loss tolerance of the applications. <p> For real-time multimedia applications, the parameter-based approach can be problematic. First, multimedia traffic has diversified traffic characteristics, and furthermore, these characteristics may be unknown in advance and unpredictable in the future. This makes traffic modeling extremely difficult. Since integrated services networks <ref> [17] </ref> encourage a diversity of applications, it is believed that tightly modeling the traffic is neither necessary nor plausible [33]. Second, the admission of a new flow under parameter-based approach usually implies a resource reservation to support the requested QoS of the new flow. <p> It is well-believed that most of the real-time applications have sufficient adaptiveness to survive occasional service deterioration, especially if the service deterioration is controlled to happen infrequently <ref> [17, 21, 22, 33] </ref>. Many multimedia applications should thus benefit from measurement-based admission control because of the high utilization it provides, its simplicity, and the diversity of its applicability. 12 5.2 Admission control for OCP A In [22], a measurement-based admission control algorithm is introduced to provide predicted delay bound.

As a result, the dynamics of OCP A provide sufficient resource sharing to enable high utilization. <p> It is well-believed that most of the real-time applications have sufficient adaptiveness to survive occasional service deterioration, especially if the service deterioration is controlled to happen infrequently <ref> [17, 21, 22, 33] </ref>. Many multimedia applications should thus benefit from measurement-based admission control because of the high utilization it provides, its simplicity, and the diversity of its applicability. 12 5.2 Admission control for OCP A In [22], a measurement-based admission control algorithm is introduced to provide predicted delay bound.

Reference-contexts: This concept allows the network to accommodate more real-time traffic than is possible with guaranteed services but at the cost of sacrificing strict QoS promises. Experiments show that this approach supports higher utilization than the guaranteed approach does <ref> [21, 22] </ref>. However, in the predictive service presented in [17], in case the delay bound of a packet is violated, the packet is still transmitted towards the receiver, even though the packet may be useless if received beyond the flow's latest playback point. <p> When the source is "ill-behaved", a tight modeling is hard to achieve. Therefore in that case the utilization can only reach 20% 30%. The measurement-based approach, when combined with conservative enough measurement methods, can provide decent network utilization as well as decent predictive service commitment <ref> [22] </ref>. It is well-believed that most of the real-time applications have sufficient adaptiveness to survive occasional service deterioration, especially if the service deterioration is controlled to happen infrequently [17, 21, 22, 33]. <p> It is well-believed that most of the real-time applications have sufficient adaptiveness to survive occasional service deterioration, especially if the service deterioration is controlled to happen infrequently <ref> [17, 21, 22, 33] </ref>.

In this algorithm, each source is modeled by a leaky bucket. <p> When evaluating the new flow's expected delay and the new flow's impact on existing flows' delay performance, the worst case parameters of the new flow's traffic are used. But for existing flows, the worst-case parameters are replaced by the measured quantities <ref> [22] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, in case the presented loss ratio bounds are exceeded, the deterioration of service must be controlled to be fair and graceful. In order to achieve high resource utilization, we designed a dynamic resource adjustment scheme used in combination with VirtualClock <ref> [23] </ref>. The original VirtualClock is a rate-based QoS control algorithm which schedules the flows sharing the resources according to their allocated fixed shares of the bandwidth. <p> The single flow OCP A QoS control algorithm can be easily extended to multiple flows sharing the resources with the assistance of a rate-based scheduling algorithm, such as VirtualClock <ref> [23] </ref>. VirtualClock schedules packets from different flows according to their VC (VirtualClock) values, which are calculated according to the allocated rates of the flows. VirtualClock guarantees each flow with its allocated service rate share.

Reference-contexts: Notice that the buffer decrement o can be adjusted based on the current B i so that the decrement is a small fraction of the original buffers. In OCP A, the occupancy thresholds OCP l and OCP u should be chosen carefully to prevent indefinite resource oscillation <ref> [24] </ref>. Meanwhile, to prevent frequent resource adjustment, a confidence period can be used for decreasing resources: the resources can only be decreased if the buffer occupancy is consistently lower than OCP l for a certain period of confidence time. <p> Simulations have been conducted on various sources to study the effects of different values of confidence time <ref> [24] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Under OCP A, despite the differences in the QoS requirements, in the beginning of the transmission each source is simply allocated approximately the resources comparable to their average rates. Under the static scheme, we use Bruneel's approximation <ref> [28] </ref> to calculate the desired amount of resources needed for the specific QoS requirement; and then distribute the amount of resources among all the flows according to the weights of the calculated desired amounts. Figure 12 plotted the final achieved loss ratio for each flow.

Reference-contexts: control in two aspects: first, the admission control in general for predictive services; second, the admission control that is suitable for the algorithm we presented in the previous sections. 5.1 Admission control for predictive services in general Generally, there are two basic approaches to admission control | parameter-based and measurement-based <ref> [32] </ref>. The parameter-based approach is usually based on a priori traffic characteristics; therefore, the admission decision can be achieved by formal analysis. <p> On the other hand, the measurement-based approach relies on the measurement of actual traffic load and performance in making admission decisions <ref> [32] </ref>. Because the network situation is dynamic, this approach can never support guaranteed service. For real-time multimedia applications, the parameter-based approach can be problematic. First, multimedia traffic has diversified traffic characteristics, and furthermore, these characteristics may be unknown in advance and unpredictable in the future.

Reference-contexts: This makes traffic modeling extremely difficult. Since integrated services networks [17] encourage a diversity of applications, it is believed that tightly modeling the traffic is neither necessary nor plausible <ref> [33] </ref>. Second, the admission of a new flow under parameter-based approach usually implies a resource reservation to support the requested QoS of the new flow. If applied on multimedia traffic|which is usually bursty| this isolation of resources could result in low network utilization. <p> It is well-believed that most of the real-time applications have sufficient adaptiveness to survive occasional service deterioration, especially if the service deterioration is controlled to happen infrequently <ref> [17, 21, 22, 33] </ref>. Many multimedia applications should thus benefit from measurement-based admission control because of the high utilization it provides, its simplicity, and the diversity of its applicability. 12 5.2 Admission control for OCP A In [22], a measurement-based admission control algorithm is introduced to provide predicted delay bound.
