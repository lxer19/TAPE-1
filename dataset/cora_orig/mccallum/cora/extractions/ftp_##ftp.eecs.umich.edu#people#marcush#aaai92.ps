Abstract: An agent operating in the real world must be able to coordinate its activities with those of other agents. Traditionally, work in multiagent coordination has assumed that agents can communicate about their intentions or that they are coordinated through the efforts of a third party. In many environments, however, reliance on communication or on a coordinating agent is infeasible due to the unpredictable nature of the environment or to negative side-effects of communication. We have developed a multiple-resolution hierarchical scheme by which an agent can use observations to infer the high-level goals of other agents. The research domain to which we have applied our scheme is coordinated motion and navigation among multiple robots, both in simulation and in the real-world. Our hierarchical scheme makes probabilistic plan recognition possible in this domain, and it helps to further identify and begin solving crucial issues in plan recognition in physical domains.

Reference-contexts: As in any plan recognition system, the goal is to infer the high-level plans of another agent based upon observations of the other agent's behaviors. While a predominant portion of plan recognition research has been in the context of such domains as discourse analysis and story understanding (e.g. <ref> [Charniak and Goldman1990, Lochbaum et al.1990] </ref>), very little research has gone into applying the paradigm to autonomous robots in real-world situations.

Reference-contexts: We have implemented a plan recognition system for multiple autonomous robots in a simulator and in the real world to get a better understanding of the important issues that face coordination through observation among autonomous robotic systems. The simulated system operates within a MICE <ref> [Montgomery and Durfee1990] </ref> controlled environment, where agents move to and fro in a two dimensional grid world. Sensors are simulated, noiseless, and precise. The implemented real-world system involves the operation of multiple mobile robots performing tasks in an enclosed area of the robotics laboratory at the University of Michigan.

Reference-contexts: Location Destination Move Z Z Plan Recognition Belief Net Architecture In order to perform the necessary accumulation of information and subsequent inferencing, we incorporated a belief network (also called a Bayesian network) <ref> [Pearl1988] </ref> into the system. This network permits the insertion and accumulation of sensor-based observations that get propagated throughout the network, resulting in the ability to hypothesize goals. The over-watching robot periodically senses the watched robot to determine the visible primitive actions (if any) that were performed by the observed robot.

Reference-contexts: In both environments, the overwatching robot, having inferred possible final destinations, tries to move to a location that complements the most likely final destination (this could be the same location, an adjacent location, etc.) The system's inferencing is done using a belief network implemented with the IDEAL system <ref> [Srinivas and Breese1989] </ref>. Evidence in the form of visually perceived actions is input into the network and then propagated through it. The high-level plans/goals of the watched agent can then be hypothesized from the results. These high-level goals are possible destination locations within the workspace.
