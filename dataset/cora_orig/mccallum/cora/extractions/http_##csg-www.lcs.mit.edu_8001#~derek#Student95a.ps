Title: Using GCC as an Efficient, Portable Back-End  
Author: Derek Chiou 
Abstract: In order to generate efficient object code for modern microprocessors, aggressive compilers customize their code generators (the back-end of the compiler) for each target processor. Customized back-ends, however, are major undertakings that most experimental compilers writers cannot afford. We describe a method to easily generate efficient object code for virtually any UNIX platform. The method relies on Gnu's GCC compiler and its extensions to the C language. These techniques have been applied to pHluid[1], a pH/Id compiler. The techniques, their application to pHluid and some performance results are reported in this paper.

Reference-contexts: Of course, if more registers are needed, C function calls can be surrounded by save/restore register code. Such code can be ported with absolutely no effort other than selecting the correct registers to use on a particular architecture. 3 Applying the Techniques to pHluid pHluid <ref> [1] </ref> is an Id [2]/pH [3] compiler written in the Scheme2C dialect of Scheme and C. Id and pH are parallel multi- threaded functional languages.

The compiler is meant to be extremely portable and a complete implementation of both languages and has not been optimized or even well partitioned (the process of creating threads).
