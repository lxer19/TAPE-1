Title: Experiments in Query Categorization systematically? Can queries be categorized for expected stylistic preferences solely from

Abstract: Previous experiments have shown that it is possible to find rules that pick out non-relevant documents from sets of ranked documents. The success rate for such rules varies across queries, much as can be expected: queries are different (Karlgren and Straszheim, 1996). Most queries are either unaffected or slightly improved. A few are disasters, percentage-wise. A disaster is a case of wrongly reranking four or five documents: the margins are slim. Especially if a highly ranked document is demoted to the end of the list the average precision falls noticeably. In the case of the two example rules ("rule 4" and "rule 876") from the previous section which both get disastrous results on query 272, rule 876 mistakenly demotes three relevant documents, where one of them was ranked number one, and rule 4 demotes two. In all, rule 4 improves scores of ten queries and lowers scores of four with a combined average precision of 99.9% of the baseline; rule 876 improves ten and lowers two queries with an average of 99.4%. We cluster the training queries by a variety of different methods. fl This paper is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant IRI-93-02615 and by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under contract 94-F157900-000 from the Office of Research and Development.
