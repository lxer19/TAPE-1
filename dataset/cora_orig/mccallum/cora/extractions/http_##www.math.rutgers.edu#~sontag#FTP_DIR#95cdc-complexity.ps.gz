Reference-contexts: First of all, one may play "logic tricks" with the statement and make the problem too difficult simply by making too abstract the precise meaning of the words "given a system and a state" and allowing an arbitrary recursive-function specification (see for instance the proposed solution in <ref> [1] </ref> to Arnold's famous open question regarding the analogous problem of asymptotic stability). <p> One such class, which appears in often in many different contexts ranging from actuator saturation to the study of hybrid systems, is given by systems of the following form: x (t + 1) = sat (Ax (t) + Bu (t)) (2) where the state space X = <ref> [1; 1] </ref> n , for some positive integer n, the controls u (t) take values in a space R m , the matrices A and B have sizes n fin and n fim respectively, and sat (z), for a vector z, is the clipped linearity or saturation of each component, that <p> z, is the clipped linearity or saturation of each component, that is, the ith component of sat (z) is z i , the ith component of z, if jz i j &lt; 1, and equals the sign of z i otherwise. (One could take X = R n instead of <ref> [1; 1] </ref> n , but nothing essential would change, since after one step all state coordinates have magnitude at most one anyway because of the saturation.) See the recent book [3] for an exposition of many control-theoretic questions for systems of the form (2); see also [16].

Reference-contexts: The proof in [13] used systems with at least two control channels and with unbounded controls. Sub- sequently, the result was improved so as to show that the problem is hard even for single-input (and bounded control) systems by Kawski in <ref> [4] </ref>. 5. Analog Computation Finally, I wish to make some comments on the issue of analog computation. The complexity and undecidability results surveyed above are all stated in terms of classical models of computation, that is, Turing machine (serial and digital computing) models.

Piecewise-Linear Systems The paper <ref> [10] </ref> proposed the study of general discrete- time interconnections of linear systems and automata, a type of "hybrid" systems that would integrate linear systems theory and some areas of computer science. <p> On the other hand, finite-horizon problems are in principle decidable, as shown in <ref> [11, 10] </ref>. Thus it is of interest to try to study the computational complexity of such problems. Unfortunately, there is a rather negative result in that regard. To explain this result, given in [12], it is necessary to review some basic terminology from logic.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, the idea in that paper was to propose a logic-based approach based on the "language" of "piece <p>- wise linear algebra" developed in <ref> [11] </ref>, in such a manner that finite-horizon analysis and design problems can be translated into decision problems for the corresponding language, and more precisely solved by means of quantifier elimination procedures. <p> On the other hand, finite-horizon problems are in principle decidable, as shown in <ref> [11, 10] </ref>. Thus it is of interest to try to study the computational complexity of such problems. Unfortunately, there is a rather negative result in that regard. To explain this result, given in [12], it is necessary to review some basic terminology from logic.

Unfortunately, there is a rather negative result in that regard. To explain this result, given in <ref> [12] </ref>, it is necessary to review some basic terminology from logic. I'll try to do so in very intuitive terms. <p> Thus, not only should P be different from NP, but problems whose definition requires 89 should be much harder to solve than those in NP, and so forth going "up" along the hierarchy. The result in <ref> [12] </ref> was that problems in any given level, such as for instance 989, for piecewise linear systems are of the exact same complexity as problems in the corresponding level of the polynomial hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: The literature regarding this ques tion is very large; see for instance [18] and the references there. No complete characterization is yet available, however. In <ref> [13] </ref>, a result was presented which shows that the problem is intrinsically hard from a computa <p>- tional point of view. It is shown that the controllability problem is NP-hard for a class of systems, bilinear systems, for which the accessibility property can be checked in polynomial time. <p> In this sense, accessibility, which for linear systems is equivalent to controllability, is no more complex to check, in a precise quantifiable sense, for nonlinear systems. On the other hand, controllability is harder, also in a precise mathematical measure of difficulty. To summarize some of the results in <ref> [13] </ref> and [14] (this latter reference contains some results which were not in the journal paper), consider the class of "polynomial" systems (5), defined as follows. <p> To state a somewhat more interesting result, take next the subclass of bilinear subsystems, that is, polynomial systems with equations describable as _x = A + i=1 ! in terms of rational matrices of appropriate sizes, as before evolving on an algebraic submanifold X. In <ref> [13] </ref> the following result is shown: Theorem. For the class of bilinear subsystems, accessibility can be decided in polynomial time but controllability is NP-hard. The proof in [13] used systems with at least two control channels and with unbounded controls. <p> In <ref> [13] </ref> the following result is shown: Theorem.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, controllability is harder, also in a precise mathematical measure of difficulty. To summarize some of the results in [13] and <ref> [14] </ref> (this latter reference contains some results which were not in the journal paper), consider the class of "polynomial" systems (5), defined as follows. <p> Let R (x) be the set of states reachable from x. The system is accessible if the interior of the set R (x) is nonempty, for each x 2 X. It is controllable if R (x) = X for all x. We remarked in <ref> [14] </ref>: Proposition. Accessibility is decidable for the class of polynomial systems. Of course, this begs the question of more accurately characterizing the computational complexity of the problem. <p> This helps in bounding the complexity, but the precise characterization seems to be still unknown. The following conjeture was in <ref> [14] </ref>, and, as far as I am aware, is still open: Conjecture. Controllability is undecidable for the class of polynomial systems, but the class of all controllable polynomial systems is recursively enumerable.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, ~ is null-controllable for (3) if and only if the null-controllability property is verified with k = n (this is a standard elementary fact; see for instance Lemma 3.2.8 in <ref> [15] </ref>); thus a state ~ is null-controllable if and only if A n ~ is in the the reach- ability space of (3), that is, the span of the columns of B; AB; : : : ; A n1 B.
