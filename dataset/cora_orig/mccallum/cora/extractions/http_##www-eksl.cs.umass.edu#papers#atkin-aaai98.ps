Abstract: We present two systems for simulating and designing agents, respectively. The first, the Abstract Force Simulator (AFS), is a domain-general simulator of agents applying forces; many domains can be characterized in this way. The second, Hierarchical Agent Control (HAC), is a general toolkit for designing an action hierarchy. It supports action abstraction, a multilevel computational architecture, sensor integration, and planning. It is particularly well suited to controlling large numbers of agents in dynamic environments. Together, AFS and HAC provide a very general framework for designing and testing agents.

Reference-contexts: This process is made efficient by estimating the time at which something interesting will happen in the simulation, and advancing the simulation directly to these critical points. This type of planning, which uses stored solutions (plans) that are not fully elaborated, is known as partial hierarchical planning <ref> (Georgeff & Lansky 1986) </ref>. Due to the flexibility within the plans, it is particularly well suited to dealing with dynamic environments. In addition, the fact that we have pre-compiled solutions for certain types of problems cuts down enormously on the amount of search we would otherwise have to do.

Reference-contexts: Physical processes, military engagements, and games such as billiards are all about agents moving and applying force to one another (see, for example, (Tzu 1988) and <ref> (Karr 1981) </ref>). Even the somewhat abstract realm of diplomacy can viewed in these terms: One government might try to apply pressure to another for some purpose, or intend to contain a crisis before it spreads.

Reference-contexts: In most cases, an action's realize method will be called many times before the action terminates. We will see an example of this later. The Action Hierarchy HAC is a supervenient architecture <ref> (Spector & Hendler 1994) </ref>. This means that it abides by the principle that higher levels should provide goals and context for the lower levels, and lower levels provide sensory reports and messages to the higher levels ("goals down, knowledge up").
