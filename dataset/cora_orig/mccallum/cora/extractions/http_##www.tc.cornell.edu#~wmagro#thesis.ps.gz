Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo techniques, in their various incarnations, calculate ground state or finite temperature properties of many-body quantum systems. We apply the path-integral Monte Carlo method to hydrogen at densities and temperatures in the regime of cooperative thermal and pressure dissociation, relevant to structural models of the giant planets' interiors. We treat the protons and electrons as quantum particles, thereby avoiding the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Fermi-Dirac exchange statistics are treated within the fixed-node approximation, with the nodes specified by the free Fermi gas. In the region of molecular dissociation, we observe properties consistent with and suggestive of a first order phase transition with positive density discontinuity (n H 2 &lt; n H+H ). In a separate study, we apply the variational and diffusion Monte Carlo techniques to study the ground state properties of two distinct, but related, two-dimensional systems: the Bose Yukawa liquid and the Bose Coulomb liquid. The Yukawa system is a model for flux line interactions in high temperature superconductors. We determine the phase diagram as a function of mass and density and find a high density scaling relation describing the crossover to Coulomb behavior. We apply our results to a sample superconducting compound, Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 . Next the results on the Coulomb system are presented. We show that the predominance of long wavelength plasmons destroys Bose condensation in this system. The ground state of this system is closely related to the bosonic representation of Laughlin's wave function for the fractional quantum Hall system.

A more detailed description of Monte Carlo methods may be found in a text by Kalos and Whitlock <ref> [1] </ref>. When possible, we follow their notation and presentation. 2.1.1 Random Variables and Their Properties Before discussing Monte Carlo estimation of integrals, we must introduce the concept of random variables. Imagine a series of experiments, in each of which the initial state of the system under study is identical.

Reference-contexts: In other words, the probability of obtaining an estimate for hgi with a given error decreases as the number of samples increases. The Central Limit Theorem <ref> [2] </ref> makes a stronger statement: if the variance of g (x) exists, then for sufficiently large N the G N are normally distributed with mean hgi and variance proportional to 1=N . 2.3 Sampling Random Variables To use a Monte Carlo estimator, we need a source for variates drawn from f

Reference-contexts: The development and analysis of such algorithms are best left to mathematicians, but we summarize the usual approach here. Most (pseudo-)random number generators, as they are called, are of a type known as linear congruential <ref> [3] </ref>, in which the random number stream is defined by the recurrence relation, x i+1 = (x i + b) mod P: (2.17) The integers f; b; P g define the generator.

Reference-contexts: Because a multi-dimensional normal distribution can be written as a product of one-dimensional Gaussians, an algorithm to generate simple Gaussian variables is sufficient. An efficient method for generating Gaussian random numbers, the so-called Box-Muller method <ref> [4] </ref>, in fact generates two Gaussian variates. The essence of the method lies in the observation that a two-dimensional Gaussian, when written in polar coordinates, is separable and invertible.

Reference-contexts: A set of rules governing the acceptance or rejection is constructed to exactly sample an arbitrary distribution. In 1953, Metropolis et al. introduced a significant new rejection technique <ref> [5] </ref>. The Metropolis algorithm defines a Markov process, an ergodic and non-periodic random walk through the phase space of variates, in which the limiting distribution of points visited coincides with the distribution of interest. Ergodicity implies a finite probability to reach each point in a finite number of steps.

Reference-contexts: In the largest celestial objects, hydrogen is a fully ionized plasma at almost all radii. In contrast, it exists as a molecular gas deep in the Jovian planets (and cooler stars such as brown dwarves) <ref> [6] </ref>. Dissociation and ionization eventually occur near the planetary core. Helium is the next most abundant element in the giant planets [7, 8], so an understanding of hydrogen rich H-He mixtures is ultimately needed for precise structural modeling. <p> Jupiter has a rocky core, which accounts for 10% of its mass. At the surface of the core, hydrogen is metallic and exists at T = 20 000 ffi K, n = 4:5 g=cm 3 [11], P 40 Mbar <ref> [6] </ref>. Hydrogen is better understood in its metallic state than in its molecular phase. Under these conditions the electron gas is nearly degenerate, so the primary contributions to the energy are the energy of a zero-temperature free Fermi gas and its interaction energy with the protons. <p> The density discontinuity associated with a first order transition would sharply alter the density profiles of the giant planets <ref> [11, 6] </ref>. Recently, Chabrier et al. have shown that only in the presence of such transition, often called the plasma phase transition (PPT), are the most sophisticated structural models of Saturn consistent with gravitational moment data [44].

Reference-contexts: Modeled as a gray-body, Jupiter emits more energy than it absorbs, implying an energy source exists deep in the planet. The observed luminosity exceeds conductive and radiative transport capacities for metallic hydrogen by an order of magnitude, so the heat flow is thought to be convective <ref> [9] </ref>. Only a small temperature gradient is required to sustain the observed flow, however, so a state of local equilibrium is thought to exist throughout the planets [10]. <p> The nature of the transformation is not simple to deduce, since it occurs in a regime where both thermal and pressure effects are important, and has been the source of considerable controversy <ref> [41, 42, 9, 43, 39, 40] </ref>. The main theoretical issue is whether it is continuous or not, since there is no difference in symmetry. Further, it is not immediately obvious whether the ionization process will proceed directly to the metallic phase or instead include an intermediate atomic phase.

Reference-contexts: The primary difficulty in reaching the relevant kilobar to megabar region lies in keeping the hydrogen sample sufficiently cool.

At higher densities, Ichimaru and coworkers <ref> [32, 33] </ref> have successfully applied the hypernetted-chain and modified convolution approximation equations to to the hot, dense plasma (log 10 P 7, log 10 T &gt; 5). Hydrogen, however, does not reach these temperatures in the Jovian planets.

Reference-contexts: Hydrogen, however, does not reach these temperatures in the Jovian planets. Using quantum Monte Carlo techniques, Pierleoni et al. have also studied this regime, improving the Ichimaru results and extending them to lower temperatures (log 10 T &gt; 4) <ref> [34] </ref>. From Fig. 3.1, the Jovian adiabats cross the dissociation transformation of molecular hydrogen in the planetary interior. <p> Thermal energies are comparable to the Fermi energy in our calculations, so we expect significant degeneracy effects, characterized by the degeneracy parameter, kT =E F . Using fixed-node PIMC, Pierleoni et al. found the hydrogen plasma is well described by Debye-Huckel theory for temperatures &gt; 4 <ref> [34] </ref>. Conditions in our simulations, which range from 0:025 to 1:0, are considerably more degenerate, so Debye-Huckel will not apply. The thermal de Broglie wavelength of the particles is a useful indicator of the importance of quantum effects in the system.

At r s = 1:75, the pressure also increases at the transition, but the relevant calculations, at 5000 ffi K and 6 250 ffi K, are not reliable, due to insufficient sampling.

In the bisection algorithm, the path is sampled in several stages, with each stage called a level.

Reference-contexts: For a system of two particles interacting with a short-range potential, the squaring property (3.10) can be exploited to develop an exact method for computing the density matrix <ref> [48] </ref>. Because the Coulomb interaction is long-ranged, we rewrite it as v (r) = v s (r) + v l (r), where s and l indicate short- and long-range terms, respectively. We first treat the short-range interaction, then re-introduce the long-range term in a controlled approximation.

Reference-contexts: The proof is based on two points: (i) the exact density matrix vanishes at its own nodes (by definition) and (ii) the Bloch equation, with these initial and boundary conditions, has a unique non-trivial solution <ref> [52] </ref>. This fixed-node solution, then, must be the exact fermion density matrix. A simple way to enforce the zero boundary condition is to add an infinite external potential outside the nodal cell [53]. <p> That this is possible relies on two facts. First, nodal regions of the exact fermion density matrix have a simple tiling property, which results from the exchange symmetries of the density matrix <ref> [52] </ref>. Each nodal region maps into each other through some permutation, P , so the entire space may be `tiled' by applying the N ! possible permutations to the points inside a single nodal region.

Consequently, we do not use ground-state trial nodes. 3.6.6 Dual Reference Points We expect the free-particle density matrix to have reasonable nodes for small imaginary times, that is, for configurations close to the reference point, because the kinetic energy dominates the influence of the interaction at high temperatures. <p> Conversely, we expect the greatest error in the nodes to occur at low temperature, where correlations are large.

Reference-contexts: A temperature-independent bond length of 0:67 Amay be estimated from the correlation functions at r s = 2:2 (Fig. 4.8), about 10% below the zero pressure value of 0:742 A <ref> [66] </ref>. As the density is increased, the bond further contracts to 0:65 A at r s = 1:86. At (T = 5000 ffi K; r s = 1:75), the molecular phase is not fully developed, so the bond length cannot be accurately determined.

Reference-contexts: This behavior, as observed in SC92, is shown in the V -T diagram, Fig. 4.13. Consistency with the negatively sloped coexistence line requires the density to increase when the system is cooled isobarically. This follows from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation <ref> [67] </ref>. The magnitude of the discontinuity decreases with increasing molar volume, until a critical point is reached (at n = 0:35 g=cm 3 , T = 15 310 ffi K in SC92).

Reference-contexts: The situation changed when Nelson and Seung published a model for flux line interactions in high-temperature superconduc-tors which directly maps the three spatial dimensions of the flux line system onto a 2+1 (imaginary time) dimensional system of interacting bosons <ref> [69] </ref>. The particle interactions in this model are screened Coulomb, or Yukawa, repulsions. In two dimensions, this potential is a modified-Bessel-function, *K 0 (r=). In our study, we first calculate the properties and phase diagram of the general Yukawa system. <p> This system is of particular interest for its application to high-T c materials: Nelson et al. have proposed a model for flux lattice melting in strongly type-II materials, in which the flux lines are mapped onto a 2D system of bosons interacting via K 0 (r) <ref> [69] </ref>. This system is well-suited for study with ground state quantum Monte Carlo techniques. The short range of the potential implies that relatively small systems can be studied, without truncating interactions. Although the individual calculations are not computationally demanding, the size of the phase space is quite large. <p> While this is lower than typical values in 3D systems, it is consistent with values observed for other 2D systems, including the 2D charged Bose gas and 2D 4 He, which melt near fl = 0:254 [80, 81]. 6.5 Applications to Flux Lattice Melting Nelson et al. <ref> [69] </ref> have shown that the statistical mechanics of the flux-line lattice (FLL) of high-T c superconductors can be studied through an appropriate mapping onto the 2D Yukawa boson system.

The liquid phase has c = 0, and 88 the identical particles are free to traverse the simulation cell. The Jastrow function contains parameters which, along with c, are varied to minimize E V . 1 A cusp in the wave function occurs when two bosons overlap. <p> First, the Jastrow wave function better models the solid phase than the liquid, a feature common to many systems. This is apparent from the comparatively large values of (E VMC E) for the liquid shown in Tables 6.8-6.13. Second, as in the 3D Yukawa system <ref> [71] </ref>, the energy difference between the phases is very small, even far from the transition. Consequently, the VMC estimate of fl fl x is always too large.

Because this wave function is typically better than the liquid wave function <ref> [101, 71] </ref>, a variational study would be ill-suited to comparing liquid and solid energies.

Reference-contexts: Although not symmetric under particle exchange, this type of wave function gives excellent energies for many simple solids since exchange energies in quantum crystals are small. Because this wave function is typically better than the liquid wave function <ref> [101, 71] </ref>, a variational study would be ill-suited to comparing liquid and solid energies. Use of DMC is hence important to eliminate 117 Table 7.1: Ground state energies per particle for systems of 16 to 154 particles, calculated with DMC.

Reference-contexts: Although, in the thermodynamic limit, the ground state of this system is not condensed, superfluidity is nonetheless possible. We note that, because the plasmons are massive, this system has a finite critical superfluid velocity, in the sense of Landau <ref> [102] </ref>. Path integral calculations at finite temperature, or imaginary time diffusion constant studies in DMC, for example, could determine the superfluid density of this system.
