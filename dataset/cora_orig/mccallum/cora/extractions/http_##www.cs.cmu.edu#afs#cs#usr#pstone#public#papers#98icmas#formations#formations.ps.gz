Abstract: Multiagent domains consisting of teams of agents that need to collaborate in an adversarial environment offer challenging research opportunities. In this paper, we introduce periodic team synchronization domains, as time-critical environments in which agents act autonomously with low communication, but they can periodically synchronize in a full-communication setting. We present a team agent structure that allows for an agent to capture and reason about team agreements. We achieve collaboration between agents through the introduction of formations. A formation decomposes the task space defining a set of roles. Homogeneous agents can flexibly switch roles within formations, and agents can change formations dynamically, according to pre-defined triggers to be evaluated at run-time. This flexibility increases the performance of the overall team. Our team structure further includes pre-planning for frequent situations. We fully implemented this approach in the domain of robotic soccer. Our simulator team made it to the semi-finals of the RoboCup-97 competition, in which 29 teams participated. It achieved a total score of 67-9 over six different games, and successfully demonstrated its flexible team structure.

Reference-contexts: We call these pre-determined protocols locker-room agreements. Formed during the periodic synchronization opportunities, locker-room agreements are remembered identically by all agents and allow them to coordinate efficiently. In the context of <ref> [2] </ref>, locker-room agreements can be viewed as C-commitments, or commitments by team members to do the appropriate thing at the right time, as opposed to S-commitments with which agents adopt each other's goals. In this paper, we introduce an agent architecture suited for team agents in PTS domains.

Reference-contexts: Most proposed teamwork structures (e.g. joint intentions, shared plans) rely on agents in a multiagent system to negotiate and/or contract with each other in order to initiate team plans <ref> [3, 5] </ref>. However, in dynamic, real-time domains with unreliable communication, complex negotiation protocols may take too much time and/or be infeasible due to communication restrictions. ? This research is sponsored in part by the DARPA/RL Knowledge Based Planning and Scheduling Initiative under grant number F30602-95-1-0018. <p> This view of teams is complementary to teams that form on the fly for a specific action and keep communicating throughout the execution of that action as in <ref> [3] </ref>. Instead, in PTS domains, teams define coordination protocols during the synchronization opportunity and then disperse into the environment, acting autonomously with little or no communication possible. It has been claimed that pre-determined team actions are not flexible or robust to failure [19].

Reference-contexts: In both simulated and robotic systems, teams can plan strategies before the game, at halftime, or at other breakpoints, but during the course of the game, communication is limited. There are several other examples of PTS domains, such as hospital/factory maintenance <ref> [4] </ref>, multi-spacecraft missions [15], search and rescue, and battlefield combat [19]. 2 Team Member Architecture Our new teamwork structure is situated within a team member architecture suitable for PTS domains in which individual agents can capture locker-room agreements and respond to the environment, while acting autonomously.

Reference-contexts: Two ways in which agents can use the position flexibility is to react to the ball's position and to mark opponents. When reacting to the ball's position, the 3 Soccer formations are typically described as goalie-defenders-midfielders-forwards <ref> [8] </ref>. They are not to be confused with military-type formations in which agents must stay in precise relative positions. agent moves to a location within its range that minimizes its distance to the ball.

Reference-contexts: In both cases, a behavior is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of arbitrary depth. The leaves of the DAGs are the behavior types' respective outputs: internal state changes for internal behaviors and action primitives for external behaviors. Our notion of behavior is consistent with that laid out in <ref> [9] </ref>. In particular, behaviors can be nested at different levels: selection among lower-level behaviors can be considered a higher-level behavior, with the overall agent behavior considered a single "do-the-task" behavior.

Reference-contexts: This strategy, along with the flexible teamwork structure as a whole, helped us to perform well in the tournament, making it to the semi-finals in a field of 29 teams and out-scoring opponents by a total score of 67-9 <ref> [12] </ref>. We also used this flexible teamwork structure on our real robot team which won the RoboCup small-size robot competition. Although developed in simulation, all of the teamwork concepts apply directly to real robot teams as well.

Reference-contexts: The formation and each of the units can also specify inter-position behavior specifications for the member positions, as illustrated in Figure 5 (a). In this case, the formations specify inter-role interactions, namely the positions to which a player should consider passing the ball <ref> [18] </ref>. Figure 5 (b) illustrate the units, the roles involved, and their captains. Here, the units contain defenders, midfielders, forwards, left players, center players, and right players.
