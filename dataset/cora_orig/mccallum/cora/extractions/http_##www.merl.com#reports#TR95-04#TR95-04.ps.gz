Abstract: In this paper, we propose the use of a voxel-based data representation not only for visualization, but also for modeling objects and structures derived from volumetric data. The paper describes work in progress towards demonstrating the utility of a voxel-based format for modeling physical interactions between virtual objects. Data structures are presented that help to optimize storage requirements and preserve object integrity during object movement. An adaptation to volume rendering algorithms is discussed that enables objects to be rendered individually and then combined in a final compositing step. Finally, algorithms and prototype systems are presented that use a voxel-based format to model physical interactions between objects. These physical interactions include collision detection and avoidance of object interpenetration, haptic, or tactile, exploration of virtual objects using a force feedback device, and object deformation.

Reference-contexts: They have demonstrated that many of the graphical effects, such as shading and reflectance, that are available in surface-based graphics representation are also possible using volume graphics [KAUF88], <ref> [AVILA92] </ref>, [YAGEL92]. Assuming that memory needs and processing requirements can be met effectively, Kaufman et al assert that volume graphics has the potential to supersede surface-based graphics just as 2D raster graphics superseded vector graphics. Whether or not this potential is realized will depend on many factors.

Reference-contexts: Such models have been used for implant design in orthopedics, for planning a surgical approach, for training and education, and for predicting the outcome of a planned surgery (for example, see papers in <ref> [DIGIO94] </ref> and [ROBB94]). Unfortunately, surface-based models created from the 3D image data discard interior structure and are prone to estimation errors, especially where details in the surface (such as small fractures in a bone surface) are small relative to the resolution of the data set.

Reference-contexts: Although processing needs and large memory requirements are still major hurdles that need to be overcome, faster algorithms and special-purpose hardware are enabling real-time volume rendering of data of significant size and resolution [NEUM93B][CABRAL94]. Recently, Kaufman et al <ref> [KAUF93] </ref> have introduced the field of volume graphics, where a voxel-based data format is used to represent graphical objects that are customarily represented by surface-based models.

Reference-contexts: More recent sources of volumetric data include industrial CT, finite-element analysis techniques, and "voxelization" methods used to convert CAD and CSG models into voxel-based data representations that can be visualized with voxel-based rendering methods <ref> [KAUF87] </ref>. Early methods to visualize volumetric data used surface rendering techniques to display polygon-based surface models derived from the volumetric data. Since the late 1970's, volume rendering techniques have been developed which enable more direct visualization of the volumetric data.

Reference-contexts: With appropriate preprocessing, volume rendering can be used to visualize surfaces, interior structure, and objects that do not have well defined surfaces. Many effective volume editing tools, volume rendering algorithms and data compression schemes have been developed (see for example <ref> [KAUF90A] </ref>). Although processing needs and large memory requirements are still major hurdles that need to be overcome, faster algorithms and special-purpose hardware are enabling real-time volume rendering of data of significant size and resolution [NEUM93B][CABRAL94].
