Abstract: We introduce a modification of existing algorithms that allows easier analysis of numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations. We relax the requirement that the specified problem be solved, and instead solve a "nearby" problem exactly, in Wilkinson's tradition of backward error analysis. The precise meaning of "nearby" is left to the user. This inexpensive algorithm sublimates the well-known difficulties associated with the propagation of accumulated error and avoids the difficulty of exponential growth of inclusion widths associated with interval techniques. No claim is made for the accuracy with which the specified problem is solved. It is shown that often no such claim is necessary.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, a small defect is achievable and gives much insight into the physical problem being modeled. Chaotic systems give rise to unstable initial value problems, by definition. On the other hand, achievement of a small global error over long time integration is computationally intractable (see <ref> [Adam90] </ref>, for example). Achievement of a small defect is both possible and useful for such systems [Corl91a]. The defect-controlled approach sidesteps the bothersome question of computational chaos. 3 Defect-Controlled Algorithm An outline of the defect-controlled algorithm is given in Listing 1.

Reference-contexts: The defect control functions as a part of the step-size selection strategy. In our implementation, interval computations are restricted to computing an enclosure of jjffi (t)jj. We use interval Taylor operators implemented in Ada <ref> [Corl91c] </ref>. These operators achieve tight bounds on the range of the defect and its derivatives by using natural interval extensions, mono-tonicity, concavity, mean value forms, centered forms, and Taylor forms.

Reference-contexts: 1 Problem Addressed The idea of guaranteed defect control is applicable to large classes of operator equations. The concept of "defect," or "residual," was used by Kruckeberg <ref> [Kruc68] </ref> in the solution of partial differential equations.

Reference-contexts: By providing a guaranteed bound, we can be assured that the problem we have solved is indeed close enough to the specified problem to be of interest.

With our approach, ^x is the exact solution to a problem whose distance from the specified problem is guaranteed to be small. Lohner [Lohn87] computes an interval that is guaranteed to enclose the exact solution to the specified problem. These are complementary approaches; each has its own domain of applicability. Our guaranteed control of the defect and Lohner's guaranteed enclosure of the solution are connected by the condition number of the differential equation.

Reference-contexts: We can do this computation because the problem of bounding the range of a function is a very well studied problem in interval analysis (see <ref> [Moor79] </ref> or [Ratc84]). The step-size control strategy comes from determining a step h for which we can guarantee that jjffi (t)jj " for all t 2 [0; h], where jj jj is some 4 appropriate norm (usually L 1 ).

Reference-contexts: With our definition (recall that " = jjffi (t)jj), jjx ^xjj C jjffijj; in the limit as " ! 0: We can replace the above with a bound valid for all values of " by starting instead with the Alexeev-Grobner nonlinear variation of constants formula <ref> [Nors81] </ref>. Various difficulties hamper using the condition number to compute global error bounds: 1. It is hard to compute or bound C exactly. 2. Sometimes the quantity Cjjffijj is overly pessimistic. 3. Sometimes the global error jjx ^xjj is not of real interest. 4. Sometimes jjx ^xjj is too large.

Reference-contexts: Similarly for Hamiltonian systems, fixed time-step, symplectic methods appear to be superior <ref> [Sanz91] </ref>. For a wide range of problems, however, the ffi (t) term introduced by numerical methods can be viewed as one more in a sequence of reasonable simplifications made in the quest for an exact solution.

Reference-contexts: In contrast in the defect-controlled method, it is the difference between the small physical perturbations and the small numerical perturbation that is ignored. The idea of considering the defect is related to Wilkinson's idea of backward error analysis for linear systems <ref> [Wilk63] </ref>. It is in sharp contrast to the usual approach in interval mathematics of considering the accuracy of the 5 solution computed for the specified problem.

Reference-contexts: There is no remaining evidence of the ODE. The function ^x (t) is the true solution of the equation dx = f (x; t) + 32 1 t 4 + 9216 If we prefer to use the relative defect for the logistic equation, we get instead (using Mathematica <ref> [Wolf88] </ref>) ffi (t) := dt 1 t 2 (t 2 + 48t 228) : With either the absolute or the relative definition of ffi, we see in Figure 3 that jffi (t)j is small if h is small.
