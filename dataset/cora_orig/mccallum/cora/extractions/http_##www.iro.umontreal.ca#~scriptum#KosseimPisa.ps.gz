Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the problem of generating natural anaphora in assembly instructional texts. We first present a detailed account of grammatical and lexical anaphora and we examine a set of constraints for selecting these devices. As language is often redundant and an optimal referring expression is computationally prohibitive, we take the view that the generation of anaphora should be based on a thorough linguistic study and should lead to a natural choice, rather than an optimal one. We then present a text generation system built to evaluate the linguistic constraints. This component takes as input a specification of the sequence of actions to be performed in a cooking recipe and selects and produces the most appropriate anaphoric device to be used in the text.

Reference-contexts: Lexical anaphora is a very common phenomenon in any text; however, most studies on anaphora in text generation have only considered grammatical anaphora (e.g., pronouns). Moreover, past treatments of lexical anaphora (e.g., superor-dinates), rely mainly on conceptual taxonomic considerations <ref> [Dal92, Rei90, Gra84] </ref>, whereas we believe that lexical anaphora rules must be grounded in a detailed lexical semantic description of the textual genre. We take the view that the generation of anaphora should lead to a natural choice rather than an optimal one; and this, for two reasons. <p> This of course is not the case when narrative genres are considered.

Rules exhibited by Dale <ref> [Dal92] </ref> in English for generating pronouns in recipes cannot be transposed into French. For Dale, an obligatory element which refers back to the center (a verb complement may be obligatory, depending on the verb), can be lexicalized as a pronoun. <p> Its structure is parallel to the structure of the lexicon except for lexical gaps. As noted in section 1.2, objects in assembly instructional texts are rather dynamic; therefore, as already shown by Dale <ref> [Dal92] </ref>, to refer to these objects a text generator must model the objects' dynamic state. In our system, this modeling is done through the dictionary of concepts. Two basic concepts are stored: operations and participants. Participants are further classified as the agent, the objects manipulated (the ingredients) and the instruments. <p> Finally, the most natural anaphora is chosen to lexicalize the participants by satisfying the appropriate constraints. This last step will be fully described in the next section. 4.3 Selecting and Producing Anaphora To choose an anaphoric device, the distinction between initial and subsequent reference is usually made <ref> [Dal92, McD80] </ref>. However, in assembly texts the initial list of participants stated before the procedural instructions should be taken into account. For most participants, this list provides an initial reference; but not all anaphoric devices can trace their antecedent back to this previous paragraph.

Reference-contexts: Ellipsis obeys many constraints, some of them radically different in French from those governing pronominalization: The surface antecedent of an ellipsis may be quite distant, even in a previous paragraph, quite unlike the case for pronouns, which are never far from their antecedents in instructions <ref> [vDK83] </ref>. Pronouns are preferably produced to lexicalize sets of similar objects, i.e. objects having a close common superordinate. Actually, as we will see below, pronouns are more sensitive to local focus constraints, while ellipsis are more sensitive to global focus constraints.

Reference-contexts: In recipes, our ad hoc definition of saliency is the following: salient objects are main ingredients, while seasonings and instruments are less salient. Contrary to the focus space management proposed by Grosz and Sidner in <ref> [GS86] </ref>, we found that the elements contained in the ellipsis could refer to the elements contained in the previous sub-recipes. We thus include in the global focus stack the most salient local foci belonging to the previous discourse segments.

Reference-contexts: We speak of anaphora in terms of the process by which the anaphoric expression can be derived from the antecedent form (e.g., "partial repetition"), even though we envision a generation model which derives linguistic forms from conceptual representations under conceptual and linguistic constraints. Following Halliday and Hasan <ref> [HH76] </ref>, two main classes of anaphora can be distinguished: Grammatical anaphora uses lexemes which belong to a closed class (e.g. pronoun, definite article, demonstrative adjective) or no linguistic mark at all (in the case of ellipsis).

Reference-contexts: Also, a typical result nominalization (e.g., mixture) will be prefered if the state of the elements has radically changed. 4 Implementation To evaluate the linguistic constraints, a working text generation system has been implemented in Prolog <ref> [Kos92] </ref>. The goal of the system is to select and produce the most natural anaphora to refer to ingredients and instruments in cooking recipes. To test the constraints, the generator only needs to make tactical decisions.

Reference-contexts: It therefore assumes the existence of a text planner, whose output is taken as the input to the system. As almost all the rhetorical relations found in cooking recipes are action sequences [VL93], the input text plan exclusively specifies RST's relation of sequence <ref> [MT88] </ref>. That is, it only specifies user operations to be communicated in the text through action sequences. Figure 1 illustrates an example of the input text plan to make beef stew. Table 3, explained in detail later, shows the output text generated by the system.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 1. Text Plan for Beef Stew links are based on generic term, typical result and syntactic name derivate (the LFs Gener, S res and S 0 in the Meaning-Text Model <ref> [Mel84] </ref>). The conceptual dictionary stores the taxonomy of culinary concepts and allows the system to model the state change of the objects. Its structure is parallel to the structure of the lexicon except for lexical gaps.

Reference-contexts: Remove *its wings. b. Do you know that guy? His car is a real old Dodge. Lexico-grammatical constraints obviously do not vary according to the textual genre. 3.5 Lexico-Semantic Constraints To generate natural lexical anaphora, we require a well-developed lexico-semantic model. The lexical part of the Meaning-Text Model <ref> [MP87] </ref>, and in particular Lexical Functions (LF) enables one to systematize lexico-semantic relations to create direct and indirect coreferential relations between lexical items [TK92]. If a lexical gap occurs in text generation, LF compositions can also be used to create a lexical link.

At the end of cooking, add the spices. Moreover, it seems that the term introduced should not only be discriminating, but natural, as has been emphasized by Reiter <ref> [Rei90] </ref>, taking as a basis not only conceptual considerations, but also lexical use and lexical semantic considerations.

Reference-contexts: First, in a linguistically motivated work, the study of anaphora usage is more accurate when dealing with natural texts (which do not aim for optimality even in very utilitarian texts like instructions). Second, as shown by Reiter and Dale <ref> [RD92] </ref>, the computational complexity of generating optimal (minimally distinguishing) NPs is prohibitive. Overall, our work complements well Reiter and Dale's work [RD92]. The "nat-ural" approach is shared by both research projects, but the anaphoric devices studied are different. <p> Second, as shown by Reiter and Dale <ref> [RD92] </ref>, the computational complexity of generating optimal (minimally distinguishing) NPs is prohibitive.

In addition to grammatical anaphora, our work considers a wide range of lexical devices; while Reiter and Dale's work emphasizes distinguishing descriptions (what we call here partial repetitions).

They demonstrated that the taxonomy of concepts could be organized using a structure with three levels: superordinate, basic and subordinate.

It therefore assumes the existence of a text planner, whose output is taken as the input to the system. As almost all the rhetorical relations found in cooking recipes are action sequences <ref> [VL93] </ref>, the input text plan exclusively specifies RST's relation of sequence [MT88]. That is, it only specifies user operations to be communicated in the text through action sequences. Figure 1 illustrates an example of the input text plan to make beef stew.
