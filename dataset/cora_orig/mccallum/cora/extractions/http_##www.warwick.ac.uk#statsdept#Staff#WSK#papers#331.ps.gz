Abstract: In this paper we study the notion of an efficient coupling of Markov processes. Informally, an efficient coupling is one which couples at the maximum possible exponential rate, as given by the spectral gap. This notion is of interest not only for its own sake, but also of growing importance arising from the very recent advent of methods of "perfect simulation": it helps to establish the "price of perfection" for such methods. In general one can always achieve efficient coupling if the coupling is allowed to "cheat" (if each component's behaviour is affected by future behaviour of the other component), but the situation is more interesting if the coupling is required to be co-adapted. We present an informal heuristic for the existence of an efficient coupling, and justify the heuristic by proving rigorous results and examples in the contexts of finite reversible Markov chains and of reflecting Brownian motion in planar domains.

Also note that <ref> [1, Chapter 14 x7.1] </ref> describes another way of measuring how a Markov coupling may sacrifice efficiency, in the sense of mean coupling time of a graph-based Markov chain of size n increasing fast with n. <p> We examine this assertion in the next example and lemma. Example 3.1 Consider the long rectangle D = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 100] and let x = (1=4; 1), y = (3=4; 1). For these x and y, and the synchronous coupling, (3.3) will hold with = . <p> For these x and y, and the synchronous coupling, (3.3) will hold with = . This follows from the fact that the line K t will always stay parallel to the horizontal axis and so we are effectively dealing with a 1-dimensional Neumann problem on the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for which is the second eigenvalue. The second eigenvalue for the Laplacian in D is the same as for the interval [0; 100], i.e., 2 = =100. Hence, (3.3) may hold for some &gt; 2 and some x; y 2 D.

Reference-contexts: This last section is specialized to a very narrow family of processes but it is at least partly justified by the fact that the technique developed for this case has been subsequently successfully applied in a different context; indeed the methods discussed below have already been used in <ref> [3] </ref> to prove a number of positive results on the "hot spots" conjecture of J. Rauch, and more recently to construct a counterexample to the conjecture [5]. <p> We have chosen this example as the role of "partial ordering" is clear in this case. Moreover, our methods developed for this example have laid a foundation for some results on the "hot spots" conjecture of J. Rauch <ref> [3, 5] </ref>. We remark in passing that not much can be said about the exact values of eigenvalues for reflected Brownian motion in a triangle: see [27, 28] for the equilateral case. We will discuss "synchronous" and "mirror" couplings. <p> a classical result ("Mercer's Theorem") that p (t; x; y) = c 1 + ' 2 (x)' 2 (y)e 2 t + R (t; x; y); (3.2) where R (t; x; y) converges to 0 faster than e 2 t as t ! 1 uniformly in x and y (see <ref> [3, Proposition 2.1] </ref> for a recent proof). <p> This we cannot say but our examples may be a source of inspiration for future research in this direction. Second, the mirror coupling techniques developed for this project have already been applied <ref> [3, 5] </ref> to a problem on "hot spots." Hence, the techniques seem to have some interest beyond the efficiency of Markovian couplings. The reader might have noticed that the assumption that D is a triangle, adopted in Section 3, does not play a major role in the arguments. <p> Hence, the mirror cannot turn more than in D 4 . This is all we have to know to prove that the mirror coupling is efficient in D 4 . It is also possible to make some progress if a symmetry is present: Example 4.4 In <ref> [3] </ref> it is proved that the mirror cannot turn more than in a convex domain D 5 if we assume in addition that 45 (1) D 5 has a line of symmetry S which intersects @D 5 at x and y, (2) jx zj _ jy zj &lt; jx yj for <p> This property holds if we impose some more assumptions on the slope of @D 5 . It should be noted that our methods cannot decide whether the mirror coupling is efficient for reflected Brownian motion in the domains considered in <ref> [3, Theorem 1.3 (A1)] </ref>. Those domains are assumed to have two perpendicular axes of symmetry. The proof of that result is based on the behavior of the mirror coupling for the reflected Brownian motion with absorption on one of the axes of symmetry.

Reference-contexts: Coupling techniques can be applied to obtain various estimates in probability and analysis, both in purely theoretical research and in situations directly related to applications. Their importance in applications has recently increased dramatically with the advent of coupling-based "perfect simulation" due to Propp and Wilson [29] and Fill <ref> [17] </ref>. It is now a matter of pressing importance better to understand the price which must be paid for using such coupling-based approaches the "price of perfection". <p> The literature on estimating the rate of convergence for Markov processes is enormous. The forthcoming book [1] or the articles [19, 26] may serve as starting points. The importance of monotonicity is explained in <ref> [17, x4] </ref>. Also note that [1, Chapter 14 x7.1] describes another way of measuring how a Markov coupling may sacrifice efficiency, in the sense of mean coupling time of a graph-based Markov chain of size n increasing fast with n. <p> Estimating the coupling exponent fl itself may be a hard task, especially when the state space and the transition 4 probabilities do not have a simple structure. Note however that the ideas of perfect simulation <ref> [17, 29] </ref> finesse this problem away in suitably regular cases. We will give several distinct formal definitions of efficiency, one for Markov processes with finite state space and continuous time, and two for reflected Brownian motion in planar domains.

Note however that the ideas of perfect simulation <ref> [17, 29] </ref> finesse this problem away in suitably regular cases. We will give several distinct formal definitions of efficiency, one for Markov processes with finite state space and continuous time, and two for reflected Brownian motion in planar domains. <p> Then the coupling is efficient. We will show in Examples 2.9 and 2.10 that neither of the conditions in parts (i) and (ii) of Theorem 2.6 is necessary. Theorem 2.6 should be compared with <ref> [29, x5] </ref>, which implies that bounded monotone Markov chains are efficient. Proof of Theorem 2.6: (i) Suppose that the coupling (X 1 ; X 2 ) has the transposition property relative to some x 1 .

Reference-contexts: This is related to several recent papers on applications of couplings to estimation of the spectral gap for diffusions on manifolds; see for example [7, 9, 33]. An extensive bibliography of the notion of couplings as used in spectral gap theory is to be found in [8]: also see <ref> [30] </ref> for a useful introductory account of analytical approaches. Wide applications of the coupling technique inevitably lead to the question, which couplings are "good" and which are not? Chen [6, 7] has contributed to this question, introducing a concept of "optimal" couplings.

Reference-contexts: In the following lemma, P z and E z will denote the distribution of Z starting from z and the corresponding expectation. Conditioning by a harmonic function h will be reflected in the notation by writing P z h and E z discussion of conditioned Brownian motion and <ref> [31] </ref> for conditioning of general Markov processes. We will denote the space-time counterpart of Z by V . More precisely, if Z has law P z , then the law of the space-time process V=fV t = (Z t ; s t); t 0g will be denoted P z;s .

Reference-contexts: The second family of examples is concerned with reflected Brownian motion in planar domains. This is related to several recent papers on applications of couplings to estimation of the spectral gap for diffusions on manifolds; see for example <ref> [7, 9, 33] </ref>. An extensive bibliography of the notion of couplings as used in spectral gap theory is to be found in [8]: also see [30] for a useful introductory account of analytical approaches. <p> We will call fl the coupling exponent. The above argument has been used in various forms to estimate 2 , as for example in [9, Theorem 1.7], or <ref> [33] </ref>. The following informal definition and heuristic capture the spirit of the re sults and examples of this paper. Informal Definition of Efficiency. <p> We will discuss "synchronous" and "mirror" couplings. The synchronous couplings have been studied, for example, by Cranston and Le Jan [12, 13]. The mirror couplings seem to be a more effective tool than the synchronous couplings for estimating the spectral gap <ref> [33] </ref>. We will start with synchronous couplings. Our results are not as complete in this case as in the case of mirror couplings and for this reason this part of the presentation is less technical. First we will give a construction of the synchronous coupling. <p> The motivation for our efforts comes from two different sources. First, mirror couplings have been used to estimate the spectral gap for some diffusions <ref> [33] </ref> so it is a natural question how sharp those estimates are. This we cannot say but our examples may be a source of inspiration for future research in this direction.
