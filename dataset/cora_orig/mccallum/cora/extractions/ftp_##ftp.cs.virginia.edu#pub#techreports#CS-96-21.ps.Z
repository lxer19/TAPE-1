Abstract: Background traffic models are fundamental to packet-level network simulation since the background traffic impacts packet drop rates, queuing delays, end-to-end delay variation, and also determines available network bandwidth. In this paper, we present a statistical characterization of wide-area traffic based on a week-long trace of packets exchanged between a large campus network, a state-wide educational network, and a large Internet service provider. The results of this analysis can be used to provide a basis for modeling background load in simulations of wide-area packet-switched networks such as the Internet, contribute to understanding the fractal behavior of wide-area network utilization, and provide a benchmark to evaluate the accuracy of existing traffic models. The key findings of our study include the following: (1) both the aggregate and its component substreams exhibit significant long-range dependencies in agreement with other recent traffic studies, (2) the empirical probability distributions of packet arrivals are log-normally distributed, (3) packet sizes exhibit only short-term correlations, and (4) the packet size distribution and correlation structure are independent from both network utilization and time of day.

Reference-contexts: The network monitor used to collect the trace consists of a powerful workstation 1 , a kernel customized to have large network buffers, and a kernel-level packet filter <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We divide the aggregate stream into 14 substreams based on their destination IP addresses (for a review of this area, refer to <ref> [4] </ref>). Table 1 gives the network mask used to define the component substreams and the percentage of packets each substream contributes to the aggregate stream.

Reference-contexts: As we will see, the packet arrivals have long-range dependencies and are fractal in nature; that is, exhibit burstiness over multiple time scales (for a review of this subject, see <ref> [5] </ref>). Background traffic models must be able to model such long-range dependencies, otherwise simulated packet drop rates, variation in network transmission delay, and available network throughput may be severely underestimated.

Reference-contexts: Background traffic models are a fundamental component of packet-level network simulators since the network load drives the packet drop rate, queuing delay, end-to-end delay variation, and available network throughput <ref> [6] </ref>. Developing background traffic models suitable for use in a large-scale, packet switched network simulation (e.g., an Internet backbone network simulator) is a difficult problem because wide-area traffic dynamics are not well understood.
