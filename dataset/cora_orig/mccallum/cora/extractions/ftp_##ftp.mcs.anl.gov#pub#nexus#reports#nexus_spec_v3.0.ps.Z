Abstract: Nexus is a set of services that can be used to implement various task-parallel languages, data-parallel languages, and message-passing libraries. Nexus is designed to permit the efficient, portable implementation of individual parallel programming systems and the interoperability of programs developed with different tools. Nexus supports light-weight threading and active message technology, allowing integration of message passing and threads.
