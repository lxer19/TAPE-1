Abstract: The shape of the cornea has a large effect on visual performance. Recent advances in corneal topography measurement technology can provide detailed information about the subtle shape of the corneal surface. This data is desired by a variety of professionals, including clinicians, surgeons, and vision scientists. However, for this complex data to be useful, it must be presented in a way that can be interpreted accurately and efficiently. Such a problem is well-suited for a computer graphics solution using scientific visualization methods. We propose several visualization techniques and describe a suite of visualization software implementing these techniques.

Reference-contexts: A smooth mathematical surface must be reconstructed before the shape data can be used by visualization software. An algorithm for reconstructing a smooth surface is described in a related paper. <ref> [2] </ref> 1 3 Visualization Background Scientific visualization, or simply visualization, is a method where data is communicated graphically using a computer to facilitate the understanding by a human observer. Of course, a set of data can be presented in a variety of ways.

Reference-contexts: The video camera takes a digital picture of the reflected ring pattern which can then be analyzed by a computer. The corneal shape can be recovered from this image with a high degree of accuracy. <ref> [3] </ref> 2.2 Data Reconstruction As mentioned above, corneal shape data retrieved from a videokeratograph can be analyzed by a computer. The visualization software described in this paper uses such data. However, the data output from a videokeratograph is in the form of sample values rather than a full surface description.

Reference-contexts: techniques and present a corresponding suite of visualization software. 2 Corneal Topography Measurement Corneal surface data is useful in many areas of eye care, and sophisticated methods and instruments have been developed to measure this data. 2.1 Videokeratography The videokeratograph is an instrument with a conically-shaped target containing luminous rings. <ref> [4] </ref> A video camera is mounted at the center of the target to record the reflected image. The video camera takes a digital picture of the reflected ring pattern which can then be analyzed by a computer.

Reference-contexts: Not only can the visualization method determine how easily the data is interpreted, but it can influence the impressions of the data. As <ref> [5] </ref> says, "The principal objective of visualization in scientific computing is to develop techniques that make perceptible the most important informational aspects of a data set." Failure to do so could result in a misleading impression of the data even if the presentation is valid.
