Title: A look-ahead Schur Algorithm  
Author: Kyle Gallivan Srikanth Thirumalai Paul Van Dooren 
Abstract: The classical Schur algorithm computes the LDL T factorization of a symmetric Toeplitz matrix in O(n 2 ) operations, but requires that all the principal minors of the matrix be nonsingular. Look-ahead schemes have been proposed to deal with matrices that have exactly singular principal minors [9], [11]. Unfortunately, these algorithms cannot be extended to matrices that have ill-conditioned principal minors. Consequently, the relative errors obtained using the classical Schur algorithm on matrices having ill-conditioned principal minors is very poor. In this paper, we propose a look-ahead scheme for such matrices and present empirical results which demonstrate the improvement over the classical Schur algorithm for symmetric Toeplitz matrices with ill-conditioned principal minors. 1

A weakness of this approach is that the algorithms in [5] and [9] cannot be used when the first k 1 leading principal minors of T are ill-conditioned rather than exactly singular. <p> In such cases the algorithm in <ref> [5] </ref> and [9] with a look-ahead step of k can be used. A weakness of this approach is that the algorithms in [5] and [9] cannot be used when the first k 1 leading principal minors of T are ill-conditioned rather than exactly singular. We propose here an alternate method to do a look-ahead step of size k when the minors are ill-conditioned.
