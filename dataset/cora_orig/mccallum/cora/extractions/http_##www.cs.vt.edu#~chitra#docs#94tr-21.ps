Abstract: Chitra94 is the third generation of a comprehensive system to visualize, transform, statistically analyze, and model ensembles of trace data and validate the resultant models. The tool is useful for deriving input data models from trace data as well as for analysis of trace data output by a simulation. The tool uses a stochastic (possibly non-Markovian) process as its fundamental modeling component. The tool is unique in several respects. First, it focuses on the dynamic characterization of systems. Consequently it includes tests for homogeneity of ensembles, stationarity of individual traces, and the ability to partition ensembles into transient and stationary pieces. Second, Chitra94 is a scalable performance tool: its methods are designed to work with an arbitrary number of traces in an ensemble so that a user can examine the variability of system behaviors across different traces (representing different observation periods, different system configurations, etc.) To analyze multiple traces, the user can either (1) map the traces to a model that characterizes the dynamic behavior or (2) use a novel visualization, the mass evolution graph, that shows the probability mass distribution evolution of one or more traces. A mass evolution graph is easily constructed from trace data, and the derivatives of the paths it contains yield an estimate of probability mass as a function of time. Third, it analyzes categorical, not just numerical, time series data. Categorical data arises naturally in many computer and communication system modeling problems. Fourth, it includes a library of transforms that reduce the state space of the stochastic process generated. Fifth, Chitra94 is implemented as a user extensible collection of small programs, organized as a library, which allows the user to write new library modules that use existing modules to automate analysis procedures. Instead, Chitra94 may be invoked from command line, under a GUI, or integrated with another tool (e.g., a simulation model development or CASE tool). The use of Chitra94 is illustrated on a variety of trace data, and the extensibility is illustrated on the problem of partitioning an ensemble of 60 traces of compressed entertainment video into mutually exclusive, exhaustive, and homogeneous subsets from which a hierarchical workload model is derived. fl This work was supported in part by National Science Foundation grants NCF-9211342 and CDA-9121999. Funding for this work was also provided by the NSF to SUCCEED (Cooperative Agreement No. EID-9109853).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Chitra 1 is an experimental lab for investigating the dynamic behavior of trace data <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. This paper describes Chitra94, the third generation of a tool that couples visualization and statistical analysis of trace data. Chitra94 is comprehensive in its approach to analyzing trace data: 1. Chitra94 does not analyze just a single trace file, but multiple traces, termed an ensemble, simultaneously. <p> A set of trace files are homogeneous with respect to some system attribute if the samples of those attributes contained in the traces are drawn from the same population or from identical distributions. Chitra94 provides three methods; the first is a formal statistical test. Abrams, Lee, Cadiz, and Ganugapati <ref> [2] </ref> illustrate the use of all three methods to collect evidence as to whether an ensemble representing a database on a parallel computer is homogeneous. <p> The output of the m.chai.ens command is an i-step transition matrix, where i is the best predictor position, along with the p-values of each position in the window to justify why the selected position was chosen. Details on the CHAID-based model and an illustration of its use appear in <ref> [2] </ref>. 3.5.3 Model by Univariate the Ensemble: m.uni.ens This is a special case of CHAID, used when one wants to find the best predictor for a single state, rather than multiple states. 3.6 Avoiding State Space Explosion To reduce the number of states required to model the ensemble, a user applies <p> Transforms are defined and illustrated in <ref> [1, 2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Yet one might unknowingly use a numerical method on the data 4 and come to a false conclusion. To illustrate, consider a simulation of a communication network that uses a synchronous adaptive shortest path routing algorithm. The algorithm has been shown theoretically to generate oscillations <ref> [3] </ref>. The simulation generates a finite sequence of routes used in the network. Routes are not numeric quantities because there no ordering relationship exists; thus routes are categorical. Suppose we wish to examine to the sequence to see if there exists any oscillations in routes.

The state space of the chain is the set of model states, M (E v ), that occur in ensemble version E v .

Reference-contexts: This paper presents the modules currently in Chitra94, which are continually being refined and augmented. Chitra94 has three uses. First, it can be used to derive a non-executable, artificial workload model (using Ferrari, Serazzi and Zeigner's terminology <ref> [5, p. 53] </ref>) from an ensemble of trace data. The model, based on stochastic processes, is typically used to drive a simulation of a system, or to solve an analytic system model. <p> In addition, Chitra94 also flags trace data as numerical, categorical, or mixed, so that the analyst can be warned if a numerical analysis method (e.g., visualization using a Gantt chart or autocorrelation) is applied to categorical data. 1.4 Related Work Little of the workload modeling literature (e.g., <ref> [16, 5, 9] </ref>) is concerned with representing the dynamic or time-dependent behavior of workloads. In recent years visualization tools have provided a new way to explore dynamic behavior in systems. General purpose commercial scientific visualization tools, such as PV-WAVE and AVS, can be used. <p> One of two quantities may be tested: (a) the model states arising in each trace, or (b) the occupancy time samples of a selected state arising in each state. (These two essentially test the first two of four definitions of "representativeness of a model" given by Ferrari, Serazzi and Zeigner <ref> [5, pp. 45-46] </ref>.) To use the test, the user selects a significance level for the 2 test that underlies the KW method and, for (b), a single state that occurs in all traces. The null hypothesis tested is that the samples in all traces are drawn from identical distributions. <p> For each model state, Chitra94 represent as a histogram the cumulative distribution function of occupancy time samples. The synthesizers (x3.7) generate a [0,1] random variable, and inverse map it using the cumulative distribution function to obtain a random variate <ref> [5, pp. 79-80] </ref>. Chitra94 displays in model view statistics of occupancy time and a one step probability transition matrix, P . The transition rate matrix can be calculated from the occupancy time statistics and P (Fig. 12).

Reference-contexts: Frames are transmitted at a constant rate, so the model needs only to generate a frame length sequence. The specific data we use in our illustration here is 60 segments of the movie Star Wars available on the Internet from Garrett and Vetterli <ref> [6] </ref>. The data uses a discrete cosine transform and entropy encoding of monochrome frames for display in a window of size 480 lines by 504 pixels. 17 First observe that none of Chitra94's models can be used directly. There are two reasons.

Reference-contexts: Formally, an ensemble is homogeneous if a hypothesis of homogeneity is true. Examples of hypotheses are: the occupancy times of a particular state are drawn from the same distribution, the same set of transitions are present in each member, a run (sequence of state transitions <ref> [7] </ref>) arises with about the same frequence in each member. A user tests an ensemble for homogeneity. If the test fails, then the user partitions the ensemble members such that members in each partition are homogeneous.

Reference-contexts: There are two reasons. First, entertainment movies display time dependent behavior: a dialogue scene with a white backdrop resembling teleconferencing traffic characteristics (e.g., <ref> [8] </ref>) may be followed by a high motion rate scene with complex detail. Second, the frame lengths are positive integers bounded above by 78,459 bytes.

Reference-contexts: Position -1 is a Markov model. A position of +4 means that the state of interest is best predicted by the state that arises four states later. The prediction is obtained using CHAID (Chi-squared automatic interaction detection) <ref> [10] </ref>. CHAID originated as a technique to analyze a data set that contains vectors in which one component represents the categories of a dependent variable and the remainder represent the categories of a set of independent variables.

General purpose commercial scientific visualization tools, such as PV-WAVE and AVS, can be used. In addition tools specific to computer and communication systems have been designed. The closest to our work are Traceview <ref> [11] </ref> and Pablo [15]. Pablo contains a library of Motif widgets to visualize and analyze data; furthermore a graphical interface is used to graphically build a data flow graph. <p> Chitra94 also provides a command to superimpose the mean of a process (v.smooth), because a shift in the mean indicates non-stationarity. Several smoothing functions are provided, based on a uniformly and an exponentially weighted moving average with an optional window over which data is averaged. Traceview <ref> [11] </ref> also plots a uniformly weighted smoothing curve, although for a different purpose. 3.5 Modeling Ensembles Chitra94 at present contains the three models described below. 3.5.1 Model by a semi-Markov Chain the Ensemble: m.sm.ens The normal representation of a stochastic process X E v (t) in Chitra94 is as a time

Reference-contexts: Second, they are limited to traces with numerical system state vector components. Chitra94's 5 attempt to handle both ensembles and categorical data as first class problems is unique. However, one system of note is IPS-2 <ref> [12] </ref>, which was designed for performance evaluation of parallel and distributed systems. IPS-2 constructs an activity graph from a single trace (similar to Chitra94's construction of a state transition matrix in x3.5.1).

Reference-contexts: It should be possible to incorporate the tool into another tool (e.g., incorporate Chitra94 into an existing CASE or simulation model development tool). Experience from older performance analysis tool projects show that integration is very clumsy with a monolithic tool with its own custom GUI <ref> [13] </ref>. Finally, the tool should be portable across hardware, operating systems, and GUI's 6 (especially Unix/Motif and Windows for PC's).

These characteristics motivated us to design Chitra94 as a set of small commands that are composed into an analysis procedure using a shell script. <p> A CF file represents data as space separated columns of data augmented with header lines that contain a pound sign in column one. Each heaer line lists one attribute of the data. We chose to define a new format (i.e., CF) over an existing one, such as Pablo's SDDF <ref> [15] </ref>, specifically to use a format that can be directly usable by Unix utilities (e.g., sort and grep) or exported into other performance analysis tools.

Reference-contexts: This is because Chitra94 is designed to be used in conjunction with other tools of the analyst's choice. It is straightforward to export Chitra94's standard file format (described in x2.2) to other tools, such as UniFit II <ref> [17] </ref> for fitting distributions.
