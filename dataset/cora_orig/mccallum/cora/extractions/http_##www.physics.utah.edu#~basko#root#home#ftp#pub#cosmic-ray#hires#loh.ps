Abstract: Air fluorescence in the region 310 nm to 400 nm is due to nitrogen fluorescence.[1] We measured the nitrogen fluorescence yield in air as a function of pressure between 1.4 MeV and 1 GeV by means of a strontium fi source and an electron beam. The pressure dependency of nitrogen fluorescence is well described by a formula derived from simple kinetic theory. Results indicate that nitrogen fluorescence yield in air is proportional to electron energy loss from 1.4 MeV to 1 GeV. The dE/dx relativistic rise in air is detected.

Reference-contexts: Those experiments were carried out with low energy (below tens of keV) electrons at low pressure in order to study production cross sections. Due to a suggestion by Suga <ref> [2] </ref> that nitrogen fluorescence (NF) induced by particle cascades can be used to detect high energy cosmic rays, Bunner [3] measured the NF in air using 3.93 MeV singly ionized alpha particles.

He and others found that NF in the presence of oxygen at any pressure is greatly reduced due to collision de- excitation between nitrogen and oxygen molecules. NF yield decreases slowly with pressure and temperature.
