Abstract: We describe an artificial intelligence (AI) system (CTSHIV) that connects the scientific AIDS literature describing specific HIV drug resistances directly to the Customized Treatment Strategy of a specific HIV patient. Rules in the CTSHIV knowledge base encode knowledge about sequence mutations in the HIV genome that have been found to result in drug resistance in the HIV virus. Rules are applied to the actual HIV sequences of the virus strains infecting the specific patient undergoing clinical treatment in order to infer current drug resistance. A search through mutation sequence space identifies nearby drug resistant mutant strains that might arise. The possible drug treatment regimens currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are considered and ranked by their estimated ability to avoid identified current and nearby drug resistant mutants. The highest-ranked treatments are recommended to the attending physician. The result is more precise treatment of individual HIV patients, and a decreased tendency to select for drug resistant genes in the global HIV gene pool. The application is currently in use in human clinical trials on HIV patients. Initial results from a small clinical trial are encouraging and further clinical trials are planned. From an AI viewpoint the case study demonstrates the extensibility of knowledge-based systems because it illustrates how existing encoded knowledge can be used to support new applications that were unanticipated when the original knowledge was encoded. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes progressive deterioration of the immune system leading almost invariably to AIDS and death from opportunistic cancers and infections. Currently in the USA it is estimated to infect 3-5 million persons, is the leading cause of death in adults from age 14 to 35, and is the nation's leading cause of productive years of life lost aggregated over all age groups. HIV is estimated to infect 40-50 million persons worldwide (CDC 1997). The high rate of HIV viral mutation both makes development of a vaccine difficult and results in rapid positive selection for drug resistant mutant strains. Recent multi-drug combination therapies are encouraging, but in most cases ultimately fail due to the development of drug resistance (O'Brian et al. 1996). A general theory of HIV drug resistance still is not in hand, but a number of specific sequence mutations in the HIV genome have been described in the scientific literature and associated with increased resistance to certain drugs. In this paper we describe an AI system intended to improve the clinical treatment of individual HIV patients by identifying drug resistance in advance and avoiding it in treatment. This is done by first identifying drug resistant HIV mutant strains that already exist in the patient or are likely to be positively selected for by certain treatments, and then recommending a customized treatment designed to avoid selection of such mutants. The result is more precise treatment of individual HIV patients, and a decreased tendency to select for drug resistant genes in the global HIV gene pool.

Reference-contexts: HAART typically results in a dramatic drop in viral load within two weeks, often sustained for long periods of time. Enthusiasm for the potential of HAART to eradicate HIV has been tempered by the inevitable failure of these regimens due to the eventual development of drug resistance <ref> (Carpenter et al. 1996) </ref>. The virus appears to remain in a proviral state in resting memory T-cells, where it is inaccessible to antiretroviral drugs (Wong et al. 1997; Finzi et al. 1997). Mutations still can occur under HAART, though the mutation rate is greatly decreased (Jacobsen et al. 1996).

Reference-contexts: In a full-blown case of AIDS, it is estimated that every single point mutation appears every day, every coordinated pair of point mutations appears once or more during the course of the infection, and even coordinated triples of point mutations may appear <ref> (Condra et al. 1995) </ref>. A drug typically works by blocking a key part of the virus life cycle.

Reference-contexts: Sadly, increasing prevalence of drug resistant strains in the HIV global gene pool means that new patients may be infected by mu tant strains that already have accrued resistance from previous hosts <ref> (Gu et al. 1994) </ref>. Consequently it is important to avoid selecting for drug resistant mutants. Combination treatments involving multiple drugs are one approach to avoiding drug resistance (Lange 1995). If the virus mutates to resist one drug but still is inhibited by another, it may be suppressed or unviable.

Reference-contexts: For example, one such rule in CTSHIV is: IF Methionine is encoded by RT codon 151, THEN do not use AZT, ddI, d4T, or ddC. [weight= 1:0] <ref> (Iversen et al. 1996) </ref> The weight associated with a rule is not a confidence as in many expert systems. Rather, it reflects the estimated level of resistance to a particular drug, and is part of the consequent.

Reference-contexts: The virus appears to remain in a proviral state in resting memory T-cells, where it is inaccessible to antiretroviral drugs (Wong et al. 1997; Finzi et al. 1997). Mutations still can occur under HAART, though the mutation rate is greatly decreased <ref> (Jacobsen et al. 1996) </ref>. There are important limitations of the approach below. Sequence-based rules capture only part of the domain knowledge about drug resistance, albeit a clinically useful part. Drug resistance may arise for other domain-specific reasons that cannot be represented easily as rules.

Reference-contexts: The first rule set was completed in May, 1996. The first rule-based system prototype was developed to identify current resistance already present in the patient's HIV infection (Pazzani et al. 1997b). It was coded in FOCL-1-2-3 <ref> (Pazzani & Kibler 1992) </ref>, a LISP based expert shell. It was begun in March, 1996, and completed in June, 1996. It was re-coded in JAVA between April and June of 1997 (Pazzani et al. 1997a).

Reference-contexts: All patients had detectable viral load at baseline (mean log 10 load of 4:67 2:16), weakened immune system (CD4 counts &lt; 500 cells/mm 3 ), and failure of at least one previous antiviral treatment regimen. While these trials are still ongoing, initial results are encouraging <ref> (See et al. 1998) </ref>. At three months, 10 of 15 patients who had failed at least one prior treatment regimen had an undetectable viral load (67% success). This compares to about 20% in everyday practice in the same patient population.
