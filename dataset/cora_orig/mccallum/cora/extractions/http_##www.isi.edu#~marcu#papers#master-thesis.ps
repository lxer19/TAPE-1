Reference-contexts: Therefore, to prove that ff follows from , it is enough to construct a closed tableau having as root the formulas [ :ff. In what follows, we will use the terminology related to classical propositional tableaux given by <ref> [ Bell and Machover, 1986 ] </ref> . We generalize the classical propositional tableaux, such that if a given stratified propositional tableau T for a given theory 0 has been obtained, we are allowed to extend it into a new one T 0 by any of the following three rules. <p> If we reconsider now the example involving Tweety, m 0 is more optimistic than m 1 and this corresponds to our intuitions. 2.5 First-order stratified logic We now discuss the first-order extension of stratified logic. The reader is referred to <ref> [ Bell and Machover, 1986 ] </ref> for a comprehensive study of classical first-order logic. 2.5.1 Syntax In order to interpret stratified terms and formulas, it is necessary to fix a stratified structure or stratified interpretation SL consisting of the following elements: * A non-empty class D called the universe of discourse, <p> Lemma 2.5.5 Every x-unsatisfiable countable or finite set of sentences has a possibly infinite tableau in which every branch is used up. Proof: The proofs of the last two lemmas follow exactly the same steps as the ones for classical first-order logic found in <ref> [ Bell and Machover, 1986 ] </ref> . One can notice that the last three definitions do not prohibit the existence of infinite branches. However, in our domain, we will use function symbols mainly to formalize sentences.

Reference-contexts: According to Frege, constructions such as the heavenly body which has the greatest distance from the earth or the series with the least convergence <ref> [ Frege, 1892, p. 87 ] </ref> certainly have some sense, but it is doubtful they have a nominatum. Therefore, the grasping of a particular sense does not with certainty warrant a corresponding nominatum [ Frege, 1892, p. 87 ] . <p> heavenly body which has the greatest distance from the earth or the series with the least convergence <ref> [ Frege, 1892, p. 87 ] </ref> certainly have some sense, but it is doubtful they have a nominatum. Therefore, the grasping of a particular sense does not with certainty warrant a corresponding nominatum [ Frege, 1892, p. 87 ] . However, from a logical perspective, Frege rejects the words which do not refer: He who does not acknowledge the nominatum cannot ascribe or deny a predicate to it. <p> For Frege, whenever something is asserted, the presupposition taken for granted is that the employed proper names, simple or compound, have nominata <ref> [ Frege, 1892, p. 95 ] </ref> . Therefore, it is impossible to account for the cancellation of the pragmatic inferences. Moreover, sentences such as (5.4), (5.5), (5.6), or (5.7) are impossible to represent.

Reference-contexts: However, the implicature is felicitously defeasible if A utters: (1.19) A: My car's not working, but I'll take my wife's. Further work in the field of quantity implicatures <ref> [ Horn, 1972, Gazdar, 1979 ] </ref> gave rise to two important sub-cases of what today are called conventional implicatures. The first is scalar implicatures. <p> Pragmatic approaches offer a variety of definitions for presupposition that differ primarily in the role played by context [ Karttunen, 1974 ] , by the conversational participants [ Stalnaker, 1973 ] or by the logic and pragmatic relation between these factors and presupposition <ref> [ Gazdar, 1979, Horton, 1987 ] </ref> . <p> In these conditions, it becomes clear why the presuppositions are the last pieces of information that are added to the conversational context. From our perspective, of maximal importance is the fact that Gazdar formalizes presuppositions, in positive environments, as logical implications <ref> [ Gazdar, 1979, p. 140 ] </ref> . As we will show in section 1.3, this is a logical mistake. 1.2.4 Mercer An orthogonal approach is taken by Mercer [ 1982, 1987, 1988b, 1988a, 1990, 1991 ] . He abandons the projection method for rules of inference in default logic. <p> As we will show, many pragmatic inferences are not subject to this behavior, i.e., they do not obey the contrapositive rule, so they are not representable in first-order logic using material implication. 13 It has been already shown <ref> [ Gazdar, 1979, p. 90 ] </ref> that a definition of presuppositions in terms of entailment is a logical mistake. To fix the problem, one would be tempted to treat presuppositions as defeasible information (see 1.2.4 for such an approach).

Reference-contexts: The results obtained here offer a computational explanation for Geis's work <ref> [ Geis, 1982 ] </ref> . In his study of the language of TV advertising, Geis noticed that most of the information that bombards one during the commercial breaks is conveyed using pragmatic effects. Implicatures and presuppositions are the carriers of this information.

Reference-contexts: Other kinds of implicature come about by blatantly not following some maxims. These give the floating implicatures. For example, by answering with (1.17) A: My car's not working. to a question such as (1.18) B: Can I get a ride with you? <ref> [ Green, 1989, p. 92 ] </ref> one presumably implicates that because his car is not working, he cannot provide a ride for B. However, the implicature is felicitously defeasible if A utters: (1.19) A: My car's not working, but I'll take my wife's.

Reference-contexts: The beauty of his theory emanates from a very small set of conversational principles or maxims that are the linguistic expression of a more general form of human cooperative behavior <ref> [ Grice, 1975, p. 47 ] </ref> . Here follow these principles: Maxims of quality Try to make your contribution one that is true. 1. Do not say what you believe to be false. 2. Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence. 2 Maxims of quantity 1.

Reference-contexts: But this is because there is usually very little to be said about what there is not, and not because an empty name is a logical misnomer <ref> [ Hintikka, 1959, p. 127 ] </ref> . Hintikka's belief is that the meaningfulness and the logical status of names and of other singular terms is not affected by the failure to refer. <p> Hintikka's belief is that the meaningfulness and the logical status of names and of other singular terms is not affected by the failure to refer. Hintikka states clearly that there are 78 existential presuppositions embodied in the usual systems of quantification theory <ref> [ Hintikka, 1959, p. 130 ] </ref> . To avoid this embedding, he explicitly introduces Quine's slogan, to exist is to be a value of a variable, in the Existential Generalization rule.

Reference-contexts: Particularized implicatures are valid only in a particular context. For example, one would normally infer (1.13) &gt; Perhaps the dog ate the roast beef. from (1.14) The dog looks happy. only in a context where (1.14) was uttered as an answer to (1.15) Where is the roast beef ? <ref> [ Horton, 1987, p. 2 ] </ref> This particularized implicature can be felicitously cancelled if instead of (1.14), one utters: (1.16) The dog looks happy, but it was here all the time. Other kinds of implicature come about by blatantly not following some maxims. These give the floating implicatures. <p> Pragmatic approaches offer a variety of definitions for presupposition that differ primarily in the role played by context [ Karttunen, 1974 ] , by the conversational participants [ Stalnaker, 1973 ] or by the logic and pragmatic relation between these factors and presupposition <ref> [ Gazdar, 1979, Horton, 1987 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: A solution for the projection problem should explain which of the pragmatic inferences are inherited by a structure that uses the constructs that bear them, and why. Gazdar [ 1979 ] makes a clear delineation between the projection of implicatures and presuppositions. Other researchers <ref> [ Karttunen and Peters, 1979, Soames, 1979, Soames, 1982 ] </ref> focus only on the projection of presuppositions. We are interested in a unified explanation for both phenomena.

Reference-contexts: This definition does not survive a logical examination because as Gazdar [ 1979, p. 90 ] has shown, the definition says that presuppositions are always true.

Reference-contexts: A more recent approach to the projection problem is built from the observation that the data challenging Gazdar's solution introduced by Soames, Heine, and Fauconnier concern 12 primarily hypothetical contexts and secondarily contexts of reported speech or thought. A theory based on these types of contexts is developed <ref> [ Kay, 1992 ] </ref> but no references are made for a possible formalism in which such a theory can be embedded, nor for a computational model of it.

Reference-contexts: A good reason for circumventing the notion of topicality is given by Lasersohn [ 1993 ] . 5.3.5 Lasersohn's context dependency We interpret Lasersohn's theory [ 1993 ] as a natural extension of Labov's work on the boundaries of words and their meaning <ref> [ Labov, 1973 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: [ 1949, p. 27 ] shows how Russell's method can be extended to include proper names, but this is done in a framework where To say that something does not exist, or that is something which is not is clearly a contradiction in terms; hence (x)(x :exists) must be true <ref> [ Quine, 1947, p. 150 ] </ref> . Hence, Quine's solution cannot accommodate the cancellation of presuppositions. Strawson's [ 1950 ] attack in the early fifties was only the beginning of the denial of the Russellian approach to presuppositions.

The interested reader can find our program in annex A. <p> A generalization of the Beth tableau technique provides the theoretical foundation for our implementation. Stratified logic is implemented in Common Lisp and it makes extensive use of the nondeterministic facilities of the Screamer system <ref> [ Siskind, 1991 ] </ref> . The result is a program that takes as input a set of stratified formulas that constitute the necessary semantic and pragmatic knowledge and the logical translation of an utterance or set of utterances and that computes a set of optimistic interpretations for the given utterances.

Reference-contexts: Pragmatic approaches offer a variety of definitions for presupposition that differ primarily in the role played by context [ Karttunen, 1974 ] , by the conversational participants <ref> [ Stalnaker, 1973 ] </ref> or by the logic and pragmatic relation between these factors and presupposition [ Gazdar, 1979, Horton, 1987 ] .

Reference-contexts: Some of them are clearly false (5.21), while others are ambiguous (5.22). (5.21) The King of France is sitting in that chair. (5.22) The King of France is bald.

An ordering relation, , is defined on the data sets: D D 0 if D 0 is a consistent superset of D.

Reference-contexts: Several variations on this definition have been developed using modal logic [ Karttunen, 1971 ] or a heavy-parentheses notation [ Katz and Langendoen, 1976 ] . A critique of these theories is given by Gazdar [ 1979, pp. 90-103 ] . Revivals of semantic theories are observed even later <ref> [ Wilson and Sperber, 1979 ] </ref> , where in order to circumvent the problems an ordered relation on the entailments is used. On the basis of this ordering, Sperber and Wilson distinguish between focalized and peripheral entailments.
