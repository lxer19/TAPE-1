Title: A View of One's Past and Other Aspects of Reasoned Change in Belief  
Author: Michael J. Miller, 
Degree: Doctor of Philosophy, 1993 Dissertation directed by: Associate Professor Donald Perlis  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science  
Note: Abstract Title of Dissertation:  
Abstract: This dissertation reports work on reasoned change in belief , specifically related to the following concepts: * pronominal indexicality in first-order logic (FOL) * typicality and range defaults * terminological (language) change over time Results are presented in each: (i) The pronominal indexical "I" its meaning changing with who is speaking is given formal treatment in the context of a logic puzzle, solving a problem previously posed in the literature. (ii) A new form of default information in which typicality is viewed as spreading over a range of possible default conclusions is isolated. "Cardinals are typically red or russet" is a reliable default while both "cardinals are typically red" and "cardinals are typically russet" are not. The range "red or russet" is essential, though shown to require adjustment of previous formalisms.

Reference-contexts: Indeed Brachman <ref> [ Brachman, 1985 ] </ref> discusses the very idea of reifying typical mental notions to represent defaults in frame-like inheritance networks, yet no one seems to have carried this out in a logic-based approach to see what, if any, advantages and/or shortcomings might arise. <p> There is no such confusion in the formalism we present here; a typ constant is, indeed, a "prototypical individual that somehow typifies the kind" ( <ref> [ Brachman, 1985 ] </ref> p 89.) We should point out that we are not taking a detailed stand on the psychological nature or properties of mental concepts, except to grant that they are highly idiosyncratic.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the logic itself must be specially tailored to be flexible or "active" enough to allow, even encourage, language change and usage change when necessary. As a theoretical tool the general step-logic framework developed in [ Elgot-Drapkin and Perlis, 1990 ] and <ref> [ Elgot-Drapkin, 1988 ] </ref> is well suited to these desiderata. But no heretofore developed step-logic offers a broad enough belief revision inference mechanism to suit our needs. <p> These additions to step-logics, namely the mechanisms enabling terminological change and those for dc-recovery, have allowed us to solve commonsense problems centered around object-identification error as we'll see in chapter 5. (Sections 4.1 and 4.2 are largely a synopsis of material found in <ref> [ Elgot-Drapkin, 1988 ] </ref> .) 4.1 Step-logics: An Inference Mechanism Traditional descriptions of non-monotonic reasoning envision non-monotonicity as a relationship between theories: From one theory certain theorems follow that do not follow from an enlarged theory augmented with additional information (axioms). <p> The distinguishing feature of the logics in this family is that they embody mechanisms for representing self-knowledge, time-situatedness, and belief retraction. (For full technical details of these mechanisms see <ref> [ Elgot-Drapkin, 1988 ] </ref> .) 4 See figure 4.3 for a set of rules which incorporates this idea. 65 An example of an actual inference function (called Inf B ) for an SL 7 step-logic corresponds to the rules given in figure 4.3 (adapted from [ Elgot-Drapkin, 1988 ] ). <p> details of these mechanisms see <ref> [ Elgot-Drapkin, 1988 ] </ref> .) 4 See figure 4.3 for a set of rules which incorporates this idea. 65 An example of an actual inference function (called Inf B ) for an SL 7 step-logic corresponds to the rules given in figure 4.3 (adapted from [ Elgot-Drapkin, 1988 ] ). <p> The thinking is this: Since the proper super-formulae are beliefs they are presumably "relevant" to the reasoner. So too then may be knowledge about any contained sub-formulae, including that they are not believed. 5 Earlier treatments of Contra (e.g., <ref> [ Elgot-Drapkin, 1988 ] </ref> ) considered it to be a ternary predicate in which the contradictands occupied the first two positions in its argument list and a step number occupied the third, i.e., Contra elgotd: (ff; fi; i). <p> Secondly, it will provide an opportunity to discuss several shortcomings of this, the heretofore most ambitious step-logic, that must be addressed before we proceed with the specifics of applying step-logics to reasoning about error and terminological change. (The example presented here is adapted from <ref> [ Elgot-Drapkin, 1988 ] </ref> .) Let our logic be defined by Inf B (figure 4.3) and Obs B (below): Obs B (j) = &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; P !

Delgrande helps point out another nice feature of our formalism by distinguishing the ability to reason with defaults from the ability to reason about defaults.

In uttering one statement, how can a rich knave convince the princess that he is indeed a prospective husband for her? 1 In <ref> [ Ohlbach, 1984 ] </ref> we find the framing and solution of this problem in a formal theorem-proving context using first-order logic (FOL). Though trying to write the problem in FOL may not appear to be difficult at first, it is shown by Ohlbach not to be entirely elementary.

We use a first-order theory, embellished with a quotation mechanism (see, for example, <ref> [ Perlis, 1985 ] </ref> ) which contains the following terms, predicate letters and function letters: I : constant (the word "I") knave : unary function letter (knave (x) stands for the term "x is a knave") rich : unary function letter not : unary function letter and : binary function letter <p> Let us introduce a new predicate letter, INAP (for "inappropriate"), and assume a quotation mechanism to reify wffs (in the style of <ref> [ Perlis, 1985 ] </ref> ) 8 to try to express this latter condition.

Reference-contexts: Regardless of the need for these aspects another difficulty arises when 7.8-7.10 are taken together together with, say, the wff "W (chair)". We would expect to get: LB (chair) _ DB (chair) (7:11) but 7.9 and 7.10 are counterexample axioms to 7.8 and <ref> [ Perlis, 1986 ] </ref> shows that 7.11 will not be proven without some additional machinery (such as the scoping mechanism of [ Etherington et al., 1990 ] ). 10 Ignoring the fact that 2 n 1 of these aspects would need to be introduced for each range default, where n is

The knights on the island always tell the truth, while the knaves always lie. Some of the knights are poor and the rest of them are rich.
