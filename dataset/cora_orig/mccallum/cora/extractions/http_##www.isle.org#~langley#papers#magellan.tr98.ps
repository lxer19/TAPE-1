Abstract: In this paper we describe Magellan, an integrated architecture for mobile robotics. The system represents its spatial knowledge in terms of a topological network that connects a set of distinct places, each represented by evidence grids that contain probabilistic descriptions of occupancy. Magellan includes a module for place recognition that determines its initial location and when it has reached a goal, a module for continuous localization that maintains accurate estimates of the robot's position, and a module for navigation that generates path plans and executes them using reactive behaviors. Experiments in two laboratories with different characteristics suggest that the system can operate robustly across a range of environments, including ones that involve dynamic changes. This work was funded by the Office of Naval Research under Grant No. N00014-94-1-0505. We thank Hans Moravec for sharing his software, and we thank Nils Nilsson and Barbara Hayes-Roth for providing access to their Nomad mobile robot.

Reference-contexts: In the network, each link between adjacent places includes a confidence value that represents the robot's estimate of how likely that link is to be traversable. The cost of each link is inversely proportional to this confidence value. Using these cost assignments, Magellan uses Dijkstra's algorithm <ref> (Bondy & Murty, 1976) </ref> to find the path with least cost from the current place C to the desired place D. Each path consists of a series of places connected by place links.

Reference-contexts: The method for place recognition described above works well for initialization, but it requires that the robot stop to construct a detailed map of its surroundings, which makes it impractical for continuous localization. In order to support localization without stopping, Magellan incorporates a method for correcting pose estimates incrementally <ref> (Schultz et al., 1996) </ref>. Using this technique, the system builds a series of short-term grids based on localized sensor readings and the current odometry, and then registers the short-term and long-term grids.

Reference-contexts: In previous research, we have developed methods for place recognition (Langley & Pfleger, 1995; Lan-gley, Pfleger, & Sahami, 1997; Yamauchi & Langley, 1997), continuous localization (Schultz, Adams, & Grefenstette, 1996; Graves, Schultz, & Adams, 1997), and adaptive navigation <ref> (Yamauchi & Beer, 1996) </ref>. <p> Topological maps have advantages for rapid navigation, whereas occupancy grids provide better spatial information for use in localization. Magellan incorporates both topological and grid representations. The system uses a topological map called an adaptive place network <ref> (Yamauchi & Beer, 1996) </ref> for navigation. These networks differ from traditional topological maps in that they support changes in their connections to reflect changes encountered in the world. <p> One difference is that their system describes its `places' in terms of sensor readings, whereas ours uses inferred evidence grids, which lets it represent the detailed structure of each place. We believe this provides a more general approach to place recognition that, as we have shown elsewhere <ref> (Yamauchi & Langley, 1996) </ref>, is robust even to substantial changes in the environment. On the other hand, Magellan currently relies on humans to identify useful places, whereas Kuipers and Byun's system invokes heuristics to learn places in an unsupervised manner. <p> In contrast, our place recognition system uses a separate grid for each place and has scaled effectively to large environments <ref> (Yamauchi & Langley, 1996) </ref>. Thrun and Bucken (1996) have integrated topological and grid representations for use in localization and navigation, but their approach assumes that walls will only be parallel or perpendicular to each other.
