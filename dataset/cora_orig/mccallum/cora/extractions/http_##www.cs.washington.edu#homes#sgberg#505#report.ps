Reference-contexts: To reduce the size of the tree, an optimization to the tree is performed right after abstraction. In this stage new combinators B, and C may be introduced in the tree. See <ref> [1] </ref> for a detailed discussion of the abstraction and optimization process. If the expression is not bound to a variable, it must be evaluated to display the result to the user.
