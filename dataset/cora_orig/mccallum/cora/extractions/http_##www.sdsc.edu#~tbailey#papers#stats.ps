Abstract: Position-specific scoring matrices are useful for representing and searching for protein sequence motifs. A sequence family can often be described by a group of one or more motifs, and an effective search must combine the scores for matching a sequence to each of the motifs in the group. We describe three methods for combining match scores and estimating the statistical significance of the combined scores and evaluate the search quality (classification accuracy) and the accuracy of the estimate of statistical significance of each. The three methods are: 1) sum of scores, 2) sum of reduced variates, 3) product of score p-values. We show that method 3) is superior to the other two methods in both regards, and that combining motif scores indeed gives better search accuracy. The mast sequence homology search algorithm utilizing the product of p-values scoring method is available for interactive use and downloading at URL http://www.sdsc.edu/MEME.

Reference-contexts: In this method, each column of each motif contributes a single, additive score to the combined match score. The "sum of reduced variates" method is analogous to the sum 17 statistics often used for evaluating multiple high scoring segments in pairwise sequence comparisons <ref> [ Altschul and Gish, 1996 ] </ref> . Each motif contributes a single, scaled score that are summed to form the combined score. The "product of p-values" method treats each match score as the test statistic in a hypothesis test of whether the motif is present in the target sequence.

Reference-contexts: Each point represents the average result for 75 sequence families. families chosen are listed in Bailey and Gribskov [1997]). The meme motif discovery program <ref> [ Bailey and Elkan, 1995 ] </ref> was used to generate a set of five motifs for each sequence family. This yielded a set of 75 distinct queries for which the correct classifications are known.

The random score distribution for a single motif is well approximated by a Gaussian extreme value (GEV) distribution.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, none of the previously available motif-search programs estimate the statistical significance of simultaneous matches to multiple motif queries. The mast (Motif Alignment and Search Tool) algorithm <ref> [ Bailey and Gribskov, 1998 ] </ref> used in this paper * accepts multiple motifs as the query, * allows the motifs to occur in any order (or be missing) from the target, * estimates the statistical significance of matches to the query. <p> Assuming motif independence, the p-values are independent and one minus the cumulative distribution function for g (s; Q) is approximated by <ref> [ Bailey and Gribskov, 1998 ] </ref> P r (g (s; Q) p) p i=0 i! for 0 &lt; p 1, and is zero when p is zero. 4 The p-value of the combined score is trivially computed from the cumulative distribution function. 3 Results To determine the best method of combining

Reference-contexts: This yielded a set of 75 distinct queries for which the correct classifications are known. To measure classification accuracy of each method, we calculated the combined p-value of each sequence in swiss-prot release 28 <ref> [ Bairoch, 1994 ] </ref> . Using the known family members for each query, we then computed the ROC 50 classification accuracy of the method.

Reference-contexts: Judging from our results, it is clearly better to weight all motifs equally when classifying sequences. This is interesting in view of the fact that both the Smith-Waterman sequence alignment algorithm [ Smith and Waterman, 1981 ] and hidden Markov models <ref> [ Eddy, 1995; Krogh et al., 1994 ] </ref> , an alternative method of describing sequence families, use a scoring method which is closely akin to our sum of scores method.

Reference-contexts: The "product of p-values" method treats each match score as the test statistic in a hypothesis test of whether the motif is present in the target sequence. The p-values of the scores are combined by multiplying them together, as suggested by Fisher's "omnibus" procedure for combining one-sided statistical tests <ref> [ Fisher, 1970 ] </ref> . Our results show that the classification accuracy of protein motif queries is highest using the product of p-values as the combined score. Classification accuracy is only slightly lower with the sum of reduced variates method, but the accuracy of the p-value estimate is much worse.

Reference-contexts: The classification accuracy of a score combining function g (s; Q) is the degree to which it separates the true members of the family described by the query from all other sequences in the database being searched. We measure classification accuracy using the ROC 50 metric <ref> [ Gribskov and Robinson, 1996 ] </ref> because it combines measurements of the sensitivity and selectivity of a search method into a single number in a sensible manner [ Swets, 1988 ] .

Reference-contexts: For each motif in the query, we estimate the parameters of this distribution using the sequences in the database being searched. We then transform the GEV random variables into reduced variates, each of which has a Gumbel limiting distribution <ref> [ Kinnison, 1985 ] </ref> . The score combining function for this method is the sum of the reduced variates, T i (s), of each of the motifs, g (s; Q) = i=1 where T i (s) is defined below (Eqn. 11).
