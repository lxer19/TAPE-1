Abstract: Audience interactivity was a primary element of a major planetarium production about cell biology entitled Journey into the Living Cell. The artist/authors were directly involved with the design of the production from concept to realization. Rob Fisher was the Project, Artistic and Technical Director. Paul Vanouse was Assistant Director responsible for the design and production of the interactive visual portions of the show. Roger Dannenberg directed the interactive audio portions and was responsible for the interactive audio system with the assistance of Jeff Christensen. The following paper provides background about the production and our varied perspectives on the use of the innovative interactive system. In addition, a future production currently pending approval of an NSF grant will be described. This new show about the brain builds upon the experiences gained in the cell project and sheds light on features of audience interactivity that point to some startling conclusions about group behavior. Journey Into the Living Cell was an interdisciplinary collaboration utilizing a planetarium for a new type of science education. Journey... was a major collaborative effort involving scientists from Carnegie Mellons Center for Light Microscope Imaging and Biotechnology, artists from the STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, and educators from Pittsburghs Carnegie Science Center. Similar persons and organizations within Pittsburgh and across the nation were also involved as collaborators, advisors and contributors to the immense set of visual imagery used in the production. The show is a forty minute interactive multimedia presentation on Cell Biology incorporating cutting edge technology that created the Group Immersive Visualization Environment (GIVE). The educational aims of the project were to allow large numbers of elementary and secondary school students and nonexperts in the general public to experience interactive simulations of scientific phenomena. Specifically, students were enabled to explore the structure and several functions of the living cell. The cognitive goals of the show included teaching the audience biological principles, most importantly: the dynamic, 3D nature and structure of the cell; the cooperative interaction of its component organelles; and the central dogma of DNA and cellular reproduction. The project challenged audiences to correct misconceptions they may have had about the cell, biology, and the practice of science. A vast challenge for educators and artists alike is the integration of content and form. The planetarium became an analog of the cell, often covered in dense cytoskeletal fibers as if the audience were deep inside the cell. A strategy was developed that allowed for a more participatory
