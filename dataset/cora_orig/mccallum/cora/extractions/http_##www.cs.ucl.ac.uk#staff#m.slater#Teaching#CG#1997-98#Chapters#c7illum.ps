Title: Chapter 7 Local Illumination Models and an Introduction to Ray Tracing  
Date: December, 1997.  
Note: (C) Computer Graphics and Virtual Environments, M. Slater,  7.1 Introduction  
Abstract: Previous chapters have concentrated exclusively on the geometrical and topological aspects of scene description and viewing. We have treated all objects as geometrical entities, and the relationships between objects were considered only from the point of view of their geometric relationship, and within each object we considered the relationship between parameters such as vertices, edges and faces (the topology). In this chapter we consider objects as material entities that reflect light and therefore are perceived as having colour, connecting back to the human perceiver, the other side of the computer graphics equation. In order to do this concentrate in this chapter on the surfaces of objects, rather than as volumes, in other words we continue to consider only boundary representations. The perceptual psychologist, J.J. Gibson pointed out (Gibson, 1986, p16) that a surface is an interface between any two of the three states of matter - solid, liquid and gas, for example, between a medium (the surrounding medium such as air) and a substance (such as metal) comprising the object. He noted (p23): The surface is where most of the action is. The surface is where light is reflected or absorbed, not the interior of the substance. In computer graphics we consider materials to be of one of two abstract types with respect to the way that they reflect light: perfectly diffuse and perfectly specular surfaces. Given a single ray of light aimed at a point on a surface a diffusely reflecting surface scatters light equally in all directions over an illumination hemisphere with the point at the centre of its base. A specularly reflecting surface reflects and (in the case of transparent surfaces, transmits) light only in a narrow beam of small solid angle depending on the angle of incidence of the ray to the surface and the normal of the surface. A perfectly specular surface reflects and transmits light in a single direction instead of a narrow beam. These matters will be taken up in substantial detail in Chapter XXX. Meanwhile, it follows that there are at least four (ideal) mechanisms of light transport between surfaces in an environment, shown in Figure 1. This shows four situations, where there is a surface receiving a light ray and reflecting light that is received by another surface. Generally ray tracing successfully models the situation shown in (a) where all surfaces are perfect specular reflectors (and transmitters) of light. The model known as radiosity successfully models scenes where all surfaces are ideal diffuse reflectors, as shown in (d). Situations shown in (b) and (c) have no general solution, but rather rely on multi-pass methods that combine ray tracing with radiosity. These are issues for Chapter XXX. In this chapter we first consider the basic local illumination model that considers the interaction between a light source and a single surface. This model has been used in computer graphics since the early 1970s. It assumes that light sources are single points, or alternatively specified as direction vectors to sources that are infinitely far away. It is a local model, in the sense that it only deals with interaction between light sources and material surfaces, and does not take into account (except in an approximating manner) the reflection of light between surfaces illustrated in Figure 1. However, shading based on such local illumination models are simple to compute, give acceptable results for simple scenes, and are fast enough for a degree of real-time 3D animation and interaction. Graphics workstations providing hardware support for 3D shading typically use a subset of the models presented here. As a contrast we provide in this chapter an elementary introduction to ray tracing, a global illumination method that attempts to deal with the situation shown Figure 1(a) for multiple specular surfaces. We considered some aspects of the human visual system in Chapter 6, and various methods for the representation and measurement of colour. In this chapter we will show how to compute the intensity of light at a point on a surface. Ideally the intensity should be computed for all wavelengths in the visible spectrum. In practice we assume an RGB colour model and only compute intensities for these primaries. Colour intensities (separately for red, green and blue) range from 0 to a maximum value according to the number of bits reserved for the colour on the graphics workstation. E.g.., if this is 8 bits, for red, then colour intensity is from 0 (no red) to 255 (maximum red). The following discussion assumes that colour intensities are normalised, i.e., are in the real range 0 to 1.
