Abstract: We present an approach to learning complex dependencies among multiple streams of time-series data incrementally. Given a set of input streams that contain categorical values that change over time, we characterize recurring structure with a set of dependency rules that can be used to predict stream values in the future. These rules are general in the sense of ignoring noisy values in streams.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we present the Incremental Multi-stream Dependency Detection (IMSDD) algorithm and describe some of the factors that affect its performance. We compare it with MSDD, a batch algorithm that has been shown to solve multi-stream dependency detection problems quite successfully <ref> [4] </ref>. 2 Definitions Operating in the world of MSDD and IMSDD requires a few definitions and representations to keep the concepts clear. We will adopt the following terminology for the remainder of this paper. * A stream is a source of categorical data values that change over time. <p> The second result implies that due to the larger stream size, there is some degree of difficulty learning good initial generalizations given the added dimensions in search space size. While these results were encouraging, it remained to test IMSDD against its tried and true predecessor MSDD <ref> [4] </ref>. Using identical data, we ran the 5 stream dataset through MSDD, varying the size of its training batch, to see how IMSDD compared. Examination of the ahr curve showed that MSDD was quicker to account for 100% of the present structure, but that IMSDD was not far behind.
