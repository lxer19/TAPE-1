Title: Abstract  
Abstract: A 13-bit 5-MHz pipelined analog to digital converter (ADC) was designed with the goal of minimizing power dissipation. Power was reduced by using a high swing residue amplifier architecture and by optimizing the per stage resolution. The prototype device fabricated in a 1.2 m CMOS process displayed 80.1 dB peak SNDR and 82.9 dB dynamic range. INL is 0.8 LSB and DNL is 0.3 LSB for a 100kHz input. The circuit dissipates 166mW on a 5V supply.

Reference-contexts: The pipelined architecture is well suited to these applications [1][2][3]<ref> [4] </ref>, because through the use of a combination of digital correction, self-calibration, and optimum tapering of sampling capacitor value, it can realize a very low power dissipation. The application of these concepts at the 10-bit level was recently demonstrated [4]. This paper describes the application of low-power pipeline design techniques to high-resolution pipeline ADCs, where power dissipation is completely dominated by the necessity of driving the large required sampling capacitors. <p> It has been demonstrated in recent work that power associated with quantization in comparators can be made small compared to sampling power through the use of digital correction <ref> [4] </ref>. As a result the most important goal for power minimization in pipelines is the reduction of the S/H capacitance values to their kT/C limited values.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, calibration is necessary when high resolution is required. 3. Power minimization in Pipeline ADCs Dynamic range in a pipelined ADC is degraded by thermal noise from the sampling switches and residue amplifiers. The noise power is inversely proportional to the size of the sampling capacitor C S <ref> [5] </ref>, and signal power is proportional to the square of the maximum signal swing. Often, the maximum signal swing is nearly equal to the supply voltage V DD . If this is the case, the signal to noise ratio is approximately proportional to .

Reference-contexts: If this is the case, the signal to noise ratio is approximately proportional to . The minimum power required to charge the sampling capacitors from ground to V DD and back to ground at a frequency equal to the sample rate f s is <ref> [6] </ref>. This represents the minimum power dissipation achievable and is seen to be proportional to the product of the signal to noise ratio and the sampling rate.

Reference-contexts: timing alignment is still required to minimize the amount of voltage range that must be allowed for in the digital correction system. 3.3 High-swing Operational Amplifier Simple one-stage folded cascode and telescopic r amplifiers have been widely used in high-speed CMOS applications, achieving reasonable gain through extensive use of cascoding <ref> [8] </ref>. The simplicity is an advantage in terms of speed and power dissipation. However, the need for cascode transistors to achieve adequate gain reduces the available signal swing from the supply.
