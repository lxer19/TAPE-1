Abstract: Our approach for the Robocup97 competition is to emphasize teamwork among agents by augmenting reactions (based on awareness of the current situation) with predictions (based on predefined multi-agent maneuvers). These predictions are accomplished by allowing agents to cooperatively accomplish predefined plans, which are elaborated reactively and hierarchically to ensure responsiveness to changing circumstances. By supporting the run-time construction of plans, our approach simplifies the introduction of new plans, strategies, and actions, and produces a framework for dynamic adaptation and plan recognition through automatically generating belief networks. Our implementation is built on top of UM-PRS, a procedural reasoning system architecture for real-time environments, which allows specifying, executing, and integrating plans based on subgoaling and preconditions. However, as RoboCup competitors are endowed with a full repertoire of reactive behaviors, it is likely that what will set teams apart will be the added capabilities they bring to the table. Our hypothesis that while being aware of and acting appropriately for the current situation is the most critical capability for an agent, an agent that is able to behave proactively will have an edge, because it is aware of the situation that is about to unfold as well as what has already unfolded. Anticipating (partial) future situations can be done when agents on a team can associate themselves with roles in particular team plans (predefined and/or scripted plays), since an agent in such a plan knows what others will be trying to do. There are many sources of such plays when it comes to soccer. The rich knowledge of formations, plays, and strategies would appear to be important to tap into, and thus our agent design strategy has prefered an implementation that allows us to encode this knowledge directly, rather than by using learning mechanisms to get the agents to learn this knowledge inductively. Also, as new strategies are concocted or discovered, the agents architecture should allow these to be easily and effortlessly incorporated with the preexisting strategies. Competitors for our team are likely to pursue particular team strategies of varying degrees of complexity, whether these are represented explicitly or captured implicitly in the configuration of the reactive agent behaviors. To the degree to which we can represent such strategies, our agents should be able to use these explicit models to construct evidential reasoning networks that support plan recognition. Again, our assumption is that all agents will be able to react to the current situation; agents that can predict likely emerging situations by anticipating their opponents moves will have an edge. Finally, as strategies, methods, and plays are added to an agent, the agent itself should be able to select the most appropriate plan for its current/predicted situation, and when more than one applies equally to the situation, the agent should dynamically learn which seems to be the most successful in the current game. In this manner, an agent team can adapt to its opponents strategy, strengths, and weaknesses. From these assumptions, we are building a real-time multi-agent system that satisfies the following requirements: 1. The agents can follow simple reactive

Reference-contexts: Opponent modeling Plan Recognition Yet another advantage of using UMPRS as a real-time architecture for Robocup is that UMPRS itself can be extended to automatically generate bayesian networks for plan recognition <ref> [Huber 96] </ref> of any given agent (using observations and the assumption that every agent can be modeled with a similar set of methods, actions, and plans), which can allow for both improved agent collaboration and ability to model and predict the goals and actions of opponents.
