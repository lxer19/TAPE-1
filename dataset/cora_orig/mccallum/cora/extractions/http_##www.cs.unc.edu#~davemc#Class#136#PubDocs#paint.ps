[1978] Alvy Ray Smith publishes first documentation of Paint, BigPaint, and (briefly) Paint3 , plus history of digital painting up until then, as tutorial notes for SIGGRAPH 78 [Smith78]. <p> This was in 1977. The principal system engineer at NIH with whom he worked was Tom Porter, who was probably seeing his first paint program. The proximity of JPL to Hollywood made Jims lab probably the first exposure of many film people to digital imaging technology <ref> [Blinn97] </ref>. The Quantel stream had no influence on the mainstream above. It is not clear if it was influenced by the NYIT developments. <p> It is not clear if it was influenced by the NYIT developments.

Reference-contexts: In 1978 he added tablet control to this to get painting, which inherited 8-bit or 24-bit mode, antialiasing, airbrushing, etc from the Copy program.

[1977] Alvy Ray Smith implements first full-color 24-bit (RGB) paint system Paint3 at the New York Institute of Technology, for three Evans & Sutherland or Genisco framebuffers in parallel [Smith78]. [1977-78] Jim Blinn adapts Bloomenthals paint program to his needs at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. <p> in 1977 he adds airbrushing that is later used to generate texture maps for his Voyager flyby simulation movies in 1978 [Blinn97]. [1978] Alvy Ray Smith publishes first documentation of Paint, BigPaint, and (briefly) Paint3 , plus history of digital painting up until then, as tutorial notes for SIGGRAPH 78 <ref> [Smith78] </ref>. These notes plus [Smith79a] are used for several years at successive SIGGRAPH conference tutorials. [1978] Marc Levoy implements a specialized 8-bit program for painting (opaquing) animation cels, OPAQUE . <p> Both Garland and Jim recall that the two programs were separate developments [Blinn97, Stern97]. Digital Paint SystemHistorical Overview Alvy Ray Smith 8 attended tutorials by NYIT personnel, and acknowledge having my paper <ref> [Smith78] </ref>, but legal precedence matters have obfuscated this part of the history. I dont know of any connection between the Digital Effects paint program and the mainstream. One definite side stream to the main lineage above is of course the Aurora Imaging system Aurora/100 . <p> I used the system to create my first digital animation videotape, Vidbits , in 1974. Alvy Ray Smith: Paint and Paint3 Paint (and its high-resolution extension, BigPaint ) is clearly described in <ref> [Smith78] </ref>. Of more pertinence here is the full-color, 24-bit version, Paint3 , that was only briefly described in Appendix B of [Smith78]. It was the first paint system to have 16.7 million colors. This permitted airbrushing and full compositing of any image over any other, and these were both implemented. <p> Alvy Ray Smith: Paint and Paint3 Paint (and its high-resolution extension, BigPaint ) is clearly described in <ref> [Smith78] </ref>.

[1978] Marc Levoy implements a specialized 8-bit program for painting (opaquing) animation cels, OPAQUE . <p> In 1978 he added tablet control to this to get painting, which inherited 8-bit or 24-bit mode, antialiasing, airbrushing, etc from the Copy program. In 1978-79 he fleshed this on out into his ept painting system [Cohen97] 23 I had also noted this. See <ref> [Smith79a] </ref>. Dick Shoup based his Aurora products on this concept too [Shoup97].

Reference-contexts: I include a little information about major developments in the later 1980s. Two surveys that cover this later period fairly wellwhen the emergence of the personal computer completely changed the software universewere both published in the magazine Computer Graphics World <ref> [Smith82a, Robertson88] </ref>. My emphasis, of course, is on those systems I knew firsthand. I begin with a simple timeline of programs and systems.

The movie opened in June of 1982. See <ref> [Smith82b] </ref> for details of the production, including reference to Toms system. This was the first use of digital paint systems for movie production at Lucasfilm. I believe it was also the first use of them in theatrical release motion pictures.
