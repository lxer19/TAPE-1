Reference-contexts: Very expressive versions of such languages have been developed <ref> [Bac90, Hal90] </ref>. In Halpern's [Hal90] language, e.g., we can write "Pr (C) = 0:9" to represent that the degree of certainty, or degree of belief, in "C" is 0.9.

Reference-contexts: This is correct, but it ignores the main point: the choice of a prior distribution is not deductive! For example, in <ref> [BGHK92a] </ref>, we present an approach for assigning probabilistic degrees of belief to conclusions using a knowledge base of statistical information. The approach is based on Laplace's principle of indifference [Lap20]. There are different realizations of the approach each of which generates a different prior distribution on our beliefs. <p> Although we can certainly provide good motivation for each of these choices of prior, none is a logical consequence of the knowledge we have. Since the choice of prior is not deductive in <ref> [BGHK92a] </ref>, neither are the conclusions that we draw. <p> A great deal of machinery has been introduced in the literature in an attempt to extend the reference class approach to more complex cases. However, it is not clear that this machinery is actually required to solve the original problem. In recent work <ref> [BGHK92a] </ref> we have investigated an alternate approach to assigning probabilities to conclusions. Like Kyburg our approach assigns probabilistic degrees of belief to conclusions using a knowledge base of statistical information.

Reference-contexts: However, the formal characterization is quite different. For example, our approach deals well with certain variants of the lottery paradox, and the conclusions it generates appear to have a far cleaner characterization than those generated by Kyburg's suggested acceptance rule. We have explored this approach in detail in <ref> [BGHK92b] </ref>. This approach also demonstrates once again that Schema 1 and 2 are not necessarily distinct approaches.

Reference-contexts: Schema 2, on the other hand, requires no such representational power. Here we bury the inferential uncertainty in the inference procedure, and the final conclusion "C" is not tagged by its uncertainty. Such an approach is typical of work on non-monotonic logic (see, e.g., <ref> [Gin87] </ref>). Do these schema really represent fundamentally distinct approaches to the problem? We believe that the distinction is not sharp. In some cases it reduces simply to a matter of representation.

Reference-contexts: This approach is related to, but not coincident with, Geffner and Pearl's *-semantics <ref> [GP90] </ref>. Here the focus has shifted, instead of ignoring the "hedge" in our conclusions we ignore the "hedge" in our premises.

Reference-contexts: Very expressive versions of such languages have been developed <ref> [Bac90, Hal90] </ref>.

What is important here is that the probabilities, or the hedges, are represented inside of the language, i.e., they are not meta-linguistic constructs.

Reference-contexts: Third, the approach is subject to ad hoc restrictions. For example, disjunctive reference classes (such as the reference class consisting of the union of Quakers and Republicans) are not allowed <ref> [Kyb83] </ref>. Hence, if we possess statistical information about a disjunctive class we cannot use it. Fourth, note that the original problem|computing probabilities based on one's knowledge|makes no mention of the notion of reference class.

Reference-contexts: The notion of finding "the right" class simply does not apply here. Second, the rules used to choose between reference classes are ad hoc. Their only justification is that they seem to work in various examples; however, there are well-known examples <ref> [Lev80] </ref> where the answers they give seem quite unreasonable. Third, the approach is subject to ad hoc restrictions. For example, disjunctive reference classes (such as the reference class consisting of the union of Quakers and Republicans) are not allowed [Kyb83].

Reference-contexts: So if John is a college professor and 0.1% of college professors die every year we would assign a probability of 0.001 to "John will die in the next year." The notion of reference class, due originally to Reichenbach <ref> [Rei49] </ref>, has the advantage of yielding intuitive results in simple cases, but unfortunately it is highly problematic as a foundation for a general theory. 4 The problem lies in what Kyburg briefly refers to as the "indefinitely large set of possible reference classes." He refers to three principles for choosing among
