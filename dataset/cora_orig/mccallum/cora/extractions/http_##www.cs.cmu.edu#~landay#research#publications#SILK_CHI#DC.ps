Abstract: Current interactive user interface construction tools are often more of a hindrance than a benefit during the early stages of interface design. These tools take too much time to use and force designers to specify more of the design details than they wish at this stage. Most designers prefer to sketch early interface ideas on paper. I am developing an interactive tool called SILK that allows designers to quickly sketch an interface using an electronic pad and stylus. SILK preserves the important properties of pencil and paper: a rough drawing can be produced very quickly and the medium is very flexible. However, unlike a paper sketch, this electronic sketch can easily be edited, exercised, and semiautomatically transformed into a complete, operational interface in a specified look-and-feel. Much of the design literature recommends drawing rough sketches of design ideas [1], yet most interface construction tools, such as the NeXT Interface Builder, and even prototyping tools, like HyperCard, require the designer to specify much more of the design than a rough sketch allows. These tools force designers to bridge the gap between how they think about a design and the detailed specification they must create to allow the tool to reflect a specialization of that design. Another key lesson from the design literature is the value of iterative design. It is important to iterate quickly in the early stages of design because that is when radically different ideas can and should be examined. The need to turn out new designs quickly is hampered by tools that require detailed designs. This over-specification can be tedious and may also lead to a loss of spontaneity. Thus, the designer may be forced to abandon computerized tools until later in the design process or forced to change design techniques in a way that is not conducive to early creative design. Additionally, research indicates that the use of current interactive tools in the early stages of development places too much focus on design details like color and alignment rather than on the major interface design issues, such as structure and behavior [5]. Wong found that colleagues give more useful feedback when evaluating interfaces with a sketchy look. I surveyed sixteen professional designers from around the world concerning their use of tools in interface design. These designers reported that current user interface construction tools are a hindrance during the early stages of interface design. What designers need are computerized tools that allow them to quickly sketch rough design ideas [4]. INTERACTIVE SKETCHING I am developing an interactive tool called SILK [2] that allows designers to quickly sketch an interface using an electronic stylus. SILK then retains the sketchy look of the components. The system facilitates rapid prototyping of interface ideas through the use of gestures for sketch creation. Unlike a paper sketch, the electronic sketch allows the designer or test subjects to exercise the sketch before it becomes a finished interface by manipulating it with the mouse, keyboard, or stylus. For example, in Figure 1, the user can drag the sketched scrollbar elevator up and down.
