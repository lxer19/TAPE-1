Abstract: Unlike most Artificial Life studies, we use biological data to verify a hypothesis about control mechanisms. We recorded male cricket Gryllus bimaculatus calling song, built a robot with the hypothesised control mechanism for phonotaxis behaviour and verified that it could account for the behaviour by observing the robot doing phono-taxis to the real cricket song. Further, we present a set of robot experiments that show how frequency dependence of the ear directionality in crickets can account for frequency selectivity in phonotaxis. Further, the results suggest that this mechanism also might account for part of the female choice behaviour.

Reference-contexts: The rate of tripping of the teeth of the file is determined by the resonant properties of the harp, a specialised area on the wing that radiates the sound. This produces a pure and fairly constant carrier frequency <ref> [1] </ref>. It has been argued that these relatively low frequencies are advantageous for the propagation of sound over long distances, especially through vegetation which acts as a low-pass filter. However low frequency sounds pose difficulties for receptor directionality, particularly for small animals such as crickets.

Reference-contexts: If the cricket cannot detect a difference between its ears it may not respond phonotactically even though the sound is `audible'. For example Boyd and Lewis <ref> [2] </ref> report that "an appreciable L-R difference was usually evident between about 4-6kHz but differences of more than 10dB were restricted to frequencies within a band of some 300Hz either side of the best frequency" (p.530).

Reference-contexts: A principal goal has been to use these experiments to underline the new paradigm that states that we have to study both "life as we know it" and "life as it could be" in order to obtain a general theory about life <ref> [5] </ref>. However, the distinction between "life as we know it" and "life as it could be" has resulted in nearly all Artificial Life researchers studying the latter, because this is what distinguishes the new paradigm from more traditional approaches toward the understanding of life.

Reference-contexts: The actual frequency varies with species from about 2 to 8 kHz. The most commonly studied species for phonotaxis experiments have carrier frequencies between 4.5kHz and 5.5kHz; Gryllus bimacu-latus has a typical carrier of 4.7-4.8kHz. Individuals may vary by +/- 100Hz. However as Popov and Shuvalov <ref> [11] </ref> noted "it cannot be used as a basic [i.e. single] cue for recognition [of conspecifics] ...because, in most cases studied, the spectra of the CSs of sympatric species of crickets often overlap to a degree that cannot be resolved by their auditory system" (p. 114). <p> Most commonly reported is the threshold intensity required to drive a phonotaxis response. Thus Popov and Shuvalov <ref> [11] </ref> reported that G. bimaculatus tested in a Y-maze reacted to 4.5kHz songs at 10dB lower intensity than 3 or 7kHz tones and no positive taxis occurred above 12kHz. <p> The experiments show that frequency dependence of the ear dir-ectionality alone can contribute to frequency selectivity in phonotaxis, and the obtained results are comparable with the behavioural studies on crickets.

Reference-contexts: Thus we can examine how the hypothesised control mechanism, implemented on the robot, can account for the animal's behaviour. Previously, we used a LEGO robot to show how a simple control mechanism could account for phonotaxis behaviour in crickets <ref> [17] </ref>. That is, the ability of a female cricket to locate the calling song of a male was reproduced. In particular the robot showed "preference" for certain songs in a manner that matched the female cricket, but using a much simpler decision mechanism than had previously been thought necessary. <p> The opposite happens if the robot is turned another 180 degrees, so that the right microphone is closer to the sound source (figure 3 (3)). In our hypothesised control mechanism, the output from the circuit is fed into a comparator mechanism similar to that described in <ref> [17] </ref>. That is, for each side the output is fed into a leaky integrator, and whichever side reaches threshold first causes a small turn to be made in that direction.
