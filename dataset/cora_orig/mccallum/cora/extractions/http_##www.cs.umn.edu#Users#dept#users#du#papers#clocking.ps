Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of determining a valid clock setting for a combinational circuit. The performance of a circuit depends on its clock period. The shorter a valid clock period is, the better the performance is. We first consider the cases in which the primary input and output latches are triggered by the same clock signal but different phases. We have proposed two new bounds for clock period by considering a type of paths called functionally sensitizable paths. Then these results are extended to wavepipelined circuits. We have compared the new bounds with the previously proposed bounds and it has been shown that these new bounds may have better performance for certain combinational circuits. We have also given an example to show that the path delays obtained by two-vector model may not be valid when used for clock setting. The bounds on clock period can alternatively be viewed as optimization objectives. We present some experimental results to show various bounds on clock period for ISCAS benchmark circuits and discuss the potential complexity of optimizing circuits with these bounds.

Reference-contexts: Very often, there will also be an additional constrain on the latency LT. In general, there are three approaches to improve the performance of a circuit, depending on the level where the enhancement occurs <ref> [5] </ref>. We focus on optimization at the physical level. The amount of effort required to improve the performance is proportional to the number of long paths needed to be shortened and the number of the short pathes needed to be lengthened.

Reference-contexts: It is possible to obtain a shorter clock period by considering both the topological longest and shortest delays (i.e., use the difference of the two). This technique is known as maximum-rate pipelining. However, as indicated in <ref> [1-3, 8, 13, 15, 17] </ref>, the delay of the longest topological path may be a poor estimate of the actual long delay of a circuit. Therefore, several path sensitization criteria and algorithms have been proposed to determine the longest sensitizable path.

Reference-contexts: Since the longest two-vector delay may be shorter (at least no longer) than the longest one-vector delay, the two-vector delays are usually considered as more accurate but harder to obtain. The concept of the shortest destabilizing path was proposed in <ref> [18] </ref>. The clock period can be either the difference of the longest one-vector delay and the shortest topological delay or the difference of the longest topological delay and the shortest destabilizing path delay. In this paper we present two tighter bounds on the clock period than the ones used in [18]. <p> <ref> [18] </ref>. The clock period can be either the difference of the longest one-vector delay and the shortest topological delay or the difference of the longest topological delay and the shortest destabilizing path delay. In this paper we present two tighter bounds on the clock period than the ones used in [18]. The bounds on valid clocking are based on a different concept called functional sensitizable paths. We have also extended the results to wavepipelined circuits. <p> We shall show an example by defining the destabilizing path based on the loose path sensitization criterion proposed in <ref> [18] </ref>. Given a path p=(G 0 ; f 0 ; G 1 ; f 1 ; :::; f m1 ; G m ), P is described as destabilizing if for each input f i of G i+1 , one of the following holds: 1. <p> An algorithm to find the delay of the shortest destabilizing path is described in [14]. Two better estimates of C p , namely, L fl - S + t c and L - S fl + t c were proposed in <ref> [18] </ref>. An example was also provided to show that L fl - S fl + t c is not valid in [18]. <p> Two better estimates of C p , namely, L fl - S + t c and L - S fl + t c were proposed in <ref> [18] </ref>. An example was also provided to show that L fl - S fl + t c is not valid in [18]. In this paper, we present two other estimates of C p by using a combination of longest sensitizable path, shortest destabilizing path, and a new types of sensitizable paths called functional sensitizable paths. In the following, we define the functional sensitizable paths. <p> The latency is L flfl +t s . 2 These results can also be extended to the circuits with feedbacks as in <ref> [18] </ref>. We intend to use the circuit shown in Figure 3 to show the difference of various sensi-tizable paths which we have considered. In Figure 3, the number on a lead represents the delay of the lead. <p> The length of the shortest topological path the length of the shortest functional sensitizable path the length of the shortest destabilizing path. Three possible valid clock settings for C p are discussed in <ref> [18] </ref>. (1) The difference between the length of the longest topological path and the length of the shortest topological path: 2000 - 50 + t c = 1950 + t c . (2) The difference between the length of the longest sensitizable path and the length of the shortest topological path: <p> This bound improves the bound (2) in <ref> [18] </ref> for this circuit. (b) The difference between the delay of longest functional sensitizable path and the delay of the shortest destabilizing path is: 1000 - 600 + t c = 400 + t c . This bound improves the bound (3) in [18] for this circuit. <p> This bound improves the bound (2) in <ref> [18] </ref> for this circuit. (b) The difference between the delay of longest functional sensitizable path and the delay of the shortest destabilizing path is: 1000 - 600 + t c = 400 + t c . This bound improves the bound (3) in [18] for this circuit. In the following, we will give an example to show that two vector delay may not be used for valid clocking. The number on each lead of the circuit shown in Figure 4 represents the delay of the lead. <p> Even though theoretically our two bounds improve the two corresponding bounds proposed in <ref> [18] </ref> respectively, our experimental results did not show any improvement. <p> There are more long paths (gates covered by long paths) than long functional sensitizable paths for the circuit C432, so if we use the longest functional sensitizable path and the shortest destabilizing path instead of the longest path and the shortest destabilizing path in <ref> [18] </ref> for C432, the optimization problem may become easier. In order to achieve the C P , some paths which are shorter than LT-C p may need to be lengthened while the delays of gates on these paths may need to be increased. <p> We observe that there are more short paths than short functional sensitizable paths for the circuits C432, C1908, C2670, C3540 and C5315. If we use the longest sensitizable path and the shortest functional sensitizable path instead of the longest sensitizable path and the shortest topological path in <ref> [18] </ref>, the optimization problem may become easier. <p> path and the shortest functional path may make the optimization problem easiest among these five clock bounds. 5 Conclusion By using the longest and shortest functional sensitizable path with the longest sensitizable path and the shortest destabilizing path, we obtain two clock periods which improve those clock periods proposed in <ref> [18] </ref>. These results are extended to the wavepipelined circuits and two new clock periods are obtained. These clock periods on wavepipelined circuits may be more accurate than those proposed by [19], [20] for certain circuits.
