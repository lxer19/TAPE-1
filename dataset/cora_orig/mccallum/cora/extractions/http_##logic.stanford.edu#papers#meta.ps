Reference-contexts: Elkan also makes this observation in <ref> [Elkan,1990] </ref>. It is a base-level fact the frame axiom that justifies our confidence in this domain-independent control rule. 3 The frame axiom justifies our belief that we will be able to achieve the subgoals separately, and therefore that planning for them separately is a computa-tionally useful strategy. <p> In many cases, doing so may involve extending the declarative language being used to include information that is probabilistic [Smith,1986, Smith and Genesereth,1985, Smith et al.,1986] or default <ref> [Elkan,1990, Ginsberg,1991] </ref> in nature; this can be expected to lead to still further interesting research questions. Domain-dependent information The recognition that the domain-dependent information used by a declarative system is all base-level or modal has interesting implications in its own right.

Reference-contexts: Nowhere do we see the use of a control rule whose justification is so obscure that it is inaccessible to the system using it. The results in <ref> [Etzioni,1990] </ref> also lend credence to this belief. Etzioni's static system showed that determining whether or not a rule learned by prodigy 4 As Smith himself has pointed out (personal communication). was likely to be useful in practice could be deter-mined by a static examination of the prodigy search space.

Reference-contexts: Thus Elkan's principle is in fact a special case of the approach that we are proposing; this observation is made in <ref> [Ginsberg,1991] </ref> as well, where it is suggested that the true role of nonmonoton-ic reasoning in AI generally is to enable us to simplify problems in this way. The reason that we plan for the airplane flight before planning for the other two subgoals is similar. <p> In many cases, doing so may involve extending the declarative language being used to include information that is probabilistic [Smith,1986, Smith and Genesereth,1985, Smith et al.,1986] or default <ref> [Elkan,1990, Ginsberg,1991] </ref> in nature; this can be expected to lead to still further interesting research questions.

Reference-contexts: An example due to Minton and appearing in <ref> [Minton et al.,1989] </ref> can be handled similarly. This example is from the blocks world, where Minton suggests that when planning to build a tower, expect to build it from the bottom up.

Reference-contexts: This reexamination is, of course, the "metametalevel" analysis that we are trying to avoid. Research on control of inference There has been little work to date on domain-independent techniques for the control of search. Smith investigates the question in a declarative setting in <ref> [Smith,1986, Smith and Genesereth,1985, Smith et al.,1986] </ref>, while authors concerned with constraint satisfaction have considered these issues from a somewhat different viewpoint [Dechter,1990, Dechter and Meiri,1989, Dechter and Pearl,1988, Ginsberg et al.,1990, and others]. The ideas in this paper suggest an obvious way in which these results can be extended. <p> If the existing domain-dependent control information used by various systems does in fact rest on general domain-independent principles, these general principles should be extracted and made explicit. In many cases, doing so may involve extending the declarative language being used to include information that is probabilistic <ref> [Smith,1986, Smith and Genesereth,1985, Smith et al.,1986] </ref> or default [Elkan,1990, Ginsberg,1991] in nature; this can be expected to lead to still further interesting research questions.
