Reference-contexts: A partial solution to information overload is to give people timely and filtered information, most relevant to the them at their present time <ref> [Maes94] </ref>. Such information should be represented in a concise and consistent manner such that it does not require much cognitive load. Current applications such as email readers present all messages sequentially and do not provide an easy way of glancing the information space or filtering important messages.

Reference-contexts: CLUES is a filtering and prioritization system developed by Matt Marx at the Media Lab <ref> [Marx96] </ref>. It detects the timely nature of email messages by finding correlation between a users calendar, rolodex, to-do list, as well as a record of outgoing messages and phone calls.
