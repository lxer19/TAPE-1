Abstract: We show that simultaneous rigid E-unification, or SREU for short, is decidable and in fact EXPTIME-complete in the case of one variable. This result implies that the 8 fl 98 fl fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is decidable. Together with a previous result regarding the undecidability of the 99-fragment, we obtain a complete classification of decidability of the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality, in terms of the quantifier prefix. It is also proved that SREU with one variable and a constant bound on the number of rigid equations is P complete.

It was shown recently in Degtyarev and Voronkov [11] that SREU is undecidable.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, S (x) is solvable iff T n i=1 T (A i ) is nonempty. The lemma follows, since DTAI is in EXPTIME. ut Remark Decidability of SREU with one variable can also be proved by combining Lemma 4 with a result by Brainerd <ref> [3] </ref> that states that, given a set R of a ground rewrite rules and a set T of ground terms, then the set f t j (9s 2 T ) t fl recognizable.

Reference-contexts: With two variables, SREU is undecidable already with three rigid equations [24]. 2 Preliminaries We will first establish some notation and terminology. We follow Chang and Keisler <ref> [4] </ref> regarding first order languages and structures. For the purposes of this paper it is enough to assume that the first order languages that we are dealing with are languages with equality and contain only function symbols and constants, so we will assume that from here on.

Reference-contexts: We write Terms (E) for the set of all terms that occur in E, in particular Terms (E) is closed under the subterm relation. We will use the following lemma. Lemma 1 follows also from a more general statement in de Kogel <ref> [8, Theorem 5.11] </ref>. Lemma 1. Let t be a ground term, c a constant, E a finite set of ground equations and e a ground equation. Let T = Terms (E [ feg). <p> This establishes the inclusion of SREU with one variable in EXPTIME. We then show that DTAI reduces to SREU with one variable, which shows the hardness part. The construction that we will use is in fact based on a construction in de Kogel <ref> [8, Theorems 4.1 and 4.2] </ref> that is based on Shostak's congruence closure algorithm [37]. 1 A similar construction is used also in Gurevich and Voronkov [25]. 4.1 SREU with one variable is in EXPTIME In the following we will assume that none of the rigid equations are redundant. <p> Then 1.

(See [9].) ut We prove now that SREU with one variable is in EXPTIME. Lemma 8. SREU with one variable is in EXPTIME. Proof. Let S (x) = f S i (x) j 1 i n g be a system of rigid equations.

The strong connections between SREU and intuitionistic logic with equality have led to new important decidability results in the latter area [12,44].

Reference-contexts: SREU with one variable is decidable, in fact EXPTIME-complete. This result is obtained by a polynomial time reduction of SREU with one variable to the intersection nonemptiness problem of finite tree automata. The latter problem is EXPTIME-complete [41]. By using an analogue of a Skolemization result for intuitionistic logic <ref> [12] </ref> we can deduce the following result. The 8 fl 98 fl -fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is decidable. The above results imply the following main contribution of this paper. <p> We can note that, in general, the decidability of monadic SREU is still an open problem. There is also a very close connection between monadic SREU and the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality restricted to function symbols of arity 1 <ref> [12] </ref>. 2 The book of Greenlaw, Hoover and Ruzzo [23] includes an excellent up-to-date survey of around 150 P-complete problems, including generability. 5 Implications to the Prenex Fragment of Intuitionistic Logic The prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic is the collection of all intuitionisti-cally provable prenex formulas. <p> Some of these results are: 1. Decidability, and in particular PSPACE-completeness, of the prenex frag ment of intuitionistic logic without equality [43]. 2. Prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality but without function symbols is PSPACE-complete <ref> [12] </ref>. Decidability of this fragment was proved in Orevkov [35]. 3. Prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality in the language with one unary function symbol is decidable [12]. 4. 9 fl -fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is undecidable [13,14]. <p> Prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality but without function symbols is PSPACE-complete <ref> [12] </ref>. Decidability of this fragment was proved in Orevkov [35]. 3. Prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality in the language with one unary function symbol is decidable [12]. 4. 9 fl -fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is undecidable [13,14]. In some of the above results, the corresponding result has first been obtained for a fragment of SREU with similar restrictions. For example, the proof of the last statement is based on the undecidability of SREU. <p> Theorem 13. The 8 fl 98 fl -fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is decidable and EXPTIME-hard. Proof. Intuitionistic provability of any formula in the 8 fl 98 fl -fragment can be reduced to solvability of SREU with one variable <ref> [12] </ref>. Conversely, solvability of a system of rigid equations with one variable reduces trivially to provability of a corresponding formula in the 9-fragment [12]. The statement follows by Theorem 11. ut Remark The undecidability of the 99-fragment holds if there is one binary function symbol in the signature. <p> Proof. Intuitionistic provability of any formula in the 8 fl 98 fl -fragment can be reduced to solvability of SREU with one variable <ref> [12] </ref>.

The nonemptiness problem of DTAs is basically the problem of generability of finitely presented algebras. The latter problem is P-complete <ref> [27] </ref> and thus, by a very simple reduction, also the former problem [41]. 2 For bounded SREU with one variable we get the following result. Theorem 12. Bounded SREU with one variable is P-complete. Proof. Let the number of rigid equtions be bounded by some fixed positive integer n.

The strong connections between SREU and intuitionistic logic with equality have led to new important decidability results in the latter area [12,44].

Reference-contexts: We then show that DTAI reduces to SREU with one variable, which shows the hardness part. The construction that we will use is in fact based on a construction in de Kogel [8, Theorems 4.1 and 4.2] that is based on Shostak's congruence closure algorithm <ref> [37] </ref>. 1 A similar construction is used also in Gurevich and Voronkov [25]. 4.1 SREU with one variable is in EXPTIME In the following we will assume that none of the rigid equations are redundant.

Reference-contexts: We prove the following. SREU with one variable is decidable, in fact EXPTIME-complete. This result is obtained by a polynomial time reduction of SREU with one variable to the intersection nonemptiness problem of finite tree automata. The latter problem is EXPTIME-complete <ref> [41] </ref>. By using an analogue of a Skolemization result for intuitionistic logic [12] we can deduce the following result. The 8 fl 98 fl -fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is decidable. The above results imply the following main contribution of this paper. <p> I The intersection nonemptiness problem of DTAs or DTAI is the following de- cision problem. Given a collection f A i j 1 i n g of DTAs, is T n nonempty? The following result has been observed by other authors [18,22,36] and strictly proved in Veanes <ref> [41] </ref>. Theorem 6 (Veanes). DTAI is EXPTIME-complete. We will first show that SREU with one variable reduces to DTAI in polynomial time. This establishes the inclusion of SREU with one variable in EXPTIME. We then show that DTAI reduces to SREU with one variable, which shows the hardness part. <p> Given a TA A, is T (A) nonempty? The nonemptiness problem of DTAs is basically the problem of generability of finitely presented algebras. The latter problem is P-complete [27] and thus, by a very simple reduction, also the former problem <ref> [41] </ref>. 2 For bounded SREU with one variable we get the following result. Theorem 12. Bounded SREU with one variable is P-complete. Proof. Let the number of rigid equtions be bounded by some fixed positive integer n. P-hardness follows immediately from Theorem 5.

Reference-contexts: The strong connections between SREU and intuitionistic logic with equality have led to new important decidability results in the latter area [12,44]. It follows, for example, that the 9 fl -fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is undecidable [13,14]. This result is improved in Veanes <ref> [42] </ref> to the following. <p> In some of the above results, the corresponding result has first been obtained for a fragment of SREU with similar restrictions. For example, the proof of the last statement is based on the undecidability of SREU. The undecidability of the 9 fl -fragment is improved in Veanes <ref> [42] </ref> where it is proved that, already the 5. 99-fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is undecidable. With the following result we obtain a complete characterization of decidability of the prenex fragment of intutionistic logic with equality with respect to quantifier prefix. Theorem 13.
