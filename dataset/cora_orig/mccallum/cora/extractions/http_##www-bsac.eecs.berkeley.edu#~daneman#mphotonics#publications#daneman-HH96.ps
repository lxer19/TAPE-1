Abstract: We present a linear vibromotor-driven micromachined microreflector designed for integrated microphotonic applications. This device has two degrees of freedom, with an angular travel range of over 90 and a translational travel range of 60 m m. The precision and speed of the microreflector are characterized, and its application to beam steering and fiber coupling systems is demonstrated.

Reference-contexts: Once the slider is in position, it is kept in place by static friction until further actuation. Similar structures were previously subjected to shock and vibration tests and showed no detectable slider motion at forces up to 500 Gs <ref> [1] </ref>. FABRICATION The actuated microreflector was fabricated on a silicon substrate using silicon-surface micromachining technology. The fabrication process is described in detail in [ 1,8]. An n+ polysilicon layer defines a ground plane. Three additional polysilicon structural layers are used to define the comb-drives, sliders, hinges, and mirror beams. <p> However, for external cavity laser applications a higher angular precision is necessary. Since in earlier experiments a microreflector with no on-chip actuators and an alternate hub design has shown a vertical precision of 0.17 m m <ref> [ 1] </ref>, improving the design of the actuated slider should greatly improve the mirror precision. In order to observe the actuation dynamics of the microreflector, a reflected HeNe beam was imaged on a positionsensitive detector while the angular position of the mirror was swept in real time.

Reference-contexts: DESIGN The actuated microreflector ( Figure 1 a) was designed for laser-to-fiber coupling and external-cavity-laser applications. It consists of a polysilicon mirror plate hinged to a support beam. Each of these is, in turn, hinged to a vibromotor-actuated slider. Microhinge technology <ref> [ 3] </ref> allows the joints to rotate out of the plane of the substrate to achieve large aspect ratios. Common-mode actuation of the sliders results in translational motion, while differential slider motion produces out-of-plane mirror rotation. These motions permit the microreflector to position an optical beam in two dimensions.

Reference-contexts: A special pre-release etch in 5:1 HF followed by a vigorous rinse is used to eliminate stringers. Then the structure is released for 10 minutes in concentrated HF to dissolve the oxide and dried using a critical-point CO 2 drier <ref> [7] </ref> to avoid stiction. A 400 gold layer is evaporated onto mirror surface to increase reflectivity. CHARACTERIZATION Characterization of the vibromotor alone has been described in a previous publication and has shown the slider motion to have a step resolution of less than 0.3 m m [ 8].

Reference-contexts: A 400 gold layer is evaporated onto mirror surface to increase reflectivity. CHARACTERIZATION Characterization of the vibromotor alone has been described in a previous publication and has shown the slider motion to have a step resolution of less than 0.3 m m <ref> [ 8] </ref>. In this paper, vibromotor performance in an integrated microreflector system (Figure 1) is characterized. To measure the precision of the actuated microreflector, a HeNe laser is reflected from the micromirror surface onto a CCD camera. <p> The position of the beam and the drive voltage were then monitored on a digital oscilloscope. The resulting trace is shown in Figure 3. As predicted and observed in <ref> [8] </ref>, the comb structures require a few cycles (3 in this case) to build up sufficient energy for impact. The first significant impact occurs during the third cycle at which point the mirror angle begins to change.
