Abstract: We present the following results about IDA* and related algorithms: * We show that IDA* is not asymptotically optimal in all of the cases where it was thought to be so. In particular, there are trees satisfying all of the conditions previously thought to guarantee asymptotic optimality for IDA*, such that IDA* will expand more than O(N ) nodes, where N is the number of nodes eligible for ex pansion by A*. * We present a new set of necessary and sufficient conditions to guarantee that IDA* ex pands O(N ) nodes on trees.

Reference-contexts: A* (Hart & Nilsson & Raphael, 1968; Nilsson, 1980) is a well-known heuristic search algorithm. A* has been shown to be very efficient in terms of number of node expansions (which is also a measure of its time complexity) in most cases <ref> (Dechter & Pearl, 1985) </ref>. However, one major problem with A* is that it requires exponential amount of memory to run. Due to this, A* runs out of memory even on problem instances of moderate size.
