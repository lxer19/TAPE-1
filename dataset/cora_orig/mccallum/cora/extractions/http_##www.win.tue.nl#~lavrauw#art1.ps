Reference-contexts: We construct s-fold blocking sets of size s (q + p P G (2; q), with s = q 1=4 + 1, which are not the union of s disjoint Baer subplanes. 2. The representations In the following we will use representations of projective spaces used in <ref> [1] </ref> and [3]. The points of P G (2; q) are the 1-dimensional subspaces of GF (q 3 ), considered as a 3-dimensional vector space over GF (q). <p> For a survey on the use of polynomials of this type in finite geometries, see <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 (q + 1)-FOLD BLOCKING SETS 3. Construction We work in the Desarguesian projective plane P G (2; q t ). The points of P G (2; q t ) are the one-dimensional subspaces of V (3; q t ).

Reference-contexts: If the s-fold blocking set B in P G (2; q) contains a line `, then B n ` is a (s 1)-fold blocking set in AG (2; q) = P G (2; q) n `. The result from <ref> [2] </ref> gives the following: Let B be an s-fold blocking set in P G (2; q) that contains a line and e maximal such that p e j (s 1), then jBj (s + 1)q p e + 1.

Reference-contexts: If a blocking set contains a line of P G (2; q), then it is called trivial. A blocking set is said to be minimal or irreducible if it contains no proper subset which also forms a blocking set. For a survey on blocking sets, see Blokhuis <ref> [4] </ref>. There is less known about s-fold blocking sets, where s &gt; 1. If the s-fold blocking set B in P G (2; q) contains a line `, then B n ` is a (s 1)-fold blocking set in AG (2; q) = P G (2; q) n `.

Reference-contexts: A Baer subplane of a projective plane of order q is a subplane of order p q.

Reference-contexts: D and B (B) induces a 4-dimensional subspace B of V (12; q) contained in the 8-dimensional subspace corresponding to L, which 4 (q + 1)-FOLD BLOCKING SETS intersect every element of the spread S in a zero or two-dimensional subspace of V (12; q). (See Bose, Freeman and Glynn <ref> [9, Section 3] </ref> for a representation of a Baer subplane in P G (5; q), which is analogous to this.) We will prove that ~ B cannot be contained in ~ D.

Reference-contexts: The points of P G (2; q t ), seen as (t 1)-dimensional subspaces in P G (3t 1; q), form a normal spread S of P G (3t 1; q), see <ref> [11] </ref>. A d-spread of P G (n; q) is a set of d-dimensional pairwise disjoint subspaces which partition the points of the whole space. Throughout this paper d is always equal to t 1 and we refer to a (t 1)- spread as simply a spread.

Reference-contexts: Since lines of P G (2; q t ) induce 2t-dimensional subspaces in V (3t; q), it is clear that every (t + 1)-dimensional subspace in V (3t; q) induces a blocking set in P G (2; q t ), see <ref> [12] </ref>. Every (t+2)-dimensional subspace in V (3t; q) also induces a blocking set in P G (2; q t ).
