Abstract: The research described here was carried out in the MU-LINEX project (Erbach et al. 1997), the goal of which is to develop techniques for the effective retrieval of multilingual documents from the WWW. Special attention is given to presenting search results in such a way that users are supported in selecting documents that are relevant to their information needs. The presentation of search results includes: the language of the document; an automatically generated summary; a thematic classification; title; URL and document size. The purpose of the summaries is to increase retrieval effectiveness (recall of relevant documents) and efficiency (precision in visiting relevant documents without wasting time by looking at too many irrelevant ones). In order to get some information as to what extent different types of automatically generated summaries aid retrieval and systematically evaluate user needs and behaviour in this area, we conducted a psychological experiment. Subjects were given different kinds of summaries and their retrieval performance on two tasks were measured. Since the purpose of the summary is given by its application context we decided to use a mock-up system. This enabled us to simulate the search task in a realistic way while reducing variance as much as possible. The subjects were given the task to submit a predetermined query to a search engine, and to select documents which were relevant to a given information need by looking through lists of potentially relevant documents. The information needs were formulated as follows:

Reference-contexts: The semantic differential used was designed for software evaluation in general. There is no doubt a need to identify more appropriate factors for the user-rating of summaries in the retrieval context. These could be obtained in part from summary typologies as outlined by Hutchins <ref> (Hutchins 1993) </ref> or intrinsic criteria such as conciseness. The subjects' comments could prove a useful source of criteria, e.g. time-saving vs. time-consuming, coherent vs. disjointed.

Reference-contexts: The comments could also serve as a useful source of ranking criteria for semantic differentials used in future summary evaluation work. A possible extension to this work may be the in depth analysis of summaries for cross-lingual information retrieval wrt. a descriptive framework for summaries <ref> (e.g. Sparck Jones 1993) </ref>; and the identification of mappings between elements of the framework and evaluative methods.

The experiments were designed, carried out and evaluated by DFKI and the media psychology institute, MEFIS e.V.

Reference-contexts: The quantitative evaluation of subject performance and the semantic differentials did not provide statistically significant results. However, the qualitative evaluation of the summaries and summary translations proved fruitful. The following is an overview of the results gained from the experiment.
