Abstract: In this paper we first discuss briefly why electronic journals today have a rather moderate success. We then describe J.UCS the Journal of Universal Computer Science an electronic journal that is the prototype for electronic publishing in the future. Using Hyper-G for distribution it provides all search and navigation mechanisms of large scale hypermedia systems and therefore makes it easy to locate interesting articles. Readers can perform variable scope searches to find papers, then they can browse them on screen either in hypertext mode or in high quality PostScript mode, or they can get high quality PostScript documents for printing. Even PostScript documents provide full hyperlink support when reading them on screen. Articles in J.UCS can be accessed very fast using a wide net of servers distributed all over the world. J.UCS also supports annotations to existing articles informing the readers of new research results or errors. Writing articles for J.UCS is very easy using PostScript as the main submission format, even standard hyperlinks such as literature references are generated automatically. We close this paper with a short comparison of J.UCS to other electronic journals and with an outlook on future developments. Key Words: J.UCS, Hyper-G, electronic publishing, electronic journals.

Reference-contexts: The textual format 120 for J.UCS documents is HTF, the native hypertext format of Hyper-G (a for-mat based on SGML), more complex parts of a J.UCS paper (e.g. formulae) are stored as inline images. Hyper-G is also compatible with WWW <ref> [Berners-Lee 92] </ref> and Gopher [Al-berti 92] in the sense that WWW and Gopher viewers can be used for Hyper-G documents. We recommend, however, to use our native Hyper-G viewers for J.UCS to avoid loss of some functionality.

Reference-contexts: Since PostScript is highly compressible high quality PostScript documents are only slightly larger than their HTF counterparts, depending on their contents. 4 The Kernel of J.UCS - Hyper-G The Kernel of J.UCS is a networked multimedia system called Hyper-G (see e.g. <ref> [Kappe 93a] </ref>, [Kappe 93b] and [Maurer 94] for a detailed description of Hyper-G). Hyper-G as the first second generation hypermedia system [see Andrews 94] is today one of the most powerful multimedia systems and was developed by a team of specialists between 1989 and today.
