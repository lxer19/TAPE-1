Reference-contexts: For example, the SCA can be used to adjust the rate of each stream in order to reduce the I/O demand in the SSs <ref> [2] </ref>. It can also provide timing information for the SS to achieve initial synchronisations between related streams for playing back, though it is preferred that stringent synchronisation is performed near the sink by a stream/group agent method [3].

Reference-contexts: It can also provide timing information for the SS to achieve initial synchronisations between related streams for playing back, though it is preferred that stringent synchronisation is performed near the sink by a stream/group agent method <ref> [3] </ref>. In this case, the SCA can be used to adjust subsequent data sending time from the SSs based on the feedback from the stream/group agent for the latter to maintain jitter and skew bound in the sink. An SCF usually resides on one machine attached to the network.

Reference-contexts: First, there is disk device uncertainty because of the uncertain seek and rotation delay, defect management, zoned bit recording (ZBR), thermal recalibration, retrying, and the intelligence of the controllers etc.. Second, even if most of the disk parameters can be extracted <ref> [4] </ref> and simulated [5], the on-line estimation and application of the service time based on simulation can be computationally prohibitive. Third, there is activity dependency, as disk activities are not the only ones in a storage system. Fourth, there is processing time variability.

Reference-contexts: Fourth, there is processing time variability. For VBR streams, the amount of time needed to deal with (disk read/write, CPU process, network transmit/receive) the data that can be played back for the same period will vary. Therefore, it is believed that only when storage devices with deterministic behaviours (e.g. <ref> [6] </ref>) are used and the activities of the whole system besides that of the disk subsystem is considered can the modellings and simulations be realistic.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, an important consideration for QoS guarantee which seems always omitted by most current video server research is that the collective activities associated with one stream should not or should only minimally affect the QoS contract of another during temporary overload situations. In the same spirit as Nemesis <ref> [7] </ref>, this work will reserve a particular resource bandwidth for each stream and police each SCA's request to guarantee that share in the SSs, while resources underused by one stream can be picked up by another.

Reference-contexts: This, coupled with optimised disk scheduling, data layout and prefetching policies, will provide a more predictable service to the clients. 4 Implementation Status Using the ORL direct peripheral infrastructure and ATM interconnect <ref> [8] </ref>, a prototype system based on the above framework has been implemented but without underlying QoS support yet. Video data can be read from several network attached disks and displayed in video tiles which are also attached to the ATM network.

Reference-contexts: Video data can be read from several network attached disks and displayed in video tiles which are also attached to the ATM network. SCFs, FSs and DSs normally reside in ATMos boards, which are simple processing units with direct ATM connections. Different system components interact through CORBA <ref> [9] </ref> interfaces. The software platform is the locally developed OmniORB which is a multi-threaded implementation of ORB.

Reference-contexts: However, the CORBA interfaces are only used for control. Data are transferred between the clients and the SSs directly in a separate channel. 5 Related Work Three file systems based on network striping are Swift <ref> [10] </ref>, Zebra [11] and HPSS [12]. As they are not oriented to multimedia applications, explicit rate control and synchronisations are not dealt with. Also the meta-data management scheme and the separation of DS/FS/SS make the proposed framework more flexible and simpler than other systems.
