Abstract: We look at the Big Match game, a variation of the repeated Matching Pennies game where if the first player plays tails the game ends with the first player receiving the last round's payoff. We study this game when the second player is implemented as a finite automaton. We show several results including: * If we allow player one to run in probabilistic polynomial-time then he still cannot achieve the maximum score but he can get arbitrarily close.

The Big Match works the same way as Matching Pennies except for the following catch: If P1 ever plays t, the game is over, with the final payoff to P1 being 1 if P2 played T in the last round and 0 if P2 played H. <p> The Big Match game can be described by the following payoff matrix: The Big Match: H T t 0? 1? If P1 ever receives a starred payoff, then the game is over and that is his final payoff. Blackwell and Ferguson <ref> [BF] </ref> show that for all * &gt; 0; P1 can achieve an expected final payoff of at least 1 2 * with a polynomial-time strategy, but for no strategy is P1 guaranteed an expected final payoff of exactly 1 2 . <p> Theorem 3.6 For every strategy 1 for P1, there exists an * &gt; 0 and a DFA 2 for P2 such that ( 1 ; 2 ) 1 *: Note: The following proof is based on a similar result in Blackwell and Ferguson <ref> [BF] </ref>, whom in turn credit the argument to Lester Dubins. Proof: Suppose P2 always plays T . If P1 never plays t with positive probability, then P1 receives a final payoff of 0. Therefore, let us assume that at some point, Player I plays t with positive probability.

Fortnow and Whang <ref> [FW] </ref> show the following results about the Matching Pennies game: Theorem 2.1 There is a recursive strategy 1 which is dominant (for the set of all strategies) against the set of polynomial time strategies. ut Theorem 2.2 There exists a polynomial-time strategy that is dominant for the set of regular strategies
