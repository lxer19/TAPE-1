Abstract: Let t be the infinite fixed point, starting with 1, of the morphism : 0 ! 01, 1 ! 10. An infinite word over f0; 1g is said to be overlap-free if it contains no factor of the form axaxa, where a 2 f0; 1g and x 2 f0; 1g fl . We prove that the lexicographically least infinite overlap-free binary word beginning with any specified prefix, if it exists, has a suffix which is a suffix of t. In particular, the lexicographically least infinite overlap-free binary word is 001001t.

Reference-contexts: The question of extremality (for the lexicographic order) of overlap-free binary infinite words seems to have been addressed only once: Berstel proved <ref> [4] </ref>, (see also [5]), that the lexicographically greatest infinite overlap-free word on the binary alphabet f0; 1g that begins with 0 is the Thue-Morse sequence t = 01101001 , which shows once more the ubiquity of this sequence. (Recall that t is one of the fixed points of the morphism 0 <p> Hence (y) (x) = y, since is order-preserving. The sequence (y) is overlap-free as it is the image under of an overlap-free sequence. Hence we must have (y) = y from the minimality of y. Hence y = t. [We remark that this result was already proved by Berstel <ref> [4] </ref> in the following "dual" form: the lexicographically greatest infinite overlap-free word on the binary alphabet f0; 1g that begins with 0 is the Thue-Morse sequence t = 01101001 .] (b) Suppose that x (w) exists, and that z x (w) is overlap-free.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Since the pioneering work of Thue [14, 15] (see also <ref> [5] </ref>) the overlap-free words on a finite alphabet, i.e., those words that do not contain a factor axaxa, where x is a word and a a letter, have been studied extensively. <p> The question of extremality (for the lexicographic order) of overlap-free binary infinite words seems to have been addressed only once: Berstel proved [4], (see also <ref> [5] </ref>), that the lexicographically greatest infinite overlap-free word on the binary alphabet f0; 1g that begins with 0 is the Thue-Morse sequence t = 01101001 , which shows once more the ubiquity of this sequence. (Recall that t is one of the fixed points of the morphism 0 ! 01, 1 <p> Hence such a sequence must begin with 00101, hence with 0010110. On the other hand, it is well-known that t is extendable to the left to a doubly-infinite overlap-free sequence ([15, Satz 7], [12], <ref> [5, p. 30] </ref>). 5 The lexicographically least square-free sequence As already proved by Thue, it is possible to construct, on a three-letter alphabet, a sequence without squares, i.e., without any factor of the form ww, where w is a nonempty word. (It is readily checked that there is no square-free word

Reference-contexts: Proof. First note that the word y is necessarily overlap-free by assertion 1 of Lemma 2. The existence of the decomposition for finite words is proved in <ref> [10] </ref>, in the proof of Theorem 6.4. The uniqueness is proved in [11], Lemma 2.2. Finally in this factorization of x, the word u (resp. v) depends only on the prefix (resp. suffix) of x of length 7.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, it seems that in the factorization lemma we give below (Lemma 3), the question of uniqueness of the decomposition was first addressed in <ref> [11] </ref>. We start with a technical lemma. Lemma 1 1. If y; y 0 2 f0; 1g fl , and if there exist c; d 2 f0; 1g such that u = c (y) = (y 0 )d, then u = c (c c) jyj . 2. <p> Proof. First note that the word y is necessarily overlap-free by assertion 1 of Lemma 2. The existence of the decomposition for finite words is proved in [10], in the proof of Theorem 6.4. The uniqueness is proved in <ref> [11] </ref>, Lemma 2.2. Finally in this factorization of x, the word u (resp. v) depends only on the prefix (resp. suffix) of x of length 7. <p> Then, by Lemma 2, 1 (101y 0 z) = x (1101y 0 ). Finally j1101y 0 j = j1yvj &lt; j00 (y)vj = jwj. The same reasoning holds if u = 11. Remark 1. The algorithm we give resembles an algorithm given in <ref> [11] </ref> to decide (in linear time) whether a finite binary word contains an overlap. Remark 2. Let us show an example of how the algorithm works.

Lemma 1 1. <p> The Thue-Morse sequences t and t are overlap-free. The sequences 0t, 1t, 0 t, and 1 t are overlap-free. 4. The sequences 01 t, 10 t, 110 t, and 001001 t are overlap-free. the electronic journal of combinatorics 5 (1998),#R27 4 Proof. 1. This is proved in <ref> [15] </ref>. 2. (a) As in [15], assertion 1 above immediately extends to infinite words, showing that (x) is overlap-free if and only if x is overlap-free. (b) Now if the infinite word 0 (x) contains an overlap, then the word s = 10 (x) a fortiori contains an overlap. <p> The sequences 0t, 1t, 0 t, and 1 t are overlap-free. 4. The sequences 01 t, 10 t, 110 t, and 001001 t are overlap-free. the electronic journal of combinatorics 5 (1998),#R27 4 Proof. 1. This is proved in <ref> [15] </ref>. 2. (a) As in [15], assertion 1 above immediately extends to infinite words, showing that (x) is overlap-free if and only if x is overlap-free. (b) Now if the infinite word 0 (x) contains an overlap, then the word s = 10 (x) a fortiori contains an overlap. <p> This proves (d). The proof of (e) is similar. 3. The Thue-Morse sequence t is the limit, as n ! 1, of the binary words n (1) which are all overlap-free, since 1 is overlap-free: this is Thue's proof <ref> [15] </ref>. Let a 2 f0; 1g, and suppose that a t contains an overlap. Then the overlap must be a prefix of a t. Hence there exists a finite word z such that t begins with zaza. We will show that this is impossible.
