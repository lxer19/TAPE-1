Abstract: We present a novel language for querying object-oriented databases. The language is built around the idea of extended path expressions that substantially generalize [ZAN83], and on an adaptation of the first-order formalization of object-oriented languages from [KW89, KLW90, KW92]. The language incorporates features not found in earlier proposals; it is easier to use and has greater expressive power. Some of the salient features of our language are: * The notions of a type and type-correctness have precise meaning. It accommodates a wide variety of queries that might be deemed well- or ill-typed under different circumstances. In particular, we show that there is more than one way of settling the issue of type correctness. For expository purposes and due to space limitation, we chose to make a number of simplifying assumptions and left some features out. A more complete account can be found in [KSK92].

Reference-contexts: Views in our language are constructed via queries, in line with the relational model. This is simpler and more uniform than the construction of views in <ref> [AB91] </ref>, and circumvents certain problems that have to be dealt with there. Furthermore, views and non-views can be referred to in the same query. The issues concerning the expressive power are beyond the scope of this paper.

Reference-contexts: The language is capable of expressing sophisticated queries in a very concise way. This is achieved via extended path expressions, which are more expressive than any of the previous manifestations (for example, <ref> [ZAN83, BEEC88, CLUE89, DLR88] </ref>) of the dot notation for nested structures. We extended path expressions with the concept of selector, accommodated methods, and "higher-order" variables 22 that range over method names and classes.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, views and non-views can be referred to in the same query. The issues concerning the expressive power are beyond the scope of this paper. Suffices it to mention that we can show that the proposed language has the expressive power of first-order queries in F-logic <ref> [KLW90] </ref> (which are analogous to queries in Codd's relational calculus, but are built on an object-oriented logic.)

Reference-contexts: First we need to find an assignment A and an execution plan P such that A is valid, complete, and coherent with P . For any such plan P , it is easy to write a nested loop program that evaluates the answer to the query. In <ref> [KSK92] </ref> we show how to find coherent pairs (A; P ). The following theorem (whose proof appears in [KSK92]) shows that it suffices to evaluate the query with respect to just one such coherent pair. <p> For any such plan P , it is easy to write a nested loop program that evaluates the answer to the query.

Moreover, for each v-selector X it suffices to limit instantiations to oids taken from A (X).
