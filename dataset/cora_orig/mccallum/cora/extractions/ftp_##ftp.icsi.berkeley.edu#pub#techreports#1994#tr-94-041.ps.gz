Abstract: The rectilinear Steiner tree problem requires to find a shortest tree connecting a given set of terminal points in the plane with rectilinear distance. We show that the performance ratios of Zelikovsky's[17] heuristic is between 1.3 and 1.3125 (before it was only bounded from above by 1.375), while the performance ratio of the heuristic of Berman and Ramaiyer[1] is at most 1.271 (while the previous bound was 1.347). Moreover, we provide O(nlog 2 n)-time algorithms that satisfy these performance ratios.

Reference-contexts: While in all metric spaces the performance ratio of this heuristic is at most 2 [16], Hwang [10] proved that in the rectilinear plane the performance ratio of this heuristic equals exactly 1.5. Zelikovsky [17] and Berman/Ramaiyer <ref> [1] </ref> gave two better heuristics for RSP. Now we give a more precise analysis of the performance ratio of these heuristics. Our results are the following: 1. Zelikovsky's algorithm has a performance ratio between 1.3 and 1.3125. 2. <p> Zelikovsky's algorithm has a performance ratio between 1.3 and 1.3125. 2. The Berman/Ramaiyer algorithm has a performance ratio of at most 61 48 3. The now best approximation of factor 1.271 can be found in time O (n log 2 n) considerably improving the previous approximation <ref> [1] </ref> not only in quality, but also in efficiency. The previous time bound was O (n 3:5 ). 2 In the next section we provide a synopsis of the two approaches of Zelikovsky and Berman/Ramaiyer. In Sections 3, 4 and 5, we derive new estimates for the performance ratios. <p> So, t 2 (S) is the length of the min. spanning tree of S. t 2 3 2 s [10], t 3 5 and generally t k 2k1 2k2 s <ref> [1] </ref>. These bounds are tight for k = 2; 3 but in general t k 2k 2k1 s for k 4. The main idea of the new heuristics is to obtain good krestricted Steiner trees and to show how they approximate a Steiner minimum tree. <p> At the end, we remove zero-cost edges from MST (D [ Z) and replace them with the chosen T (z)'s. The output of this heuristic has length of at most t 2 +t 3 2 [17]. Before we describe the Berman/Ramaiyer heuristic (BR) <ref> [1] </ref>, we have to look closer at the way how to obtain MST (D [ Z (z)) from M = MST (D). Say that Z (z) = fe 1 ; e 2 g. <p> The length of the output of BR3 is at most t 2 + 3 (2) How can we bound the values (1) and (2)? Obviously t fl 3 t 3 and t fl (1) and (2) is at most 11 8 s and 97 72 s, respectively <ref> [1] </ref>. In the next section we develop tools that provide bounds for the linear combinations of t 2 ; t fl 3 and t fl 4 that are far better than the linear combinations of the bounds above. <p> V [ fc 1 ; c 2 g where c 1 and c 2 are the Steiner points of the quadruple, contains the edges (u; c 1 ); (v; c 1 ); (c 1 ; c 2 ); (w; c 2 ) and (z; c 2 ). &gt;From results in <ref> [1] </ref> and [5] we know that we only have to consider tree quadruples where the rectangles defined by the point sets fu,vg, fv,wg and fw,zg do not contain any other points. <p> This paper almost closes the first approach to improve the approximation ratio for rectilinear Steiner trees, bringing the ratio down from 3/2 [10], via 11/8 <ref> [17, 1] </ref> now to 61/48, which is very close to 5/4. The next task is to jump below the 5/4-barrier.

Theorem 4 At most 96n quadruples are necessary for the approximation claimed in Theorem 3. 7 Computation of Quadruples To compute the normal quadruples we need a fast method to find top points v with empty butterfly. <p> The necessary cross quadruples can be found in time O (n log 2 n) <ref> [2] </ref>. After computing the triples and quadruples, we can apply the algorithm of Berman/Ramaiyer for 4-restricted Steiner trees and get an approximation as stated in Theorem 3.

Reference-contexts: For the running time the only problem is maintaining an MST in the Selection Phase. 14 But since the structure always stays planar we can use the data structure introduced in <ref> [4] </ref> that allows maintaining an MST in time O (log n) per step. <p> Since every pair of edges that ever appear in the course of the algorithm has no crossing, we can maintain an MST in the Selection Phase in time O (log n) per step <ref> [4] </ref>. Thus the time bound of Theorem 6 is proved.

Reference-contexts: We show that it is sufficient to regard only a linear number of each triples and quadruples. In <ref> [5] </ref> this fact is shown for triples and there is given an algorithm to construct these triples in time O (nlog 2 n). So it remains to show that a linear number of quadruples is enough for our algorithm. <p> fc 1 ; c 2 g where c 1 and c 2 are the Steiner points of the quadruple, contains the edges (u; c 1 ); (v; c 1 ); (c 1 ; c 2 ); (w; c 2 ) and (z; c 2 ). &gt;From results in [1] and <ref> [5] </ref> we know that we only have to consider tree quadruples where the rectangles defined by the point sets fu,vg, fv,wg and fw,zg do not contain any other points. Lemma 5 For a given left root u and a top point v there is at most one bottom point w. <p> We conclude: Theorem 5 For any rectilinear Steiner tree problem an 1.271-approximation can be found in time O (n 3=2 ). 8 A Faster Approximation In this section we give a generalization of the fast parameterized version of BR presented in <ref> [5] </ref>. The main idea is, not to update the whole configuration after each step, but to sort triples and later quadruples according to their gain, and to evaluate those stars according to this sorting, even if it changed meanwhile. <p> Importantly, we have several possibilities to connect the terminals of a quadruple, i.e. e 1 and e 2 are not strictly fixed. We choose these new edges such that the structure remains planar. The main difference to the algorithm described in <ref> [5] </ref> is that we now have to run a Selection Phase which we could avoid in the case of considering only triples. <p> Phase 1 is the same as in the algorithm in <ref> [5] </ref>, so we only analyse Phase 2. 15 The loss due to a) and b) is easily counted: With the same arguments as in the proofs of Lemma 7 and 8 in [5] we can state that the total loss here can be bounded by the fraction 1 96 r2 + <p> Phase 1 is the same as in the algorithm in <ref> [5] </ref>, so we only analyse Phase 2. 15 The loss due to a) and b) is easily counted: With the same arguments as in the proofs of Lemma 7 and 8 in [5] we can state that the total loss here can be bounded by the fraction 1 96 r2 + 3 m of the total gain. <p> The introduction of new techniques for estimating the length of different classes of Steiner trees enables to considerably improve the best known approximation factors. Somewhat surprisingly, the same time bounds of O (n log 2 n) can be achieved as before <ref> [5] </ref>, although we have to use much more involved methods. This paper almost closes the first approach to improve the approximation ratio for rectilinear Steiner trees, bringing the ratio down from 3/2 [10], via 11/8 [17, 1] now to 61/48, which is very close to 5/4.
