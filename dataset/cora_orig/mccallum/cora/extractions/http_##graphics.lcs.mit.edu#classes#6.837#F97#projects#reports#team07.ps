Abstract: 6.837 Final Project Report Abstract | Introduction | Goals | Achievements | Preliminary Results | Individual Contributions | Lessons Abstract We have developed a system to optimize the acoustic properties of a concert hall using genetic programming. To do this, we have employed a simulation method that is similar to ray-tracing. We have identified relevant acoustic characteristcs and have developed three visualizations to illustrate both the optimized concert halls and the workings of the genetic programming method.
