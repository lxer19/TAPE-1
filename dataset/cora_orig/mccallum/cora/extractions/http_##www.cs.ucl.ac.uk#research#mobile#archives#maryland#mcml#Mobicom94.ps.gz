Abstract: As mobile computers move from one place to another their "physical" points of attachment to network change from time to time. Host movement causes service disruption. Mobile-IP protocols attempts to solve this problem by hiding the effect of change in network service access point from the transport and higher layers. Thus, Mobile-IP ensures that a mobile host "virtually" remains connected to its home regardless of its current point of attachment. This allows existing applications to operate over mobile nodes without any modifications. While away from home, mobile hosts continue to access services from servers located at the home network. Applications running on mobile hosts, therefore, experience increased latency as accesses to home resources (such as name server, file server etc.) are routed over multiple links and routers. To alleviate this problem, new mechanisms are required that enable mobile hosts to discover and access needed resources on the foreign network. In this paper, we outline alternative approaches for providing such mechanisms and discuss their relative merits and limitations. The recent advances in wireless communication technology, coupled with the progress in hardware miniaturization, are taking us into a new era of computing, popularly known as nomadic computing. Battery powered, untethered computers are likely to become a pervasive part of our computing infrastructure. There are, however, many technical challenges involved before the vision of ubiquitous computing can be realized. Paramount among these is the challenge of providing continuous, location independent network access to mobile computers. Traditionally, the data Over the last two years, many enhancements to existing networking protocols have been suggested which enable mobile hosts to move around a network [2, 4, 5, 6]. Ideally, mobile hosts can change their network attachment point, in a fashion which is completely transparent to the transport layer protocols and the applications running above them. All proposed solutions for Mobile-IP, for example, meet this goal. The Mobile-IP approach [3] automatically provides location transparency. Portable Computers, like any other desktop computer, need to access resources such as NFS file system, name servers, etc. Existing portable systems are configured to make use of resources available on their home networks. As a result, portable systems continue to access services from the home network even though they might not be physically connected to it. This restriction gives rise to many performance problems since every access to home servers is routed across multiple, possibly slow, links. Slow links introduce delays and cause performance degradation visible to the mobile user. By developing a resource discovery protocol, we can hope to allow more local access to needed resources, and thus provide performance transparency to mobile users in addition to location transparency. fl This work is supported in part by NSF grant CCR 9318933
