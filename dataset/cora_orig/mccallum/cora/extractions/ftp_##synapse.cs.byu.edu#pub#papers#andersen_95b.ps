Abstract: All current rule-based methods found in the literature use some form of heuristic(s) in order to limit the size of the rule search space examined by the learning algorithm. This paper is an attempt to determine (mainly from an empirical standpoint) how generalization performance is affected when certain areas of the rule search space are ignored, as compared to when the entire search space is considered. This is done by exhaustively generating all rules for several small real-world problems and then determining how accuracy decreases as the size of the search space is iteratively reduced. The results show that higher-order rules are not required to approximate many real world learning problems. In dealing with the above question, several methods for inducing rules and using them for classification of novel examples are tested.

Reference-contexts: Formally, for each f F, f . metric = e e E e.class = f .class match ( f ,e) - e e E match ( f ,e) - . Delta Rule: With this method, an algorithm similar to the simple perceptron training algorithm <ref> (Rosenblatt 1958) </ref> is used to assign metrics to rules. This algorithm has the advantage that it is guaranteed to converge to a solution if the elements in the training set are linearly separable.
