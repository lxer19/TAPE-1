Definition. <p> The following lemma is implicit in Ambos-Spies and Zheng's recent proof that every n 2 -random language in E is weakly P m -complete for E. Lemma 3.3 (Martingale Dilation Lemma Ambos-Spies and Zheng <ref> [1] </ref>). If f : f0; 1g fl ! f0; 1g fl is strictly increasing and d is a martingale, then f^d is also a martingale. Moreover, for every language A f0; 1g fl , if d succeeds on f 1 (A), then f^d succeeds on A. 5 Proof. <p> We first mention two known results that are used in our argument.

More recently, Lutz <ref> [9, 10, 11, 12] </ref> has used martingales as a means of developing measure in complexity classes. Definition. 1. A martingale is a function d : f0; 1g fl !

Definition <ref> [9] </ref>. 1. A set X of languages has p-measure 0, and we write p (X) = 0, if there is a p-martingale d such that X S 1 [d]. 2. <p> A set X of languages has p 2 measure 0, and we write p 2 (X) = 0, if there is a p 2 -martingale d such that X S 1 [d].

Similarly, the expression (XjE 2 ) 6= 0 means that X does not have measure 0 in E 2 . It is shown in <ref> [9] </ref> that these definitions endow E and E 2 with internal measure structure. This structure justifies the intuition that, if (XjE) = 0, then X " E is a negligibly small subset of E (and similarly for E 2 ). In particular, we have the following. Theorem 3.4 (Lutz [9]). 1. <p> in <ref> [9] </ref> that these definitions endow E and E 2 with internal measure structure.

A language A f0; 1g fl is p-random, and we write A 2 RAND (p), if p (fAg) 6= 0, i.e., if the singleton set fAg does not have p-measure 0. That is, A is p-random if there is no p-martingale that succeeds on A. <p> That is, A is p-random if there is no p-martingale that succeeds on A.

Reference-contexts: Problems that are complete for exponential time are provably intractable by the time hierarchy theorem of Hartmanis and Stearns [3]. In fact, such problems are now known to have very strong intractability properties <ref> [2, 4, 8, 14, 19, etc.] </ref>. Recently, Juedes and Lutz [7] initiated investigation of a measure-theoretic generalization of the completeness phenomenon in the exponential time complexity classes E = DTIME (2 linear ) and E 2 = DTIME (2 polynomial ).
