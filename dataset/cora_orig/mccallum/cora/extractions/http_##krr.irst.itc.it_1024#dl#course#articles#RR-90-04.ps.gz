Title: Subsumption Algorithms for Concept Languages  
Author: Bernhard Hollunder Werner Nutt 
Address: Postfach 2080 D-6750 Kaiserslautern, West Germany  
Affiliation: German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence  
Abstract: We investigate the subsumption problem in logic-based knowledge representation languages of the kl-one family and give decision procedures. All our languages contain as a kernel the logical connectives conjunction, disjunction, and negation for concepts, as well as role quantification. The algorithms are rule-based and can be understood as variants of tableaux calculus with a special control strategy. In the first part of the paper, we add number restrictions and conjunction of roles to the kernel language. We show that subsumption in this language is decidable, and we investigate sublanguages for which the problem of deciding subsumption is PSPACE-complete. In the second part, we amalgamate the kernel language with feature descriptions as used in computational linguistics. We show that feature descriptions do not increase the complexity of the subsumption problem.

Reference-contexts: A related family of formalisms emerged in computational linguistics with unification based grammars. Here, constituents of sentences are described in terms of attributes (so-called features) and their values [Sh86, Smo88]. Recently, concept languages have been investigated as a means to describe object oriented data models <ref> [BBMR89] </ref>. A concept is built up of two kinds of primitive symbols, concepts and roles. An interpretation interprets them as subsets of a domain and binary relations over the domain.

Concepts are intended to be descriptions of classes of objects. Essentially, such a description is given in terms of primitive classes and attributes of objects. A related family of formalisms emerged in computational linguistics with unification based grammars. <p> Until recently, a decision procedure was only known for the rather trivial language F L , offering as constructs conjunction, 8P .C, and 9P .&gt; ,where P may be a primitive role and &gt; is a concept denoting the entire domain of an interpretation <ref> [BL84] </ref>. Several complexity results showed that already for 4 seemingly slight extensions of F L the subsumption problem is co-NP-hard [LB87, Neb88]. Other work identified languages with undecidable subsump-tion problem [Pat89, Sch89, Sch88].

In contrast to earlier knowledge representation formalisms like frames and semantic networks, kl-one languages have the advantage of a Tarski style declarative semantics that allows to conceive them as sublanguages of predicate logic [BL84]. <p> Features come with the constructs selection, and agreement and disagreement of feature chains. Selection corresponds to existential quantification of roles. Agreement and disagreement are counterparts of kl-one's so-called "role value maps" <ref> [BS85] </ref>. Smolka shows that a feature language that contains intersection, union and complement of feature descriptions, as well as selection, agreement and disagreement on features, has an NP-complete satis-fiability problem and a co-NP-complete subsumption problem. Interestingly, if agreement is used with roles, then it causes undecidability [Sch89].

Reference-contexts: Complexity results show that in most cases an algorithm based on these ideas is optimal. The algorithms described in this paper require polynomial space and solve PSPACE-complete problems. Similar results hold for sublanguages of ALCN R with respect to other complexity classes <ref> [DHL fl 90] </ref>. Finally, we showed that concept languages of the kl-one-family and feature based description languages as developed in computational linguistics not only are intimately related as regards their semantics (cf. [Smo88]) but also can be treated with similar algorithmic techniques.

Reference-contexts: Several complexity results showed that already for 4 seemingly slight extensions of F L the subsumption problem is co-NP-hard [LB87, Neb88]. Other work identified languages with undecidable subsump-tion problem [Pat89, Sch89, Sch88]. The first nontrivial subsumption algorithm was given by Schmidt-Schau and Smolka <ref> [SS88] </ref> for the language ALC, which extends F L by allowing for arbitrary logical connectives and role quantification as constructs. The algorithm is even optimal, since it requires linear space and they show that subsumption checking in ALC is PSPACE-complete. <p> The algorithms are described by tableaux calculus like rules operating on so-called constraints, which directly correspond to logical formulae. The control is incorporated into the conditions that allow to apply the rules. The idea of a rule based calculus operation on constraints was already underlying the calculus in <ref> [SS88] </ref>, although its presentation obscured its intimate relation to tableaux calculus. We feel that this technique could be applied as well to other kl-one-language constructs that have not been considered in this paper, like inverse roles or agreement of roles. <p> ALCR consists of concepts containing no number restrictions. ALC consists of concepts containing no number restrictions and no intersec tions of roles. The language ALC has been introduced by Schmidt-Schau and Smolka <ref> [SS88] </ref>. They proved that subsumption and satisfiability in this language are PSPACE-complete problems. The names of the other languages are chosen in such a way as to indicate that they extend ALC either by number restrictions or role intersection or both. <p> Theorem 3.5 Satisfiability and subsumption of ALCN R-concepts can be decided with nondeterministic exponential time. Corollary 3.6 An ALCN R-concept has a model if and only if it has a finite model. 4 PSPACE-Complete Languages Satisfiability of ALC-concepts is a PSPACE-complete problem <ref> [SS88] </ref>. Since ALC is a sublanguage of ALCN R it follows that checking satisfiability of ALCN R-concepts is PSPACE-hard. This gives a lower complexity bound. An upper bound is furnished by our calculus that requires nondeterministic exponential time. Better upper bounds exist for special cases. <p> In Section 4.2 we give a linear space algorithm for checking satisfiabil-ity of ALCR-concepts. Since both problems are still more general than the satisfiability of ALC-concepts, it follows that they are PSPACE-complete. The algorithms are inspired by a technique first applied in <ref> [SS88] </ref>. We conclude with a remark on the influence of binary and unary coding of number restrictions on the complexity of deciding satisfiability of ALCN R-concepts. 4.1 Satisfiability of ALCN -Concepts The reason why the general calculus is so cumbersome is in the ! -rule. <p> Thus, sat1 can be executed using space quadratic in the size of C. Since satisfiability of ALC-concepts is PSPACE-complete <ref> [SS88] </ref> and ALC is a sublanguage of ALCN , we have proven the main result of this section.

Recently, concept languages have been investigated as a means to describe object oriented data models [BBMR89]. A concept is built up of two kinds of primitive symbols, concepts and roles. An interpretation interprets them as subsets of a domain and binary relations over the domain. <p> Only recently, the close relation between kl-one-languages and feature formalisms has been pointed out <ref> [Smo88] </ref>. In this paper we introduce a language that encorporates both kl-one-one constructs and features. Features are functional roles, that is they are supposed to have at most one filler. Natural examples for features may be father and first name. <p> Examples for such features may be gender, number, or voice. The main operation on feature descriptions is a test for consistency. In his paper on "Feature Logic", Smolka gave a Tarsky style semantics for feature descriptions and showed that they are closely related to concepts of kl-one-like languages <ref> [Smo88] </ref>, the main difference being that in Feature 21 Logic attributes (called features) are interpreted as partial functions while in kl-one attributes (called roles) are interpreted as arbitrary binary relations. Features come with the constructs selection, and agreement and disagreement of feature chains. Selection corresponds to existential quantification of roles. <p> Similar results hold for sublanguages of ALCN R with respect to other complexity classes [DHL fl 90]. Finally, we showed that concept languages of the kl-one-family and feature based description languages as developed in computational linguistics not only are intimately related as regards their semantics (cf. <ref> [Smo88] </ref>) but also can be treated with similar algorithmic techniques. We presented the language ALCF that combines concepts and feature terms, and showed that adding features did not increase the complexity of the satisfiability and the subsumption problem. 30 Acknowledgements We are grateful to Manfred Schmidt-Schau, Francesco M.

In particular it follows that a formula 9x: C (x) has a finite model if it has a model at all.
