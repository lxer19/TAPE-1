Reference-contexts: The foundation of the BioSCAN hardware is an algorithm based on work done by S. Karlin and S. F. Altschul <ref> [4, 1] </ref>. The BioSCAN project is a cooperative venture combining the efforts of the Department of Computer Science, the Department of Chemistry, and the Program in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with those of MCNC (formerly the Microelectronics Center of North Carolina).

Reference-contexts: Other work will investigate the area of I/O performance. Current database sizes (in the 10's of MBytes) allow efficient buffering of data but, with the expected size of biologic databases projected to exceed billions of characters <ref> [2] </ref>, I/O will become an increasingly important factor in system performance. 20 21 22
