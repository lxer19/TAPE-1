Abstract: Previous work by Mattikalli et al.[1] considered the stability of assemblies of frictionless contacting bodies with uniform gravity. A linear programming-based technique was described that would automatically determine a single stable orientation for an assembly (if such an orientation existed). In this paper, we give an exact characterization of the entire set of stable orientations of any assembly under uniform gravity. Our characterization reveals that the set of stable orientations maps out a convex region on the unit-sphere of directions. The region is bounded by a sequence of vertices adjoined with great arcs. Linear programming techniques are used to automatically find this set of vertices, yielding a precise description of the range of stable orientations for any frictionless assembly.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Geometric models of parts are increasingly being used to automatically plan their manufacture. Assembly of parts can also be automated using geometric models by generating high-level plans of the sequence and manner in which parts are brought together <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. To generate such plans, it is necessary to have tools that simulate the mechanics of bodies in contact. During assembly, contacting bodies are subjected to forces such as gravitational forces, contact forces and gripper/fixture forces.

Reference-contexts: Because the assembly is frictionless, its impending motion is completely determined <ref> [4] </ref>. If there exist repulsive contact forces such that the net force and torque on every body is zero, then such forces will arise at the contact points, and the assembly is stable and will not move.
