Abstract: If two separated observers are supplied with entanglement, in the form of n pairs of particles in identical partly-entangled pure states, one member of each pair being given to each observer; they can, by local actions of each observer, concentrate this entanglement into a smaller number of maximally-entangled pairs of particles, for example Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen singlets, similarly shared between the two observers. The concentration process asymptotically conserves entropy of entanglement|the von Neumann entropy of the partial density matrix seen by either observer|with the yield of singlets approaching, for large n, the base-2 entropy of entanglement of the initial partly-entangled pure state. Conversely, any pure or mixed entangled state of two systems can be produced by two classically-communicating separated observers, drawing on a supply of singlets as their sole source of entanglement.

Reference-contexts: Because A and C are in the same location, (A; C) can be prepared by purely local operations. Next Alice uses a supply of standard singlets, in conjunction with classical communication, to teleport the state of her local system C into Bob's system B. This has the effect <ref> [4] </ref> of destroying the entanglement between A and C while creating the desired entangled state (A; B) shared remotely between Alice and Bob.

Reference-contexts: Since any mixed state can be regarded as a pure state over a larger, and partly unseen, Hilbert space, it might seem more elegant (cf <ref> [9] </ref>) to define the entanglement of a bipartite mixed state AB as the minimum entanglement of any pure state (ABCD) of a four-part system, from which AB can be obtained by tracing over states of C and D, and where the entanglement of (ABCD) is computed by partitioning it into subsystems

Reference-contexts: A nontrivial example of an entangled mixed state is provided by the Werner state <ref> [10] </ref>, whose density matrix is W = 8 1 fi fi fi where I is the 4x4 identity matrix and is a singlet.

Reference-contexts: Recently it has been shown <ref> [11] </ref> that the Werner state can be constructed much 17 more economically, as a mixture of pure states each containing only about 0.1176 ebits of entanglement. Moreover, a small yield 0:0001258 of arbitrarily pure singlets can be distilled from Werner states by local actions and classical communication [11]. <p> has been shown <ref> [11] </ref> that the Werner state can be constructed much 17 more economically, as a mixture of pure states each containing only about 0.1176 ebits of entanglement. Moreover, a small yield 0:0001258 of arbitrarily pure singlets can be distilled from Werner states by local actions and classical communication [11]. Thus impure Werner states can be both created from and converted into pure singlets. This two-way conversion is a rough mixed-state analog of the processes of pure-state entanglement concentration and dilution which have been the principal subject of the present paper.

Yield of maximally-entangled output states from partly-entangled input states (cos "# sin #"), as a function of cos 2 . Highest curve is entropy of entanglement of input state, equal to the asymptotic yield of the Schmidt projection method. Successively lower smooth curves give yields of Schmidt projection applied to n = 32, 8, 4, and 2 input pairs. The fl-shaped curve gives yield by the Procrustean method applied to one input pair. </title> <type> 20 </type>
