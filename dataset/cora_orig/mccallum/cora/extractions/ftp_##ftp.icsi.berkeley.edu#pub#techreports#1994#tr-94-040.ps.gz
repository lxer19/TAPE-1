Abstract: The Internet Protocol was designed to be used with packet-switched communication networks and, as originally designed, does not provide the characteristics necessary to support voice and video transmission. The lack of control over the amount of connections supported leads to highly variable delays for packets and often to packet loss. In this paper, an enhancement of an IP based node (called IP') is presented to allow a simple management of the node's resources. We introduce higher interaction between the transport and the network layers through additional processes and functions. The paper also presents, as an example, a transport layer protocol that shows how to take advantage of the new functionalities provided by the IP' nodes. Two fundamental hypothesis throughout the design process were: 1) the effort in moving an IP-based node to an IP'-based node had to be smaller than the effort required in moving to a completely different protocol suite, and 2) the regular Internet traffic should not be affected or modified at all. Simulations results are presented to show that this approach can actually bound the variation of delay and throughput. In addition this approach can also control the number of packets lost.

Reference-contexts: We want the network to be capable of limiting the variability in the provided throughput and also to limit the range of values among which the packets' delay can vary. These two characteristics are referred to as deterministic throughput bound and deterministic delay bound <ref> [1] </ref>. Internet, the most widely used internetwork, principally uses IP as a network layer protocol. IP was designed for use in interconnected systems of packet-switched communication networks and, as originally designed, did not provide the throughput and delay characteristics necessary to support voice and video applications.

As seen in Section 3.1 the node service time is modeled using the three parameters k m , k d and k i . The values used were obtained from <ref> [15] </ref> and are valid for s max 512 bytes. They are: k m = 341 fl 10 6 [msec]; k d = 183 fl 10 6 [msec]; k i = 450 fl 10 3 [msec].

Reference-contexts: Packet's format IP packet structure doesn't need to be modified to handle RDP and there is also no need for packets' encapsulation. The number 117 is proposed as a new value for field protocol to identify RDP <ref> [17] </ref>. RDP packets' structure is presented in Figure 6.

Reference-contexts: The field Max Packet Size contains the value of s max , while field Packet Length contains the actual length of each packet.

Reference-contexts: The IP rr finally redirect the packet to the predefined output NIF. 11 5 Simulation results A model of the IP' based nodes was designed to analyze its behavior and to measure the performance of the RDP protocol. The model is based on the implementation described in <ref> [19] </ref>. The queuing network structure of a node is shown in Fig. 8. In this case a node with 3 I/O NIF is shown. As seen in Section 3.1 the node service time is modeled using the three parameters k m , k d and k i .

Reference-contexts: RDP obtains higher performance from the network using the capabilities of the IP' nodes either to allocate resources to a connection and to make each connection follow a unique path. This last feature could be more effective with the associated use of improved routing table update mechanism (e.g., see <ref> [20] </ref>), in order to provide each node with the most updated information about the network load. 15 Simulations results were presented to show the behavior of the protocol in different situation and with different values for the characterizing parameters.

Reference-contexts: Policing algorithms could be inserted so that, when an attempt to violate the requests is detected, corrections can be taken. For instance if a source tries to send data with a rate higher than the declared R max , an approach like the leaky bucket can be used <ref> [21] </ref>. Also a way for RDP protocol to provide the user application with some feedback information about the packets delay and throughput variation would be useful.
