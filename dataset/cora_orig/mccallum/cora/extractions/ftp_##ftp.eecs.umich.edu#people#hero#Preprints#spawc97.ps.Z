Abstract: It is well known that direct implementation of the optimal multiuser receiver for an asynchronous Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) communication system has an exponential complexity in the number of users. In this paper we present an iterative implementation of an optimal multiuser receiver which has at most cubic complexity per iteration in the number of users. The receiver performs joint Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation of the amplitudes, phases, time delays, and symbol sequences of all the users. Similarly to the single user receiver we presented in [1], the multiuser receiver is based on a signal decomposition with respect to a compactly supported orthonormal wavelet basis. The algorithm uses grouped coordinate ascent updates to increase the likelihood function in each iteration. Simulation results of a two user system are presented showing that the receiver is near-far resistant, and attains the single user bit error probability bound.

Reference-contexts: The results indicate that both users practically achieve the single user BPSK bound. For comparison, the results of a conventional receiver for user 1 are shown. The conventional receiver was implemented with the single user algorithm of <ref> [1] </ref> assuming known gain and time delay. Clearly, the conventional receiver's performance degrades compared to the multiuser receiver with the increase of SNR, although it gives comparable performance at the lower end of the SNR range. first case, both users achieve the single user bound.

Reference-contexts: We derive an efficient digital algorithm that can be executed in real time, has a fixed complexity, and only requires a "single pass" over the received signal. The GCA algorithm is related to a class of EM algorithms known as Space Alternating Generalized EM (SAGE) algorithms <ref> [2] </ref>, and like SAGE its asymptotic convergence rate is significantly better than standard EM. The implementation of the algorithm is facilitated by expanding the signal on a time-frequency localized basis. <p> Updating a single coordinate in each iteration, leads to a rapid convergence but increases the likelihood of the algorithm being trapped in a local maximum. Generally, the convergence rate is inversely related to the Fisher information of the complete data space <ref> [2] </ref>. Sequential group updates yield a fast algorithm with tractable maximization steps. The algorithm was tested in the range of SNR from -2dB to 8dB. Wavelet decomposition on 6 scales was performed using the Daubechies compactly supported wavelet basis of filter length N = 4.

Reference-contexts: The optimal multiuser receiver, in the sense of jointly maximizing the likelihood of the transmitted symbol sequences of all the users, was studied in <ref> [3] </ref>. The optimal receiver has an exponential complexity in the number of users, requires the knowledge of user energies and time delays, and has a large decoding delay, so it is generally impractical.

Reference-contexts: The optimal receiver has an exponential complexity in the number of users, requires the knowledge of user energies and time delays, and has a large decoding delay, so it is generally impractical. Suboptimal receivers with a linear complexity in the number of users, such as the decorrelating receiver <ref> [4] </ref>, have been investigated. Receivers of this type are near-far resistant, but they enhance the noise.

Reference-contexts: This expansion allows us to develop a simple recursion from one cycle of updates to the next one, and to effectively decouple the parameter updates. The choice of a compactly supported orthonormal wavelet basis <ref> [5] </ref> is motivated by its excellent time-frequency localization, multi resolution, and the existence of efficient algorithms for computing the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) via discrete time filter banks.
