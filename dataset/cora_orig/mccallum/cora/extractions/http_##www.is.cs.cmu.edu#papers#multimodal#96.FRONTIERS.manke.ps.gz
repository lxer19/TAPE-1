Abstract: State-of-the-art on-line handwriting recognition systems should be able to handle dictionary sizes of at least 25,000 words or more to be useful for real-world applications. Using dictionaries of this size requires fast search techniques to achieve reasonable recognition times. In this paper we present a search approach yielding recognition times, which are virtually independent of the dictionary size. This approach combines a tree representation of the dictionary with efficent pruning techniques to reduce the search space without loosing much recognition performance compared to a flat exhaustive search through all words in the dictionary. The tree search with pruning is about 15 times faster than a flat search and allows us to run the NPen ++ on-line handwriting recognition system in real-time with dictionary sizes up to 100,000 words.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION During the last decade several systems with promising recognition performance for online handwriting recognition have been proposed <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. These systems differ in many ways: the kind of input (hand-printed, cursive, mixed handwriting), preprocessing (e.g. temporal feature sequences vs. bitmaps), and recognition techniques (separate vs. integrated recognition and segmentation). Systems making intensive use of temporal writing information and using integrated recognition and segmentation usually outperform other approaches. <p> The size of such a dictionary influences both the recognition performance and response time of the system and therefore also the degree of user acceptance. While even with dictionary sizes up to 100,000 words reasonable good recognition performance can be achieved <ref> [1] </ref>, response time of the system becomes an important problem. With dictionary sizes of 20,000 words or more an exhaustive search through the dictionary is no longer possible, if the system must come up with the answer in real-time. <p> The following section gives a short description of the NPen ++ system. Section 3 presents the search tree architecture and search techniques used in NPen ++ . Recognition times and results for different dictionary sizes are shown in Section 4. 2. THE NPen ++ SYSTEM NPen ++ <ref> [1] </ref> is a system for writer independent, large vocabulary on-line cursive handwriting recognition. <p> (w i jx L p (x L p (x L : Thus, instead of referring to p (w i jx L 0 ; ) directly the MS-TDNN is supposed to model the log-likelihood log p (x L 0 jw i ; ) of the pen trajectory using the following approximation <ref> [1] </ref>: log p (x L q L 0 l=1 The maximization is done over all possible sequences through the states of the word model.

Reference-contexts: During preprocessing this sequence of data points is transformed into a still temporal sequence of n-dimensional feature vectors x L 0 = x 0 : : : x L , which combine local information (e.g. writing direction or curvature) for a data point with so-called context bitmaps <ref> [3] </ref>, which are basically low resolution, bitmap-like descriptions of the coordinate's proximity. The NPen ++ recognition component integrates recognition and segmentation of words into a single network architecture, the so-called Multi-State Time Delay Neural Network (MS-TDNN).
