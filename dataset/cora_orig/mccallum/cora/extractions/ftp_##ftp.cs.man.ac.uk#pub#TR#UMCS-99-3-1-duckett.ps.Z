Abstract: This paper provides an overview of a three year project conducted on the subject of self-localisation and autonomous navigation by a mobile robot. The research was carried out in two stages: Self-Localisation. Due to the fundamental unreliability of dead reckoning, landmark-based methods were investigated. Several related issues were addressed, including performance evaluation, replication and comparison of existing work, and the development of a novel localisation system based on the results obtained. Autonomous Navigation. This work included the development of novel mechanisms for exploration and map building, as well as validating the previous work on self-localisation, in a complete, navigating mobile robot. Quantitative assessment of the different competences required for navigation was also carried out.

Reference-contexts: The ability to localise autonomously, i.e., using only the robot's own sensory impressions of the environment, is therefore desirable, and a wide variety of different mechanisms have been proposed towards this end (see Borenstein et al <ref> [1] </ref> for a detailed survey). <p> In particular, we concentrated on systems which determine their own landmarks, including self-organising neural networks, e.g., Kohonen, ART ([3]) and Restricted Coulomb Energy ([10]) networks, and self-detailing schemes, e.g., occupancy grids ([18]). An alternative would be to use human-defined landmarks (referred to as "natural landmarks" by Borenstein et al <ref> [1] </ref>) such as ceiling lights, doors, etc., but this approach can only be used in environments which contain the appropriate objects, and also suffers from the "correspondence problem" of matching sensor readings to the human-defined categories.

Of the systems considered in the study, we found that the highest level of localisation quality was obtained by the localisation mechanism developed by Yamauchi and Langley ([18]). Some example results are given in table 1.

Reference-contexts: One of the most popular approaches for topological navigation is that of hidden Markov models, and their extension to partially-observable Markov decision processes (e.g., Koenig and Simmons [8], Hertzberg and Kirchner <ref> [7] </ref>). Here, the robot maintains a probability distribution over a set of discrete locations, known as the robot's "belief". Similarly, landmarks and actions are typically defined according to a set of human-defined categories, e.g., possible landmarks might be `doors', `junctions', etc., and possible actions might be `North', `West', etc.

Reference-contexts: Some of these systems have been validated in real world environments, generally consisting of untreated, enclosed areas within public buildings (see e.g., Kortenkamp et al <ref> [9] </ref> for further information). Lack of space prevents a detailed review here; instead, we discuss the relative merits of some representative approaches.

Reference-contexts: location tracking is required in order to evaluate localisation quality. 4.2 Comparative Study of Landmark Recognition Systems In the traditional approach to self-localisation, a Cartesian position estimate produced using odometry is continuously recalibrated using sightings on known environmental features or "landmarks" previously encoded in the robot's map (see e.g., Lee <ref> [11] </ref>). The reliance on a priori knowledge of the robot's position means that this approach cannot solve the more general problem of global self-localisation, in which the robot must be able to relocalise even after becoming lost.

Reference-contexts: So far, navigating mobile robots have only been able to "close the loop" successfully by using accurate range-finding sensors and precisely corrected odometry (e.g., the system described by Thrun <ref> [15] </ref> has successfully mapped a circular route of 160m using laser range-finders and a high resolution metric map). However, this approach will inevitably fail once the size of the environment is increased beyond the limits of the robot's dead reckoning mechanism.

Reference-contexts: All computation was carried out in real-time on board the robot's 486 processor. 1 Middle-scale navigation involves leaving the sensory range of a `home' or `goal' location, and navigating within the wider environment <ref> [16] </ref>. In the case of our Nomad 200 robot, we mean navigation over several hundred m 2 . 2 An occupancy grid is a matrix representation of the robot's environment, where each cell contains a probability of occupancy.

Reference-contexts: Location recognition then consists of convolving the respective x and y histograms for the current sensor data with those stored previously in the map to find the best matching place (as in Weiss and Puttkamer <ref> [17] </ref>). Using histograms requires only a fraction of the storage and processing required to compare whole occupancy grids, with little or no loss in overall information content (see [6] for full details).
