Abstract: We analyze the complexity of verifying whether a given element is close to a solution element. Closeness is measured by two nonnegative parameters, " and ff. If ff = 0, then we get the strong verification problem which usually cannot be solved in the worst case setting, see Wozniakowski [90]. For ff &gt; 0, we have the relaxed verification problem which is studied in this paper in the worst case setting. We show that the ("; ff)-verification complexity is roughly equal to the -computation complexity, where = ("; ff). Under certain general assumptions we prove that ("; ff) = fi(" ff r ), where r depends on the problem norm, r 2 [0; 1]. We also show that adaption sometimes helps significantly.
