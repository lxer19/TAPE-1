Abstract: In networks supporting distributed multimedia, maximizing bandwidth utilization and providing performance guarantees are two incompatible goals. Heterogeneity of the multimedia sources calls for effective congestion control schemes to satisfy the diverse Quality of Service(QoS) requirements of each application. These include admission control at connection set up, traffic control at the source ends and efficient scheduling schemes at the switches. The emphasis in this paper is on traffic control at the source end. Traffic control schemes have two functional roles. One is traffic enforcement as a supplement to the admission control policy. The other is shaping the input traffic so that it becomes amenable to the scheduling mechanism at the switches for providing the required QoS guarantees. Studies on bursty sources have shown that burstiness promotes statistical multiplexing at the cost of possible congestion. Smoothing the traffic helps in providing guarantees at the cost of bandwidth utilization. The need for a flexible scheme which can provide a reasonable compromise between the utilization and guarantees is imminent. We present the design and performance study of a flexible traffic shaper which can adjust the burstiness of input traffic to obtain reasonable utilization while maintaining statistical service guarantees. The performance of the traffic shaper for bursty sources is studied using simulation.

Reference-contexts: These include naturally stream based sources which are also rendered bursty by the efficient compression and coding mechanisms employed. 4.2 Description of the Scheme The proposed traffic shaper which we will call Shift Register Traffic Shaper (SRTS) makes use of the temporal profile <ref> [Agr94] </ref> of the packet stream admitted by the shaper over the immediate past N time slots, where a time slot t refers to the reciprocal of the peak rate. This temporal history can be maintained by a shift register with 1 bit corresponding to every packet sent.

Reference-contexts: An allocation nearer to the peak rate allows for tighter probabilistic guarantees. In the extreme, with peak rate allotment, the guarantees can be deterministic. 2.2 Bursty Model and Bandwidth Requirement The source model used in this paper for measuring performance is the ON-OFF bursty model <ref> [SAG94, DYH93, BS91] </ref>. On-Off model is characterized by interspersed ON and OFF periods each exponentially distributed with mean T ON and T OF F respectively. During an ON period, cells are periodically transmitted at peak rate p (intercell time during an ON period is t p = 1= p ).

Reference-contexts: On the other extreme, average allotment may lead to buffer overflows and consequent losses/delays. No meaningful guarantees can be offered in such cases. An effective bandwidth, whose value lies between the average and the peak rate is determined for the various sources <ref> [GAN91] </ref>. An allocation corresponding to the effective bandwidth optimizes the network utilization and performance guarantees. An allocation nearer to the peak rate allows for tighter probabilistic guarantees.

Reference-contexts: Since the output stream is of an arbitrary nature unlike the input stream which is described by a bursty ON-OFF model parameters, we use ratio of Variance to Mean of cell interarrival times <ref> [SW86, HA87] </ref> for characterizing the burstiness. We will use the term `burst factor' for this ratio to , differentiate this definition of burstiness from the definition given in Section2.2.

Our scheme employs more than one window, which jointly provide a more general control over the burstiness of the input stream.
