Deering, </author> <title> "Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification", </title> <type> RFC 1885, </type> <institution> Digital Equipment Corporation, </institution> <note> Xerox PARC, </note> <month> December </month> <year> 1995. </year>
Reference-contexts: It also discusses packet size issues, the semantics of flow labels and priority, and the effects of IPv6 on upper-layer protocols. The format and semantics of IPv6 addresses are specified separately in [RFC-1884]. The IPv6 version of ICMP, which all IPv6 implementations are required to include, is specified in <ref> [RFC-1885] </ref>. Deering & Hinden Standards Track [Page 3] RFC 1883 IPv6 Specification December 1995 2. <p> IPv6 receivers must discard UDP packets containing a zero checksum, and should log the error. The IPv6 version of ICMP <ref> [RFC-1885] </ref> includes the above pseudo-header in its checksum computation; this is a change from the IPv4 version of ICMP, which does not include a pseudo-header in its checksum.

Reference-contexts: This document specifies the basic IPv6 header and the initially defined IPv6 extension headers and options. It also discusses packet size issues, the semantics of flow labels and priority, and the effects of IPv6 on upper-layer protocols. The format and semantics of IPv6 addresses are specified separately in <ref> [RFC-1884] </ref>. The IPv6 version of ICMP, which all IPv6 implementations are required to include, is specified in [RFC-1885]. Deering & Hinden Standards Track [Page 3] RFC 1883 IPv6 Specification December 1995 2. <p> Uses the same values as the IPv4 Protocol field [RFC-1700 et seq.]. Hop Limit 8-bit unsigned integer. Decremented by 1 by each node that forwards the packet. The packet is discarded if Hop Limit is decremented to zero. Source Address 128-bit address of the originator of the packet. See <ref> [RFC-1884] </ref>. Deering & Hinden Standards Track [Page 5] RFC 1883 IPv6 Specification December 1995 Destination Address 128-bit address of the intended recipient of the packet (possibly not the ultimate recipient, if a Routing header is present). See [RFC-1884] and section 4.4. 4. <p> Source Address 128-bit address of the originator of the packet. See <ref> [RFC-1884] </ref>. Deering & Hinden Standards Track [Page 5] RFC 1883 IPv6 Specification December 1995 Destination Address 128-bit address of the intended recipient of the packet (possibly not the ultimate recipient, if a Routing header is present). See [RFC-1884] and section 4.4. 4. IPv6 Extension Headers In IPv6, optional internet-layer information is encoded in separate headers that may be placed between the IPv6 header and the upper layer header in a packet.
Reference: [RFC-1191] <author> Mogul, J., and S. Deering, </author> <title> "Path MTU Discovery", </title> <type> RFC 1191, </type> <institution> DECWRL, Stanford University, </institution> <month> November </month> <year> 1990. </year>
Reference-contexts: It is strongly recommended that IPv6 nodes implement Path MTU Discovery <ref> [RFC-1191] </ref>, in order to discover and take advantage of paths with MTU greater than 576 octets. However, a minimal IPv6 implementation (e.g., in a boot ROM) may simply restrict itself to sending packets no larger than 576 octets, and omit implementation of Path MTU Discovery.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction IP version 6 (IPv6) is a new version of the Internet Protocol, designed as a successor to IP version 4 (IPv4) <ref> [RFC-791] </ref>. The changes from IPv4 to IPv6 fall primarily into the following categories: o Expanded Addressing Capabilities IPv6 increases the IP address size from 32 bits to 128 bits, to support more levels of addressing hierarchy, a much greater number of addressable nodes, and simpler auto-configuration of addresses.

Reference-contexts: From each link to which a node is directly attached, the node must be able to accept packets as large as that link's MTU. Links that have a configurable MTU (for example, PPP links <ref> [RFC-1661] </ref>) must be configured to have an MTU of at least 576 octets; it is recommended that a larger MTU be configured, to accommodate possible encapsulations (i.e., tunneling) without incurring fragmentation.
