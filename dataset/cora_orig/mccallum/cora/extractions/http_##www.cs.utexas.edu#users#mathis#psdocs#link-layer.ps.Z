Abstract: This paper describes the design and performance of a link-layer protocol for indoor and outdoor wireless networks. The protocol is asymmetric to reduce the processing load at the mobile, reliability is established by a combination of automatic repeat request and forward error correction, and link-layer packets are transferred appropriately during handoffs. The protocol is named AIRMAIL (AsymmetrIc Reliable Mobile Access In Link-layer). The asymmetry is needed in the design because the mobile terminals have limited power and smaller processing capability than the base stations. The key ideas in the asymmetric protocol design consist of placing bulk of the intelligence in the base station as opposed to placing it symmetrically, in requiring the mobile terminal to combine several acknowledgments into a single acknowledgment to conserve power, and in designing the base stations to send periodic status messages, while making the acknowledgment from the mobile terminal event-driven. The asymmetry in the protocol design results in a one-third reduction of compiled code. The forward error correction technique incorporates three levels of channel coding which interact adaptively. The motivation for using a combination of forward error correction and link-layer retransmissions is to obtain better performance in terms of end-to-end throughput and latency by correcting errors in an unreliable wireless channel in addition to end-to-end correction rather than by correcting errors only by end-to-end retransmissions. The coding overhead is changed adaptively so that bandwidth expansion due to forward error correction is minimized. Integrity of the link during handoffs (in the face of mobility) is handled by window management and state transfer. The protocol has been implemented. Experimental performance results based on the implementation are presented.

Reference-contexts: A well-known technique is Reed-Solomon codes, which can be used for error correction (positions unknown, as in byte-level FEC) or erasure correction (positions known) [LC83]. When the number of packets is 2 or 3, the diversity code <ref> [AIGM93] </ref> is more efficient in terms of the size of the field the operations are performed in. Again, with the advent of more complicated processing, FEC methods at the packet level are finding their way into data transmission.

Reference-contexts: AIRMAIL avoids this relationship and therefore the associated polling operation, waste of bandwidth, and delay. The Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) protocol has a data link-layer protocol known as Mobile Data Link Protocol (MDLP), based on HDLC and LAPD <ref> [CDPD93] </ref>. Although partially based on HDLC, MDLP operates in balanced mode, i.e., there is no asymmetry in the protocol. In addition, forward error correction 3 or precautions taken for handling mobility existent in AIRMAIL do not exist in MDLP.

Reference-contexts: This causes the recovery time of an error that occurs on a wireless channel to be long. Secondly, losses incurred on the wireless channel trigger the end-to-end transmitters to decrease the window size and increase the duration of the retransmission timers as observed by Caceres and Iftode in <ref> [CI93] </ref>. This leads to lower throughput and higher latency. Therefore, correcting errors at the link-layer in addition to end-to-end correction will result in better performance compared to only end-to-end correction.

Reference-contexts: Since MT does not send its status periodically and it does not have a timer, a timer is needed at BR to detect loss of packets. The concept of using a timer at the receiver was introduced in NETBLT <ref> [CLZ87] </ref>, although in the context of a transport protocol. Also note that BR sends its status periodically to MT, thereby incorporating redundancy in the error-prone medium. 3. MT retransmits the requested packets before transmitting any new packet.

Reference-contexts: However, there is evidence in the literature that a retransmission in the link-layer 2 does not always result in better performance owing to its complex interaction with end-to-end retransmission mechanisms <ref> [DCY93] </ref>. As stated above, the wireless channel has a variable bit error rate, which can be very high (10 2 10 3 ). In addition, the wireless channel has fixed bandwidth, but the transmission rate needs as well as the number of potential users are constantly increasing.

Reference-contexts: The combined effect of these events is that the magnitude of the received signal becomes Rayleigh distributed, which can become vanishingly small. The Rayleigh distribution is the cause of the name Rayleigh fading for this event. Such channels are closely approximated by Jake's model <ref> [J74] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In addition, forward error correction 3 or precautions taken for handling mobility existent in AIRMAIL do not exist in MDLP. A link-layer protocol for the IS-95 channel, named the Radio Link Protocol (RLP), was proposed in <ref> [K93] </ref>. RLP is a simple, lightweight protocol. RLP emphasizes end-to-end error control, and therefore is not fully reliable. It leaves part of error control to higher layers, e.g., TCP. It is based on a pure-NAK philosophy, i.e., it is success-oriented.

Reference-contexts: with small bandwidth, or indoor wireless LAN with large bandwidth, there is a growing need for new link-layer protocols to accommodate the specific properties of the wireless channel in an efficient way so that a wireless terminal with better performance, lower power, and smaller size can be designed (see, e.g., <ref> [KGBK78] </ref>, [LNT87]). In this paper we propose such a protocol. We envision a network architecture which has a wired network as its backbone with base stations on it acting as access points for the mobile terminals (Figure 1). Mobile terminals communicate through the base stations with other hosts.

Reference-contexts: For example, when a handoff occurs, the sequence numbers of the link-layer protocol in the mobile terminal and the new base station must be synchronized so that lost packets may be detected, and ordered data delivery may be provided to the higher layer protocol. In contrast to <ref> [KMSKF93] </ref>, where only real-time services are addressed, we aim for reliable data transfer; and in order to limit the amount of extra processing that must occur at the mobile terminal, we infuse the new base station with the state of the old base station so that no change is noticed at

Reference-contexts: As is well-known, FEC techniques are sometimes used in addition to the automatic repeat request (ARQ) techniques at the data link layer. Various combined techniques, known as hybrid techniques, have been suggested and studied for this purpose (e.g., see <ref> [LC83] </ref> and its references). Among the channels suggested for the use of hybrid ARQ/FEC schemes is the satellite channel and the high-speed ATM channel. In both cases, the packet size is large with respect to the propagation delay, or in other words, the bandwidth-delay product is high. <p> This technique is known as optimum erasure encoding-decoding (optimum in the maximum distance sense), and various coding methods can be employed for this purpose. A well-known technique is Reed-Solomon codes, which can be used for error correction (positions unknown, as in byte-level FEC) or erasure correction (positions known) <ref> [LC83] </ref>. When the number of packets is 2 or 3, the diversity code [AIGM93] is more efficient in terms of the size of the field the operations are performed in.

Reference-contexts: With error correction mechanisms at the link-layer, the heavy error correction overhead present in the physical layer of IS-95 can be avoided. Recently, a new point-to-point ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) protocol has been proposed for the radio channel <ref> [NED93] </ref> which exploits the sequential delivery of packets in a wireless link. However, it assumes circuit-mode data, while we assume packet-mode data. Further, [NED93] does not have any of the unique properties of our protocol, namely, asymmetry, adaptive forward error correction, and mobility management. <p> Recently, a new point-to-point ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) protocol has been proposed for the radio channel <ref> [NED93] </ref> which exploits the sequential delivery of packets in a wireless link.

Reference-contexts: Thus the intelligence in terms of maintaining timers, processing complex status messages and most importantly, making decisions resides in the base station. 2. The base station receiver sends its status to a mobile transmitter periodically, as in the SNR protocol <ref> [NRS90] </ref>. The justification for using periodic status messages is to reduce the dependence on the error-prone medium. <p> This bit is referred to as the e-bit in subsequent sections of the paper. 2. BR transmits status messages periodically to MT. This is similar to periodic state exchange in the SNR protocol <ref> [NRS90] </ref> except that state is not exchanged and that the status messages in this protocol do not contain information regarding how much buffer space is available in the receiver as in the SNR protocol. <p> This is equivalent to measuring the channel continuously and describing the channel state to the transmitter. It has a similar motivation to the periodic state exchange of the SNR protocol <ref> [NRS90] </ref>. The rate of these measurement messages is orders of magnitude smaller than the rate of power control messages (1 kb/s) for IS-95 digital cellular standard using CDMA. The small delay-bandwidth product of the mobile channel enables adaptation based on feedback.
