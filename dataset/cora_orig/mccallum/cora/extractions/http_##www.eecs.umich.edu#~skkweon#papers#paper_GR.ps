Abstract: With advance in networking technology and emergence of new multimedia applications, it has become important to support video applications on a multi-service network. In particular, providing a Video-on-Demand (VoD) service on an integrated services packet network has been drawing considerable interest. In this paper, we propose a new service category called the semi-real-time class for VoD-like applications and present the network control functions necessary for it. The semi-real-time class provides packet-delivery delay guarantees unlike the best-effort service class, but the guaranteed delay bound is much looser than that provided to the real-time class, thus enhancing network utilization. For the source traffic characterization necessary to support the semi-real-time class, we introduce a statistical traffic envelope evolved from the widely-used deterministic traffic envelope. The performance of our approach for servicing VoD applications is evaluated through an empirical study. Compared to the case of using real-time service, employing semi-real-time service for VoD applications is shown to significantly reduce the required bandwidth and buffer, thus enhancing network utilization greatly, at the cost of a relatively small percentage of packet losses. In one case, when the delay bound was set to 1.5 sec in semi-real-time service, a more than 300 % improvement in network utilization was observed compared to the case of using real-time service in which the delay bound was set to 33 msec. The work reported in this paper was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant MIP-9203895 and the Office of Naval Research under Grant N00014-94-1-0229.

In particular, the worst-case traffic-generation rate (i.e., peak packet-generation rate or minimum packet inter-arrival time), rather than the long-term average traffic-generation rate, plays a key role in the admission control. As a result, using the real-time service often leads to very low network utilization.

Reference-contexts: Selection of such a random process is critical in estimating the amount of resources necessary to achieve the given QoS, but no general solution to it has been reported thus far. In <ref> [7] </ref>, on/off periodic sources with uniformly-distributed independent phases were used to find the network behavior in the worst case. Each on/off periodic source is supposed to bound one of original traffic sources.

Reference-contexts: If the user-requested delay bound is small, the reserved bandwidth tends to be closer to the peak rate; this type of applications is said to be peak-rate-oriented . Conventional real-time applications fall in this category since they require per-packet delivery delay guarantees <ref> [8] </ref> which, in turn, entail admission control based on the peak packet-generation rate. Servicing peak-rate-oriented applications is resource-intensive and often leads to very low resource utilization when the source traffic pattern is bursty, or the ratio of peak packet-generation rate to average packet-generation rate is high.

Reference-contexts: Sequence 2 is used as the source traffic for the real-time class, and its average arrival rate is 0.169 Mbps. By setting the local link delay bound to 2 slots (66 msec), we can establish up to 50 connections using the admission test of the WFQ scheme <ref> [11] </ref>. The choice of this particular scheme for real-time communication is arbitrary and doesn't alter the conclusion drawn in this section. Since the aggregated average traffic arrival rate for the 50 sources is 8.496 Mbps, the network utilization is about 0.19. <p> When the number of connections 17 is fixed, the difference in the buffer required for loss-free transmission shows an order of magnitude improvement even with an extremely small loss tolerance, e.g., Z 1 = Z 2 = 10 9 . According to the definition of the GR service in <ref> [11] </ref>, up to 110 connections of Sequence 1 can be established over this 45 Mbps link. In that case, from Figures 8 and 9, the delay bound is 165 slots (5.5 sec) and the buffer requirement is 197.8 Mbits.

Reference-contexts: Note that ^ A (t ) is a time-invariant deterministic bound since it constrains the amount of source traffic over any time interval of length t . ^ A (t ) is also called the empirical envelope in <ref> [12] </ref>, or the minimum envelope process in [26]. Now, we can characterize the aggregate traffic behavior using each real-time connection's traffic envelope when multiple real-time connections are established over a link. Suppose real-time connections can be characterized by the envelopes ^ A m (t ); 1 m M .

Reference-contexts: Thus, we employ a traffic regulation scheme so as to preserve the source traffic characteristic at every intermediate node along the path of each connection. Guerin et al. <ref> [13] </ref> proposed the Guaranteed Rate (GR) service which motivated the semi-real-time communication service considered in this paper. They used a deterministic traffic envelope in order to provide the GR service.

Reference-contexts: On the contrary, the semi-real-time communication service overcomes this problem by allowing the network service provider to limit the allowable delay bounds as demonstrated in Section 5. Clark et al. <ref> [14] </ref> proposed the predictive service which shares some of its ideas with the semi-real-time communication service. However, their approach is based on the measurement of network performance to compute QoS parameters, and thus, does not provide any performance guarantee. Several researchers proposed constant-rate transmission of packets for VoD-like services [15-17].

Reference-contexts: Several researchers proposed constant-rate transmission of packets for VoD-like services [15-17]. Basically, their approaches require use of real-time communication service in an integrated services network or a dedicated transport system to guarantee a transmission rate. The approach in <ref> [15] </ref> may cause a large build-up delay and large buffer space at the receiver, depending on the characteristics of the transmitted VBR (Variable Bit Rate) video data. The approach in [16] can alleviate these problems by employing a smoothing technique.

When a bin becomes "current," all the packets in the bin become eligible for transmission and hence are transferred to the scheduler. The regulator is somewhat similar to the one used in <ref> [25] </ref>. The main difference is that packets generated in a slot share the same eligibility time.

Reference-contexts: Note that ^ A (t ) is a time-invariant deterministic bound since it constrains the amount of source traffic over any time interval of length t . ^ A (t ) is also called the empirical envelope in [12], or the minimum envelope process in <ref> [26] </ref>. Now, we can characterize the aggregate traffic behavior using each real-time connection's traffic envelope when multiple real-time connections are established over a link. Suppose real-time connections can be characterized by the envelopes ^ A m (t ); 1 m M .

Reference-contexts: However, our evaluation has shown this approach to be too pessimistic, due mainly to the conservative nature of the bounding approach in estimating the amount of traffic, as pointed out in <ref> [29] </ref>. Specifically, when the length of interval was even slightly large, the derived statistical traffic envelope was much bigger than the original deterministic traffic envelope.

Reference-contexts: Instead of employing the stochastic-bounding approach, we take a simple and direct approach based on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) <ref> [30] </ref>. This approach assumes existence of a trace of each source traffic, as in most VoD-like applications. For simplicity, we consider a 9 discrete-time (instead of continuous-time) version of a statistical traffic envelope.
