Abstract: We present a scalable VC routing protocol based on the recently proposed viewserver hierarchy. Each viewserver maintains a partial view of the network. By querying these viewservers, a source obtains a merged view that contains a path to the destination. The source then sends a setup request packet over this path to reserve resources. We use simulation to compare our protocol to a simple approach that maintains a full view of the network. In addition to the savings in storage, our protocol performs as well or better in terms of VC carried load and blocking probability over a wide range of real-time workload.

Reference-contexts: Our results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper. 2 Related Work In this section, we discuss VC routing schemes recently proposed for real-time QoS networks. 3 Most of these schemes are based on the link-state full-view approach described in Section 1 (e.g. <ref> [7, 1] </ref>). Generally, a cost function is defined in terms of the QoS information in the view. The route selection algorithm favors short paths with minimum cost. VC routing schemes based on the path-vector approach have also been proposed [14].

Reference-contexts: In Section 3, we present the view-query protocol for static network conditions, that is, assuming all links and nodes of the network remain operational. Due to space reasons, we omit the view-update protocol that handles topology changes and also the protocol specifications; they can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. In Section 4, we present our evaluation model. Our results are presented in Section 5. <p> The dynamic case is presented in <ref> [2] </ref>. Conventions: Each node has a unique id. NodeIds denotes the set of node-ids. For a node u, we use nodeid (u) to denote the id of u. <p> The cost equals 1 if the link is known to be down. The cost of a link changes with time (see <ref> [2] </ref>). The view also includes timestamp and expirytime fields which are described in [2]. 5 Not all the links need to be included. Viewserver Hierarchy For scaling reasons, we cannot have one large view. <p> The cost equals 1 if the link is known to be down. The cost of a link changes with time (see <ref> [2] </ref>). The view also includes timestamp and expirytime fields which are described in [2]. 5 Not all the links need to be included. Viewserver Hierarchy For scaling reasons, we cannot have one large view. Thus, obtaining a source route between a source and a destination which are far away, involves accumulating views of a sequence of viewservers. <p> Views of the five viewservers in the addresses are merged. The merged view contains paths from the source end-system to the destination end-system. Above we have described one possible way of obtaining the accumulated views. There are various other possibilities; see <ref> [2] </ref>. 4 Evaluation In this section, we present the parameters of our simulation model. We use this model to compare our viewserver-based VC routing protocols to the simple approach. The results obtained are presented in Section 5. <p> The fourth viewserver scheme is referred to as vertex-extension-QT. It is identical to vertex-extension except that during the query protocol all the viewservers in the source and the destination addresses are queried. 5 Numerical Results We studied several networks <ref> [2] </ref>. Here we present results for only one network, referred to as Network 1. The parameters of the topology are as given in Section 4. The link capacity C is taken to be 20 [7], i.e. a link is capable of carrying 20 VCs simultaneously. <p> Note that for all viewserver schemes, adding QT yields slightly further improvement. However this is not always the case <ref> [2] </ref>. 6 Conclusions We presented a hierarchical VC routing protocol for ATM-like networks. Our protocol satisfies QoS constraints, adapts to dynamic topology changes, and scales well to large number of nodes. In all the viewserver schemes we studied, each switch is a viewserver.

Reference-contexts: Our scheme In this paper, we present a scalable VC routing scheme that does not suffer from the problems of areas. Our scheme is based on the viewserver hierarchy we recently proposed in <ref> [4, 3] </ref> for large internetworks and evaluated for administrative policy constraints. Here, we are concerned with the support of performance/QoS requirements in large wide-area ATM-like networks, and we adapt our viewserver protocols accordingly. In our scheme, views are not maintained by every end-system but by special switches called viewservers. <p> Surprisingly, at high values of , all the viewserver schemes perform better than the simple approach. At = 0:5, the network with the base scheme carries about 30% higher load than the simple approach. This is an interesting result. Our explanation is as follows. Elsewhere <ref> [3] </ref>, we have found that when the viewserver schemes can not find an existing feasible path, this path is usually very long (more than 11 hops). This causes our viewserver hierarchy protocols to reject VCs that are admitted by the simple approach over long paths.

Reference-contexts: This requires a transport protocol support such as TCP [21]. To implement both kind of sends, we assume there is a reserved VC on each link for sending routing, signaling and control messages <ref> [5] </ref>. This also ensures that routing messages do not degrade the QoS seen by applications. Views and Viewservers Views are maintained by special nodes called viewservers. Each viewserver has a precinct, which is a set of nodes around the viewserver.

Reference-contexts: This VP concept has been proposed to achieve scaling and simplify network management and control. Typically, routing schemes that only consider paths with one VP and two VPs are used. However, it is not clear how to install VPs <ref> [9] </ref>. Also, the static allocation of resources to VPs can result in resource under-utilization and higher blocking probabilities [16]. One approach to solve this problem is to install fewer VPs and thus use longer paths (i.e. consisting of more than two VPs).

Reference-contexts: This reservation amount can be thought of either as the peak transmission rate of the VC or its "effective bandwidth" <ref> [13] </ref> varying between the peak and average transmission rates. VC setup requests arrive to the network according to a Poisson process of rate , each requiring one unit of bandwidth. Each VC, once it is successfully setup, has a lifetime of exponential duration with mean 1=.

The basic idea is to aggregate nodes hierarchically into areas: "close" nodes are aggregated into level 1 areas, "close" level 1 areas are aggregated into level 2 areas, and so on.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Integrated services packet-switched networks, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks <ref> [22] </ref>, are expected to carry a wide variety of applications with heterogeneous quality of service (QoS) requirements. For this purpose, new resource allocation algorithms and protocols have been proposed, including link scheduling, admission control, and routing. Link scheduling defines how the link bandwidth is allocated among the different services.

Reference-contexts: The use of long paths for VCs is undesirable since it ties up resources at more intermediate nodes, which can be used to admit many shorter length VCs. Observe that this produces the same effect obtained with the well-known "trunk reservation" mechanism <ref> [23] </ref>, giving priority to short length VCs over long ones. In conclusion, we recommend the vertex-extension scheme as it performs close to or better than all other schemes in terms of VC carried load and blocking probability over a wide range of workload.
