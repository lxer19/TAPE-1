Title: Optimal Routing Control: Game Theoretic Approach

Abstract: Communication networks shared by selfish users are considered and modeled as noncooperative repeated games. Each user is interested only in optimizing its own performance by controlling the routing of its load. We investigate the existence of a NEP that achieves the system-wide optimal cost. The existence of a NEP that not only achieves the system-wide optimal cost but also yields a cost for each user no greater than its stage game NEP cost is shown for two-node multiple link networks. It is shown that more general networks where all users have the same source-destination pair have a NEP that achieves the minimum total system cost under a mild technical condition. It is shown general networks with users having multiple source-destination pairs don't necessarily have such an NEP.

Reference-contexts: In fact, it is a SPNEP. One thing to notice about ~ f is that the cost of some users may be greater than their cost in the stage game NEP. Friedman in <ref> [1] </ref> showed that any cost vector that strictly Pareto-dominates a stage game NEP can be supported by a SPNEP for discount factors sufficiently close to 1.

Reference-contexts: In words, if other users collude to punish user i , it can guarantee that it incurs a cost no more than v i . Let v = (v 1 ; v 2 ; :::; v I ). The Folk theorem for repeated games <ref> [2] </ref> says that any cost vector that strictly Pareto-dominates v can be supported by an NEP in the repeated game for discount factors sufficiently close to 1. Let f denote the unique stage game NEP and J i the cost of user i at the NEP. <p> R C 0 ; 8 i 2 I, the existence of such NEP follows directly from Folk theorem because proportional sharing is strictly Pareto-dominated by the reservation cost vector <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> This means that the interior of V fl is nonempty in R I . We may show that any NEP of the repeated game is also a SPNEP of the game, by showing that the full dimensionality holds <ref> [2] </ref>. Theorem 4 There exists a SPNEP in the repeated game that achieves the minimum total system cost, C 0 . 3.1.2 Multiple Source-Destination Pairs Case: In this section we will discuss the case where not all users have same source-destination pair.

Reference-contexts: That is, we model the network as consisting of a collection of selfish users, each of which attempts to minimize its own cost. In the absence of collusion, this is a noncooperative game. An interesting recent paper along these lines is the one of Orda, Rom, and Shimkin <ref> [7] </ref>. Here a routing problem is analyzed in a static setting, namely as a single stage game, and the existence of NEP's for this routing problem is proved for certain types of cost functions related to the latency on the links. <p> Uniqueness of the NEP when the network consists of parallel links connecting a pair of nodes is also shown for these cost functions. In more general networks, uniqueness of NEP does not hold even for rather natural cost functions, and such examples are given in <ref> [7] </ref>. The agents in this routing game are naturally thought of as being the network access providers. <p> Since we are assuming that every user is selfish, the problem can be modeled as a noncooperative game where each user is trying to minimize its cost <ref> [7] </ref>. A natural question that arises in this type of setting is whether there is a Nash equilibrium of the game or not. <p> However, one problem with an NEP is that it is not necessarily very efficient. In fact, Korillis, Lazar, and Orda <ref> [7] </ref> give nu merical examples with natural cost functions where the difference between the total cost at the system-wide optimal point and that at the NEP could be more than 20 percent. In our analysis, we use what are called type-C cost functions in [7]. <p> In fact, Korillis, Lazar, and Orda <ref> [7] </ref> give nu merical examples with natural cost functions where the difference between the total cost at the system-wide optimal point and that at the NEP could be more than 20 percent. In our analysis, we use what are called type-C cost functions in [7]. <p> We will call i user i's marginal cost at the NEP. Orda, Rom, and Shimkin have proved in <ref> [7] </ref> that in the parallel link case with type-C cost functions there is a unique NEP. <p> For more details on the properties of stage game NEP's, refer to <ref> [7] </ref>. Unfortunately, in most cases where multiple selfish users compete over the network, the resulting unique NEP does not result in the same link flows as the systemwide optimal point. p. 2 2.2 Subgame Perfect NEP We now assume that the stage game of Section 2.1 is repeated. <p> Now, suppose that there exists no such l. Let L 0 be the set of links such that f 0 l &gt; 0. Then, C l is same for all l 2 L 0 <ref> [7] </ref>. We can show that ~ f is a stage game NEP. First, K i l is the same for all l 2 L 0 because both C l and ~ f i l are same on all l 2 L 0 . <p> We can think of flow on each link l used at the stage game NEP as a block, K l , of flow with an associated cost per unit flow, fi l = 1 C l f l , and amount f l . From <ref> [7] </ref>, this cost per unit flow is nondecreasing in l. We can create another set of blocks, J l , with the same amount, f l , filling up f 0 l ; l 2 L, in order of increasing l. <p> However, the uniqueness of the system flow configuration that achieves the minimum total sys tem cost is guaranteed by Theorem 5 in <ref> [7] </ref>. Therefore, the minimum total system cost, C 0 , and the corresponding system flow configuration are well defined. <p> R C 0 ; 8 i 2 I, then since any NEP of the stage game is Pareto-dominated by the reservation cost vector and the total system cost at the stage game NEP is no smaller than C 0 , there exists a stage game NEP that achieves C 0 <ref> [7] </ref> and the stage game NEP cost of each user equals its proportional sharing cost. Repeating the stage game NEP is a NEP in the repeated game.

Reference-contexts: Otherwise, at least one user with infinite cost can change its own flow configuration to have finite cost. It turns out that under these assumptions, the routing game is equivalent to a convex game described in <ref> [9] </ref>, and the existence of an NEP is guaranteed. Also, Kuhn-Tucker conditions constitute the necessary conditions for a feasible system configuration to be an NEP. <p> Again since we are faced with selfish users, we have a noncooperative game played by users that attempt to minimize their own costs. The first thing we investigate is the existence of an NEP in the stage game. The existence is guaranteed by the same result in <ref> [9] </ref> as in the parallel link networks. <p> Again the existence of a NEP is guaranteed by the result due to Rosen <ref> [9] </ref>. However, the uniqueness of the system flow configuration that achieves minimum total system cost hasn't been proved yet.
