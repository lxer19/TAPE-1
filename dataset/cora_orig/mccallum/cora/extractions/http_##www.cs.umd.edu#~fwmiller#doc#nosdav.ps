Abstract: An on-demand system for transmission of MPEG-1 video across Internet connections using a smoothing algorithm developed by Salehi, et. al. is presented. Experiments with this system transmitting video over Ethernet and ATM network hardware indicate the potential for higher playback rates in our system when smoothed transmissions are used.

Reference-contexts: Their focus to date has been mainly on throttling data transmission to use dynamically fluctuating network bandwidth as efficiently as possible. A distributed real-time MPEG player was developed by Cen, et. al. <ref> [1] </ref> that focussed on the design and performance of feedback mechanisms between the client and server to compensate for available bandwidth dynamically.

Reference-contexts: A distributed real-time MPEG player was developed by Cen, et. al. [1] that focussed on the design and performance of feedback mechanisms between the client and server to compensate for available bandwidth dynamically. The Vosaic <ref> [2, 7] </ref> project uses VDP to perform a similar feedback function but also addresses provision of continuous media, such as video, as elements in World Wide Web content. This work proposes an overall structure for delivery of continuous media through web browsers, including provisions for in-process control functions.

Reference-contexts: If video frames are transmitted during each period, implementation of functions such as rewind and fast forward are straightforward. However, smoothing may cause the data associated with a frame to traverse transmission periods which will complicate the implementation of these functions. The nv video conferencing application <ref> [3] </ref>, which is based on the MBONE IP-multicast Internet overlay, delivers continuous video and audio and so deals with the problem of transmission over the Internet. However, the smoothing algrorithm, as specified in [6] is not suitable for this application.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Video signals consume more network bandwidth than most other types of traffic. Making a bad situation worse are encoded videos, such as those utilizing MPEG <ref> [4] </ref>, that display variable bit rate (VBR) behavior. The summations of peaks in these streams can cause havoc with networks and end systems when videos are transmitted on-demand. For this reason, recent research has focussed on smoothing VBR streams to reduce their variance during transmission.

Reference-contexts: It is optimal in the sense that no other smoothing algorithm can generate transmission schedules that have less variance or lower peak rates. In some sense, these schedules are the smoothest that can be generated for a given client buffer size. The algorithm is presented in <ref> [6] </ref>. We have performed experiments with the transmission of the smoothed videos over Internet connections using both Ethernet and ATM network hardware. <p> The nv video conferencing application [3], which is based on the MBONE IP-multicast Internet overlay, delivers continuous video and audio and so deals with the problem of transmission over the Internet. However, the smoothing algrorithm, as specified in <ref> [6] </ref> is not suitable for this application.
