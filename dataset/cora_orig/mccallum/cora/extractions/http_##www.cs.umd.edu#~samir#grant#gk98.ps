Abstract: A fundamental facility location problem is to choose the location of facilities, such as industrial plants and warehouses, to minimize the cost of satisfying the demand for some commodity. There are associated costs for locating the facilities, as well as transportation costs for distributing the commodities. This problem is commonly referred to as the uncapacitated facility location problem. Applications to bank account location and clustering, as well as many related pieces of work, are discussed by Cornuejols, Nemhauser and Wolsey [2]. Recently, the first constant factor approximation algorithm for this problem was obtained by Shmoys, Tardos and Aardal [14]. We show that a simple greedy heuristic combined with the Shmoys, Tardos and Aardal algorithm [14], can be used to derive a better approximation guarantee. We discuss a few variants of the problem, demonstrating better approximation factors for restricted versions of the problem. We also show that the problem is Max SNP-hard. However, the inapproximability constants derived from the Max SNP hardness are very close to one. By relating this problem to Set Cover, we can prove a better lower bound on the best possible approximation ratio.

Reference-contexts: Recently and independently, Ko-rupolu, Plaxton and Rajaraman [6] have shown that the local search heuristic proposed by Kuehn and Hamburger [7] achieves a constant approximation for many variants of the UFL problem. Uncapacitated facility location (UFL) problems have been widely studied in the Operations Research literature (see <ref> [1, 7, 10, 15] </ref>). This problem has been studied from different perspectives, as clustering analysis [12], machine scheduling and information retrieval, communication networks [11] and many others. For an extensive survey of closely related work one can read the chapter by Cornuejols, Nemhauser and Wolsey [2]. <p> We wish to find an assignment of each location in D to an open facility so as to minimize the total cost incurred. This is the uncapacitated facility location problem (UFL). We can state the above problem as an integer programming problem as in <ref> [14, 1] </ref>. There is a 0/1 variable y i ; i 2 F indicating if a facility is open at location i.

Outline of Results It is easy to show that the problem is Max SNP-hard (Subsection 3.1).

Reference-contexts: We prove that if there is a polynomial time algorithm that approximates the problem to a factor better that 1:463 then N P DT IM E [n O (log log n) ]. This hardness result is established through hardness proofs for the set cover problem <ref> [9, 3] </ref> (Subsection 3.2). We also show that a simple and natural greedy "local-improvement" algorithm combined with the algorithm given by Shmoys, Tardos and Aardal [14] yields an approximation factor of 2:408. This algorithm and its proof are described in Section 4. <p> We present a scheme to produce much stronger lower bounds, based on the recent results on the hardness of approximating Set Cover <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.2 Improved Hardness Results We establish a relationship between the Set Cover problem and the UFL problem, and show that if there is a polynomial time algorithm for the UFL problem with an approximation factor smaller than 1:463 then we have a polynomial time approximation algorithm for Set Cover that <p> By Feige's <ref> [3] </ref> recent result, this implies that N P DT IM E [n O (log log n) ]. Consider an instance of Set Cover defined as follows: let the set of elements be X = fx 1 ; : : :; x n g. <p> &gt; (1 1 e fi i ), we get for each i, fi i &lt; ln 1 c i fi i c ln 1 c i for some c &lt; 1: ` X fi i c i=1 1 = c ln jXj for some c &lt; 1: By Feige's result <ref> [3] </ref> this implies that N P DT IM E [n O (log log n) ]. 2 The above lemma essentially argues that by picking fi times the number of sets in an optimal cover, we cannot cover more than c fi fraction of the elements.

B-Vertex Cover: Given a graph G = (V; E), with the degree of each node bounded by a constant B, find the minimum cardinality vertex cover. Theorem 3.1. The Uncapacitated Facility Loca tion problem is Max SNP-hard. We prove this result by reducing from B-vertex cover. <p> Theorem 3.1. The Uncapacitated Facility Loca tion problem is Max SNP-hard. We prove this result by reducing from B-vertex cover. Proof: The B-vertex cover problem has has been shown to be Max SNP-hard by Papadimitriou and Yan-nakakis <ref> [13] </ref>. We will show that a (1+ * 0 ) approximation algorithm for UFL implies a (1+*) approximation for B-vertex cover. Construct an instance of the UFL problem where the vertices of G correspond to facility locations, and the edges correspond to demand locations.

This algorithm and its proof are described in Section 4. In Section 5 we present a simple family of examples for which the "gap" between the integral and fractional solution for the LP formulation given by Shmoys, Tardos and Aardal [14] is a factor of 1:463. 1 2 The hardness results are proven assuming that the facility costs for locations in F are identical. In this special case when facility costs are uniform, we can improve the approximation ratio to 2.225 (Subsection 4.4). <p> Thus we demonstrate varying degrees of hardness and possible approximation factors for various variations of the basic problem. 2 Preliminaries In this section we discuss the basic notation used in the Shmoys, Tardos, Aardal <ref> [14] </ref> paper. We are given a set of locations N = f1; : : : ; ng and a subset F N of locations at which we may open a facility, and a subset D N of locations that must be assigned to an open facility. <p> We wish to find an assignment of each location in D to an open facility so as to minimize the total cost incurred. This is the uncapacitated facility location problem (UFL). We can state the above problem as an integer programming problem as in <ref> [14, 1] </ref>. There is a 0/1 variable y i ; i 2 F indicating if a facility is open at location i. <p> to X x ij = 1 for each j 2 D x ij y i for each i 2 F; j 2 D x ij 2 f0; 1g for each i 2 F; j 2 D y i 2 f0; 1g for each i 2 F Shmoys, Tardos and Aardal <ref> [14] </ref> derive an algorithm that is based on solving a linear relaxation of the above integer program, and rounding the fractional solution to an integer solution. <p> Let facility i serve a demand location j, iff x ij &gt; 0. For each demand location j, order the facilities that serve location j in increasing order of service cost c ij . We now outline the algorithm given by Shmoys, Tardos and Aardal <ref> [14] </ref>. For every ff, define N ff (j) as the set of facilities with the lowest service costs for j and serving j such that their y i values sum to at least ff. That is P i 0 P i 0 1 s=1 y s &lt; ff. <p> Since each open facility corresponds to disjoint N ff (j), the cost of facilities is at most 1 ff f . The service cost is at most P Define g (ff) = j d j t (ff; j) Thus the algorithm developed by the Shmoys, Tardos, Aardal <ref> [14] </ref> guarantees a facility construction cost of at most 1 ff f and a service cost of at most 3g (ff) c . Lemma 4.1. <p> In <ref> [14] </ref> a ff ; 3g (ff) approximation is used to give an algorithm with cost 3:16 times the optimal. Assume we have a bicriteria (a; b) approximation for the UFL problem. Assume that b 1 + f c . <p> + u 1 ff dff We can verify that for this value of c, and the related range of fl, the RHS is always greater than LHS. 5 Gap between Fractional and Integral Solution One immediate question that comes to mind on reading the paper by Shmoys, Tardos and Aardal <ref> [14] </ref> is the issue of the "gap" between the integral and fractional solution. They show that they can round a fractional solution to an integral solution by increasing the total objective function cost by a factor of 3.16. <p> Minimizing over fi the ratio is at least 1 + fl which exceeds 1:278 for fl = 0:28. 6.2 Upper Bound for uniform costs We need to modify the rounding scheme proposed in <ref> [14] </ref>. We define an LP in the same way as before. We can guess exactly how many centers the optimal solution picks. For every node j, order the facilities fig that serve node j in increasing order of service distance c ij . <p> We thank Randeep Bhatia, Moses Charikar, Rajeev Motwani and Yoram Sussmann for useful discussions.
