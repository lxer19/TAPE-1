Reference-contexts: These concepts and terms will appear frequently in the description of KnEd. While this section is necessarily brief, a more detailed discussion of KM can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 1.3.1 Introduction KM is a frame-based knowledge representation language that uses slot-and-filler structures [11]. Its basic representational entity is a frame. Each frame collects information about a concept (eg. an object or process) and records this information in the values of the slots of the frame. <p> Figure 1.5 is an example of this modified assertion. Unlike most other knowledge representation languages, KM allows the recursive nesting of its annotations. This recursion makes knowledge representation more convenient and helps to retain contextual information about the nested annotations <ref> [1] </ref>. Figure 1.6 demonstrates the manner in which value annotations are recursively nested. Nested annotations can also be frames. In this case, the nested annotation is called an embedded frame. <p> Code written by Suzanne McBride [7] on the TI-Explorers greatly expanded the functionality of the tree panes. It let the user have multiple tree roots and the user could expand individual nodes in the tree. It also provides an interface to Liane Acker's viewpoints <ref> [1] </ref>. Another lost feature that needs to be reimplemented is the capability for the user to draw knowledge maps. Knowledge maps are drawings of relationships between frames. The user first places the frames on the screen and then draws relationships between them.

Reference-contexts: The problem section defines a particular problem that was encountered by a user of KnEd. The solution section describes how the problem was solved. Another important aspect of the structured growth of KnEd is the user study that was carried out by Brad Blumenthal in 1990 <ref> [2] </ref>. His study pointed out several weaknesses of the KnEd interface and provided many excellent suggestions for improvements to KnEd. KnEd was initially implemented using Zetalisp on TI-Explorers. <p> What's needed is to only update the part of the display for which the frame has changed. Lastly, another user-interface study needs to be done. Not only have new features have been added to KM since the Blumenthal study in 1990 <ref> [2] </ref>, but there are several issues that are 35 36 still unresolved. For instance, the matrix in Table 2.1 needs to be evaluated to determine if the commands specified in the matrix are the ones used most frequently by the user.

Reference-contexts: Table 2.3 presents the keyboard commands for text panes. These keyboard commands were added to save the user from having to waste time relocating his/her hands between the keyboard and the mouse <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> This option is especially useful if the tree is large, since it can fit a large segment of the tree onto the screen at the same time. This keeps the user from having to depend too much on his/her Working Memory <ref> [3] </ref>. expanded puts the relation labels on the arcs, with an arc being drawn for each relation. expanded+ draws one arc for each relation. * Pretty Print this option is used for compact and expanded trees only. Figures 2.12 and 2.13 are examples of these two kinds of trees.

Reference-contexts: The systems whose interfaces are most similar to KnEd are the CYC [5, 13, 14] 1 , CODE4 [6], and KEATS <ref> [4, 9] </ref> systems.

Reference-contexts: But, this operation will only work for slots that appear locally on a frame. An additional mechanism is needed for displaying global information for slots that don't appear locally. The tree panes currently only display trees from one root. Code written by Suzanne McBride <ref> [7] </ref> on the TI-Explorers greatly expanded the functionality of the tree panes. It let the user have multiple tree roots and the user could expand individual nodes in the tree. It also provides an interface to Liane Acker's viewpoints [1].
