Abstract: This paper addresses the dynamics and control of direct drive robots with positive joint torque feedback. We analytically derive the system dynamics in closed form. Even though it is coupled and nonlinear in general, it is substantially simpler than the robot link dynamics. We also derive conditions on the robot configuration which result in linear dynamics. Motion control laws for both cases are proposed.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Direct drive motors simplify greatly the mechanical complexity of actuated joints by eliminating the transmission systems required with traditional electric actuators. In addition they permit accurate torque control at each joint, through eliminating backlash, compliance, and much of the friction incurred with gear transmissions <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. These properties are leading to an increasing popularity of direct drive motors in robots and manufacturing systems. <p> Once accurate torque production is achieved, accurate and high bandwidth control of direct drive robots still requires the compensation of the nonlinear link dynamics. Linearization methods can be applied, like nonlinear decoupling control [7], resolved acceleration control [12], or the computed torque method <ref> [2, 15] </ref>. These approaches depend on the precise knowledge of the robot parameters and of the possibly varying load, and perform poorly when the model is not accurate [2, 18].

In addition, the computation (9) requires only knowledge of the polar rotor inertias and joint friction, eliminating the need to know all the link parameters as well.

Reference-contexts: Kosuge [11] demonstrated experimentally the effectiveness of using joint torque measurements to compensate the nonlinear link dynamics of a SCARA-type direct drive robot. However, he noticed a torque disturbance on the rotors caused by the movement of the proximal joints, which is not detectable by the torque sensors. Hashimoto <ref> [8] </ref> applied this technique to a harmonic drive actuator where the deformation of the "flex-spline" is used to measure joint torque.

Reference-contexts: These properties are leading to an increasing popularity of direct drive motors in robots and manufacturing systems. In an effort to improve upon the torque-to-mass ratio and torque accuracy of previous designs, a new direct drive 3-phase synchronous motor, the McGill/MIT Direct Drive Motor, has been designed and constructed <ref> [9] </ref>. Our work on motor control with positive joint torque feedback is based on this actuator. The production of accurate torque, however, is complicated by the nonlinearity of the motor itself.
