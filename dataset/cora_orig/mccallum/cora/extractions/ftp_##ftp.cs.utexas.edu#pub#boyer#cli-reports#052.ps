Reference-contexts: The Boyer-Moore Logic We use the Boyer-Moore logic as a hardware description language and also as a hardware specification language. Here we introduce the Boyer-Moore logic and give several examples of its use. The Boyer-Moore logic <ref> [Boyer & Moore 88] </ref> is a quantifier-free, first-order predicate calculus with equality. Logic formulas are written in a prefix-style, Lisp-like notation. Included with the logic are several built-in data types: Booleans, natural numbers, lists, literal atoms, and integers.
