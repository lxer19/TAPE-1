Title: A TWO-GRID FINITE DIFFERENCE SCHEME FOR NONLINEAR PARABOLIC EQUATIONS  
Author: CLINT N. DAWSON CAROL S. WOODWARD AND MARY F. WHEELER 
Abstract: We present a two level finite difference scheme for the approximation of nonlinear parabolic equations. Discrete inner products and the lowest order Raviart-Thomas approximating space are used in the expanded mixed method in order to develop the finite difference scheme. Analysis of the scheme is given assuming an implicit time discretization. In this two level scheme, the full nonlinear problem is solved on a "coarse" grid of size H: The nonlinearities are expanded about the coarse grid solution and an appropriate interpolation operator is used to provide values of the coarse grid solution on the fine grid in terms of superconvergent node points. The resulting linear but nonsymmetric system is solved on a "fine" grid of size h: Some a priori error estimates are derived which show that the discrete L 1 (L 2 ) and L 2 (H 1 ) errors are O(h 2 + H 4d=2 + t), where d 1 is the spatial dimension. Keywords: error estmates, finite differences, mixed finite elements, nonlinear, superconvergent AMS(MOS) subject classification: 65M06, 65M12, 65M15, 65M55, 65M60, 35K55 1. Introduction. In this paper, we consider a finite difference scheme for the solution

Reference-contexts: Before analyzing the convergence of our two level method, we develop estimates of the expanded mixed finite element method with quadrature applied to a linear parabolic equation. Estimates for this method have been shown for linear elliptic equations in <ref> [1] </ref>. The estimates we derive show superconvergence of fluxes and pressures in discrete norms. We also bound the error in the time derivative of the solution. <p> We will also make use of the following lemma proven in Arbogast, Wheeler and Yotov <ref> [1] </ref>.

Before we show convergence estimates for this finite difference scheme, we show convergence for a related linear scheme. The arguments given below closely follow those of Arbogast, Wheeler and Yotov <ref> [1] </ref> except that we extend their work to time differenced time dependent problems. <p> Proof. Arbogast, Wheeler and Yotov <ref> [1] </ref> present a lemma which gives the desired P fl;n and ~ U fl;n above. <p> TWO-GRID DIFFERENCES FOR NONLINEAR PARABOLIC EQNS 9 We can now extend a corollary from Arbogast, Wheeler and Yotov <ref> [1] </ref> to give: For the ~ U fl;n ; P fl;n ; Z fl;n ; ~ Z fl;n and W fl;n in Lemma 3.4, there exists a constant C, independent of H, such that k ~ U fl;n ~u n k TM CH 2 ; t k TM CH 2 ; <p> Thus, by Taylor's theorem, the smoothness assumptions, and approximation properties of P H , k ~ Z fl;n d t ~ U H k TM C (H 2 + t + k ~ U fl;n ~ U H k T ):(49) By results from Arbogast, Wheeler and Yotov <ref> [1] </ref>, k ~ U fl;n ~ U n H k T CH 2 . <p> Proof. (Of Theorem 3.3) Results (26) and (27) have been proven by Arbogast, Wheeler and Yotov <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> These estimates for a full tensor use the inverse estimate and may be improved through the derivation of explicit L 1 estimates. The loss of convergence due to the boundary is shown for the expanded mixed method in <ref> [1] </ref>. The estimates derived in this paper use the inverse estimate to bound L 1 norms in terms of L 2 norms. As a result, our estimates may not be as sharp as possible.

Reference-contexts: We also bound the error in the time derivative of the solution.

This is the case we analyze here in the context of expanded mixed methods. However, our method does not require the inverse of the tensor K, and thus can be defined for the case of semi-definite K. This paper is organized into five sections. <p> Proof. Arbogast, Wheeler and Yotov [1] present a lemma which gives the desired P fl;n and ~ U fl;n above.
