Abstract: Knowledge tracking (KT) is an on-line method for learning individualized user competence models. A user model in knowledge tracking is a diagnostic profile that indicates which concept structure provides the best explanation of the data of a trace under study. A user model may be employed to provide feed-back to users who perform standard icon-manipulation tasks in human-computer interaction, e.g., by signaling that the concept structure used is not the optimal one. Since the user model is probability-based, concept structures are transformed into transition probabilities. The mechanism employed to learn user models is based on predictions of behavior in human-computer interaction. Quality of prediction is expressed by hit and error rates. These are taken to calculate the goodness of fit between the data predicted and the structures used for prediction. In this way, starting with a set of alternative and competing structures, the set of structures may be identified that allows for the best prediction of empirically observable behavior.

Reference-contexts: This result of this process is a set of concept structures. 4.1 Defining a Probabilistic Framework Having set up relational structures, the next major task is to transform each of them into probability distributions. The approach taken relies on a Markov process <ref> [Chu68] </ref>. We begin with a general definition for probability distributions. In the sections to follow, this definition will be adjusted so that the concept and the random structure may be expressed by transition probabilities.

Reference-contexts: The goal of this paper is to give an outline of knowledge tracking (KT), viz., a method for learning user models <ref> [Jan96] </ref>. Before we address some of the nitty-gritty details of knowledge tracking, we give a broad outline of this method. The overall purpose of KT is to learn the cognitive structures used by a problem solver, e.g., in human-machine interaction. <p> For each structure we receive different scores for goodness of fit. Statistical tests are performed on these scores to decide which structure fits and thus explains the data best (cf. <ref> [Jan96] </ref>). 4 Concept Structures In what follows, we describe the specific usage of concept structures in KT.

Reference-contexts: However, there are also differences between KT and EBG, most of which stem from the different types of data (examples versus traces). While EBG shares many of the intuitions of similar approaches to EBL (cf. <ref> [MCK + 89] </ref>), it became well-known since in EBG the concept of explanation has been clearly defined as a proof that a given concept is an instance of another concept. In KT, the corresponding question is whether a trace is an instance of a concept structure.

Reference-contexts: Goal: (C 0 ; R 0 ) number of concepts in the trace for which there is no full prediction base is m k since it varies according to the size of k. 5 This approach to learning introduced in this paper has much in common with explanation-based generalization (EBG) <ref> [TKKC86] </ref>, which is a particular form of explanation-based learning (EBL). Unlike knowledge-scant approaches, in particular inductive methods, EBG and also KT are knowledge-intensive methods used to accomplish deductive generalization.
