Abstract: The retrieval of images from a large database of images is an important and emerging area of research. Here, a technique to retrieve images based on appearance that works effectively across large changes of scale is proposed. The database is initially filtered with derivatives of a Gaussian at several scales. A user defined template is then created from an image of an object similar to those being sought. The template is also filtered using Gaussian derivatives. The template is then matched with the filter outputs of the database images and the matches ranked according to the match score. Experiments demonstrate the technique on a number of images in a database. No prior segmentation of the images is required and the technique works with viewpoint changes up to 20 degrees and illumination changes.

Reference-contexts: Some of the earliest uses of scale in matching go back to the Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids constructed by Burt and Adelson [Burt 83] and Crow-ley [Crowley 87]. These pyramids have been used to do coarse to fine matching under translation, affine or more general transforms (see <ref> [Bergen 92] </ref>). The pyramids speed up the computation as well as performing matching at the appropriate scales. However, as Lindeberg [Lindeberg 94] points out in his extensive discussion of scale space and its properties they do not form a true scale space.

Reference-contexts: The use of multiple derivative filters requires that correlation be performed between vectors. This is discussed by Gran-lund et al [Granlund 95].

The pyramids speed up the computation as well as performing matching at the appropriate scales. <p> This is the reason warping is required during VR matching across scales. On the other hand, the VR list approach should not be confused with pyramidal representations <ref> [Burt 83] </ref>. While pyramidal representations are also generated by filtering and sub-sampling images, there is an important distinction. Pyramids are generated as a translational search reduction mechanism for use in coarse-to-fine matching.

Reference-contexts: The first concerns matching with Gaussian derivative filters at multiple scales.

The use of multiple derivative filters requires that correlation be performed between vectors. This is discussed by Gran-lund et al [Granlund 95].

These methods all require knowledge of the contour or binary shape of the object. For specific objects like faces, principal component analysis has been used successfully for representation [Kirby 90] and retrieval [Turk 91].

By smoothing an image with Gaussians at several different scales Lindeberg generates a scale-space representation. While VR lists are scale-space representations, however, they differ from Lindeberg's approach in two fundamental ways.

Reference-contexts: These systems will respond to visual queries by retrieving images in a fast and effective manner. The application potential is enormous; ranging from database management in museums and medicine, architectural and interior design, image archiving, to constructing multi-media documents or presentations <ref> [Gudivada 95] </ref>. Simple image retrieval solutions have been proposed, one of which is to annotate images with text and then use a traditional text-based retrieval engine. While this solution is fast, it cannot however be effective over large collections of complex images.

Reference-contexts: It has been argued by Koenderink and others that the structure of an image may be represented using Gaussian derivatives [Koenderink 87]. Hancock et al <ref> [Hancock 92] </ref> have shown that the principal components of a set of images containing natural structures may be modeled as the outputs of a Gaussian and its derivatives at several scales. That is, there is a natural decomposition of an image into Gaussian derivatives at several scales.

The odd derivatives are all correlated with each other. This also holds true for the even derivatives which are correlated with each other. However, for the same , the first derivative of a Gaussian is uncorrelated with the second derivative of a Gaussian <ref> [Kass 88] </ref>. Thus picking only the first and second derivatives of Gaussians insures that maximal information is extracted from the image. Gaussian (as opposed to Gaussian derivatives) filters are not used because they are sensitive to the actual intensity value.

Reference-contexts: A single VR is the basic representation that can be used to retrieve images but, under a fixed scale. To retrieve images under varying scale a representation over the scale parameter is required and scale-space representations <ref> [Lindeberg 94] </ref> are a natural choice. Lists of VRs generated using banks of Gaussian derivative filters at several different scales form a scale-space representation of the object. This scale-space representation is used to retrieve objects under large (but not arbitrary) scale variations. <p> These pyramids have been used to do coarse to fine matching under translation, affine or more general transforms (see [Bergen 92]). The pyramids speed up the computation as well as performing matching at the appropriate scales. However, as Lindeberg <ref> [Lindeberg 94] </ref> points out in his extensive discussion of scale space and its properties they do not form a true scale space. Kass [Kass 88] used the Gaussian and its derivatives at multiple scales for stereo matching. <p> For the experiments carried out in this paper the scales of the filters used for both the query and database images are in the range [0:8 3:2] in steps of p It is instructive to note that VR lists over scale are scale-space representations in the sense described by Lindeberg <ref> [Lindeberg 94] </ref> and by [Granlund 95]. By smoothing an image with Gaussians at several different scales Lindeberg generates a scale-space representation. While VR lists are scale-space representations, however, they differ from Lindeberg's approach in two fundamental ways. <p> However, the relative scale between the query and the image is never known, forcing a true search across the scale parameter. As Lindeberg points out recursive application of filters and sub-sampling as is done in pyramidal schemes is not in general a scale-space representation <ref> [Lindeberg 94] </ref>. VR lists, which are not generated recursively, are proper scale-space representations and the matching occurs across scale-space. 5 Constructing Query Images The query construction process begins with the user marking salient regions on an object.

Reference-contexts: Kass [Kass 88] used the Gaussian and its derivatives at multiple scales for stereo matching. The notion of matching across Gaussians of different scales was used by Manmatha <ref> [Manmatha 94] </ref> for matching image patches under similarity and affine transforms. He also used the idea of comparing the outputs of Gaussians at different standard deviations to compute large scale changes. <p> In particular consider two corresponding points p 0 and p 1 and assume the image is Gaussian filtered at p 0 Then by substituting for I 0 using equation 3 we have: Z Z But it can be shown that G (r; ) = G (sr; s) <ref> [Manmatha 94] </ref>. <p> This is not a surprising result if the output of a Gaussian filter is viewed as a Gaussian weighted average of the intensity. A more detailed derivation of this res ult is provided in <ref> [Manmatha 94] </ref>. The derivation above does not use an explicit value of the scale change s. Thus, equation 5 is valid for any scale change s. <p> The form of equation 5 resembles a convolution and in fact it may be re written as a convolution I 0 (r) ? G (:; ) = I 1 (sr) ? G (:; s) (6) Similar derivations may also be carried out for higher derivatives of Gaussians (see <ref> [Manmatha 94] </ref>). Here the results for the first and second derivatives of Gaussians are listed.

Reference-contexts: Note that the first derivative of a Gaussian is a vector and the second derivative of a Gaussian a 2 by 2 matrix. Then the Gaussian derivatives are related by (see <ref> [Manmatha 93] </ref>) I s ? G (:; ) = I 0 ? G (:; s) (9) and, The above equations are sufficient to match the filter outputs (in what follows assume only Gaussian filtering for simplicity) at corresponding points (for example at p 0 and p 1 ).

Reference-contexts: The mean C M is in this case computed at (m,n) over a neighborhood in C (the neighborhood is the same size as S). Vector correlation performs well under small view variations. It is observed <ref> [Ravela 96] </ref> that typically for the experiments carried out with this method, in-plane rotations of up to 20 o , out-of plane rotation of up to 30 0 and scale changes of less than 1:2 can be tolerated. <p> It is observed that under reasonable queries at least 60% of m objects underlying the query are retrieved in the top m ranks. Best results indicate retrieval results of up to 85%. Several experiments were carried out with the database <ref> [Ravela 96] </ref>. The results of the experiments carried out with a car query, a diesel query and a steam query are presented in table 6. The number of retrieved images in intervals of ten is charted in Table 6. <p> Finally, for the diesel query there are 30 "similar" images, 12 of which are found in the top 20 retrievals. Due to space limitations only the results of the Car retrieval are displayed (Figure 4) and analyzed in detail (for the others see <ref> [Ravela 96] </ref>). The car image used for retrieval is shown in the top left picture of Figure 4. The objective is to 'obtain all similar cars to this picture'. Towards this end a query was marked by the user, highlighting the wheels, side view-mirror and mid section.
