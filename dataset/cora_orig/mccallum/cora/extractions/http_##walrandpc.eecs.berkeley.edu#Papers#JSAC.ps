Title: Resource Management in Wide-Area ATM Networks using Effective Bandwidths  
Author: G. de Veciana, G. Kesidis and J. Walrand 
Date: August 1995  
Note: in IEEE JSAC,  
Abstract: This paper is principally concerned with resource allocation for connections tolerating statistical quality of service (QoS) guarantees in a public wide-area ATM network. Our aim is to sketch a framework, based on effective bandwidths, for call admission schemes that are sensitive to individual QoS requirements and account for statistical multiplexing. We begin by describing recent results approximating the effective bandwidth required by heterogeneous streams sharing buffered links, including results for the packetized generalized processor sharing service discipline. Extensions to networks follow via the concept of decoupling bandwidths motivated by a study of the input-output properties of queues. Based on these results we claim that networks with sufficient routing diversity will inherently satisfy nodal decoupling. We then discuss on-line methods for estimating the effective bandwidth of a connection. Using this type of traffic monitoring we propose an approach to usage parameter control (i.e., policing) for effective bandwidth descriptors. Finally, we suggest how on-line monitoring might be combined with admission control to exploit unknown statistical multiplexing gains and thus increase utilization.

The salient feature of the PGPS service policy is its ability to "fairly" guarantee a particular minimum bandwidth to a given FIFO while being work conserving. This in turn permits differentiation in the QoS received by traffic streams.

Reference-contexts: As shown in Figure 1, switch output nodes are organized as parallel FIFOs which share the output link's bandwidth via a "packetized" general processor sharing (PGPS) service policy; see x2.2.2 and <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. The salient feature of the PGPS service policy is its ability to "fairly" guarantee a particular minimum bandwidth to a given FIFO while being work conserving. This in turn permits differentiation in the QoS received by traffic streams. <p> Best-effort traffic is allocated storage space and offered the left over (or "idle") bandwidth. In this context, PGPS is sufficiently flexible to distribute bandwidth "fairly" among the three categories and classes of traffic while being theoretically tractable for both the deterministic <ref> [2] </ref> and statistical [8] categories. At ATM transmission rates, the PGPS algorithm is somewhat complex to implement on a per-connection basis for thousands of calls [9, 10]. <p> The total link capacity is c cells/s. Under PGPS, the j th cell arriving to FIFO i (at time a i j ) is assigned a "virtual finishing time" (VFT) F i j . These VFTs satisfy the following recursion <ref> [2] </ref>: F i j+1 = maxfF i j ; v (a i 1 for all j 0 with F i where v is the "virtual time" function for PGPS. At each departure epoch, the cell with the smallest VFT in the node is chosen for service. <p> At each departure epoch, the cell with the smallest VFT in the node is chosen for service. The virtual time function of PGPS is derived from the evolution of a corresponding "GPS" policy so that the departure times under PGPS track those under GPS (Theorem 1 of <ref> [2] </ref>). The GPS policy is work conserving and has "fluid" dynamics so that each FIFO i receives service bandwidth proportional to i where 1 + 2 + ::: + n = 1. The following result, taken from [8], relates bandwidth requirements with QoS constraints in this system.

Reference-contexts: This in turn permits differentiation in the QoS received by traffic streams. ATM connections can be grouped into three categories based on their QoS requirements <ref> [3] </ref>: deterministic, statistical, and best-effort. There are several proposed approaches to handling traffic in an ATM network. One such approach is to regulate each non best-effort connection with a leaky bucket at the user-network interface (UNI). <p> Monitoring is also important if usage-based pricing is eventually implemented [17]. Our aim in this paper is to draw together recent work to give an overall picture of ATM resource management based on effective bandwidth traffic descriptors in the spirit of <ref> [3, 18, 19, 7, 20] </ref>. The picture is not complete, so we have endeavored to highlight future research directions. This paper is organized as follows: 2. Effective Bandwidth as a Traffic Descriptor for Admission Control 2.1. Traffic Descriptor and QoS Requirements 2.2. Bandwidth Allocation for Buffered Links 2.3. <p> In turn, routing algorithms rely on suitable "link metrics" [21] to establish possible routing options. Our focus herein, is on suitable "metrics," rather than the routing algorithms; for work on routing see <ref> [3, 22, 23] </ref> and references therein. 2.1 Traffic Descriptor and QoS Requirements The proposed traffic descriptor for a traffic stream is its effective bandwidth. It depends on both the statistical nature of the stream of cells and the nature of the required QoS constraint. <p> Similarly, a diversity of 5% should typically be in effect if traffic is fairly well distributed over the network by the routing algorithm. 2.3.2 End-to-End QoS Requirements We now address nodal decomposition of QoS requirements <ref> [3, 20] </ref>; i.e., the relationship between the constraint of Equation (2) and the end-to-end QoS requirement of a connection. In order to answer these questions, we unfortunately must resort to over-simplifications.

Reference-contexts: Best-effort traffic, such as electronic mail and file transfers, can be buffered both at the network edge and at PGPS nodes within the network without excessively degrading service; other buffering options are discussed in <ref> [7] </ref>. The best-effort FIFOs receive service when buffers handling deterministic and statistical traffic types are idle. Congestion in FIFOs handling best-effort traffic might be avoided by using higher layer end-to-end protocols; e.g., feedback protocols or window flow control. <p> Monitoring is also important if usage-based pricing is eventually implemented [17].

Reference-contexts: Even in this case, the advantage of PGPS over a simple priority service discipline depends on the characteristics of the traffic and the range of QoS requested <ref> [11] </ref>. <p> In addition, the expression in Equation (6) for the spare capacity of a PGPS node is conservative in and of itself though, experimentally, it appears to be quite reasonable <ref> [11] </ref>. The second underlying approximation in the previous sections has been that the network reaches steady state: the quasi-static approximation. If connection durations are not sufficiently long then the quasi-static approximation may not be accurate.

Reference-contexts: Hereafter we focus on ATM resource management for traffic tolerating statistical QoS guarantees using large network buffers; e.g., real-time traffic along paths with small propagation delay (i.e., tolerating large queueing delays) and, possibly, available bit-rate (ABR) traffic that requires a non-zero minimum service bandwidth and can tolerate some cell loss <ref> [12] </ref>. <p> Indeed, if ffi i is the smallest "policed" ffi for which a violation has been detected, then R could be set to fi (ffi i ). Although this approach to usage parameter control is complex, we propose its use for policing aggregations of streams as suggested in <ref> [12] </ref>. Because this effective bandwidth policier is difficult to analyze, we now give some simulation results to indicate its performance.

We chose ffi = 2. Using the formula for the effective bandwidth given in <ref> [24] </ref> and [25] (Section III.B), we get that ff (ffi) = 26:8. The parameter of our traffic monitor was taken to be B 1 = 2. We simulated the regulator with fi (ffi) = 25, i.e., the source is in violation.

Reference-contexts: the superposition of N independent sources with effective bandwidths ff 1 ; :::; ff N , defined as in (4) for the individual packet streams A i (t). 4 The peak rate of a traffic stream is well defined for fluid models, however it requires careful definition for slotted arrivals <ref> [28] </ref>. 4 The following result follows directly from Equations (2-4) and the independence of the arrival streams: N X ff i (ffi) &lt; c , lim B 1 log PfX &gt; Bg ffi; or alternatively, PfX &gt; Bg = exp [BI (c) + o (B)] where I 1 (ffi) := N <p> Below we discuss extensions to wide-area networks and consider end-to-end QoS requirements. 2.3.1 Nodal Decoupling In order to apply single buffer results in the network context, we need to ensure that the effective bandwidths of streams traversing a network are preserved. In <ref> [28] </ref> constraints ensuring that this is indeed the case are considered. The decoupling bandwidth of a stream, denoted by ff fl () , is the service rate required to ensure that the characteristics, ff (), of that stream remain unchanged. <p> A network with routing diversity is one in which the proportion of bandwidth allocated to traffic sharing similar routes (i.e., virtual paths) is small relative to the typical link capacity. A conservative rule of thumb for guaranteeing decoupling in a network is derived in <ref> [28] </ref> suggesting that decoupling is in effect when no more than 5% of the streams at a given buffer also share another downstream buffer. These results are proposed and supported by simulations in [36].

Reference-contexts: Thus, to first order, the effective bandwidth is the minimum bandwidth required by the connection to accommodate its desired ffi-constraint. If the effective bandwidth characteristic is not known apriori, the user can select an "envelope" effective bandwidth from a collection provided by the network <ref> [29] </ref>. For example, the envelope effective bandwidth for voice would be the "worst-case" measured effective bandwidth characteristic for actual voice sources. Resulting resource allocation based on envelope effective bandwidths would be conservative but would simplify resource management by limiting the number of traffic types.

Reference-contexts: Notice that for some applications it may be necessary to consider the manner in which excessive delays or cell loss occur, i.e., in clumps or spread out. Further research on more detailed QoS requirements that are easily and accurately "decomposed" is required <ref> [37] </ref>. Constraints on Cell Loss Probability: Assume that a connection requires that the cell loss probability, F , it experiences in the ATM network must satisfy F &lt; * t 1. <p> In <ref> [37] </ref> an argument is made that for stringent end-to-end loss constraints, a non-uniform distribution of loss among nodes does not significantly improve "performance." Let B i be the size of the buffer at node i in cells.

Reference-contexts: Cells that experience a delay of more than ED + T are essentially lost as far as the receiver is concerned while cells that are delayed less than ED T can be buffered at the receiver. It was argued in <ref> [38] </ref> that "the end-to-end delay jitter is in the range of the maximum transfer time of one node." Intuitively this corresponds to the idea that there is a bottleneck node which determines the end-to-end performance.

Reference-contexts: Note that expressions for maximum and minimum end-to-end delay can be obtained in terms of the virtual circuit's propagation and processing delays and the total amount of buffer memory (i.e., maximum queueing delay) while the dimensioning of "playback" (receive) buffers is related back to delay jitter characteristics of the stream <ref> [39] </ref>. 2.4 On Accuracy and Relaxing Stationarity Assumptions The expressions for the spare capacity based on effective bandwidth are typically conservative (recall that only the first order exponential characteristics of the tail distribution are considered).

Reference-contexts: Indeed, for buffers shared by large numbers of streams, it has been shown that additional statistical multiplexing gains are obtained which are not captured by the effective bandwidth approximation <ref> [40] </ref>. To account for this, one must resort to refined asymptotics such as [41, 15] or combine effective bandwidth results with zero-buffer approximations as in [18]. <p> This transpires from the following series of approximations P (X &gt; B) A exp [IB] exp [IB]; that is, not only do we approximate the tail with a single exponential term, but we take the leading constant A = 1. A convincing argument is made in <ref> [40] </ref> that the leading constant A may in fact be quite small or large, reflecting important characteristics of multiplexing. In general for heterogeneous systems, a precise analysis of the leading constant appears to be prohibitive, and can render management based on effective bandwidths inefficient.
