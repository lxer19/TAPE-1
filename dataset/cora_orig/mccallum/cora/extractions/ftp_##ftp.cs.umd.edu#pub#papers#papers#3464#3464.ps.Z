Abstract: Remotely sensed imagery has been used for developing and validating various studies regarding land cover dynamics such as global carbon modeling, biogeochemical cycling, hydrological modeling, and ecosystem response modeling. However, the large amounts of imagery collected by the satellites are largely contaminated by the effects of atmospheric particles through absorption and scattering of the radiation from the earth surface. The objective of atmospheric correction is to retrieve the surface reflectance (that characterizes the surface properties) from remotely sensed imagery by removing the atmospheric effects. Atmospheric correction has been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of image classification.

Reference-contexts: The TM data have been widely used for resource inventory, environmental monitoring, and a variety of other applications <ref> [1] </ref>. Since 1979, the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR) on board of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) series of satellites have been in continuous polar orbit. <p> AVHRR has allowed us for the first time to improve our studies of the earth surface from the regional scale to the global scale using remote sensing techniques <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. The radiation from the earth surface, which highly characterizes surface inherent properties, are largely contaminated by the atmosphere.

Reference-contexts: The combined atmospheric effects due to scattering and absorption are wavelength dependent, vary in time and space, and depend on the surface reflectance and its spatial variation <ref> [3] </ref>. For TM band 1, it is likely that the aerosol contribution is of the order of 50% even for relatively clear sky conditions.

Reference-contexts: The radiative transfer theory is used for this purpose. Assuming that the atmosphere is bounded by a Lambertian surface (i.e., reflects solar energy isotropi-cally), the upward radiance at the top of the cloud-free, horizontally homogeneous atmosphere can be expressed by <ref> [6] </ref> : L m = L 0 + (1 s) where L 0 is the upward radiance of the atmosphere with zero surface reflectance, often called path radiance, F d is the downward flux (total integrated irradiance) at the ground, T is the transmittance from the surface to the sensor (the <p> Given the aerosol optical depth, the determination of L 0 , F d , T , and s in Eqn. (1) is not a simple task due to the fact that these quantities are related to the solutions of the radiative transfer equation <ref> [6] </ref>, which is an integro-differential equation from which no analytical solution is available. There are a couple of approaches for obtaining practical solutions. The first is to use a numerical iterative approach, such as the discrete-ordinate algorithm [11], and the Gauss-Seidel algorithm [12].

Reference-contexts: The estimation of the atmospheric optical properties from imagery itself is the only way for operational atmospheric correction. One of the main parameters needed for TM and AVHRR imagery is the aerosol optical depth, which is defined as t = ln T . The so-called "dark object" <ref> [7] </ref> approach is used for this study. The idea behind this approach is quite simple.

Reference-contexts: The so-called "dark object" [7] approach is used for this study. The idea behind this approach is quite simple. We search for pixels with low surface reflectance using TM band 7 <ref> [8] </ref> (or AVHRR band 3 [9, 10]) in which aerosol effect is very small, and then we assign a small surface reflectance to those dark pixels and the aerosol optical depth can be figured out from Eqn.

Reference-contexts: First, the optical characteristics of the atmosphere are estimated either by using special features of the ground surface or by direct measurements of the atmospheric constituents <ref> [10] </ref> or by using theoretical models. Various quantities related to the atmospheric correction can then be computed by the radiative transfer algorithms given the atmospheric optical properties. <p> The so-called "dark object" [7] approach is used for this study.

These approximation algorithms are computationally efficient, but the accuracy is limited. An alternative is to set up off-line look-up tables <ref> [15] </ref> for certain input values. With the additional tables, the quantities (L 0 , F d , T , and s) can be efficiently calculated with high accuracy using interpolations. <p> This approach has been followed in this study and is referred to as the look-up table approach. 4 2.2 Why High Performance Computing (HPC)? The existing code <ref> [15] </ref> for atmospheric correction based on the look-up table approach processes one pixel at a time (and meant to be used interactively), and takes 2.63 seconds to correct a single pixel on a SPARC-10 machine, excluding I/O. <p> Each band requires about 20M B and the resolution is 8Km. Each AVHRR image covers the entire globe. 3 Atmospheric Correction Algorithm 3.1 Description of Algorithm A direct implementation of an atmospheric correction algorithm based on the lookup table approach has been described in <ref> [15] </ref>, where a Fortran version is given. The overall algorithm can be sketched as follows. Algorithm (Atmospheric Correction) 5 Input: N pixel values with the following information for each pixel: measurement wavelength, atmospheric correction parameters, location information and the day of measurement. <p> Second, we perform a linear or a nonlinear interpolation depending on the outcome of the first substep. 3.2 Implementation The direct atmospheric correction algorithm has been coded in Fortran <ref> [15] </ref> and tested on about 20 pixels. It uses eight look-up tables, one table for each of the 2 AVHRR bands of 0.639 and 0.845 m and one for each of the 6 TM bands of 0.486, 0.587, 0.663, 0.837, 1.663 and 2.189 m. <p> Table 1 shows the performance of our atmospheric correction algorithm, for different window sizes and for different types of input data. The execution times do not include I/O time and are obtained on a SPARC-10 machine. Clearly, the new code is substantially faster than the code in <ref> [15] </ref> and can be used to correct all 5 bands of a TM image covering an area of size 180km fi 180km with a window size of 19 fi 19 in less than 13 minutes on a SPARC-10 machine (excluding I/O). <p> Second, 9 we can skip some of the interpolations for TM data, such as those for observation angles. It should be mentioned that the input for our code is raw data and does not need any preprocessing, while the input for the code <ref> [15] </ref> is formatted and needs another program to transform the raw data into the special formatted input. 5 Parallel implementation Atmospheric correction of global data sets requires the extensive handling of large amounts of data residing in external storage, and hence the optimization of the I/O time must be considered in <p> Acknowledgment We thank Dr. Alan Sussman for helping us in using multiblock PARTI library. Ms. Shana Mattoo provided the original NASA code described in <ref> [15] </ref> and have answered many of our questions regarding the atmospheric correction algorithm based on lookup tables. Her help is greatly appreciated. Also, thanks to Professor Ralph Dubayah for providing comments regarding this project.
