Title: Reading Between the Lines: Using SHOE to Discover Implicit Knowledge from the Web

Abstract: This paper describes how SHOE, a set of Simple HTML Ontological Extensions, can be used to discover implicit knowledge from the WorldWide Web (WWW). SHOE allows authors to annotate their pages with ontology-based knowledge about page contents. In previous papers, we discussed how the semantic knowledge provided by SHOE allows users to issue queries that are much more sophisticated than keyword search techniques, including queries that require retrieval of information from many sources. Here, we expand upon this idea by describing how SHOEs ontologies allow agents to understand more than what is explicitly stated in Web pages through the use of context, inheritance and inference. We use examples to illustrate the usefulness of these features to Web agents and query engines.

Reference-contexts: However, the heterogeneity of the Web requires that a multitude of custom wrappers must be developed, and it is possible that important relationships cannot be extracted from the text based solely on the structure of the document. Semiautomatic generation of wrappers <ref> (Ashish and Knoblock 1997) </ref> is a promising approach to overcoming the first problem, but is limited to data that has a recognizable structure. The projects most similar to SHOE are creating languages to help machines process and understand Web documents.

Reference-contexts: The Resource Description Framework (RDF) (Lassila and Swick 1998) is a work in progress by the WorldWide Web Consortium (W3C). RDF is similar in concept to SHOE, but has few inferential capabilities and is limited to binary relations. The Web Analysis and Visualization Environment (WAVE) project <ref> (Kent and Neuss 1995) </ref> has designed the Ontology Markup Language (OML) and Conceptual Knowledge Markup Language (CKML), both of which are in part based on SHOE.

Reference-contexts: Related Work HTML 2.0 (Berners-Lee and Connolly 1995) includes several weak mechanisms for semantic markup (the REL, REV and CLASS subtags and the META tag). HTML 3.0 <ref> (Ragget 1995) </ref> advances these mechanisms somewhat. Unfortunately, the semantic markup elements of HTML have so far been used primarily for document meta-information (such as declared keywords) or for hypertext-oriented relationships (like abstract or table of contents). Furthermore, relationships can only be established along hypertext links (using &lt;LINK&gt; or <A>).
