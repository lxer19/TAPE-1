Abstract: We investigate the relationship between two epistemic nonmonotonic formalisms: autoepistemic logic and introspective circumscription. Finitely axiomatized autoepistemic theories are shown to be equivalent to the propositional case of introspective circumscription. This theorem is applied to the problem of relating the usual "minimizing" circumscription to autoepistemic logic.

Reference-contexts: Defining a declarative semantics of negation as failure has been long considered an important problem in the theory of logic programming.

A simple alternative proposed in [ Gelfond, 1987 ] was to view negation as failure as the combination :B, where B is the belief operator of autoepistemic logic. From this perspective, logic programs are merely a special kind of autoepistemic theories.

Reference-contexts: Introspective circumscription is not restricted to the propositional case|its definition applies to formulas with quantifiers and equality, and even higher-order quantification does not require any special treatment. For comparison, note that the available approaches to the problem of incorporating quantifiers in autoepistemic logic| <ref> [ Konolige, 1989 ] </ref> and [ Levesque, 1990 ] |tackle the difficult issue of "quantifying-in" in different ways, and there are varying opinions on what the "correct" definition of predicate autoepistemic logic should look like. <p> For instance, a nonmodal formula is entailed by the theory from Example 4 iff it is entailed by the circumscription of P 1 , with P 2 fixed, in P 1 _ P 2 . This corollary is similar to Theorem 3.5 from <ref> [ Konolige, 1989 ] </ref> . Our representation of the fixed symbols is somewhat different from his. Also, Konolige's theorem is about a first-order extension of autoepistemic logic and thus is not restricted to the propositional case. Similar results can be established for prioritized circumscription.

Introspective circumscription, like autoepistemic logic, formalizes the idea of introspection, but in a very different way. Just as McCarthy's original "minimizing" form of circumscription, it is not really a nonmonotonic logic, but rather a syntactic transformation of classical formulas. <p> In this way, we prove results similar to those established by Konolige [1989]. 2 Review of Autoepistemic Logic The treatment of autoepistemic logic in this note follows <ref> [ Lifschitz and Schwarz, 1993 ] </ref> , and is based on the ideas of [ Moore, 1984 ] , [ Levesque, 1990 ] and [ Schwarz, 1992 ] .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between two epistemic nonmonotonic formalisms: autoepistemic logic [ Moore, 1985 ] and introspective circumscription <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1989 ] </ref> . In recent years, we have seen renewed interest in autoepistemic logic, due primarily to its interaction with the concerns of the logic programming community. Defining a declarative semantics of negation as failure has been long considered an important problem in the theory of logic programming. <p> This cor-respondence was first described in the preliminary version of this note (authored by Gelfond and Przymusinska) and proved by a different method, not based on the use of models. A special case was proved in <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1989 ] </ref> , Section 5.3; the possibility of a generalization is mentioned there, but the exact statement has remained unpublished until now. Since minimizing circumscription is a special case of the introspective version, our theorem can be applied to the problem of relating minimizing circumscription to autoepistemic logic. <p> As defined in <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1989 ] </ref> , it is a syntactic transformation of second-order formulas. Since we are interested here in the propositional case of introspective circumscription, the only quantifiers that are needed are quantifiers over propositional variables. <p> the theory of Example 2 entails, among others, the formulas P 1 _ P 2 , :P 1 _ :P 2 , BP 1 :P 2 and BP 2 P 2 ; those are the conjunctive terms of the formula obtained in Example 4. 6 Minimizing Circumscription As shown in <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1989 ] </ref> , Section 4, introspective circumscription includes many forms of the traditional minimizing circumscription as special cases. <p> ^ (P 1 BP 1 ) ^ : : : ^ (P k BP k ) ^ (P k+1 BP k+1 ) ^ : : : ^ (P l BP l ): Specifically, if this formula is denoted by ~ A (P; BP ), then, according to Proposition 4 from <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1989 ] </ref> , ~ A fl (P; BP ) can be written as the conjunction of A c (P ) with explicit definitions of the propositional symbols BP in terms of the remaining propositional symbols P . <p> We would like to minimize P 1 and P 2 , with P 1 given a higher priority; let the result of this circumscription be A pc (P 1 ; P 2 ). According to Proposition 5 from <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1989 ] </ref> , the introspective circumscription of A (P 1 ; P 2 ) ^ (P 1 BP 1 ) ^ ((P 1 BP 1 ) (P 2 BP 2 )) is equivalent to A pc (P 1 ; P 2 ) ^ (BP 1 P 1 ) ^

A set E of autoepistemic formulas is said to be a stable expansion of T if the set of formulas derivable in classical propositional logic from T [ fBG : G 2 Eg [ f:BG : G =2 Eg equals E <ref> [ Moore, 1985 ] </ref> . The relationship between stable expansions and autoepis-temic models is quite simple: E is a stable expansion of T iff E = fF : for each I 2 S; (I; S) j= F g for some autoepistemic model S of T .

Reference-contexts: Without loss of generality, we can restrict attention to the formulas in which B is applied to atoms only; indeed, other occurrences of B can be eliminated by introducing explicit definitions ( <ref> [ Schwarz and Truszczynski, 1992 ] </ref> , Theorem 4.2).
