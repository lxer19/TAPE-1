Title: Viewing Morphology as an Inference Process

Abstract: Morphology is the area of linguistics concerned with the internal structure of words. Information Retrieval has generally not paid much attention to word structure, other than to account for some of the variability in word forms via the use of stemmers. This paper will describe our experiments to determine the importance of morphology, and the effect that it has on performance. We will also describe the role of morphological analysis in word sense disambiguation, and in identifying lexical semantic relationships in a machine-readable dictionary. We will first provide a brief overview of morphological phenomena, and then describe the experiments themselves.

Reference-contexts: There is also psychological evidence that inflectional variants are processed differently by the brain than derivational variants; derivational variants appear to be stored as a whole in the mental lexicon, but inflectional variants are processed dynamically ([Aichison 88], <ref> [Badecker and Caramazza 89] </ref>). We took a conservative approach to derivational variants and only stem them if we could show that they were related to the meaning of the root form.

Reference-contexts: from these problems as much as other languages (e.g., Hungarian or Hebrew, which may have thousands of 0 variants on any given word; experiments with a He-brew retrieval system have shown that a failure to process morphological variants resulted in retrieving only 2%-10% of the documents retrieved with such processing <ref> [Choueka 92] </ref>). 1 However, even in English, retrieval based on conflating word forms leads to significant improvements in performance. Such conflation, which is the norm in IR systems, is referred to as `stemming'. Stemming can be viewed from several different perspectives.

Reference-contexts: This indicates a reference to sense 1 of the first homograph. Zero-affix morphology is also present implicitly, and we conducted an experiment to try to identify instances of it using a probabilistic tagger <ref> [Church 88] </ref>. The hypothesis is that if the word that is being defined (the definiendum) occurs within the text of its own definition, but occurs with a different part of speech, then it will be an instance of zero-affix morphology.

Reference-contexts: the words that are instances of zero-affix morphology will be treated as matching despite the different tag. 11 8 Conclusion Comparisons of stemmed and unstemmed collections have usually indicated relatively little improvements in performance, and a query-level analysis has indicated that stemming harms almost as many queries as it helps <ref> [Harman 91] </ref>. We have shown that stemming does result in significant improvements in performance, and this improvement is most significant when the documents are fairly short.

Reference-contexts: Our approach is to treat the information associated with dictionary senses (part of speech, subcategorization, subject area codes, etc.) as multiple sources of evidence (cf. <ref> [Krovetz 91] </ref>). This process is fundamentally a divisive one, and each of the sources of evidence has exceptions (i.e., instances in which senses are related in spite of being separated by part of speech, subcategorization, or morphology).

Reference-contexts: Our hypothesis is that retrieval performance can be improved by indexing documents not by words, but by word meanings. Our previous experiments have shown that word senses are strongly correlated with judgments of relevance <ref> [Krovetz 92a] </ref>; when the sense of a query word does not match the sense of the word in a document, the document is unlikely to be relevant with respect to that word.

Reference-contexts: It also does not try to make matches between word senses that are idiomatic (these are identified by font codes). This experiment is similar to one conducted by Lesk (cf. <ref> [Lesk 86] </ref>), but our experiment is focused on identifying links between morphological variants, and Lesk's experiments were designed to resolve lexical ambiguity directly; that approach only had a success rate of approximately 40%.

Reference-contexts: That is, the noun bears the semantic relation of formation to the verb that defines it. This is similar to the effect that the morpheme -ize has on the noun union in order to make the verb unionize (cf. <ref> [Marchand 63] </ref>). The result of the experiment is that the dictionary contains at least 2636 senses in which the headword was mentioned, but with a different part-of-speech, and all of these senses were related.

Reference-contexts: If this word 1 English and Hebrew form two extremes; English typically has only three or four variants per word. Experiments with Slovene support the argument that stemming is very important for highly inflected languages <ref> [Popovic and Willet 92] </ref>. 1 were simply stemmed we might conflate it with senses of `gravity' that do not have the appropriate meaning. Recognizing the ties between morphological variants is also an important component of an algorithm for word-sense disambiguation. <p> The type of affix is explicitly indicated. We also note that the number of suffixes for English stands in marked contrast to a highly inflected language; <ref> [Popovic and Willet 92] </ref> describes a stemmer for Slovene that uses 5276 suffixes. 6 The term dictionary is a data structure used by the retrieval system; it contains the vocabulary for the collection, and should not be confused with the general-purpose dictionary we are using for our experiments.

Reference-contexts: Stemming can be viewed from several different perspectives. It can be thought of as a mechanism for query expansion as a way of enhancing the query with terms that are not the literal word-forms given by the user; from this view it is similar to using a thesaurus (cf. <ref> [Stevens 70] </ref>). From another perspective it can be viewed as clustering, in which the clusters are based on the rules for conflation. From a third perspective it is a way of normalizing the concepts used in the query.
