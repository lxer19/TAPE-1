Abstract: Market mechanisms are drawing more attention in computer science as a possible approach to difficult resource allocation problems. We broadly consider the feasibility of such an approach, with the focus on optimization, at a level accessible to a general computer science audience. The nature of market mechanisms is discussed from both computer science and economic perspectives Classifying definitions are motivated, then applied to market-inspired software designs reported in the literature. Potential advantages and disadvantages of the market approach are identified and explained.

Reference-contexts: The first convincing demonstration of sufficient conditions for the existence of general equilibria is attributed to Arrow and Debreu <ref> [1] </ref>. Appendix B presents a formal model similar to theirs, with sufficient conditions for existence of equilibria. Informally and approximately, constraints sufficient to guarantee existence of equilibria are that agent preference and production functions are continuous, convex, and monotonic (convex preference corresponds to concave utility for consumers).

Reference-contexts: It assumes that buyers and sellers are able to find each other, but does not say much about the effects of difficulty and delay in doing so. Finally, the two fundamental theorems of welfare economics due to Arrow <ref> [2] </ref> tell us that any competitive equilibrium is a Pareto optimum, and any Pareto optimal allocation can be achieved through competitive equilibration after appropriate lump-sum transfers. In other words, any Pareto optimum can be reached through equilibration if we select the correct starting point.

Reference-contexts: Accordingly, there has been considerable interest in defining limited forms of rationality and examining their consequences. One trend has been to attempt to give a small set of axioms that generate sufficiently "rational" agent behavior. The "rationalizability" approach of Pearce [30] and Bernheim <ref> [3] </ref> is an example. Other work has examined the selection or adaptation of game-playing automata in repetitive game scenarios (for example, [29, 25, 23]). Use of automata and other formal models allows a notion of bounded rationality to be studied rigorously.

Reference-contexts: Wellman's interests are in distributed AI and he suggests that the market-oriented programming approach is most appropriate in a distributed environment. Therefore he intentionally chose a t^atonnement-like equilibration technique for walras that is potentially distributable. The algorithm is described in some detail in <ref> [4] </ref> along with proofs of its convergence. Wellman has studied applicability of market programming to multicommodity flow [41], configuration design [42], and location of servers in a network [28].

Appendix A: Market Methods in the CS Literature As promised, here are brief summary descriptions of the published computer science work describing market related techniques referred to in Section 6. 26 [CH] Cheriton and Harty <ref> [5] </ref> have proposed an operating system ex-tension that would allow application programs to have greater control over their own memory use. The mechanism is intended to serve as a way for memory scheduling to be devolved to applications in order to promote efficiency, rather than to increase fairness.

Reference-contexts: Not only does it seem implausible that people consistently and correctly apply highly sophisticated reasoning to their actions, but experiments with human subjects have shown significant deviation from theoretically optimal strategies <ref> [6] </ref>.

It has been argued that Pareto optimization is, if not equivalent to optimization of system utility, at least more natural and perhaps more desirable or even inevitable in a distributed or planning context <ref> [12, 41] </ref>. Inevitability of Pareto optimization seems to follow if local utilities are not comparable; in other words there is no objective basis for determining the relative value of utility granted to either of two independent agents.

Goods are initially allocated to agents in the form of endowments. <p> This mechanism is analogous to the way prices were adjusted in the Paris stock market at his time [7]. Contemporary economists are more likely to use a fixed-point algorithm (e.g., [17]) or apply Newton's method to solve their models <ref> [32] </ref>. In all cases, a critical difference from the 21 behavior of actual markets is that equilibria are solved for static con-ditions, before any exchange of goods or production takes place. <p> Appendix B: A General Equilibrium Formulation A simple economic model for general equilibrium analysis is given as an illustration for understanding the conditions for existence of equilibria in such models. The formulation is essentially that given by Shoven & Whalley <ref> [32] </ref>. We assume the existence of n goods, whose market prices are given by the vector p = hp 1 ; : : : ; p n i. All prices are non-negative: p i 0.

Reference-contexts: The following subsections outline these difficulties. 7.1 Rationality, Competition and Incentives Adam Smith argued in favor of the efficient organizing effects of free economic competition by using the metaphor of an "invisible hand" coordinating the efforts of individuals <ref> [34] </ref>. Can such an invisible hand be recruited within an automated system? Human economic markets are acknowledged to operate imperfectly (with chaotic fluctuations and deviations from optimal allocations), and any formalized market mechanism is no closer than an abstraction of some limited aspect of human economic interaction.

Reference-contexts: It is this stronger form of rationality that is implicitly appealed to in economic analyses such as, for example, Vickrey's argument of average expected price equivalence between certain auction mechanisms <ref> [37] </ref>, and in analyses of apparant paradoxes in rational choice where backwards induction is used to argue for the rationality of non-intuitive choices [19].

Reference-contexts: However, if local optima exist, and the utility surface is not well understood, selection of the correct starting point can be quite difficult, as evidenced by the large literature devoted to simulated annealing <ref> [38] </ref> and similar techniques. The upshot of all the above is not that competitive equilibration has no use in computer science, but that application may only be practical under special circumstances, and theory alone will rarely be sufficient to justify expectation of good performance.

The technique dynamically equilibrates supply and demand, but does away with the need for any explicit price adjustment or billing mechanism. Use of a resource, say a CPU, is assigned for a limited time to a job selected stochastically from the eligible pool.

It has been argued that Pareto optimization is, if not equivalent to optimization of system utility, at least more natural and perhaps more desirable or even inevitable in a distributed or planning context <ref> [12, 41] </ref>. Inevitability of Pareto optimization seems to follow if local utilities are not comparable; in other words there is no objective basis for determining the relative value of utility granted to either of two independent agents. <p> Therefore he intentionally chose a t^atonnement-like equilibration technique for walras that is potentially distributable.

[W] Wellman appears to have been the first computer scientist to recognize that general equilibrium can be treated as a general solution technique for computational problems and put it into practice. He is exploring an approach he calls market-oriented programming <ref> [43] </ref> and has designed a general tool named walras towards that end. A program is specified in walras by defining a set of consumers and producers and their utilities, technologies and endowments.
