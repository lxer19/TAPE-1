Title: Energy Management Issues for Computer Systems  
Author: Dennis Lee 
Abstract: Energy efficiency has become a concern for computer system designers. In this paper, we provide a framework for looking at energy efficiency and the attempts at making systems more energy efficient. We explore techniques for measuring power dissipation in a system. Finally, we survey the technologies and the techniques that have been used to control power in the CPU, display, and disk subsystems.

Reference-contexts: However, instead of a single high energy electron gun, field-emission displays use an array of microscopic cathodes for each pixel. When a pixel has to be lighted up, only the cathodes for that pixel need to be activated <ref> [Ajluni 94] </ref>. 5.3 Software Issues It's unlikely that with current LCD and CRT displays that there is much opportunity for software to play a part in lowering power dissipation with fine granularity. LCD screens fundamentally function by selectively modulating light in different parts of the screen.

Reference-contexts: When the disks spin up, the heads drag along the media until the platters are spinning fast enough for the laminar flow of air to be great enough to make the heads airborne <ref> [Bell 91] </ref>. This places a lot of wear on the drive and manufacturers typically only recommend from 10,000 to 50,000 starts and stops before disk reliability becomes an issue. <p> Moreover, since the heads no longer lie on top of the platters, the spindle motor (the motor that spins the platters) no longer needs to generate enough torque to overcome the static friction between the head and the media on startup greatly reducing spin-up power consumption <ref> [Bell 91] </ref>. In idle mode, a substantial portion of the power consumed is in the drive electronics.

Reference-contexts: Instead of fetching the entire block of an address, they would only fetch the word required from the cache. They found that this greatly improved the energy usage of the cache without impacting performance. Finally, they use gray code encoding for communicating to memory which decreases bit switching rates. <ref> [Bunda et al. 94] </ref> looked at the energy efficiency of several instruction cache organizations and compares the fetch efficiency of using a 16-bit instruction set versus a 32-bit instruction set. <p> Finally, 5 The R4200 uses a 2-entry instruction micro-TLB to minimize accesses to a bigger 32-entry TLB. 12 they found that 16-bit instructions uses less energy than 32-bit instructions because the processor effectively fetches more instructions at a given time. <ref> [Bunda et al. 94] </ref> indicates that one may trade off cache performance for more energy efficiency. However, it does not account for either the energy used in the memory system 6 , or the energy that the processor consumes while waiting for the cache miss to return.

Reference-contexts: However, this mode is not necessarily much more energy efficient than for the CPU to perform a burst of activity then go into a low power mode as the same amount of energy is consumed for both scenarios for the same amount of work <ref> [Burd & Brodersen 95] </ref>. * Doze mode in this mode, the processor clock is disabled but the snoop logic and data cache is kept active to keep the cache coherent.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, processor power dissipation is affected significantly by layout and circuit styles [Chandraskan et al. 92, Mehra & Rabaey 94].

Reference-contexts: One could account for the power dissipation of the processor by modeling the processor and running simulation on the processor model. Unfortunately, processor power dissipation is affected significantly by layout and circuit styles <ref> [Chandraskan et al. 92, Mehra & Rabaey 94] </ref>. <p> Moreover, if V dd can be lowered to below V tn + jV tp j, the short circuit power dissipation 11 goes away <ref> [Chandraskan et al. 92] </ref>. However, microprocessors are designed to operate at the fastest clock rate possible: the parallelism found through these techniques are exploited to increase clock rate rather than reduce power dissipation.

Reference-contexts: The erase operation takes a few tens of milliseconds and can either be performed when a write to the block is required, or it can be decoupled from the write. The overhead due to the erase operation is called the cleaning overhead. <ref> [Douglis et al. 94a] </ref> and [Wu & Zwaenepoel 94] explored using flash memory as an alternative for disks.

[Douglis et al. 94a] compared the power and performance characteristics of hard disks versus two organizations of flash memory (a coupled write-erase organization with small erase units and a decoupled write-erase organizations with mid-sized erase units). <p> They use a small amount of battery backed SRAM to buffer writes and to hold translation tables from logical addresses to physical addresses. Like <ref> [Douglis et al. 94a] </ref>, they found that cleaning overhead significantly slows down the response time of the memory when utilization exceeds 80%. They explored different cleaning algorithms and found that a hybrid approach using a FIFO algorithm and a locality gathering algorithm worked best for most reference patterns.

Reference-contexts: Software may be able to selectively increase and decrease intensity to parts of the screen depending on user activity (e.g. darkening unused windows) to save energy. 6 Disks Managing the disk drive has been a very active area of research <ref> [Douglis et al. 94b, Li et al. 94] </ref>. It takes about 20% of the power for portable computers, but represents and area where clever management can reduce this power dissipation significantly [Li et al. 94]. <p> The simplest spin-down policy uses a fixed threshold to determine when to spin-down. The disk is spun down when the disk has been idle for the given fixed threshold. <ref> [Douglis et al. 94b] </ref> explored predictive algorithms where the disk is spun down based on previous reference patterns but found the results disappointing. [Douglis et al. 95] explored modifying the threshold depending on how much time the disk had been sleeping before the next disk request.

Reference-contexts: Table 4 shows the percentage of time different units are idle during the execution of the SPEC92 benchmarks. The 603 by default disables clocks to the different units and selectively enables clocks within each unit by pipeline stage and instruction type. <ref> [Gary et al. 94] </ref> claims to have saved from 10 to 20% savings due to this optimization. 4.2 Optimizing the architecture Exploiting parallelism On the architecture level, special purpose DSP chips exploit the fact that the chips need to function at a certain throughput and going faster isn't advantageous. <p> It's an interesting piece of work, unfortunately, it's unlikely that dynamically changeable voltage processors will be available. The O/S is also responsible to switch the processor between different power states that most power conscious processors provide. These typically include <ref> [Gary et al. 94] </ref>: * Lower clock speed mode this mode decreases the clock speed to stretch battery life. This reduces power consumption if the user is willing to tolerate lower throughput on his jobs.
