Abstract: In this paper we present results of experiments carried out with a route learning system for a mobile robot, conducted in a `real world' environment covering distances of several hundred metres. The system uses no odometry and is based on a self-organising mapbuilding process using perceptual landmarks.

Reference-contexts: Roughly following Ballard and Whitehead's definitions <ref> [1] </ref> we can define two types of perceptual aliasing in the context of our route following task: 1. Propitious aliasing - (signatureA = signatureB) ^ (actionA = actionB) 2.

Reference-contexts: A rough guide could perhaps be achieved by counting the number of `different' input vectors gathered on one circuit of the route (difference being defined by a pre-determined similarity measure). An alternative approach might be to use growing networks such as Fritzke's "neural gas" network <ref> [2] </ref>. The system as it stands is restricted to following a canonical path (the information contained in the map is similar to `route knowledge', see [8]), and as such is unsuitable for free navigation.

Reference-contexts: In this way, regions of the network can be seen as representing `perceptual landmarks' within the robot's environment. Used in this manner the SOFM provides a mapbuilding mechanism that is suitable for localisation tasks in mobile robots (see also <ref> [3, 6, 7, 9] </ref>). For route learning the SOFM can be used to associate locus and action by extending the input and weight vectors to include the required actions.

Reference-contexts: This robot is equipped with 16 sonar sensors, 16 infra-red sensors, 20 tactile sensors and a monochrome CCD camera; in these experiments only the sonar and infra-red sensors were used. The route learning system was developed at Manchester and uses a Self-Organising Feature Map (SOFM) <ref> [4] </ref> to build a representation of the environment (using the robot's sensory perception) as the robot is guided along the route by an operator.

To find the output o j of unit j we calculate the weighted sum of its inputs: n X w jk i k = ~w j ~- (1) with n being the number of elements in the input vector.

One approach to solving this problem would be to use a `history' of past perceptions (or alternatively past nodes) as part of the input vector to disambiguate locations (see e.g. <ref> [7, 9] </ref>). However, one of the problems with this approach is that it would also have a negative effect on propitious aliasing. An alternative might be to carry a `floating history', with the nodes containing a list of possible actions rather than one action directly associated with a sensory pattern.

The system as it stands is restricted to following a canonical path (the information contained in the map is similar to `route knowledge', see <ref> [8] </ref>), and as such is unsuitable for free navigation. However, the perceptual clustering mechanism could be augmented with relational information such as distance and direction to other locations. Since this metric information is only local (i.e. between locations), correctional methods such as those mentioned in section 3.1 are not required.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the action is retrieved from the action section of the winner's weights (a more detailed description of this system can be found in <ref> [10] </ref>). 3 The route The route from which the results were taken is shown in figure 5.

Reference-contexts: can be seen from the results this network was far too large (see section 7 for discussion of this issue). as well as to facilitate comparison between different control systems, different robot platforms, different environments, e.t.c. in other words, they are required tools for the science of robotics (see also <ref> [11] </ref>). The route learning system was shown to cope with temporary changes to the environment (moving people), however `permanent' changes (stationary people) could cause failure.

Reference-contexts: We call this "middle scale navigation", following the definition from the biological sciences for navigation that typically encompasses foraging trips of insects covering journeys of up to 10 6 fi body length <ref> [12] </ref>. The route learning system uses no metric information whatsoever, therefore obviating the need to compensate for drift error, and no pre-installed world model is represented.
