Abstract: This paper introduces the notions of `quasi-species' and `error threshold' from molecular evolutionary biology. The error threshold is a critical mutation rate beyond which the effect of selection on the population changes drastically. We reproduce, using GAs | and hence finite populations | some interesting results obtained with an analytical model | using infinite populations | from the evolutionary biology literature. A reformulation of a previous analytical expression , which explicitly indicates the extent of the reduction in the error threshold as we move from infinite to finite populations, is derived. Error thresholds are shown to be lower for finite populations. Moreover, as in the infinite case, for low mutation rates recombination can reduce the diversity of the population and enhance overall fitness. For high mutation rates, however, recombination can push the population over the error threshold, and thereby cause a loss of genetic information. These results may be relevant to optimizing the exploration-exploitation balance in GAs. Choices for critical GA parameters such as population size, mutation and recombination rates, should be reconsidered in the light of this new knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Even in the absence of selective pressures the convergence time for a population of size N is of order N generations in asexual populations and approximately order N (ln ()) 1:1 generations in a sexual population with uniform crossover <ref> [AM94] </ref>. With finite populations we can also relax the requirement for a significant variation of fit-nesses across the landscape. Even on a completely flat fitness landscape, where all sequences have the same fitness, a finite population will drift around in a quasi-species cluster or family of clusters [DP91].

Reference-contexts: However, the work on quasi-species and error thresholds (section 2) suggest that evolution works efficiently when mutation rates are directly below the threshold value above which information is destroyed. This idea is supported by T. Back <ref> [Bac91] </ref> who suggests that "an optimal mutation rate for a GA is relatively large and turns mutation into an additional search operator". Moreover, in conventional GAs, mutation rates are usually decided upon without regard to the genotype length.

Reference-contexts: However, Boerlijst et al. <ref> [BBN96] </ref> propose a mathematical model of quasi-species dynamics which incorporates both mutation and recombination. In particular they study virus populations. <p> If p &gt; p c the fittest strain F will not be selected and each virus strain will have essentially the same relative abundance. 4.1 Bitstring recombination model In <ref> [BBN96] </ref> the mathematical model is then adapted to include recombination (see Appendix), and here we will summarize their results. Variables for double infected cells, and for viruses produced by these cells are incorporated. <p> If for instance two mutants in H 4 recombine, the product lies everywhere between F and H 8 . These distributions are observed at error rates of p = 0:07, and p = 0:08 respectively, for infinite populations <ref> [BBN96] </ref>. 6.2 Plateau landscape In the isolated peak landscape, recombination seems to be disadvantageous for the population, because it decreases the abundance of F and shifts the error threshold towards lower mutation rates. <p> Whereas table 3 show the error thresholds for infinite populations, as calculated in section 3 for an asexual population in a single peak landscape, and as reported by Boerlijst et al. <ref> [BBN96] </ref> for the other cases.

Unless the mutation rate is too large or differences in fitnesses too small, the population will typically cluster around the fittest sequence (s), forming a concentrated cloud; the average Hamming distance between two members of such a distribution drawn at random will be relatively small.

A protein space, [MS70] or more generally a sequence space, can be modeled as the space of all possible sequences of length drawn from a finite alphabet of size A. <p> With an infinite population there is a phase transition at a particular error rate p, the mutation rate at each of the loci in a sequence. Following <ref> [ES79] </ref>, we can determine analytically this critical error rate, which is defined as the rate above which the proportion of the infinite population on the peak drops to chance levels. The characteristic population distribution above and below this phase transition can be observed in figure 3a. <p> Then at the phase transition the probability of accurate replication of the `master sequence' on the peak needs to be balanced by its superior replication rate, so as to equate with the replication of all the other sequences (we are, following Eigen and Shuster model <ref> [ES79] </ref>, ignoring back-mutations from these to the master sequence). oeq = 1 (1) 1 (2) (1 p) p = oe p is very small, so we can approximate the contents of the square brackets by e 1 . <p> It should be mentioned here that some authorities suggest that, in the natural world, effective mutation rates per genotype are generally maintained close to the error threshold at something of the order of one per genotype where genotype lengths vary from 4500 (bacterial viruses) to 6:10 9 (humans) <ref> [ES79] </ref>. 4 Viral Quasi-Species and Recombination Most mathematical models describing quasi-species focus on point mutations as the principal source of variation. However, Boerlijst et al. [BBN96] propose a mathematical model of quasi-species dynamics which incorporates both mutation and recombination. In particular they study virus populations.

If, as we expect, optimal mutation rates are closely related to error thresholds; higher values for mutation rates should generally be used in GAs for practical applications.

Reference-contexts: In consequence, we argue that the notion of error threshold may well be related to the notion of optimal mutation rates in GAs. Section 2 introduces the theory of quasi-species, and the notion of error-threshold. Section 3 reformulates an expression introduced by Nowak and Shuster <ref> [NS89] </ref>. This new reformulation explicitly indicates the reduction in the error threshold as we move from infinite to finite populations. Section 3 also discusses the relevance of error threshold to optimal mutation rates. Section 4 gives a detailed recapitulation of an analytical model dealing with recombination in populations of quasi-species. <p> The above calculations are for infinite populations. For practical applications in GAs we must consider how the picture changes for finite populations. 3 The Error Threshold in Finite Populations In <ref> [NS89] </ref> the calculations of an error threshold for infinite asexually replicating populations (which we will now call p 1 )are extended to finite populations (where we shall call the critical rate p N for a population of size N ). <p> The reference is to the second term in the following expansion, on the assumption that the third and subsequent terms are relatively insignificant and can be ignored <ref> [NS89] </ref>. q N = q 1 1 + p N 2 (oe 1) + N 3=2 + : : : (6) where as before is the genotype length, and oe is the selection strength or superiority parameter of the master sequence. <p> However, error thresholds are usually reckoned in terms of critical error rates p = 1 q; and it turns out that the proportionate changes in critical values of p are much more significant in finite populations than the changes in q. Equation 6 was introduced by Nowak and Shuster <ref> [NS89] </ref>. Here we derive a reformulation of this equation, which makes explicit the reduction in the critical mutation rate as we move from an infinite population to one of size N .

Reference-contexts: Due to this characteristic of the model, the recombination rate, r, has a maximum at r = 0:5, because only heterozygous virus particles can (effectively) recombine. To model recombination itself `uniform crossover' <ref> [Sys89] </ref> is employed. The steady state structure of the new set of equations including recombination is studied. Bitstrings have length 15. The recombination rate has a maximum at r = 0:5, for the reasons exposed above.
