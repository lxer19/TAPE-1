Abstract: Although influenza vaccine efficacy is 70-90% in young healthy first-time vaccinees, the efficacy in repeat vaccinees has varied considerably. In some studies, the attack rate among repeat vaccinees was the same as in unvaccinated controls, while in other studies repeat vaccinees had a lower attack rate than first time vaccinees. It is well established that antigenic match between the vaccine and epidemic strains is important for vaccine efficacy in first time vacci-nees. In this study we examine whether the variation of vaccine efficacy in repeat vaccinees is due to both the antigenic match among vaccine strains, and the match of the vaccine strains to the epidemic strains. We use computer simulations and historical analysis. In the computer simulations, for many combinations of antigenic matches among the vaccine and epidemic strains, two vaccinations provided more protection than one. However, at some combinations, the first vaccination reduced the effectiveness of the second by clearing the injected antigen before it produced protective antibodies. Thus, in some cases, that might be common in practice,

Thus, the vaccine1-epidemic distance is likely to be greater than the vaccine1-vaccine2 distance, and thus there is likely to be more negative than positive interference by vaccine1.

Reference-contexts: A further complicating factor in this comparison is that we simulated only two vaccinations whereas some boys in the study had three vaccinations, and some boys also had natural infections (clinical and subclincal) to previous epidemics. The Melbourne studies <ref> (Feery et al., 1979) </ref> also found higher attack rates in two-time vaccinees compared with first-time vaccinees. However, they did not report the strains of previous vaccinations. We would predict small vaccine1-vaccine2 distance and a large vaccine-1-epidemic distance.

Reference-contexts: In our model system, homologous vaccine boost prior to the second influenza season failed to elicit significant rise in antibody levels, and this coupled with the antibodies having fallen below protective levels resulted in a high attack rate. Failure of homologous vaccination to boost after 2 weeks <ref> (Hobson et al., 1973) </ref> and after 6 months (Powers et al., 1984) has been seen in human trials. However, in the latter study titers had not fallen below protective levels.

Reference-contexts: We also found that attack rates during the second influenza season in groups vaccinated before the first influenza season were lowered by a second vaccination before the second influenza season. Immune suppression by circulating antibodies, as seen in our study, has also been reported for influenza vaccines in humans <ref> (Howells et al., 1973) </ref>. The degree of suppression appears to be due 18 to the amount of circulating antibodies (Hobson et al., 1973; Robinson et al., 1997).

The Houston study <ref> (Keitel et al., 1988) </ref> reported slightly lower attack rates in two-time vacci-nees than in first-time vaccinees.

Reference-contexts: Antibody-antigen binding is a complex physical-chemical process involving, among other things, shape and charge complementarity, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals interactions. Imagine, for illustrative purposes, that these binding properties could be described by some number of parameters <ref> (Perelson & Oster, 1979) </ref>; for the purposes of illustration let us assume two parameters.

However, in the latter study titers had not fallen below protective levels. We have previously performed simulations, similar to those reported here, but in which antibody levels returned close to zero levels before revaccination (Smith et al., 1997a). <p> In reality, antibody persistence appears to be different for different influenza antigens; for example, it has been found that antibody persistence was lower for the H1N1 component compared with the H3N2 and B components of a trivalent vaccine <ref> (Powers et al., 1984) </ref>. Antibody levels and persistence also appear to be affected by whether exposure was by natural infection or by vaccination.
