Abstract: This paper serves as a guide for the students admitted to a course, qualified as a Master's Course, at Stockholm University, department of Computer and Systems Sciences. The goal of the course is to train the students in scientific work and scientific writing, intended to result in a Master's thesis. This paper briefly describes the different choices the students can make, influencing their work with the Master's thesis, the requirements on a Master's thesis, as well as general aspects of research, e.g. how to choose a research topic and formulate a thesis proposal. Approximate time tables for master's theses projects are also presented. The process of scientific writing is discussed in the more detail, and the editorial requirements for a Master's thesis are also defined.
