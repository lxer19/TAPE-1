Abstract: The increasing development of mobile networks raises new security requirements and concerns. In addition to the basic need of authentication, confidentiality and key distribution services, a new problem involving privacy is the unauthorized tracking of users' migration. In other words, accessing any information related to the mobile user's location data without his consent, is a serious violation of his privacy. Moreover, if no care is taken, the disclosure of the mobile user real identity may appear during the authentication process. The basic solution to this problem is the use of aliases which insure non-traceability by hiding the user's real identity and also his relationship with domain authorities. In this paper we provide a classification of the different degrees of non-traceability and present a new efficient method for the computation of aliases. This technique can be used during authentication of mobile users and thus avoids the drawbacks of existing solutions such as GSM and CDPD.

Reference-contexts: This scheme might require too much computational time in a high dynamic environment such as mobile networks and additional nonvolatile memory on behalf the user equippment. The Global System for Mobile (GSM) <ref> [1] </ref> is the first digital cellular network to provide anonymity to his subscribers. In GSM, non-traceability is provided by using a Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identifier (TMSI).

Reference-contexts: We assume that a user has one home which is the administrative domain where he is registered on a long-term basis. When accessing the network in the home domain, the mobile user is authenticated with a traditional server-based authentication mechanism such as Kerberos <ref> [2] </ref> or KryptoKnight [3]. Users of every network domain are registered with that domain's Authentication Server (AS). The AS of a domain can be replicated or partitioned within the domain but the set of all partitioned and duplicated ASs represent a single domain-level authority.

The advantage of KryptoKnight is that it benefits of stong authentication protocols and provides formal insurance of security with respect to a number of attacks.

Reference-contexts: Next, AS r computes its authentication message containing AU T H uh with K rh (secret key shared with AS h ) using a token chaining technique. Further details on this kind of authentication technique are de scribed in <ref> [4] </ref>. 3. When AS h receives the message in flow 2, it pro ceeds as follows: (a) It deciphers N u and the user's alias with S h .

Reference-contexts: The advantage of KryptoKnight is that it benefits of stong authentication protocols and provides formal insurance of security with respect to a number of attacks. The expression in figure 1 is computed as a result of applying a strong encryption function E, e.g., DES <ref> [6] </ref>, with Kab as the encryption key, over three inputs: one nonce (N a), a timestamp (T a) and the name of the message originator.

Reference-contexts: But the main concern with GSM is when a user first switches on his portable phone his International Mobile Subscriber Identifier (IMSI) is trans-mited in clear through the radio path (the TMSI is allocated only after this step). In the Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) <ref> [7] </ref>, before the authentication procedure takes place, the mobile unit engages a Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol with the visited authority in order to obtain a shared-secret key. Next, the mobile unit's identity is enciphered with this key.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 presents a method for protecting identification which can be used during authentication of mobile users. Section 5 concludes with a summary of the paper. 2 Review of Existing Approaches Providing anonymity to users is not a new feature. Some mechanisms exist for banking environments <ref> [9, 10] </ref>. The main problem with this approach, is even if the payment is untraceable, the identity of the customer is revealed during authentication. However, another mecanism allows the computation of untraceable credentials.
