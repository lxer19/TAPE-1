Abstract: In recent years, encouraged by today's fast workstations and by software systems designed to transform workstation clusters into parallel programming environments, network of workstations have been increasingly used as computational engines. Networked workstations, however, are not ideal replacements for supercomputers, because of the low interconnection capacity provided by current local area networks. In this paper, we present an application using the EcliPSe toolkit, a system for replication-based parallel processing in heterogeneous environments. Although primarily designed for replicative applications (that generally do not require large amounts of communication), EcliPSe can be used for more general forms of message-passing parallel processing. We describe the use of the toolkit in the parallelization of a cluster labeling algorithm. The algorithm is designed so that it uses some of EcliPSe's features to reduce communication overhead, making the algorithm suitable for execution on workstation clusters. Early performance results are described. Nos ultimos anos, encorajados pelas r apidas estac oes de trabalho e tamb em pelos sistemas de software que visam transformar aglomerados de estac oes em ambientes de programac ao paralela, redes de estac oes tem sido cada vez mais usadas como engenhos computacionais. Entretanto, redes de estac oes n ao s ao substitutos ideais para supercomputadores, devido a baixa capacidade de interconex ao fornecida pelas atuais redes locais. Neste artigo, apresentamos EcliPSe, um sistema de software para processamento paralelo em ambiente heterog eneo para aplicac oes baseadas no paradigma de replicac ao. EcliPSe tamb em suporta formas mais gerais de processamento paralelo basedo em troca de mensagens. Neste artigo, apresentamos o uso do sistema EcliPSe na paralelizac ao de um algortmo de rotulamento de aglomerados. O algortmo foi projetado para usar algumas funcionalidades de EcliPSe para reduzir o tempo gasto em comunicac ao, o que torna o algortmo adequado para uso em redes de estac oes. Descrevemos no artigo algumas medidas de desempenho obtidas na execuc ao do programa paralelo.

Reference-contexts: The problem is appraoched by focusing on a linear chain that has a restricted interaction with the medium; that is, there are forbidden regions, and the chain is confined to other parts of the medium. This can be modeled by a self-avoiding walk on a randomly diluted lattice (see <ref> [11] </ref> for example), which is created by having a grid that is filled with probability p. A self-avoiding walk is one that moves from a site to a nearest neighbor, avoiding sites that were previously occupied and also sites that are not filled. <p> The present version of EcliPSe, an improvement over the prototype presented in [10, 12], has already been used for production applications, such as the work described in <ref> [11] </ref>. 3.1 Structure A sequential application requires only minimal changes in order to utilize the power of EcliPSe. This generally entails insertion of EcliPSe primitives in the original source code with some (usually trivial) rearrangement of the code.

Reference-contexts: Many scientific applications that previously required supercomputers can now be executed in a distributed manner by dividing the computation among heterogeneous workstations and using a local (or wide) area network as the communication substratum. This approach has been called cluster computing, metacomputing, network-based computing, among other names <ref> [14] </ref>. Using networked workstations in distributed computing is very attractive, since these are usually much cheaper and more easily available than supercomputers.
