Title: A Model of the Human Capacity for Lexicalizing Spatial Relations  
Author: Terry Regier 
Address: Berkeley  
Affiliation: University of California at  
Note: Draft, submitted to Cognitive Linguistics.  
Abstract: Languages vary dramatically in their structuring of space. Despite this wide variation, there must also exist commonalities simply by virtue of the fact that all linguistic spatial systems are based on human experience of space, which is in turn constrained by the nature of the human perceptual system. I present a connectionist model which learns the perceptually grounded semantics for spatial terms from a range of languages | providing at least a preliminary model of the human capacity for lexicalizing spatial events and relations. The model's design incorporates a number of structural devices which are motivated by neurobiological and psychophysical evidence concerning the human visual system. The model gives rise to predictions concerning which semantic features and combinations of features one can expect to find in lexemes for spatial events and relations in the world's languages.

Reference-contexts: Thus, this can be viewed as a beginning-path-end representation, as it implicitly decomposes a trajectory into a beginning, an end, and the path from one to the other. The motivation for this structure comes from the visual phenomenon of apparent motion <ref> (Kolers 1972) </ref>. Human subjects, when presented with an object displayed briefly at one position in the visual field, and then with another copy of the object displayed at another position, often perceive the object moving smoothly from the first point to the second.

Reference-contexts: In addition, space (along with time) has a privileged position as a fundamental conceptual structuring device in language, a position which most other domains, color included, do not share. <ref> (Lakoff 1987) </ref> points out that such fundamental concepts as those relating to time and space tend to be used in many other concepts throughout a given linguistic system, often through metaphor, and are not localized to isolated domains of experience, as most other concepts (e.g. socialism) are. <p> Recent connectionist research in modeling apparent motion (Olson 1989) has focused on the computation of explicit trajectories given beginning and end points. As it happens, there is also linguistic motivation for choosing a structure such as this one: <ref> (Lakoff 1987) </ref> notes that linguistically, events are often structured in terms of three components: a source, or point of origin for motion, a path, or trajectory traced through space by the motion, and a destination, the endpoint of motion.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a positive example of in is taken as an implicit negative example of above, below, outside, through, etc. This is essentially the same as the "principle of mutual exclusivity", posited for the process of learning to name objects <ref> (Markman 1987) </ref>. Related ideas can also be found in the language learning literature (Johnston & Slobin 1979; Clark 1987; Pinker 1989; Bolinger 1965; Chomsky & Lasnik 1977; MacWhinney 1989). 10 There is a serious problem with this useful heuristic, however: it can easily give rise to false implicit negative evidence.

Reference-contexts: In the terms we are using here, given the beginning point and then the end point, the subjects perceptually infer the path. Thus, beginning point and end point serve as anchor-points of sorts, from which the path is computed. Recent connectionist research in modeling apparent motion <ref> (Olson 1989) </ref> has focused on the computation of explicit trajectories given beginning and end points.

Reference-contexts: I shall not be able to describe this network in detail; I refer the interested reader to <ref> (Regier 1992) </ref>. However, a few key points will be highlighted. Firstly, notice the overall input/output behavior: individual movie frames are presented to the system one by one, as shown at the bottom of Figure 4. <p> Mutual exclusivity can be salvaged however, by treating positive and negative instances differently during training. In particular, implicit negatives are viewed as supplying only weak negative evidence, while explicit positives supply strong positive evidence. The details of this method may be found in <ref> (Regier 1992) </ref>. 6 Results The model was trained using back-propagation and some variants (Rumelhart et al. 1986; Fahlman 1988). In some cases, explicit negative evidence was used if the unavailability of a full contrast set precluded the use of mutual exclusivity as a learning heuristic.

Reference-contexts: Rather, they are visual structures, independently motivated on neurobiological and psychophysical grounds. 4 The Model been discussing highlighted. As shown in the figure, the model is configured to learn a set of English spatial terms. The model is trained using the connectionist error back-propagation training algorithm <ref> (Rumelhart et al. 1986) </ref>, while its architecture is informed by the design philosophy of adaptive structured connectionism (Regier & Feldman 1993).

Reference-contexts: Space is also attractive as a domain of semantic inquiry because there is considerable cross-linguistic variation in spatial systems. The notion of cross-linguistic variation in conceptual systems and modes of thought has long been a subject of fascination for linguists (see <ref> (Whorf 1956) </ref> for an early and extremely influential example). Such differences in spatial systems are sometimes quite dramatic, but more often than not they are rather subtle, particularly when one compares closely related languages.
