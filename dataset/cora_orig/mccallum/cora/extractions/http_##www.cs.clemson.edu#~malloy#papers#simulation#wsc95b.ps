Abstract: 4). The increase in speedup here reflects our use of stripewidth as a basis for lookahead. As mobility decreases the average time that a portable spends in a cell increases. Therefore the lower the mobility, the more time between high concentrations of portable movement. This allows our model to take advantage of stripewidth lookahead more often than with higher mobility. Because the PCS network was able to use stripewidth lookahead more often with lower mobilities the amount of communication needed to ensure the local causality constraint was decreased as seen in Table 1. In this paper we have presented a time-driven conservative model of a distributed PCS network simulation. Using the model, we are able to simulate large, metropolitan sized PCS networks to achieve good speedup. On our network of SUN SLC workstations we can simulate approximately 14,400 cells per processor using a distributed approach. Our experiments produce speedups ranging from 3:41 (for low traffic density and high mobility) to 7:49 (for high traffic density and low mobility). We have introduced a method for exploiting looka-head based on stripewidth and maintaining the validity of the lookahead using a technique that we call keeping secrets. We produce good speedup without imposing restrictions on portable movement, thus keeping the simulation as realistic as possible. With the lookahead that we obtain, we are able to reduce the average number of messages sent by a processor from 500,000 (SimulationLength = 2:5fi10 5 ) to an average number of messages that ranges from 124,254:3 (density = 25 portables per cell, mobility = 1/(75 minutes)) to 259,057:9 (density = 75 portables per cell, mobility = 1/(15 minutes)).
