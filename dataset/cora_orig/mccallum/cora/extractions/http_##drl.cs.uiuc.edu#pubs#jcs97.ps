Abstract: Often an information source on the Web would like to provide different classes of service to different clients. In the autonomous, highly distributed world of the Web, the traditional approach of using authentication to differentiate between classes of clients is no longer sufficient, as knowledge of a client's identity will often not suffice to determine whether a client is authorized to use a service. Our goal in this research project is to explore the use of digital credentials, digital analogues of the paper credentials we carry in our wallets today, to help solve this problem. In this paper we describe the major features required of a Web environment deploying digital credentials, including the introduction of security assistants for both clients and servers, and report on the status of our investigation into a credential-based environment.

To simplify the specification of which users have which privileges, software systems often divide users into groups and specify privileges on a per-group basis.

Reference-contexts: Authentication can be accomplished using current well-known techniques and software, ranging from the primitive (and insecure) approach of supplying a password, through more modern public/private key approaches such as PEM <ref> [6] </ref> and PGP [13]. Since credential issuers may refer to the same client by different names, the client may have to authenticate to multiple identities when trying to use the credentials.

Reference-contexts: For example, one 4 approach to export of policies is to use a dialect of the standard knowledge interchange format KIF <ref> [7] </ref>. As an example policy, the Record's server may require proof of ACM SIGMOD membership for clients that wish to read the text of Record articles. Article abstracts, however, may be available to all ACM members as well as SIGMOD members.
