Reference-contexts: Introduction of predictors of higher orders further decreased differential error and thus reduced distortions caused by the quantizer. This approach, however, introduced more time consuming operations and required more complicated prediction algorithms <ref> [5] </ref>. In our case the decrease of distortion together with reduction of data rate was not dramatic since our original signal was highly oversam-pled. 5. CONCLUSION To summarize, we presented a simple coding method for EEG signals based on octave-band filter bank subband decomposition.
