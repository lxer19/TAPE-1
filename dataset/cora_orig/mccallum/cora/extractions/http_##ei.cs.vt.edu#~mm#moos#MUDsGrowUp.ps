Title: Another possibility is a virtual bulletin board repre-sented in the physical world by a large-scale

Abstract: With appropriate sensors in users of fices, we could reflect into the virtual world such important physical cues as closing the office door, or having a telephone of f-hook. These could be presented to potential visitors in the virtual world to let them know that interruptions might not be appropriate at the current time. One particularly intriguing direction in this area is a connection to the PARC building management computer system, allowing Jupiter users both to monitor conditions (by moving to the virtual analog of a physical location of interest) and to control them, using MOO programs. W e have specific plans to investigate this direction in the near future. A goal of the Jupiter system is that it tie together all of the workers here at PARC, not merely the research staf f. There are a number of exciting scenarios possible if we can achieve this. We envision being able to visit the PARC library through Jupiter and to get the online assistance of the staff there in learning how to use their specialized interfaces to a variety of information sources. W e would like to be able to confer with people in the accounting and purchasing departments concerning such matters as expense reports and purchase orders while sharing online views of those items. Our facilities staff, who maintain the physical plant of the building, could be queried regarding office furniture arrangements or telephone and network connections using a shared office map and furniture layout tool. In all of these cases, we imagine communicating easily with these people from our own of fices using application-specific props and tools, preferably of the specialists own design. Much of Astro-VR is running and it is now accepting its first users. Jupiter is also operational, with essentially all of the technologies described above in daily use. In both cases, we are in the process of growing the installed base of applications preparatory to attempting to engage a larger community of serious, day-to-day users.
