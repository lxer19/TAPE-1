Abstract: One of the major factors hindering the use of qualitative simulation techniques to reason about the behavior of complex dynamical systems is intractable branching due to a phenomenon called chatter. Chatter occurs when a variable's direction of change is constrained only by continuity within a region of the state space. This results in intractable, potentially infinite branching within the behavioral description due to irrelevant distinctions in the direction of change. Dynamic chatter abstraction provides a general purpose, scalable solution that abstracts chattering regions of the state space into a single state within the behavioral description. Chattering regions are identified via a dynamic analysis of the model and the current qualitative state using knowledge of the inference capability of the simulation algorithm.

For many models, a variable's direction of change is ambiguous only within certain regions of the state space.

Reference-contexts: At times, some of these distinctions may be irrelevant to the current task and thus needlessly increase the complexity of the simulation. One of the major sources of irrelevant distinctions is a phenomenon called chatter <ref> (Kuipers 1994) </ref>. Chatter occurs when the derivative of a variable is constrained only by continuity within a region of the state space. Within the simulation, the variable is free to alternate between increasing, steady, and decreasing with individual behaviors generated for different order-ings of these values. <p> For some of the models generated by TRIPEL, chatter box abstraction is simply unable to complete the simulation due to resource limitations. diction questions. Chatter and Qualitative Simulation Dynamic chatter abstraction has been developed as an extension to the the QSIM simulation algorithm <ref> (Kuipers 1994) </ref>. QSIM describes the behavior of a dynamical system via a tree of alternating time-interval and time-point states called a behavior tree. Each state specifies a qualitative magnitude (qmag) and a direction of change (qdir) for each variable within the model.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the derivative variable will chatter around zero as its integral chatters. While chattering behaviors may describe a real behavior of the system <ref> (Kuipers et. al. 1991) </ref>, a disjunctive enumeration of all possible combinations of values provides no information. Furthermore, this enumeration obscures other distinctions within the description and can result in an infinite simulation. <p> Eliminating this source of distinctions is essential if qualitative simulation is to be used to reason about complex dynamical systems. Previous Solutions Three previous methods have been developed for eliminating chatter within a QSIM behavior tree simulation. The higher order derivative (HOD) <ref> (Kuipers et. al. 1991) </ref> technique uses the second and third order derivatives of the chattering variables to determine a unique direction of change for unconstrained variables and eliminate spurious behaviors. <p> This technique, however, is not effective when an ambiguous evaluation of the HOD expression results or when an expression cannot be derived. In addition, the automatic derivation of an HOD expression places additional assumptions on the monotonic functions described by M + and M constraints. Ignore qdirs <ref> (Fouche and Kuipers, 1991) </ref> eliminates chatter by ignoring distinctions in a variable's direction of change throughout the simulation. This technique requires the modeler to identify the chattering variables prior to the simulation. For many models, a variable's direction of change is ambiguous only within certain regions of the state space. <p> Two types of nodes exist within the chatter dependency graph: equivalency nodes and dependency nodes. An equivalency node is created for each set of chatter equivalent variables within the model. The variables within the model are partitioned into chatter equivalency classes using an extension of an algorithm presented in <ref> (Kuipers et. al. 1991) </ref> (see figure 4). Equivalency nodes are connected through a directed, AND-OR subgraph of intermediate dependency nodes. The AND-OR subgraph can be viewed as a predicate that specifies the conditions under which the variables in an equivalency node are free to chatter.

Reference-contexts: Rickel and Porter (1994) use qualitative simulation to answer prediction questions within the domain of plant physiology. The TRIPEL algorithm automatically generates a qualitative model from a large-scale botany knowledge base <ref> (Porter et. al. 1988) </ref> in response to a user query. Answers are generated based upon the results of the simulation. Many of their models, however, exhibit a great deal of chatter.
