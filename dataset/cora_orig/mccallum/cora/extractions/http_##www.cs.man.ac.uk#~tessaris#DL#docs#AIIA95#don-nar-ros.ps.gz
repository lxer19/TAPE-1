Abstract: In this paper we propose an epistemic concept language, where the epistemic operator is interpreted in terms of minimal knowledge. We show that the proposed formalism provides an adequate characterization of many non-first-order aspects of frame-based knowledge representation systems, by admitting in the knowledge base various forms of epistemic sentences. In particular, we address the formalization of defaults and role closure. We argue that the minimization of knowledge captures intuitive and natural forms of reasoning that arise by restricting the attention to the individuals that are known to the knowledge base. Many of these forms of reasoning are actually provided by several knowledge representation systems, whose implementation is object centered.

Reference-contexts: In fact, frame-based systems, as well as systems based on concept languages [3, 13], admit both forms of nonmonotonic reasoning, such as defaults and closed world reasoning, and procedural features, e.g. rules. These issues have been addressed in the recent literature (see for example <ref> [1, 5, 16, 17, 22] </ref>), but the proposals typically capture one of the above mentioned aspects. In this paper we propose a concept language with an epistemic operator, with the aim of providing a unified framework to capture the following features: defaults, procedural rules, weak definitions, role and concept closures. <p> In this framework one has to deal with the issue of giving a semantics to open defaults, i.e. defaults in which free variables occur. The semantics of open defaults is still debated [2, 12]; we adopt the semantics proposed by Baader and Hollunder <ref> [1] </ref>, which restricts the application of defaults only to the individuals explicitly mentioned in the ABox. Notice that this semantics can be viewed as the natural extension of the semantics of rules given in [5], where rules apply only to the known individuals in the knowledge base.

These issues have been addressed in the recent literature (see for example [1, 5, 16, 17, 22]), but the proposals typically capture one of the above mentioned aspects. <p> In this setting it is possible to formalize procedural rules in the style of CLASSIC <ref> [3] </ref>, and weak definitions that arise by treating the definition A : = D as the two weaker inclusions fKA v D; KD v Ag. In the present paper we address two additional kinds of epistemic sentences in the knowledge base: 1. <p> Sentences admitting the knowledge operator in role expressions; in this case it is possible to capture the notion of role closure as it is provided in actual systems <ref> [3, 13] </ref>; in addition, by generalizing the use of the epistemic operators in concept expressions, it is possible to express the idea of concept closure, which has often been considered as a desirable extension of these systems. <p> Examples are explained by referring to the (more intuitive) logic ALCK (S5 G ). However, the same epistemic models arise if one interprets sentences in ALCK (S4F G ). Closure on roles is available both in CLASSIC (see <ref> [3] </ref>) and in LOOM (see [13]). The idea is to restrict universal role quantifications to the known individuals filling the role in the knowledge base.

Reference-contexts: Different forms of non-first-order reasoning can be captured in a modal epis-temic language by identifying classes of epistemic sentences. In particular, for epistemic concept language, the modal operator has been first introduced in the query language to express queries to a first-order concept knowledge base <ref> [4] </ref>. In this case one can express a form of closed-world reasoning, as well as integrity constraints in the style of [19]. <p> Therefore, we can define a decision procedure for ALC-knowledge bases containing defaults, and allowing epistemic queries. Such a procedure employs the calculus for ALCK (S5 G ) defined in <ref> [4] </ref> and separately treats defaults, for example using the method of Schwind and Risch [21] instanciating each default on all the known individuals.

The framework proposed here is a generalization of the one described in <ref> [5] </ref> to a family of epistemic languages, which is parametric with respect to the accessibility relation between possible world structures. <p> In particular, for epistemic concept language, the modal operator has been first introduced in the query language to express queries to a first-order concept knowledge base [4]. In this case one can express a form of closed-world reasoning, as well as integrity constraints in the style of [19]. In <ref> [5] </ref>, the knowledge base admits a simple form of epistemic sentences and is therefore is constituted by a pair (R; A), where A is a concept knowledge base and R is a set of epistemic sentences of the form KC v D, where C; D are concept expressions. <p> In the present paper we address two additional kinds of epistemic sentences in the knowledge base: 1. Sentences representing defaults based on the translation given in [24]; the epistemic sentences used in <ref> [5] </ref> to represent rules can be viewed as a special case of defaults, however, we show that defaults can not be adequately represented in that framework. 2. <p> Generally speaking, we use KC to denote the set of individuals known to be instances of the concept C in every model for the knowledge base. The syntax of ALCK, as in <ref> [5] </ref>, admits the epistemic operator before any concept and role expression of the language ALC. <p> The first parameter is actually used to characterize a family of epistemic concept languages, while the preference criterion is defined according to the idea of minimal knowledge. Let us first consider the special case corresponding to the semantics adopted in <ref> [5] </ref>. We choose an accessibility relation such that R = W fi W, thus obtaining to the so-called universal S5 structures. In this case worlds and interpretation coincide and one can avoid the introduction of V. <p> Notice that this semantics can be viewed as the natural extension of the semantics of rules given in <ref> [5] </ref>, where rules apply only to the known individuals in the knowledge base. Such formalization of rules is in fact the same obtained by applying emb to justification-free defaults. As shown below, this translation is faithful for every logic ALCK (S G ).

Reference-contexts: A justification-free default is a default where the justification part is empty, i.e. of the form ff : We are interested in the translation of a default theory into a modal theory. Therefore we give the following definitions (taken from <ref> [7] </ref>). Definition 1. <p> As pointed out by Gottlob <ref> [7] </ref>, not every translation that is faithful is useful in practice. In particular, we would like to be able to turn each default into a modal sentence, independently of other defaults and of the theory. Such translations are called modular. Definition 2.

Given a modal logic S such that K S S4F , there exists a faithful modular translation from default logic to the ground nonmonotonic logic S G . Sketch of the proof. (For the detailed proof see <ref> [15] </ref>) First, it is shown that if S is a default extension for the default theory (D; W ), then ST (S) is an S G - expansion for emb (D; W ) for any modal logic S such that K S S5. <p> the other hand, none of the propositional defaults corresponding to the set U D can be applied, because of the presence of the conjunct O in the prerequisite: consequently, o is a faithful translation for default theories under the semantics of Baader and Hollunder. ut Since a preferred model (see <ref> [15] </ref>) is always an S5-model (given that every S G -expansion is a stable expansion), the use of a different accessibility relation affects the epistemic models of the knowledge base, but does not change the interpretation of the epistemic operator in the queries.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Concept languages (also called terminological logics, description languages) have been studied in the past years to provide a formal characterization of frame-based system. However, while the fragment of first-order logic which characterizes the most popular constructs of these languages has been clearly identified (see for example <ref> [25] </ref>), there is not yet consensus on the practical aspects of frame systems that cannot be formalized in a classical first-order setting.
