Reference-contexts: This amounts to creating a concept-system for the real world. The CCAT group is different from other groups in the PEIRCE project because CCAT is not about representation or implementation, rather it is about the actual content that needs to be represented. Sowa's theory of Conceptual Graphs (CG) <ref> [Sowa 84] </ref> is more than a variant of First Order Logic. <p> Appendix B of <ref> [Sowa 84] </ref> had lists of potentially useful basic concepts and relations. <p> CCAT definitions are to be at a deeper level, and will include a canonical basis constraining the types of participants in relations. <ref> [Sowa 84] </ref> The job of CCAT is thus enormous at the start and never-ending. CCAT needs to build not only a generic ontology for the common-sense world, but also some more specific concepts as targets for certain practical projects now underway by various PEIRCE participants.

Reference: [-q] <editor> This turns off all screen reports while Morph is active. </editor> <title> Use this option when playing hundreds or thousands of games in one learning session, otherwise I/O actually slows down execution tremendously. Default: FALSE, </title> <note> verbosity is on. </note>
Reference: [-s #full ply] <editor> Dash s determines the Search range of a Morph APS Agent if selected during an interactive prompt. </editor> <title> The current Search module is a full-depth Search system, that will Search at the given ply specified in the argument, e.g. "-s 4" will Search 4 ply. The current TPL version is only working at 1 and 2 ply due to a coding bug still being worked on.

Reference-contexts: While this work was significant in the area of database relations, functional dependencies do not by any means constitute all constraints. Significant work was done during the 1980s to systematise the approach, e.g. <ref> [2] </ref>, [22]. Later efforts have focussed on the at least partially automating the integration process, generally with ER or ER enhanced, although many of the ideas are generic [39], [40].

Reference-contexts: The focus of this paper is on the conceptual schema integration level. In this area most work has been done using the relational and entity relationship (ER) [5] data models <ref> [3] </ref>. The claim for ER is that one can represent more semantics. However weaknesses in its representation power have prompted proposals using logic-based models.

Levinson, editors, </editor> <booktitle> Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Peirce: A Conceptual Graphs Workbench, </booktitle> <year> 1993. </year>
Reference-contexts: In this section we shall examine some of the mechanisms that realises this satisfaction. In [8] we demonstrated that ER could be translated to conceptual graphs (a bijection). In <ref> [6] </ref> we further demonstrated that the same could be achieved for NIAM, thus effectively permitting integration with schema conflict. If we examine the mapping from ER to conceptual graphs and some of the subsequent conflict resolution we can show the usefulness of conceptual graphs in the integration process.

Reference-contexts: However weaknesses in its representation power have prompted proposals using logic-based models. We have previously proposed conceptual graphs as a basis for schema integration [8] and also shown that conceptual graphs satisfy certain criteria as a canonical data model <ref> [7] </ref>. Earlier work which contributed towards constraint integration simply took functional dependencies and formed a minimal set of functional dependencies. While this work was significant in the area of database relations, functional dependencies do not by any means constitute all constraints. <p> While we need a single representation, we must allow for any number of external schemas. Semantic relativism is the degree to which all the different conceptualisations of the same real world can be accommodated. 2.4 Using Conceptual Graphs In <ref> [7] </ref> we have pointed out that conceptual graphs satisfied the criteria for a canonical data model. In this section we shall examine some of the mechanisms that realises this satisfaction. In [8] we demonstrated that ER could be translated to conceptual graphs (a bijection).
