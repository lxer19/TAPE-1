Abstract: Experimental Results of Sensor Based Planning for Hyper-redundant Manipulators Nobuaki Takanashi* Howie Chosety and Joel W. Burdickz ABSTRACT: This paper presents a dual-resolution local sensor based planning method for hyper-redundant robot mechanisms. Two classes of sensor feedback control methods, working at different sampling rates and different spatial resolutions, are considered: full shape modification (FSM), and partial shape modification (PSM). FSM and PSM cooperate to utilize a mechanism's hyper-redundancy to enable both local obstacle avoidance and end-effector placement in real time. These methods have been implemented on a thirty degree of freedom hyper-redundant manipulator which has eleven ultrasonic distance measurement sensors and twenty infrared proximity sensors. The implementation of these algorithms in a dual CPU real time control computer, an innovative sensor bus architecture, and a novel graphical control interface are described. Experimental results obtained using this test bed show the efficacy of the proposed method.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction This paper presents preliminary experimental results in the area of local sensor based planning for hyper-redundant robot manipulators. Recall from <ref> [ChB90b] </ref> that a "hyper-redundant" manipulator is a kinematically redundant manipulator in which the degree of redundancy is very large or infinite. <p> In this paper, the local sensor based planning algorithms of hyper-redundant manipulators are based on the hyper-redundant kinematic analysis found in <ref> [ChB90b, ChB91a, ChB92a, ChB92c, Ch] </ref>. More importantly, we demonstrate these algorithms on an actual 30 degree-of-freedom hyper-redundant robot system. A more detailed account of this mechanism and its capabilities can be found in [ChB92b]. <p> Many of these algorithms can be extended to the spatial case. Section 4 describes the experimental setup, while Section 5 described the actual results of these experiments. 2. Background This section reviews a hyper-redundant robot kinematic analysis framework that forms the basis of this work. Recall from <ref> [ChB90b] </ref> that we assume that (regardless of mechanical implementation) the important macroscopic features of a hyper-redundant robot can be captured by a backbone curve. A backbone curve parametrization and an associated set of reference frames which evolve along the curve are collectively called the backbone reference set. <p> A backbone curve parametrization and an associated set of reference frames which evolve along the curve are collectively called the backbone reference set. In this paradigm, inverse kinematics and task planning reduces to the determination of the proper time varying behavior of the backbone reference set <ref> [ChB90b] </ref>. Similarly, local sensor based planning is equivalent in this approach to modification of the backbone curve shape in order to accommodate impinging obstacles. In [ChB92c],many techniques are introduced for parametrizing the backbone curve.

Reference-contexts: Electrostatic type ultrasonic sound transducers determine distance by measuring the time of flight of the ultrasound pulse leaving the transducer, bouncing off an object and returning to the sensor. A 50kHz sonar wave burst is transmitted when the sonar-ranging module is triggered <ref> [Ci] </ref>. The ranging module output is connected to the sensor bus interrupt request line. The echo return time is computed by the CPU hardware counter. Since the sixteen bit resolution distance measurement result is read from the hardware counter, no result is ever sent through the sensor bus. <p> These sensors are calibrated to measure distances ranging from 10cm to 2.5m, with a 2% accuracy. There is about twenty degrees of conical ambiguity for direction, because of the transmitting beam pattern of the transducer <ref> [Ci] </ref>. In this work, it is assumed that the obstacle lies along the cone's centerline, which is locally normal to the backbone curve at the point of sensor attachment. The IR sensors yield binary proximity information-i.e., the presence or absence of the obstacle in some pre-set range.
