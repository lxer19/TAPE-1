Title: The Learning Web: A System View and an Agent-Oriented Model  
Author: Douglas H. Norrie and Brian R. Gaines 
Address: Alberta, Canada T2N 1N4  
Affiliation: University of Calgary  
Abstract: The notion of a learning society has long been promoted as the next stage of evolution of the educational system from the inculation of skills and knowledge to the development of capacities which enable people to learn continuously for the rest of their lives. This evolutionary step is vital to the continued health of human societies in a postmodern age of rapid and unceasing change where the certainties of the past have been replaced by the uncertainties of a future that requires continuous learning. The move to a learning society requires changes in personal attitudes and the educational infrastructure. It also requires major technological support to provide open access to a learning environment for all people, in all places at all times. This paper presents progress in the development of the Learning Web, an agent-oriented network supporting knowledge access, collaboration and simulation, in order to provide a widely accessible learning environment. The essence of the Learning Web is an open architecture supporting integration of heterogeneous subsystems in which their is a natural symbiosis between human and computer agents.

Reference-contexts: This is the paradigm of the computer-based intelligent agent developing from research in distributed artificial intelligence. By integrating this new approach with recent developments in telecommunications, distributed computing, knowledge databases, language translators, and multimedia systems, a transparent learning environment can be created which will allow the often-foretold learning society <ref> (Boshier, 1980) </ref> to become a reality. This environment can be regarded as a virtual learning environment, since the user interacts with visualizations and other simulacra creating an apparent physical reality. The intelligent interconnected network through which the learning environment can be created will here be called the Learning Web .

Mediator Agent An agent which acts to coordinate the activities of other agents and to resolve conflicts between them. Some of the activities requiring coordination within distributed agent systems are planning, task building and contracting, negotiation, task allocation, assessment of solutions.

Reference-contexts: By providing each object with a knowledge base and the capability to infer or reason from this knowledge base, the objectoriented paradigm becomes extended to the agent-oriented one (Shoham, 1993; Kwok and Norrie, 1992). Objectoriented languages and architectures can thus be extended into agent-oriented ones <ref> (Kwok and Norrie, 1994a) </ref>. The architecture or structure of a multi-agent system or subsystem - essentially defines the allowable interactions (e.g. who can communicate with whom, send what information, request or control cooperation).

The system is known as The Mediator <ref> (Gaines and Norrie, 1994) </ref>. Mediator is a system designed to coordinate an overall application project over the whole life cycle from requirements to completion. In particular, it can support the integration of computer-based subsystems within a mutually collaborative framework.

Reference-contexts: The intelligent interconnected network through which the learning environment can be created will here be called the Learning Web . This type of intelligent network is already being foreshadowed by the new agent-based smart networks being developed commercially <ref> (Reinhardt, 1994) </ref>. 2 What will evolve can best be envisaged by extrapolation from the present. Consider the socalled information highway as a starting point. <p> A recent survey of agent architectures and languages provides further details (Wooldridge and Jennings, 1994). An earlier survey with a more applied focus provides also some developmental background (Norrie and Kwok, 1992). Of particular relevance to this paper, agent-based Wide Area Networks are already being developed <ref> (Reinhardt, 1994) </ref>. 5 A stimulus to the development of multi-agent systems was provided by the objectoriented programming paradigm, in which objects are software modules which send and receive messages and take action (typically the sending of a message) according to hard-coded programmed instructions.

Reference-contexts: For example, there would be groups for history, science, mathematics, or health, with subdivisions according to sub-fields and ability level.

This usage would include interface agents as mediators and is quite different to the usage in this paper.
