Abstract: Mobility support in IP networks requires the use of servers to forward packets to mobile hosts and to maintain information pertaining to a mobile hosts location in the network. In one proposed protocol, the mobile-IP protocol, location and packet forwarding functions are provided by servers referred to as home agents. These home agents may become the bottleneck when there are a large number of mobile hosts in the network. In this paper, we consider the design and analysis of load balancing mechanisms for multiple home agents in the mobile-IP protocol. We propose a load balancing scheme in which a home agent may periodically transfer the control of a mobile host to another home agent in the same network through the use of functions supported in mobile-IP. The periodicity with which this transfer is performed affects the load balancing gain as well as the associated overhead. We analyze our load balancing mechanism under bursty traffic arrival conditions using a Markov Modulated Poisson Process. The results show that the proposed load balancing scheme can yield modest gains over alternative load balancing strategies.

Reference-contexts: In order for the mobile host to receive messages at its new location, it must obtain an IP address in the new network, and messages sent to the original IP address need to be forwarded to the new IP address. In the mobile-IP protocol <ref> [1] </ref>, this support is provided by two servers, namely, the foreign agent and the home agent. A foreign agents supports the mobile host in the foreign network, while the home agent maintains the mobility binding and forwards packets to the mobile host when it has roamed out of the network. <p> The results from the queueing analysis are discussed in Section 5 and compared to simulation results. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude this paper and discuss some key future research directions. 2 Mobile-IP Protocol The basic mobile-IP protocol <ref> [1] </ref> has evolved out of the efforts of the mobile-IP working group. The basic mobile-IP protocol defines the following entities: 1. Mobile Host: an IP host that, by virtue of its mobility, changes its point of attachment to the network.

Reference-contexts: One way to improve the mobile IP protocol is route optimization <ref> [2] </ref> in which the messages are routed directly to the care-of address instead of first sending the message to the home agent. This is accomplished by having the correspondent host maintain a binding cache which contains the care-of addresses for the mobile hosts to which it is sending mes sages.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A key objective in providing mobility support is to ensure that mobile hosts are able to send and receive messages when they move within a network or from one network to another. In IP networks, routing is based on the IP address of the host <ref> [3] </ref>. When a host moves from one IP subnet to another, all IP packets addressed to that host will be routed to the hosts old network. <p> When the foreign agent receives the packet, it updates it own table and relays the reply to the mobile host. In the home network, the home agent uses a gratuitous ARP <ref> [3] </ref> to update the ARP cache of all hosts and routers that currently have a cache entry for the mobile host. <p> The home agent acts as a proxy for the mobile host, and responds to ARP queries for the mobile host with a proxy ARP reply <ref> [3] </ref>. The result is that the mobile hosts IP address is now bound to the link layer address of the home agent.

Reference-contexts: The gains are highest when there is a high level of burstiness, which is the case for TCP/IP traffic. This work may be extended to the case in which the underlying network is an ATM network <ref> [8] </ref>. In this situation, IP to ATM address translations are performed by an entity known as the Address Resolution Protocol server (ARP server). This centralized server may be used to implement better load balancing schemes by keeping track of ATM connections and balancing the load on an ATM connection level.

Reference-contexts: In this analysis, we assume that the two arrival processes are independent. Furthermore, instead of solving a two priority queueing model, we will use the shadow server approximation proposed in <ref> [9] </ref> to analyze two priority queues. In this approximation, we will aggregate the high priority traffic by appropriately modifying the service time of the data packets.
