Abstract: This paper appears in the Proceedings of the Fifth NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Conference on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies, Sept., 1996. This paper available at http://www.isi.edu/netstation/ Derived Virtual Devices: A Secure Distributed File System Abstract This paper presents the design of derived virtual devices (DVDs). DVDs are the mechanism used by the Netstation Project to provide secure shared access to network-attached peripherals distributed in an untrusted network environment. DVDs improve Input/Output efficiency by allowing user processes to perform I/O operations directly from devices without intermediate transfer through the controlling operating system kernel. The security enforced at the device through the DVD mechanism includes resource boundary checking, user authentication, and restricted operations, e.g. read-only access. To illustrate the application of DVDs, we present the interactions between a network-attached disk and a file system designed to exploit the DVD abstraction. We further discuss third-party transfer as a mechanism intended to provide for efficient data transfer in a typical NAP environment. We show how DVDs facilitate third-party transfer, and provide the security required in a more open network environment.

Reference-contexts: Communication via a local area network (LAN) provides flexibility in system design and avoids the problems of shared-bus communication, while allowing us to exploit the ever-increasing aggregate bandwidth provided by high-speed networks. These advantages are changing the way computer system architectures are defined <ref> [1] </ref>, and we see NAPs becoming a significant component of new storage systems [2, 3] and new multimedia architectures [4, 5]. However, components of a system built around a LAN cannot depend on the tight coupling and simplifying assumptions provided by a bus-based architecture.

Reference-contexts: Each NVD is managed individually (i.e. it has 2 a name and a description in a device management database), even though multiple devices may reside at the same network interface 2 . We have chosen to use Internet Domain Names <ref> [8] </ref> to identify NVDs on the network. The DNS can then provide the mapping from device name to the address of the network interface where the device resides.

Reference-contexts: case of a parent NVD, the constraints placed on the Device Command Set must be obtained from the configuration information maintained by the local Netstation management database (i.e. the NVDM). 4 DVDs are related to the concept of virtual store as defined in the Open Storage Systems Interconnection (OSSI) model <ref> [9] </ref>. Differences are noted in section 7. <p> As already discussed, DVDs have much in common with virtual stores from the IEEE Open Systems Storage Interconnect model <ref> [9, 17] </ref>. DVDs differ from virtual stores in several respects. DVDs do not support composite devices, while a virtual store may represent striping across more than one disk, for example.

Reference-contexts: Because a DVD presents the same interface as its parent, it is possible to run systems in a recursive fashion; file systems can be built on DVDs created by other instances of the file system, as in stackable filing <ref> [10] </ref>, or window systems can be run on virtual displays that are actually windows on larger virtual displays, much like Plan 9's 8-1/2 [11].

For example, nesting is also used when the file server grants access to a user process, which can then grant access to other devices to facilitate third-party transfer, as described in section 5. Section 2.3 introduced the two types of DVD RPCs: DVD Management Procedures and DVD Command Sets.

Reference-contexts: Our prototype DVD creation mechanism is based on Scheme <ref> [15] </ref>. The DVD creator downloads Scheme code at create time, specifying a Scheme function to be executed before and after the execution of each command at the NVD, to adjust argument values (block addresses, etc.) and determine if permissions would be violated by executing the command.

Reference-contexts: One DVD can transfer data to another. This can be done by creating two DVDs, one for the source and one for the destination, that each linearize the area to be transferred, creating a virtual mapping window in a fashion similar to the Parallel Transport Protocol (PTP) <ref> [16] </ref>. As with PTP, the mapping to create the virtual mapping window is done at the storage server, rather than at the device. However, using DVDs, this mapping is then communicated to the devices in the form of the creation of child DVDs.
