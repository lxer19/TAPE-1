Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The HiRes detector <ref> [1] </ref> detects the air fluorescence light generated by the air showers nearby the detector and therefore images the longitudinal development of showers.

Reference-contexts: The most commonly used weight is the tube signal intensity since tubes right on the plane should have larger signals. A different way of doing plane fit is described by Elbert <ref> [2] </ref>. The technique can be summarized as following: (1). Determine the centroid of all the fired tube directions. (2). Project all the fired tubes onto the plane perpendicular to the centroid. (3) Do a line fit on the projected tube positions (and calculate the error if you want). (4).

Reference-contexts: That's the motivation we perform the shower-mirror-plane fit on the basis of the global plane fit. By correcting the tube response and then summing up the signals in the angular bin, we are able to get much smooth signal profile. 3.2 Shower profile fit We choose the Gaisser-Hillas function <ref> [3] </ref> to describe the longitudinal shower profile. N (x) = N max x x o (X max x o )= where N max is the maximum shower size, X max is depth at shower maximum, x o is the depth of first interaction and = 70gcm 2 .

Reference-contexts: So we will do a detour on the light generation first. 3.2.1 Monte carlo signal generations Four basic mechanisms contribute to the generation of the light signal seen by the Fly's Eye type detector <ref> [4] </ref> : nitrogen fluorescence, direct Cerenkov light, air molecule (Rayleigh) scattered Cerenkov light and aerosol (Mie) scattered Cerenkov light. Of these, fluorescence relates most directly to the local number of charged particles in a shower.

Reference-contexts: Simple kinetic theory arguments relate the fluorescence efficiencies at various pressures. The resultant fluorescent yield integrated over our spectral response is only mildly altitude and temperature dependent. Bunner <ref> [5] </ref> has combined all known data up to 1963 and extracted best fits for the fluorescence spectrum of air at tropospheric pressures of interest to this experiment. The scintillation light yield is only 4.03 photons per meter at the HiRes Prototype altitude.

Reference-contexts: However, the large number of particles in the shower makes the detection feasible for extremely high energy cosmic rays. The fluorescence light is emitted isotropically from the shower, allowing for detection of showers at large distances. Loh et al <ref> [6] </ref> 4 [7] conducted an experiment recently in Tokyo to remeasure the scintillation efficiency and their numbers applied to the profile reconstruction yield less than 5% shift in the primary energy and 10g=cm 2 shift in X max compared to Bunner's numbers.

Reference-contexts: Studies of multiple scattering show that the angular distribution of ionizing particles averaged over the length of the EAS can be represented by : d e = 0 where 1 0 = aE b T . The Fly's Eye Group have measured 0 directly using stereo data <ref> [13] </ref> and find 0 = 4:0 1:2 ffi , in agreement with the above calculations. The parameters from Stanev et al are the ones currently used by Fly's Eye and HiRes Monte Carlo and reconstruction programs.
