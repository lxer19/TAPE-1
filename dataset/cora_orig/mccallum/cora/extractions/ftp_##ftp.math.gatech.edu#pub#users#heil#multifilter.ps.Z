Abstract: Multiwavelets are a new addition to the body of wavelet theory. Realizable as matrix-valued filter banks leading to wavelet bases, multiwavelets offer simultaneous orthogonality, symmetry, and short support, which is not possible with scalar 2-channel wavelet systems. After reviewing this recently developed theory, we examine the use of multiwavelets in a filter bank setting for discrete-time signal and image processing. Multiwavelets differ from scalar wavelet systems in requiring two or more input streams to the multiwavelet filter bank. We describe two methods (repeated row and approximation/deapproximation) for obtaining such a vector input stream from a one-dimensional signal. Algorithms for symmetric extension of signals at boundaries are then developed, and naturally integrated with approximation-based preprocessing. We describe an additional algorithm for multiwavelet processing of two-dimensional signals, two rows at a time, and develop a new family of multiwavelets (the constrained pairs) that is well-suited to this approach. This suite of novel techniques is then applied to two basic signal processing problems, denoising via wavelet-shrinkage, and data compression. After developing the approach via model problems in one dimension, we applied multiwavelet processing to images, frequently obtaining performance superior to the comparable scalar wavelet transform.

Reference-contexts: As in the scalar case, one can find the conditions of orthogonality and approximation for multiwavelets [36, 37, 20, 29]; this is discussed below. A very important multiwavelet system was constructed by J. Geronimo, D. Hardin, and P. Massopust [16] (see <ref> [1] </ref> for another early multiwavelet construction). Their system contains the two scaling functions 3 1 (t); 2 (t) shown in Figure 1 and the two wavelets w 1 (t); w 2 (t) shown in Figure 2. <p> D [0] = 10 4 2 3 p 3 1 2 9 p 2 10 3 D [2] = 10 4 2 3 p 3 1 2 1 p 2 0 3 There are four remarkable properties of the Geronimo-Hardin-Massopust scaling functions: * They each have short support (the intervals <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and [0; 2]). * Both scaling functions are symmetric, and the wavelets form a symmetric/antisymmetric pair. * All integer translates of the scaling functions are orthogonal. * The system has second order of approximation (locally constant and locally linear functions are in V 0 ). <p> Moreover, a solution of a scalar dilation equation with four coefficients is supported on the interval [0; 3]! Other useful orthogonal multiwavelet systems with second order approximation are the symmetric pair determined by three coefficients C [0] = 6 0 2+ 7 0 2 7 3 5 ; C <ref> [1] </ref> = 6 3 1 1 3 3 5 ; C [2] = 6 2 7 2+ 7 3 5 and the Chui-Lian pair [6] determined by the coefficients C [0] = 6 1 2 7 p 4 7 2 4 0 1 7 2 4 2 2 p 4 7 <p> Moreover, the Chui-Lian symmetric/antisymmetric scaling functions are the sum and difference of the two functions from the symmetric pair. In this article we will make use of several other nonsymmetric multiwavelets with desirable properties.

Depending on the parity of the input signal (even- or odd-length) and the parity and symmetry of the filter, there is a specific non-expansive symmetric extension of both the input signal and the subband outputs.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Wavelets are a useful tool for signal processing applications such as image compression and denoising. Until recently, only scalar wavelets were known: wavelets generated by one scaling function. But one can imagine a situation when there is more than one scaling function <ref> [16] </ref>. This leads to the notion of multiwavelets, which have several advantages in comparison to scalar wavelets [36]. Such features as short support, orthogonality, symmetry, and vanishing moments are known to be important in signal processing. A scalar wavelet cannot possess all these properties at the same time [35]. <p> As in the scalar case, one can find the conditions of orthogonality and approximation for multiwavelets [36, 37, 20, 29]; this is discussed below. A very important multiwavelet system was constructed by J. Geronimo, D. Hardin, and P. Massopust <ref> [16] </ref> (see [1] for another early multiwavelet construction). Their system contains the two scaling functions 3 1 (t); 2 (t) shown in Figure 1 and the two wavelets w 1 (t); w 2 (t) shown in Figure 2. <p> A multiwavelet filter bank [36] has "taps" that are N fi N matrices (in this paper, we will be working with N = 2). Our principal example is the 4-coefficient symmetric multiwavelet filter bank whose lowpass filter was reported in <ref> [16] </ref>. This filter is given by the four 2 fi 2 matrices C [k] of equation (3).

Reference-contexts: The solution to the matrix dilation equation (1) is a two-element vector of scaling functions (t) = [ 1 (t); 2 (t)] T .

Reference-contexts: As in the scalar case, one can find the conditions of orthogonality and approximation for multiwavelets <ref> [36, 37, 20, 29] </ref>; this is discussed below. A very important multiwavelet system was constructed by J. Geronimo, D. Hardin, and P. Massopust [16] (see [1] for another early multiwavelet construction). <p> If the matrix L has eigenvalues 1; 1 2 ; : : :; 1 and the corresponding eigenvectors have a special form, then polynomials of degree less than p belong to the space V 0 <ref> [20, 29] </ref>. <p> Then constant functions f (t) c locally belong to the scale-limited space V 0 . It has been shown <ref> [20] </ref> that the repeated constant 1 is an eigenvalue of the filtering and downsampling operator L, and there exists a left eigenvector [u n ] = : : : u 1;n ; u 2;n ; u 1;n+1 ; u 2;n+1 ; : : : with [u n ] L = [u <p> Quantization of these lowpass multifilter outputs (for lossy compression) will then introduce a rippled texture in the lowpass part of the image, creating unacceptable artifacts. This is borne out by experiments using the GHM multifilter (Section 6.4 below). Similar arguments hold for linear approximation <ref> [20] </ref>: a multiwavelet system has linear approximation (accuracy of order p = 2) if and only if there are two left eigenvectors. <p> Consider a multiwavelet system with two scaling functions satisfying a matrix dilation equation with four coefficients (t) = 1 (t) # = C [0](2t) + C [1](2t 1) + C [2](2t 2) + C [3](2t 3) : It is proven in <ref> [20] </ref> that the vectors u = [u 1;0 u 2;0 ] ; y = [y 1;0 y 2;0 ] must satisfy the following system of equations: u (C [0] + C [2]) = u yC [1] + (u + y)C [3] = 1 yC [0] + (u + y)C [2] =

Reference-contexts: Heuristically, wavelet shrinkage has the advantage of not adding "bumps" or false oscillations in the process of removing noise, because of the local and smoothness-preserving nature of the wavelet transform. Wavelet shrinkage has been successfully applied to SAR imagery as a method for clutter removal <ref> [28] </ref>. It is natural to attempt to use multiwavelets as the transform for a wavelet shrinkage approach to denoising, and compare the results with scalar wavelet shrinkage.

Reference-contexts: This leads to the notion of multiwavelets, which have several advantages in comparison to scalar wavelets [36]. Such features as short support, orthogonality, symmetry, and vanishing moments are known to be important in signal processing. A scalar wavelet cannot possess all these properties at the same time <ref> [35] </ref>. On the other hand, a multiwavelet system can simultaneously provide perfect reconstruction while preserving length (orthogonality), good performance at the boundaries (via linear-phase symmetry), and a high order of approximation (vanishing moments). Thus multiwavelets offer the possibility of superior performance for image processing applications, compared with scalar wavelets.

Reference-contexts: Until recently, only scalar wavelets were known: wavelets generated by one scaling function. But one can imagine a situation when there is more than one scaling function [16]. This leads to the notion of multiwavelets, which have several advantages in comparison to scalar wavelets <ref> [36] </ref>. Such features as short support, orthogonality, symmetry, and vanishing moments are known to be important in signal processing.

A multiwavelet filter bank <ref> [36] </ref> has "taps" that are N fi N matrices (in this paper, we will be working with N = 2). Our principal example is the 4-coefficient symmetric multiwavelet filter bank whose lowpass filter was reported in [16]. <p> Unlike a scalar 2-band paraunitary filter bank, the corresponding highpass filter (specified by the four 2 fi 2 matrices D [k] of equation (4)) cannot be obtained simply as an "alternating flip" of the lowpass filter; the wavelet filters D [k] must be designed <ref> [36] </ref>. The resulting 2-channel, 2 fi 2 matrix filter bank operates on two input data streams, filtering them into four output streams, each of which is downsampled by a factor of 2. This is shown in Figure 5.
