Abstract: This paper presents the highpass mean removal ensemble data (HMRED) method, for identification of human joint dynamics. This method is shown to be more robust to inter-trial variation than previous ensemble mean removal ensemble data (EMRED) methods. The HM-RED method is also compared to the single-trial exponentially weighted least squares (EWLS) method. Under similar conditions, EWLS can track parameter variations up to 1 Hz, the HMRED method up to 5 Hz. The HM-RED and EWLS methods were verified against each other by applying them to the same experimental data.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Although EWLS [4] requires only a single trial, its tracking capability is limited to low frequencies. Ensemble data methods can track faster variations of a system dynamics provided that the trials are lined up properly <ref> [2] </ref>. We have found that previous EMRED methods are not very robust to inter-trial variation, because the mean movement is calculated from ensemble data. In this paper we present a robust ensemble (HMRED) method, and compare the effect of inter-trial variation to the EMRED method. <p> By contrast, the mean error of the HMRED method does not, indicating its robustness. 2) Figure 2 shows the variance accounted for (VAF) <ref> [2] </ref> of prediction error and the smallest VAF of the mean and variance of I, B and K of the EWLS and HMRED methods.

Reference-contexts: The latter is higher than normal human arm movements. Experiments The EWLS and HMRED methods were applied to identify the elbow joint dynamics during movement. The airjet perturbation device reported in <ref> [3] </ref> was strapped to the subject's wrist. The airjet force was recorded, and wrist motion was recorded by an OPTOTRAK T M position measurement system. The subject was instructed to track a target point moving along a circular arc in a vertical plane 30 o about a vertical line.
