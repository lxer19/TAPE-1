Abstract: MAGENTA (Mobile AGENT for Administration) is our mobile agent environment for network management. The MAGENTA environment is being developed under the action Astrolog fl which is a highly dynamic and decentralized management system meant for the management of Astrolab, a distributed system comprising of heterogeneous machines running varied operating systems connected by a LAN. The MAGENTA environment enables the introduction of a unique idea of a Mobile Network Manager(MNM).

Reference-contexts: Java also provides the capability of native methods to access the local operating system and thus is ideally suited for obtaining system information. Because of these reasons Java has been recently used for network management applications like MIB browsing <ref> (AdventNet. 1997) </ref>. Java also provides the capability of deriving meaningful meta-variables from the available SNMP variables to the local managers enabling them to monitor the local domains more effectively.

Reference-contexts: Each of the cells have a Mobile Support Station (MSS) of their own. The responsibility of serving the Mobile Host (MH) as it moves from one cell to another cell changes from one MSS to another <ref> (Bakre, Badrinath. 1994) </ref>(Markku et al. 1995). The utilization of a static proxy serves us in good stead. The mobile agent as launched by the portable computer (MH) goes to the proxy which in turn obtains the required information.

Reference-contexts: An effort has been made in (Jennings, Wooldridge 1994) to study the hallmarks of agent-hood. The hallmarks have been put down namely as autonomy, social ability, responsiveness and pro-activeness. The agents available are numerous and differ substantially in their functionality and performance. In <ref> (Beale et al. 1994) </ref>, an effort to classify the various types of available agents has been made. The various types of agents have been classified as user agents, agent guides, autonomous agents, symbiotic and cooperative agents, anthropomorphic agents, agents for multi-agent systems, and agents for agent-oriented programming.

Reference-contexts: implementation details before concluding. 2 OVERVIEW OF INTELLIGENT MOBILE AGENTS In lieu of the client-server paradigm which has not been able to cope with the various kinds of demands put on it, the mobile agent based computing approach has been propounded as the possible approach to the next generation computing <ref> (Colin et al. 1995) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In the case of network management, they have been proposed for Telecommunication management Network (TMN) as in (Magedanz et al. 1996) and as generalized scripted and delegated agents for management in <ref> (Goldzmith, Yemini 1995) </ref>. In (Goldzmith, Yemini 1995) the mobile agents are sent to remote sites where they are incorporated into the local network management program and are used for intelligent tasks like MIB (Management Information Base) filtering. <p> In the case of network management, they have been proposed for Telecommunication management Network (TMN) as in (Magedanz et al. 1996) and as generalized scripted and delegated agents for management in <ref> (Goldzmith, Yemini 1995) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The implementation of MAGENTA environment is nearing completion. A small agent demonstrator has been implemented. The MAGENTA environment is written in Java and utilizes Java Object Serialization of JDK1.1.1. The agents are Java classes which migrate between the lieus which are integrated with the managers. Java <ref> (Gosling, McGilton. 1995) </ref> was chosen for implementation of MNM and MAGENTA because it is architecturally neutral. It was intended to have multiple managers accessing the server from a variety of platforms, thus only the local managers needed to be platform-independent.

Reference-contexts: MNMs we propose are managers that run on portable computers which can either run in the tethered mode using a PPP/SLIP mechanism or can run on a roaming wireless computer <ref> (Gray et al. 1996) </ref>. Our design takes care of both the situations. What distinguishes these mobile computers are the extreme constraints on the link available to them.

Reference-contexts: These are mostly one hop agents and they are used to avoid transfer of data over the network and to execute management logic close to the remote site. However, these agents are not generic and are not portable. In <ref> (Krause 1997) </ref> the mobile agents are used to ameliorate the service scalability problem inherent in Intelligent Networks. They intend to utilize the mobile agent technology to provide telecommunication services instantly and to be customized directly at the locations where the intelligence is needed.

Reference-contexts: In the stronger notion of agency the agents along with the above mentioned capabilities are intended to possess human like qualities and behaviour, specially in the field of AI. The agents are endowed with notions like knowl Overview of Network Management Systems 3 edge, belief, intention and obligation <ref> (Reilly, Bates 1995) </ref>.
