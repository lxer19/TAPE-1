Abstract: Parallel Genetic Algorithms have often been reported to yield better performance than Genetic Algorithms which use a single large panmictic population. In the case of the Island Model Genetic Algorithm, it has been informally argued that having multiple subpopulations helps to preserve genetic diversity, since each island can potentially follow a different search trajectory through the search space. On the other hand, linearly separable functions have often been used to test Island Model Genetic Algorithms; it is possible that Island Models are particular well suited to separable problems. We look at how Island Models can track multiple search trajectories using the infinite population models of the simple genetic algorithm. We also introduce a simple model for better understanding when Island Model Genetic Algorithms may have an advantage when processing linearly separable problems.

Reference-contexts: This may be true regardless of whether the target problems are separable or not. Thus we expect that an algorithm such as CHC <ref> [3] </ref> would be a better choice. Scaling up the population (which is usually set to 50 for CHC) rarely improves performance for CHC, or improves performance only modestly. Thus, it should be a very good candidate for a search engine for use in Island Model Genetic Algorithms.

Reference-contexts: As already seen in the experiments using infinite population models, a genetic algorithms can converge toward 0000 in some circumstances and toward 1111 in other situations. This makes this an interesting test function for island models. Goldberg, Korb and Deb <ref> [5] </ref> defined a 30 bit function constructed from 10 copies of a fully deceptive 3-bit function. The problem is made more difficult when the bits are arranged so that each of the 3 bits of the subfunctions are uniformly and maximally distributed across the encoding.

Reference-contexts: Mutation is not used in these experiments, since we wanted to better isolate genetic diversity resulting from the interaction between islands. 2.1 The Infinite Population Model Vose [13] uses the function G to represent the trajectory of the infinite population simple genetic algorithm <ref> [6] </ref>. The function G acts on a vector, p, where component p i of the vector is the proportion of the population that samples string i. We denote the population at time t by p t .

Reference-contexts: The finite population Markov model on the other hand, is too expensive to actually execute except for extremely small problems and extremely small populations (e.g. <ref> [8] </ref>). One way in which we can introduce finite effects into the infinite population model is by initializing the infinite population model using a distribution taken from a finite population.

Reference-contexts: Parallel Island Models have often been reported to display better search performance than serial single population models, both in terms of the quality of the solution found as well as reduced effort as measured in terms of total number of evaluations corresponding to points sampled in the search space <ref> [9, 20] </ref>. One reason for the improved search quality is that the various "islands" maintain some degree of independence and thus explore different regions of the search space while at the same time sharing information by means of migration. <p> This can also be seen as a means of sustaining genetic diversity [11].

We examine whether Island Model Genetic Algorithms, in fact, do take advantage of the linear separability of a problem to improve performance by solving each subproblem separately in island populations and assembling the partial solutions into a complete solution through the use of migration.

The second linearly separable test function is Rastrigin's Function. f (x i j i=1;N ) = 10N + i=1 x 2 We used N = 10 and 10 bits per argument giving us a 100 bit representation. The bits of each argument are contiguous. <p> The migration interval in the table is the number of evaluations per island between migrations. The parameters in Table 1 were chosen to be the same as those used in a previous study by Starkweather, Whitley, and Mathias <ref> [11] </ref>. 30 trials were run for each parameter set. Each trial was run until a solution was found or until a total of 300; 000 function evaluations was reached for that trial. No mutation was used; the crossover rate was 1.0 since this is a steady-state genetic algorithm. Fig. 3.

Reference-contexts: We are well aware of the limitations of using separable problems for testing optimization search engines and have argued for more diverse types of test problems with different degrees of nonlinearity <ref> [16] </ref>. Island Model Genetic Algorithms typically use larger total population sizes; 10 subpopulations of size 50 would not be an unusual or unreasonable design.

Reference-contexts: In the case of Rastrigin's function the encoding is linear scaling from the binary representation without any real number encoding such as a separate mantissa. 4 Experimental Results The search engine in our experiments is GENITOR <ref> [17] </ref>, a steady-state genetic algorithm. Each problem was run with a fixed total population size of 5000 but with varying numbers of islands as shown in Table 1. The migration interval in the table is the number of evaluations per island between migrations.

Reference-contexts: Infinite population sizes are still assumed, however, after the initial generation. Thus, the trajectories only model the effects of having different starting points in the different subpopulations. Results for a 4 bit fully deceptive problem <ref> [18] </ref> are shown in Fig. 1 with a global optimum of 1111 and a local optimum of 0000. The exact function is also given in section 3.2 of this paper. The choice of a fully deceptive function is in no way critical to illustrate the computational behavior of the models.
