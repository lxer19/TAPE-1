Title: Learning to Prove: A Taxonomy of Objectives  
Author: Vincenzo Liberatore 
Abstract: We consider the educational objective of learning how to prove a statement in a mathematically rigorous way and we break down this educational objective into several partial objectives following the standard taxonomy of [Bloom, 1956]. Three advantages stem from this approach: first, the partial objectives are more manageable in the process of curriculum development; second, it is easier to individuate the teaching strategies that are most effective for each educational objective; and, finally, we discover some objectives that are often neglected, but are in fact surprisingly legitimate | these include the rote learning of proofs, the ability of interpreting mathematical statements, the analysis of proofs and proof techniques, and the ability of reading the current literature.

The generality of these objectives often causes great difficulty in learning because students are not familiar with the specific proofs that the general schemes intend to describe <ref> [Bloom, 1956] </ref>. We therefore conjecture that more basic educational objectives should precede the learning of universal proof schemes. 2 The preliminary objective we assume is the knowledge of specific proofs (objective 1.12 in [Bloom, 1956]), which is to say that students should be able to recall some proofs in all their <p> learning because students are not familiar with the specific proofs that the general schemes intend to describe <ref> [Bloom, 1956] </ref>.

Moreover, the student should be able to grasp the sequence of implications and quantifications of the statement she has to prove. The student should be able to distinguish among warranted, unwarranted, or contradictory conclusions drawn from the premises. <p> The student should be able to distinguish among warranted, unwarranted, or contradictory conclusions drawn from the premises. Test scores differentiating between "crude errors", "go-ing beyond the premises", and "over-caution" could be especially useful in monitoring a student progress <ref> [Bloom, 1956] </ref>. A student might sometimes come across a proof step that can be applied to situations of more general nature than the proof of a certain particular result. <p> We now compare and contrast the teaching methodologies that are most effective for the objectives of knowledge and of application. Suitable methods for the presentation and the acquisition of knowledge are lectures, printed material, and the like; these methods are usually preferred because of their simplicity <ref> [Bloom, 1956] </ref>. The most effective way to achieve the application objectives is the method of guided discovery, that is, by proceeding a step at a time and demonstrating the consequences that a particular decision, method, or strategy would bring about [Katona, 1967]. <p> Finally, she should acquire facility in reading a well-structured paper, as for example those published in journals. 4 3.4 Synthesis An educational objective for this level is the "ability to make mathematical discoveries and generalizations" <ref> [Bloom, 1956] </ref>. When synthesis is the main objective, the educational approach should be as non-direct and stimulating as possible, the reason being that at this level the greatest amount of intellectual growth should occur. <p> In particular, the student should feel free from tension and from pressure to adopt a particular viewpoint, and should be free to set his own objectives <ref> [Bloom, 1956] </ref>. 3.5 Evaluation At this level, the students should be able to judge the value, significance, and relevance of a proof.

Reference-contexts: She should also be able to carry out a proof when the proof technique to be used is suggested to her. Hints and directions need not be limited to suggestions for a good approach for solving the problem, but could also point out that some strategies are unproductive <ref> [Gagne, 1985] </ref>. The author has gained some experience in teaching a class that emphasizes among others the objectives listed in this section, and we believe that these objectives are not unrealistic for college freshmen and sophomores. <p> The achievement of some of the educational objectives pointed out in section 2 and 3.1 is a necessary prerequisite of the application objectives <ref> [Gagne, 1985] </ref>. Testing for the application objective requires some special attention.
