Title: An Improved Approximation Ratio for the Minimum Latency Problem  
Author: Michel Goemans Jon Kleinberg 
Abstract: Given a tour visiting n points in a metric space, the latency of one of these points p is the distance traveled in the tour before reaching p. The minimum latency problem asks for a tour passing through n given points for which the total latency of the n points is minimum; in effect, we are seeking the tour with minimum average "arrival time." This problem has been studied in the operations research literature, where it has also been termed the "delivery-man problem" and the "traveling repairman problem." The approximability of the minimum latency problem was first considered by Sahni and Gonzalez in 1976; however, unlike the classical traveling salesman problem, it is not easy to give any constant-factor approximation algorithm for the minimum latency problem. Recently, Blum, Chalasani, Coppersmith, Pulleyblank, Raghavan, and Sudan gave the first such algorithm, obtaining an approximation ratio of 144. In this work, we present an algorithm which improves this ratio to 21:55. The development of our algorithm involves a number of techniques that seem to be of interest from the perspective of the traveling salesman problem and its variants more generally.

Reference-contexts: We are interested in approximation algorithms for this problem for a number of reasons. First of all, the M LP is a reasonably well-studied problem in the operations research literature (e.g. <ref> [1, 8, 12, 13, 15] </ref>), where it is also known as the "delivery-man problem" and the "traveling repairman problem." The problem is also of interest from the point of view of on-line search problems; for example, as noted by Rivest and Yin (reported in [5]), if one is a searching for <p> We adapt a standard linear programming 9 relaxation of the traveling salesman problem to the setting of the k-T SP , and from this derive a (2; 3)-T SP -approximator. For each edge e, we define a variable x e 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and for each vertex v i we define a variable y i 2 [0; 1]. Intuitively, x e = 1 indicates that edge e will be used by the tour, and y i = 1 indicates that vertex v i will be visited by the tour. <p> For each edge e, we define a variable x e 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and for each vertex v i we define a variable y i 2 [0; 1]. Intuitively, x e = 1 indicates that edge e will be used by the tour, and y i = 1 indicates that vertex v i will be visited by the tour.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the optimum solutions to the M LP in a number of special cases have structure similar to the on-line search patterns constructed by Baeza-Yates, Culberson, and Rawlins <ref> [3] </ref>. Another source of interest in this problem comes from the traveling salesman problem itself. <p> What is the range of (ff; fi) for which a polynomial-time (ff; fi)-T SP -approximator exists? The notion of concatenating tours in lengths that increase geometrically is a method that is well-known in a number of settings | for example, in the design of on-line algorithms (see e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>). It would be interesting to consider other applications of the idea of choosing a random initial starting point for the geometric sequence. Finally, there remain a number of natural variants of the traveling salesman problem for which it is unknown whether there exists a constant-factor approximation algorithm.

Reference-contexts: However, we don't know how to exploit this fact. We can give an even better T SP -approximator by using linear programming techniques in the spirit of Bienstock et al. <ref> [4] </ref> for the prize-collecting TSP.
