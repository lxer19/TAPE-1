Abstract: Markov Random Fields (MRF's) can be used for a wide variety of vision problems. In this paper we focus on MRF's with two-valued clique potentials, which form a generalized Potts model. We show that the maximum a posteriori estimate of such an MRF can be obtained by solving a multiway minimum cut problem on a graph. We develop efficient algorithms for computing good approximations to the minimum mul-tiway cut. The visual correspondence problem can be formulated as an MRF in our framework; this yields quite promising results on real data with ground truth. We also apply our techniques to MRF's with linear clique potentials.

Reference-contexts: for the n links in the cut is equal to X w fp;qg (1 ffi (f C q )): The theorem now follows from (5) and (6). 3.3 Multiway cut minimization While the general multiway minimum cut problem is NP-complete, there are provably good approximations with near linear running time <ref> [3] </ref>, and this is an area of active research. Approximating cuts, however, should be used carefully. <p> If C approximates the minimum multiway cut on G within some known bounds, the value of E (f C ) might not be within the same bounds with respect to the exact minimum of the posterior energy in (3). For example, cuts produced by the algorithm in <ref> [3] </ref> are not guaranteed to be even feasible. Here we describe a method that greedily reduces the cost of multiway cuts on G. Our algorithm gener ates a cut C such that f C is a local minimum of the posterior energy function (3) in a certain strong sense.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Many early vision problems require estimating some spatially varying quantity (such as intensity, texture or disparity) from noisy measurements. These problems can be naturally formulated in a Bayesian framework using Markov Random Fields <ref> [6] </ref>. In this framework, the task is to find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the underlying quantity. <p> describe some related work where graph cuts are applied to vision problems, and we show that our techniques can be used to efficiently compute the MAP estimate of an MRF with linear clique potentials. 2 Markov Random Fields Markov Random Fields were first introduced into vision by Geman and Geman <ref> [6] </ref>. The MRF framework can express a wide variety of spatially varying priors. <p> Note that the clique potential of such an MRF resembles a robust estimator, in that it has a fixed maximum value (in the language of robust statistics, it is re-descending). Most vision applications of MRF's follow <ref> [6] </ref> by introducing a line process that explicitly models discontinuities. [1] showed that if spatial restrictions on discontinuities are ignored, the line process can be eliminated by using a robust penalty function.

Reference-contexts: If there are only two possible labels, the multiway cut problem simplifies to the traditional max flow-min cut. This allows the MAP estimate to be computed very efficiently, as was shown by Greig, Porteus and Seheult in <ref> [7] </ref>. Our solution can be viewed as a generalization of their result beyond binary images. Other generalizations with quite different properties have been recently proposed by Ferrari et al. [4, 5].

Reference-contexts: Our choice of edge weights guarantees the optimality property of Theorem 2. In contrast, the weights in [12] lack theoretical justification. As a result, their algorithm does not appear to have any optimality properties. Note that Ishikawa and Geiger <ref> [8] </ref> describe an image segmentation technique that finds the global minimum of an energy function closely related to ~ E (f ). Their solution, developed independently before ours, finds a minimum cut on a graph similar to ~ G except for some details.

Reference-contexts: For example, two neighboring pixels p and q in P are much more likely to have the same disparity if we know that i p i q . Most methods for computing correspondence do not make use of this kind of contextual information. An exception is <ref> [10] </ref>, which describes a method also based on MRF's. In their approach, intensity edges were used to bias the line process. They allow discontinuities to form without penalty on intensity edges. While our MRF's do not use a line process, we can easily incorporate contextual information into our framework.

Reference-contexts: The likelihood models the sensor noise, and the prior describes preferences among different hypotheses. In this paper, we focus on MAP estimation of a class of Markov Random Fields which generalizes the Potts model <ref> [11] </ref>. These MRF's have Gibbs clique potentials with a particular form that resembles a well. We begin by describing the generalized Potts model, and giving an energy function that has a global minimum at the MAP estimate. <p> If u fp;qg is a constant, then this yields the Potts model <ref> [11] </ref>. Note that fp; qg is a set, not a tuple, so V (p;q) (f p ; f q ) = V (q;p) (f q ; f p ). These MRF's are thus isotropic (i.e., independent of orientation).
