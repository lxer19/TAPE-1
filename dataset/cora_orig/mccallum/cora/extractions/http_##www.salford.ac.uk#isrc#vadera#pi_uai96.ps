Abstract: The validation of data from sensors has become an important issue in the operation and control of modern industrial plants. One approach is to use knowledge based techniques to detect inconsistencies in measured data. This article presents a probabilistic model for the detection of such inconsistencies. Based on probability propagation, this method is able to find the existence of a possible fault among the set of sensors. That is, if an error exists, many sensors present an apparent fault due to the propagation from the sensor(s) with a real fault. So the fault detection mechanism can only tell if a sensor has a potential fault, but it can not tell if the fault is real or apparent. So the central problem is to develop a theory, and then an algorithm, for distinguishing real and apparent faults, given that one or more sensors can fail at the same time. This article then, presents an approach based on two levels: (i) probabilistic reasoning, to detect a potential fault, and (ii) constraint management, to distinguish the real fault from the apparent ones. The proposed approach is exemplified by applying it to a power plant model.

Reference-contexts: A survey of some of these techniques can be found in [ Basseville, 1988 ] . Previous stages in the development of this project included some experiments in the validation of signals in power plants <ref> [ Ibarguengoytia et al., 1995 ] </ref> . These experiments were based on the following assumption: each sensor is validated independently, i.e., each variable was considered as the hypothesis while some other variables were considered as correct evidence. <p> Finally, the last step in the project will be the construction of a prototype which performs in a thermo-electrical power plant. This prototype requires a real time response. For this reason, different mechanisms of scheduling have to be developed, e.g., any time algorithms <ref> [ Ibarguengoytia et al., 1995 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: Examples of these techniques are generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) [ Willsky and Jones, 1976 ] , and failure sensitive filters <ref> [ Massoumnia, 1986 ] </ref> . However, these approaches can require the development of mathematical or knowledge based models whose solution require expensive computer power.

Reference-contexts: This follows from the axioms of conditional independence and the Soundness theorem <ref> [ Pearl et al., 1990 ] </ref> . Although there may be other Markov blankets, only this type of blankets are considered. In using a Bayesian network representation for sensor validation, the following assumptions are made: 1. Observability: all the variables (sensors) can be measured directly 2 . 2. <p> In any case, X 2 M B (Y ). Next, the proof that if Y =2 M B (X) then X =2 M B (Y ). By Definition 2, I (X; M B (X); G M B (X) X), and by the Symmetry and Decomposition axioms <ref> [ Pearl et al., 1990 ] </ref> I (Y i ; M B (X); X), 8Y i 2 G M B (X) X.

Reference-contexts: Both layers make use of a probabilistic network model. A probabilistic or Bayesian network <ref> [ Pearl, 1988 ] </ref> is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose structure corresponds to the dependency relations of the set of variables represented in the network (nodes), and which is parameterized by the conditional probabilities (links) required to specify the underlying distribution. <p> Section 4 explains and demonstrates these mechanisms. 4 A THEORY FOR SENSOR VALIDATION The probabilistic model for sensor validation consists of a Bayesian network as defined by Pearl <ref> [ Pearl, 1988 ] </ref> . That is, a directed acyclic graph G which is a minimal I-map of the dependency model M for a probability distribution P . <p> G is an I-map of M if every conditional independence condition (according to the D-separation criteria) displayed in G corresponds to a valid conditional independence relationship in M . It is a minimal I-map if none of its links can be deleted without destroying its I-mapness <ref> [ Pearl, 1988 ] </ref> . Definition 1: Given a probability distribution P on a set of variables V , a DAG G = (V; E) (V is a set of nodes, E is a set of links) is a Bayesian Network iff G is a minimal I-map of P .

Reference-contexts: This is possible in applications such as civilian aircraft or part of the nuclear industry <ref> [ Yung and Clarke, 1989 ] </ref> . However, for many industrial plants, these techniques are not feasible where, for example, adding further sensors might weaken the walls of the pres sure vessels. * Analytical redundancy: in which all process, actuators and sensors are monitored centrally. <p> Additionally, they are very expensive and demand an enormous amount of expertise to use them in a different process or even make a modification of the monitored system. Modern techniques, from where this project is motivated, include a decentralised and hierarchical approach <ref> [ Yung and Clarke, 1989 ] </ref> . A survey of some of these techniques can be found in [ Basseville, 1988 ] .
