Abstract: In this paper we show a geometric approach to specifying and planning the motion of robotic Molecules on a substrate of Molecules in O(n) time, where n is the number of Molecules in the substrate. We present a language for specifying the Molecule motion. We show descriptions of algorithms for performing global translations, rotations, and stacking of molecular structures. We show that these motions are sufficient to guarantee that molecular structures can move along certain classes of trajectories. We also examine a geometric approach to computing the motion of individual Molecules on a substrate of Molecules by constructing a reachability graph and searching this graph for a path. Finally, we show how to use the graph to synthesize a motion plan in the Molecule motion specification language.

Reference-contexts: This work also examines theoretical lower-bounds for planning the self-reconfiguring motion of such modules. The proposed self-reconfigurable robots differ from metamorphic robots in their design, their capability of recon-figuring in three dimensions, and the dynamic nature of the aggregated structures.

Reference-contexts: We have designed a small and simple robotic module we call a Molecule capable of self-reconfiguration in three dimensions. The design of this module and the individual Molecule control are described in detail in <ref> [KRVM] </ref>. The Molecule (see Figure 1) is capable of independent movement on a substrate of identical Molecules, including straight-line traversal and 90 degree convex and concave transitions to adjacent surfaces. <p> On the analytical side, [CB97] describe a method to enumerate the number of non-isomorphic assembly configurations of a modular robot system. In our previous work <ref> [KRVM] </ref> we describe an artificial Molecule that can aggregate with other identical Molecules as arbitrary three-dimensional structures. 2 The Self-reconfigurable Molecule 2.1 Architecture The design of Molecule robots [KRVM] consists of two atoms linked by a rigid connection called a bond (see Figure 1). <p> In our previous work <ref> [KRVM] </ref> we describe an artificial Molecule that can aggregate with other identical Molecules as arbitrary three-dimensional structures. 2 The Self-reconfigurable Molecule 2.1 Architecture The design of Molecule robots [KRVM] consists of two atoms linked by a rigid connection called a bond (see Figure 1). Each atom has five inter-Molecule connection points and two degrees of freedom. <p> The details of controlling these motions using the 4 molecular DOFs are provided in <ref> [KRVM] </ref>. We summarize the linear walk algorithm. The other algorithms are similar. Linear walking. Although each Molecule has only rotational degrees of freedom, they can effect linear motion. We propose the following three stage algorithm. Figure 2 shows the three stages in a linear walk. <p> For this pair to stack itself on top of the 2k 1 pair, each Molecule must make a concave transition to the side of the tower, translate to the top of the side, and then make a convex transition to the upper surface. <ref> [KRVM] </ref> demonstrated the ability of Molecules to perform concave and convex transitions. The side of the tower a 3-atom-wide planar surface with atoms fully packing two adjacent vertical columns. This guarantees that there is an unbroken sequence of diagonal atoms over the full height of the tower.
