Reference-contexts: The Transportation Company handles most tasks related to transport in an international environment including production of customs documents, shipping forms, etc. As these responsibilities begin to show, a number of elements can be identified in the supply chain. These objects can be modelled in a simple UML <ref> [Booch et. al., 98] </ref> object model to highlight a taxonomy of entities and relations between them. A high-level model showing some of the supply chain scenario objects is depicted in figure 1.

Reference-contexts: These required elements can be viewed as domain-specific objects which require PIF core extensions, which are called Partially Shared Views (PSVs) [Malone & Lee, 90], in order to express the processes found in this scenario. The conceptualization process <ref> [Fernndez et. al., 97; Gmez-Prez et. al., 1996] </ref> performed during the development of the domain-specific ontological extension for this scenario was guided by a verb-noun phrase extraction technique. This is similiar to other approaches for identification and classification using grammars [cf. Kingston et. al., 97; Valente et. al., 96].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction There have been a number of initiatives to standardise shared languages and ontologies within the general subject area of activities and processes. These include enterprise processes (Process Interchange Format (PIF) [Lee et. al., 96]; Enterprise Ontology <ref> [Fraser & Tate, 95; Uschold et. al., 98] </ref>; Toronto Virtual Enterprise (TOVE) ontology [Fox et. al., 93]); workflow processes (International Workflow Management Coalition's Workflow Process Definition Language (WPDL) [WfMC, 94]); manufacturing processes (NIST's Process Specification Language [Schlenoff et. al., 96]); and planning (Shared Planning and Activity Representation (SPAR) ).

Reference-contexts: This has become an important issue for many organisations as they rethink the way they do business. For example, Hammer and Champy pointed out a need for radically changing the processes of a manufacturing logistics supply chain in their pioneering book on Business Process Reengineering <ref> [Hammer & Champy, 94] </ref>. The overall objective of the supply chain for the scenario referred to in this document is: to obtain benefits by rapidly getting manufactured commercial electronic products from the production line into retail stores.

Reference-contexts: Time durations are included in an extension of the PIF core. This work builds upon <ref> [Hayes, 96] </ref>. These informal notions are made precise in PIF by defining the notion of a formal model structure for the PIF core. Details are omitted here. The basic notions of the PIF core are axiomatized formally as a first-order theory.

Reference-contexts: We can also point out that a document has a relationship to some set of "information resources". In CYC terms <ref> [Lenat & Guha, 90] </ref>, we would say the "sales order document" is an "#$StructuredInformationSource" whereas its associated informational resources are "#$InformationBearingThings".

Reference-contexts: The business consulting team would like to utilise MIT's library of business processes found in the Process Handbook (PH) <ref> [Malone et. al., 93] </ref> as a basis for process specification. The PH may be used to analyse tradeoffs and alternatives for the supply chain processes. The team would then like to transfer the process descriptions to KBSI's ProSim .

Reference-contexts: As an example of such an exchange, a demonstration scenario <ref> [Polyak, 98] </ref> has been created which describes the use of PIF in the modelling and simulation of an integrated supply chain [cf. Gattorna & Walters, 96; Arntzen et. al., 95; Lee & Billington, 93] where different companies co-operate through a global supply chain management procedure to deliver commercial electronic goods. <p> This diagram has a ``swim lane'' layout which identifies the temporal ordering of the processes across all of the companies. Each process identified in this diagram is associated with a particular supplier and is broken down in the source scenario document <ref> [Polyak, 98] </ref>. Two of these detailed processes are presented in sections 4.1 and 4.2. The flow of supply chain activities stem from a ``replenish inventory'' process which is initiated at the retailer. This leads to a cross-organisational activation of a process at the distributor.
