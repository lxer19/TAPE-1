Abstract: We describe the design, implementation, and deployment via the Internet of BioSCAN, an application-specific computer system for the rapid determination of statistically significant alignments of biopolymer (DNA, RNA, protein) sequences. BioSCAN continues to outperform other systems designed to perform this basic task of molecular biology, which continues to grow in magnitude and importance. The BioSCAN system is hosted by a general-purpose workstation containing a special-purpose hardware engine that accelerates the core algorithm for comparing two biosequences. Careful partitioning of the computational tasks between hardware and software provides not only high performance but also programmability. The BioSCAN system can compare a sequence of up to 12,992 characters with an arbitrarily large database containing arbitrarily long sequences at a rate of 2 million database characters per second. This rate is nearly 1,000 times greater than the rate achieved by a state-of-the-art workstation using software alone. This network-sharable computational resource is accessible interactively via the World Wide Web using

Reference-contexts: The system flags locations in an entry sequence that are sufficiently similar to the query sequence to satisfy a programmable goodness-of-fit measure specified by a substitution score table <ref> (Altschul, 1991) </ref>. The resulting information may be used in various ways depending on the desired application. Generally the hardware helps to reduce the amount of data to be subsequently processed by the software by several orders of magnitude.

Reference-contexts: Computational tools have been implemented to address this problem using a general-purpose uniprocessor, general-purpose multiprocessor, or special-purpose multiprocessor system. Two popular heuristic-based search tools that run on a general-purpose uniprocessor are FASTA (Pearson and Lipman, 1988) and BLAST <ref> (Altschul et al., 1990) </ref>. Parallel processing programs developed to run on a general-purpose multiprocessor system include dFLASH (Rigoutsos and Califano, 1993) on the IBM SP/1 and Blaze (Brutlag et al., 1993) on the MasPar MP-1. <p> One of the earliest exhaustive sequence comparison methods is that of Needleman and Wunsch (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970). Subsequently, many algorithmic refinements have been offered, most notably by Smith and Waterman (Smith and Waterman, 1981) and by Altschul and other <ref> (Altschul et al., 1990) </ref>. Generally, given two sequences of lengths m and n, each of O (m 2 ) contiguous segments of one sequence (of all possible lengths, starting at each position) are compared with all O (n 2 ) segments of the same length of the other sequence. <p> The BioSCAN system directly implements a simple linear similarity algorithm. This generates alignments without insertion and deletion, very similar to the BLAST system <ref> (Altschul et al., 1990) </ref>. The score of each segment pair is the sum of the scores of the aligned characters. A two-dimensional lookup table provides the score for each pair of aligned characters. Several high-scoring segment pairs may be combined to estimate the overall similarity of the two sequences.
