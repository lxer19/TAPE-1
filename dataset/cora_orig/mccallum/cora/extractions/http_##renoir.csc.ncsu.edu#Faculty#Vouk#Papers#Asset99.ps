Title: ASSET99 Potok and Vouk A Model of Correlated Team Behavior in a Software Development Environment

Abstract: In todays highly competitive software development environments, accurately estimating software duration and cost can often mean the difference between project success or failure. Traditional software development estimation techniques often assume that software development teams operate independently from task to task. This assumption allows task estimate covariances to be ignored. However, there is ample evidence that the behavior of a software development team is not independent, but is consistent over the life of a project. This means that the accuracy of software estimates may suffer due to this simplifying assumption. We present results from what we believe is the first general model for representing correlated team behavior in a software development environment. This model shows that strong teams that behave in a correlated manor out perform teams that operate randomly. What is not as obvious is that weak teams that consistently perform poorly have a lower overall productivity than a random team. This suggests that the best cure for a poorly performing team may be to randomly shuffle the team members.

Reference-contexts: If this assumption holds, then estimating the mean and variance of the joint PDF can be a fairly trivial task. The PERT model is probably the best-known activity based model used for software development [MacCrimmon et al. <ref> (1964) </ref>]. Other representative activity model include: Markov chains [Raffo (1993)]; and PETAN networks combining general activity networks and Petri nets [Elmaghraby et al. (1995)].
