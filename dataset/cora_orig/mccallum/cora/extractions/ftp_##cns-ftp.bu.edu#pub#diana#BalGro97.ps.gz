Reference-contexts: The long-range mechanisms interact, in turn, with a long-range attentive grouping process. Together these processes have been used to simulate parametric data about how the brain overcomes aperture ambiguities to generate a coherent representation of a moving object's direction and speed <ref> (Chey et al, 1994, 1997) </ref>. The basic idea of how discrete events in time generate a continuous long-range motion wave is very simple. Suppose that the neural activity due to one event decays while the activity due to a later, spatially displaced, event grows (Figure 2a).

Reference-contexts: peak activity moves continuously from one input position to the other if (a) the first Gaussian decays as the second Gaussian grows, (b) the first Gaussian decays faster than the second one, or (c) the first Gaussian grows faster than the second one. object's global direction and speed of motion <ref> (Chey et al., 1997) </ref>. In this conception, output cells from the long-range motion filter go through another directionally-selective filter whose cells compete to choose a winning direction. The winning cells send top-down signals back to the long-range filter cells; see Figure 1. <p> This interpretation leads to the prediction that MST cells make a directional choice that is used to overcome aperture ambiguities in MT cell responses. Top-down signals from MST cells are proposed to select MT cells that encode an object's direction of motion and to suppress those that do not <ref> (Chey et al., 1997) </ref>. Our exposition begins with a brief summary of models of boundary completion and color filling 5 in to highlight properties that are important for explaining formotion percepts. Then relevant modeling properties of short-range and long-range motion processing are summarized. <p> These signals have elsewhere been 16 highlight some important features of boundary formation (short-range competition) and form-motion interaction (G-wave between signals that increase or decrease simultaneously). See text for details. used to explain the motion capture that overcomes aperture ambiguities <ref> (Chey et al, 1997) </ref>. They can also focus attention upon a primed direction of motion. Thus, in the absence of other stronger bottom-up factors, top-down attentional priming may have a rate-limiting effect upon the direction of perceived motion.

Reference-contexts: shown in Figure 15e. 11 Simulation of split motion The split motion experiment illustrated in Figure 8b is simulated to demonstrate how boundary, surface, and motion waves formed from both sides collide, and how the collision point moves closer to the box that appears earlier as the SOA is increased <ref> (Faubert and von Grunau, 1995) </ref>. Figure 16a shows the simulation layout and node assignment for the split motion experiment. Nodes 1-5 are assigned to the top horizontal edge of the box on the left, which is active all the time.

Reference-contexts: The later boundary persists longer due to cooperative support by vertical bipole cells that receive inputs from the vertical edges of the prime <ref> (Francis et al, 1994) </ref>. Appendix D contains the proof that a G-wave can also occur from a fast decaying signal to slow decaying signal. Thus the test bar appears to grow out of the collinear priming bar towards the noncollinear priming bar.

Reference-contexts: As schematized in Figure 1, the model proposes that the long-range apparent motion mechanism that generates G-waves can also engage spatial attention. G-waves help spatial attention to track even intermittently viewed targets by smoothly interpolating their intermittently viewed positions <ref> (Grossberg, 1991, 1997b) </ref>. G-waves can smoothly interpolate intermittent target views even if they represent targets moving with variable speed (Grossberg and Rudd, 1989, 1992).

Reference-contexts: As a result, orientational competition from this boundary can slow down the growth of the horizontal boundary from the second box, along with its transients. In addition, in the full 3-D version of FACADE theory <ref> (Grossberg, 1994, 1997a) </ref>, it is shown that filled-in surface representations send feedback to the boundaries that support them, thereby confirming and strengthening these boundaries while inhibiting boundaries corresponding to larger distances from the observer.

The 3-D examples in Figure 10 can be explained by FACADE theory using these 3-D mechanisms in combination with the form-motion interstream interaction. One fact that complicates understanding of formotion percepts is that not all of the above factors contribute equally, or at all, in every experiment.

Reference-contexts: We also explain how various combinations of activity onsets and offsets, or relative onset rates or offset rates, can lead to such a G-wave (Figure 2). The proposal that onset and offset combinations can lead to a G-wave was first used to simulate data about long-range apparent motion <ref> (Grossberg and Rudd, 1989, 1992) </ref>. G-waves occur in the motion stream at the long-range motion filter, whose functional role is to combine motion estimates from multiple orientations, contrast polarities, and both eyes into a pooled estimate of motion direction. <p> G-waves help spatial attention to track even intermittently viewed targets by smoothly interpolating their intermittently viewed positions (Grossberg, 1991, 1997b). G-waves can smoothly interpolate intermittent target views even if they represent targets moving with variable speed <ref> (Grossberg and Rudd, 1989, 1992) </ref>. <p> Since a number of results where a G-wave occurs from decaying signals to growing signals have been described elsewhere <ref> (Grossberg and Rudd, 1989, 1992) </ref>, we describe here one example for the case when a G-wave is formed from fast decaying boundary signals to slow decaying boundary signals (Figure 9a). The simulation layout and node assignment are given in Figure 15a.

Reference-contexts: Francis and Grossberg (1996a) have computationally modeled this form-motion interaction and used it to simulate data that link the persistence of boundary segmentations in the form stream to the quality of apparent motion in the motion stream, including Korte's Laws <ref> (Korte, 1915) </ref>. Herein we extend this approach to show how many formotion percepts emerge from preattentive waves of boundary growth and color filling-in within the form stream, waves of long-range apparent motion within the motion stream, and interactions between these changing form and motion signals via the form-motion linkage. <p> These various effects are simulated below. They particularly support the model's claim that transients of the boundary signals activate the motion system. This property was used in Francis and Grossberg (1996a) to simulate Korte's laws <ref> (Korte, 1915) </ref>. The model hereby suggests an unsuspected mechanistic link between Korte's laws and the Faubert-von Grunau split motion data.

Reference-contexts: G-wave properties are consistent with data showing that spatial attention can travel across variable distances in equal time (Kwak, Dagenbach, and Egeth, 1991; Remington and Pierce, 1984), is controlled by the magnocellular processing stream (Steinman at al, 1996), and has a center-surround organization <ref> (Steinman et al, 1995) </ref>. The model also proposes how, once attention is engaged, top-down attentional priming can influence the direction of perceived motion (Groner, Hofer, and Groner, 1986; Sekuler and Ball, 1977; Stelmach, Herdman, and McNeil, 1994).

Reference-contexts: The directional choice in the feedback circuit is proposed to occur in the ventral part of cortical area MST, which has large directionally tuned receptive fields that are specialized for detecting moving objects <ref> (Tanaka et al., 1993) </ref>. In this interpretation, MST can attentionally modulate MT cells, which are proposed to include the long-range filter cells. Consistent with this proposal, Treue and Maunsell (1996) have shown that attention can modulate motion processing in cortical areas MT and MST in behaving macaque monkeys.

Reference-contexts: They can also focus attention upon a primed direction of motion. Thus, in the absence of other stronger bottom-up factors, top-down attentional priming may have a rate-limiting effect upon the direction of perceived motion. We now consider some of the formotion experiments in which more complex figures change shape <ref> (Tse et al, 1996) </ref>. These experiments highlight some important features of boundary formation (short-range competition) and form-motion interaction (G-wave between signals that increase or decrease simultaneously) that were not responsible for motion perception in the experiments described in Figure 8. Figure 9 sketches four such experiments.
