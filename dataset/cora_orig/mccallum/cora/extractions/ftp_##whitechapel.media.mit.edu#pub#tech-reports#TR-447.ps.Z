Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 447 Submitted to ICASSP 98 Abstract In this work, inspired by the application of human-machine interaction and the potential use that human-computer interfaces can make of knowledge regarding the affective state of a user, we investigate the problem of sensing and recognizing typical affective experiences that arise when people communicate with computers. In particular, we address the problem of detecting "frustration" in human computer interfaces. By first sensing human biophysiological correlates of internal affective states, we proceed to stochastically model the biological time series with Hidden Markov Models to obtain user-dependent recognition systems that learn affective patterns from a set of training data. Labeling criteria to classify the data are discussed, and generalization of the results to a set of unobserved data is evaluated. Significant recognition results (greater than random) are reported for 21 of 24 subjects.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction 1.1 Motivation Affective Computing is a newly emerging field which has been defined as "computing that relates to, arises from, or deliberately influences emotions" <ref> [1] </ref>. There exists a variety of challenging open research problems in this area, especially concerning the issue of emotion detection and classification.

Reference-contexts: The aim of the work presented here is to develop systems that learn typical responses of a user during what psychologists call "a high arousal situation," in particular the kind of frustration that arises while interacting with a computer <ref> [2] </ref>. The emphasis of this work is on affect detection and classification; it should be noted, however, that this work is motivated by and has implications for other functionalities of a complete affective system.

Reference-contexts: Also, in order to avoid numerical errors (especially when estimating covariance matrices of very small values), the extracted features were scaled to exhibit a higher range of amplitudes. For these simulations we used the following scale factors: <ref> [4; 10; 0:5; 500; 0:02] </ref> T . The values were chosen to keep the data within the range 2. 3 Results Recognition rates were evaluated by determining the percentage of instances of F and F classes that were classified correctly within the time boundaries determined by the ground truth.

Reference-contexts: Estimating the parameters of an HMM from the training data has been discussed at length in the literature. We have used the standard Baum-Welch re-estimation algorithm to obtain initial parameters of the model [3],[4], and then improved initial estimates with the embedded Baum-Welch algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. Once the systems have been trained, the performance is assessed by applying a Viterbi decoder to a set of testing data and producing a set of transcription labels [6]. <p> Efficient software implementation of these learning algorithms was done using the Hidden Markov Toolkit (HTK) (version 2.0) (developed at Cambridge University and Entropic Research Laboratories) <ref> [5] </ref>. How to choose a model structure (i.e. number of states, output distribution types, and model topology) is not clear for the signals we have chosen to measure.

Reference-contexts: Another time-frequency approach to have received much attention lately, in particular in the study of non-stationary biosignals for feature extraction, is wavelet analysis <ref> [7] </ref>. Let us assume that an orthogonal wavelet decomposition of the BVP signal is implemented with J levels of resolution (i.e., via a filter bank decomposition), and let f ^ d jk g be the wavelet coefficients quantifying the level of "detail" at level j.
