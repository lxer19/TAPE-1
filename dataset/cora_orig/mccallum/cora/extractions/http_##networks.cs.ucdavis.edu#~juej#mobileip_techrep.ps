Reference-contexts: In Section 6, we discuss some important issues in implementing mobile-IP over ATM. Finally, in Section 7, we conclude this paper and discuss some key future research directions. 2. Mobile-IP Protocol The basic mobile-IP protocol <ref> [1] </ref> has evolved out of the efforts of the mobile-IP working group. The basic mobile-IP protocol defines the following entities: 1. Mobile Host: an IP host that, by virtue of its mobility, changes its point of attachment to the network. <p> It also de-registers with the home agent, which in turn sends a gratuitous ARP to update cache entries in the hosts and routers. 2.2 Routing in Mobile-IP In the basic mobile-IP document <ref> [1] </ref>, IP packets destined for a mobile host which is outside of the home network are routed through the mobile hosts home agent. To achieve this, the home agent acts as a proxy for the mobile host while the mobile host is in a foreign network. <p> When the mobile host sends a registration request, it will randomly choose one of the home agents to service the request. As defined in the mobile-IP protocol <ref> [1] </ref>, we assume the each mobile registration request has an unique identification and a lifetime which defines the time for which the registration is valid. The latter will be referred to as the T reg .

Reference-contexts: One way to improve the mobile IP protocol is route optimization <ref> [2] </ref> in which the messages are routed directly to the care-of address instead of first sending the message to the home agent. This is accomplished by having the correspondent host maintain a binding cache which contains the care-of addresses for the mobile hosts to which it is sending messages. <p> This is accomplished by having the correspondent host maintain a binding cache which contains the care-of addresses for the mobile hosts to which it is sending messages. Details of the current version of the route optimization technique can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. One disadvantage of route optimization is that it requires the source host to be aware of the mobile hosts mobility, wheras in the original mobile-IP, the mobilty of a destination host is transparent to the souce host.

Reference-contexts: When the foreign agent receives the packet, it updates it own table and relays the reply to the mobile host. In the home network, the home agent uses a gratuitous ARP <ref> [3] </ref> to update the ARP Mobile-IP Protocol With Multiple Home Agents Performance Analysis of a Replicated Server Architecture for Mobile-IP 4 cache of all hosts and routers that currently have a cache entry for the mobile host. <p> To achieve this, the home agent acts as a proxy for the mobile host while the mobile host is in a foreign network. The home agent responds to ARP queries for the mobile host with a proxy ARP reply <ref> [3] </ref>. This results in the mobile hosts IP address being bound to the link layer address of the home agent. When the home agent receives an IP packet destined to the mobile host, it uses the mobility binding to encapsulate (or tunnel) the IP packet within another IP packet.

Reference-contexts: This is achieved either through host solicitation or through agent advertisement <ref> [4] </ref>. If the network is deemed to be a foreign network, the mobile host registers by sending a registration request to the foreign agent. In the request, the mobile host provides its permanent IP address and the IP address of the home agent.

Reference-contexts: In this analysis, we assume that the two arrival processes are independent. Furthermore, instead of solving a two priority queueing model, we will use the shadow server approximation proposed in <ref> [9] </ref> to analyze two priority queues. In this approximation, we will aggregate the high priority traffic by appropriately modifying the service time of the Class 2 requests.
