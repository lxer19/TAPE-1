Reference-contexts: This textual statement comments on what has gone before, and alludes to what may lie ahead. Words in this text, if selected, may trigger other related scenes. Several lines of interpretative text overlapping with the video sequences creates aesthetic and narrative simultanieties <ref> [10] </ref> in the overall videotext. The presence of the verbal text in the realm of the primarily visual video clips also creates a tension between word and image that further illustrates thematic elements present in HyperCafe.

Reference-contexts: We describe the hypermedia authoring process along with the Hypevideo Engine, a prototype hypermedia playback system that we have developed. Finally, we discuss future work in hypervideo, including collaborative hypervideo on the WWW and a proposed visual authoring tool. HYPERMEDIA: A SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL APPROACH HyperCafe <ref> [11] </ref> is an experimental hypermedia project developed by the authors to illustrate general hypervideo concepts. <p> Our focus is on the viewer experience generated by navigating and interacting with the video and text-based opportunities that unfold in the course of the narrative. Such opportunities are intentionally structured and presented within a temporal continuity based on aspects of film aesthetic and hypertext fiction (further discussed in <ref> [11] </ref>). In developing a structural framework for hypervideo, we have considered the design aspects and interaction modalities for presenting such experiences to viewers. FRAMEWORK FOR HYPERVIDEO Hypervideo necessitates a restructuring and rethinking of ideas about authoring and navigating links.

Reference-contexts: Such techniques would minimize (if not eliminate) explicit coding of spatio-temporal links by the user. For a good discussion of approaches to parsing and abstraction of visual features in video content, see recent work by Zhang, et al. <ref> [12] </ref> Interactive Authoring Tools The hypervideo scripting techniques we provide, allow a high-level control of the Engine, yet this approach can be further simplified by a visual authoring tool.
