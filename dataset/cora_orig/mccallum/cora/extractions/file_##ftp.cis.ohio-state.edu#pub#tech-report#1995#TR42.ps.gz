Abstract: Mobile computers use wireless channels to communicate with other computers. Efficient channel allocation is at the heart of an efficient mobile computing system. The finite number of channels should be efficiently allocated to maximize throughput and to avoid co-channel interference. Temporal variations in channel demand (load) require channel allocation to adapt dynamically to the changing demand. The presence of load imbalance does not automatically imply the usefulness of channel transfer. In this paper we present a probabilistic analysis of the temporal imbalance in channel demand. The effectiveness of channel transfer depends on the duration for which the imbalance persists. This duration is influenced in part by the velocity of mobile units. The wide variance in velocities of the mobile units can be handled by using a hierarchical cellular layout. Bulk channel transfers can be employed to reduce the overheads of channel transfer and to enable the system to quickly adjust to spatial variations in channel demand. The results of our analysis provide guidelines for the design of dynamic distributed channel allocation strategies.

Reference-contexts: It will get more difficult in the future because the number of mobile units is increasing rapidly. Hence, the second option of cell planning looks more promising. Umbrella cells overlaying smaller microcells in urban areas <ref> [2] </ref> are one solution. Faster moving units can be connected to the umbrella cells and slower moving 20 units can be connected to the smaller microcells. Sung and Wong [25] extend the solution by proposing a hierarchical organization of cells and M SSs.

Reference-contexts: A mobile host can have wireless communication with any other node in the network, fixed or mobile, only through the M SS of the cell in which it is present <ref> [3] </ref>. If a particular wireless channel is used concurrently by more than one communication session in the same cell, or in neighboring cells, the signals of the communicating units will interfere with each other. Such an interference is called co-channel interference.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 shows a 7-cell cluster system where channels can be reused at a distance of 3 cells. We assume that all the channels in the Spectrum can be completely ordered based on their frequency band. As described in <ref> [11, 28] </ref>, we assume that in order to support new communication sessions in a cell, channel assignment is done in ascending order from among the set of free nominal channels allocated to the cell, and channel borrowing is done in descending order of free nominal channels of the neighbors. <p> The M SS will start its effort to borrow channels as soon as the highly loaded state is reached. Due to ordered allocation of channels <ref> [11] </ref> the free channel sets in the cell lending a channel and in its co-channel cells closest to the borrower are related by the relation. Hence, the interference constraints of the co-channel cells during borrowing (item 2 above) can be ignored.

Reference-contexts: Before we proceed with a probabilistic analysis of the potential for channel transfer, a few important terms need to be defined. First passage time has been defined in <ref> [14] </ref> as follows: Definition 1 (First Passage Time): Let fX (t); t 0g be a stationary stochastic process with state space consisting of the non-negative integers. Let m and n be two distinct non-negative integers. <p> Let F (t; p; q) = P (T (p; q) t). Then, from <ref> [14] </ref>, the following expression is obtained: F (t; p; q) = p 0 + p 0 16 where p is the arrival rate of channel allocation requests and p is the rate at which com-munication sessions are completed in a cell in state p. <p> Then, taking the LST on both sides of the equation for F (t; p; q), using the convolution property <ref> [14] </ref>, ~ F p;q (s) can be written as: ~ F p;q (s) = s + p + p ~ F p+1;q (s) + n ~ F p1;q (s) Similarly, the LST ~ G p;q (s) of G (t; p; q) (the probability distribution of the first passage time of upward <p> Hence: ~ F x;0 (s) = ( ~ F 1;0 (s)) x As the birth rates and death rates remain constant during the downward transitions from the heavily loaded state towards the state of normality, from <ref> [14] </ref>, the following expression of ~ F 1;0 (s) is obtained: ~ F 1;0 (s) = q 2 Using this expression ~ F x;0 can be computed. <p> When a queue is in state p, the probability that time until the next transition is greater than t is equal to e ( p + p )t where p is the birth rate and p is the death rate in state p <ref> [14] </ref>. When one nominal channel out of n is free, p = (n1) and p = . Hence, G (t; 1; 0) = 1P (time until next transition is greater than t) which is equal to 1 e ( p + p )t = 1 e (+(n1))t .

Reference-contexts: Centralized channel allocation schemes have a single point of failure and are not robust <ref> [21] </ref>. Hence, distributed channel allocation schemes are preferred. Such schemes should be able to dynamically adjust to changes in load distribution. Load, in the context of channel allocation, stands for the demand for channels to support communication sessions. <p> If channels are not available to support a communication session, the request is dropped. The centralized algorithms are not robust. The M T SO is a single point of failure. If the M T SO goes down, it can bring down the entire network <ref> [21] </ref>. Also, during periods of high load, the M T SO and the communication subnet in its vicinity may become a bottleneck. Therefore, centralized algorithms are not scalable. Hence, a distributed channel allocation strategy is desirable. In a distributed channel allocation algorithm the M T SO is not needed. <p> However, it will require a departure from the concept of fixed sets of nominal channels assigned to the cell. A channel transfer algorithm that exploits the locality of demand has been presented in <ref> [21] </ref>. 8 Conclusions Distributed dynamic channel allocation is suitable for mobile computing due to its flexibility, robustness, and scalability. Dynamically changing the channels allocated to various cells enables the system to adapt to changes in the temporal and spatial distribution of communication channel demand.

Reference-contexts: Thus using option (b) has the additional cost incurred in communication hand-off. 5. For load balancing in distributed systems, the processing overhead and the communication time needed for job transfer is small as compared to the job processing time <ref> [24] </ref>.
