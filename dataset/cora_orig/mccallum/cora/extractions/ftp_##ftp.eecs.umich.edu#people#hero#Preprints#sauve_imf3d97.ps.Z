Abstract: In this paper we will present numerical studies of the performance of a 3D Compton camera being developed at the University of Michigan. We present a physical model of the camera which exploits symmetries and an adapted spatial sampling pattern in the object domain. This model increases the sparsity of the transition matrix to reduce the very high storage and computation requirements. This model allows the decomposition of the transition matrix into several small blocks that are easy to store. Finally we discuss a real time algorithm which calculates entries of the transition matrix based on a Von Mises model for the conditional scatter angle distribution given the Compton energy measurement as well as a vector reformulation of the computation of the probabilities. Application of the Compton scatter aperture to imaging in nuclear medicine was first proposed in 1974 by Todd and Everett. This camera uses an innovative electronical cone-beam collimator based on the Compton scattering effect. Its requires a 3D image reconstruction. Singh [1] proposed in 1983 a linear image reconstruction for the Compton camera. This reconstruction is computationnally good but uses an inaccurate model of the system since it neglects the Poisson nature of the measurements. Leahy [2] implemented an MLE reconstruction from the transition matrix that takes into account the Poisson noise for a prototype system. This algorithm is computationnally demanding since a 3D image of moderate size (128 3 pixels) requires already a very big matrix T (resp 128 6 ).

Reference-contexts: This means that the sensitivity increases in approximate proportion to the solid angle subtended by det 1 . It has been shown that we can detect 60 times more photons with such a collimator than with a comparable mechanical cone-beam collimator, <ref> [3] </ref>. Moreover, electron-ical collimation provides multiple views simultaneously.
