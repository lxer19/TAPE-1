Reference-contexts: The final phase, geometric wiring, will be the subject of this thesis. 1.1.1 Topological Routing The first two phases of the Surf routing process transform a netlist into a rough form of multi-layer routing called topological routing <ref> [CS84, LM85, DDS91] </ref>. In topological routing, wires are represented as zero-width flexible curves with fixed endpoints. These wires may be continuously moved and stretched as long as they do not cross other wires or objects. <p> Two topological routings are said to be topologically equivalent if one may be transformed to the other by a process of continuous deformation. In order to represent wirings uniquely, Surf uses a canonical form of topological wiring called a rubber-band sketch to represent each layer of the interconnect 2 <ref> [CS84, LM85] </ref>. In rubber-band routing, individual wires are treated as elastic rubber-bands. Rubber-bands naturally contract to the shortest possible length that still maintains the same topology. Figure 1.1 (a) shows a planar wiring pattern and Figure 1.1 (b) shows the topologically equivalent rubber-band form. <p> See Figure 1.1 (c) and Before proceeding further, it is helpful to present some concepts used to determine the routability of a rubber-band sketch. A cut is a line segment between two points in the sketch that intersects with no other points or objects <ref> [CS84] </ref>. The capacity of a cut is the 3 This figure shows various wiring patterns that are topologically equivalent. These patterns correspond to different stages of the transformation from rubber-band sketch to precise geometric wiring. <p> The routability of a sketch can be expressed in terms of the flow and capacity of its cuts: a sketch is routable if and only if no cut has a flow that exceeds its capacity <ref> [CS84] </ref>. Generating an extended rubber-band sketch is sufficient to determine the routability of a sketch. That is, a sketch is routable if and only if it can be transformed into the corresponding extended rubber-band sketch [DKS91, Kon92]. <p> Some of these include: rough routing, homotopic routing, and rubber-band routing. This section describes some of the work done in this area. 8.1.1 Routability Checking Cole and Siegel address the problem of finding a detailed routing given a homotopy (DRH) <ref> [CS84] </ref>. That is, given a placement of modules, terminals along module boundaries, and a rough routing for each net, determine if there is a single layer detailed routing conforming to the homotopy.

Reference-contexts: Since rubber-band routing has, in general, fewer wire segments than geometric wiring, it contains less unnecessary information. The flexible nature of rubber-bands allows designs to be modified incrementally supporting an iterative design process <ref> [DKJS90] </ref>. This flexibility also permits designs using variable-width traces or traces whose width is a function of length|this is especially important for low-power high-speed designs where line resistance can be used to damp reflections in place of terminating resistors [Dai91].

Reference-contexts: the rubber-band representation provides an easier and more intuitive wiring model for manual layout editing than does geometric wiring. 1.1.2 Spoke Creation Once the global and local routing is complete, the topological wiring is transformed to a final geometric wiring in two steps: spoke creation and transformation to geometric wiring <ref> [LM85, DKS91, Kon92] </ref>. The goal of the spoke creation step is to transform the topological wiring represented by the rubber-band sketch into an equivalent topology in which all of the width and spacing constraints are met. Such a sketch is referred to as an extended rubber-band sketch. <p> Generating an extended rubber-band sketch is sufficient to determine the routability of a sketch. That is, a sketch is routable if and only if it can be transformed into the corresponding extended rubber-band sketch <ref> [DKS91, Kon92] </ref>. If the rubber-band sketch represents a routable topology, the result of the spoke creation 5 step will be a fully extended rubber-band sketch. Otherwise, if the sketch is not routable, the spoke creation step will locate all of the endpoints that participate in overflowing cuts. <p> They presented a polynomial time algorithm for testing the routability of a sketch by transforming it to a legal routing. This algorithm provided the starting point for the Surf spokes algorithms presented <ref> [DKS91, Kon92] </ref>. 8.1.2 Compaction Maley presented an algorithm for performing one-dimensional VLSI layout compaction with automatic jog insertion [Mal86]. This algorithm compacts rigid circuit elements (modules) by treating wires as flexible objects which indicate the topology of the layout.

Reference-contexts: It uses a left to right sweep between an upper and lower contour to realize the current trunk using the fewest number of jogs. Hughes studies a number of topological routing problems including unconstrained via minimization, and one-dimensional channel compaction with automatic jog insertion <ref> [Hug92] </ref>. He solves the channel compaction problem in two phases: determining the minimum channel height and then producing a routing that minimizes jogs and wire length.

Kong shows that all wires in an extended rubber-band sketch can be transformed to geometric wiring by replacing them with their S-Route's <ref> [Kon92] </ref>. The S-Route of a rubber-band segment 11 is the transformation that stays "closest" to the original segment without going above it (See Figure 2.4). <p> They presented a polynomial time algorithm for testing the routability of a sketch by transforming it to a legal routing.

Reference-contexts: Results The algorithms described in this thesis were implemented in C and integrated into the Surf layout system <ref> [KR78] </ref>. This section presents some sample results taken from both real and artificial examples. These results are summarized in Table 6.1. The results are divided into three sections: Euclidean, Rectilinear, and Octilinear. The column labeled "Euclidean" gives the total wire length of the input sketch before geometric wiring.

They also proved, independently of Cole and Seigel, a number of theorems relating the routability of a sketch to the flow and capacity of its cuts.

Reference-contexts: By basing compaction constraints on topological routability and careful use of balanced search trees, he is able to improve on previous results. 8.4 Jog Reduction Liao, Sarrafzadeh, and Wong present a solution for the single-layer global routing problem <ref> [LSW91] </ref>. After constructing an initial geometric routing, homotopic post-processing steps are applied to minimize wire length and remove jogs. A topologically equivalent layout with minimum wire length is first constructed by a process of removing empty-U's.

Reference-contexts: to transform each rubber-band segment to a wire that conforms to the required geometry, has the minimum length, and maintains the necessary spacing to other wires in the design. 2.1 Basic Method The wiring transformation described in this paper relies on an algorithmic technique known as the enhanced plane sweep <ref> [SO86] </ref>. The enhanced plane sweep is an extension of the traditional plane sweep. In addition to the normal scan-line used in the plane sweep, the enhanced plane sweep maintains a second scan-line known as the previous boundary. The previous boundary is composed of a set of line segments. <p> This algorithm compacts rigid circuit elements (modules) by treating wires as flexible objects which indicate the topology of the layout.

Reference-contexts: Since it treats other wires as obstacles, the final result may be far from a global (or even local) optimum in terms of jogs. Tuan and Teo present a solution to river routing with minimum number of jogs <ref> [TT91] </ref>. This solution requires that the number of horizontal tracks be known in advance. It uses 60 dynamic programming to compute the minimum jog river routing in O (n fi s) time where n is the number of nets and s is the number of horizontal tracks. 61 9.

Reference-contexts: Each trunk is straightened between an upper and lower contour by removing U-turns and by "corner-flipping". 59 Van Ginneken and Jess describe a channel compactor as part of a gridless system for custom building block layout <ref> [vGJ87] </ref>. First, the channel is compacted. In this step, the minimum contour of the current trunk is incorporated into the contour of the already-compacted trunks by using a recursive algorithm similar to mergesort. The second wire straightening phase processes trunks in the reverse order of compaction.

Reference-contexts: However, the channel compaction problem is slightly different than the geometric wiring problem in that channel compactors treat terminals as movable objects. Xiong and Kuh present an algorithm for a one-dimensional channel spacer <ref> [XK87] </ref>. The algorithm uses two plane sweeps to transform an initial channel layout to one with minimal channel height and minimal wire length. The first sweep pushes the channel down as far as possible and creates "all possible jogs".
