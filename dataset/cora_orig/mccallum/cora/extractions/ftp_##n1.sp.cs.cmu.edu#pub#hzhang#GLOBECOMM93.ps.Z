Abstract: Most of the solutions proposed to support guaranteed performance communication services in a packet-switching network adopt a connection-oriented and reservation-oriented approach. In this approach, the resource allocation and route selection decisions are made during connection establishment on the basis of the current resource availability and real-time 1 network load, and are usually kept for the duration of the connection's lifetime. However, such an approach shows two major limitations: first, the communication service provided is usually fixed, with limited or no capability of adapting to dynamic changes in the clients' requirements; second, a low utilization of the network may be observed. In this paper, we present a flexible management scheme that allows graceful adaptation of guaranteed performance service connections. Mechanisms have been devised to allow changing of the traffic and performance parameters of a real-time connection during its lifetime. These mechanisms, together with an adaptation policy, can make more efficient use of the network resources by performing cooperative, consenting, high-level multiplexing. We distinguish between two types of adaptation: client initiated adaptation and network initiated adaptation. We give examples for both types and we also present results from simulation experiments to show the effectiveness of our approach. fl This research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Cooperative Agreement NCR-8919038 with the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, by AT&T Bell Laboratories, Hitachi, Ltd., Hitachi America, Ltd., Pacific Bell, the University of California under a MICRO grant, and the International Computer Science Institute.

Reference-contexts: Guaranteed performance service communication is needed to support these applications as the best-effort service provided by the traditional packet-switching networks is not adequate [4].

Reference-contexts: However, since the protocol specification does not present any scheme for resource management that could provide the service guarantee, it is not clear how solutions to the two problems mentioned above can be implemented. Recently, two different solutions have been proposed to increase the adaptivity of real-time networks. In <ref> [2] </ref>, a new service, called predicted, is introduced in which the performance delivered by the network in terms of delay bounds is computed by measuring the current load, rather than by using precomputed, worst-case data. This service is proposed for a particular class of multimedia applications, called playback applications.

Reference-contexts: to a guaranteed performance connection as a channel. 3.1 The Tenet Model In the Tenet Scheme, a guaranteed performance service connection (a.k.a. a real-time channel) is a communication abstraction that defines real-time communication services associated with traffic and performance parameters in a packet-switched network in accordance with the Tenet model <ref> [5] </ref>. A channel's real-time traffic is characterized by the following parameters: X min , the minimum packet inter-arrival time, X ave , the average packet inter-arrival time over an averaging interval I, and , S max , the maximum packet size.

Reference-contexts: In addition, applications are required to be capable of enduring a high packet loss rate and even service disruption due to the adaptation of the playback point to the variations of the end-to-end communication delay. In the extended version of the CBSRP protocol <ref> [10] </ref>, the user can specify the minimum and maximum values (i.e. the minimum and maximum quality of service) for two parameters: the desired temporal and spatial resolutions of the media to be transmitted. The specified values allow the network to assign each client to a particular class of service.
