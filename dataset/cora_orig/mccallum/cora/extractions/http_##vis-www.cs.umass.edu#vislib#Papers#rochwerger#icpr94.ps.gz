Abstract: Complex problems, such as driving, can be solved by decomposing them into simpler sub-problems, solving each sub-problem, and then integrating the solutions. In the case of an autonomous vehicle, the integrated system should be able to "react" in real time to a changing environment and to "reason" about ways to achieve its goals. This paper describes the approach taken on the UMass Mobile Perception Laboratory (MPL) to integrate independent processes (each solving a particular aspect of the navigation problem) into a fully capable autonomous vehicle.

Reference-contexts: A combination of behaviors is also called a behavior, thus, a complex behavior can be achieved by combining simpler behaviors. In Brooks' subsumption architecture <ref> [3] </ref>, the task of robot control is decomposed into levels of competence; each level, in combination with lower levels, defines a behavior. <p> This section presents the cascaded filter approach used for constructing behaviors for the UMass MPL, where each behavior corresponds to one state of the FSM. One approach to constructing behaviors is the sub-sumption architecture proposed by <ref> [3] </ref>. In Brooks' original system higher level processes subsume lower level processes, i.e., whenever there is a conflict the higher level process takes control of the actuators (Figure 3). This approach for combining results can be problematic.

To make the distinction clear, we have chosen to think of a behavior as a mode of operation <ref> [7] </ref>, in which several perception-action processes [10] are executed concurrently. Each process converts sensory data into some kind of action (either physical or cognitive), and at any time may generate an event a signal to let the system know that "something" significant has occurred. <p> One possibility is simply adding a black box between the layered processes and the actuators. This box combines all the outputs in some rational way before passing them to the robot. In the DAMN <ref> [7] </ref> system, all controllable parameters are quantized into a discrete set of possible values for the parameter. Each process "votes" on each of the alternatives.

Reference-contexts: Payton, Rosen-blatt and Keirsey [7] in their Distributed Architecture for Mobile Navigation system (DAMN), refer to behaviors as very low level decision-making processes which are guided by high level plans and combined through arbitration. In their DEDS work, Ramadge and Wonham <ref> [9] </ref> consider events to form the alphabet, , of a formal language; a behavior is a sequence of events, or a string over fl . Note that in this terminology every prefix of a string is also a behavior, i.e., the sequential combination of behaviors is a behavior.

Reference-contexts: These definitions, although consistent, can be confusing the same term is used for individual processes and for the composition of these processes. To make the distinction clear, we have chosen to think of a behavior as a mode of operation [7], in which several perception-action processes <ref> [10] </ref> are executed concurrently. Each process converts sensory data into some kind of action (either physical or cognitive), and at any time may generate an event a signal to let the system know that "something" significant has occurred. <p> This example is composed of four perception-action processes: follow the road (rf ), check for traffic lights (tl ), monitor the distance traveled (dm), and stop the vehicle (vs). events to specify the system. A simple example of a system represented as a FSM is shown in Figure 2 <ref> [10] </ref>. This particular system will drive on the road a given distance while obeying traffic lights. 3 Behavior composition In the FSM model presented in the previous section, the problem of system integration is tackled at two levels. First, perception-action processes are grouped together into behaviors.
