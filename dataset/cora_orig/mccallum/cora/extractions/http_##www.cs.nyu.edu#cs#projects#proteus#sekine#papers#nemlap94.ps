Abstract: There have been a number of theoretical studies devoted to the notion of sublanguage. Furthermore, there are some successful natural language processing systems which have explicitly or implicitly utilized sublanguage restrictions. However, two big problems are still unsolved to utilize the sublanguage notion: 1) automatic definition and dynamic identification of a text to sublanguage, and 2) automatic linguistic knowledge acquisition for sublanguage. In the previous sublanguage N.L.P. systems, the domain the system is dealing with was defined by a human. This is actually one method to define the sublanguage of the text, and, in a sense, it seems to work well. However, it is not always possible and sometimes it may be wrong. In order to maximize the benefit of the sublanguage notion, we need automatic definition and dynamic sublanguage identification. We will report preliminary experiments on sublanguage definition and identification based on lexical appearance. The results of the experiments show that the methods proposed can be useful in processing a new text. In particular, the fact that the first two sentences can reliably identify a text's sublanguage encourages us in further investigation of this line of research. Also, we will describe a preliminary experiment, which aims to observe the possibilities of applying the technique on speech recognition sys tems. The result encourages to continue this line of trial. In conclusion, it appears that the inductive definition of sublanguage and sublanguage identification would be beneficial for natural language processing.

Reference-contexts: Some of them claim that the notion is important in processing natural language text, owning to lexical, syntactic or semantic restrictions, etc. A number of these studies have observed actual texts to verify the claim (Kittredge and Lehrberger, 1982) (Grishman and Kittredge, 1986) (Slocum, 1986) <ref> (Biber, 1993) </ref>. Furthermore, there are some successful natural language processing systems which have explicitly or implicitly addressed the sublanguage restrictions. For example, TAUM-METEO (Isabelle, 1984) is a machine translation system in which only sentences in the weather forecast domain are dealt with, and it works remarkably well.

Reference-contexts: From this definition, we can infer that a sublanguage can be defined empirically by observing language behavior. The other type of definition is exemplified by the following sentence in Bross, Shapio and Anderson <ref> (Bross et al., 1972) </ref>: Informally, we can define a sublanguage as the language used by a particular community of speakers, say, those concerned with a particular subject matter or those engaged in a specialized occupation.

Reference-contexts: In the future, we could probably extend this technique by using other sublanguage characteristics, i.e. syntactic and semantic restrictions. One of the recent corpus observation by Gale et al. <ref> (Gale et al., 1992) </ref> supports the usefulness of semantic restrictions. Furthermore, we could seek a hybrid concept of the two, deductive and inductive sublanguage definitions, in order to maximize the profit of the sublanguage notion. We can identify several directions for future study.

Reference-contexts: Two Definitions of Sublanguage The notion of sublanguage has been well discussed in the last decades. We can find two kinds of definitions, although the difference has not received serious attention up to now. One definition can be inferable from Zellig Harris <ref> (Harris, 1968) </ref>: Certain proper subsets of the sentences of a language may be closed under some or all of the operations defined in the language, and thus constitute a sublanguage of it. From this definition, we can infer that a sublanguage can be defined empirically by observing language behavior.

For example lexical, syntactic and semantic restrictions, a high frequency of certain constructions and use of special symbols (these factors are borrowed from Lehrberger <ref> (Lehrberger, 1982) </ref>). These factors can be useful for the inductive definition of sublanguage, as well as themselves being characteristics of sublanguage. In other words, we may be able to find sublanguages by observing texts in terms of similarities of these characteristics.

Reference-contexts: The explosion of large corpora has lead to a flowering of research on linguistic knowledge acquisition from corpora (Spe A New Direction for Sublanguage N.L.P. cial Issue, 1993a) (Special Issue, 1993b). Among them, several studies have mentioned the importance of the sublanguage notion (Grishman and Sterling, 1992) <ref> (Sekine et al., 1992) </ref>. Although these are still small experiments in terms of accuracy and coverage, they addressed the second problem listed above, and could lead to a breakthrough for future N.L.P. systems by reducing the costly and errorsome task of linguistic knowledge encoding by human linguists.

Reference-contexts: As the improvement is heavily dependent improvement deterioration 17 6 Table 5: Number of Improvement on the recognizer, it's not easy to evaluate the result. However, it must be worthwhile to continue this line of trial, because of the positive indication. A more complete experiment will be reported in <ref> (Sekine et al., 1995) </ref>. Discussion We propose "Inductive definition of sublanguage" and "Dynamic sublanguage identification". We don't deny the metric of the conventional approach to sublanguage definition. Obviously, the domain of a text is one of the very important keys of sublanguage definition.

Reference-contexts: Each article in the newspaper is regarded as a unit of data, and a sublanguage will be formed by gathering similar units in term of word appearance. This is almost identical to the text clustering technique, which has been well studied in the field of information retrieval <ref> (Willett, 1988) </ref>. However the aim of their study is slightly different from ours. They try to make clusters which are useful for human information retrieval purposes, so the linguistic features of the clusters are not so important.
