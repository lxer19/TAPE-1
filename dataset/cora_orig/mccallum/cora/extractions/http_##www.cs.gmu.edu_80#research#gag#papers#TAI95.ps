Abstract: This paper describes an approach being explored to improve the usefulness of machine learning techniques to classify complex, real world data. The approach involves the use of genetic algorithms as a "front end" to a traditional tree induction system (ID3) in order to find the best feature set to be used by the induction system. This approach has been implemented and tested on difficult texture classification problems. The results are encouraging and indicate significant advantages of the presented approach. In recent years there has been a significant increase in research on automatic image recognition in more realistic contexts. The corresponding increase in difficulty in designing effective classification procedures for the important components of these more complex recognition problems has resulted in the application of different methods to reduce the number of features used to represent the problem spaces. Many of these recognition problems are not properly represented using the reduced feature set, which makes them very sensitive to the features used to define their space. Hence, there is a strong motivation to find an appropriate representation space. This is a difficult task especially when performed manually, since the space of potential representations is very large. This has led to an interest in machine learning techniques as a possible strategy for automating the process of changing representation spaces. This paper describes part of a larger effort to apply machine learning techniques to such problems in an attempt to improve classification process required for various recognition tasks. The immediate problem attacked is that of texture recognition in the context of noise and changing lighting conditions. In this context standard induction systems such as ID3 produce classification trees that may be suboptimal in two respects. First, there is a need to minimize the number of features actually used for classification, since each feature used adds to the design and manufacturing costs as well as the running time of a recognition system. At the same time This paper describes a methodology being explored to improve the usefulness of machine learning techniques for such problems. The approach described here involves the use of genetic algorithms as a "front end" to a decision tree induction system in order to find an adequate feature space through selection and/or construction of a useful set of features to be used by the tree induction system. The results presented suggest that genetic algorithms are a useful tool for solving difficult recognition problems in which the performance of the underlying system is an important design consideration. The problem of finding good representation spaces is certainly not a new one. Both feature selection and feature construction present difficult search problems, in that they require exploration of very large search spaces. A review of previous work in these area reveals that the strategies applied are based on greedy or directed search algorithms in order to search the space more efficiently. However, these methods are very brittle and may get trapped on local peaks and produce inadequate results [8].
