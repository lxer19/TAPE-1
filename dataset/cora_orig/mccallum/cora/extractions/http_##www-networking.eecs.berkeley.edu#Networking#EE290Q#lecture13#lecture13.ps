Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the last lecture, we covered the material on statistical multiplexing of multiple time-scale traffic (see <ref> [1] </ref>) as well as the Renegotiated Constant Bit Rate (RCBR) scheme (see [2]). Today, we are going to look at the multiplexing gain obtained by sending a large number of slow time-scale traffic sources into a bufferless node.

At time t, there are total N stationary traffic sources arriving this node. See Figure 1 for an illustration. Without loss of generality, set 1 t = 0.

Reference-contexts: In the second half of the lecture, we will begin another topic which is measurement-based admission control.

At time t, there are total N stationary traffic sources arriving this node. See Figure 1 for an illustration. Without loss of generality, set 1 t = 0. <p> Therefore, measurement based admission control schemes are 3 proposed. It's a relatively young field and there are still a lot of on-going research work. We will focus on one approach described in <ref> [3] </ref>. And still assume the bufferless setup. The main goal of the measurement-based approach is to make good admission control decisions rather than trying to estimate some stochastic properties of the source.
