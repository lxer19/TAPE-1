Title: Characterizing the Distribution of Completion Shapes with Corners Using a Mixture of Random Processes

Abstract: We derive an analytic expression for the distribution of contours x(t) generated by fluctuations in _x(t) = @x(t)=@t due to stochastic impulses of two limiting types. The first type are frequent but weak while the second are infrequent but strong. The result has applications in computational theories of figural completion and illusory contours because it can be used to model the prior probability distribution of short, smooth completion shapes punctuated by occasional discontinuities in orientation (i.e., corners). This work extends our previous work on characterizing the distribution of completion shapes which dealt only with the case of frequently acting weak impulses.

Reference-contexts: The idea that the prior probability distribution of boundary completion shapes can be characterized by a directional random walk is first described by Mumford [13]. A similiar idea is implicit in Cox et al.'s use of the Kalman filter in their work on grouping of contour fragments <ref> [4] </ref>.

The distribution of shapes considered by <ref> [4, 13, 19, 20] </ref> basically consists of smooth, short contours.

In fact, for our purposes, it will suffice to include only zero or one large impulse per contour. Previously <ref> [19] </ref> we showed how P (2 j 1) =&lt; ffi (x (t 2 ) x 2 )ffi ( _x (t 2 ) _x 2 ) &gt; 1 could be obtained from an evaluation of the characteristic functional (k t ) =&lt; exp i dtk t x t &gt; 1 which since <p> As noted in Thornber and Williams <ref> [19] </ref>, a factor exp (t=t ) can be included in P (2 j 1) to reduce the role of long contours. 4 The "g" reminds us of the Gaussian nature of this limit. Note that only the product of R g and 2 g appears in the equations. <p> When the distribution is dominated by P 1 , the effect of aliasing in orientation becomes evident. 7 Conclusion In our previous paper <ref> [19] </ref>, we assumed that the statistics of occluded shapes could be modeled by minimally-constrained distributions over all paths. <p> We note that the above is valid for general Poisson processes-weak/strong, frequent/infrequent and anything in between. To evaluate P (2 j 1) for the Poisson case one simply calculates the above without the (i@=@) and for = 0, proceeding in a manner analogous to <ref> [19] </ref>.
