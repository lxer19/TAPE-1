Abstract: In the last decade research in Machine Learning has developed a variety of powerful tools for inductive learning and data analysis. On the other hand, research in International Relations has developed a variety of different conflict databases that are mostly analyzed with classical statistical methods. As these databases are in general of a symbolic nature, they provide an interesting domain for application of Machine Learning algorithms. This paper gives a short overview of available conflict databases and subsequently concentrates on the application of machine learning methods for the analysis and interpretation of such databases.

Reference-contexts: Each event in this dataset was encoded with 52 attributes and one class variable that indicated whether the attempt has been successful or not. As the basic induction algorithm we chose the standard decision-tree learning algorithm C4.5 <ref> (Quinlan 1993) </ref>, because of its availability and flexibility. In a first attempt we generated and analyzed an unpruned tree with C4.5 (section 3.1). <p> Therefore it seems natural to consider pruning heuristics to obtain simpler trees and rules. 3.2 Analyzing Pruned Trees Table 2 gives an overview of some results we have achieved with different settings of two parameters of the standard decision-tree learning algorithm C4.5 <ref> (Quinlan 1993) </ref>. For each setting we report the number of nodes (including leaves) in the generated tree (Size), the percentage of the training examples that will be correctly classified by the tree (Purity), and the predictive accuracy estimated by a 10-fold cross-validation and its standard deviation (Stone 1974).
