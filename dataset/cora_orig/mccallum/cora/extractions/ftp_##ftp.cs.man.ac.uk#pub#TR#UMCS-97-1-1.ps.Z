IN such that, for all n &gt; 0, if A is any connected partition in P with n members and G is a piecewise linear graph* with no nodes of degree 2 whose faces in the open plane <p> The following lemmas are concerned with showing that P is, in a sense that will become clear below, topologically homogeneous. It is well-known that every finite plane graph G in the open plane can be continuously deformed into piecewise linear plane graph G 0 . (See, e.g. Bollobas <ref> [6] </ref>, p.16.) Indeed, this can be done in such a way that piecewise linear edges in G are unaffected. In effect, finite plane graphs can have their edges `straightened out' by a homeomorphism, without affecting any points in those faces whose boundaries involve only straight edges.

Reference-contexts: A model A is said to be atomic if any n-tuple a in A satisfies a formula OE (x) in A such that OE (x) is complete in Th (A). Then we have the following standard result from Chang and Keisler <ref> [11] </ref>: 12 Theorem 5 (Chang and Keisler: 2.3.4) A model is countable atomic if and only if it is prime. Our task, then, is to show that Q is atomic. The following results will also feature in the sequel.

Reference-contexts: Yet various authors have sought to reverse this order of rational reconstruction, treating regions as primary, and admitting points, if at all, as logical constructions out of them. The best known of these approaches is perhaps Tarski's <ref> [36] </ref> axiomatization of Euclidean geometry, taking spheres to be the primitive entities. But the policy of taking regions as primitive is most attractive when considering problems involving mereological (part-whole) and topological notions|that is, where no metric information is to hand.

Reference-contexts: Various logicians have sought to give deductive theories of space and space-time [8, 4, 20, 17, 23], many in terms of modal logics <ref> [31, 32, 39, 33, 35, 3, 27] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: If regions are first class entities and points are logical constructions based on them, then who knows what interesting new ways of considering spatial entities and relations there might be? Clarke [12], [13], following an idea of Whitehead <ref> [40] </ref>, sought to reconstruct mereotopology in terms of a primitive relation of connection holding between regions. Following this work, Biacino and Gerla [5] have studied models of Clarke's theory.
