Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction With the increase of cell density, not only does the probability of memory failures increase, but the nature of the failure modes becomes more complex and subtle <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Many RAM test algorithms based on different fault models have been proposed. Activeness of test algorithms depends on the accuracy of the fault model, which is used to represent the physical failures [2, 3].

Activeness of test algorithms depends on the accuracy of the fault model, which is used to represent the physical failures <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. A widely used fault model for RAM devices was proposed by Nair et. al [4]. In this model, defects in the address decoder and the Read/Write logic are mapped onto functionally equivalent faults in the memory array. <p> We consider both functional and IDDQ monitoring. All major transistor faults are considered assuming hard shorts for the bridging faults. 2 Faults in Register Storage Elements Recent studies have shown that the traditional stuck-at fault model is insufficient for modeling faults in storage elements. Reference <ref> [2] </ref> shows that a significant fraction of faults cannot be modeled as input/output stuck-at-0/1 for elementary register storage elements. Consider for example, the transmission-gate latch in Figure 1. Some faults cause the cell to exhibit data-feed-through behavior, i.e. the input data D or D is propagated to the output.

Reference-contexts: Many RAM test algorithms based on different fault models have been proposed. Activeness of test algorithms depends on the accuracy of the fault model, which is used to represent the physical failures <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. A widely used fault model for RAM devices was proposed by Nair et. al [4]. In this model, defects in the address decoder and the Read/Write logic are mapped onto functionally equivalent faults in the memory array. <p> The two pull-up transistors of the inverters have minimum size to retain charge lost due to leakage current [6]. Although this cell is a storage element, the observations given in <ref> [3] </ref> for the fault analysis of the elementary storage elements cannot be applied for SRAM cells. This is because the SRAM is a symmetric structure with complimentary bidirectional inputs/outputs and the cell is only indirectly observable via the read circuitry.

Reference-contexts: Some faults cause the cell to exhibit data-feed-through behavior, i.e. the input data D or D is propagated to the output. Other faults cause the cell to exhibit clock-feed-through, i.e CLK or CLK is propagated to the output. These effects are discussed in <ref> [5] </ref> shows in detail. Besides the feed-through behaviors, some faults cause logic non-retention problems, always (NR) or conditionally (CNR). This means that cell works properly in the transparent phase, but not in the latching phase.
