Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction It has become common practice to use digital computers in real-time applications such as industrial process control. Typically, sensory data is periodically transmitted over a communication network or "data highway" to a digital computer that is responsible for controlling the process <ref> [1] </ref>. A salient feature of such systems is that they often have stringent timing requirements. A timing failure could lead to catastrophe. Further, these systems are often distributed.

Reference-contexts: The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as representing official positions or policies of NSF, ONR, or Texas A&M University. Our discussion will concentrate on the timed token protocol <ref> [2] </ref>. The timed token proto-col is a token passing protocol in which each node gets a guaranteed share of the network bandwidth. Partly because of this property, the timed token protocol has been incorporated into a number of network standards. <p> In the timed token protocol, access to the communication medium is controlled by a token that is passed among the nodes in a circular fashion. Messages in the timed token protocol are segregated into two separate classes: the synchronous class and the asynchronous class <ref> [2] </ref>. Synchronous messages are given a guaranteed share of the network bandwidth, and are used for real-time communication. That is, they may be associated with deadline constraints. We will focus on meeting the deadlines of synchronous messages.

Partly because of this property, the timed token protocol has been incorporated into a number of network standards. These standards include the IEEE 802.4 token bus standard <ref> [3] </ref>, the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) standard [4], and the Survivable Adaptable Fiber optic Embedded NETwork (SAFENET) [5]. Networks based on these standards are becoming increasingly popular in new generation real-time systems.

In particular, the IEEE 802.4 standard is included in the Manufacturing Automation Protocol (MAP) [6] for computer integrated manufacturing which has been widely used in industrial applications.

Guaranteeing message deadlines requires proper control of medium access. In the timed token protocol, access to the communication medium is controlled by a token that is passed among the nodes in a circular fashion.

Reference-contexts: Let t be the token walk time around the network. The proportion of time taken due to token walking is given by t =TTRT . The maximum network utilization available to user applications is then 1 t =TTRT <ref> [7] </ref>. A smaller TTRT results in less available utilization and limits the network capacity. On the other hand, if TTRT is too large, the token may not arrive often enough at a node in order to meet message deadlines. * Each node has buffers for outgoing and incoming synchronous messages.

Reference-contexts: Note that in the above inequality, t i;j and D i are given by the application, but s i;j depends on the synchronous bandwidth allocation and the choice of TTRT. Johnson and Sevcik <ref> [8] </ref> showed that the maximum amount of time that may pass between two consecutive token arrivals at a node can approach 2TTRT . This bound holds regardless of the behavior of asynchronous messages in the network.

Reference-contexts: given the previously demonstrated good performance of local schemes and their desirable network management properties, we concentrate on local synchronous bandwidth allocation schemes in this paper. 3.2 A Local Allocation Scheme Several local synchronous bandwidth allocation schemes have been proposed, both for the case of D i = P i <ref> [9] </ref> and for the case of D i 6= P i [10, 11]. These schemes all have a similar worst case performance. We will consider the scheme proposed in [10]. <p> From (7) it can be shown that when D min approaches infinity, U fl approaches (1 ff) = (1 t =TTRT ). That is, as the deadlines become larger, the worst case achievable utilization approaches the available utilization of the network. 2. In <ref> [9] </ref>, it was shown that for a system in which all relative deadlines are equal to the corresponding message periods (D i = P i ), a worst case achievable utilization of 1 3 (1ff) can be achieved.

This transmission time is available regardless of the number of asynchronous messages in the network. During these D i time units, U i D i can loosely be regarded as the load on node i. <p> Thus the synchronous bandwidth in (6) is just sufficient to handle the load on node i between the arrival of a message and its deadline. The scheme defined in (6) is a simplified version of those in <ref> [10, 11] </ref>. We concentrate on the scheme in (6) because it is simple, intuitive, and well understood. <p> Thus, we would like to choose TTRT in an optimal fashion | so that the worst case achievable utilization U fl is maximized. This will increase the amount of real-time traffic that can be supported by the network. The optimal value of TTRT has been derived in <ref> [10] </ref> and is given by TTRT = D min 3+ 9+ 8D min 2 e The impact of an appropriate selection of TTRT is further evident from Figure 2, which uses (8) to show U fl versus TTRT for several different values of D min .
