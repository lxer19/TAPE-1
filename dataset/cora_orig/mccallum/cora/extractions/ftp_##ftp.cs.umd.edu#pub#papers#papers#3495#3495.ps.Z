Abstract: Traffic shapers by preventing congestion and smoothing the traffic, play an important role in realizing the traffic control schemes employed in high speed networks to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the application. In this report, we present a generic architecture for programmable traffic shaper for high speed networks. The programmability of the proposed architecture is illustrated by implementing some of the existing traffic shaping schemes. The architectural design issues of the proposed scheme are described and discussed.

Reference-contexts: Several bandwidth management schemes such as peak-rate allocation, minimum throughput allocation and bursty traffic specification, and a number of congestion control schemes such as preventive, reactive and adaptive congestion control schemes were proposed to address this issue <ref> [9, 1] </ref>. Hence, traffic shaping at the source is essential to guarantee QoS and to avoid congestion. The basic idea behind traffic shaping is to control the input traffic so that it is amenable to the scheduling mechanism at the switches for providing the required QoS guarantees.

Reference-contexts: In the following three sections we illustrate the programmability of the proposed scheme by implementing three common admission control schemes viz., the leaky bucket (LB) scheme, window-based (Jumping window) schemes and SRTS scheme. 3.3 Implementation of Leaky Bucket Scheme Leaky bucket (LB) scheme and its variants basically emphasize bandwidth enforcement <ref> [2] </ref> by limiting the cell admission rate to a negotiated rate. The cells are admitted in this scheme only when it can draw a token from a token pool of finite capacity, say . The token pool is replenished with new tokens at a fixed rate.

Reference-contexts: The shaping scheme should be easily programmable. 2. The traffic shaper should be independent of any specific policing mech anism. 3.

Reference-contexts: Several mechanisms have been proposed for traffic shaping. These may be broadly classified into two groups viz., Leaky bucket type mechanisms and window based mechanisms. Performance comparison of the above mentioned traffic shaping schemes can be found in [8]. A flexible shift register based traffic shaping (SRTS) scheme <ref> [4, 5, 6, 7] </ref> proposed recently claims to have better the performance figures in comparison with leaky bucket scheme. SRTS scheme is based on the temporal profile of the packet stream admitted by the shaper over a fixed time frame. <p> SRTS can adjust the burstiness of the input traffic to obtain reasonable bandwidth utilization while maintaining statistical service guarantees <ref> [4, 5, 6, 7] </ref>. The SRTS admit control function makes use of the temporal history (maintained by a shift register) of the cells admitted. <p> Hence, in the rest of this report we will be describing the architecture of only one stream for simplicity. 4.1 Shift register and interconnection network Fig. 2 shows a preliminary architecture based on a shift register to keep track of the temporal profile as in the SRTS scheme proposed in <ref> [4] </ref>. A n-bit long shift register is used to store the temporal history of the cells admitted in the last n time slots, where each time slot t = 1=N and N is the current peak rate. <p> This may cause a cell arriving during an idle slot but otherwise eligible to be admitted to be delayed by t in the worst case. In order to minimize this admission delay at the traffic shaper, the "soft" discretization technique proposed in <ref> [4] </ref> may be used. The idea is to sample the input at a higher speed within each time slot t using a main clock (main-CLK).

The dynamic reaction time of the mechanism should be short to avoid flooding of the buffers in the network [8]. The first two requirements are for making the traffic shaper generic so that the best traffic shaping mechanism can be chosen based on the traffic characteristics and QoS requirements. The items 3-5 are more applicable to the technique used for policing the traffic.
