Reference-contexts: If we concentrate only on finite metric spaces, the well-known k-server conjecture simply states that this lower bound is achievable. Since the k-server conjecture holds for metric spaces with k +1 points, the 1-evader problem (also called the pursuit-evade game <ref> [BKRS92] </ref>) has competitive ratio m 1. For the 2-evader problem, in the general case the best known upper bound of the competitive ratio is 2m 5, the counterpart of the upper bound of 2k1 of the competitive ratio for the k-server problem [KP95, Kou94].

Reference-contexts: One can define different variants of the `-evader problem by assigning to each point p a capacity c (p) such that no more than c (p) evaders can reside at p at the same time. When every point has capacity one, the problem relates to the well-known k-server problem <ref> [MMS90, KP95] </ref>. <p> For the 2-evader problem, in the general case the best known upper bound of the competitive ratio is 2m 5, the counterpart of the upper bound of 2k1 of the competitive ratio for the k-server problem <ref> [KP95, Kou94] </ref>. For certain special metric spaces such as uniform metric spaces and tree metric spaces it is known that the lower bound of m 2 is tight [ST85, CL91]. In this paper we generalize this to any metric space: the 2-evader problem 2 has competitive ratio m 2. <p> The algorithm we employ is the work function algorithm; it is widely believed that the same algorithm has competitive ratio m ` for any number ` of evaders. Our proof of the competitiveness of the work function algorithm uses the duality property introduced in <ref> [KP95] </ref>; the argument then rests on a novel potential that we introduce, based on minimum spanning trees. The complexity of the potential in this relatively simple case is indicative of why the k-server conjecture is still unsettled. <p> Conceivably, the techniques we employ here can be useful for the general case (actually, it was this result that eventually led us to the 2k 1 upper bound for the k-server problem <ref> [KP95] </ref>). <p> Here are some important properties of the work functions (for a proof see <ref> [KP95, Kou94] </ref>): 3 Lemma 1 Let w be a work function and let w 0 be the resulting work function after one more ejection r. <p> The following lemma allows us to deduce the competitiveness of the work function algorithm from a condition about work functions (see <ref> [KP95, Kou94] </ref> or [CL92] for a proof). <p> For the `-evader problem the graph becomes a hypergraph.

Reference-contexts: One can define different variants of the `-evader problem by assigning to each point p a capacity c (p) such that no more than c (p) evaders can reside at p at the same time. When every point has capacity one, the problem relates to the well-known k-server problem <ref> [MMS90, KP95] </ref>. <p> It was pointed out in <ref> [MMS90] </ref> that for any non-lazy algorithm there exists a lazy algorithm with the same or better performance). Consequently, any result for the `-evader problem with all capacities equal to one translates immediately to a result for the k-server problem and vice-versa. <p> There are very few results in the literature concerning directly the `- evader problem. On the other hand, any result for the k-server problem can be translated to a result for the (m k)-evader problem. In particular, it is known <ref> [MMS90] </ref> that the k-server problem has competitive ratio at least k on any metric space with at least k + 1 points. This translates to a lower bound of m ` for the competitive ratio of the `-evader problem on any metric with m points. <p> In this paper we generalize this to any metric space: the 2-evader problem 2 has competitive ratio m 2. Via the correspondence outlined above, this implies that the k-server conjecture holds for metric spaces with k + 2 points (it was known since <ref> [MMS90] </ref> that it holds in k + 1 points). The algorithm we employ is the work function algorithm; it is widely believed that the same algorithm has competitive ratio m ` for any number ` of evaders.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we shall restrict our attention to the unit capacity case of the `-evader problem.

In this paper we generalize this to any metric space: the 2-evader problem 2 has competitive ratio m 2.
