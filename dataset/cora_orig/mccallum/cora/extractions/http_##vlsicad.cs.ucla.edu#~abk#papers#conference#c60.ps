Abstract: Elmore delay has been widely used as an analytical estimate of interconnect delays in the performance-driven synthesis and layout of VLSI routing topologies. However, for typical RLC interconnectionswith ramp input, Elmore delay can deviate by up to 100% or more from SPICE-computed delay since it is independent of rise time of the input ramp signal. We develop new analytical delay models based on the first and second moments of the interconnect transfer function when the input is a ramp signal with finite rise time. Delay estimates using our first moment based analytical models are within 4% of SPICE-computed delay, and models based on both first and second moments are within 2:3% of SPICE, across a wide range of interconnect parameter values. Evaluation of our analytical models is several orders of magnitude faster than simulation using SPICE. We also describe extensions of our approach for estimation of source-sink delays in arbitrary interconnect trees.

Reference-contexts: Simulation methods such as SPICE give the most accurate insight into arbitrary interconnect structures, but are computationally expensive. Faster methods based on moment matching techniques are proposed in [12, 13, 14, 17], but are still too expensive to be used during layout optimization. Thus, Elmore delay <ref> [2] </ref>, a first order approximation of delay under step input, is still the most widely used delay model in the performance-driven synthesis of clock distribution and Steiner global routing topologies. <p> Elmore delay <ref> [2] </ref> is a first order delay estimate for interconnect lines under step input. It is equal to the first moment of the system impulse response, i.e., the coefficient of s or the first moment in the system transfer function H (s). <p> Their model gives accurate estimates compared to SPICE-computed delays, but is valid only for step inputs. We now give two distinct derivations of an analytical ramp delay estimate. Elmore Definition. Applying Elmore's original definition of delay for step input <ref> [2] </ref> yields an analytical delay T AD for ramp input, i.e., T AD = V 0 0 out (t)dt (2) where v 0 out (t) is the derivative of the output response under finite ramp input.

Reference-contexts: Previous moment-based approaches [12, 14, 17] can compute a response for interconnects under ramp input within a simulation-based methodology, but no previous work has given analytical delay estimation models based on the first few moments. Recently, <ref> [3] </ref> presented lower and upper bounds for the ramp input response; their delay model is the same as the Elmore model for ramp input (we refer to this model as analytical ramp input model (T AD ) in this paper).

Reference-contexts: Delay estimates for the analytical ramp input model are off by as much as 50% from SPICE-computed delays for 50% threshold voltage, and the analytical ramp input model cannot be used to obtain threshold delay for various threshold voltages. The authors of <ref> [5] </ref> used Elmore delay as an upper bound on the 50% threshold delay for RC interconnection lines under arbitrary input waveforms. <p> The step input delay is computed using the Elmore delay formula and then multiplying it with the appropriate constant for the given threshold voltage. For example, Elmore delay at 50% threshold voltage is 0:69b 1 and at 90% threshold voltage is 2:3b 1 . Unlike <ref> [5] </ref>, we find that Elmore delay is not at all close to SPICE-computed 50% threshold delays and, depending on the rise time of the signal and driver resistance, can be either greater or less than SPICE-computed delays (e.g., when the rise time is 500 ps the Elmore delay is for most

Reference-contexts: Although Elmore delay has been widely used for interconnect timing analysis, it cannot accurately estimate the delay for RLC interconnect lines, which are the appropriate representation for interconnects whose inductive impedance cannot be neglected <ref> [6] </ref>. 2 More critically, Elmore delay cannot estimate delays when the input signal is a ramp. 3 Analytical Ramp Delay Definitions In practice, the input at any gate or root of a tree is a ramp with finite rise (or fall) time, and there are no published analytical delay models for
