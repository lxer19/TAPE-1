Reference: 1. <editor> First we look at a single address's behavior without considering other ad dresses. </editor> <title> This we call the Single address profile. </title>
Reference-contexts: This is also a generative model. This technique is shown to have similar hit-ratio curves as the traces it is validated against. 7. Agarwal et al <ref> [1] </ref> model cache miss behavior using four parameters. The first parameter Start-up effect, occurs when a program starts and the number of misses is the number of unique lines referred to.

Reference: 2. <editor> Certain IRG values never occur (vertical gaps in the histogram plots), </editor> <title> and those that do occur form a small fraction of the possible IRG values. </title>
Reference: 3. <institution> A high degree of skew in the frequencies towards smaller values of IRG. </institution>
Reference-contexts: It can be assumed that items are numbered so that the probabilities satisfy p 1 p 2 ::: p N . Due to its simplicity, this model has been extensively used in analytical reasoning about memory management algorithms <ref> [47, 3, 33, 5, 76, 64, 6, 22, 9, 57, 59] </ref>. b. Markov Model: The obvious generalization of the IRM is the Markov model, which describes the reference string r 1 ,r 2 , ... by an ergodic, finite Markov chain. <p> King [47] analyzes LRU, FIFO and A 0 (keeping items with the largest probability of reference) for the Independent Reference Model (IRM) and gives a general framework for analyzing replacement algorithms under the IRM model. Aho et al <ref> [3] </ref> demonstrate A 0 to be optimal under the IRM model.
