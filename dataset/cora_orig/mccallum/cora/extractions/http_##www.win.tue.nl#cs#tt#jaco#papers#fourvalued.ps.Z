Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This note presents a complete axiomatisation for four-valued sequential logic. `Sequential' means that arguments are evaluated from left to right, until an answer can be obtained. Three-valued sequential logic is due to McCarthy [6]. In <ref> [1] </ref> four truth-values are introduced: true, false, mistake and divergent. Several four-valued logics arise by restricting the set of connectives.

Our proof yields a systematic method to prove each valid formula from the axioms. 1 2 Four-valued Sequential Logic Following <ref> [1] </ref> we extend the usual truth values t and f (for true and false) with two other constants d and m, modeling a diverging computation and an error-situation (i.e. a mistake has been made and there is no point in going on). <p> Here a mistake is not always reported. Some typical equations are: The system that extends the truth values ft; f; m; dg with connectives o 1 ; : : : ; o n is denoted by 4 (o 1 ; : : : ; o n ). In <ref> [1] </ref> it is proved that the system 4 (: ; ^ ; # ; ^ b ) is truth-functionally complete. This means that every four-valued function can be expressed in terms of the truth values, combined with negation, conjunction, definedness and the left sequential conjunction.

Reference-contexts: Interpret ^ b as the restriction of ^ (Table 1) on the carrier set, and _ b as the restriction of _. (This model is known as Kleene's three-valued logic <ref> [5] </ref>). We have no argument for the independence of laws (8) and (9). It is easy to make a 5-valued model in which (1)-(7) and (10) are valid, but where (8) and (9) fail, so they cannot be dropped both.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This note presents a complete axiomatisation for four-valued sequential logic. `Sequential' means that arguments are evaluated from left to right, until an answer can be obtained. Three-valued sequential logic is due to McCarthy <ref> [6] </ref>. In [1] four truth-values are introduced: true, false, mistake and divergent. Several four-valued logics arise by restricting the set of connectives. In the nomenclature of [1], four-valued sequential logic is characterized as 4 (: ; ^ b ; _ b axiomatisation of this system has not been given before. <p> By equational logic, we find ` P = Q. fi 4 Remarks Extension. The existence of at least two error values is needed in the proof of Theorem 3.7 to make sure that X j Y . If there is only one error value (i.e. MacCarthy's logic <ref> [6] </ref>) then the following law becomes valid; note that the leftmost variable changes: ((X ^ b Y ) _ (Y ^ b X)) = ((Y ^ b X) _ (X ^ b Y )) : Our proof easily generalizes to more than two error values.
