Abstract: Propositional STRIPS planning problems can be viewed as finite state automata (FSAs) represented in a factored form. Automaton minimization is a well-known technique for reducing the size of an explicit FSA. Recent work in computer-aided verification on model checking has extended this technique to provide automaton minimization algorithms for factored FSAs. In this paper, we consider the relationship between STRIPS problem-solving techniques such as regression and the recently developed automaton minimization techniques for factored FSAs. We show that regression computes a partial and approximate minimized form of the FSA corresponding to the STRIPS problem. We then define a systematic form of regression which computes a partial but exact minimized form of the associated FSA. We also relate minimization to methods for performing reachability analysis to detect irrelevant flu-ents. Finally, we show that exact computation of the minimized automaton is NP-complete under the assumption that this automaton is polynomial in size.

Reference-contexts: In [ Dean and Givan, 1997 ] we show how model minimization can be used to solve implicit (or factored) Markov decision processes (MDPs) with very large state spaces, and prove that our model minimization based algorithms are asymptotically equivalent to existing methods (e.g., <ref> [ Boutilier et al., 1995 ] </ref> ) that operate on implicit MDPs. In [ Dean et al., 1997 ] we show how model reduction techniques can be used to trade time for space in computing approximately optimal solutions to Markov decision processes.

Reference-contexts: Finally, it is of interest to consider the class of classical planning problems for which the minimized model is polynomial in the size of the input. In general, the problem of finding a solution to a STRIPS planning problem is PSPACE-complete <ref> [ Bylander, 1994 ] </ref> . However, the class of solvable STRIPS planning instances with polynomial-sized models is in NP, as one can simply guess the polynomial-sized model. <p> Figure 2 (b) shows a reduced model generated using an adequate but nonoptimal splitting operation, FSPLIT, which we define later. Complexity of Minimization. There are planning problems for which the shortest solution is exponentially long in the length of the problem description <ref> [ Bylander, 1994 ] </ref> . This fact directly implies that there are problems with exponentially large minimal models, and therefore that minimization must take at least exponential time. However, one might hope that in those cases where the minimal model is "small", minimization could find it quickly.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper, classical planning refers to the propositional variant of STRIPS planning <ref> [ Fikes and Nilsson, 1971 ] </ref> . Classical planning is based on a factored representation for describing planning domains in terms of rules that specify how the dynamic features of the domain (called fluents) change over time.

Reference-contexts: an unsatisfiability test at each node which is NP-hard; in practice the usefulness of systematic regression will be limited to those cases where there is substantial overlap between subgoals (i.e., many different action sequences have similar effects) and will depend on the growing efficiency of the best known satisfiability testers <ref> [ Selman et al., 1992 ] </ref> . Theorem 4 Unlike simple regression, systematic regression never generates more subgoals than there are blocks in the minimal model. 5 Reachability Analysis Computing the minimal model for a planning problem relies critically on the SPLIT operation, which we've indicated can have exponential cost.
