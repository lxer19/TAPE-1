Abstract: We develop a non-parametric method of nonlinear prediction based on adaptive partitioning of the phase space associated with the process. The partitioning method is implemented with a recursive tree-structured vector quantization algorithm which successively refines the partition by binary splitting where the splitting threshold is determined by a penalized maximum entropy criterion. A complexity penalty is derived and applied to protect against high statistical variability of the predictor structure. We establish an important relation between our tree-structured model for the process and generalized non-linear thresholded AR model (ART). We illustrate our method for two cases where classical linear prediction is ineffective: a chaotic "double-scroll" signal measured at the output of a Chua-type electronic circuit, and a simulated second order ART model.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Tree-based models were first introduced as a non-parametric exploratory data analysis technique for non-additive statistical models <ref> [1] </ref>. The tree-based model represents the data in a hierarchical structure where the leaves of the tree induce a non-uniform partition of the data space. Each leaf can be labeled by a scalar or vector value of a one-step predictor, a non-linear response variable, or a multi-variable quantizer output. <p> t (p 1)) = x p1 is given by the following function of the histogram: b X q (k) = l=1 1 q l 1 q l ; x 1 ; : : : ; x p1 ) 8e T P X q (e T (1) where e 1 = <ref> [1; 0; : : : ; 0] </ref> T .

Reference-contexts: Once a cost-complexity metric is specified, the tree can then be recursively grown to efficiently perform particular tasks such as non-linear prediction, pattern classification, and vector quantization (VQ) <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. The tree-based approach has the several attractive features. Unlike likelihood approaches no parametric model is required, however if one is available it can be incorporated into the tree structure as a constraint.

Reference-contexts: This paper presents an approach to tree structured signal modeling and prediction based on a maximum entropy recursive partitioning of the signal phase space and the local singular value decomposition (SVD). We use the Tak-ens <ref> [4] </ref> time delay embedding method to construct a phase space for the signal which captures the linear or non-linear dynamics of any finite dimensional state model. <p> The reconstruction delay t was chosen in such a way to minimize the mutual information between the coordinates (see [5] and <ref> [4] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: By implementing a local SVD over each node of the tree prior to performing the uniformity test we obtain a hierarchical signal model which is very similar to the non-linear auto-regressive (AR) threshold model, referred to as SETAR in <ref> [7] </ref>. This threshold model has been proposed for many physical signal models involving stochastic resonance and bistable/multi-stable trajectories such as ECG cardiac signals, EEG brain signals, turbulent flow, economic time series and chaotic signals. 2. <p> Thus, in view of relation (2), we obtain a set of piecewise state-conditioned (and possibly unstable) AR models for X (k). This specifies an AR-threshold (ART) model, which is very similar to the SETAR model <ref> [7] </ref>, for which the transition from one AR model to another is controlled by a values of all coordinates of the phase space. 4. EXAMPLES First we illustrate a tree-based one step forward quantized prediction (as described in section 3) for chaotic time series.
