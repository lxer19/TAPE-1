Title: CONVEX HULLS OF f- AND fi-VECTORS  
Author: DMITRY N. KOZLOV 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the convex hulls of the sets of f- and fi-vectors of different classes of simplicial complexes on n vertices. These include flag complexes, order posets, matroid complexes and general abstract simplicial complexes. As a result of this investigation, standard linear programming problems on these sets can be solved, including maximization of the Euler characteristics or of the sum of the Betti numbers.

Reference-contexts: We will denote this graph by T r (n) or just T r . The Turan graphs come up in different contexts all over extremal graph theory and are optimal in many senses (one can find a nice survey in <ref> [B] </ref>). In our case they turn out to determine the corners in the convex hulls of the sets of f -vectors and fi-vectors of flag complexes.

Reference-contexts: For example Theorem 1.4 in <ref> [BK] </ref> answers the question: what is the maximum of the Euler characteristic and the sum of the Betti numbers of an abstract simplicial complex. Some other papers where similiar questions have been treated are [Koz],[Mar],[Re], [SYZ],[Z]. Relations between f and fi-vectors were studied, see for example [BK],[May]. <p> Note. Observe that the f -vectors of simplicial complexes on n vertices are completely characterized by the Kruskal-Katona theorem, see [Kr],[Ka]. Also the characterization for the set of fi-vectors can be obtained through the Theorem 1.3 in <ref> [BK] </ref> and the characterization of the f -vectors of Sperner families, independently discovered by [C] and [DGH]. Corollary 4.3.

Reference-contexts: Say S 0 = X i , then S = (X i n fxg) [ fyg and so S 2 C fl . Observe that an (x; y)-compression is different from another similiar and frequently used operation on simplicial complexes called an (i; j)-shift (see Chapter 4 in <ref> [F] </ref> for a description).

Reference-contexts: have to prove that f k1 = n k + 1 or that f k1 n k which after cancellation of common factors from factorials transforms into (n k)f k1 (k + 1)f k (5.1) This inequality is well known and can be found in, for example, Section 8 of <ref> [GK] </ref>. We give here a short simple argument. Let C to be a simplicial complex with f-vector (f 0 ; : : : ; f n1 ) and let us count pairs (A; B), where A; B 2 C, jAj = k + 1, jBj = k and B A.

The case of simplicial complexes In this section we consider the same problem as above for the class of simplicial complexes on n vertices. First we introduce some notation.

Reference-contexts: Proof: Matroid complexes are just a special case of simplicial complexes, on the other hand, the complete k-skeletons correspond to uniform matroids (see <ref> [W] </ref> for the definition), hence the result follows. Note. It would be interesting to define the corresponding convex hulls for more restricted classes of matroids, for example for the class of graphic matroids. 5.
