Reference-contexts: Our goal is to extend standard SQL only as far as to make it a reasonable tool to manipulate and retrieve spatial data. The principle demand of `Spatial SQL' is to provide a higher abstraction of spatial data by incorporating concepts closer to humans' perception of space <ref> [Egenhofer, 1994] </ref>. This is accomplished by incorporating the object-oriented concept of user-defined abstract data types (ADT). An ADT is a user-defined atomic type and its associated functions. <p> An extension of SQL must be able to handle queries that fall into three broad categories: 1) Queries which deal exclusively with spatial attributes. 2) Non-spatial queries and 3) queries that combine non-spatial and spatial data. Some of the requirement of spatial query language <ref> [Egenhofer, 1994] </ref> are shown in the following table : Most of these requirements deal with the interaction and display of data. Our focus is more on the functional enhancements of the query language to deal with spatial data.

Reference-contexts: Our focus is more on the functional enhancements of the query language to deal with spatial data. For this we turn to the OGIS specification <ref> [OpenGIS, 1998] </ref> for the extension of SQL92 to incorporate Geometry Types. 3.3 OGIS extension for SQL92 The OGIS specification defines a standard for SQL which supports the storage and query of spatial data.

Reference-contexts: In section 3.3 we revisit the Forest example introduced in Chapter 2, and pose spatial queries using the OGIS extension of SQL. 3.1 Relational Algebra Relational algebra is a formal query language associated with the relational model <ref> [Ramakrishnan, 1998] </ref>. There are five basic operators in this algebra selection, projection, union, cross-product, difference. The fundamental property of all of these operators is that they accept relations as arguments and return a relation as the result.

Reference-contexts: SQL cannot process data stored as blobs and it is the responsibility of the user's application program to handle data in blob form <ref> [Stonebraker and Moore, 1997] </ref>. This solution is not efficient nor aesthetic because the data is now dependent upon the host-language application code.
