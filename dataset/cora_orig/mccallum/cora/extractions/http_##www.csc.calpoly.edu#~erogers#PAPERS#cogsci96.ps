Title: A Study of Visual Reasoning in Medical Diagnosis  
Author: Erika Rogers 
Address: Clark Atlanta University Atlanta, GA 30314  
Affiliation: Dept. of Computer Information Science  
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to describe experimental work conducted in the area of diagnostic radiology, with an emphasis on how perception and problem solving interact in this type of task. This work was part of a larger project whose goals included the development of an information-processing model of visual interaction, and the subsequent design of an intelligent cooperative assistant for this domain. Verbal protocol data was collected from eight radiologists (six residents and two experts) while they examined seven different computer-displayed chest x-rays. A brief overview of the methodology and analysis techniques is presented, together with specific results from one x-ray case. More general results are then discussed in the framework of issues important to the later modeling effort.

Reference-contexts: An example is shown in Figure 8, taken from a subject's report on the tuberculosis case. In other cases, features were sought which led to either more specific finding hypotheses, or even diagnostic hypotheses. Thus the data supports the claim that the direction of reasoning provides the procedural context <ref> (Evans & Gadd, 1989) </ref>, and that there are different types of plans, and different levels of planning. Furthermore, the direction of reasoning affected the different types of perceptual information used to support the diagnostic stages.

Reference-contexts: The purpose of this paper is to describe some of the initial experimental work, and to show how it led to insights about visual reasoning activities. Studies of the radiological process have varied from eye movement studies <ref> (Kundel & Nodine, 1975) </ref>, to task-related hand movements (McNeill et al., 1988), to cognitive modeling studies of expertise involving think-aloud verbal protocols (Lesgold et al., 1981). <p> This type of attentional behavior has also been described by Kundel and Nodine who showed that even under restricted conditions, selective attention was drawn to the area of the chest having the greatest abnormality <ref> (Kundel & Nodine, 1975) </ref>. In more general experiments on attention, Treisman showed that simple property differences (e.g., color, brightness, or line orientation) would be seized upon by the initial stage of visual processing so that they appear to pop out of a scene (Treis-man, 1982).

Reference-contexts: Studies of the radiological process have varied from eye movement studies (Kundel & Nodine, 1975), to task-related hand movements (McNeill et al., 1988), to cognitive modeling studies of expertise involving think-aloud verbal protocols <ref> (Lesgold et al., 1981) </ref>. While the latter provided the strongest methodological guidelines for the study described in this paper, more emphasis was placed on the range of novice-expert performance rather than on the differences. <p> Therefore, the first goal was to develop an appropriate encoding scheme which would enable these kinds of concepts to be extracted from the verbal reports. A preliminary task analysis combined some of the earlier experimental results with Lesgold's task description of radiological diagnosis <ref> (Lesgold et al., 1981) </ref> and other problem solving concepts in medical diagnosis.

Reference-contexts: A preliminary study on the effects of the laboratory environment and the computerized images showed no noticeable impact on the subjects' ability to perform diagnosis <ref> (Rogers, 1992) </ref>, and therefore the next phase proceeded with more extensive think-aloud protocol collection. Data Collection and Analysis The goal of the verbal protocol data collection was to obtain in-depth, detailed data from the subjects while they were interpreting and diagnosing a selection of computer-displayed chest x-rays. <p> Details can be found in <ref> (Rogers, 1992) </ref> with respect to noticing the critical secondary abnormality and producing a correct diagnosis). Almost all of the subjects noticed and labelled the abnormality in the lung immediately upon viewing the x-ray image.

Reference-contexts: The subjects who looked specifically at that landmark area saw the clue. Conclusion The results from this work have been incorporated into a model of visual interaction between perception and problem solving, described in <ref> (Rogers, 1995a) </ref>. This model has been further used as the basis for the design of a blackboard-based computer system called VIA (Visual Interaction Assistant), which incorporates the user, the image display and the program modules into a cooperative, problem solving system.

Reference-contexts: The design has been instantiated into a prototype system for diagnostic radiology called VIA-RAD, and was tested in a small observational study with radiologist subjects <ref> (Rogers, 1995b) </ref>. It is felt that the promising results of this work are due largely to the in-depth study of how practitioners actually perform their task.
