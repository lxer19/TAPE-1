Abstract: Spatial data mining, i.e., discovery of interesting, implicit knowledge in spatial databases, is an important task for understanding and use of spatial data- and knowledge-bases. In this paper, an efficient method for mining strong spatial association rules in geographic information databases is proposed and studied. A spatial association rule is a rule indicating certain association relationship among a set of spatial and possibly some nonspatial predicates. A strong rule indicates that the patterns in the rule have relatively frequent occurrences in the database and strong implication relationships. Several optimization techniques are explored, including a two-step spatial computation technique (approximate computation on large sets, and refined computations on small promising patterns), shared processing in the derivation of large predicates at multiple concept levels, etc. Our analysis shows that interesting association rules can be discovered efficiently in large spatial databases.

An association rule is a general form of dependency rule and is defined on transaction-based databases [1]. <p> In particular, the previous studies on mining association rules [1, 2, 13] are closely related to this study. An association rule is a general form of dependency rule and is defined on transaction-based databases <ref> [1] </ref>. It is in the form of "W ! B (c%)", explained as, "if a pattern W appears in a transaction, there is c% possibility (confidence) that the pattern B holds in the same transaction", where W and B are a set of attribute values. <p> For example, in a shopping transaction database one may find a rule like "butter ! bread (90%)", which means that 90% of customers who buy butter also purchase bread. Efficient algorithms for the discovery of such kind of rules in transaction-based databases have been studied <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. 3 Spatial Association Rules Generalization-based spatial data mining methods [14, 15] discover spatial and nonspatial relationships at a general concept level, where spatial objects are expressed as merged spatial regions [14] or clustered spatial points [15]. <p> Step 3 computes the support for each predicate in Coarse predicate DB, (and registers them in a predicate-support table), and filters out those entries whose support is below the minimum support threshold at the top level, i.e., minsup <ref> [1] </ref>. This filtering process results in a database which contains all large 1-predicates, which is called Large Coarse predicate DB. Notice that spatial association rules can also be generated at this resolution level, if desired. <p> Such a process of computing large k-predicate sets (called large k-itemsets in <ref> [1] </ref>) using previously computed (k 1)-predicate sets in a transaction-based database is studied in [1], and is called Algorithm Apriori. <p> Such a process of computing large k-predicate sets (called large k-itemsets in <ref> [1] </ref>) using previously computed (k 1)-predicate sets in a transaction-based database is studied in [1], and is called Algorithm Apriori. Notice that this k-predicate sets computation algorithm is fairly efficient one since it generates candidate k-predicate sets by full exploration of the combination of (k1)-predicate sets before testing the k-predicate pairs against the predicate database. <p> Thus the effort of testing such a 3-predicate against the predicate database can be saved. After finding large k-predicates, the set of association rules for each level l can be derived based on the minimum confidence at this level, minconf [l]. This is performed as follows <ref> [1] </ref>. For every large n-predicate A, if m-predicate B is not a subset of A, the rule "A ! B" is added into the result of the query if support (A ^ B)=support (A) minconf [l ]. <p> The syntax of the procedure is similar to C and Pascal. (1) procedure find large predicates and mine rules (DB); (2) for (l := 1; L <ref> [l; 1] </ref> 6= ; and l &lt; max level; l++) do begin (3) L [l; 1] := get large 1 predicate sets (DB; l); (4) for (k := 2; L [l; k 1] 6= ;; k++) do begin (5) P k := get candidate set (L [l; k 1]); (6) foreach <p> The syntax of the procedure is similar to C and Pascal.

Lines (4)-(11) computes the large k-predicate sets L [l; k] for all k &gt; 1 at the level l progressively, essentially using the Apriori algorithm [1], as we discuss above. <p> For each level l, line (3) computes the large 1-predicate sets and put into table L [l; 1]. Lines (4)-(11) computes the large k-predicate sets L [l; k] for all k &gt; 1 at the level l progressively, essentially using the Apriori algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>, as we discuss above. <p> Finally, Step 5 ensures to find the complete set of association rules at multiple concept levels based on the previous studies at mining multiple-level association rules in transaction-based databases <ref> [1, 13] </ref>. Therefore, the algorithm discovers the correct and complete set of association rules. Efficiency of the algorithm. We have the following theorem for the efficiency of the algorithm. Theorem 5. <p> These two optimization techniques are shared with the techniques for mining other (i.e., nonspatial) multiple-level association rules [13]. First, it uses the (k 1)-predicate sets to derive the candidate k-predicate sets at each level, which is similar to the apriori algorithm developed in <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Step 1 is accomplished by the execution of a spatial query. All the task-relevant objects are collected into one database: T ask relevant DB. Step 2 is accomplished by execution of some efficient spatial algorithms at a coarse resolution level. For example, R-trees <ref> [4] </ref> or fast MBR technique and plane-sweep algorithm [18] can be applied to extract the objects which are approximately close to each other, corresponding to computing g close to for the T ask relevant DB. The efficiency of the method is reasoned in the next subsection. <p> To avoid checking the predicates which will not be used later in the fine computation, approximate computation can be performed at a coarse resolution level. To accelerate this process, every object can be described using its MBR and coarse predicates can be derived using R-tree technique for spatial join <ref> [4] </ref> or plane sweep technique [18]. Furthermore, to computations faster one may use the data generalized and approximated data. For example, sinusoity of lines can be reduced, and small regions can be converted to points, etc. <p> Adding all costs together, we have the formula presented in the theorem. 2 Execution time of the above mining algorithm can be estimated using the results of spatial join computations based on real data <ref> [4, 5] </ref> and on our experience on mining multilevel association rules [13].

Reference-contexts: Secondly, the "generalized close to" (g close to) relationship between (large) towns and the other four classes of entities is computed at a relatively coarse resolution level using a less expensive spatial algorithm such as the MBR data structure and a plane sweeping algorithm [18], or R*-trees and other approximations <ref> [5] </ref>. The derived spatial predicates are collected in a "g close to" table (Table 1), which follows an extended relational model: each slot of the table may contain a set of entries. <p> Notice that spatial association rules can also be generated at this resolution level, if desired. Since this process is similar to the process of Step 5, the detailed processing of Step 3 is not presented here. Step 4 is accomplished by execution of some efficient spatial computation algorithms <ref> [5] </ref> at a fine resolution level on Large Coarse predicate DB obtained in Step 3.

Statistical methods handle well numerical data, contain a large number of algorithms, have a strong possibility of getting models of spatial phenomena, and allow optimizations. However, statistical analysis usually requires the assumptions regarding to statistical independence of spatially distributed data.

Reference-contexts: The spatial-dominant generalization first performs generalization on query-related spatial data. Data are generalized using spatial data hierarchies (such as geographic or administrative regions) provided by users/experts or hierarchical data structures (such as quad-trees [19] or R-trees <ref> [11] </ref>). The generalized spatial entities (such as the merged regions) cluster the related nonspatial data together. After generalization of non-spatial data, every region can be described at a high concept level by one or a set of predicates. Spatial hierarchies are not always given a priori.

Reference-contexts: Recently, there have been a lot of research activities on knowledge discovery in large databases (data mining) <ref> [9, 16] </ref>. <p> In the study of volcanos attributes recognized by humans like diameters and central peaks are not sufficient for the classification. Thus, eigenvalues of matrices representing images of possible volcanos were used as attributes for the classification algorithm. The studies on data mining in relational databases <ref> [1, 2, 12, 13, 16] </ref> are closely related to spatial data mining. In particular, the previous studies on mining association rules [1, 2, 13] are closely related to this study. An association rule is a general form of dependency rule and is defined on transaction-based databases [1].

Reference-contexts: at each level l into one table LL [l], and finally line (13) generates the spatial association rules at each concept level from the large predicate table LL [l]. 2 The generated rules may need to be examined by human experts or pass through some automatic rule quality testing program <ref> [17] </ref> in order to filter out some obvious or redundant rules and output only those fairly new and interesting ones to the users. 4.3 A Discussion of the Algorithm Algorithm 4.1 is an interesting and efficient algorithm for mining multiple-level strong spatial association rules in large spatial databases.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, the "generalized close to" (g close to) relationship between (large) towns and the other four classes of entities is computed at a relatively coarse resolution level using a less expensive spatial algorithm such as the MBR data structure and a plane sweeping algorithm <ref> [18] </ref>, or R*-trees and other approximations [5]. The derived spatial predicates are collected in a "g close to" table (Table 1), which follows an extended relational model: each slot of the table may contain a set of entries. <p> All the task-relevant objects are collected into one database: T ask relevant DB. Step 2 is accomplished by execution of some efficient spatial algorithms at a coarse resolution level. For example, R-trees [4] or fast MBR technique and plane-sweep algorithm <ref> [18] </ref> can be applied to extract the objects which are approximately close to each other, corresponding to computing g close to for the T ask relevant DB. The efficiency of the method is reasoned in the next subsection. <p> To accelerate this process, every object can be described using its MBR and coarse predicates can be derived using R-tree technique for spatial join [4] or plane sweep technique <ref> [18] </ref>. Furthermore, to computations faster one may use the data generalized and approximated data. For example, sinusoity of lines can be reduced, and small regions can be converted to points, etc. With a similar reasoning, Step 4 involves the computation of the spatial predicates at a refined level.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the map consists of a small number of regions with high level descriptions. The spatial-dominant generalization first performs generalization on query-related spatial data. Data are generalized using spatial data hierarchies (such as geographic or administrative regions) provided by users/experts or hierarchical data structures (such as quad-trees <ref> [19] </ref> or R-trees [11]). The generalized spatial entities (such as the merged regions) cluster the related nonspatial data together. After generalization of non-spatial data, every region can be described at a high concept level by one or a set of predicates. Spatial hierarchies are not always given a priori.
