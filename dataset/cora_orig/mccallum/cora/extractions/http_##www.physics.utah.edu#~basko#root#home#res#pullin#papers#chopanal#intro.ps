Abstract: We present analytic expressions that approximate the behavior of the spacetime of a collapsing spherically symmetric scalar field in the critical regime first discovered by Choptuik. We find that the critical region of space-time can usefully be divided into a "quiescent", an "oscillatory" and a moving "transition" regions. We find that in each region the critical solution can be well approximated by a flat spacetime scalar field solution. A qualitative nonlinear matching of the solutions across the edge yields the right order of magnitude for the oscillations of the discretely self-similar critical solution found by Choptuik.

Reference-contexts: Either a black hole forms or the scalar field energy eventually radiates away, leaving spacetime flat. By studying solutions very close to the critical case (formation of a black hole of vanishing mass) Choptuik <ref> [1] </ref> has found two very interesting phenomena, as yet not explained in any fundamental way: universality and echoing. Similarities to the Choptuik results have been found in other contexts. Abrahams and Evans [2] studied the collapse of axisymmetric vacuum gravitational fields. <p> This has been seen only in the work of Choptuik <ref> [1] </ref> and Abrahams and Evans [2] axially symmetric examples, in which the echoing occurred with a scaling factor 1:8 , rather than 30 as in Choptuik's spherically symmetric results. Very recently Gundlach [10], with an independent numerical approach, has confirmed that the echoing is an exact feature of the solution.

Reference-contexts: Similarities to the Choptuik results have been found in other contexts. Abrahams and Evans [2] studied the collapse of axisymmetric vacuum gravitational fields. Coleman and Evans <ref> [3] </ref> have studied the collapse of spherically symmetric radiative fluids, and several authors [4-6] studied the collapse of spherically symmetric complex scalar fields. "Universality" refers to the fact that the dependence of the mass of the final hole on a parameter of the initial data, appears to have a universal power-law <p> Very recently Gundlach [10], with an independent numerical approach, has confirmed that the echoing is an exact feature of the solution.

It is widely suspected that the echoing behavior has an origin related to self-similarity, but a detailed understanding is still lacking.
