Title: Electronic Lottery Tickets as Micropayments  
Author: Ronald L. Rivest 
Affiliation: MIT Lab for Computer Science (RSA Security Dynamics)  
Abstract: We present a new micropayment scheme based on the use of "electronic lottery tickets." This scheme is exceptionally efficient since the bank handles only winning tickets, instead of handling each micro payment.

Reference-contexts: Or, the vendor could verify on-line the issuer's good standing with the payer when the vendor receives his first electronic lottery ticket from an issuer, and thereafter just deposit the winners. (This is reminiscent of the techniques of Jarecki and Odlyzko <ref> [4] </ref> for "probabilistic polling".) There is also some risk to the user that he might be issuing too many winning tickets, and so run up a large bill for his "micropayments." As noted above, the chance of this happening are small, and the users of electronic lottery tickets should be aware

Reference-contexts: Since the issuer may create as many lottery tickets as he wishes, it is appropriate (and necessary) that he take on the obligation of paying off all winning tickets. My favorite version of this scheme is based on the micropayment scheme PayWord by Adi Shamir and myself <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Making payments by probabilistic methods with the correct expected value is the subject matter of two patents [7, 8] by Michael Rossides, and is discussed in a note in the Economist [3]. Most recently, David Wheeler <ref> [11] </ref> has also proposed "transactions using bets." With respect to this prior art, the present note makes contributions by emphasizing the utility of probabilistic payments in the micropayment arena, by carefully distinguishing the roles of issuer and payer, and by extending the PayWord mechanism to enable probabilistic payments.
