Title: Operational Event Timing Constraints in Ptolemy  
Author: Ross Ortega 
Date: October 24, 1992  
Abstract: Event-driven simulators are an effective way to behaviorally describe a system. Timing constraints are also an important component of a system description. Ptolemy, a powerful graphical simulation framework, provides an event-driven environment. OESIM, a text-based event-driven simulator, provides support for timing constraints. This paper describes a new Ptolemy environment, based on the existing event-driven one, which includes the timing constraint semantics of OESIM.
