Abstract: Central to any information mediator that accesses Web-based information sources is a set of wrappers that extract relevant data from Web pages. We introduce stalker, a wrapper-induction algorithm that generates extraction rules for semistructured, Web-based information sources. stalker generates extraction rules that are expressed as simple landmark grammars, which are a class of finite automata that is more expressive than the existing extraction languages. Based on just a few training examples, stalker learns extraction rules for sources that can not be wrapped by existing techniques.

Reference-contexts: While Kushmerick's approach dramatically reduces the time required to wrap a source, his extraction language is significantly less expressive than the ones provided by the manual approaches. Finally, in <ref> (Ashish & Knoblock 1997) </ref>, the authors made a compromise between the manual and the inductive approaches by introducing an expert system that uses a fixed set of heuristics of the type "look for bold or italicized strings".

Reference-contexts: The mediators above rely on wrappers that can extract information from semistructured Web pages (a page is semistructured if the desired information can be located using a concise, formal grammar). Some mediators, such as tsimmis (Chawathe et al. 1994) and araneus <ref> (Atzeni, Mecca, & Merialdo 1997) </ref> depend on humans to create the grammar rules required to extract information from a page.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction With the expansion of the Web, computer users gained access to a large variety of comprehensive information repositories. However, the Web is based on a browsing paradigm that makes it difficult to retrieve and integrate data from multiple sources. The most recent generation of information mediators (e.g., Ari-adne <ref> (Knoblock et al. 1998) </ref>, tsimmis (Chawathe et al. 1994), or Internet Softbots (Doorenbos, Etzioni, & Weld 1997)) address this problem by enabling information from pre-specified sets of Web sites to be accessed via database-like queries. <p> Second, even for hard sources like the Address Finder and the Quote Server, stalker requires extremely few training cases (5 and 4, respectively). 8 Related Work With the recently increasing interest in accessing Web-based information sources, a significant number of research projects deal with the information extraction problem: Ariadne <ref> (Knoblock et al. 1998) </ref>, wien (Kushmerick 1997), tsimmis (Chawathe et al. 1994), araneus (Atzeni & Mecca 1997) and Knowledge Broker (Chidlovskii, Borghoff, & Chevalier 1997). All these research efforts rely on one of the following wrapper-generation techniques: manual, expert system based, or inductive.

Reference-contexts: The first four sources were taken from Kushmerick's thesis, for purposes of comparison. These four sources were relatively hard for the wien system <ref> (Kushmerick 1997) </ref>. Specifically, the Address Finder and the Quote Server were beyond wien's wrapping capabilities, while Okra and BigBook required the largest number of training cases. <p> sources like the Address Finder and the Quote Server, stalker requires extremely few training cases (5 and 4, respectively). 8 Related Work With the recently increasing interest in accessing Web-based information sources, a significant number of research projects deal with the information extraction problem: Ariadne (Knoblock et al. 1998), wien <ref> (Kushmerick 1997) </ref>, tsimmis (Chawathe et al. 1994), araneus (Atzeni & Mecca 1997) and Knowledge Broker (Chidlovskii, Borghoff, & Chevalier 1997). All these research efforts rely on one of the following wrapper-generation techniques: manual, expert system based, or inductive. <p> Even though such systems offer fairly expressive extraction languages, the manual wrapper generation is a tedious, time consuming task that requires a high level of expertise; furthermore, the rules have to be rewritten whenever the sources suffer format changes. The wrapper induction techniques used by wien <ref> (Kushmerick 1997) </ref> are better fit to frequent format changes because they rely on learning techniques to generate the extraction rules. While Kushmerick's approach dramatically reduces the time required to wrap a source, his extraction language is significantly less expressive than the ones provided by the manual approaches.
