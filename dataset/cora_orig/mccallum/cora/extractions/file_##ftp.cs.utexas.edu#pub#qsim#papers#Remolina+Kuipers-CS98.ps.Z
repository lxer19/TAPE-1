Title: Towards a formalization of the Spatial Semantic Hierarchy

Abstract: The Spatial Semantic Hierarchy (SSH) comprises a set of distinct representations of space, each with its own ontology, each with its own mathematical foundation, and each abstracted from the levels below it. In particular, the SSH topological level is abstracted from the SSH causal level. The method used to abstract the SSH topological level has usually been defined as an abduction task, described in procedural terms according to the current implementation of the SSH. In this paper we define the circumscriptive theories associated with the SSH causal and topological levels. These theories are used to formalize the SSH abduction task and prove our implementation correct. Moreover, these theories show how topological information is used to dictate spatial distinctions that cannot be derived from causal information alone.

Reference-contexts: Each level of the hierarchy has its own ontology (the set of objects and relations it uses for describing the world) and its own set of inference and problem-solving methods. The objects, relations, and assumptions required by each level are provided by those below it. 1 This presentation follows <ref> [3] </ref> 2 In large-scale space the structure of the environment is revealed by integrating local observations over time, rather than being perceived from a single vantage point The SSH abstracts the structure of an agent's spatial knowledge in a way that is relatively independent of its sensorimotor apparatus and the environment
