Abstract: We describe the problem of automated steering using computer vision, focusing the analysis and design on appropriate lateral controllers. We investigate various static feedback strategies where the measurements obtained from vision, namely offset from the centerline at some lookahead distance and the angle between the road tangent and the orientation of the vehicle at some lookahead distance, are directly used for control. Within this setting we explore the role of lookahead, its relation to the vision processing delay, the longitudinal velocity and road geometry. Results from ongoing experiments with our autonomous vehicle system are presented along with simulation results.

Reference-contexts: The delay element adds an additional phase lag over the whole range of frequencies having a clear destabilizing effect on the overall system and limiting the system's bandwidth. More detailed analysis can be found in [6], <ref> [1] </ref>. Controller Design. Analysis reveals that up to 15 m/s the lookahead one can guarantee satisfactory damping of the closed loop poles of V 1 (s) and compensate for the delay using simple unity feedback control with proportional gain in the forward loop.
