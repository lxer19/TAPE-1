Abstract: Image denoising and segmentation are fundamental problems in the field of image processing and computer vision with numerous applications. We propose a partial differential equation (PDE) based smoothing and segmentation framework wherein the image data are smoothed via an evolution equation that is controlled by a vector field describing a viscous fluid flow. Image segmentation in this framework is defined by locations in the image where the fluid velocity is a local maximum. The nonlinear image smoothing is selectively achieved to preserve edges in the image. The novelty of this approach lies in the fact that the selective term is derived from a nonlinearly regularized image gradient field unlike most earlier techniques which either used a constant (with respect to time) selective term or a time varying nonlinearly smoothed scalar valued term. Implementation results on synthetic and real images are presented to depict the performance of the technique in comparison to methods recently reported in literature.

Reference-contexts: In [12], Perona and Ma-lik developed an anisotropic diffusion scheme for image smoothing and segmentation. The basic idea of this nonlinear smoothing scheme was to smooth the image while preserving the edges in it. Segmentation was achieved by finding edges in this smoothed image. Alvarez et al., <ref> [1] </ref> recognized the ill-posedness of the Perona-Malik diffusion and proposed modifications to overcome the same. Since then, several nonlinear diffusion methods have been developed and a good account of these can be found in [13, 16]. <p> Shah [13] demonstrated that all the existing curve evolution and anisotropic diffusion schemes reported in literature can be viewed as special cases of his method.

Chen et. al., proved the existence, uniqueness and stability of their solution. In this paper, we will present a new image denoising and segmentation approach which is based on a coupled system of PDEs. <p> Also, we do not minimize the number of discontinuities in the image as was done in Shah's work.

Reference-contexts: Segmentation was achieved by finding edges in this smoothed image. Alvarez et al., [1] recognized the ill-posedness of the Perona-Malik diffusion and proposed modifications to overcome the same. Since then, several nonlinear diffusion methods have been developed and a good account of these can be found in <ref> [13, 16] </ref>. Image segmentation can also be achieved by approaches based on curve evolution [2, 10, 3, 7, 6]. However, they do not simultaneously perform image smoothing. <p> novelty of this approach lies in the fact that the selective term is derived from a non-linearly regularized image gradient field unlike most earlier techniques which either used a constant (with respect to time) [10, 3, 7, 14, 6] selective term or a time varying nonlinearly smoothed scalar valued term <ref> [12, 1, 13, 16] </ref>. In tis paper, ~ T the gradient field is smoothed nonlinearly using a viscous fluid flow model.
