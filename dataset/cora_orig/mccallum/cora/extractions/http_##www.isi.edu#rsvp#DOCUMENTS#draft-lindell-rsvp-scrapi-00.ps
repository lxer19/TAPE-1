Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction This document describes SCRAPI, a simple ``Bare Bones'' API for RSVP <ref> [1] </ref>. The goal of this API is produce an interface which simplifies the augmentation of applications with RSVP support. The main features of SCRAPI are: Allow the addition of RSVP support to applications by adding a few lines of code.

Reference-contexts: Provide a portable interface which can be used with any vendor's RAPI implementation. Avoid the introduction of RSVP specific data types and definitions. Support IPv4 and IPv6 in a transparent manner. SCRAPI is layered on top of RAPI <ref> [2] </ref>, an existing RSVP API, to provide portability across vendor implementations. Currently, SCRAPI has been tested only with the ISI implementation of RAPI.

Reference-contexts: Lindell Expiration: February 1999 [Page 2] INTERNET-DRAFT SCRAPI v.1 July 1998 2. Functional Description Applications which use SCRAPI get a simplied service model. The average bandwidth specified by the sender is currently translated into the integrated services controlled load [4] or guaranteed service <ref> [3] </ref> with the given average bandwidth. The peak bandwidth and token bucket depth are set to twice the average bandwidth. Minimum policed unit and maximum packet size are set to 64 bytes and the largest MTU of all IP interfaces on the host.
