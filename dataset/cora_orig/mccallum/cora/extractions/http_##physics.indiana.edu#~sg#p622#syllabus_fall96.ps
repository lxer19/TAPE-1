Abstract: Prerequisites You should have a sound knowledge of electrodynamics, classical mechanics and quantum mechanics at the graduate level. You should also be familiar with special relativity. Classical mechanics will be briefly reviewed. Familiarity with the Dirac equation is not assumed. Description I hope that you will find studying quantum field theory as fascinating as I do. If it were not such a fascination, I would not be an elementary particle physicist today. Quantum Field Theory has been under development since the early days of quantum mechanics, and even today is not a closed subject. It's main application, the theory of elementary particle physics is certainly a vibrant field and a thorough knowledge of field theory is important for those who wish to contribute to its future. Field theoretical and diagramatic techniques are also of great importance in the modern theory of critical phenomena and in many-body physics.

Reference: <author> N. N. Bogoliubov and D. V. Shirkov, </author> <title> Introduction to the Theory of Quantized Fields. This book was published in the late 1950's. It has an excellent treatment of basic QFT in the order we are going to start. The last three chapters treat functional integration, renormalization group and dispersion relations. The first two are still with us, but would probably be presented in a somewhat different way. The last topic was hot at the time, but fell into disuse as more modern field theoretic techniques came to the fore with the ascendancy of gauge theories. </title>
Reference: <author> C. Itzykson and J.-M. Zuber, </author> <title> Quantum Field Theory. It is rather encyclopedic, so it is not the shortest, most direct root to a basic understanding of QFT. A solid reference work for additional and deeper material. </title>
Reference: <author> P. Ramond, </author> <title> Field Theory|A Modern Primer. This book launches quickly into symmetry considerations, construction of suitable Lagrangians and the path integration. It really is quite nice. (I sure wish I could find my copy). So, if you just can't wait to get to path integration, pick up this book and start reading it. </title>
Reference: <author> L. Ryder, </author> <title> Quantum Field Theory. Another book that presents field theory from the path integral viewpoint. </title>
Reference: <author> S. Weinberg, </author> <title> The Quantum Theory of Fields, is a new book by Nobel Laureate noted for earlier text on gravitation and cosmology as well as popular works. First volume of three. Although I don't really know this book, it is sure to show field theory from a unique viewpoint. </title>
Reference: <author> B. de Wit, and J. Smith, </author> <title> Field theory in particle physics. This book takes the pragmatic approach. After a brief introduction to mechanics, the approach is a diagramatic one. By chapter two the reader is introduced to propagators and Feynman rules. The calculations of cross sections and decays continue from there. </title>
Reference: <author> I. J. R. Aitchison and A. J. G. Hey, </author> <title> Gauge Theories in Particle Physics. Again, this book is designed to get you calculating cross sections as soon as possible. </title>
Reference: <author> T. D. Lee, </author> <title> Particle Physics and Introduction to Field Theory. After a quick introduction to field theory, this book discusses a wide variety of topics in elementary particle physics. You will find additional references in Itzykson and Zuber, page xxi. Please explore as your time and taste dictate. </title>
