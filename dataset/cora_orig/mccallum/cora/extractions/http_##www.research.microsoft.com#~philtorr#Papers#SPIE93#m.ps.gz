Title: Outlier Detection and Motion Segmentation

Abstract: We present a new method for solving the problem of motion segmentation, identifying the objects within an image moving independently of the background. We utilise the fact that two views of a static 3D point set are linked by a 3 fi 3 Fundamental Matrix [F]. The Fundamental Matrix contains all the information on structure and motion from a given set of point correspondences and is derived by a least squares method under the assumption that the majority of the image is undergoing a rigid motion. Least squares is the most commonly used method of parameter estimation in computer vision algorithms. However the estimated parameters from a least squares fit can be corrupted beyond recognition in the presence of gross errors or outliers which plague any data from real imagery. Features with a motion independent of the background are those statistically inconsistent from the calculated value of [F]. Well founded methods for detecting these outlying points are described.

Reference-contexts: In robotic vision, motion segmentation turns out to be a most demanding problem in classification. One approach to motion segmentation is to describe the motion field locally, recovering first and higher order derivatives of the motion field within small image patches to construct a Taylor series expansion. Adiv <ref> [1] </ref> and Waxman and Duncan [20] used this approach, making second order approximations to the flow field. Segmentation progressed by merging adjacent patches having similar expansions. Clearly, in order to determine the derivatives locally, such methods require dense and highly accurate determination of motion.

Reference-contexts: A common practice is to search for outliers using the raw residuals. However, the use of these on their own can be misleading. Much work has been done already on detecting outliers given the case of non-orthogonal regression (reviewed in <ref> [2] </ref>), where we choose to regress against a given, dependent, variable. Unfortunately there is in this method a tacit assumption that all the error is concentrated in the dependent variable and furthermore that the dependent variable has a non-zero coefficient.

Reference-contexts: Several measures of influence exist in the literature. They differ in the particular regression result on which the effect of the deletion is measured, and the standardization used to make them comparable over observations. A diagnostic that is typical of those currently in use is Cook's D <ref> [3] </ref>, which measures the effect on the solution of the deletion of a given datum. Unfortunately, this method was derived for standard regression when there is error only in the measurement of the dependent variable and so is not applicable to many categories of problem.

Reference-contexts: A feature detector and matcher is applied to two images in order to get a set of correspondences.

The images are 128 fi 100 taken from an infra-red camera. The top image shows the corners detected by the corner detector described in <ref> [4] </ref>, the matching procedure worked by using cross correlation in a square window. The middle image shows the data consistent with the fit with = 0:5, the bottom image shows the rejected outliers. 8 Robust Statistics One approach to outlier identification are the regression diagnostics we have already described. <p> The image is 128 fi 128. The corners were found by the corner detector described in <ref> [4] </ref>, the matching procedure worked by using cross correlation in a square window.

The algorithm randomly selects the minimum number of data to instantiate a model and estimate a set of parameters. The number of data points in the whole set that is within a threshold of the model is determined.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively the Fundamental matrix may be thought of as a quadric surface in the space defined by (x; y; x 0 ; y 0 ), thus we can apply a modification of Sampson's <ref> [13] </ref> iterative conic fitting method to find [F] and remove outliers.

Reference-contexts: Little work has been done on outlier detection for orthogonal regression, with the exception of <ref> [15] </ref>. In this paper we outline two methodologies for outlier detection. In sections 2-5 we describe an extension of previous outlier diagnostics to the realm of orthogonal regression. The method works by assessing the amount of influence that the deletion of each point would have on the final solution.

Reference-contexts: Again, however, this is done by comparison of field descriptions computed in small patches in the image: the use of too large patches would result in poor localization of motion boundaries.

Reference-contexts: We would like to choose a norm to make T i both scaleless and invariant to non-singular transformation of the data.

We ran the experiment on 8 dimensional data randomly generated so as to lie on a random hyperplane within a hypercube centred at the origin, side 100. The data was perturbed by Gaussian noise standard deviation 1:0.
