Abstract: For various polynomial-time reducibilities r, this paper asks whether being r-reducible to a sets, this paper shows that extending their result to the 2-truth-table case would provide a proof that P 6= NP. Additionally, this paper studies the relative power of different notions of reducibility, and proves sparse set is a broader notion than being r-equivalent to a sparse set.

Reference-contexts: Let E denote S k0 DTIME [2 kn ], and let NE denote S k0 NTIME [2 kn ]. It is shown in <ref> [3] </ref> that the following are equivalent: 1. Every NE predicate is E-solvable. 2.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, equivalence has been used by Balcazar and Book to characterize completely a natural subset of R p T (SPARSE), namely the sets with self-producible circuits <ref> [4] </ref>. 1 Though formal definitions will be given in Section 2, it is useful to introduce some notation here.

Reference-contexts: R T (SPARSE) is indeed quite robust; in addition to its characterization in terms of small circuits, R p T (SPARSE) is easily noted equivalent to R p T (TALLY), R p tt (TALLY), and R tt (SPARSE) (see <ref> [6] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: class of sets that polynomial-time Turing reduce to sparse sets. 1 The sense in which R p T (SPARSE) sets are of small information con tent can be crisply formalized: R p T (SPARSE) is precisely the class|more commonly referred to as P/poly|of sets having polynomial-sized (nonuniform) circuits (Meyer, see <ref> [7] </ref>). R T (SPARSE) has been intensely studied, both in terms of the question "NP R T (SPARSE)?" [19,16,10,18], and in terms of the robustness of R p T (SPARSE).

Reference-contexts: We note that the above equivalence can be extended to include classes of the form R btt (TALLY), and, equivalently, R p m (TALLY). The following result, alluded to in [2], was observed independently by Fu Bin <ref> [8] </ref>. Theorem 3.3.

Reference-contexts: Having defined the above types of reductions, we can now speak of the class of sets reducible or equivalent to a certain class of sets via a certain type of reduction. Such notions were first investigated in a systematic way by Book and Ko <ref> [9] </ref> and Tang and Book [31]. We modify their nomenclature to allow a uniform notation for all reduction types. Definition 2.2. 1. Let C be a class of sets and let t r be a reducibility. We define R t r (C) = fA fi C and A t 2.

Reference-contexts: 5tt S 0 , and Here, DP, difference polynomial time, is the class of sets|first studied by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [27]|that can be represented as the difference of two NP sets; DP sets are crucial to the normal-form structure of the boolean hierarchy [11] and appear naturally in many settings <ref> [12] </ref>. Informally, we may describe Theorem 4.7 as stating that all sets 2-truth-table reducible to sparse sets are DP-equivalent to sparse sets. We omit the proof, as it is based on a detailed analysis similar to that of Theorem 4.3.

Reference-contexts: We show that the Gavalda-Watanabe result cannot be extended to the 2-truth-table case without providing a proof that P 6= NP.

However, Theorem 4.1 establishes, for the case of bounded truth-table reductions, a wide separation between reducibility and equivalence. Theorem 4.1. <p> Corollary 4.2. For every k 2, it holds that R p ktt (SPARSE) 6= E p ktt (SPARSE). 4.2. Upper Bounds Corollary 4.2 establishes that, for all k 2, R p ktt (SPARSE) 6= E p ktt (SPARSE). Gavalda and Watanabe <ref> [13] </ref> have proven that, for any unbounded polynomial-time com putable function f (n), R p f (n)tt (SPARSE) 6 E p T (SPARSE). <p> Gavalda and Watanabe <ref> [13] </ref> show that not all sets Turing reducible to sparse sets are even strong-nondeterministic equivalent to sparse sets. This is essentially an NP coNP lower bound on the strength of the reduction needed to achieve equivalence.

Reference-contexts: An f (n)-tt reduction is a truth-table reduction that, on inputs of size n, generates at most f (n) queries. See Section 2 for full definitions of these and other notions. 3 classes. Ko <ref> [20, p. 65] </ref> conjectures that for each k &gt; 0 it holds that R p ktt (SPARSE) 6 R dtt (SPARSE). We refute this conjecture by proving the following result. Theorem E R p btt (SPARSE) R p dtt (SPARSE). <p> In particular, if P = NP then all sets 2-truth-table reducible to sparse sets are truth-table equivalent to sparse sets. Finally, we addressed the power of disjunctive and conjunctive reductions to sparse sets. Refuting a conjecture of Ko <ref> [20] </ref>, we proved that all sets bounded truth-table reducible to sparse sets are indeed disjunctive truth-table reducible to sparse sets.

Reference-contexts: Theorem E R p btt (SPARSE) R p dtt (SPARSE). This may be interpreted as saying that disjunctive truth-table reductions to sparse sets are surprisingly powerful. We prove related results showing that the power of conjunctive truth-table and many-one reductions, in the nondeterministic model of Ladner, Lynch, and Selman <ref> [22] </ref>, is also substantial. Theorem F 1. R NP m (SPARSE) = R NP btt (SPARSE). 2. R NP ctt (SPARSE) = R NP T (SPARSE). The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews notations and definitions. <p> freely write f (y 1 ; :::) as a shorthand for f (hy 1 ; : : :i). 4 We adopt the standard notions of reducibility, as introduced by Ladner, Lynch, and Selman. (We make slight alterations in the definitions; these alterations do not effect the reductions defined.) Definition 2.1. <ref> [22] </ref> 1. A tt-condition is a finite string of the form hy 1 ; y 2 ; : : :i, where each y i is a member of fl . 2. A tt-condition generator is a recursive mapping from fl into the set of tt-conditions. 3. <p> Theorem 4.3. If P = NP then R p 2tt (SPARSE) E p tt (SPARSE). Proof: Let L p 2tt S, S sparse, via truth-table generator g and evaluator e <ref> [22] </ref>. Under our hypothesis that P = NP, we construct a sparse set b S such that L p b S. Let ft i fi i 16g represent the sixteen truth-tables of arity two. <p> To establish the theorem, we have only to show that there is another sparse set A to which L is p dtt reducible. Since f witnesses that L p without loss of generality (see <ref> [22] </ref>), we may assume the following: For every x 2 fl , (a) f (x) is of the form b 11 b 1k $ $b m1 b mk $w 1 $ $w k , where (1) $ is a new symbol not in f0; 1; #g, (2) for every i; 1 <p> Therefore, L 2 R p dtt (SPARSE), and this proves the theorem. Next we consider the classes of sets that are reducible to sparse sets via polynomial-time nondeterministic Turing machines. The following definitions are due to Ladner, Lynch, and Selman. Definition 5.3. <ref> [22] </ref> (1) A set A is polynomial-time nondeterministic many-one reducible to a set B (denoted A NP m B) if there exists a polynomial-time nondeterministic Turing machine M such that for every x 2 fl , (1A) for each computation path of M on x, M outputs some string, and (1B) <p> In particular, the following theorem should be contrasted with the fact that there are classes C, and indeed single sets, such that R NP btt (C) and R NP m (C) differ <ref> [22] </ref>. 25 Theorem 5.5. R NP m (SPARSE) = R NP btt (SPARSE). Proof To prove this, we will show that R NP btt (SPARSE) R NP dtt (SPARSE). <p> R NP m (SPARSE) = R NP btt (SPARSE). Proof To prove this, we will show that R NP btt (SPARSE) R NP dtt (SPARSE). Ladner, Lynch, and Selman <ref> [22, Theorem 4.1, Part (iii)] </ref> have shown that for every pair of sets A and B, it holds that A NP m B if and only if A NP dtt B. It follows immediately that R NP dtt (SPARSE) R NP m (SPARSE).
