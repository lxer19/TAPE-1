Abstract: In this paper a new intelligent control architecture for autonomous multi-robot systems is presented. Furthermore, the paper deals with task description, task distribution, task allocation and coordination of the system components. The main advantage of the new control architecture is the distributed execution of tasks or subtasks by components of the multi-robot system. The components are able to build teams dynamically thereby avoiding the bottle neck problem of the information flow in centralized controlled architectures. To achieve to distributed organized control architectures, the detailed investigation of communication and cooperation between components is imperative. The described intelligent control architecture is to replace the former control architecture of the autonomous robot KAMRO.

Reference-contexts: They are necessary to intelligently carry out tasks in the area of transportation, manufacturing, and maintenance Examples are automatically guided transport systems containing many vehicles, complex flexible manufacturing cells, or eventually mobile manipulator systems, that could be used for autonomous service applications in an industrial setting <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. The main problem is often the design of the intelligent control structure (ICS) for such complex systems, and also for system components if the overall system consists of several separate systems.

Reference-contexts: Distributed action selection: Available information is processed by several decision making components, which communicate and negotiate to come to a decision. Afterwards the information is transformed locally and globally into an action for the agent's body (Blackboard <ref> [12] </ref>, White board [13]) Decentralized action selection: The available information is processed independently by several decision making components and transformed locally in their own action decision for the agent's body (Motor schema [14]).

From an execution-oriented point of view, the presented taxonomy not only allows the classification of already described ICS for planning and control. It also describes multi-agent systems in a similar way as single systems. 3.

Reference-contexts: The robot receives assembly tasks from a cell controller, which are represented by assembly precedence graphs. Afterwards, the robot travels to a workstation, searches for the necessary assembly parts with its camera system and performs the assembly autonomously. The used control architecture FATE <ref> [15] </ref> consists of a blackboard planning level that generates situation-dependent manipulatorspecific elementary operations. The real-time robot control system RT-RCS executes the elementary operations. The real-time controller is able to control the manipulators independently or in a closed kinematic chain.
