Abstract: Let U be a continuous representation of a Lie group G on a Banach space X and a 1 ; : : : ; a d 0 an algebraic basis of the Lie algebra g of G, i.e., the a 1 ; : : : ; a d 0 together with their multi-commutators span g. Let A i = dU (a i ) denote the infinitesimal generator of the continuous one-parameter group t 7! U (exp(ta i )) and set A ff = A i 1 : : : A i n where ff = (i 1 ; : : : ; i n ) with i j 2 f1; : : : ; d 0 g. We analyze properties of m-th order differential operators If L denotes the left regular representation of G in L 2 (G) then dL(C) satisfies a Garding inequality on L 2 (G) if and only if the closure of each dU (C) generates a holomorphic semigroup S on X , the action of S z is determined by a smooth, representation independent, kernel K z which, together with its derivatives A ff K z , satisfies m-th order Gaussian bounds and, if U is unitary, S is quasi-contractive, in an open representation independent subsector of the sector of holomorphy. Alternatively, dL(C) satisfies a Garding inequality on L 2 (G) if, and only if, the closure of dL(C) generates a holomorphic, quasi-contractive, semigroup satisfying bounds kA i S t k 2!2 c t 1=m e !t for all t &gt; 0 and i 2 f1; : : : ; d 0 g. These results extend to operators for which the directions a 1 ; : : : ; a d 0 are given different weights. The unweighted Garding inequality is a stability condition on the the principal part, i.e., the highest order part, of dL(C) but in the weighted case the condition is on the part of dL(C) with the highest weighted order. dU (C) =

Reference-contexts: In order to give a more precise description of our results it is necessary to introduce more detailed notation and definitions. Generally we adopt the notation of [Rob2] with the modifications used in [ElR3] and <ref> [AER] </ref>. Let G be a d-dimensional connected Lie group with Lie algebra g and (X ; G; U ) a strongly, or weakly fl , continuous representation of G on the Banach space X by bounded operators g 7! U (g). <p> One can use this interpolation to establish that each G-weighted subcoercive form is automatically a G 0 -weighted subcoercive form. Then the implication I)IV in Theorem 1.1 is proved by first applying the results of <ref> [AER] </ref> to C on the homogeneous group G 0 to obtain the corresponding implication for G 0 and subsequently lifting the result to G by parametrix arguments. The latter reasoning makes essential use of the results of Helffer and Nourrigat [HeN] for homogeneous groups. The proof of IV)III is straightforward. <p> The Helffer-Nourrigat theorem, [HeN], states that a homogeneous form P is a positive Rockland form if, and only if, the operator dL (P )j C 1 c (G) is hypoelliptic. A Rockland form P is called a positive Rockland form if dL (P ) is symmetric and positive (see <ref> [AER] </ref>). In that case the operator dL (P ) is referred to as a positive Rockland operator. Let P be a positive Rockland form of order m. <p> These operators have been studied in [FoS] [Heb1] [DzH] [Dzi] [DHZ] <ref> [AER] </ref> and [ElR6]. The definition of G-subcoercivity is local insofar the Garding inequality (12) is only required for ' supported in some arbitrarily small neighbourhood V of the identity. <p> Hence it suffices to prove that 1 0 ) 4 0 and 5 ) 3, because 2 0 ) 4 0 follows from 1 0 ) 4 0 . First we prove 5 ) 3. Let P 0 be the form defined in (13). It was established in <ref> [AER] </ref>, Proposition 2.1, that dL (P 0 ) is a positive self-adjoint operator and there exists a c &gt; 0 such that k'k 0 for all ' 2 D (dL (P 0 )) = L 0 2;m . <p> The homogeneous structure of the Lie algebra g is exploited through scaling arguments. The arguments are an amalga mation of methods used in [HeN] [ElR3] and <ref> [AER] </ref>. As a preliminary we observe that C &gt; 0. Set o = supf j Im (dL G (P )'; ')j=(N 0 2;m=2 (')) 2 : ' 2 L 2;1 (G); ' 6= 0g : Then o &lt; 1 by (16) and C arctan (o 1 ) &gt; 0. <p> V. If n 2 N and k 2 h0; nmi then there exists a c &gt; 0 such that k'k 0 2;nm + c " k k'k 2 2;nm . Proof This follows from the Helffer-Nourrigat theory and scaling. See also <ref> [AER] </ref> Propo sition 2.1. Proposition 5.4 The operator H = dL (C) generates a holomorphic semigroup S on L 2 (G), with a holomorphy sector containing the sector fl ( C ), which satisfies kS z k 2!2 1 for all z 2 fl ( C ). <p> Proof The proof is almost the same as the proofs of Proposition 2.2 and Corollary 2.3 in <ref> [AER] </ref>, so we only indicate the one significant difference. <p> proof of Proposition 2.2, where the spectral theorem was used to establish for all n 2 N the existence of a c 1 &gt; 0 such that i 2;nm c 1 uniformly for all 2 fl (=2 + C ") with jj = 1 for the self-adjoint operator H in <ref> [AER] </ref>. Since the present operator H is not necessarily symmetric we have to give a new proof of (22), uniformly for 2 fl (=2 + C ") with jj = 1. Let n 2 N. <p> Now one can proceed as in <ref> [AER] </ref>. We omit the details. Define K t = 0 for t 0. Then (t; g) 7! K t (g) is a C 1 -function on (R fi G)nf (0; e)g and the Gaussian bounds imply that this function is a distribution on R fi G. <p> Proposition 5.6 One has ((@ t + H)K t )(g) = ffi (t) ffi (g) as distributions. Proof It follows from <ref> [AER] </ref> that ((@ t + H)K t )(g) = 0 pointwise if (t; g) 6= (0; e). The fact that (t; g) 7! K t (g) is a fundamental solution of the operator @ t + H then follows as in Folland [Fol1] Proposition 3.3. <p> But ( f K t ) t&gt;0 is a bounded approximation of the identity (cf. the proof of Lemma 3.3 in <ref> [AER] </ref>) and hence lim U (K t )x = lim Z da oe (a) f K t (exp 0 (a)) ^O (a) U (exp (a))x = x : Therefore lim t#0 S t x = x strongly if U is strongly continuous and weakly fl if U is weakly fl continuous. <p> Proof Since the kernel K is a convolution semigroup it now follows that (S t ) t&gt;0 = (U (K t )) t&gt;0 is a continuous semigroup. One then deduces as in Theorem 3.4 of <ref> [AER] </ref> that H is the generator and S is holomorphic, with the holomorphy sector containing at least fl ( C;G 0 ).

Reference-contexts: Subsequently, Robinson [Rob1] established that K, together with its derivatives, satisfies Gaussian bounds of the appropriate order. Moreover, Bratteli, Good-man, Jorgensen and Robinson <ref> [BGJR] </ref> proved that in each unitary representation S is quasi-contractive and H satisfies a Garding inequality, i.e., a coercivity condition. (All these results are described at length in [Rob2].) Finally a limiting argument of Folland [Fol2] shows that the Garding inequality for H in the left regular representation of G on <p> Proof The proofs of Statements I, II and IV are as in the proof of Theorem 5.8 in [ElR5] and the proof of Statement V is similar to the proof in <ref> [BGJR] </ref>. Since Statement III is stronger than Statement III in [ElR5] we give a new proof.

Reference-contexts: Next we prove the Gaussian estimates on K. We argue as in the appendix of <ref> [BrR] </ref> and in Section 4 of [ElR7]. The definition of K (n) makes sense as an L ae 1 -function and K (n) continuous for all t &gt; 0 and n 2 N 0 .

Since X 0 lw is continuously embedded in (X ; X 0 nm ) lw=(nm);1;K , by the proof of Proposition 5.1 in [ElR5], Statement III follows from Corollary 8.3.III and Statement I as in [ElR2] Proposition 4.3. Statement IV is an easy consequence of Statement III. <p> We will show that Condition III of Theorem 10.1 is valid using a scaling argument and a refinement of the proof of Lemma 5.1. We may assume that p = 2 and fl &lt; 1 by an application of the reiteration theorem <ref> [BuB] </ref> Proposition 3.2.18. Moreover, we may assume that G = G 0 .

Reference-contexts: Then by [Kat], Theorem IX.1.23, it follows that H is the generator of a holomorphic semigroup which is holomorphic in a sector with angle at least C . This completes the proof of the proposition. Let j j be a homogeneous modulus on G (see <ref> [HeS] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The latter reasoning makes essential use of the results of Helffer and Nourrigat <ref> [HeN] </ref> for homogeneous groups. The proof of IV)III is straightforward. <p> A form P is called a Rockland form if P is homogeneous and the operator dU (P ) is injective on the space X 1 (U ) for every nontrivial irreducible unitary representation U of G. The Helffer-Nourrigat theorem, <ref> [HeN] </ref>, states that a homogeneous form P is a positive Rockland form if, and only if, the operator dL (P )j C 1 c (G) is hypoelliptic. A Rockland form P is called a positive Rockland form if dL (P ) is symmetric and positive (see [AER]). <p> The homogeneous structure of the Lie algebra g is exploited through scaling arguments. The arguments are an amalga mation of methods used in <ref> [HeN] </ref> [ElR3] and [AER]. As a preliminary we observe that C &gt; 0. <p> Proof We prove that dL (C) is a Rockland operator, i.e., the operator dU (C) is injective on H 1 (U ) for each non-trivial irreducible representation (H; G; U ). But this is equivalent to hypoellipticity by the Helffer-Nourrigat theorem <ref> [HeN] </ref>. 28 It follows by the definition of subcoercivity and the homogeneity of G that Re ('; H') (N 0 for all ' 2 L 2;1 (G), where = C;G is the ellipticity constant (see Proposition 4.6). <p> So Re ('; dL (C)') max kffk=m=2 Re (1) jffj ('; A hff fl ;ffi ') (17) for all ' 2 L 2;1 (G). Now we argue as in Section 2 and the proof of Proposition 4.6.2 in Helffer-Nourrigat <ref> [HeN] </ref> that Re (x; dU (C)x) max kffk=m=2 Re (1) jffj (x; A hff fl ;ffi x) (18) for every irreducible unitary representation (H; G; U ) and every x 2 H 1 (U ). At this point we merely sketch the proof. <p> At this point we merely sketch the proof. In the proof of Proposition 10.2 we need a refinement of this result and we then give full details. First we note that Proposition 2.1 of <ref> [HeN] </ref>, which gives a norm comparison for two operators, has a version expressed in terms of the forms of the operators. This is evident from the proof of the proposition which relies on Fourier transformation. <p> Replacing the Fourier transforms of the operator norms by similar transforms of the operator forms does not affect the argument. Secondly, one deduces (18) from (17) by the same argument that establishes Proposition 4.6.2 as a consequence of Proposition 4.6.1 in <ref> [HeN] </ref>. This relies upon the form version of Proposition 2.1. One immediately deduces from (18) that Re (x; dU (C)x) (N 0 for every irreducible unitary representation (H; G; U ) and every x 2 H 1 (U ). <p> The proof is a modification of the reduction theorem in Section 2 in <ref> [HeN] </ref>. We will show that Condition III of Theorem 10.1 is valid using a scaling argument and a refinement of the proof of Lemma 5.1. We may assume that p = 2 and fl &lt; 1 by an application of the reiteration theorem [BuB] Proposition 3.2.18. <p> Therefore, by scaling, ffi m Re ('; dL G (P )') ffi 2fl (N L G 2 uniformly for all ffi &gt; 0 and ' 2 L 2;1 (G). Next we need some details about standard induced representations of G. We follow <ref> [HeN] </ref> Section 2 and [CoG]. <p> Since fl &lt; 1 one then establishes that Z d n (g)jgj 2fl j (g; s) c (c 0 ) 2 fg:jgj1g uniformly for all j 2 N and Statement I follows. One can establish Statement II by a similar argument (see also the proof of Lemma 2.2 in <ref> [HeN] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: A crucial element in the proof of the theorem is the local approximation of G by the homogeneous (nilpotent) group G 0 alluded to above. The group G 0 , which has the same dimension as G, is constructed, following an idea of Kashiwara and Vergne <ref> [KaV] </ref>, through exponentiation of a contraction of the Lie algebra g of G. In the unweighted vector space case the contraction process is as follows. For t &gt; 0 define the commutation relation [ ; ] t on g by [a; b] t = t [a; b]. <p> Moreover, for all i and j there exists a multi-index ff ij such that b ij = a [ff ij ] . Secondly, we follow the ideas of Kashiwara and Vergne <ref> [KaV] </ref>, or Hebisch [Heb2] Lemma 4.1.

Reference-contexts: Now let C 1 be a form of order less than or equal to m. Then the operator dL (C 1 +C y 1 ) is symmetric and dL (P 0 )-bounded, by the foregoing bounds. Hence by Theorem VI.1.38 of <ref> [Kat] </ref> one deduces that there exist c 1 &gt; 0 and c 2 2 R such that j ('; dL (C 1 + C 1 )')j c 1 ('; dL (P 0 )') + c 2 k'k 2 for all ' 2 L 0 2;m . <p> Thus H generates a contraction semigroup. Finally, for any 2 h C ; C i the form e i C is also a G-weighted subcoercive form of order m, so the operator e i H = dU (e i C) is the generator of a contraction semigroup. Then by <ref> [Kat] </ref>, Theorem IX.1.23, it follows that H is the generator of a holomorphic semigroup which is holomorphic in a sector with angle at least C . This completes the proof of the proposition. Let j j be a homogeneous modulus on G (see [HeS]). <p> But it then follows from <ref> [Kat] </ref> p. 310 that j (y; dU (=P )x)j M (x; dU (&lt;P )x) 1=2 (y; dU (&lt;P )y) 1=2 (36) m (U ). We shall prove that &lt;P is a Rockland form.

Reference-contexts: If III is valid then dL G 0 (&lt;P ) is hypoelliptic by the Helffer-Nourrigat theorem. More over, the Plancherel formula, <ref> [Kir] </ref> Proposition 4, gives (dL G 0 (&lt;P )'; ') 0 c (G 0 ), and hence by continuity, for all ' 2 L 2;1 (G 0 ). So &lt;P is a positive Rockland form. The implication IV)II follows from Theorem 2.5 of [ElR6].

Reference-contexts: The general contraction procedure was applied to weighted operators of the type we consider, but on nilpotent Lie groups, by Nagel, Ricci and Stein <ref> [NRS] </ref> to obtain asymptotic properties, at the origin, of their fundamental solutions. <p> We denote g and G by g (d 0 ; ; w 1 ; : : : ; w d 0 ) and G (d 0 ; ; w 1 ; : : : ; w d 0 ). These groups play a fundamental role in <ref> [NRS] </ref> and [ElR7], but are not directly relevant to our considerations. We will reconsider these groups in Section 11. 3 Homogenization by contraction Let a 1 ; : : : ; a d 0 be a reduced weighted algebraic basis of the Lie algebra g.

Reference-contexts: Since a 1 ; : : : ; a d 0 is an algebraic basis for (g; [ ; ] t ) it follows from a theorem of Caratheodory that d 0 t (g ; h) is finite for all g; h 2 G t (see also <ref> [NSW] </ref>). <p> Moreover, the sum in R N is absolutely convergent and X fi2J (N) jfijN+1 kc Nfi b [fi] t k 1 : Proof This follows from the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula and induction on N (see <ref> [NSW] </ref> Lemma 2.21 and [VSC] Section III.3). <p> Hence d (2) t (g ; h) (d t (g ; h)) r=M for all g; h 2 G t with d 0 t (g ; h) 1.

So there exist c; " &gt; 0 such that d (3) (4) " 0 . In particular, jgj 0 t = d 0 (3) c d t (g ; e) for all g 2 B (t) 0 .

Reference-contexts: Langlands, in an unpublished thesis [Lan1] (see also [Lan2]), proved that the closure of each strongly elliptic operator H generates a holomorphic semigroup S with a smooth, fast decreasing, representation-independent, integral kernel K. Subsequently, Robinson <ref> [Rob1] </ref> established that K, together with its derivatives, satisfies Gaussian bounds of the appropriate order.

Reference-contexts: Therefore the analysis of general weighted operators, or even unweighted subelliptic operators, compels the use of non-commutative approximants G 0 . Since the work of Rothschild and Stein <ref> [RoS] </ref> it has become a standard procedure to construct local nilpotent approximants to a Lie group. Given an algebraic basis of g with d 0 elements and rank r the Rothschild|Stein approximant e G of G is the nilpotent group with d 0 generators which is free of step r.

Reference-contexts: Then _'(s) = B (t) j '(s) for all s 2 [0; 1]. So ' is a C 1 -function and by the uniqueness theorem for integral curves (see, for example, <ref> [SaW] </ref>, Theorem 2.37) it follows that '(s) = exp t (sb) for all s 2 [0; 1], if " is small enough.

Reference-contexts: The limit defines an algebraic structure on g and the Lie algebra (g; [ ; ] 0 ) is the contraction of (g; [ ; ] t ) in the sense of Saletan <ref> [Sal] </ref>. This construction is uniquely determined by the reduced weighted algebraic basis a 1 ; : : : ; a d 0 . Proposition 3.1 I. The limit [a; b] 0 = lim [a; b] t exists for all a; b 2 g. II.
