Title: Flexible Routing and Addressing For a Next Generation IP

Abstract: Due to a limited address space and poor scaling of backbonerouting information, the Internet Protocol (IP) is rapidly reaching the end of its useful lifetime. The Simple Internet Protocol Plus (SIPP), a proposed next generation Internet Protocol, solves these problems with larger internet layer addresses. In addition, SIPP provides a number of advanced routing and addressing capabilities including mobility, extended (variable-length) addressing, provider selection, and certain forms of multicast. These capabilities are all achieved through a single mechanism, a generalization of the IP loose source route. We argue that, for reasons of simplicity and evolvability, a single powerful mechanism to achieve a wide range of routing and addressing functions is preferable to having multiple specific mechanisms, one for each function.

Reference-contexts: This will cause all packets between X and Y to be routed through P . There a number of ways to defend against this particular attack. The strongest defense is to use the optional SIPP Authentication Header <ref> [1] </ref>. This contains the sender's digital signature, making it difficult for the eavesdropper to modify the route sequence unde tected.

Reference-contexts: as a source address (that is, multicast address sequences are not source-capable), I knows to prepend one of its unicast address sequences to the route sequence, producing: hS:I ; Q:E; ?Q:D; S:H i: Core-based Tree Multicast In core-based tree multicast, multicast packets are routed to their destinations in two phases <ref> [2] </ref>. In the first phase, a packet from a sender to a multicast group is unicast towards a core router. The delivery tree for the multicast group is rooted at this router.

Reference-contexts: We describe two kinds of multicast: traditional multicast <ref> [3] </ref> and core-based tree (CBT) multicast. A node's notion of multicast addressing is extended so that a multicast address is seen as an address sequencerather than a single multicast address as is the case with IP.

Reference-contexts: TCP/IP and related protocols) has initiated a standardization effort for the next generation IP (IPng), a replacement protocol for IP. IPng is required to solve the address depletion and scaling problems of IP. In addition, IPng may add new features to IP. A number of protocols (Pip [7], SIP <ref> [4] </ref>, and TUBA [15]) have been proposed for IPng. All of the proposals solve the basic problems of scaling and address depletion by using larger internet layer addresses. A recent proposal, SIPP (the Simple Internet Protocol Plus), uses SIP's syntax but borrows some of Pip's advanced routing and addressing features.

Reference-contexts: The active target in the route sequence, denoted by a ? immediately preceding it, is set to the SIPP address immediately following S n , the highest-order SIPP address in the source address sequence. The above route sequence is encoded in SIPP headers <ref> [5] </ref> as follows (Figure 2). S 0 and D m are placed in the source and destination address fields of the SIPP header. <p> The flow label field consists of two sub-fields, one of which is the flow ID field (for a more detailed description of the SIPP flow label, see <ref> [5] </ref>). Packets from the same source and carrying the same (non-zero) flow ID are associated with the same special handling state established (by mechanisms which are beyond the scope of this paper) in routers on the path from source to destination. <p> A simpler but weaker defense is to use the flow ID enhancement described in Section 7.1, and to add an optional header that allows a host to indicate what the previous flow ID was when it modifies the routing header. Flow IDs are pseudo-random <ref> [5] </ref>, and since the eavesdropper is not generally able to observe packets from the hosts it wants to eavesdrop on, it is difficult for the eavesdropper to guess the current flow ID.

Reference-contexts: For instance, both Inter-Domain Policy Routing [21] and Source Demand Routing <ref> [6] </ref> use source routing to encode specialized policy routes.

IPng is required to solve the address depletion and scaling problems of IP. In addition, IPng may add new features to IP. A number of protocols (Pip <ref> [7] </ref>, SIP [4], and TUBA [15]) have been proposed for IPng. All of the proposals solve the basic problems of scaling and address depletion by using larger internet layer addresses. <p> Such differences, however, are mechanistic not semantic. It is possible to obtain the semantics of a hierarchical address using the mechanics of a source route. This approach, in its full generality, was first used in Pip <ref> [7] </ref>. In this paper, we show how the generalized source route mechanism is used in SIPP to achieve flexible routing and addressing features. In particular, we illustrate how mobile routing, variable-length addressing, provider selection, and certain forms of multicast routing may be modeled using this mechanism.

Reference-contexts: At first glance, the number of uses for this mechanism appears to be rather limited. Indeed, IP hosts use the loose source route mechanism very infrequently. In actual fact, however, virtually all known routing mechanisms can be modeled as loose source routes <ref> [8] </ref>. For instance, routing on hierarchical addressesthe most common form of routing in the Internetcan be modeled as a loose source route, as we now show. An IP hierarchical address has three levels; network, subnet, and host.

Reference-contexts: A related problem with IP is poor scaling of internet routing. IP routing has historically scaled proportional to the number of IP networks, which is on the order of the number of organizations using IP. Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) <ref> [9] </ref>, a technique which proposes changes in the definition and allocation of IP addresses, may alleviate this problem in the short term. With CIDR, scaling in routing can be nearly proportional to the number of IP service providers (also called IP backbones).

It is difficult to accurately predict when IP addresses will run out, but most estimates range from 5 to 10 years. A related problem with IP is poor scaling of internet routing.

Reference-contexts: H discovers the foreign agent's cluster address through periodic router advertisements (similar to an IS hello advertisement in ES-IS <ref> [11] </ref>). H also periodically advertises its addresses (similar to the ES hello advertisement in ES-IS). This latter advertisement contains H's identifying address. Then, through a mechanism beyond the scope of this paper, H informs its home agent of its new foreign agent.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, [20] describes the use of source routing to solve the host mobility problem. SIPP's route sequence mechanism generalizes these uses of source routing to different routing and addressing paradigms. Other existing network protocols, such as CLNP (Connection-Less Network Protocol, <ref> [12] </ref>) and IP have loose source routing mechanisms. Unlike SIPP, however, CLNP and IP nodes are not required to correctly reverse loose source routes (route sequences) or recognize that packet sources and destinations may be represented as address sequences.

Reference-contexts: for correct formation and reversal of route sequences by nodes. 4.1 Motivation For Route Sequence Reversal To achieve traditional unicast IP address semantics, it is not necessary for IP implementations to correctly reverse IP loose source routes (in fact, there exist IP host implementations that do not reverse source routes, <ref> [13] </ref>). For example, when an IP host receives a packet with a loose source route, it may simply use the sender's IP address as the destination for outgoing packets and completely discard everything else in the source route.

Reference-contexts: Finally, other mechanisms may be defined for achieving one or more of the advanced routing and addressing features enabled by SIPP's used of generalized source routing. For instance, the CLNP packet header allows variable length node addresses. Encapsulation [16] can be used to emulate provider selection [19] and mobility <ref> [14] </ref> in IP. However, we believe that the SIPP approach of having a single framework for providing advancedrouting and addressing functions is more desirable than the other protocols' approach of having multiple different mechanisms for different functions. A single mechanism is more efficient than having multiple mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: Each of these addresses is also an identifying address for the corresponding node. Thus, each node has two one-element address sequences. Before initiating an association with I, H learns I's addresses from the Domain Name System (DNS, <ref> [17] </ref>). To send a packet to I, H may use either of I's addresses. Assume that H chooses Q:E:I, since that address matches best with one of its own addresses. H forms the following route sequence, using the rule described in Section 4.2: hQ:D:H; ?Q:E:I i.
