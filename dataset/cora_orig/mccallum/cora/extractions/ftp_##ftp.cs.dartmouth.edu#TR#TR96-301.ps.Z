Abstract: Department of Computer Science Technical Report PCS-TR96-301 Proceedings of 30th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers Pacific Grove, California, November 2-6, 1996 Abstract This paper presents new algorithms for the rotation of images. The primary design criteria for these algorithms is very high quality. Common methods for image rotation, including convolutional and separable approaches, are examined and shown to exhibit significant high frequency aliasing problems. A new resampling filter design methodology is presented which minimizes the problem for conventional convolution-based image rotation. The paper also presents a new separable image rotation algorithm which exhibits improved performance in term of reduction in artifacts and an efficient O(N 2 logN ) running time.

Reference-contexts: This is simply computed using an inverse FFT. An ideal filter of this form would require infinite support. Since infinite support is not practical, the filter must be truncated, which induces Gibbs oscillations <ref> [1] </ref>. In our experimentation we have employed a simple Hamming window with good results. While simple to understand, convolution-based image rotation has problems, the worst being its computational complexity. Given an N fiN image and an M fiM filter kernel, rotation requires O (N 2 M 2 ) time.

Reference-contexts: If this is not the case the aliased components have become a part of the continuous image the samples now represent, so this issue can be disregarded in this discussion) <ref> [2] </ref>. The sampling theorem also provides a basis for the resampling of this continuous function on the new, rotated, lattice. The combination of reconstruction and resampling allows for high accuracy rotation of images. In realizable systems the reconstruction and resampling filters can be combined. <p> This complexity is similar to three 2-D FFT operations (1.5 times the time to forward and inverse FFT the entire image). This algorithm is based on the use of the Fourier shift property described in <ref> [2] </ref> and the shift technique described in [9]. To shift a row by ffi, the FFT of the row is taken, the transform coefficients are multiplied by exp (j2nffi=N ), effectively adjusting the phase of the components. Then the inverse FFT is taken.

Reference-contexts: For the highest quality, M ! N , tending towards a running time of O (N 4 ). This problem was recognized in early image rotation papers such as <ref> [10, 3] </ref>. These and later papers show that if the rotation can be decomposed into operations only on rows and columns of the image the operations can employ 1-D convolution rather than 2-D convolution. These decompositions are referred to as separable image rotations. <p> These decompositions are referred to as separable image rotations. Two-pass separable image rotation reduces rotation to two scale and skew operations. The first operation reduces image resolution, thereby decreasing image resolution in intermediate images <ref> [3, 10, 5] </ref>. This decrease in resolution is referred to as bottle-necking and results in loss of high frequency content. Three-pass decompositions, as presented in [4, 9], implement rotation using only skew operations and no scaling.

Reference-contexts: Since no scaling occurs, at first glance it would appear that frequency characteristics are unchanged since the image is not magnified or minified as discussed in [11]. However, rotation of an image induces an equivalent rotation of the spectrum of the image <ref> [6] </ref>. As shown in figure 1, spectral content in the corners of an image can rotate beyond the Nyquist frequency. Assuming frequency characteristics such that no aliasing occurs, only an interpolation filter would be required. Interpolation kernels approximate a box filter as closely as possible.

Reference-contexts: Convolution-Based Rotation Convolution-based rotation is the simplest form of rotation. No intermediate images are required and the rotation algorithm is trivial (given a filter kernel). The process of resampling is described in detail in <ref> [7] </ref>. Briefly, the continuous image is reconstructed from the sample points and resampled at the rotated lattice points. The resampling process must low-pass filter the rotated image to remove frequencies beyond the Nyquist frequency in each dimension.

The images were padded with black for SEP3-sinc. The technique detailed in this paper includes its own padding technique. Results for these images are listed in Table 1.
