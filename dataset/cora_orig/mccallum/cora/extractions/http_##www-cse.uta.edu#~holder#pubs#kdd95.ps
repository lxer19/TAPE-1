Abstract: Discovering repetitive, interesting, and functional substructures in a structural database improves the ability to interpret and compress the data. However, scientists working with a database in their area of expertise often search for predetermined types of structures, or for structures exhibiting characteristics specific to the domain. This paper presents a method for guiding the discovery process with domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, the Subdue discovery system is used to evaluate the benefits of using domain knowledge to guide the discovery process. The domain knowledge is incorporated into Subdue following a single general methodology to guide the discovery process. Results show that domain-specific knowledge improves the search for substructures which are useful to the domain, and leads to greater compression of the data. To illustrate these benefits, examples and experiments from the computer programming, computer aided design circuit, and artificially-generated domains are presented.

Reference-contexts: Introduction With the increasing amount and complexity of today's data, there is an urgent need to accelerate the discovery of information and the generation of knowledge from large databases. To date, the Subdue system has been used to discover interesting and repetitive substructures in structural data <ref> (Holder, Cook, & Djoko 1994) </ref>. The substructures are evaluated both by a set of domain-independent heuristics and by the substructures' ability to describe and compress the original data set based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle (Quinlan & Rivest 1989). <p> The compressed graph is encoded as described elsewhere <ref> (Holder, Cook, & Djoko 1994) </ref>. After a substructure is discovered, each instance of the discovered substructure is encoded as an index to the correspond ing model definition. Combining substructure discovery with and without model knowledge .

Reference-contexts: The substructures are evaluated both by a set of domain-independent heuristics and by the substructures' ability to describe and compress the original data set based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle <ref> (Quinlan & Rivest 1989) </ref>. Once the substructures are discovered, they are used to simplify the data by replacing instances of the substructure with a pointer to the substructure definition. The discovered substructures allow abstraction over detailed structure in the original data.
