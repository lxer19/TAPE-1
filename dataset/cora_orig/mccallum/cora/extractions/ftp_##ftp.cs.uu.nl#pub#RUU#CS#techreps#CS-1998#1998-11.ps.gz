Title: Reaching a Polygon with Directional Uncertainty  
Author: Otfried Cheong Rene van Oostrum 
Abstract: Assume a robot that, when directed to move in a particular direction, is guaranteed to move inside a cone of angle ff centered at the specified direction. The robot has to reach a convex polygonal goal G, while avoiding polygonal obstacles of complexity n. We show that the complexity of the safe region, from where the robot can reach the goal with a single linear motion with uncertainty ff, is O(m + n), and can be computed in time O((m + n) log(m + n)), if ff is assumed constant.

Reference-contexts: This finishes the proof of Theorem 3. 5 Implementing the queries It remains to show how to implement the queries efficiently. We can do this by making use of relative convex hulls. A formal definition of relative convex hulls is given in de Berg's thesis <ref> [1, p. 116] </ref>. Informally, the convex hull of P relative to G is the shape an elastic rubber band, wrapped around the points in P , takes when it is released.

Reference-contexts: A model for dealing with directional uncertainty was first proposed by Lozano-Perez, Mason and Taylor [6] and was further developed by Erdmann [4]. A detailed discussion can be found in Latombe's book [5]. We follow the approach of de Berg et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. They assume a point robot|larger robots can be treated using Minkowski sum techniques|that wishes to reach a polygonal goal region while avoiding polygonal obstacles. <p> To simplify the notation, we will use P to denote the set of at most 2n endpoints of segments in S, and use V to denote the set of vertices of G throughout. Observation 1 (de Berg et al. <ref> [2] </ref>) A point on the boundary of R ff (G; S) is either on a segment of S or on an edge of G, or is the apex of an ff-cone fl that has two points p; q 2 P [ V on its left and right rays. <p> In the following, we will give an analysis of the complexity of R ff (G; S) in terms of all n, m, and ff. We are most interested in the case where ff is a constant. Closely following the work of de Berg et al. <ref> [2] </ref> we decompose the problem by considering first the following directed version: Let ~u be a direction vector, and let R ff;~u (G; S) be the region of all points x 2 E 2 for which there exists a safe ff-cone fl with apex x such that the ray with origin <p> To be able to bound the complexity of R ff;~u (G; S) by the complexity of R ff;~u (G; P ) we state the following lemma. Again this is a slight generalization of a result by de Berg et al. <ref> [2] </ref> Lemma 2 R ff;~u (G; S) is the intersection of R ff;~u (G; P ) with the region above the upper envelope of S. u p 2 Proof: Since P is the set of endpoints of the segments in S we have R ff;~u (G; S) R ff;~u (G; P <p> We need to bound the complexity of this union. To prove an upper bound on the complexity of R ff (G; S), we exploit this lemma and the results and techniques of de Berg et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> To prove that the complexity of R ff;~u (G; S) [ R ff;~v (G; S) for two fixed directions ~u and ~v is bounded by O ((m + n)=ff 3 ), we can apply the results of de Berg et al. <ref> [2] </ref> for the situation with a set S of n obstacle segments, and a goal region "at infinity", with some minor modifications. We summarize these results below; details can be found in de Berg et al. [2]. <p> + n)=ff 3 ), we can apply the results of de Berg et al. <ref> [2] </ref> for the situation with a set S of n obstacle segments, and a goal region "at infinity", with some minor modifications. We summarize these results below; details can be found in de Berg et al. [2]. We can approximate the boundary fi of R ff;~u (G; S) by two polygonal chains fi 0 and fi 00 of the same complexity O (m + n), such that fi is enclosed between fi 0 and fi 00 . <p> In the same way, we can approximate the boundary of R ff;~v (G; S) by two polygonal chains 0 and 00 . De Berg et al. <ref> [2] </ref> have shown that the number of intersections between fi and is bounded by the number of intersections between two of the chains fi 0 , fi 00 , 0 and 00 . <p> The complexity of R ff (G; S) is bounded by O ((m + n)=ff 5 ). 4 Computing the safe region In this section we show how to compute R ff (G; S). Like de Berg et al. <ref> [2] </ref>, we do so in a manner similar to the structure of the proof of Theorem 2. <p> It remains to combine the R ff;~u (G; S) for O (1=ff) different directions ~u. We use a divide and conquer algorithm on the set U of O (1=ff) directions to do this, again closely following de Berg et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. The merging step can be done in time O ((m +n +K) log (m + n)) by a standard plane sweep algorithm, where K is the complexity of the merged region.

Reference-contexts: It remains to prove that the complexity of all these pairwise unions is O (m + n)=ff 3 ). The combination lemma by Edelsbrunner et al. <ref> [3] </ref> states that the complexity of the union of two polygonal regions is bounded by the individual complexities of the two regions plus the number of holes in the union.
