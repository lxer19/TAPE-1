Abstract: This paper presents a resource based pricing policy for real-time channels ( ie., channels with guaranteed performance ) in a packet switching network. The policy is based on a set of specific criteria, and the charges for any channel are based on the resources reserved for use by the channel. This reservation charge is based on the type of service requested, the time of day during which the channel exists, and the lifetime of the channel. We argue that the traditional resources are not sufficient to determine a fair reservation charge for a channel offering guaranteed delay bounds, and we introduce the notion of a delay resource in our charging formula. The type of service requested is thus characterized by the amount of the bandwidth, buffer space, CPU, and delay resources reserved. The analysis of this pricing policy is reduced to the analysis of a single node of the network, assuming a homogeneous network. This single-node characteristic increases the scalability and flexibility of the policy. An example of an implementation of this policy is provided. hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh This research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Cooperative Agreement NCR-8919038 with the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, by AT&T Bell Laboratories, Hitachi, Ltd., Hitachi America, Ltd., Pacific Bell, the University of California under a MICRO grant, and the International Computer Science Institute.

Reference-contexts: The charges are applied to the duration of time the channel existed or the number of packets sent during the peak load and non peak load periods <ref> [1] </ref>. In the case of Static Peak Load pricing, requirements (1) and (3) are not met. The first three requirements, (1),(2), and (3), are not met in the case of Dynamic Peak Load pricing.

Reference-contexts: The per-packet rates may be set and changed due to the demands of the other clients as they increase their priority levels <ref> [2] </ref>. The main problem with this scheme is that it fails to meet requirements (1), (2) and (4). As with the Peak Load pricing policy, the service provider may not collect revenue commensurate with the service provided, as clients may acquire connections and not use them.

Reference-contexts: The total revenue of the network is also decreased, as no revenue is generated by these connections. This policy will be referred to in the sequel as the Multiple Fixed-Priority Based Policy. An example of this pricing policy is given in <ref> [3] </ref>. As can be seen from the reviews presented above, the conventional schemes are inadequate for our purposes. A new policy is needed that meets all the requirements stated above. This policy is presented in the next section. 3. A Pricing Policy for Real-Time Channel Establishment Scheme.

Reference-contexts: In this section, the proposed pricing policy will be presented. It will then be analyzed with regard to the requirements, and applied to our real-time channel establishment scheme. The reader is assumed to have some knowledge of the traffic characterization and the channel establishment scheme found in reference <ref> [4] </ref>. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that only real-time traffic will be present on the network. It should be noted however that the policy could easily support non real-time traffic services. - 4 - 3.1. The Proposed Pricing Policy.

Reference-contexts: A complete discussion of these buffer space equations can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. The Buffers () function provides the number of buffers needed per node using as parameters the channel characteristics of each channel type. This value, multiplied by the number of nodes in the path, gives the total number of buffers needed.
