Abstract: Radical simplification is an important part of symbolic computation systems. Zippel [7] gave a sufficient condition for a nested radical to be expressed in terms of radicals of lower nesting depth. We fill a lacuna in his proof, and show that his sufficient condition is also necessary. Previous work by Landau and Miller [4] leads to an algorithm for the problem.
