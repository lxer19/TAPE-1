Reference-contexts: The winners were selected by a panel of judges, and are shown below. 2 Winning submissions and honorable mentions 2.1 Graph A Graph A models the architecture of a computer chip and was based on the hand-drawn original shown in Figure 1 <ref> [1] </ref>. The winning drawing was submitted by Georg Sander of Universitat des Saarlandes (sander@cs.uni-sb.de), and is shown in Figure 2. The manual steps needed to produce this drawing included a partitioning of the graph into subgraphs, adjustment of the level assignments of the nodes, and selection of various rendering parameters.
