Reference-contexts: Instead of using a phone bigram model, the Angie framework is used. A phone error rate of 36% is achieved, compared to the baseline result of 40%. Hierarchical Duration Modeling for Speech Recognition Using Angie Chung <ref> [1] </ref> uses Angie to determine the duration models for different sub-word segments. Interesting regularities are discovered, such as the fact that the duration of suffixes is affected more than prefixes by speaking rate. Words before pauses are spoken slower. <p> A lexical representation in terms of a hierarchical, multi-level structure turns out to be very versatile for speech and language applications. So far the structure provided by Angie has been used in various tasks, including letter-to-sound/sound-to-letter generation [10], phone recognition [12], duration modeling <ref> [1] </ref>, and word-spotting [7], as described in the introductory chapter. <p> We could also discover whether this knowledge would improve the likelihood of getting stress correct for other nouns/verbs besides the original homographs. This linguistically rich information could be used in conjunction with acoustic waveforms to tease out regularities. Chung <ref> [1] </ref> has found a correlation between durations of phones and pre-pausal words with the aid of our morphs. Also, we already know the very frequent function words have much more reduced pronunciations than other words.

Reference-contexts: The technique is to relabel the Comlex phonemes to their Angie phoneme equivalent to provide these mappings. The stress and secondary stressed vowels ("non-main-stress") are both transcribed as stressed Angie phonemes. Then, the align program <ref> [2] </ref> is used to align the Angie and Comlex phonemic transcriptions for each word. If there are alternate transcriptions, every combination of Angie and Comlex transcriptions is aligned. There are 7,580 different Angie-Comlex transcription pairs. The align program then tabulates the mis-alignments. <p> We have developed a procedure to automatically derive rules with the help of the align program <ref> [2] </ref>. A description of this procedure is given in subsection 4.5.1. Hand-written rules may be more restrictive and accurate, since they are written by a human, who has some knowledge of possible generalities to include as well as some restrictions to apply.

Reference-contexts: If the information is instead derived from the acoustic signal, the accuracy improves, but it is not quite as significant. The word error rate here drops by 10% to 9.2%. 1.2.3 Incorporating Morphology into Large Vocabulary Speech Recogni tion Systems Geutner's <ref> [3] </ref> motivation behind using morphemes in speech recognition is twofold. First, the language being recognized, German, is a highly inflected language, where new words are created simply by adding short, syllable level affixes. Since nouns can be concatenated indefinitely, there are an uncountable number of compound words.

Reference-contexts: Then the vocabulary could be dynamically updated with this word, providing a seamless method for handling unknown words in speech recognition. Another scenario is when a user uses our Galaxy system <ref> [4] </ref> to find bookstores in Cambridge. A list of bookstores, all with names unfamiliar to the recognizer, is returned. Since the recognizer does not know the words, it will be impossible for the user to refer to them by name.
