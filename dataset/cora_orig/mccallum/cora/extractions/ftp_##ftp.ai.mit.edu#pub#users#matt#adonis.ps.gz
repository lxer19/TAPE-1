Abstract: Our previous work has demonstrated how biologically-inspired behaviors can serve as an effective substrate for control, representation, and learning in mobile robots and multi-robot systems, in order to generate adaptive individual and group behavior. In this paper, we expand the behavior-based approach to the domain of manipulator control, and demonstrate first results in applying biological inspiration to a 20 degree-of freedom humanoid dynamical torso simulation.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the behavior tuning is specific to the shoulder-head configuration and does not generalize to other self-collisions. There are two ways of addressing this issue: assuming that self-collisions are critical enough to merit special-purpose fine-tuned avoidance strategies (as may be the case in biological movement <ref> (Arbib, Schweighofer & Thatch 1995) </ref>), or developing a higher-level smoothing behavior, as done in 2D path planning. use of collision-avoidance; Figure 4 shows the same transition, with blending of the avoid behavior to generate a legal movement.

Reference-contexts: Their work and ours are both based on the same biological inspiration, but their system uses postural primitives while we use movement behaviors instead. Behavior-based control has been used extensively in navigation; <ref> (Arkin 1987) </ref> introduced motor schemas, which are akin to behaviors, for mobile robot control, and related methods for combining them. The behaviors we discuss are based on the same principles as the generic homing behavior used in Mataric (1995), which moves a mobile robot toward a specified 2D Cartesian goal.

Reference-contexts: Manipulator work largely focuses on the difficult problems of inverse kinematics and dynamics (Paul 1981, Brady et al. 1982), and learning techniques are often employed to overcome the high dimensionality of the problem <ref> (Atke-son 1989, Schaal & Atkeson 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This desired force is implemented by applying torques (t ) at the joints, using the following simple relation (Craig 1989): t = J T F (2) The method has several advantages over position control techniques using inverse kinematics <ref> (Baker & Wampler II 1988) </ref>. It is computationally simple, requiring only the forward kinematics and the Jacobian (Whit-ney 1982), and it is stable both when moving freely, and during contact with surfaces (Hogan 1985).

Reference-contexts: Arranging the control of the arm in this way has advantages in terms of stability, especially when interacting with different environments <ref> (Colgate & Hogan 1989) </ref>. We implemented an impedance-based controller as follows.

Reference-contexts: When combined with other behaviours, it can generate movement trajectories around obstacles and towards goals. However, the approach is not sufficient for generating smooth trajectories around obstacles. In fact, while direct reaching in biological systems is known to typically proceed along a straight Cartesian path <ref> (Flash & Hogan 1985) </ref>, little is know about trajectory generation around obstacles. Most theories involve the use of carefully chosen intermediate via points (Miyamoto, Schaal, Gandolfo, Gomi, Koike, Osu, Nakano, Wada & Kawato 1996) which produce a smooth path around the obstacle.

Reference-contexts: The implementation of each is described in turn. 4.1 Move-to-Point by Impedance Control The general principle of impedance control <ref> (Hogan 1985) </ref> is to modulate the mechanical impedance of the endpoint of an arm, by altering the torques at the arm's joints. Mechanical impedance for an object is defined as the relationship between an imposed disturbance and a generated force. <p> It is computationally simple, requiring only the forward kinematics and the Jacobian (Whit-ney 1982), and it is stable both when moving freely, and during contact with surfaces <ref> (Hogan 1985) </ref>. It also fits well into the primitive-based approach; rather than use inverse kinematics for all joints, which would be very computationally intensive, a mixture of simpler control schemes can be used. <p> When combined with other behaviours, it can generate movement trajectories around obstacles and towards goals. However, the approach is not sufficient for generating smooth trajectories around obstacles. In fact, while direct reaching in biological systems is known to typically proceed along a straight Cartesian path <ref> (Flash & Hogan 1985) </ref>, little is know about trajectory generation around obstacles.

Reference-contexts: A direct combination or blending of avoid with the other behaviors (much like in our previous work on flocking <ref> (Mataric 1992) </ref>) produces legal and correct (i.e., goal-achieving) movements. However, the resulting trajectory is not optimal and may be quite unnatural.

Reference-contexts: The idea of supplying an agent with a collection of basis behaviors or primitives to generate motion, and combining those into a general repertoire for complex motion, is very appealing. Our previous work <ref> (Mataric 1995, Mataric 1997) </ref>, inspired by the same biological results, has already successfully applied the idea to control of planar mobile robots.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, the vast majority of behavior-based systems to date have been applied to planar navigation problems. We present a generalization of behavior-based control to the domain of manipulator control, which has been largely under the umbrella of traditional robotics and geometric reasoning <ref> (Paul 1981, Brady, Hollerbach, Johnson, Lozano-Perez & Mason 1982) </ref>. In contrast, we take inspiration from neuro-science and describe an approach toward implementing a general articulated motion controller gbased on distributed behaviors. We demonstrate the first stages of our approach on a 20 degree-of-freedom humanoid torso simulation with dynamics. <p> Instead, we review only the most related approaches, both in behavior-based control in general, and in manipulation in specific. Manipulator work largely focuses on the difficult problems of inverse kinematics and dynamics <ref> (Paul 1981, Brady et al. 1982) </ref>, and learning techniques are often employed to overcome the high dimensionality of the problem (Atke-son 1989, Schaal & Atkeson 1994).
