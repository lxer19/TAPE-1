Title: Oblivious Transfer with a Memory-Bounded Receiver ***Preliminary Version***  
Author: Christian Cachin Claude Crepeau Julien Marcil 
Date: May 7, 1998  
Abstract: We propose a protocol for oblivious transfer that is unconditionally secure under the sole assumption that the memory size of the receiver is bounded. The model assumes that a random bit string slightly larger than the receiver's memory is broadcast (either by the sender or by a third party). In our construction, both parties need O(n 22ff ) memory for some ff &lt; 1 2 , whereas a malicious receiver can have up to fln 2fffi bits of memory for any fi &gt; 0 and fl &lt; 1. In the course of our analysis, we provide two tools that may be of independent interest: an efficiently computable, dense encoding of k-element subsets from an n-set and a direct analysis of the interactive hashing protocol by Naor et al. [NOVY98].

Reference-contexts: The study and comparison of different assumptions under which cryptographic tasks can be realized is an important aspect of research in cryptography. Perhaps the most prominent primitives used today in the computational security model are factoring, the discrete logarithm problem, and lattice reduction problems <ref> [AD97] </ref>. However, precisely factoring and computing discrete logarithms could be solved efficiently on a quantum computer [Sho94]. Alternatives to computational security assumptions that have been proposed include quantum cryptography, the noisy channel model, and memory bounds [CM97].

Reference-contexts: However, precisely factoring and computing discrete logarithms could be solved efficiently on a quantum computer [Sho94].

The memory bound model seems realistic in the view of current communication and high-speed networking technologies that allow transmission at rates of multiple gigabits per second. Storage systems on the order of petabytes, on the other hand, require a major investment by a potential adversary. <p> protocol are privacy amplification (or entropy smoothing) by universal hashing [BBCM95] and a theorem by Zuckerman about the min-entropy of a randomly chosen substring [Zuc96]. 1.2 Related Work For the purpose of secrecy, memory bounds have been exploited in a similar model in the cryp-tosystem proposed by Cachin and Maurer <ref> [CM97] </ref>. They describe a private-key cryptosystem and a protocol for key agreement by public discussion based on the assumption that an adversary's memory capacity is bounded. <p> It is an interesting open problem whether this difference can be enlarged. For example, in the cryptosystem by Cachin and Maurer based on memory bounds <ref> [CM97] </ref>, the security margin is about O (n) vs. n 2 for the public key agreement protocol. We believe that this should also be achievable for oblivious transfer.

Reference-contexts: The security margin for their key agreement protocol is O (n) memory needed for Alice and Bob versus no more than n 2 memory for an adversary. Space bounds have also been studied with respect to interactive proof systems. Kilian <ref> [Kil88b] </ref> constructed a proof system for any language in PSPACE, which is zero knowledge with respect to a logarithmic space-bounded verifier. Kilian's technique can be extended to any known space verifier with polynomial space bounds. In this protocol, the memory bound and interaction are interleaved in a crucial way.

Reference-contexts: The good set consists of the bits also known to Bob and the bad set contains at least some bits unknown to Bob. This is done using the interactive hashing protocol of Naor et al. <ref> [NOVY98] </ref>. Interactive hashing is a protocol between Alice and Bob for isolating two binary strings. One string is Bob's input and the other one is chosen randomly, without (too much) influence by Bob.
