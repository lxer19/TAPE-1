Abstract: The Web is based on a browsing paradigm that makes it difficult to retrieve and integrate data from multiple sites. Today, the only way to achieve this integration is by building specialized applications, which are time-consuming to develop and difficult to maintain. We are addressing this problem by creating the technology and tools for rapidly constructing information mediators that extract, query, and integrate data from web sources. The resulting system, called Ariadne, makes it feasible to rapidly build information mediators that access existing web sources.

Reference-contexts: The Ariadne query planner [2] was designed to efficienlty generate high-quality plans while combining both source selection and traditional query optimization. Our approach, based on <ref> [1] </ref>, is to generate a possibly suboptimal initial plan and then iteratively transform it by applying a set of declarative rewriting rules. Also, sometimes a plan can use information generated at run-time to determine which source to access.

Reference-contexts: The highly combinatorial nature of query planning in mediators arises from these two independent sources of complexity, namely, the ordering of data processing operators and the selection of relevant information sources for terms in a given query. The Ariadne query planner <ref> [2] </ref> was designed to efficienlty generate high-quality plans while combining both source selection and traditional query optimization. Our approach, based on [1], is to generate a possibly suboptimal initial plan and then iteratively transform it by applying a set of declarative rewriting rules.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Ariadne is a system for building mediators that can gather and integrate information from multiple Internet sources. Recently, information integration from multiple sources has been done using a mediator approach. Examples include sims <ref> [3] </ref>, Information Manifold [7], and tsimmis [6]. In these approaches, the mediator is aware of the information present in different sources and retrieves information from them through a `wrapper' around each source. sims has been used to integrate information from heterogeneous database systems.

Reference-contexts: Whenever a new web source of interest has to be incorporated into an mediator application, we can build a wrapper for it with minimal effort using the wrapper generation toolkit <ref> [4, 9] </ref>. 2.4 Caching to Improve Performance Retrieving data from Web sources is time consuming. At present the time to retrieve an individual page via HTTP is quite high (typically 2-5s).

Reference-contexts: Also, sometimes a plan can use information generated at run-time to determine which source to access. Our query planner uses such run-time information to minimize the number of sources accesed <ref> [5] </ref>. A second challenge arises from the fact that the capabilities of Web sources are often more limited than those of traditional database systems. In particular, many Web sources impose additional constraints on retrieval such as binding pattern constraints.

Reference-contexts: Each source provides different but related information. The mediator is aware of exactly what information is provided by each individual source. In this way, the user is shielded from this information and is presented with an integrated view of the data. We use the loom knowledge representation system <ref> [8] </ref> for modeling data. A domain model that represents the integrated view of the data from the different sources is built in loom and the user poses queries against this model.

Reference-contexts: However, it is impractical to construct wrappers for Web sources by hand because there are too many sources available and they change too fast. As a part of Ariadne, we have developed a machine learning algorithm <ref> [9] </ref> that is able to semi-automatically generate wrappers for Web sources. <p> Whenever a new web source of interest has to be incorporated into an mediator application, we can build a wrapper for it with minimal effort using the wrapper generation toolkit <ref> [4, 9] </ref>. 2.4 Caching to Improve Performance Retrieving data from Web sources is time consuming.
