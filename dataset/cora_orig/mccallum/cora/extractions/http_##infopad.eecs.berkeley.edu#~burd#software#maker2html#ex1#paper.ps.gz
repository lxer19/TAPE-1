Abstract: A key to the success of future Personal Communications Systems is going to be the end-user devices or terminals that will allow users to have untethered access to fixed multimedia information servers. This paper addresses the key issues behind the design of a multimedia I/O terminal currently being implemented. The portability requirement places severe constraints on the power consumption requiring a system level approach to power reduction. This includes partitioning of computation and optimizing algorithms, architectures, circuit styles and technology. In addition to reducing the power consumption and meeting bandwidth requirements, portable operation imposes additional challenges on the system design in order to deal with high bit error rates of wireless communications.

Reference-contexts: Thus our vision of a future personal communications system currently centers on such integration of services, providing ubiquitous access to data and communications accessed through a specialized, wireless multimedia terminal. As discussed in <ref> [1] </ref>, our view of the wireless terminal is that it will be in full duplex communication with a networked base station, which serves as a gateway between the wired and wireless mediums.

Reference-contexts: The only likely new technology, which will take over from NiCd over the next few years is Nickel- Metal Hydride, since it alone provides a combination of enhanced performance (30-35 Wh/lb) while being environmentally safe <ref> [3] </ref>. However, projections for the next 5 years, for even this new technology , predict an improvement of only an additional 30%. We can thus make a reasonable estimate of the power available for future portable systems.

Reference-contexts: However , ultra low voltage operation with an architectural design strategy can reduce the power requirements by an order of magnitude <ref> [4] </ref>. Yet, even this will not be enough to make possible the most exciting new future applications of portable electronics; they will additionally require the use of the future, ubiquitous wireless communication networks. <p> The quadratic dependence of energy on voltage makes it clear that operating at the lowest possible voltage is most desirable for optimizing the energy per computation; unfortunately, reducing the supply voltage comes at a cost of a reduction in the computational throughput <ref> [4] </ref>. One way to compensate for these increased delays is to use architectures that reduce the speed requirements of operations while keeping throughput constant. To illustrate this point consider the text/graphics frame-buf fer.

Reference-contexts: Partitioning of Computation The problem of implementing low power , general purpose processing (X-server, word processing, etc.) is primarily being addressed by power down strategies of subsystems, with a limited amount of voltage scaling <ref> [5] </ref>. This is ef fective to some extent, but because of the dif ficulty in determining when an application is really idle, there also needs to be modif ications to the software and operating system to fully utilize processor inactivity.
