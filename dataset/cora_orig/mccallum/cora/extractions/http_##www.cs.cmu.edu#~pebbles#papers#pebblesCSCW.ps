Abstract: The Pebbles project is creating applications to connect multiple Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) to a main computer such as a PC. We are using 3Com PalmPilots because they are starting to be ubiquitous. We created the Remote Commander application to allow users to take turns sending input from their PalmPilots to the PC as if they were using the PCs mouse and keyboard. PebblesDraw is a shared whiteboard application we built that allows all of the users to send input simultaneously while sharing the same PC display. We are investigating the use of these applications in various contexts, such as co-located meetings.

Reference-contexts: Other groups are studying the use of PalmPilots in various settings, where they are not connected to a PC. For example, NotePals synchronizes peoples independent notes after a meeting [7], and Georgia Techs Classroom 2000 project <ref> [1] </ref> is studying the use of PalmPilots in classrooms. THE PALMPILOT The PalmPilot (see http://palmpilot.3com.com/) is a small inexpensive handheld Personal Digital Assistant (see by 3Com) and also now sold by IBM as the WorkPad (see http://www.pc.ibm.com/us/workpad/). The PalmPilot sold over one million units in its first 18 months.

Reference-contexts: The term Single Display Groupware was coined by Stewart et. al. [23]. Stewarts KidPad [23] is a SDG environment for kids, where multiple mice are connected to a Unix computer. It uses local tools <ref> [2] </ref> on Pad++, where each tool does exactly one thing (for example, there is a crayon tool). This model is easier for kids than conventional palettes, but it does not have any global state (so, for example, there is no concept of a selection).

Reference-contexts: Of course, regular undo is always possible. Multiuser undo has been previously studied in various systems, such as GINA <ref> [3] </ref>. The implementation architecture that supports PebblesDraw is described in a separate paper [12]. Briefly, the part of the Remote Commander that accepts input from the serial ports and then converts it into events is linked in with the Amulet toolkit [14].

Reference-contexts: The PDA-ITV project [20] explored the use of a Newton to control Interactive TV, but used a single real-estate application for shopping for houses, and only dealt with one Newton at a time. MMM <ref> [4] </ref> (Multi-Device, MultiUser, Multi-Editor) was one of the first Single Display Groupware (SDG) environ ments to explore multiple mice on a single display. MMM handled up to three mice. <p> In particular, the standard widgets, like selection handles, palettes, and pull-down menus, do not work for multiple users. Previous SDG systems had little state associated with each user. For example, in KidPad [23] there are no selections. Tivoli [17] supports only a few pen widths. MMM <ref> [4] </ref> only dealt with up to 4 users. We wanted to support more of the choices available in typical drawing programs so a more general mechanism was required. However, we wanted the interaction style to be similar to conventional direct manipulation applications, so it would be familiar. <p> The problem with conventional selection handles is that they do not show which user has the object selected. One goal for PebblesDraw is that each users actions are independent. Each user therefore must have their own separate selection handles. Most previous SDG applications, such as MMM <ref> [4] </ref>, assign each user a color. Since PebblesDraw allows each user to select a color that will next be drawn, we thought using color-coding would be confusing.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, KidPad does not face many of the issues addressed in our Pebbles work. Background studies showed that children often argue and fight when trying to share a single mouse [22], but when using separate mice, cooperated more effectively. Another SDG effort is the COLT toolkit <ref> [5] </ref>, which explores some limited kinds of user interactions and showed that children will stay more focused on their tasks when each child has their own mouse and they simultaneously manipulate the same object together. <p> Since PebblesDraw allows each user to select a color that will next be drawn, we thought using color-coding would be confusing. In fact, the developer of KidPad [23] reported that using color as feedback was not a good idea because kids had a lot of trouble. COLT <ref> [5] </ref> also used a color to identify people, and reported running into trouble with one color-blind user. For all these reasons, we assign each user a shape. The model was a game like Monopoly where each person picks a shape as their piece.

Reference-contexts: In earlier work, we found that it is more effective to use the other hand for scrolling, since then the user will naturally operate both input devices at the same time <ref> [6] </ref>. We will explore using the PalmPilot as the other input device, so it can be used with the other hand for scrolling. Instead of having the users current modes shown in the cursor as in PebblesDraw, they might be shown on each persons PalmPilot screen.

Reference-contexts: For example, the Xerox CoLab [21] and the Univ. of Arizonas electronic meeting room [15] had computers for each person built into special tables. Another previous approach was the Xerox Liveboard <ref> [8] </ref>, which originally supported multiple cursors operating at the same time, but when produced commercially, only supported one person with one cursor at a time. Liveboards proved to be too expensive to be widely used. The Tivoli system [17] supports up to three people using pens simultaneously on the LiveBoard.

Reference-contexts: Most of the PARC building was wired with special IR transceivers to make the ParcTabs work. The ParcTab screen was 128x64 pixels and had a few hardwired buttons and a touch-sensitive screen, which supported the Unistrokes <ref> [9] </ref> alphabet, which is similar to (and predates) PalmPilots Graffiti.

Reference-contexts: The gesture recognizer is trainable, so new gestures can be easily added <ref> [10] </ref>. each command is marked with the shape for the user who performed it. The undo dialog box for Amulet was augmented to annotate each command with the shape for the user who executed it (see Figure 9).

Reference-contexts: Another application might support voting, which could either be formal secret or role-call votes, or the informal how is the speaker doing style of votes that were done for the ParcTab [24]. Another planned project is joint work with Alex Waibel to use his NPen++ handwriting recognizer <ref> [11] </ref> with the PalmPilot. NPen++ is much more accurate than previous attempts (like the Apple Newton), but is currently too large to run on the PalmPilot.

Reference-contexts: The normal Undo command undoes the last executed command no matter who executed it. The Undo-by-User command undoes the last command of the user who executes this undo command. This takes advantage of Amulets selective undo mechanism <ref> [13] </ref> which can undo any previous operation if it still makes sense. For example, in Figure 9, if Herb performs undo-by-user, it will skip over Bonnies commands and undo the Move of a rectangle (command # 34).

Instead of inserting these events into the regular Windows input stream, as for the regular Remote Commander, Amulet was augmented to directly accept multiple, parallel streams of input. The Amulet behavior objects (called interactors) and widgets were augmented to accept a userid parameter.

We want to see which of these will be effective if used with PalmPilots and a single PC display.

Reference-contexts: Having a single, shared visual display is important for coordination and collaboration <ref> [16] </ref>, and people will take turns or all work together on these displays. A second use for Remote Commander is to support small, informal meetings.

The Tivoli project <ref> [17] </ref> mentioned this problem with palettes, but apparently provided no feedback as to the users modes. <p> Gestural input is a quick and easy way to give commands without using a tool palette. With a gesture, the path of the input device is used to interpret the meaning. Like Tivoli <ref> [17] </ref>, PebblesDraw supports gestural input. For example, in PebblesDraw, making an L shape while pressing the right mouse button (or the bottom PalmPilot arrow button) creates a new rectangle no matter what the current selected mode is. Making a circular shape with the right mouse button down creates a circle.

Reference-contexts: In order to connect multiple PalmPilots to a PC at one time, the PC needs multiple serial ports. For desktop PCs, there are many cards available which provide multiple serial ports. The one we found costs about $400 for 8 ports. For laptops, we found the QSP-100 PCMCIA card <ref> [18] </ref> which provides 4 ports (see Figure 3) and costs about $500. Most laptops have 2 PCMCIA slots, so this allows up to 8 serial ports using two cards in the laptop.

Reference-contexts: The Palm-Pilot can also be used as the users private space, if they want to compose content before sharing it with the group. Another idea is to use the PalmPilot to hold items temporarily, like the Pick-and-Drop pens <ref> [19] </ref> that make it easy to transfer information from one computer to another. Of course, we want to explore many other applications of these ideas to new domains.

Reference-contexts: The ParcTab was used to investigate some aspects of remote cursors, and informal voting about how well the speaker was doing, but due to problems with the IR, they found that multiple people simultaneously using the devices in the same room did not work well.
