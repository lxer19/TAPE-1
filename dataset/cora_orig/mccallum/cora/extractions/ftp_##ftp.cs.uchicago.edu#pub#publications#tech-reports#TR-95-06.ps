Abstract: We prove unlikely consequences of the existence of sparse hard sets for P under deterministic as well as one-sided error randomized truth-table reductions. Our main results are as follows. We establish that the existence of a polynomially dense hard set for P under (randomized) logspace bounded truth-table reductions implies that P (R)L, and that the collapse goes down to P (R)NC 1 in case of reductions computable in (R)NC 1 . We also prove that the existence of a quasipolynomially dense hard set for P under (randomized) polylog-space truth-table reductions using polylogarithmically many queries implies that P (R)SPACE[polylog n]. The randomized space complexity classes we consider are based on the multiple access randomness concept.

Reference-contexts: Cai, Naik and Sivakumar next considered truth-table reductions. They showed that the existence of a sparse hard set for P under bounded truth-table reductions implies P = NC 2 , but left the implication P = L open <ref> [CNS95] </ref>. We establish here that this ultimate collapse does follow from that hypothesis, and that the collapse goes down to P = NC 1 if the reductions are computable in NC 1 . <p> The construction in the proof is less complicated than in <ref> [CNS95] </ref>. As a result, by another instantiation of our theorem, we are able to prove that there is a quasipolynomially dense hard set for P under polylog-space truth-table reductions using polylogarithmically many queries iff P is in polylog-space, resolving another open problem mentioned in [CNS95]. <p> proof is less complicated than in <ref> [CNS95] </ref>. As a result, by another instantiation of our theorem, we are able to prove that there is a quasipolynomially dense hard set for P under polylog-space truth-table reductions using polylogarithmically many queries iff P is in polylog-space, resolving another open problem mentioned in [CNS95]. <p> We strengthen our generic theorem to also hold for randomized truth-table reductions with one-sided error, which allows us to extend the result of <ref> [CNS95] </ref> to truth-table reductions. The strengthening also yields that there is a quasipolynomially dense hard set for P under one-sided error randomized polylog-space truth-table reductions with confidence at least inversely quasipolynomial and using polylogarithmically many queries, iff P is in randomized polylog-space. The organization of this paper is as follows. <p> However, for the case of a reduction from L 1 , Cai, Naik and Sivakumar <ref> [CNS95] </ref> make the following observation: Let Y be any subset of m fi . * Either there is an i 2 f1; : : :; kg and a string w i such that for many (y; b) 2 Y , f i (&lt; C; x; y; b &gt; ) = w <p> Before embarking on the formal proof that these ideas work, for the sake of completeness of the overview of recent progress on the sparse hard set problem for P, we mention the result of Cai, Naik and Sivakumar in <ref> [CNS95] </ref> that the existence of a sparse hard set for P under logspace bounded truth-table reductions implies that P NC 2 . <p> r ; u; v &gt;) = w i g (&lt; C; x; 1 r ; u; v &gt;)(b I;(w i ) i2I ) = 1 2 Remedies include limiting the number of generators that make queries of a particular kind, and case distinctions on g. 3 The Vandermonde system in <ref> [CNS95] </ref> has a prefixed coefficient matrix, whence solving it does not recur to Fact 4. where b I;(w i ) i2I = (b j ) k j=1 with b j = ( 0 o.w.; has cardinality at least n. <p> Putting e = 1 and f = 0 in Theorem 4, we are able to solve an open problem in <ref> [CNS95] </ref>. Corollary 5 There is a sparse hard set for P under logspace bounded truth-table reductions iff P = L. <p> The case e = f = 1 in Theorem 4 settles another open problem in <ref> [CNS95] </ref>. Corollary 9 If there is a sparse hard set for P under logspace O (log n)-truth-table reductions, then P DSPACE [log 3 n]. <p> In particular, the following in some sense stronger resolution of the second open problem in <ref> [CNS95] </ref> mentioned above, holds: Corollary 11 There is a quasipolynomially dense hard set for P under polylog-space truth-table reductions using no more than polylogarithmically many queries iff P DSPACE [polylog n]. <p> Using an NC ` computable reduction of L 0 instead of L 2 to S in the proof of Theorem 2, allows to construct an NC ` family of circuits for L. 2 Theorems 12 and 13 extend analogous theorems proven in <ref> [CNS95] </ref> for many-one reductions. 4 Randomized Reductions 4.1 Generic Theorem We now show how we can extend our generic theorem to randomized truth-table reductions with one-sided error. <p> They extend theorems of <ref> [CNS95] </ref> for randomized many-one reductions with one-sided error. Theorem 17 Let e &gt; 1, f &gt; 0, and g &gt; 0. <p> Corollary 22 There is a quasipolynomially dense hard set for P under one-sided error randomized polylog-space truth-table reductions with confidence at least inversely quasipolynomial that use no more than polylogarithmically many queries iff P RSPACE [polylog n]. 20 As in <ref> [CNS95] </ref>, the Valiant-Vazirani one-sided error randomized polynomial-time reduction of satisfiability to unique satisfiability [VV86] allows to apply the strategy behind the generic theorem to collapse other complexity classes than P. We first consider NP. <p> Finally, we can extend the results of <ref> [CNS95] </ref> for NL as follows: Theorem 25 There is a hard sparse set for NL under one-sided error randomized bounded truth table reductions computable in RL and with confidence at least inversely polynomial iff NL RL. Proof (Sketch) Let L 2 NL and M be an NL machine accepting L. <p> As to the randomized reductions with one-sided error, it is an open question whether the results of section 4.2 also hold for the more natural read-once concept for randomized space bounded computation, instead of the multiple access randomness concept. Lastly, there is the remaining open problem of <ref> [CNS95] </ref>: can the results for randomized reductions with one-sided error be extended for randomized reductions with two-sided error? It looks like Idea 2 of section 3.1 is not powerful enough to construct a system of equations with a sufficiently high ratio of correct equations such that error correction techniques can be <p> Acknowledgments I would like to thank Ashish Naik for explaining the results of <ref> [CNS95] </ref>, and both Lance Fortnow and Ashish Naik for helpful discussions and encouragement.

Reference-contexts: CVP is complete for P under logspace many-one reductions. Hence, it suffices to prove that CVP is in (R)L to establish that P (R)L.

Reference-contexts: The research on this problem was initiated by Hartmanis. While studying logspace isomorphisms between P-complete languages, he conjectured that there are no sparse P-complete sets [Har78]. Following significant progress made by Ogihara [Ogi95], the conjecture was recently settled by Cai and Sivakumar <ref> [CS95] </ref>: There is a sparse hard set for P under many-one reductions iff P = L. Cai, Naik and Sivakumar next considered truth-table reductions. <p> Since CVP for parity circuits is in DSPACE [log 2 n], cycling through all possible assignments to the O (log 2 n) gates in G yields a DSPACE [log 2 n] enumerable witness set W for CVP, whence a DSPACE [log 2 n] algorithm for CVP. Cai and Sivakumar <ref> [CS95] </ref> also use the language L 1 , but view (2) as the linear equation m X y j g j = b (4) over Z 2 in the gate values g 1 ; : : : ; g m , and try to set up a system of such equations <p> Fact 4 An m fi m Vandermonde system of full rank over the field F can be solved in NC 1 (m + log jFj) <ref> [CS95] </ref>. If r = log jFj is sufficiently large, Property 4 guarantees that for at least one pair (u fl ; v fl ) 2 F the set contains at least m generators, and f (&lt; C; x; 1 r ; u fl ; v fl &gt;) 2 S. <p> Since Cai, Naik and Sivakumar prove that a polynomial sized sample Y suffices to obtain rank m O (log m) with high probability, the strategy of <ref> [CS95] </ref> discussed above allows them to solve CVP in RNC 2 . <p> They show that otherwise, the NC 2 approach of <ref> [CS95] </ref> works. In no case 3 they make use of Fact 4, which is essential for our construction. 3.2 Formal Proof of the Generic Theorem First we will show in Lemma 1 that Idea 2 does indeed offer a way to construct a valid witness for positive instances of CVP. <p> The first m of them are supposedly the values of the corresponding gate of C on input x. We use the logspace uniform family of bounded fan-in Boolean circuits of size O (poly (m; jFj)) and depth O (log m + log jFj) constructed in <ref> [CS95] </ref> to implement these modules. * Each of the h solution checkers of level 4 is a simple circuit of size poly (n) and depth O (log n). * Level 5 is an OR-tree of size O (h) and depth O (log h). <p> Moreover, if (n) 2 O (log n) and the reductions are computable in NC 1 , then P = NC 1 . Proof (Sketch) It is argued in <ref> [CS95] </ref> that L 2 2 P, and it is straightforward to check that under the given conditions, Theorem 2 can be used (by slightly modifying r, k, and s) to show that CVP 2 DSPACE [(n)].

While studying logspace isomorphisms between P-complete languages, he conjectured that there are no sparse P-complete sets [Har78]. <p> We obtain this result as an instance of a generic theorem analogous to the one for NP in <ref> [HL94] </ref>, which allows to vary the sparseness condition of the hypothesis, and the resource bounds as well as the bound on the number of queries of the truth-table reduction. The construction in the proof is less complicated than in [CNS95]. <p> It is straightforward to check that the family is logspace uniform. 2 We observe that the right-hand side of condition (17) is remarkably similar to the bound on the number of witness intervals that have to kept track of in the proof in <ref> [HL94] </ref> that the existence of a sparse hard set for NP under polynomial-time bounded truth-table reductions implies that NP P. Using our notation, that bound reads n 4 k (n) (c S (s (n)) + 1) k (n) (k (n) + 1)!. <p> This contrasts with the analogous theorem for the sparse hard set problem for NP in <ref> [HL94] </ref>, which also gives the conclusion P = NP assuming the existence of a polylogarithmically dense hard set for NP under polynomial-time truth-table reductions with some non-constant bound on the number of queries (namely O ( log n log log n )).
