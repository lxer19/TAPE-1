Title: A Statistical Approach to Anaphora Resolution  
Author: Niyu Ge, John Hale and Eugene Charniak 
Affiliation: Dept. of Computer Science, Brown University,  
Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for identifying pronominal anaphora and two experiments based upon this algorithm. We incorporate multiple anaphora resolution factors into a statistical framework | specifically the distance between the pronoun and the proposed antecedent, gender/number/animaticity of the proposed antecedent, governing head information and noun phrase repetition. We combine them into a single probability that enables us to identify the referent. Our first experiment shows the relative contribution of each source of information and demonstrates a success rate of 82.9% for all sources combined. The second experiment investigates a method for unsupervised learning of gender/number/animaticity information. We present some experiments illustrating the accuracy of the method and note that with this information added, our pronoun resolution method achieves 84.2% accuracy.

Reference-contexts: The method described here is based on simply counting co-occurrences of pronouns and noun phrases, and thus can employ any method of analysis of the text stream that results in referent/pronoun pairs (cf. <ref> (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) </ref> for another application in which no explicit indicators are available in the stream). We present two very simple methods for finding referent/pronoun pairs, and also give an application of a salience statistic that can indicate how confident we should be about the predictions the method makes.
