Reference-contexts: The vertical dashed lines mark the range of the mean plus and minus one standard deviation for this graph (cf. table 1). endlessly, random effects would be compensated and lognormal distribution would likely be achieved. Lognormal distributions are common phenomena in biological statistics <ref> [1] </ref>. They indicate proportional effects of parameter increase. In psychophysics Fechner [9] stated the proportional dependence of differentiation thresholds upon stimulus change. Thus, his Unterschiedsformel (formula of differentiation) uses a logarithmic transformation. In table 1 mean and standard deviation are listed for logarithmized frequency values.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, on base of the used stimulus pattern a specific synergetic network model has been developed by Carmesin [2], [3], [4] and Carmesin and Arndt <ref> [5, submitted] </ref> which successfully corresponds to our empirical findings. 2 Stroboscopic alternative motion Stroboscopic alternative motion (SAM) patterns consist of two groups of spatially seper-ated objects presented alternately, so that two different directions of apparent motion are equally probable to be perceived [21]. <p> The satiation ffiS decays while the system is gouverned by the other order parameter, so that this process is reversible as reflected by the above mentioned RAC [23].

As mentioned above, discontinuous phase transitions go along with a discontinuous change of the amount of energy [11]. <p> Whereas Carmesin's [3], [4] network model for alternative motion includes fluctuations and a local Hebb dynamics that generates the binding of stimuli to percepts. In their companion paper Carmesin and Arndt <ref> [5] </ref> included the satiation principle into the Hebb type network model. In contrast to Carmesins and Arndts conclusions Hock, Kelso and Schoner [15], [30] excluded the satiation principle. <p> Thus, the decrease of the potential barrier between the two order parameters for turning motions would not be concluded from this general theory. As a next task a specific synergetic model on the basis of Carmesin and Arndt <ref> [5] </ref> has to be developed which explains the emergence of percepts out of concrete microscopic physiological parameters. The macroscopic behavior of this model should fit our empirical findings. 6.6 Phase transition diagram The experimental results of one Subject were presented in Fig. 12. <p> The absolute threshold values vary between the Subjects' results, whereas the relative distribution pattern is common as far as the motion phenomena are included. In addition to the general synergetic model a specific synergetic neural network model has been developed by Carmesin and Arndt <ref> [5] </ref> which explains from microscopic processes the emergence of macroscopic phenomena as well as the synergetic potential V (cf. Fig. 5 and 7). In this contribution we introduced a new experimental approach to cognitive phase transitions.

Reference-contexts: These dynamics of cognitive processes may be described in terms of self-organization theories such as Haken's synergetics [11]. In this theoretical context spontaneous alternations of perceived motion directions have been considered as discontinuous phase transitions between the corresponding neuronal attractors <ref> [6] </ref>. Such discontinuous phase transitions are characterized by a sudden change of the system's state undergoing a phase of high instability. The temporal characteristics of discontinuous phase transitions have been studied by Kruse et al. [23], [24]. <p> But even under fixed boundary conditions it is influenced by stochastic forces of it's own dynamics, so-called fluctuations [7], and furthermore the shape of the potential landscape is continuously modified by a time-dependent adaptation process presumably on the level of neuronal activity, which is known as satiation [20], <ref> [6] </ref>. The interdependence of these two processes will be discussed in section 6.3. The satiation-effect is modeled in Fig. 4 as continuous flattening of the potential valley of the systems actual order parameter. <p> F phase transition is delayed. 6.4 Revision of literature about fluctuations and satiation In the present literature some models for the cognition of ambiguous patterns are described, which are based on the principle of either fluctuations or satiation [32]. Ditzinger and Haken <ref> [6] </ref> introduced an attention parameter in a synergetic model of multistable pattern recognition in order to explain the RAC. This parameter depends on neuronal adaptation or fatigue, and they refer to Kohler's satiation principle.

Reference-contexts: During prolonged exposition of such stroboscopic alternative motion (SAM) displays spontaneous reversals of seen motion direction occur which are not determined by the stimulus pattern. These dynamics of cognitive processes may be described in terms of self-organization theories such as Haken's synergetics <ref> [11] </ref>. In this theoretical context spontaneous alternations of perceived motion directions have been considered as discontinuous phase transitions between the corresponding neuronal attractors [6]. Such discontinuous phase transitions are characterized by a sudden change of the system's state undergoing a phase of high instability. <p> Other possibilities of perceptions are described later. 3 Synergetics in cognition research In the following the terms and models of synergetics are used, which were introduced to cognition research by Haken [12] and Haken and Stadler [14]. Haken's synergetics is a self-organization-theory based upon general systems theory and thermodynamics <ref> [11] </ref>. In thermodynamics the dependence of a system's order formation on it's energy potential is examined for various temperatures. The cognitive system may be regarded as an energetically open but informationally closed system. The self-organization of cognitive order formation depends on energetical boundary conditions, such as experimentally controlled stimuli. <p> Also the Ginzburg-Landau-Theory is restricted to phase transitions in equilibrium. Haken refers to the Ginzburg-Landau-Theory in his development of the potential landscape model and generalized the theory to phase transitions far from equilibrium in dependence on various control parameters <ref> [11] </ref>. Whereas in the Ginzburg-Landau-Theory an order parameter represents a final equilibrium with a discrete energy potential, in the potential landscape model an order parameter can also represent a periodic process of energy transformation which on a macroscopic level appears as an ordered state. <p> As mentioned above, discontinuous phase transitions go along with a discontinuous change of the amount of energy <ref> [11] </ref>. In the potential landscape model the ball has to overcome differences of the potential in between variation of the parameter a from a) to g). Below: descending variation of a from g) to a), which are listed from the left to the right. <p> The test results diagram in Fig. 6 of order parameters q v and q h dependent on the parameter a shows incongruent graphs for ascending and descending variation. This effect is called `hysteresis-loop` <ref> [11] </ref>, [15]. The area in between the graphs is a measure of the amount of the hysteresis-effect. With regard to the potential landscape model it is also a measure of the potential difference ffiV between the order parameters and the maximum. (/) aspect ratio (A) variation in OAM. <p> Approaching fi the potential ascents beside this minimum decrease so that their stabilizing impact on the order parameter is minimized. The system's state increasingly fluctuates in the order parameter range of the potential valley, which is empirically well known as `critical fluctuations` <ref> [11] </ref>, [29]. At C = fi the order parameter is maximal instable, because the potential ascents almost vanished in a widespread parameter range. The impact of external and internal forces on the order parameter is maximized. <p> The potentials of order parameters vary together with the control parameter. If the control parameter variation is reversed, no hysteresis-effect occurs between ascending and descending control parameter variation. 3.7 Evolution of higher ordered states In case b) the evolution of order parameters is described as self-organizational process <ref> [11] </ref>, [10]. This process is illustrated in the bifurcation diagram of Fig. 8, where order parameters with potential minima are drawn in dependence of the control parameter. As Stadler and Kruse pointed out, reversals between existing order parameters have to be distinguished from the development of new order parameters [32].

Reference-contexts: The temporal characteristics of discontinuous phase transitions have been studied by Kruse et al. [23], [24]. A well-known criterion of discontinuous phase transitions between two or more attractors is the so-called hysteresis-effect which reflects the stability of the attractors <ref> [15] </ref>. In this study we want to introduce an experimental approach which shifts the focus of interest from investigating discontinuous phase transitions (reversals between stable attractors) to the basic development of attractors during continuous phase transitions. <p> Percepts are regarded as phases characterized by order parameters. During continuous variation of a microscopic control parameter the macroscopic order parameter may change continuously or discontinuously. In case of the OAM Subjects report a sudden change of percepts if the aspect ratio of the visual pattern is varied continuously <ref> [15] </ref>. The different degrees of continuity of phase transitions has been explained by Ginzburg and Landau [25], as will be shown within the potential landscape model. Discontinuous switching of phases occur if the two order parameter values exhibit different potentials. <p> If the control parameter a is varied continuously in one ascending and one descending row, the parameter values a u and a d differ, at which Subjects report a perceptual switch to the alternative (see Fig. 5; cf. [19] and <ref> [15] </ref>). This hysteresis-effect is due to the different change potentials of the order parameters at this discontinuous phase transition. This can be modeled as asymmetrical modification of the potential landscape according to the satiation-effect (cf. Fig. 4). <p> The test results diagram in Fig. 6 of order parameters q v and q h dependent on the parameter a shows incongruent graphs for ascending and descending variation. This effect is called `hysteresis-loop` [11], <ref> [15] </ref>. The area in between the graphs is a measure of the amount of the hysteresis-effect. With regard to the potential landscape model it is also a measure of the potential difference ffiV between the order parameters and the maximum. (/) aspect ratio (A) variation in OAM. <p> This reflects the actual point of cognition research, where e.g. the OAM has been well examined yet under conditions of discontinuous phase transitions [23], [31], <ref> [15] </ref>, [22]. In this article we suggest methods in order to examine SAM under conditions of continuous phase transitions at which new motion phenomena emerge. For that purpose we have to revert to the Ginzburg-Landau-Theory. The terms `order parameter` and `control parameter` designate parameters on different system levels. <p> In their companion paper Carmesin and Arndt [5] included the satiation principle into the Hebb type network model. In contrast to Carmesins and Arndts conclusions Hock, Kelso and Schoner <ref> [15] </ref>, [30] excluded the satiation principle. Their models for SAM just take fluctuations into account. 6.5 Oppositional motions and simultaneity In section 6.1 succession, fluttering motion and turning motions have been modeled in a potential landscape.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Since the foundations of Gestalt psychology by Wertheimer [34] apparent motion has been an important phenomenon in cognition research [27], [28], <ref> [23] </ref>. The evolution of perceived motion from stationary stimuli elucidates the dynamics of perceptual order formation. This is especially the case with multistable stroboscopic motion phenomena that lead to different perceptual interpretations of motion direction [33]. <p> Such discontinuous phase transitions are characterized by a sudden change of the system's state undergoing a phase of high instability. The temporal characteristics of discontinuous phase transitions have been studied by Kruse et al. <ref> [23] </ref>, [24]. A well-known criterion of discontinuous phase transitions between two or more attractors is the so-called hysteresis-effect which reflects the stability of the attractors [15]. <p> Less probable is the perception of clockwise or counter-clockwise motions. The process of continuous reversals is reported at different rates of apparent change (RAC; see Kruse et al. <ref> [23] </ref>). The pattern of Fig. 1 is called orthogonal alternative motion (OAM). Another pattern of SAM is shown in Fig. 2 called circular alternative motion (CAM). The stimuli consist of 20 flashing dots distributed equidistantly on a circle around a fixation dot. <p> The satiation ffiS decays while the system is gouverned by the other order parameter, so that this process is reversible as reflected by the above mentioned RAC <ref> [23] </ref>. The satiation ffiS is represented by the network's ressources ffiW in the model of Carmesin and Arndt [5]. 3.3 Discontinuous phase transitions Phenomenally the phase transition between these two order parameters is experienced as discontinuous switching between alternative percepts. <p> This reflects the actual point of cognition research, where e.g. the OAM has been well examined yet under conditions of discontinuous phase transitions <ref> [23] </ref>, [31], [15], [22]. In this article we suggest methods in order to examine SAM under conditions of continuous phase transitions at which new motion phenomena emerge. For that purpose we have to revert to the Ginzburg-Landau-Theory. The terms `order parameter` and `control parameter` designate parameters on different system levels. <p> increase of the control parameter the evolving fluttering motion percept represents the phase transition between the phases of succession and turning motions. 6.2 Rate of apparent change in fluttering motion In previous experiments the OAM has been examined in a frequency range where one satiation process lasts several period times <ref> [23] </ref>. With regard to our model of CAM we are now able to state the interdependence between the satiation-effect, the RAC, the potential barrier and perceptual multistability. <p> Though the dependence of satiation on the stimulus frequency has not especially been examined with CAM, the results with OAM can be generalized which indicate a proportional increase of ffiS with f <ref> [23] </ref>. From the present empirical findings with CAM we can at least derive that the increase of satiation with frequency is smaller than the increase of the potential difference. <p> In case of turning motions RAC decreases with f . 6.3 The impact of fluctuations and satiation Until so far only the impact of satiation is introduced in the potential landscape model. Furthermore, the experiments with OAM have shown that t r fluctuates in a range <ref> [23] </ref>. Thus, the impact of fluctuations on phase transitions has to be taken into consideration in order to fit the model to the experimental results. The interdependence of satiation and fluctuations with regard to discontinuous phase transitions is modeled in Fig. 13 and 14.

Reference-contexts: Such discontinuous phase transitions are characterized by a sudden change of the system's state undergoing a phase of high instability. The temporal characteristics of discontinuous phase transitions have been studied by Kruse et al. [23], <ref> [24] </ref>. A well-known criterion of discontinuous phase transitions between two or more attractors is the so-called hysteresis-effect which reflects the stability of the attractors [15]. <p> This enables the experimental parameter change in order to examine the conditions of phase transitions in multistable patterns. Therefore the SAM and especially the OAM became a paradigmatical tool for cognition research <ref> [24] </ref>. If the control parameter a is varied continuously in one ascending and one descending row, the parameter values a u and a d differ, at which Subjects report a perceptual switch to the alternative (see Fig. 5; cf. [19] and [15]).

Reference-contexts: In case of the OAM Subjects report a sudden change of percepts if the aspect ratio of the visual pattern is varied continuously [15]. The different degrees of continuity of phase transitions has been explained by Ginzburg and Landau <ref> [25] </ref>, as will be shown within the potential landscape model. Discontinuous switching of phases occur if the two order parameter values exhibit different potentials. Phases are mathematically described using an equation for the potential V for the free energy in dependence of an order parameter q.

Reference-contexts: Approaching fi the potential ascents beside this minimum decrease so that their stabilizing impact on the order parameter is minimized. The system's state increasingly fluctuates in the order parameter range of the potential valley, which is empirically well known as `critical fluctuations` [11], <ref> [29] </ref>. At C = fi the order parameter is maximal instable, because the potential ascents almost vanished in a widespread parameter range. The impact of external and internal forces on the order parameter is maximized. Thus, these are optimal conditions for experimental research, as will be argued later. and ffi.

Reference-contexts: In Fig. 3 the graph of the change potential for a given value ffi of the control parameter C has been depicted in order to model the case of discontinuous phase transitions in OAM <ref> [31] </ref>. The process of order formation may be modeled by the damped motion of a ball on the shape of the potential's graph, which represents the system's state (see Fig. 3). In the potential landscape model the ball is attracted towards minimal change potential by a vertical gravity. <p> This reflects the actual point of cognition research, where e.g. the OAM has been well examined yet under conditions of discontinuous phase transitions [23], <ref> [31] </ref>, [15], [22]. In this article we suggest methods in order to examine SAM under conditions of continuous phase transitions at which new motion phenomena emerge. For that purpose we have to revert to the Ginzburg-Landau-Theory. The terms `order parameter` and `control parameter` designate parameters on different system levels.

Reference-contexts: This process is illustrated in the bifurcation diagram of Fig. 8, where order parameters with potential minima are drawn in dependence of the control parameter. As Stadler and Kruse pointed out, reversals between existing order parameters have to be distinguished from the development of new order parameters <ref> [32] </ref>. We would like to deepen this argumentation. 4 Experimental control parameter change The frequency of a SAM pattern was varied over a widespread range. Subjects were instructed to assign their perceptual experience to given categories. The empirical distribution of the phenomena over the frequency range is highly ordered. <p> F phase transition is delayed. 6.4 Revision of literature about fluctuations and satiation In the present literature some models for the cognition of ambiguous patterns are described, which are based on the principle of either fluctuations or satiation <ref> [32] </ref>. Ditzinger and Haken [6] introduced an attention parameter in a synergetic model of multistable pattern recognition in order to explain the RAC. This parameter depends on neuronal adaptation or fatigue, and they refer to Kohler's satiation principle.

Reference-contexts: The evolution of perceived motion from stationary stimuli elucidates the dynamics of perceptual order formation. This is especially the case with multistable stroboscopic motion phenomena that lead to different perceptual interpretations of motion direction <ref> [33] </ref>. During prolonged exposition of such stroboscopic alternative motion (SAM) displays spontaneous reversals of seen motion direction occur which are not determined by the stimulus pattern. These dynamics of cognitive processes may be described in terms of self-organization theories such as Haken's synergetics [11]. <p> Subjects observing these patterns usually report spontaneous reversals of motion direction. A very simple pattern consists of 2 fl 2 flashing dots which was examined in many variations by von Schiller <ref> [33] </ref> and Hoeth [17], [16]. The dots form the shape of an upright rectangle as shown in fig. 1. The two groups of diagonally opposite dots are flashing alternately for a certain onset interval (OI) with an interstimulus interval (ISI).
