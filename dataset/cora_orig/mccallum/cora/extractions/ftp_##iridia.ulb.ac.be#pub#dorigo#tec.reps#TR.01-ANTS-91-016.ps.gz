Reference-contexts: We believe that, especially if we are interested to design inherently parallel algorithms, observation of natural systems can be an invaluable source of inspiration. Neural networks [17], genetic algorithms [11], evolution strategies [16], immune networks <ref> [1] </ref>, simulated annealing [12] are only some of the proposed models with a "natural flavour".
