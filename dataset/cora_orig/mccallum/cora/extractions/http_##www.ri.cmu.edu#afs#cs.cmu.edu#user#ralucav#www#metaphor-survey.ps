Abstract: This paper surveys some of the important trends of the research on metaphor comprehension in the cognitive science area. We examine the semantic theories of the metaphor, some pros and (mostly) cons of the very challenged error-recovery model of metaphor comprehension. We present Lakoff's view that metaphors are conceptual rather than linguistic phenomena; we discuss how theories of other tropes are consistent with metaphor theories; and finally we talk about some attempts to develop a computational theory of the metaphor.

A. Richards. Black argues that any criterion for "metaphorhood" (i.e. for distinguishing metaphors from other forms of language) is doomed to failure. <p> Each of them should be seen as an "implicative complex", made by beliefs and properties commonly held to be true. Then The metaphorical utterance works by "projecting upon" the primary subject a set of "associated implications" comprised in the implicative complex, that are predicable of the secondary subject ... <ref> [Black 1979] </ref> The metaphorical utterance actually reorganizes and emphasizes the features of the primary subject by "applying to it statements isomorphic with the members of the secondary subject's implicative complex."

[Black 1979]. It is central for the interaction view to remark that such a projection depends strongly on the primary subject, as well as on the secondary subject. The primary subject determines which features of the secondary subject are to be projected by the metaphoric statement. <p> It would be more illuminating in some of these cases (i.e. of metaphors imputing similarities difficult to discern otherwise) to say that the metaphor creates the similarity than to say that it formulates some similarity antecedently existing.

Reference-contexts: In this light, metaphors can be regarded as a cognitive instrument. There are several problems with Lakoff's theory on metaphor. Some of them are discussed in <ref> [Cacciari et al. 1992] </ref>. <p> Metaphors like the one from a newspaper headline referring to a flood in Chicago: City of Broad Shoulders Has Wet Feet <ref> [Cacciari et al. 1992] </ref> is hard to explain. Also, it is not clear how the conceptual metaphoric system is acquired initially or how one realization of a metaphor is chosen over another. <p> Wet Feet <ref> [Cacciari et al. 1992] </ref> is hard to explain. Also, it is not clear how the conceptual metaphoric system is acquired initially or how one realization of a metaphor is chosen over another. Why would people prefer My job is a jail to My job is a traffic jam? [Cacciari et al. 1992]. 7 Computational Models The computational models of metaphor understanding seem to have evolved from the need of the natural language processing systems to integrate the ubiquitous phenomenon of metaphor.

Reference-contexts: That is to say that the metaphor 8 is an analogy which uses a non-explicit mapping of the two domains (because such a mapping is either known or obvious). Carbonell also discusses the comprehension of new metaphors <ref> [Carbonell 1982, Carbonell 1981] </ref>. He considers (in the Lakoff's line) that metaphors are a powerful source of learning. Carbonell investigates the laws that allow us to transfer methods of inference from one domain to another.

Reference-contexts: The attempts to model computationally the metaphor understanding can be split in three classes: the knowledge intensive approaches, which make use of separate lexicon entries for words in the conventional metaphors ([Hirst 1987, Wilenky et al. 1980] cf. [Martin 1992]), the analogy based approaches <ref> [Carbonell 1982, Gentner et al. 1988, Indurkhya 1987] </ref>, which try to use analogy mappings to comprehend metaphors, and the mixed approaches which make use of knowledge of conventional metaphors and try to extend this knowledge to novel metaphors [Martin 1992]. <p> Such a procedure is supported by Carbonell's claim that "the computational process used in understanding analogies is the same as that used in understanding metaphors. The difference is one of recognition and universality of acceptance of the underlying mappings" <ref> [Carbonell 1982] </ref>. That is to say that the metaphor 8 is an analogy which uses a non-explicit mapping of the two domains (because such a mapping is either known or obvious).

Reference-contexts: Gibbs argues that an association between the vehicle and the topic is created and that it is this association that makes possible the understanding of the sentence. In the same line of research devoted to metaphoric referential description, Gerrig <ref> [Gerrig 1989a] </ref> takes the alternative position: he considers that there is no evidence for supporting the claim of an error-recovery based understanding of the metaphoric referential descriptions.

Reference-contexts: Before discussing these models (we will continue to call them so in lack of a better term), we shall make a quick overview of the constraints a true computational model of metaphor understanding should satisfy as they were stated by Gerrig <ref> [Gerrig 1989b] </ref>. As we have seen in section 4, there is strong evidence that the process of metaphor understanding is not an error-recovery one: people do not seem to try metaphoric understanding of an utterance only when its literal meaning is defective. <p> This result has been reflected in the similar processing times for metaphorical and literal understanding. Therefore, "the consequence for the authors of computational models of metaphor is that they are not licensed to hypothesize processes that would require elongated comprehension times for metaphors" <ref> [Gerrig 1989b] </ref> (the total time constraint). As Gerrig points out, this constraint does not imply that the two processes of comprehension are identical they might be different but still take the same total time. <p> that two different theories might explain the time-limited comprehension (of conventional, every day metaphors) and the leisurely comprehension (of particularly elegant poetic metaphors). "What becomes critical in developing a computational theory is for the author to make a claim about which of these two types of comprehension are being modelled" <ref> [Gerrig 1989b] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, it has been shown that indirect sentences that fit the context (e.g. Can you close the window? in a context where the window is open) do not take longer to understand than literal requests <ref> [Gibbs 1979] </ref>. If the context is not supporting a nonliteral interpretation (i.e the window is closed, for instance), the comprehension is the longest. If no context is presented at all, indirect requests are longer to understand than literal ones.

Reference-contexts: The studies that support the 3-stage theory are not very many and for most of them the design of the experiment seems questionable. One more recent study, however, is particularly interesting <ref> [Gibbs 1990] </ref>. <p> We won't dwell too much on metonimy. Some of the experiments we have discussed about in section 4 were carried for metonimies too (e.g. <ref> [Gibbs 1990] </ref>). In general, the data for metonimies parallel the data for metaphors. There is no evidence that processing of this trope is different from the processing of the metaphor. Searle tries to account for irony and indirect speech in the same way he accounts for metaphor [Searle 1979].

Reference-contexts: It appears that people are biased to comprehend the nonliteral meaning of indirect speech, if it occurs in appropriate context. It is not the case that both the literal and nonliteral meanings are retrieved in parallel <ref> [Gibbs 1983] </ref>. As for idioms, it seems there is a bias to perceive their nonliteral meanings. The reason might be the existence of a special entry in our mental lexicon for each idiom.

Reference-contexts: They are based on the classical view on metaphors whose roots can be traced back to Aristotle. Some of the comparison theories consider objects represented as sets of features. Tversky's contrast theory <ref> [Tversky 1977, Glucksberg et al. 1990] </ref> regards a comparison of the type a is like b as concerning only some relevant features of the two objects. <p> This is due to selecting from the "commonplaces" related to wolves those that can apply to men and in this way impoverishing the implicative concept of wolves. A final quote from Black will allow us to introduce the class inclusion theory of the metaphors, due to Glucksberg and Keysar <ref> [Glucksberg et al. 1990] </ref>. It would be more illuminating in some of these cases (i.e. of metaphors imputing similarities difficult to discern otherwise) to say that the metaphor creates the similarity than to say that it formulates some similarity antecedently existing. [Black 1962], cf. [Black 1979]. <p> We can locate the attempt to regard metaphors as class inclusion statements <ref> [Glucksberg et al. 1990] </ref> in same the line as Black's interaction theory. According to these authors, the source of the 3 metaphor stands for the prototype of an ad-hoc created superordinate category that includes both the source and the target and whose features these terms of the metaphor determined. <p> The practice of naming categories by their prototype is met in a lot of cultures (for instance, the word for "eagle" is used by Shoshoni speakers to refer to large birds in general <ref> [Glucksberg et al. 1990] </ref>). The centrality of the prototype chosen as vehicle would dictate the degree of metaphoricity of a metaphor and also its comprehensibility. The context, together with the topic, plays a very important part in the definition of the new superordinate category.

Reference-contexts: The attempts to model computationally the metaphor understanding can be split in three classes: the knowledge intensive approaches, which make use of separate lexicon entries for words in the conventional metaphors ([Hirst 1987, Wilenky et al. 1980] cf. [Martin 1992]), the analogy based approaches <ref> [Carbonell 1982, Gentner et al. 1988, Indurkhya 1987] </ref>, which try to use analogy mappings to comprehend metaphors, and the mixed approaches which make use of knowledge of conventional metaphors and try to extend this knowledge to novel metaphors [Martin 1992]. <p> The largest of these matches is considered as a possible interpretation of the analogy (metaphor). Indurkhya formalizes mathematically a constrained semantic transference theory starting from Gentner's structure mapping ideas <ref> [Indurkhya 1987] </ref>. He shows how it is possible to associate the T-MAPS from his theory with one metaphorical interpretation of a set of sentences. The T-MAPS are basically mathematical mappings that preserve the structure of the source domain onto the target domain.

Reference-contexts: However, in cases where little contextual support had been provided, metaphors take longer to understand that literal sentences. Ortony concludes that metaphor comprehension involves the same sort of process as literal sentence comprehension. Starting from this type of result, Inhoff <ref> [Inhoff et al. 1984] </ref> speculated that the context encourages a processing strategy, not a given meaning. According to this theory, there are processing strategies, not separate processing stages.

Reference-contexts: There is a famous paper of Reddy [Reddy 1979] that shows how our beliefs about language and communication are a consequence of the conduit metaphor which is often used by the English speakers when they talk about language. Lakoff <ref> [Lakoff 1992, Lakoff et al. 1980] </ref> extends the class of "cultural metaphors" and supports this idea with lots of evidence. It is often the case that metaphors help us grasp abstract concepts by expressing them in terms of more concrete notions. <p> The literal meaning 6 may not be processed at all during comprehension 6 Metaphors As Conceptual Phenomena Starting from an idea introduced by Reddy's 1979 paper [Reddy 1979], Lakoff <ref> [Lakoff 1992, Lakoff et al. 1980] </ref> claims that metaphors happen not at the language level, but rather at the thought level - "they are general mappings across conceptual domains." A metaphorical expression is a "surface realization" of a cross-domain mapping. Lakoff uses small caps to denote such a (metalinguistic) mapping. <p> The prices rose as a realization of more is up etc.). They obey the Invariance Principle: "The image-schema structure of the source domain is projected onto the target domain in a way that is consistent with the inherent target domain structure" <ref> [Lakoff 1992] </ref>. The metaphorical mappings originate in the every day knowledge and experience. They vary in universality: some are met in most cultures, other are rarer. Although conceptual metaphors are pervasive, Lakoff argues that this does not imply that everything is metaphorical: "Metaphorical understanding is grounded in nonmetaphorical understanding."

Although conceptual metaphors are pervasive, Lakoff argues that this does not imply that everything is metaphorical: "Metaphorical understanding is grounded in nonmetaphorical understanding." [Lakoff 1992]. For instance, our knowledge of the three dimensional space is nonmetaphorical. This concrete conception about space helps us represent and understand the more abstract concept of time (e.g. the past is behind us, the future in front etc.).

We shall overview some of the analogy-based methods and a mixed approach due to Martin. 7.1 Analogy-Based Models Carbonell proposes a model of metaphor understanding starting from Lakoff's idea of a basic system of conceptual metaphors. <p> He also gives some algorithms for generating the T-MAPS attached to a metaphorical interpretation. 7.2 Mixed Models Martin's MIDAS system <ref> [Martin 1992] </ref> is an attempt to fuse the advantages of the knowledge base approach and of the analogy based approach. Lakoff's claim of a basic set of conventional metaphors leads Martin to build a knowledge base of such metaphors to be used by Midas.

Reference-contexts: The entries are compiled by hand from the published metaphor literature and from a series of graduate seminars held at University of California at Berkeley. They contain the metaphorical mapping and metaphorical realizations for each metaphor. Martin <ref> [Martin 1994] </ref> proposes "an empirically derived and theoretically motivated knowledge base of English metaphorical conventions." In his paper, he shows how such a knowledge base could be actually built with metaphors described in the Ortolingua representation language.

Reference-contexts: For instance, they think that Her cheeks were red like a rose is less metaphorical (or a worse metaphor) than Her cheeks were like a rose. The problem with the contrast theory is that it doesn't explain for the difference in the degrees of metaphoricity between. Ortony <ref> [Ortony 1979a] </ref> overcomes such difficulties by modifying Tversky's theory to include the notion of salience imbalance.

Reference-contexts: Rumelhart emphasizes that figurative language understanding, like literal language understanding, is dependent on general knowledge of the world rather than on the acquisition of some special skill. This claim is repeated in the Ortony's paper <ref> [Ortony 1978] </ref>. Ortony built an experiment in which subjects were presented metaphorical sentences preceded by either a context encouraging a literal interpretation or a context encouraging a metaphorical one. He varied also the length of the context. <p> Such a claim is supported by the difficulty second language learners experience in learning idioms: most of the time they must give up a logical, translatable and inferable interpretation and learn them by heart. Ortony's 1978 influential experiment for metaphors was done for idiomatic expressions, too <ref> [Ortony 1978] </ref>. Subjects took longer to understand the literal meaning of an idiom when preceded by a context that supported this meaning (e.g.

Rumelhart claimed that the distinction between the literal and the figurative meaning is not reflected in a quantitative change in the psychological process 4 <ref> [Rumelhart 1979] </ref>. His principal argument comes from looking at how children acquire and use metaphoric language. It seems that this process parallels the one of literal language acquisition; no special difficulties are encountered.

Reference-contexts: The categorization is the one that produces the similarity. 3.3 The Incoherence (3-Stage, Error-Recovery) Theory The incoherence view is due to Searle <ref> [Searle 1979] </ref>. Since it is easier to be psychologically tested than the other semantic theories, it has actually been contested by a wide range of experiments in the 80s. We shall talk about some of these experiments in section 4. <p> In general, the data for metonimies parallel the data for metaphors. There is no evidence that processing of this trope is different from the processing of the metaphor. Searle tries to account for irony and indirect speech in the same way he accounts for metaphor <ref> [Searle 1979] </ref>. He assumes he who utters an ironical sentence means the opposite of what the literal interpretation of that sentence would say.

Reference-contexts: They are based on the classical view on metaphors whose roots can be traced back to Aristotle. Some of the comparison theories consider objects represented as sets of features. Tversky's contrast theory <ref> [Tversky 1977, Glucksberg et al. 1990] </ref> regards a comparison of the type a is like b as concerning only some relevant features of the two objects.
