Abstract: Is there an NP function that, when given a satisfiable formula as input, outputs one satisfying assignment uniquely? That is, can a nondeterministic function cull just one satisfying assignment from a possibly exponentially large collection of assignments? We show that if there is such a nondeterministic function, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to ZPP NP (and thus, in particular, to NP NP ). As the existence of such a function is known to be equivalent to the statement "every NP function has an NP refinement with unique outputs," our result provides the strongest evidence yet that NP functions cannot be refined. We prove our result via a result of independent interest. We say that a set A is NPSV-selective (NPMV-selective) if there is a 2-ary partial NP function with unique values (a 2-ary partial NP function) that decides which of its inputs (if any) is "more likely" to belong to A; this is a nondeterministic analog of the recursion-theoretic notion of the semi-recursive sets and the extant complexity-theoretic notion of P-selectivity. Our hierarchy collapse result follows by combining the easy observation that every set in NP is NPMV-selective with the following result: If A 2 NP is NPSV-selective, then A 2 (NP " coNP)=poly. Relatedly, we prove that if A 2 NP is NPSV-selective, then A is Low 2 . We prove that the polynomial hierarchy collapses even further, namely to NP, if all coNP sets are NPMV-selective. This follows from a more general result we prove: Every self-reducible NPMV-selective set is in NP. fl Dept. of Computer Science, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627, USA.

Reference-contexts: In any case, in terms of the standard levels of extended lowness|ExtendedLow 1 , ExtendedLow 2 , ExtendedLow 3 , ...|our ExtendedLow 3 result is optimal, as Allender and Hemaspaandra <ref> [3] </ref> have noted that even P/poly is not in ExtendedLow 2 . We defer the proof of Theorem 3.4 to the end of this section. Theorem 3.4 (NP=poly) T (coNP=poly) is ExtendedLow 3 . From Theorems 3.3 and 3.4, we immediately obtain the following corollary.

Reference-contexts: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in selective sets, and advances have catalyzed further advances (see the survey <ref> [9] </ref>). In this paper, we extend the notion of selectivity, in the natural way, to functions that may be partial and/or multivalued. Important function classes of these sorts are the single-valued partial NP functions (NPSV), the multivalued partial NP functions (NPMV), and the multivalued total NP functions (NPMV t ).

Finally, we define "promise problems" <ref> [10] </ref> corresponding to selectivity. Informally, a solution to the promise problem PP-A [37,28] will|if the promise is met that exactly one of x and y is in A|contain hx; yi exactly if x 2 A.

Reference-contexts: We will be particularly interested in the advice classes NP=poly, coNP=poly, and (NP coNP)=poly. It is not known whether NP=poly T coNP=poly = (NP T coNP)=poly, though Fenner et al. <ref> [11] </ref> have constructed an oracle relative to which the classes differ (see also the structural results of [14]). 4 Next we define lowness and extended lowness.

Reference-contexts: Selman ([38], see also <ref> [12] </ref>) raised a related question that may be equally compelling, as he showed that a resolution would provide insight into the invertibility of honest polynomial-time functions, and into the relationship between single-valued and multivalued functions. He asked whether the following hypothesis is true. <p> Hypothesis 1.1 There is a single-valued NP function f such that for each formula F 2 SAT, f (F ) is a satisfying assignment of F . Clearly, Hypothesis 1.1 is true if NP = coNP. However, as both Fenner et al. <ref> [12] </ref> and Selman [38] suspected that Hypothesis 1.1 fails, perhaps a more interesting issue is that of the evidential weight in that direction. In fact, little is currently known to indicate that Hypothesis 1.1 fails.

Reference-contexts: It follows easily that Hypothesis 1.1 implies this same collapse. Result (??) is proven via the following result, which is of interest in its own right. (1) The NPSV-selective sets in NP are in (NP T coNP)=poly. (NP coNP)=poly is the class of sets (see <ref> [14] </ref>) accepted, aided by a small amount of "advice," by machines that robustly behave as NP T coNP machines. We also prove the following related result. (2) The NPSV-selective sets in NP are Low 2 . That is, for each such set A, NP NP A = NP NP . <p> We will be particularly interested in the advice classes NP=poly, coNP=poly, and (NP coNP)=poly. It is not known whether NP=poly T coNP=poly = (NP T coNP)=poly, though Fenner et al. [11] have constructed an oracle relative to which the classes differ (see also the structural results of <ref> [14] </ref>). 4 Next we define lowness and extended lowness.

We prove, as Theorem 4.3 below, a similar result for self-reducible NPMV-selective sets, and apply this result to PSPACE and the levels of the polynomial hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: Sets selective with respect to deterministic polynomial-time selector functions were introduced by Selman [36], and are called the P-selective sets; sets selective with respect to single-valued total NP functions were introduced and studied by Hemaspaandra et al. <ref> [19] </ref>. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in selective sets, and advances have catalyzed further advances (see the survey [9]). In this paper, we extend the notion of selectivity, in the natural way, to functions that may be partial and/or multivalued. <p> This will allow us to establish that the NPSV-selective sets in NP have lowness and advice class results just as strong as those shown by <ref> [19] </ref> for the NPSV t -selective sets in NP.

Reference-contexts: Selectivity is a notion of generalized membership testing; selective sets have functions choosing which of any two input elements is the "more likely" to be in the set. Sets selective with respect to recursive selector functions were introduced by Jockush <ref> [20] </ref>, and are called the semirecursive sets. Sets selective with respect to deterministic polynomial-time selector functions were introduced by Selman [36], and are called the P-selective sets; sets selective with respect to single-valued total NP functions were introduced and studied by Hemaspaandra et al. [19].

Reference-contexts: We observe (Proposition 3.1) that Hypothesis 1.1 holds if and only if SAT is NPSV-selective. Karp and Lipton introduced the following notion of being computable in a class supplemented by a small amount of extra information. Definition 2.3 <ref> [21] </ref> For any class of sets C, C=poly denotes the class of sets L for which there exist a set A 2 C and a polynomially length-bounded function h : fl ! fl such that for every x, it holds that x 2 L if and only if hx; h (0 <p> This proves the theorem. Note that every NP set is NPMV-selective. Is this also true for NPSV-selectivity? We have the following result. Theorem 3.9 If NP NPSV-sel, then ZPP NP = PH. 9 Proof of Theorem 3.9 This is a corollary of Theorem 3.2, since, extending Karp and Lipton <ref> [21] </ref>, Kobler and Watanabe have proven that if NP (NP T coNP)=poly ) ZPP NP = PH [24]. Note that we could conclude immediately from Corollary 3.8 the slightly weaker result that if NP NPSV-sel, then NP NP = PH.

Reference-contexts: We now turn to this study, emphasizing the NPSV-selective sets. Clearly, NPMV-sel (and thus NPSV-sel) is contained in NP=poly, and NPMV t -sel is contained in NP=poly T coNP=poly, via using a standard divide-and-conquer approach to find an appropriate advice set, similar to the approach in Ko's proof <ref> [22] </ref> that the P-selective sets are in P=poly (see also the proofs of Theorem 3.2 and Theorem 3.7). <p> As in the case of Ko's proof that the P-selective sets are in P=poly <ref> [22] </ref>, we may repeatedly choose to add to S some element of A n that loses to at least half the elements that both are not yet in S and don't yet beat some element in S, where by "x loses to y" we mean that set-f (x; y) = fyg.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 3.3 is a specific case of this more general claim. The polynomial time-bound on the disjunctive reduction in the general claim can be replaced by a logspace bound if the pairing function used (in the definition of advice classes) is logspace invertible. Kobler <ref> [23] </ref> has shown that (NP T coNP)=poly is ExtendedLowfi 3 . An interesting question left open by Kobler's paper is whether (NP=poly) T (coNP=poly) is extended low. We resolve this issue by showing that it is.

But what about function classes between FP and FP NP ? In this paper, we proved that the NPSV functions are unlikely to have the power to find satisfying assignments; they can do so only if the polynomial hierarchy collapses to ZPP NP .

The totality of current evidence seems to be the fact that Hypothesis 1.1 fails relative to a random oracle <ref> [33] </ref>, and the result of Selman [38] that if Hypothesis 1.1 holds, then there are two disjoint NP-Turing-complete sets such that every set that separates them is NP-hard. <p> The main result of the present paper does not similarly imply 14 that the polynomial hierarchy collapses relative to a random oracle, as Hypothesis 1.1 is known to fail relative to a random oracle <ref> [33] </ref>. Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank S. Biswas, H. Buhrman, L. Fortnow, Y. Han, E. Hemaspaandra, and M. Zimand for many helpful comments and suggestions.

Reference-contexts: It is not known whether NP=poly T coNP=poly = (NP T coNP)=poly, though Fenner et al. [11] have constructed an oracle relative to which the classes differ (see also the structural results of [14]). 4 Next we define lowness and extended lowness.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, with one question to an NP SATH set E 00 (defined analogously), we determine whether the "s" advice collection is good for helping S 2 . 10 Note that when given the correct advice strings, an NP machine can strongly (in the sense of Long [26] and Selman <ref> [35] </ref>) check whether x 2 H or x 62 H, by nondeterministically guessing which is true and checking an x 2 H guess via checking whether hx; r jxj i 2 S 1 , and checking an x 62 H guess via checking whether hx; s jxj i 2 S 2

Selman ([38], see also [12]) raised a related question that may be equally compelling, as he showed that a resolution would provide insight into the invertibility of honest polynomial-time functions, and into the relationship between single-valued and multivalued functions.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Valiant and Vazirani's <ref> [42] </ref> result that, in their words, "NP is as easy as detecting unique solutions," has rightly been the focus of great attention.

Reference-contexts: In particular, our result that "NPMV has NPSV refinements only if ZPP NP = PH" itself relativizes. However, any relativizable proof of "Hypothesis 5.1 implies a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy" would immediately imply|due to the result of Watanabe and Toda <ref> [43] </ref> that Hypothesis 5.1 holds relative to a random oracle|that the polynomial hierarchy collapses relative to a random oracle. Furthermore, if the polynomial hierarchy collapses relative to a random oracle, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses ([5], see also [32]).

Reference-contexts: We conclude, via the extended low ness of NP=poly T coNP=poly (Theorem 3.4) and the lowness of NP=poly T coNP=poly T coNP=poly T NP <ref> [44] </ref>, that NPMV t -sel is ExtendedLow 3 and that NPMV t -sel T now turn towards our main result. Theorem 3.2 NPSV-sel T T coNP)=poly. In the introduction, we mentioned that the key thing our proofs do is to achieve, even with the partial functions, the effect of totality.
