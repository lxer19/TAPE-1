Abstract: This paper presents a technique to provide seamless communications in mobile wireless networks. The goal of seamless communication is to provide disruption free service to a mobile user. A disruption in service could occur due to active handoffs (handoffs during an active connection). Existing protocols either provide total guarantee for disruption free service incurring heavy network bandwidth usage (multicast based approach), or do not provide any guarantee for disruption free service (forwarding approach). There are many user applications that do not require a "total" guarantee for disruption free service but would also not tolerate very frequent disruptions. This paper proposes a novel staggered multicast approach which provides a probabilistic guarantee for disruption free service. The main advantage of the staggered multicast approach is that it exploits the performance guarantees provided by the multicast approach and also provides the much required savings in the static network bandwidth. The problem of guaranteeing disruption free service to mobile users becomes more acute when the static backbone network does not use any packet numbering or does not provide retrans-missions. Asynchronous Transfer Mode networks, the future of B-ISDN, display these properties. To make our study complete, we present a possible implementation of our scheme for wireless ATM networks. fl Initial Version of this paper was submitted to Mobile Computing and Networking - MCN'95, in April, 1995.

Reference-contexts: Their solutions lay excellent groundwork for work in this area but did not guarantee disruption free service. In fact their scheme was shown to suffer from extended intervals of time when service to the mobile host was disrupted. A study done in <ref> [1] </ref> shows that if the handoff protocol required forwarding data between the BSs connected by physical links, then a high bandwidth (between 48Mbps and 96Mbps) is required just to forward these data packets. Moreover, loops can be formed in the connection path if forwarding is employed. <p> Moreover, loops can be formed in the connection path if forwarding is employed. This will lead to inefficient network utilization. A multicast based solution was proposed in <ref> [1] </ref>. In this approach, the data packets for a mobile host are multicast to the BSs of the neighboring cells so that when the host moves to a new cell, there are data packets already waiting for it and thus, there is no break in service. <p> It is evident, however, that this scheme is not cost effective. As the number of users in the network increases, the amount of network bandwidth used up by the multicast connections is going be prohibitively high. In <ref> [1] </ref>, the cost of such a multicast scheme was determined to be the buffer overhead at the BSs. <p> The overhead of such a staggered scheme can be determined using multicast mode for the user. In a traditional multicast based solution for disruption free service, the network spends 100% of the connection time in multicast mode <ref> [1] </ref>. Comparing it to the traditional multicast based solutions, there is a 50% savings in network bandwidth. Suppose on the other hand, a user is maintaining a critical connection which demands total guarantee of disruption free service, i.e., the QOS demanded by the user is 100 %. <p> The group members for a mobile host can be determined based on some hints (direction, velocity). If no hints are available, the default multicast group members will be the neighboring base stations <ref> [1] </ref>. The connection management problem can be divided into two phases, namely, connection establishment phase and connection maintenance phase. The source mobile host initiates the connection establishment phase by sending a connection request message to its base station. The base station forwards this message to its switch.

Reference-contexts: The basic idea behind our scheme is presented in section 3. Section 4 presents the issues related to implementation of the proposed approach using ATM as the backbone network. Concluding remarks are presented in section 5. 2 Related Literature Keeton et.al. in <ref> [2] </ref> proposed a set of algorithms to provide connection oriented network services to mobile hosts for real time applications like multimedia. Their solutions lay excellent groundwork for work in this area but did not guarantee disruption free service. <p> While doing so it takes into account the network load so as to balance the load on each network node. in an environment where handoffs are frequent and require excessive interaction with a base station an inherent problem associated with the work in <ref> [2] </ref>. To alleviate this problem, the authors in [3] proposed a new network architecture which made use of virtual circuit trees to minimize handoff processing. However, it does not discuss about providing disruption free service when a handoff takes place the mainstay of applications like multimedia [23]. <p> In this model the mobile user is assumed to be moving at an average velocity of V .

Reference-contexts: This argument is supported by the availability of cheap memory but expensive network bandwidth 2 . As pointed out in <ref> [3] </ref>, the network call processor 3 in a static network becomes the bottleneck 2 The cost of a 30 minute call from USA to Japan is approximately equal to the cost of 1 Mbyte of RAM. 3 The role of the network call processor is to establish a path or route <p> To alleviate this problem, the authors in <ref> [3] </ref> proposed a new network architecture which made use of virtual circuit trees to minimize handoff processing.

Reference-contexts: This model is similar to the one proposed in <ref> [4] </ref>. Figure 8 shows ATM switches connected to base stations which in turn provide service to the mobile hosts. <p> Of course, special cells may be generated by setting the appropriate bits in their headers, but this is not the case with data cells in particular. Extensions to existing ATM protocols to suit the mobile environment are discussed in <ref> [4] </ref>. However, our solution does not require any changes in existing protocols but targets ATM switch fabrics to achieve its goals.

Reference-contexts: This mobility model represents the class of users who spend a lot of time in a cell. 3.2.2 Pessimistic Model The pessimistic model is based on the mobility model proposed in <ref> [5] </ref>. In this model the mobile user is assumed to be moving at an average velocity of V . The direction of movement is uniformly distributed over [0; 2]. The mobile users are assumed to be uniformly distributed over the cell area with a density of . <p> For circular cells, L will correspond to the perimeter of a cell, and thus L S = 2 R . It follows that the average cell latency of a mobile user is given R 2V . As in <ref> [5] </ref>, we will assume that the cell latency of a mobile user is exponentially distributed with a mean R 2V . 3.3 Performance Analysis of the Staggered Multicast Approach The overhead of the staggered multicast scheme can be characterized by the total time T m spent in the multicast mode as <p> The mobility model for this part was same as the mobility model proposed in <ref> [5] </ref>. The radius of the circular cell R was varied from 10m to 50m. The time of connection T c , was fixed to be 100 minutes. The average velocity V was chosen to be 1.6 m/s (approx 5.7 km/hr, for a pedestrian user).

Reference-contexts: Implementation of our scheme will require minor modifications at the switch level. We would require the mobile host to maintain some kind of a record of the last frame number correctly received from a base station. A representative switch fabric that supports multicast (broadcast) <ref> [21] </ref> is shown in Figure 14. The modifications proposed to this switch architecture, however, are general enough to be applied to any other existing architecture. Our purpose is only to demonstrate how our scheme can be implemented.
