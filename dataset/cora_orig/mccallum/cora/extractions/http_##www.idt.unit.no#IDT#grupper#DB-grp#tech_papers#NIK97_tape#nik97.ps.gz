Abstract: Traditionally, digital tape has been used by applications accessing the tape mostly sequentially. Applications having a random access pattern to the data are much better off storing the data on magnetic disks. Today we see new application areas, where the need for huge amounts of digital storage does not make it cost-effective to store all the data on magnetic disk. One example of such an application is digital video archives. In this paper, we present an access model for a Tandberg MLR1 serpentine tape drive. For such a drive, there is no direct relation between the logical block address and the corresponding physical position on the tape. This makes it difficult to optimize the usage of the tape drive when we have concurrent accesses to the tape. The paper presents a generic model of a serpentine tape drive together with several algorithms for characterizing individual tapes to improve the accuracy of the model. Based on measurements using the MLR1 tape drive the generic model is improved. This extended model makes it possible to estimate seek times with an average error of about two seconds.

Reference-contexts: The first is helical-scan, where the tape drive writes vertical (Figure 1a) or diagonal (Figure 1b) tracks on the tape. The other main technology group is called linear, where the data is written in parallel tracks along the direction of the tape <ref> [1] </ref>. 268 2.1 Helical-scan Several standards use helical-scan technology. The most well known are 4mm (DAT) and 8mm (video). The popular analog VHS video cassettes also uses helical-scan technology. Tapes using this technology usually obtains high data densities and high transfer rates.

Reference-contexts: Section 7 contains the conclusions and outline some further work. 1.1 Related Work A lot of work has been done on modeling and scheduling of accesses on magnetic disks. Not very much has been done on scheduling random accesses on digital tape. Hillyer and Silberschatz <ref> [3] </ref> presents a detailed model of DLT 4000 tapes. Based on this model they have developed and tested several scheduling algorithms [4]. <p> In <ref> [3] </ref> this function is called locate time (src, dst). 1 MLR is short for Multi-channel Linear Recording. 269 To determine this model we have run several experiments using the MLR1. Before we started the experiments we filled the tapes with fixed length logical data blocks. Each logical block was 32kB. <p> Figure 3 indicates that the tape drive uses a set of predetermined points to decide where to stop the seek in forward direction and start seeking in the opposite direction. These points corresponds to the first block in each sawtooth. Hillyer and Silberschatz <ref> [3] </ref> experienced similar sawtooth patterns for the DLT 4000 drive. They defined the points where the seek time has a big dip from one sawtooth to the next as the key points of the tape. But opposite what we found, they also experienced sawtooth patterns along the forward track.

Reference-contexts: As a result, today digital tape is mostly used as a storage medium for backup and distribution, and in applications which need to store really huge amounts of measurement data. One example is NASA's EOSDIS project which will generate more than a terabyte of earth science data per day <ref> [7] </ref>. The main advantages of digital tape compared to magnetic disks are cost and storage density. For magnetic disks, the cost of the medium is about 1 NOK per MB, while for digital tape, the cost of the medium is about 0.05 NOK per MB.
