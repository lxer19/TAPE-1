Title: Abstract  
Abstract: A new, timedomain, non-Monte Carlo method for computer simulation of electrical noise in nonlinear dynamic cir cuits with arbitrary excitations is presented. This timedomain noise simulation method is based on the results from the theory of stochastic differential equations. The noise simulation method is general in the sense that any nonlinear dynamic circuit with any kind of excitation , which can be simulated by the transient analysis routine in a circuit simulator, can be simulated by our noise simulator in timedomain to produce the noise variances and covariances of circuit variables as a function of time, provided that noise models for the devices in the circuit are available. Noise correlations between circuit variables at different time points can also be calculated. Previous work on computer simulation of noise in integrated circuits is reviewed with comparisons to our method. Shot, thermal and icker noise models for integrated-circuit devices, in the context of our time-domain noise simulation method, are described. The implementation of this noise simulation method in a circuit simulator (SPICE) is described. Two examples of noise simulation (a CMOS ring-oscillator and a BJT active mixer) are given.

Reference-contexts: The existence of noise is basically due to the fact that electrical char ge is not continuous but is carried in discrete amounts equal to the electron char ge. Electrical noise is associated with fundamental processes in integrated-circuit devices <ref> [1] </ref>. Noise represents a lower limit to the size of electrical signal that can be amplified by a circuit without significant deterioration in signal quantity . <p> It also results in an upper limit to the useful gain of an amplifier, because if the gain is increased without limit, the output stages of the circuit will eventually begin to cut of f or saturate on the amplified noise from the input stages <ref> [1] </ref>. The inuence of noise on the performance is not limited to amplifier circuits. For instance, active integrated mixer circuits, which are widely used for down conversion in UHF and microwave receivers, add noise to their output. <p> T wo examples of noise simulation are presented in Section 6. Finally , future work is stated in Section 7. 2 Previous work The electrical noise sources in passive elements and integrated-circuit devices have been investigated extensively. Smallsignal equivalent circuits, including noise, for many integrated-circuit components have been constructed <ref> [1] </ref>. The noise performance of a circuit can be analyzed in terms of these smallsignal equivalent circuits by performing sinusoidal circuit analysis in frequency domain in the usual fashion. This analysis is done separately for each of the uncorrelated noise sources, and for a range of frequencies. <p> specified by the user. 3 Noise models The electrical noise sources in passive elements and integrated-circuit devices have been investigated extensively, and appropriate models have been derived <ref> [1] </ref>[8]. Traditionally, these noise models are presented as stationary noise sources in the smallsignal equivalent (at an operating point) circuits of the devices [1]. In this section, we describe the adaptation of these noise models for use in our timedomain noise simulation method. In our method, the noise sources are inserted in thelarge-signal models of the integrated-circuit devices and they are, in general, nonstationary. <p> The noise source models we use in our method are adapted from <ref> [1] </ref> and [8]. As it will become clear in Section 4, our noise simulation method requires that noise sources are white. The thermal and shot noise sources are modeled as white noise sources, hence they can be directly included in the simulation. <p> The thermal noise in a resistor can be modeled by a white Gaussian noise current source with intensity (3.1) where is Boltzmanns constant, is the absolute temperature and is the resistance <ref> [1] </ref>. The thermal noise source associated with a resistor is a IN thermal R k T R stationary white noise process, assuming that the resistance value is a constant as a function of time. <p> For a stationary white Gaussian noise process, the power spectral density (a function of frequency) is a constant on the entire real axis. 3.1.2 Junction diodes The series resistance , in the model of a junction diode <ref> [1] </ref>, is a physical resistor due to the resistivity of silicon, hence it exhibits thermal noise. The thermal noise in can be modeled as in Section 3.1.1. The junction exhibits shot noise which is associated with the current ow through the diode. <p> A white Gaussian noise model is appropriate for thermal and shot noise in integrated circuits <ref> [1] </ref>. Flicker noise sources are taken care of in the way described in Section 3.2. in (4.3) is simply a combination of independent one-dimensional white Gaussian noise processes as defined above. <p> Such an analysis would predict the noise at the output as stationary, i.e. a constant noise variance as a function of time. The noise performance of a mixer circuit is commonly characterized by its noise figure which can be defined by <ref> [1] </ref> (6.1) This definition is intended for circuits in smallsignal operation. For such circuits, noise figure is a scalar quantity. In our case, the noise at the output of the mixer circuit changes as a function of time over one period.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this method is only applicable to linear time-invariant circuits (e.g. the smallsignal equivalent circuits corresponding to circuits with fixed operating points). It is not appropriate for noise simulation of circuits with changing bias conditions, or circuits which are not meant to operate in smallsignal conditions. [2,3] and <ref> [6] </ref> present noise analysis techniques for nonlinear circuits with a periodic large signal excitation. The noise analysis for a nonlinear circuit with a periodic large signal excitation reduces to the analysis of a linear periodically time-varying circuit with cyclostationary [2,3][6] noise sources. <p> This Taylors approximation is similar to the one we will present in Section 4.1. The noise analysis methods described in [2,3] and <ref> [6] </ref> use frequency-domain methods based on manipulating impulse responses and transfer functions for a linear periodically time-varying system, andspectral densities for cyclostationary noise sources.

Reference-contexts: The previous work on noise simulation in timedomain is restricted to techniques which employ the Monte Carlo method <ref> [7] </ref>. This method has several drawbacks. Pseudorandom number generators often do not generate a lar ge sequence of independent numbers, but reuse old random numbers instead. This becomes a problem if a circuit with many noise sources is simulated.

This is assured with (3.6) 4 Development of the simulation method The noise simulation method will be described assuming that modified nodal analysis (MNA) <ref> [10] </ref> is used for the formulation of circuit equations.

The initial value vector is obtained by a dc solution of the circuit before the transient simulation is started. For a circuit, there may be several different dc solutions. The first-order Taylors expansion of around is expressed as (4.2) which will be used later. <p> At each time point , the numerical methods compute an approximation of the exact solution <ref> [10] </ref>. The noise simulation (solution of (4.28) and (4.30)) is done concur rently with the transient simulation. (4.28) represents a system of linear dif ferential equations. We currently use the Back ward Euler scheme to discretize these equations in time. <p> Then, and are used to calculate in the discretized solution of (4.28) with the Backward Euler scheme. This last operation requires the solution of simultaneous linear equations, because Backward Euler is an implicit method <ref> [10] </ref>. Here, is, roughly , the number of nodes to which a capacitor is connected. Simulations have shown that, for lar ger circuits, the CPU time spent for this last operation at a time point heavily dominates the CPU time required by the other operations.

Reference-contexts: With this direct method linear solver, the computational cost of noise simulation is still high for large-scale circuits. Experiments with several circuits have shown that significant speedup can be obtained by using a parallel iterative linear solver (running on a CM-5) <ref> [17] </ref>, especially for larger circuits.
