Reference-contexts: Of course, as striking as this similarity is, Dudek's work was performed in hippocampus and the BCM theory was developed for visual cortex. And, although these two forms of synaptic plasticity (depression and potentiation) have been reported in the sensory neocortex <ref> (cf. Artola et al., 1990) </ref>, evidence to date has indicated that they occur with far lower probability, usually require pharmacological treatments for their induction, and are elicited by stimulation patterns that differ dramatically from those that are effective in hippocampus (see discussion in Bear et al., 1992).

Reference-contexts: Below, we give another interpretation of this projection index in light of the previous discussion. If we assume that the retina is performing decorrelation of the inputs <ref> (Atick and Redlich, 1992) </ref> then the covariance matrix C (ff; fi) is diagonal (assuming that the inputs have zero mean) and so for eigen values e (ff), equation 5.7 becomes: dm (ff; t) = f fi;fl X e (fl)m 2 (fl)g: (5.8) This suggests that the BCM synaptic modification equation is

Reference-contexts: In support of the hypothesis that NMDA receptor mechanisms play a role in synaptic plasticity, Bear and co-workers have found that the pharmacological blockade of NMDA receptors with the competitive antagonist AP5 disrupts the physiological (Klein-schmidt et al., 1987; Bear et al., 1990) and anatomical <ref> (Bear and Colman, 1990) </ref> consequences of monocular deprivation in striate cortex.

Together, these data have been taken as support for the view that hippocampus and sensory neocortex may be quite distinct with respect to their capability for synaptic change.

Reference-contexts: This principle is optimal when the goal is to accurately reconstruct the input, but is not optimal when the goal is classification. This is shown in the following simple example <ref> (Figure 3, see also p. 212 Duda and Hart, 1973) </ref>. Two clusters each belonging to a different class cluster is different in each direction (B). are presented. The goal is to find a single dimensional projection that will capture the structure information in the data.

Reference-contexts: Although the interpretation of these experiments is compromised by the finding that AP5 reduces visually evoked responses <ref> (Fox et al., 1989) </ref>, the data indicate that activity evoked in visual cortex in the absence of NMDA receptor activation is not sufficient to produce loss of closed-eye responsiveness in MD.

Reference-contexts: This formulation permits us to demonstrate the connection between the unsupervised BCM learning procedure and various statistical methods, in particular, that of Exploratory Projection Pursuit <ref> (Friedman, 1987) </ref>. It also provides a general method for stability analysis of the fixed points of the theory and enables us to analyze the behavior and the evolution of the network under various visual rearing conditions.

Reference-contexts: However, still open is the question of the sliding modification threshold. Although more work remains to be done on this question, we note that two recent studies have shown that the sign and magnitude of a synaptic modification in both hippocampus <ref> (Huang et al., 1992) </ref> and the Mauthner cell of goldfish (Yang and Faber, 1991) have been shown to depend on the recent history of synaptic activation. 8 Data replotted from Dudek and Bear (1992). 4 Reformulation and Extensions of the BCM Theory In order to compare the BCM theory with other

Reference-contexts: To quote Mastronarde: "Some of the strongest evidence on the importance of correlated firing in development comes from cases where local correlations in activity are induced by sensory stimulation; e.g. formation of binocular cells in visual cortex requires binocularly corresponding 15 visual input to the two eyes <ref> (Hubel and Wiesel, 1965) </ref>. There has been growing interest in a more restricted question: what is the role in development of the correlated activity that occurs in the spontaneous discharge?" (Mastronarde, 1989).

Reference-contexts: It is important to note here that this procedure does not eliminate higher order correlation in the data. Finding Other Interesting Low-Dimensional Structure in Data This problem has recently been discussed in the context of a statistical method called projection pursuit (PP) <ref> (Huber, 1985, for review) </ref>. This method seeks structure that is exhibited by (linear) projections of the data, and is therefore relevant to neural network theory since the activity of a neuron is believed to be a function of the projection of the inputs on the vector of synaptic weights.

Reference-contexts: 4 Reformulation and Extensions of the BCM Theory In order to compare the BCM theory with other theories of synaptic plasticity as well as to exhibit its information processing and statistical properties, the following formulation proves convenient. 4.1 Objective function formulation In a recent statistical formulation of the BCM theory <ref> (Intrator and Cooper, 1992) </ref>, the threshold fi m was defined 2 as fi m = E [(x m) 2 ]; and an energy function that corresponds to a risk function in statistical decision theory was presented: R m = f 3 1 E 2 [(x m) 2 ]g: (4.1) It was <p> a risk function in statistical decision theory was presented: R m = f 3 1 E 2 [(x m) 2 ]g: (4.1) It was shown that the differential equations describing synaptic weight modification are a stochastic approximation of the negative gradient of the risk, hence tending to minimize this risk <ref> (Intrator and Cooper, 1992, for review) </ref>. This formulation permits us to demonstrate the connection between the unsupervised BCM learning procedure and various statistical methods, in particular, that of Exploratory Projection Pursuit (Friedman, 1987). <p> Note that the multiplication by 0 reduces sensitivity to outliers of the differential equation since for outliers 0 is close to zero. The gradient decent procedure is valid, provided that the risk is bounded from below <ref> (cf. Intrator and Cooper, 1992) </ref>. 4.3 Networks with Feed-Forward Inhibition: Application to Classification Intrator and Cooper (1992) have extended the single cell theory to a feed forward inhibition network which does not require the mean field approximation; nor does it require that the cortico-cortical synapses L ij be constant. <p> k Therefore the total gradient becomes: _m k = @m k m ) 0 (~c k )x] j6=k m ) 0 (~c j )x]g: (4.8) This biologically motivated system of equations has many desirable statistical properties and has been applied to various non-trivial feature extraction tasks such as phoneme recognition <ref> (Intrator, 1992) </ref> and 3D object recognition (Intrator and Gold, 1993). 5 Comparison of BCM with Other Visual Cortical Plasticity Theories In order to compare ideas concerning visual cortical plasticity, it is important to analyze separately the different components that make up a theory, and to compare theories feature by feature. <p> However, the addition of the third order moment adds important feature such as skewness to the description of the distribution (Kendall and Stuart, 1977, for review), and in this case, it adds information about multimodality <ref> (Intrator, 1992) </ref>. The method of principal components is sufficient for finding clusters in data when the variance of each cluster is relatively constant in all directions, since then directions that maximize the variance also maximize the information conveyed for the purpose of classification.
