Abstract: The paper analyses recent developments of a number of memory-based metaheuristics such as taboo search, scatter search, genetic algorithms and ant colonies. It shows that the implementations of these general solving methods are more and more similar. So, a unified presentation is proposed under the name of Adaptive Memory Programming (AMP). A number of methods recently developed for the quadratic assignment, vehicle routing and graph colouring problems are reviewed and presented under the adaptive memory programming point of view. AMP presents a number of interesting aspects such as a high parallelization potential and the ability of dealing with real and dynamic applications.

Reference-contexts: Such instances are typically arising in real applications and often present a large "flow dominance" criterion [61] or a large "ruggedness" value <ref> [1] </ref>. To obtain the best solutions in the shortest time, the fast ant system of [55] is one of the best method. If solutions of higher quality are desired, it seems that keeping a number of solutions in memory can be recommended.

Reference-contexts: A parallel version of the latter algorithm was implemented on a network of workstations <ref> [2] </ref> and adapted for a real-time version of the problem, where customer requests occur in an on-going fashion [25, 26]. <p> Finally, let us point out a few advantages of adaptive memory programming. First, the technique is very well adapted for a parallel implementation on distributed computers <ref> [2] </ref>. Indeed, the most computationally expensive part of the algorithm is often the local search procedure. Therefore, it is possible to place a local search process on many processors, each of them working on different provisory solutions.

Reference-contexts: In fact, the reactive taboo search proposed by Battiti and Tecchi-olli <ref> [3] </ref> was designed to automatically adapt the taboo list size and avoid the fastidious task of explicitly managing the taboo list. The main difficulty with taboo search is thus to efficiently incorporate diversification and intensification mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: Applications of genetic algorithms for variants of the VRPTW may also be found in <ref> [4, 42, 59, 60, 58] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: There are other metaheuristics that share a number of characteristics with this AMP scheme.

Reference-contexts: From a theoretical point of view, however, the use of these methods has not yet been justified. For example, a few convergence theorems for SA or TS exist <ref> [34, 17] </ref> but they are useless in practice. These theorems simply state that the search has a very high probability of ending with an optimal solution if a disproportionate computing time is allowed (larger, in fact, than the time needed for a complete enumeration of the solution space).

In 1994, however, Taillard [50] developed a true AMP method, where a taboo search heuristic is used to improve provisory solutions constructed from an adaptive memory. The method was then tested on the VRPTW and good results were published in Rochat and Taillard [44].

Reference-contexts: The term taboo search has been proposed for the first time by Glover <ref> [28] </ref> in 1986. The basic idea of this method is to locally and repeatedly modify a solution while memorizing these modifications to avoid visiting the same solutions a second time or in a cyclic manner. <p> In this sense, the metaheuristics with memory presented in this section are implicitly contained in taboo search. We think, however, that the term taboo search does not appropriately characterize their most recent implementations. The most important idea of the first publication on taboo search <ref> [28] </ref> is the use of a short term memory, known as the taboo list. Numerous applications, even recent ones, still only exploits this mechanism. The use of long term memories spread well after the "complete" description of taboo search by Glover [29, 30]. <p> However, a number of implementations, even recent ones, use only the basic ingredients found in Glover's 1986 paper <ref> [28] </ref>. The main advantage of the basic version is its aggressiveness: the search converges toward a local optimum and examines the neighbourhood of this local optimum very quickly. However, it can easily get trapped in a subspace containing only solutions of poor quality.

Reference-contexts: The latter modifications do not necessarily improve the solution at each iteration but the aim is to direct the search toward a good subset of solutions. Later, Glover proposed a number of strategies to guide the search and make it more efficient <ref> [29, 30] </ref>; at the same time, he emphasized that taboo search was open to any strategy well adapted to the problem on which it is applied. In this sense, the metaheuristics with memory presented in this section are implicitly contained in taboo search. <p> Numerous applications, even recent ones, still only exploits this mechanism. The use of long term memories spread well after the "complete" description of taboo search by Glover <ref> [29, 30] </ref>. These are found under different forms, from statistics on modifications made to the current solution [45, 47, 48, 49] to complete solutions of high quality visited during the search. <p> The most recent implementations incorporate local search mechanisms to improve the solutions pro duced by the ants. taboo search * Taboo search also contained all elements of the AMP framework, at least in its complete version in <ref> [29, 30] </ref>.

Later, Glover proposed a number of strategies to guide the search and make it more efficient <ref> [29, 30] </ref>; at the same time, he emphasized that taboo search was open to any strategy well adapted to the problem on which it is applied. In this sense, the metaheuristics with memory presented in this section are implicitly contained in taboo search. <p> Numerous applications, even recent ones, still only exploits this mechanism. The use of long term memories spread well after the "complete" description of taboo search by Glover <ref> [29, 30] </ref>. These are found under different forms, from statistics on modifications made to the current solution [45, 47, 48, 49] to complete solutions of high quality visited during the search. <p> The most recent implementations incorporate local search mechanisms to improve the solutions pro duced by the ants. taboo search * Taboo search also contained all elements of the AMP framework, at least in its complete version in <ref> [29, 30] </ref>. However, a number of implementations, even recent ones, use only the basic ingredients found in Glover's 1986 paper [28]. The main advantage of the basic version is its aggressiveness: the search converges toward a local optimum and examines the neighbourhood of this local optimum very quickly.

Reference-contexts: From a theoretical point of view, however, the use of these methods has not yet been justified. For example, a few convergence theorems for SA or TS exist <ref> [34, 17] </ref> but they are useless in practice. These theorems simply state that the search has a very high probability of ending with an optimal solution if a disproportionate computing time is allowed (larger, in fact, than the time needed for a complete enumeration of the solution space).

Finally, let us point out a few advantages of adaptive memory programming. First, the technique is very well adapted for a parallel implementation on distributed computers [2]. Indeed, the most computationally expensive part of the algorithm is often the local search procedure.

Reference-contexts: Then, the procedure presented above for the VRP can be applied to built a partial colouring that is improved with a taboo search <ref> [36] </ref>. So, the method goes along the lines of the AMP of Rochat and Taillard [44].

The analogy between this evolutionary process and the GA meta-heuristic proposed by Holland <ref> [37] </ref> can be established in the following way. An individual is associated with a feasible solution of the problem at hand. The solution is encoded as a binary vector.

Reference-contexts: (a) may imply that all neighbours of s k are examined and the best non taboo solution is chosen; it may also imply the construction, in a complex way, of a solution that is not so close of s k , through another embedded metaheuristic, as in Rochat and Taillard <ref> [44] </ref>. 2.4 Ant systems The idea of imitating the behaviour of ants to find solutions to combinatorial optimization problems was initiated by Colorni, Dorigo and Maniezzo in 1991 [8, 9, 10]. The metaphor comes from the way ants search for food and find their way back to the nest. <p> In 1994, however, Taillard [50] developed a true AMP method, where a taboo search heuristic is used to improve provisory solutions constructed from an adaptive memory. The method was then tested on the VRPTW and good results were published in Rochat and Taillard <ref> [44] </ref>. Later, Taillard et al. [54] designed another AMP 12 method for a variant of the VRPTW, known as the VRP with soft time windows (VRPSTW), where customer locations can be visited outside of their associated time window (at the expense of a penalty in the objective value). <p> Then, the procedure presented above for the VRP can be applied to built a partial colouring that is improved with a taboo search [36]. So, the method goes along the lines of the AMP of Rochat and Taillard <ref> [44] </ref>. Costa, Hertz and Dubuis [12] and Fleurent and Ferland [20] have proposed particularly effective AMP methods for graph colouring that are designed in the spirit of a genetic algorithm embedding a local search. <p> Later, solutions contained in memory are mostly representative of one or a few 16 good regions of the solution space. The result is that the search gradually shifts from diversification to intensification <ref> [44] </ref>. 4 Conclusion and perspective Our goal was to demonstrate that metaheuristics with memory have evolved toward a unified problem-solving approach that encompasses each one of them.

These implementations, mostly realized before 1995, can hardly be qualified as AMP methods, with the exception of [42] where a genetic algorithm is hybridized with a local search heuristic, in the same spirit as the genetic hybrid of Fleurent and Ferland for the QAP [19].

Reference-contexts: Such instances are typically arising in real applications and often present a large "flow dominance" criterion <ref> [61] </ref> or a large "ruggedness" value [1]. To obtain the best solutions in the shortest time, the fast ant system of [55] is one of the best method. If solutions of higher quality are desired, it seems that keeping a number of solutions in memory can be recommended.

Reference-contexts: For example, taboo search has been applied to the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), where a single type of constraint states that the total load on a tour cannot exceed vehicle capacity <ref> [24, 40, 48, 62] </ref>, the VRP with time windows (VRPTW), where customers must be serviced within specified time intervals (in addition to the capacity constraint) [7, 43], and the VRP with backhauls and time windows (VRPBTW) where customers can be either pick-up or delivery points [16].

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [63] </ref>, the idea is to use a memory and a procedure for producing provisory solutions similar to that presented just above for the VRP.
