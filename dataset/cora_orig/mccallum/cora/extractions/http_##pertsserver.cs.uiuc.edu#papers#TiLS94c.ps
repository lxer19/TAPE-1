Abstract: This paper describes an optimal acceptance test for scheduling sporadic requests together with periodic tasks on an earliest-deadline-first basis. The deadlines of periodic requests must be met. Sporadic requests are accepted only if their deadlines can also be met. The time complexity of our acceptance test is O(n + m), where n is the number of periodic tasks and m is the number of sporadic requests that have previously been accepted but not completed. The proposed algorithm is a significant improvement over previous algorithms which are pseudo-polynomial in time complexity, i.e., O(N + m) where N is the number of periodic requests in a hyperperiod.

Reference-contexts: If the test succeeds, the scheduler accepts the sporadic request and schedule it; otherwsie the scheduler rejects the request. In this paper, we consider the problem of designing an efficient acceptance test for the important special case where off-line requests are instances of periodic tasks <ref> [1] </ref>. In this case, there are an infinite number of off-line requests. The set fR i (r i ; c i ; d i )g of these requests is partitioned into n disjoint subsets. <p> Hereafter, we will use this term. A number of acceptance tests [2, 3, 4, 5] have been proposed for the case where all the requests are independent and are scheduled preemptively on the earliest-deadline-first (EDF) basis. Because of the optimality of the EDF algorithm <ref> [1, 6] </ref>, most of the known acceptance tests (e.g., [2, 3, 4]) based on this principle are optimal in the following sense: A sporadic request is accepted if and only if it can be scheduled without causing any missed deadline, and if it is rejected, all other acceptance tests must also

In an attempt to reduce the time complexity of the acceptance test, McElhone <ref> [5] </ref> proposed five acceptance tests which trade off time complexity with accuracy. Except for the test which takes O (N + m) time, the other tests are pessimistic and not optimal. The fastest test has a time complexity of O ((n + m) 2 ).
