Title: Distributed and Scalable Anisomorphic Geometric Simplification Category: Research/Systems; Format: Spoof  
Keyword: geometric simplification, distributed processing, triangulation, buzzwords, photoreplication, anisomorphic compression  
Abstract: Geometric simplification is a well-known technique for simplifying complex geometric models. Previous work in this area in the past has consisted primarily of lossless compression and error-bounded simplification techniques. By removing such constraints, we can anisomorphically reduce a model's representation|cheaply and efficiently|down to as little as 0% of its original size. We perform such simplification in two stages, which can be employed independently or combined for maximum effect. The first stage, the photoreplication stage, uses only items commonly found in the home or office, and is highly scalable. The second stage (called the first stage for historical reasons) takes advantage of idle distributed resources to further simplify a model. We briefly describe our implementation, and emphasize the ease with which it can be integrated into existing systems.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Geometric simplification is a well-known technique for simplifying complex geometric models. Previous work in this area has consisted of methods which bound the error between the original and simplified model [3], as well as those that implement lossless or error-bounded compression <ref> [1] </ref>. Our research shows that removing such relational constraints between the original and simplified model generates many new possibilities for simplification. We name this class of functions anisomorphic simplification, as they need not preserve the original topology.

Reference-contexts: It is in fact possible to simulate a n-tier photoreplication process with a single duplicator; we state without proof <ref> [2] </ref> that this produces results within human visual tolerance. The method does necessitate a random image rotation at each stage, to reduce the development of duplicator artifacts.

Reference-contexts: The photoreplication stage is necessarily limited by the dimensionality of the print medium, at present 2; the new model must be generated from the points through one of several popular over-the-counter triangulation methods <ref> [4] </ref>. Later in this paper we discuss planned extensions to overcome this dimensionality problem. 3 First Stage The first stage anisomorphically simplifies by use of distributed computing resources, taking advantage of known wide-area network properties such as congestion and packet loss [5].

The model is split into lowest-level primitives, such as points or triangles, and each primitive is wrapped with a unique identifier in a separate unreliable UDP packet. The packets are routed through each of the available workstations in turn, while network congestion eliminates some random subset of primitives.
