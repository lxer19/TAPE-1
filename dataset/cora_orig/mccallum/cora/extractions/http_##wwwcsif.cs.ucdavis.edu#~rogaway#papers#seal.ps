Abstract: We describe a software-efficient encryption algorithm named SEAL 3.0. Computational cost on a 32-bit processor is about 5 elementary machine instructions per byte of text. The cipher is a pseudorandom function family: under control of a key (first pre-processed into an internal table) it stretches a 32-bit position index into a long, pseudorandom string. This string can be used as the keystream of a Vernam cipher.

Reference-contexts: comment that Roe's figures do not represent uniformly-optimized versions for all of these ciphers; in particular, the DES figure may be a factor of five times off of an optimized implementation (at least for the Alpha), and the MD5 implementation may also be under-optimized compared to what is now known <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. 8 Concluding Remarks It should be emphasized that using SEAL does not, by itself, do anything to provide for data authenticity. Many applications which require data privacy also require data authenticity. Such applications should accompany SEAL-encrypted data by a message authentication code (MAC).

Reference-contexts: All of these figures reported in this paragraph are "C" code running on the SGI described above. Key-setup in SEAL has a cost comparable to computing SHA-1 on about 13 KBytes of data; this is estimated to be about 5 msec on a 90 MHz Pentium <ref> [3] </ref>. In the design of SEAL no attention was paid to minimizing key-setup time. If this is at issue in a target application for SEAL one should a different method for generating SEAL's tables (e.g., using RC4 or RC5 [14, 15]), or abandon the use of SEAL entirely. <p> comment that Roe's figures do not represent uniformly-optimized versions for all of these ciphers; in particular, the DES figure may be a factor of five times off of an optimized implementation (at least for the Alpha), and the MD5 implementation may also be under-optimized compared to what is now known <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. 8 Concluding Remarks It should be emphasized that using SEAL does not, by itself, do anything to provide for data authenticity.

Reference-contexts: Our cipher has this characteristic. As such, SEAL is an inappropriate choice for applications which require rapid key-setup. Length-Increasing Pseudorandom Function Variable Output And Key Lengths. The function SEAL is a type of cryptographic object called a pseudorandom function family (PRF). Such objects were first defined in <ref> [4] </ref>. SEAL is a length-increasing PRF: under control of a 160-bit key a, SEAL maps a 32-bit string n to an L-bit string SEAL (a; n; L).

Reference-contexts: While SEAL 3.0 retains that change, the more significant one is responsive to an attack by Handschuh and Gilbert <ref> [5] </ref>. See Section 5 for further information on their attack and the differences between SEAL 3.0 and SEAL 1.0. In this paper the name SEAL, by itself, always refers to SEAL 3.0. 2 Characteristics of the Cipher Key characteristics and design choices of SEAL are explained below. Preprocessing The Key. <p> The design progressed entirely on paper. No statistical tests or other experiments were performed during the design of the cipher. Our proposal, SEAL 1.0, was first described in December 1993 [12]. SEAL 3.0. In 1996 Handschuh and Gilbert <ref> [5] </ref> described an attack on a simplified version of SEAL 1.0, and an attack on SEAL 1.0 itself. They require about 2 30 "samples," each 4-words long, to distinguish SEAL 1.0 from a random function. Their attack is responsible for the main change between SEAL 1.0 and SEAL 3.0. <p> Without the change there is a useful property 8 on (D; C 0 ; D 0 ), say, which does not depend on any of n 1 ; n 2 ; n 3 ; n 4 ; see <ref> [5] </ref>. Un--published predecessors of SEAL 1.0 resembled SEAL 3.0 in modifying each of (A; B; C; D) at the end of an iteration; removing the modifications to B and D was a poorly-chosen optimization. <p> For concreteness, let us now fix our attention on the change that register B undergoes during the second iteration (i = 2) of the algorithm. This change in B is manifest (apart from S [0] and S <ref> [5] </ref>) in y 0 and y 4 . In particular, it is easy to verify by tracing through the definition of WEAK that for some P 1 ; P 5 2 f0; : : : ; 511g. <p> This moves the bit in question into position (D) 18 . On line 7 register D is XORed with a table value which depends on C. But this value of C is manifest in the output stream after it has been shifted and masked by the constant S <ref> [5] </ref>. Thus if the 18-th bit of T [i] is correlated with the most significant bit of i, the change to bit 18 of D which line 7 causes will be correlated to bit 10 (due to the right shift of C in line 7) of y 5 .

Reference-contexts: The other difference between SEAL 3.0 and SEAL 1.0 is that in SEAL 3.0 (and SEAL 2.0) table generation uses SHA-1 in lieu of the older SHA. Statistical Tests. In response to a referee's request we subjected SEAL to a battery of statistical tests developed by Marsaglia <ref> [6] </ref>. We computed the 10 MByte string y = SEAL (a; 0; L)kSEAL (a; 1; L)k kSEAL (a; 156249; L) for a fixed key a and L = 64 8 (i.e., 64 bytes). None of the 15 tests in [8] revealed statistical anomalies in y.

Reference-contexts: An earlier version of this cipher was described in 1993 [12] and denoted SEAL 1.0.

While SEAL 3.0 retains that change, the more significant one is responsive to an attack by Handschuh and Gilbert [5].

None of the 15 tests in <ref> [8] </ref> revealed statistical anomalies in y. In a second experiment we computed the 10.03 MByte string z = SEAL (a; 0; L)kSEAL (a; 1; L)k kSEAL (a; 152; L), where L = 64 1024 8 (i.e., 64 KBytes).

For completeness, its definition is given in Appendix A. Let us re-index G to construct a function whose images are 32-bit words instead of 160-bit ones.

Reference-contexts: SEAL uses 0.5 lookups per byte of output. Merkle's 16-round Khufu uses 2 table lookups per byte, while the S/P permutations of a software DES require 16 or 32 lookups per byte (the former if one uses a 64 KByte internal table; see, e.g., <ref> [11] </ref>). These comparisons ignore the rest of the work which each cipher does, and this work is in fact greater in SEAL than in Khufu or a well-coded DES. Another way to gauge performance is to count instructions relative to some specified machine model.
