Title: Improved Resource-Bounded Borel-Cantelli and Stochasticity Theorems (Research Note)  
Author: Kenneth W. Regan D. Sivakumar 
Abstract: This note strengthens and simplifies Lutz's resource-bounded version of the Borel-Cantelli lemma for density systems and martingales. We observe that the technique can be used to construct martingales that are "additively honest," and also martingales that are "multiplicatively honest." We use this to improve the "Weak Stochasticity Theorem" of Lutz and Mayordomo: their result does not address the issue of how rapidly the bias away from 1/2 converges toward zero in a "stochastic" language, while we show that the bias must vanish exponentially.

One can relax the restriction, expressed in terms of n, to accord with familiar notions of "linearly honest" and "polynomially honest," but the strong length-n-only restriction suffices for our purposes. 1 In a personal communication, 12/94, the second author of <ref> [2] </ref> reports that our results in Section 3 carry over to their measures on P. 4 3. <p> This makes it possible to analyze the resulting martingales for other properties, for instance honesty. Moreover, the simple but tight conditions of convergence we have presented might prove fruitful in strengthening known results (see, for instance, <ref> [2] </ref>) and/or obtaining new results. It will be a worthwhile task to re-work other theorems of Lutz et al. to show the construction of martingales. One example is the theorem that a countable "-union" of -null classes is -null. <p> This approach is especially important with the recent interest in measure on classes smaller than E, and the restrictions on martingales used to define them in <ref> [21, 1, 2] </ref>. Note that our proof of Theorem 2 does nothing clever at all in computing the martingale, and there appears to be useful "slack" for sharper results.

Reference-contexts: The concepts of additive and multiplicative honesty are also interesting in themselves. Which constructions in the measure theory preserve these restrictions? Examples of constructions that build martingales that seem to be inherently dishonest are the "incompressibility theorem" of Juedes and Lutz <ref> [14] </ref>, and other theorems that build martingales that "look back" in the input for specific properties. The notion of multiplicative honesty is important in the connection between martingales and the "natural proofs" of Razborov and Rudich [24, 25], which we have demonstrated in [26].

Complexity classes correspond to point sets in the topological space whose basic open sets are the cylinders C w . The general form of Lutz's theory, expounded recently by Mayordomo <ref> [21] </ref>, defines conditions for a class C to be measurable by a function class , and to have measure e, written (C) = e, where 0 e 1. <p> The restriction to removes the problem that uniform complexity classes are countable, and in classical measure theory, all countable point sets have 2 measure zero. Since all complexity classes we discuss are closed under finite variations, and by a form of the Kolmogorov zero-one law proved in <ref> [21] </ref> have measure zero or one, we need only discuss conditions for classes to have measure zero. <p> Definition 1 (compare <ref> [15, 21] </ref>). Let be a complexity class of functions. <p> This is an intuitive and technically interesting way of saying that C (or C " D) is "small" as a subclass of D. Likewise, C is said to have measure one, in D, if (D n C j D) = 0. 3 Mayordomo <ref> [21] </ref> gives a full demonstration that the martingale definition of "-measure zero" given above is equivalent to the original one, so long as (4) holds and contains P. <p> Our results improve the "Weak Stochasticity Theorem" of Lutz and Mayordomo [17, 19]. The following incorporates several forms of their notion of a "weakly stochastic" language that have appeared in these papers and in <ref> [16, 21] </ref>. <p> This approach is especially important with the recent interest in measure on classes smaller than E, and the restrictions on martingales used to define them in <ref> [21, 1, 2] </ref>. Note that our proof of Theorem 2 does nothing clever at all in computing the martingale, and there appears to be useful "slack" for sharper results. The concepts of additive and multiplicative honesty are also interesting in themselves.

Reference-contexts: Honest martingales To connect our concept to standard notions of "honesty" in complexity theory, we redefine the above formalism so that bounds are expressed in terms of n rather than N . The new formalism is essentially the same as that for "holographic proofs" in <ref> [7, 5, 4, 30, 6] </ref>, with w playing the role of the "proof." Namely, define a query machine M to have a standard TM input tape, any number of standard worktapes, and a query tape that provides "random-access" to bits of a string w given as an auxiliary input.
