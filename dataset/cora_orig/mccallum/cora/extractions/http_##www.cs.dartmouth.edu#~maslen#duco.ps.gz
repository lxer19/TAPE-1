Title: DOUBLE COSET DECOMPOSITIONS AND COMPUTATIONAL HARMONIC ANALYSIS ON GROUPS  
Author: DAVID K. MASLEN AND DANIEL N. ROCKMORE 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce new techniques for the efficient computation of a Fourier transform on a finite group. We use the decomposition of a group into double cosets and a graph theoretic indexing scheme to derive algorithms that generalize the Cooley-Tukey FFT to arbitrary finite groups. We apply our general results to special linear groups and low rank symmetric groups, and obtain new efficient algorithms for harmonic analysis on these classes of groups, as well as the two-sphere.

Reference-contexts: We index the computation at each stage in the Fourier transform algorithm using one less factor in the time domain, but paths of increasing length in the frequency domain, as compared with the previous stage. Remark 2.4. The paper <ref> [1] </ref> gives a different representation theoretic interpretation of the Cooley-Tukey algorithm, relating it to the Weil-Brezin map. 2.2. Algorithms for abelian groups. The Cooley-Tukey algorithm by itself does not give an efficient algorithm for computing Fourier transforms on all abelian groups, or even on all cyclic groups.

We have used the fact that any abelian group G has exactly jGj representations. The group theoretic approach to the Cooley-Tukey algorithm is originally due to Beth <ref> [8] </ref>. We have presented this method because it generalizes to other finite groups, including nonabelian groups. However this approach does have some advantages even when considering the usual discrete Fourier transform.

Reference-contexts: Icosahedral grids. For applications in meteorology, the use of sets of points, invariant under the rotational symmetries of an icosahedron, have been suggested for sampling data on the two-sphere (see e.g. <ref> [31, 32] </ref>). A typical problem in such applications is to compute the spherical harmonic expansion of a function from its values at the invariant set of points. This simplifies the form of rotationally invariant operators such as the Laplacian or gradient.

This is shown in Figure 5. The elements of SL 2 (F 2 ) are exactly 1; n; w; wn; nw; nwn. For SL 2 (F 2 ) our algorithms are not very efficient, but they do illustrate the general case. <p> In Figure 6 we show the precomputed factors for the matrix representations of SL 2 (F 2 ) defined in Appendix A. These are exactly the matrices of representations in Young's seminormal form for S 3 (cf. <ref> [33] </ref>). We also indicate those edges and vertices which are omitted in the first variation of our algorithm on account of zero input values. These parts of the diagram are shown as dotted lines and hollow vertices.

Reference-contexts: We do not intend to provide a self-contained introduction to the representation theory of finite groups, even though we do use a number of elementary facts from representation theory (see e.g., <ref> [50] </ref>). It is, however, useful to recall the following facts and definitions. 1. A (complex) matrix representation of a finite group G is a matrix valued function on G that satisfies the group homomorphism property (gh) = (g)(h) 2. <p> In general, if is a matrix representation of the finite group G, and K is a subgroup of G, then jK is equivalent to a matrix direct sum of irreducible representations of K (see e.g. <ref> [50] </ref> Chapter 1). If is an irreducible representation of K, then the number of representations equivalent to occurring in a matrix direct sum of irreducible representations equivalent to jK is called the multiplicity of injK. These multiplicities are conveniently represented by a Bratteli diagram. Definition 4.3 (Bratteli diagram). <p> Proof. The proof is by character theory. First, compute the generating function for the characters of the symmetric l th powers of + 3 , using the method given in <ref> [50] </ref> 23 Chapter 9.1. Then note that the restriction of T l to G is the quotient of Sym l + 3 by a subrepresentation equivalent to Sym l2 + 3 . <p> 2 T and n 2 N , we have fi fl = 2 ; 3 2X 2 = ffi 1 ; 4 t = ffi 1 ; 4 4 (t 1 nt) = -X; (t 1 nt) 1 ; 4 We complete the proof using elementary character theory (see e.g. <ref> [50] </ref> Chapter 2). The character of -X; is Tr -X; (t n) = (t) 2X (n) if t 2 = 1; 0 otherwise The orthogonality of the characters (n) then implies that the inner product of the character of -X; with itself is 1, so -X; is irreducible. <p> By the proof of Theorem 4.8, this is ;-1 -1 = - B (F q )-) d 2 X d 3 where ranges over irreducible representations of B, and we have used Frobenius reciprocity to simplify the result; see <ref> [50] </ref> Chapter 7.2. The sum on the right hand side is easily found to be 1 2 (q 1)(q 2 2q + 3), so the number of operations for Stage 3 of the algorithm is (q 2 1)(q 2 2q + 3). <p> When the Bratteli diagram has no multiple edges, the subspaces corresponding to the decomposition of jK n1 into irreducibles are uniquely determined (cf. <ref> [50] </ref> Chapter 2.6). Any set of Gel'fand-Tsetlin basis vectors for will lie in the union of these subspaces, and define a set of bases for these subspaces which are part of a system of Gel'fand-Tsetlin bases for K n1 .

Reference-contexts: This defines a coordinate system on a dense open subset of the rotation group, and the coordinates, ' 2 ; ; ' 1 , of any rotation are called its Euler angles (see e.g. <ref> [52] </ref>, p. 106).

This is the subgroup of SO (3) consisting of the rotations about the z-axis. <p> This is the subgroup of SO (3) consisting of the rotations about the z-axis. Then by Equation (4.11), the set of group elements fr 3 ()j 2 [0; ]g is a compete set of double coset representatives for SO (2)nSO (3)=SO (2). It is well known <ref> [52] </ref> that the irreducible representations T l of SO (3) are indexed by nonnegative integers l, and the restriction of T l to SO (2) is equivalent to the sum of the representations r 2 (') 7! e im' of SO (2) with jmj l. <p> carefully, the functions P l m 1 ;m 2 can be written in terms of Jacobi polynomials as (4.13) P l (l m 2 )!(l + m 2 )! 2 fi (sin 2 ) m 1 +m 2 P lm 1 (cos ) For a proof of this formula see <ref> [52] </ref>. With this notation we may define the Fourier transform of a continuous function on SO (3) as follows. Definition 4.12 (Fourier transform on SO (3)). Assume f is a continuous complex valued function on SO (3).

Reference-contexts: The result now follows by the argument given for the first part of the lemma. The arguments used in the above proofs are essentially due to Gel'fand and Tsetlin [29], though the most general formulation is due to Zelobenko <ref> [56] </ref>. We have the existence of systems of Gel'fand-Tsetlin bases, but this still falls short of a practical algorithm for finding such bases. The difficult part is the construction of the change of basis matrix E, and the construction of a complete set of irreducible representations in the first place.
