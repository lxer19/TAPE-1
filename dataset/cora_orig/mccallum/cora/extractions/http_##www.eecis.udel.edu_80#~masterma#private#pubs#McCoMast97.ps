Title: A Tutor for Teaching English as a Second Language for Deaf Users of American Sign Language  
Author: Kathleen F. McCoy Lisa N. Masterman 
Address: 19716  
Affiliation: CIS Department University of Delaware Newark, DE  
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a computer-assisted writing tool for deaf users of American Sign Language (ASL). The novel aspect of this system (under development) is that it views the task faced by these writers as one of second language acquisition. We indicate how this affects the system design and the system's correction and explanation strategies, and present our methodology for modeling the second language ac quisition process.

Reference-contexts: Once the text is loaded, the user may ask that it be analyzed by the system. The text is analyzed (one sentence at a time) by a bottom-up parser found in <ref> (Allen, 1995) </ref> using a grammar which has been augmented with mal-rules to capture errors uncovered in our analysis of writing samples. 2 The mal-rules are indexed with the errors that they realize.

Reference-contexts: In addition to radical differences in the structure of ASL and English, another obstacle to the ASL user acquiring English is the unique processing strategies he brings to the task <ref> (Anderson, 1993) </ref>. The cognitive elements used to store signs in short-term memory are distinctively different from those used with a spoken/written language.

Reference-contexts: There is considerable linguistic evidence that the acquisition order of English features for second-language learners is relatively consistent and fixed regardless of the first language (Ingram, 1989), (Du-lay and Burt, 1974), <ref> (Bailey, Madden, and Krashen, 1974) </ref>. In addition to studies concentrating on second language acquisition, research in language assessment and educational grade expectations (e.g., (Berent, 1988), (Lee, 1974), (Crystal, 1982)) also suggests that language features are acquired in a relatively fixed order. <p> Within any single hierarchy, the features are ordered according to their "difficulty" of acquisition, reflecting their relative linguistic complexity. The ordering within feature hierarchies has been the subject of investigation in work such as (In-gram, 1989), (Dulay and Burt, 1974), and <ref> (Bailey, Madden, and Krashen, 1974) </ref>. SLALOM. We have depicted parts of four hierarchies in the figure: morphological syntactic features, noun phrases, verb complements, and various relative clauses. Within each hierarchy, the intention is to capture an ordering on the feature acquisition.
