Reference-contexts: This growth is recognized internationally with conferences, journals, national plans, and international cooperation. Several national policy documents (Alvey Committee, 1982; Australian Science and T echnology Council, 1990), reports on national projects (Hayashi, 1989; Nonogaki and Ueda, 1991; Curtis and Halbert, 1991), and reviews of regional cooperation <ref> (Bullinger, 1989) </ref> make clear that major efforts are underway to build infrastructure, support research, and develop advanced products. These diverse and multiple efforts provide some examples of how universities, government agencies, businesses, professional societies, and workers in related disciplines can all participate in HCI research. <p> the 1983 document on 'Research Needs for Human Factors.' The NAS/NRC is not a government agency, but advises government agencies under the authority of its Congressional charter as a 'private, nonprofit, self-governing membership corporation.' In Europe, the ESPRIT project devotes approximately 150 person-years of effort per year to HCI research <ref> (Bullinger, 1989) </ref>. In 1988 in Japan, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry created the FRIEND21 project conducted by Institute for Personalized Information Environment (Nonogaki and Ueda, 1991).

More than three quarters of the 2300 attendees of the SIGCHI conference represented commercial developers of hardware, software, and systems.
