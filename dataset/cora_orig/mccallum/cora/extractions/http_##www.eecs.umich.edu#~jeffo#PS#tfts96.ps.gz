Abstract: The most straightforward discrete implementation of bilinear time-frequency distributions (TFDs) are aliased in frequency, so as a result many different discrete TFDs have been developed. The traditional viewpoint in constructing discrete TFDs is that they should be samples of continuous TFDs. This paper introduces a second viewpoint: that discrete TFDs are inherently different, and thus, while having the same general goal, will not emulate continuous TFDs exactly. This paper develops properties corresponding to the second viewpoint for three types of discrete TFDs. A class of TFDs that satisfies the appropriate properties is also presented for each of the three types of discrete distributions. One of these is the class of alias-free generalized discrete time time-frequency distributions (AF-GDTFDs). It can be shown that the three classes of discrete TFDs presented here include every time and frequency shift covariant, bilinear TFD, so can be considered to be Cohen's classes for discrete signals.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION The Wigner distribution and other members of Cohen's class of distributions have proven to be very useful in many signal processing applications <ref> [1] </ref>. To actually implement these distributions on a computer one needs to discretize the time and frequency variables. The most direct approach results in aliasing in the frequency direction by a factor of two.

As a result, many different discrete TFDs have been developed in an attempt to overcome this problem (see <ref> [2] </ref> and references therein).

If we focus on a frequency range of [; ], then a cross term should appear at a frequency of 0 radians. If we focus on a frequency range of <ref> [0; 2] </ref>, then a cross term should appear at a frequency of radians. There is no reason to prefer one range over another, so a natural solution would be to include cross terms at both 0 and radians.

Second, the class of AF-GDTFDs includes the discrete time spectrogram. Third, the class of AF-GDTFDs uses the Nyquist sampled signal without interpolation. Finally, the class of AF-GDTFDs satisfies the above circular cross term rules for type II TFDs.

Reference-contexts: The first viewpoint asserts that a discrete TFD should be samples Supported in part by ONR Contract number N00014-90-J-1654 and NSF Grant BCS 9110571. of a continuous TFD. This approach has been very clearly defined by Nuttall <ref> [5] </ref>. The second viewpoint asserts that discrete TFDs are inherently different, and thus, while having the same general goal as continuous time TFDs, will not emulate them exactly. Four types of signals used in Fourier analysis are: continuous and aperiodic, discrete and aperiodic, continuous and periodic, and discrete and periodic.

Reference-contexts: For the Wigner distribution <ref> [6] </ref> and smoothed Wigner distributions the cross terms satisfy the following two properties: * cross terms are centered exactly between two auto terms, and * the frequency of oscillation in the time direction of the cross term is the frequency separation of the two auto terms.

Reference-contexts: Third, the class of AF-GDTFDs uses the Nyquist sampled signal without interpolation. Finally, the class of AF-GDTFDs satisfies the above circular cross term rules for type II TFDs. This will be seen in an example, and has been shown for a more general case <ref> [7] </ref>. Two AF-GDTFDs are calculated and shown in Figure 3. The first is the Quasi-Wigner distribution of two parallel chirps and the second is the Binomial distribution of the same two chirps. The Quasi-Wigner distribution shows all the cross terms characteristic of a type II TFD.

Reference-contexts: This class of TFDs satisfies the necessary properties for a class of type IV TFDs. Richman et. al. <ref> [8] </ref> have defined a Shenoy Wigner distribution based on type IV signals. It has been shown that this a member of C IV x . 7. CONCLUSIONS The traditional objective in defining a discrete TFD is that it should be samples of a continuous TFD.

Reference-contexts: Finally, all four classes of TFDs are covariant to time and frequency shifts. The class for type I signals is Cohen's class and has been shown to include all time and frequency shift covariant, bilinear TFDs. By extending the proof for the type I Cohen's class <ref> [9] </ref> it can be seen that the three discrete classes also include every time and frequency shift covariant, bilinear TFD.
