Title: AN EXPERIMENTAL OVERVIEW OF MESON SPECTROSCOPY DATA  
Author: Curtis A. Meyer 
Address: Pittsburgh, PA 15213  
Affiliation: Carnegie Mellon University,  
Abstract: In this article, I will provide an introduction to the field of experimental meson spectroscopy. I will start with a brief overview of how we classify mesons, and determine which mesons are which. I will then give a summary of how we extract mesons properties from data, and finally overview what the current issues are in the field.

Reference-contexts: For a qq system, P = (1) (L) , C = (1) (L+S) and G = (1) (L+S+I) . A nice description is given in reference <ref> [1] </ref>. This leads to the expected spectrum of nonets shown schematically in labeled in gray either need confirmation, or the assignment is not certain. The empty boxes indicate states which are not known. The mass listed below each box are taken from reference [2].

Reference-contexts: This leads to the expected spectrum of nonets shown schematically in labeled in gray either need confirmation, or the assignment is not certain. The empty boxes indicate states which are not known. The mass listed below each box are taken from reference <ref> [2] </ref>. They are the estimated mass of the states containing mostly u and d quarks. In order to uniquely identify that a state belongs to a particular nonet, it is necessary to look at several properties of the state.

Reference-contexts: A nice description of this procedure is given in reference <ref> [3] </ref>, where the authors also include a possible glueball admixture in addition to the nonet mixing angle. This procedure works extremely well for the tensor mesons. IDENTIFICATION OF MESONS Mesons have been studied in several different production mechanisms which are cartooned in Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: The system starts in a well defined state, ( (I G )J P C are known). If we then consider a process such as pp ! abc, we assume that this can be described in terms of the isobar model <ref> [4] </ref>, which leads to the chain shown in eqn. 2.

Reference-contexts: -| - J A J c L a ( a |-z b |-z ) c (2) The angular distributions, Z (J 0 ; J A ; J a ; J b ; ; L A ; L a ), can be described in terms of the helicity formalism, (see reference <ref> [5] </ref> for a description with good examples). The angular distribution is a function of all the spins and angular momenta in the problem, but in fact may not be unique. I.e. two or more sets of spins and angular momenta may yield the same distributions.

Reference-contexts: One way to handle this is in the K-matrix formalism, which is particularly powerful when more than one final state of a resonance have been measured in the same experiment. A good article on this can be found in reference <ref> [6] </ref>. In the case of a three-body final state, the analysis is normally carried out in the framework of a Dalitz plot. Figure 3 shows the Dalitz plot for the process pn ! ffi at rest, (these data are taken from reference [7]).

Figure 3 shows the Dalitz plot for the process pn ! ffi at rest, (these data are taken from reference <ref> [7] </ref>). The prominent diagonal band is the (770) recoiling against a spectator . There is also a horizontal band corresponding to the a ffi 2 (1320) against a spectator and a vertical band corresponding to the a 2 (1320) recoiling against a spectator ffi . <p> While many of these have the same quantum numbers as ordinary mesons, and are likely to be mixed, there are several that have exotic, or non-q q quantum numbers. In fact there is recent evidence of such states <ref> [7] </ref>, [9], [12]. Even in the few situations where we have identified a number of states, the identification of a particular state is often hindered by its observation in only one production mechanism, and only a very small number of decay modes.

Reference-contexts: In the case of either the diffractive production or the t-channel exchange, the partial wave analysis is done in a somewhat different way. The underlying assumption here is that the amplitudes can be broken in to two or more incoherent sets. These essentially correspond to spin-flip and spin-non-flip amplitudes <ref> [8] </ref>. In and data without the ^, (b) and with the ^, (c). these procedures, only the X system of Figure 2 is treated.

Reference-contexts: From these fits, one extracts the intensity and phase of each partial wave as a function of mass. Figure 4 shows the results from one of these fits taken from reference <ref> [9] </ref>. in the 1 ++ and 2 + partial waves. These results are then fit two the assumption of resonances in the partial waves. Here explaining the relative phase differences is key to extracting the resonance parameters. <p> While many of these have the same quantum numbers as ordinary mesons, and are likely to be mixed, there are several that have exotic, or non-q q quantum numbers.

Reference-contexts: ISSUES IN SPECTROSCOPY Given the issues in identifying and cataloging mesons, we now come to the question of what are the interesting topics in meson spectroscopy? Figure 1 of reference <ref> [10] </ref> shows a modified view of Figure 1. It shows not only the normal mesons, but also expectations for glueballs, hybrid mesons, and where several meson-meson molecular thresholds lie. See reference [11] for a more detailed description of these states and their properties. <p> Reference [20] discusses the ss spectrum, which takes advantage of the fact that there is a significant ss content in the photon. Reference [19] discusses why photo production is expected to be a good place to find hybrid mesons, and which ones would be most easily seen. Finally, reference <ref> [10] </ref> discusses the Hall D project to build a state of the art detector whose main goal would be to study meson spectroscopy.

See reference <ref> [11] </ref> for a more detailed description of these states and their properties. I will only mention that all models of non-perturbative QCD as well as lattice calculations predict that these states exist.

Reference-contexts: As an example, we will consider the 2 ++ and J states. Of all the higher mass mesons, there are more known 2 ++ states than anything else. In Figure 5 are listed the known 2 ++ mesons from reference <ref> [13] </ref>. The bars indicate the expected location of the first radial states, the 3 F 2 states and the glueball. Also indicated are some of the 3 F 4 states which are expected to have similar masses to the 3 F 2 states.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately the K K mode is probably too small. The f 2 (1950) is also a candidate for this state, but there is also speculation that this broad state has a large glueball content <ref> [14] </ref>. The f J (2220) or ~ is also a glueball candidate because of its very narrow width, and large rate in radiative J= decays [15]. Finally, there are several higher mass states that have only been observed in one or two decay modes.

Reference-contexts: Many of the expected decay patterns have been computed in the 3 P 0 model <ref> [16] </ref>. <p> These decays do not appear important for the (1700) and the !(1600). It is these latter states which people speculate are strongly mixed with the hybrid nonet. Unfortunately, only detailed studies of the decay patters will allow us to unravel this. Reference <ref> [16] </ref> calculates the various rates for both the 3 D 1 and hybrid . Detailed comparison with currently emerging results may yield new insights on this problem.

Reference-contexts: Given the proximity of the 3 D 1 and both 2 3 S 1 and 3 3 S 1 states, strong mixing cannot be excluded. Also, recent observations of the (1450) and !(1420) indicate that they have large rates to the ground state vector plus () S <ref> [17] </ref>, [18]. This leads one to speculate that a similar decay should be present for the (1680). These decays do not appear important for the (1700) and the !(1600). It is these latter states which people speculate are strongly mixed with the hybrid nonet.

Reference-contexts: More significantly, finding the expected gluonic states, (hybrids and glueballs) and understanding their mixings with the normal q q states would expand our understanding of just how glue behaves.
