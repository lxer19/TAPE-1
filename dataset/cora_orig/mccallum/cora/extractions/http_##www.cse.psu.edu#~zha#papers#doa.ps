Title: FAST ALGORITHMS FOR DIRECTION-OF-ARRIVAL FINDING USING LARGE ESPRIT ARRAYS  
Author: HONGYUAN ZHA 
Abstract: Exploring the redundancy in large ESPRIT arrays, we propose fast algorithms for Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) finding without computing (partial) eigendecompositions. For batch processing, the algorithms have computational complexity O(M 2 d) for the covariance matrix case and O(M Nd) for the data matrix case, where M is the number of sensors, d the number of signals and N the number of snapshots. For a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithms, the computational complexity is O(Md) + O(d 3 ) per data vector update. We also present numerical simulation results to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.
