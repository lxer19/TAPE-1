Abstract: The paper uses a simple and abstract characterization of dialogue in terms of mental state changes of dialogue participants to raise three fundamental questions for any theory of dialogue. It goes on to discuss currently popular accounts of dialogue with respect to these three questions. Next, the notion of `conversational game' is revisited within a probabilistic and decision theoretic framework, and it is argued that such an interpretation is plausible both intuitively and as the basis for computational implementation. An illustrated sketch of A simple, rather abstract description of a canonical dialogue is that it consists of a sequence of utterances with a corresponding sequence of mental states of the participants in the dialogue. Person A has a sequence of mental states S A1 . . . S An+1 and person B also has a sequence S B1 . . . S Bn+1 . Connecting these two sequences is a third sequence, the sequence of utterances. U A1 is produced by A in state A1, U B2 is produced by B in B2 and so on. Furthermore, A's state S A2 and B's state S B2 are, at least partially, determined by the utterance U A1 which precedes them. The utterances change the mental states of the participants to the point where no further communication is regarded by them as necessary: the goals of the conversation, whatever they were, have been achieved as far as is possible. This is represented by the diagram in figure 1. a proposed implementation using Bayesian networks is described.

Reference-contexts: Bayesian Networks have been used in natural language processing for story understanding (see, for example, [CG91]) and word-sense disambiguation.

The system they describe uses two networks: one `Conversational Space' network is responsible for hypothesising the interpretation of an utterance and the associated speaker intention.

Reference-contexts: Games interpreted in a decision-theoretic way have also been used within philosophy of language, notably by Hintikka, although within computational linguistics this line of enquiry is probably best known, in one version at least, through the work of <ref> [Car83] </ref>. However, the most direct inspiration for the approach described here is a paper by [GRP91], in which they describe a hybrid rule-based/neural network approach to the pragmatics micro-world of bidding in bridge, in which bids are seen as various kinds of simple speech act.

Reference-contexts: There is a straightforward interpretation of these networks as networks of beliefs, and indeed that is how they were originally envisaged in <ref> [Pea88] </ref>. When Bayesian networks are augmented with the apparatus of decision and value nodes, and utilities, then it is plausible to think of them as modelling some aspects of desire and and possibly intention, although the correspondence is not exact.
