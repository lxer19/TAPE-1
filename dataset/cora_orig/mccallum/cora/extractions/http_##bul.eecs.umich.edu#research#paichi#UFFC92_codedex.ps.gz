Abstract: To increase range resolution and produce acceptable range sidelobe levels, filtering techniques rather than direct complex correlation are applied in coded excitation systems. In this paper, a new filter design technique based on both peak sidelobe levels and minimum sidelobe energy criteria is developed. In comparison to a classic inverse filter, this approach reduces sidelobe levels under a prespecified threshold. Further reduction can be achieved by extending the filter length. Indeed, this technique can be more generally applied to similar signal processing problems. Both the mathematical formulation and simulation results demonstrating the utility of the technique are presented. Finally, a discussion of quantization effects is included.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction It has been shown that signal to noise ratio (SNR) improvements of about 15 dB can be achieved in a practical phased array imaging system using simple "pseudo-chirp" excitation <ref> [1] </ref>. Coded excitation, in general, improves SNR by increasing average acoustic power without affecting instantaneous peak power [2] - [9]. Due to time-bandwidth product limitations, however, autocorrelation based codes, e.g., m-sequence codes and Golay codes, produce unacceptable range sidelobe levels for medical imaging applications. <p> Due to time-bandwidth product limitations, however, autocorrelation based codes, e.g., m-sequence codes and Golay codes, produce unacceptable range sidelobe levels for medical imaging applications. In contrast to autocorrelation processing, acceptable sidelobe levels can be obtained by applying direct filtering techniques. In reference <ref> [1] </ref>, measurements with an actual phased array system have shown that high quality images can be obtained with a simple coded excitation technique.

Using a single correlator acting on the coherently summed output of a phased array transducer, an inverse filtering approach was developed in reference [1] to produce acceptable range sidelobe levels while maintaining fine axial resolution and significantly improved SNR. In this paper, these basic methods are extended and generalized by applying optimization techniques to the design of the correlator reference waveform. A pseudo-chirp sequence is a binary approximation to a chirp signal. <p> In a typical phased array system, the master clock is a factor of 4 8 times higher than the ultrasound carrier frequency (i.e., f master equals 4 8 times f 0 ). The basic block diagram of the coded excitation system considered here and presented in reference <ref> [1] </ref> is illustrated in Figure 1. Both transmitter and receiver are synchronized using a single master clock. The excitation code is the same for each channel in the array. <p> Both transmitter and receiver are synchronized using a single master clock. The excitation code is the same for each channel in the array. Furthermore, to steer and focus the transmitted beam, the excitation sequence is accurately delayed on each channel by a two-stage process described in <ref> [1] </ref>. In the receiver, the radio frequency (RF) echo signal on each channel is separately digitized using the master clock of the system. <p> In general, most stable solutions converge at the first iteration. 9 3 Simulation Results To test the design described in the previous section, we performed a set of simulations similar to both simulations and measurements described in reference <ref> [1] </ref>. For all studies, the sampling frequency is chosen to be 40 MHz, where a 512-point pseudo-chirp signal centered at 5 MHz with 40% fractional bandwidth, i.e., 4f =2 MHz is used as the excitation waveform. <p> The resultant baseband signal is decimated to a clock rate of 5 MHz resulting in a signal 70 points in duration with discrete spectrum shown in previous section. For comparison, we performed inverse filtering on the same signal using the procedure discussed in <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Since filter coefficients are derived in the Fourier domain, a 10 circular convolution rather than linear convolution is performed. As a result, sidelobe levels are unacceptable for medical imaging. Sidelobe levels can be markedly reduced, however, simply by extending the duration of the filter. In reference <ref> [1] </ref> a simple equalization method is performed for reducing range sidelobes through filter elongation. In the three examples that follow, the new design method described in the previous section is contrasted with the simple equalization approach. The first example uses a 100-point filter. <p> In previous work from our laboratory, a practical system for coded excitation using array transducers with a single complex correlator/filter acting on the output of the array beam former was presented <ref> [1] </ref>. The basic design methods have been extended in this paper to include new optimization techniques allowing direct specification of range sidelobe levels and range mainlobe beamwidth. <p> First, both mainlobe width and range sidelobe levels are tunable. In contrast to traditional matched filter methods, or the inverse filter techniques with equalization presented in reference <ref> [1] </ref>, direct time domain design can simultaneously control these two crucial parameters. Also, a smooth tradeoff between these two parameters can be obtained simply by extending the filter length. Second, overall contrast resolution of the imaging system is optimized while simultaneously maintaining all sidelobes below a certain specified level.

Reference-contexts: In other words, it should be an optimal compromise between range sidelobe level and range sidelobe energy. Recently, a new optimal window design algorithm has been proposed <ref> [12] </ref>. This frequency domain window defines optimality by an adjustable tradeoff between least-squares solutions, e.g., prolate-spheroidal windows, and minimax solutions, e.g., Chebyshev windows. Briefly, this tradeoff is achieved by introducing a quadratic programming problem with quadratic constraints. <p> One of the main differences, however, between these two problems is that the mainlobe beamwidth and sidelobe level are defined in the time domain for the coded excitation system, while in the window design problem discussed in reference <ref> [12] </ref>, they are defined in the frequency 4 domain. In the following section, we will present a formal statement of the problem. <p> Therefore, choosing the optimal phase for c is an important issue, as discussed below. So far, the problem can be stated as follows: Given baseband signal b, choose f to minimize " def = f H Qf subject to Cf = c. As demonstrated in <ref> [12] </ref>, a simple Lagrangian function fl representing a linear combina tion of energy and constraint equations, i.e., fl (f; ) = f H Qf H (Cf c); (9) can be used to determine optimal filter coefficients.

Reference-contexts: It can be easily shown that the optimal solution to equation ( 9) given that Q is non-singular is f = Q 1 C H [CQ 1 C H ] 1 c: (10) This is the weighted minimum norm solution, which also can be obtained using projection theory <ref> [13] </ref>. As noted above, choice of the phases in c is arbitrary.

Reference-contexts: as CR = c H [CQ 1 C H ] 1 c Finally, defining c 0 def 8 and def the CR can be simply expressed as: CR = c 0H Dc 0 : (15) Determining the phases in equation ( 15) is equivalent to the eigenvalue problem described in <ref> [14] </ref>. This technique starts by expressing CR as a function of c 0 . Setting ffiCR = 0 with respect to c 0 , it can be shown that the maximun CR is obtained when c 0 is the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of D.

Furthermore, the filter output can be viewed as a weighted sum of quantized filter coefficients.
