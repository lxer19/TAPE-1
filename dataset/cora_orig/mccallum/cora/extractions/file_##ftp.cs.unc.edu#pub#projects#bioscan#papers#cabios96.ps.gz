Reference-contexts: BioSCAN: A Network Sharable Computational Resource 6 evolution by Dayhoff (Dayhoff et al., 1972), and the BLOSUM (block substitution matrix) tables (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992). A discussion of the rationale behind these tables can be found in Altschul <ref> (Altschul, 1991) </ref>. The default score table for protein searches is set to be blosum62. The Use complexity filtering selects pre-filtering of the query sequence and is currently available only for protein sequence searches. This option eliminates low-complexity segments of the query sequence by masking them out.

Reference-contexts: Solutions to this problem have generally taken two forms: use of non-exhaustive (heuristic) search algorithms, and use of highly parallel processing engines. Two generations of heuristic-based search tools now exist and are exemplified by the popular FASTA (Pearson and Lipman, 1988) and BLAST <ref> (Altschul et al., 1990) </ref> families. The parallel processing path has resulted in programs developed to work well on existing, general-purpose parallel computer systems. Examples of such tools are dFLASH (Rigoutsos and Califano, 1993) for the IBM SP/1 and Blaze (Brutlag et al., 1993) for the MP-1 from MasPar. <p> One of the earliest exhaustive sequence comparison methods is by Needleman and Wunsch (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970). Subsequently, many algorithmic refinements have been offered, most notably by Smith and Waterman (Smith and Waterman, 1981) and Altschul et al <ref> (Altschul et al., 1990) </ref>. In these algorithms, a DNA or RNA molecule is represented as a long string of characters drawn from a four-character alphabet. Similarly, protein molecules are represented as strings of characters from a twenty-character alphabet. <p> Algorithm Biosequence analysis involves the use of mathematical algorithms to detect significant relationships between biosequences, their segments, or patterns derived from them. The BioSCAN system directly implements the linear similarity algorithm. This generates non-gapped alignments, very similar to BLAST <ref> (Altschul et al., 1990) </ref>. The linear similarity score is mathematically expressed as: S L L1 X T (A xk ; B yk ) (1) x;y is the score of the segment pair of length L with rightmost elements A x and B y in alignment.

Reference-contexts: Protein sequence query Protein sequence searches are performed in much the same way as nucleotide sequence searches. There are query forms for submitting named sequence queries and user specified sequence queries. The biomolecular sequence databases currently available are Protein Identification Resource (Barker et al., 1992), SWISS-PROT <ref> (Bairoch and Boeckmann, 1994) </ref>, and GenPept. Two sets of score tables are provided: the PAM tables based on point accepted mutation (PAM) model of Singh, et al.

Reference-contexts: To form a query you must select a database, a score table, specify the probability threshold for a match by chance, and specify the sequence name. The database is selected from the list provided in the Database name field. Currently you may select either the entire GenBank <ref> (Benson et al., 1994) </ref>, any one of its 14 divisions, or the GenBank cumulative update. Selection is made by highlighting the desired entry with the mouse. After selecting the desired database its name will be displayed next to the Database name label.

Reference-contexts: Each VLSIC contains 812 processors and can accommodate a sequence of up to 812 characters <ref> (Dettloff et al., 1991) </ref>. Each VLSIC offers the computational density necessary to handle most protein sequences which have an average length of 400 characters. To handle longer sequences, 16 VLSICs are connected together on a circuit board to form a linear chain of 12,992 processors.

Reference-contexts: These results are reported in a format similar to that generated by the BLAST family of programs.

The smaller the value of P (n) the more significant is the alignment. Note that the value of P (n) is dependent on the search space and a comparison of best sum statistic scores generated by searching different Singh, et al.
