Title: A Six-Point Condition for Ordinal Matrices  keywords: additive, algorithm, evolution, ordinal, phylogeny  
Author: Paul E. Kearney

Abstract: Ordinal assertions in an evolutionary context are of the form "species s is more similar to species x than to species y" and can be deduced from a distance matrix M of interspecies dissimilarities (M [s; x] &lt; M [s; y]). Given species x and y, the ordinal binary character c xy of M is defined by c xy (s) = 1 if and only if M [s; x] &lt; M[s; y], for all species s. In this paper we present several results concerning the inference of evolutionary trees or phylogenies from ordinal assertions. In particular, we present A six-point condition that characterizes those distance matrices whose ordinal binary characters are pairwise compatible. This characterization is analogous to the four-point condition for additive matrices. An optimal O(n 2 ) algorithm, where n is the number of species, for recovering a phylogeny that realizes the ordinal binary characters of a distance matrix that satisfies the six-point condition. An NP-completeness result on determining if there is a phylogeny that realizes k or more of the ordinal binary characters of a given distance matrix.

Reference-contexts: Each internal edge 3 e of a phylogeny T labelled by S partitions S into two sets; those species in one connected component of T feg and those in the other. A phylogeny T is characterized by the list of partitions induced by its internal edges <ref> [Barthelemy et al. 1991] </ref>. Since T 1 is minimal, for each internal edge e 1 of T 1 there is a midpath m (x; y) such that m (x; y) = e 1 .

Consequently, M converges to T as well, and so, methods that infer phylogeny from ordinal assertions supported by that phylogeny are consistent.

Hence, there is much interest in examining the relationship between a phylogeny T and M .

Reference-contexts: Kannan and Warnow also proved that deciding if there is a weighted or unweighted phylogeny that supports an arbitrary set of ordinal assertions is NP-complete. This work was extended by Kearney et. al. <ref> [Kearney et al. 1996] </ref> where it was shown that T is unique to T when T is an unweighted phylogeny. Furthermore, T can be recovered from T in O (n 2 log (n)) time.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, because of redundancy (c ab = c xy ), the support for each edge of T can be quantified. This contrasts with methods such as neighbor-joining <ref> [Saitou et al. 1987] </ref> that output a binary phylogeny where there is no indication of the support for each edge. Hence, an interesting direction for future work is the development of heuristic algorithms for inferring unweighted phylogenies from the ordinal binary characters of a nonordinal distance matrix.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, T can be recovered from T in O (n 2 log (n)) time. This generalizes the well-known fact that an unweighted phylogeny is characterized by its interspecies distances <ref> [Waterman et al. 1977] </ref>. So in fact, the relative magnitudes of an unweighted phylogeny's interspecies distances give as much information about the phylogeny as do the magnitudes of its interspecies distances. Clearly the relationship between a phylogeny T and the ordinal assertions supported by T is strong. <p> We also demonstrate that no four- or five-point condition characterization exists (x2.1). Additive matrices can be recognized optimally in O (n 2 ) time where n is the number of species <ref> [Culberson et al. 1989, Waterman et al. 1977] </ref>; in this paper we present an optimal O (n 2 ) recognition algorithm for ordinal matrices (x3).
