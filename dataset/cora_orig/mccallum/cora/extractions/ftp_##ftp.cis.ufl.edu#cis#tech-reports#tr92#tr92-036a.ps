Abstract: 3D Shape modeling has been a very prominent part of Computer Vision over the past decade. Several shape modeling techniques have been proposed in literature, some are local (distributed parameter) while others are global (lumped parameter) in terms of the parameters required to describe the shape. Hybrid models that combine both ends of this parameter spectrum have been in vogue only recently. However, they do not allow a smooth transition between the two extremes of this parameter spectrum. In this paper, we introduce a new shape modeling scheme that can transform smoothly from local to global models or vice-versa. The modeling scheme utilizes a hybrid primitive called the deformable superquadrics constructed in an orthonormal wavelet bases. These multi-resolution bases provide the power to continuously transform from local to global shape deformations and thereby allow for a continuum of shape models from those with local to those with global shape descriptive power - to be created. The characteristic of continuously transforming from local to global shape deformations allows us to generate fractal surfaces of arbitrary degree that can be useful in describing natural detail. We embed these multi-resolution shape models in a probabilistic framework and use them for segmenting anatomical structures in the human brain from MRI data. A salient feature of our modeling scheme is that it can naturally allow for the incorporation of prior statistics of a rich variety of shapes. This stems from the fact that, unlike other modeling schemes, in our modeling, we require relatively few parameters to describe a large class of shapes completely.

Some examples of lumped parameter models include, superquadrics <ref> [3, 12, 2] </ref> and the parametrically deformable models [23, 9].

For the parameterized reference shape s (u) we use the superquadrics with the bending deformation (as in <ref> [2] </ref>), due to it's attractive global shape characterization. The reference shape s is given by, s = B ( ~ s) (2) Where B is a bending deformation, a function of two parameters: the radius of curvature k and angle of the bending plane ff (see [2] for details). <p> bending deformation (as in <ref> [2] </ref>), due to it's attractive global shape characterization.

Reference-contexts: Shape reconstruction from sensed data requires a broad geometric coverage. The models must recover detailed structure from noisy data using only the weakest of the possible assumptions about the observed shapes. Generalized spline models with continuity constraints are well suited for fulfilling the goals of shape reconstruction (see <ref> [16, 4] </ref>). Generalized splines are the key ingredient of the dynamic shape modeling paradigm introduced by Terzopoulos et. al., [18]. Incorporating dynamics into shape modeling with generalized splines, allows for creating realistic animation for computer graphics applications and also for tracking moving objects in computer vision applications.
