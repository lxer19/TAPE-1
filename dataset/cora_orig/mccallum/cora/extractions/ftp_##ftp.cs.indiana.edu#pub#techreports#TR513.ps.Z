Abstract: A new class of digital halftoning algorithms is introduced. Anti-correlation digital halftoning (ACDH) combines the idea of a well-known game, Russian roulette, with the statistical approach to bilevel quantization of digital images. A representative of the class, serpentine anti-correlation digital halftoning, is described and compared to error diffusion, ordered dither, and other important digital halftoning techniques. Serpentine ACDH causes fewer unpleasant correlated artifacts and less contouring than the benchmark algorithms. The quantization noise spectra associated with serpentine ACDH possess beneficial characteristics related to properties of the vision system. The term "violet noise" is proposed to describe quantization noise with stronger bias in favor of high-frequency components than that of blue noise. Novel techniques for color visualization of the noise spectra and the corresponding phase spectra are introduced, and the relative significance of the magnitudes and phases of the discrete Fourier transform of the quantization noise is studied. Unlike popular algorithms based on error diffusion, serpentine ACDH does not enhance edges. This is good for applications to digital holography and medical imaging. A simple input preprocessing technique allows one to introduce edge enhancement if desired, while keeping it more isotropic than that of error diffusion. The relation between unwanted transient boundary effects and edge enhancement accompanying error diffusion is examined, and approaches to reduction of boundary effects are considered. Serpentine ACDH does not cause significant boundary effects. The average intensity representation by different algorithms is studied for constant input levels (serpentine ACDH does remarkably well). Prospects for ACDH research are discussed.

Reference-contexts: Overview of Digital Halftoning Techniques For the purposes of our discourse, we define the input of a digital halftoning algorithm to be a two-dimensional digital grayscale image G represented by an N 1 fi N 2 matrix of real values g i;j 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Most of the paper is devoted to the case of bilevel quantization where a binary image B represented by an N 1 fi N 2 matrix of b i;j 2 f0; 1g serves as output of the algorithm. <p> The method's internal parameter oe = 1:5, as recommended by Ulichney. An interesting generalization of ordered dither is called look-up-table (LUT) based halfton-ing [125, 209, 229]. In LUT based halftoning, the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is divided into non-intersecting subintervals, each of which is associated with an ` 1 fi ` 2 matrix of zeros and ones called a binary pattern, or a dot profile. <p> Here ln stands for the natural logarithm. Other researchers [56, 246] used more general transformations of the type l u;v = ln (1 + fiN (jf BG (u; v)j))=ln (1 + fi); (23) where N is a linear normalization function such that its output is always in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and fi is a constant between 4 and 70. The exact value of fi is given by the user and depends on the spectrum that has to be visualized. <p> Our manipulations with k and k 0 minimize the sums P n1 26 Delta-sigma (or sigma-delta) modulation [27, 155, 201] is a popular data transformation tech-nique applied in digital signal processing and communication systems. Single-loop delta-sigma modulation (more sophisticated configurations are known [33, 84]) over the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref> (linear transformations cover arbitrary ranges [j 1 ; j 2 ], j 1 &lt; j 2 ) of the input values g i 2 [0; 1], i = 1; 2; : : : ; N , can be described by the formula from [185] that determines the outputs of <p> Single-loop delta-sigma modulation (more sophisticated configurations are known [33, 84]) over the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref> (linear transformations cover arbitrary ranges [j 1 ; j 2 ], j 1 &lt; j 2 ) of the input values g i 2 [0; 1], i = 1; 2; : : : ; N , can be described by the formula from [185] that determines the outputs of the procedure, b i = 1 if g i + k=1 (g k b k ) 1=2, P i1 (68) Anastassiou [6] showed that delta-sigma modulation <p> Let hxi denote the fractional part of x. Then the coordinates in the RGB color space (each of them in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>) can be computed as follows. <p> While the apparent reduction in edge enhancement was achieved, no results of measurements similar to those conducted by Knox [107] for step functions were reported, so it remained unclear just how well their pre-blurring technique worked. The intensity values of the modified image can sometimes wander outside the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, causing problems with stability of the error diffusion algorithm. <p> Instead, highly visible peaks emerge in the distributions for g = 1=4, g = 1=2, and g = 3=4. In the meanwhile, Fig. 37 (a) suggests convergence to other (non-uniform) distributions such that E ( i;j ) = g. For the case of the constant input g 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, Eqs. (1,2,5) yield * i;j = g + s i;j bg + s i;j + 1=2c; (95) i.e., * i;j are linked to s i;j so that the distributions of errors are uniquely determined by the distributions of the sums of weighted errors. <p> as follows. g 0 g i;j (1 ff 1 ) + ff 1 (g i;j g i;j (3; 3)) = g i;j + ff 2 (g i;j g i;j (3; 3)): (102) From Eq. (102), it is obvious that g 0 i;j are not guaranteed to stay within the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Many digital halftoning techniques are capable of handling such input, ordered dither and error diffusion among them. However, no ACDH algorithm can process input values outside [0; 1], where the meanings of the input intensity values 0 and 1 are as defined in Section 2. <p> i;j (3; 3)): (102) From Eq.

However, no ACDH algorithm can process input values outside [0; 1], where the meanings of the input intensity values 0 and 1 are as defined in Section 2. Luckily, a simple modification takes care of the problem. <p> the RGB cube), and the color palette consists of all triples of the form (k 1 =q 1 ; k 2 =q 2 ; k 3 =q 3 ), where q 1 , q 2 , and q 3 are positive integers, each color coordinate is normalized to fit in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, k 1 = 0; 1; : : : ; q 1 , k 2 = 0; 1; : : : ; q 2 , and k 3 = 0; 1; : : : ; q 3 .

By then, important results had been obtained in a number of psychophysical experiments concerned with visual detectability of gratings. <p> While it proved straightforward to eliminate any given periodic pattern by changing the coefficients of anti-correlation filters, other unwanted textures would often emerge instead, so I had to perform multiple "trial-and-error" cycles similar to those described in <ref> [2] </ref>. In addition to that, it turned out that some patterns suppressed in the halftone ramp may occasionally surface in test images with more gradient.

Reference-contexts: The MSE is well-known to be incompatible with human sensory perception <ref> [6, 103, 135, 136] </ref>, and explanations of this fact exist [172, 185]. Still, the MSE (SNR) is often used because of its simplicity, and because it is possible to calculate the rate-distortion function and simulate the optimum encoding scheme for it [135]. <p> values g i 2 [0; 1], i = 1; 2; : : : ; N , can be described by the formula from [185] that determines the outputs of the procedure, b i = 1 if g i + k=1 (g k b k ) 1=2, P i1 (68) Anastassiou <ref> [6] </ref> showed that delta-sigma modulation can be interpreted as one-dimensional error-diffusion, and, conversely, that one-weight error diffusion with W = 0 0 0 can easily be modified to coincide with line-by-line delta-sigma modulation (the error accumulated at the end of one line should be transferred to the beginning of the next <p> Note that, while rather strict conditions have to be imposed on error diffusion coefficients w o 1 ;o 2 to ensure numerical stability <ref> [6, 54, 230] </ref>, making sure that the computation of sums from Eq. (71) never causes an overflow is enough to achieve stability when designing anti-correlation filters. As a result, it is relatively simple to break up any unwanted regular binary pattern or correlated artifact by adjusting K.

Reference-contexts: We will call the graphs of the TSA functions the tone scale adjustment curves, because of their shape. Some authors draw distinctions between brightness and lightness <ref> [15, 100, 166] </ref>, Pratt mixes the two notions ([172], Subsection 7.3.1). The perceived brightness (lightness) of an image area is hard to compute exactly even if the values of such parameters as the area's own luminance, the luminance of background/surround, the luminances of "white" and "black", etc. are known. <p> The ramps that measure close to being linear in reflection density seem too dark to me, so I doubt that the perceived brightness is linear in reflection density. (Note that if it were, the coefficient of D r would have to be negative.) Bartleson and Breneman <ref> [15] </ref> conducted subjective measurements to determine how the perceived brightness P in complex images (photographic reproductions and transparencies) depends on luminance L. <p> My measurements conducted outdoors on a sunny afternoon yielded L b = 512, L w = 7790. However, the values of c 1 (L w ) and c 2 (L w ) do not change all that much within the photopic range. From a graph in <ref> [15] </ref>, I estimated c 1 (L w ) = c 1 (169) = 2 and c 2 (L w ) = c 2 (169) = 0:28 for the case of the bright surround.

Reference-contexts: Mitsa and Parker [147] used Ulichney's concept of blue noise [218], which is going to be discussed in detail in the next section, to design dither matrices they called blue noise masks (these matrices are also known as stochastic screens <ref> [37] </ref>). Other approaches to blue noise mask generation were proposed by Ulichney [221] (the popular void-and-cluster method) and other researchers [129, 130, 199, 243]. Images in Figures 4 (a) and (c) were obtained by ordered dither with a 128 fi 128 blue noise mask generated using the void-and-cluster method. <p> The visual representation of an N 1 fi N 2 matrix of e i;j would then become a noise image (Dalton <ref> [37] </ref> used this term with a different meaning).

Reference-contexts: An intensity value 0 means "black", and 1 means "white". It may be difficult to translate the intermediate intensity values into physically measurable quantities. We will return to this problem later in this paper. Other sources may assign other meanings to the word "intensity" <ref> [66, 100] </ref>.

Ulichney's definition seemed too narrow to be adequate, so other researchers attempted to change it, adding more bias in favor of high frequencies <ref> [70, 113] </ref> and introducing orientational dependency otherwise ignored in the process of radial averaging [113]. Adding to the confusion, FS-1037C [223] defined blue noise as follows: "In a spectrum of frequencies, a region in which the spectral density, i.e., power per hertz, is proportional to the frequency". <p> I propose that the name violet noise is given to a spectral region where the spectral density increases with increasing (radial) frequency. This would give us a convenient general definition incorporating purple noise, blue noise 22 of FS-1037C, modified blue noise from [113], parts of modified blue noise from <ref> [70] </ref>, but not blue noise as defined by Ulichney, or green noise. Ample experimental evidence suggests that good halftoning algorithms produce radially asymmetric violet noise, possibly with flat spectrum parts included.

Reference-contexts: The physical contrast of simple images such as sinusoidal gratings or single patches of light on a uniform background is well defined and agrees with the perceived contrast, but this is not so for complex images [167].

Reference-contexts: Alas, this measure does not depend on the viewing conditions (lighting, resolution, viewing distance, etc.) | in particular, sizes of filters used to separate images into regions are expressed in pixels and fixed. Hosaka <ref> [88] </ref> and Eskicioglu [52] developed multidimensional measures of image quality based on quadtree decomposition of the original image into certain activity regions. Eski-cioglu reported that his dc-shift-invariant measure captures notions like "blockiness" and "blurri-ness".

Halftone Image Quality Evaluation No single technique of image quality evaluation has gained universal acceptance [35]. In this section, we will introduce some essential definitions and then consider different approaches to measurement of halftone image quality.

Reference-contexts: Digital halftoning [218] means image quantization by algorithms that exploit properties of the vision system to create the illusion of continuous tone. Many related neurobiological aspects of vision are discussed in <ref> [91] </ref>. Digital halftoning has been applied in such areas as digital holography [191], desktop publishing [202], medical imaging [164, 184], image compression/restoration [87], non-uniform sampling [144], video rendering [222], pattern recognition [80], verification of monochrome vision models [78, 128], and three-dimensional computer graphics [206].

In the recent years, a lot of interest was paid to color image sequence quantization [8, 67, 179]. Studies of color image quality <ref> [30, 92, 116, 148, 197, 215] </ref> are often closely related to the color quantization problem. Two essential steps in color quantization are color palette design [12, 93, 115] and mapping the available color gamut to the color palette.

Reference-contexts: Then the corresponding modulation transfer function (MTF) H can be defined [172] to be an N 1 fi N 2 matrix such that jF (Y )j = H ffi jF (X)j: (28) Components of H will be denoted by h (u; v). (Jain <ref> [95] </ref> gave a different definition of the MTF | he normalized it with regard to h (0; 0).)

The MSE is well-known to be incompatible with human sensory perception [6, 103, 135, 136], and explanations of this fact exist [172, 185].

Reference-contexts: Subsequent modifications of ED employed the following main approaches: design a different kernel W <ref> [56, 96, 218] </ref>; change the order in which the pixels are processed [34, 218, 224, 232, 253] (this usually involves a change of W as well; sometimes, features of other digital halftoning techniques are also incorporated [34, 253]); randomize W [113, 218]; make W input-dependent [48, 233, 234]; substitute a binary <p> In a later paper [108], he demonstrated that the edge enhancement was even stronger in the 12-weight error diffusion algorithm by Jarvis, Judice, and Ninke <ref> [96] </ref>, but could not be detected in the halftone images produced using line-by-line delta-sigma modulation. Knox [108] gave a partial explanation of the phenomenon, linking it to a component linear in the input image G being present in the error image. This component is subjected to high-pass filtering.
