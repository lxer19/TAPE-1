Abstract: The Building-Block Hypothesis appeals to the notion of problem decomposition and the assembly of solutions from sub-solutions. Accordingly, there have been many varieties of GA test problems with a structure based on building-blocks. Many of these problems use deceptive fitness functions to model interdependency between the bits within a block. However, very few have any model of interdependency between building-blocks; those that do are not consistent in the type of interaction used intra-block and inter-block. This paper discusses the inadequacies of the various test problems in the literature and clarifies the concept of building-block interdependency. We formulate a principled model of hierarchical interdependency that can be applied through many levels in a consistent manner and introduce Hierarchical If-and-only-if (H-IFF) as a canonical example. We present some empirical results of GAs on H-IFF showing that if population diversity is maintained and linkage is tight then the GA is able to identify and manipulate building-blocks over many levels of assembly, as the Building-Block Hypothesis suggests.

Reference-contexts: Yet there has been much controversy over whether the GA can identify and manipulate sub-solutions or building-blocks appropriately ((Forrest & Mitchell, 1993b), (Goldberg and Horn, 1994), <ref> (Mitchell et al., 1995) </ref>). Much of this controversy arises from the inadequacy of test problems in the literature and in turn this inadequacy arises from lack of clarity on the seemingly straight-forward concept of problem decomposition. <p> We will be looking for a consistent hierarchical problem that exhibits modular sub-problems and interdependency between these sub-problems. Whitley et al. <ref> (1995 and 1995b) </ref>, provide a review of test-problems from the GA literature and summarize, most common test problems used in the past to evaluate genetic algorithms lack the inclusion of strong non-linear dependencies between state variables. <p> There are several building-block style functions - the Royal Road (RR) functions (Mitchell et al., 1992, Forrest & Mitchell, 1993), revised Royal Road functions (Holland 1993), <ref> (see also, Jones, 1995) </ref>, concatenated trap functions (Deb & Goldberg, 1992), and others - that clearly emphasize a gross-scale building-block structure. But, like the real-valued functions that Whitley investigated, these consist of concatenated blocks, each of which may be optimized independently in a cumulative fashion. <p> Goldberg et al. (1993) acknowledge that they have "temporarily ignored the possibility of subfunction crosstalk. Crosstalk, is defined by Kargupta <ref> (1995) </ref> as a property of both the algorithm and the landscape and appeals to the idea that the algorithm may be misled in identifying building-blocks by changes in fitness contribution. Accordingly, Goldberg et al. suggest that noise in the fitness function may be an appropriate model for crosstalk. <p> We favor a definition of building-block dependency that is not reliant on the algorithm being used - specifically, the observation that the optimal bit-setting for a block is different in one context than in another is algorithm independent. Whitley et al. <ref> (1995) </ref> argue for test-problems that have non-separable components, and propose an expansion method for constructing scaleable non-separable functions from a non-linear base function of two variables. <p> These algorithms are each applied to a standard 64-bit H-IFF and a bit-shuffled H-IFF, both with and without fitness-sharing. The bit-shuffled H-IFF (a standard H-IFF with random bit-ordering) demonstrates that the GA's ability to manipulate building-blocks with crossover is dependent on the heuristic of bit-adjacency <ref> (see linkage disequalibrium, Altenberg 1995) </ref>. The fitness-sharing method is used to enforce diversity since any algorithm that is to explore the space of solutions properly will need to maintain both solutions to a block at least as long as it takes to find the solution at the next level. <p> RMHC is run for 10 6 evaluations. 2) GA-2: GA with 2 point crossover: 1000 individuals are run for 1000 generations. Elitism of 1% is used. The ranking function uses Michalewiczs exponential scaling with 0.01 for the value that determines the selection pressure <ref> (Michalewicz, 1995) </ref>. Two-point crossover is used with a probability of 0.3. <p> Two-point crossover is used with a probability of 0.3. Mutation as per RMHC. 3) GA-U: GA with uniform crossover: Other parameters as per GA-2. 4) HCT: Headless Chicken Test: The headless chicken test <ref> (Jones, 1995) </ref> is a GA in all respects except that when cross-over is performed one of the parents is an entirely random string which thus replaces whole chunks of the genotype with random bits whilst leaving other sections intact.

Reference-contexts: There are several building-block style functions - the Royal Road (RR) functions (Mitchell et al., 1992, Forrest & Mitchell, 1993), revised Royal Road functions <ref> (Holland 1993) </ref>, (see also, Jones, 1995), concatenated trap functions (Deb & Goldberg, 1992), and others - that clearly emphasize a gross-scale building-block structure.

The R1 version of the Royal Roads problem <ref> (Forrest & Mitchell, 1993) </ref>, for example, can be imagined as a staircase leading search in a stepwise fashion in the correct direction. In concatenated trap functions and the revised Royal Road functions, the fitness gradient leads search away from the solution to each block. <p> To continue the analogy, although each tread on the stair is inclined unfavorably the whole staircase still leads to the global optima. The R2 function, <ref> (Forrest & Mitchell, 1993) </ref>, and the revised Royal Road functions make hierarchy explicit. However the interactions between bits within the first level blocks are very different from the interactions between blocks in subsequent levels. <p> Although the fitness contributions of the base-level blocks accumulate non-linearly because of 'bonus' contributions from higher levels the blocks are still separable in that the optimal bit-setting for a block does not change. Goldberg et al. <ref> (1993) </ref> acknowledge that they have "temporarily ignored the possibility of subfunction crosstalk. Crosstalk, is defined by Kargupta (1995) as a property of both the algorithm and the landscape and appeals to the idea that the algorithm may be misled in identifying building-blocks by changes in fitness contribution. <p> They also propose that using all possible pairs, rather than a minimal set of overlapping pairs, provides a method to vary the amount of interdependency. This notion has some similarities with the NK landscapes of Kauffman <ref> (1993) </ref>. The NK landscapes certainly do model the interdependency of variables - the contribution of each of N variables is defined as a random look-up function of itself and k other variables. <p> Our preliminary work explored varieties of the NK model that cluster the variables into groups with many intra-group dependencies and few inter-group dependencies - an idea inspired by the dependency matrices used by Simon (1969). Goldberg et al <ref> (1993) </ref>, also suggests adding changes in fitness according to "the presence or absence of bit combinations across subfunction boundaries". But this method does not provide a principled hierarchical structure - merely a clustered, single-level one. <p> Forrest and Mitchell (1993b, and Mitchell et al, 1995) use random mutation hill-climbing (RMHC) to demonstrate that the RR functions are not appropriate test-functions for GAs. Likewise, Jones <ref> (1993 pp. 57-58) </ref> demonstrates that the revised RR functions and the concatenated trap-functions are inappropriate by applying the "Headless Chicken Test" (HCT) (a hill-climber that uses macro-mutations). Thus RMHC and HCT are chosen for comparison against the standard GA (both two-point and uniform crossover).
