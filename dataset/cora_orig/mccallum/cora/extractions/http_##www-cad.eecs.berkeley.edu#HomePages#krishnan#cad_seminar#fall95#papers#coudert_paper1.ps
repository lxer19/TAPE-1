Title: Global Sizing: A General Purpose Optimization Approach  
Abstract: Although at the end of the synthesis process, gate resizing has a significant impact on the delay, power dissipation, and area of the final circuit. Exploiting the variety of a library to optimize some cost functions has been previously addressed with a number of assumptions that makes these approaches difficult to apply on real-life large circuits. This paper presents a gate sizing based optimization technique with the following characteristics. It does not assume any continuous parameter, but is rather oriented to a pure combinatorial optimization, which is the fundamental aspect of the gate sizing problem. It addresses non linear, non unimodal, constrained optimization, which enable it to use any cost model, in particular an accurate lookup table interpolation based non linear delay model. It can take into account user defined or library dependent design rules (e.g, maximal transition time, maximal fanout load). It can be applied on large circuits within a reasonable CPU time, e.g., 15000 nodes in 2 hours. It is a general purpose optimizer, e.g., it can optimize the power and/or area under some delay constraints, or more originally, the delay under some power and/or area constraints.

Reference-contexts: time of a gate is nothing but the output transition time of its fanin gates. 2 The timing models where delays depend only on the output load fo and on an intrinsic delay t p are not accurate enough, since the delays is input transition time (t i ) sensitive <ref> [1, 33, 25, 17, 28] </ref>. Moreover, an extensive study of different input transition time sensitive delay models shows that a table lookup approach is more accurate than multi-coefficient (linear, polynomial, or posynomial) approximations [18].
