Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Asymptotic Waveform Evaluation (AWE) is a recently developed technique for acquiring low-order approximations for large, linearized circuits <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. Such a circuit is generally described by the set of state space equations _x = Ax + bu and y = cx + du (1) where A is a square, sparse matrix of size n 1, b is a column vector, and c is a row vector. <p> In finite precision, the information corresponding to the other eigenvectors will be lost in the higher moments. Regardless of how many moments are matched in this situation, the computed approximation never converges to the original circuit (see <ref> [1, example 1] </ref>). To contend with this difficulty, [1] suggests working around the problem by attempting to appropriately shift the moments. If forming a certain type of moment emphasizes an extreme eigenvalue of A, one must select other types of moments which emphasize information from other portions of the spectrum. <p> In finite precision, the information corresponding to the other eigenvectors will be lost in the higher moments.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Asymptotic Waveform Evaluation (AWE) is a recently developed technique for acquiring low-order approximations for large, linearized circuits <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. Such a circuit is generally described by the set of state space equations _x = Ax + bu and y = cx + du (1) where A is a square, sparse matrix of size n 1, b is a column vector, and c is a row vector. <p> This section explores these issues in greater detail. 3.1. Sensitivity of the Realization In past AWE papers <ref> [2] </ref>, the reduced-order model is expressed via the partial fraction expansion (PFE) of (3) ^ h (s) = j=1 s p j where the poles, p j , are the (assumed unique) roots of the denominator of (3) and the coefficients, r j , are denoted as the residuals. <p> Compared to cA i b, the value of cb will be zero in finite precision, resulting in a situation where realizations of size i cannot be computed. To overcome this difficulty, <ref> [2] </ref> proposes scaling the matrix, A. Unfortunately, scaling does not address a second difficulty inherent to computing matrix-vector products containing increasing powers of A. Consider an A with one eigenvalue, 1 , significantly larger than the others.

Stability of the Approximation When moment matching is employed, the reduced-order model for a stable circuits may be unstable <ref> [17] </ref>. To handle this problem, existing AWE papers prescribe searching the Pade table until a stable realization is located. Although such a technique must eventually succeed for a sufficiently large k, it is both heuristic and potentially expensive.

Reference-contexts: One cannot know a priori how many realizations must be generated before a stable one is acquired. Moreover, when a stable realization is determined, its size may exceed some desired value. As an alternative to searching the Pade table, <ref> [18] </ref> stabilizes a realization of specified size k by incorporating implicit restarts into the Lanczos algorithm. <p> Strategies for choosing the parameters i in (13) can be employed to insure that this extra information stabilizes the partial realization. Examples in <ref> [18] </ref> demonstrate that when properly employed, implicit restarts can stabilize a realization with negligible computational effort. 80 K. Gallivan et al. 3.4. Singularities in the Pade Table Singularities can occur in the Pade table. Where these singularities exist, partial realizations (2) will not be possible.

Reference-contexts: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this issue is not addressed in previous AWE papers. Yet the occurrence of ill-conditioned table entries is well-studied in the Lanczos algorithm, where it is termed a "serious" breakdown. By employing "look-ahead" into the Lanczos method, <ref> [19] </ref>, one possesses a powerful tool for detecting and avoiding ill-conditioned table entries. 4. CONCLUDING REMARKS Both explicit moment matching and the Lanczos method are efficient techniques for generating partial realizations.
