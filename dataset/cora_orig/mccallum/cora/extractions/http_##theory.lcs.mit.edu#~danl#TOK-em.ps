Title: Trivial or Knot: A Software Tool and Algorithms for Knot Simplification  
Author: Daniel Lewin Orli Gan Alfred Bruckstein 
Abstract: A special type of representation for knots and for local knot manipulations is described and used in a software tool called TOK to implement a number of algorithms on knots. Two algorithms for knot simplification are described: simulated annealing applied to the knot representation, and a divide-simplify-join algorithm. Both of these algorithms make use of the compact knot representation and of the basic mechanism TOK provides for carrying out a predefined knot manipulation on the knot representation. The simplification algorithms implemented with the TOK system exploit local knot manipulations and have proven themselves effective for simplifying even very complicated knots in reasonable time.

Reference-contexts: In order to develop such a theory a notion of diagram equivalence must be introduced. Most importantly diagram equivalence should imply, and be implied by, equivalence (through ambient isotopy) of the knots that they represent.

Reference-contexts: Another popular definition is a closed, simple polygonal curve in euclidean three-space. In either case a knot is pictured as a string in euclidean three-space. Equivalence of knots is usually defined up to a type of movement called ambient isotopy (see <ref> [Burde and Zieschang 85] </ref>). Equivalence by ambient isotopy of two knots means that there is a continuous deformation, via embeddings, from one embedding to the other. This type of deformation is sometimes called a level preserving isotopy.

Reference-contexts: The knot representation of the knot in Figure 5 (a) is: [0,7][4,1][2,9][8,3][10,5][6,11] There is a one-to-one correspondence between this knot representation and the Dowker representation <ref> [Dowker and Thistlethwaite 83] </ref> which is a reinvention of a knot notation suggested by Gauss. In order to obtain the Dowker notation from our notation read off the pair of each segment starting with zero. For example the Dowker representation of the above knot is 7,4,9,8,1,10,11,0,3,2,5,6. <p> In order to obtain the Dowker notation from our notation read off the pair of each segment starting with zero. For example the Dowker representation of the above knot is 7,4,9,8,1,10,11,0,3,2,5,6. Theorem 3 The above knot representation is well defined. This follows directly from Theorem 1 in <ref> [Dowker and Thistlethwaite 83] </ref> by breaking the knot into apparently prime sections and applying the theorem to each section. Note that the same list of crossings may represent a number of knot diagrams that all represent equivalent knots, or knot mirror images. <p> Two examples of such algorithms have been described. The knot simplification algorithms using TOK proved to be effective at simplifying very complicated knots. Further applications of the tool include building a tabulation of knot types by deciding knot equivalence with algorithms built on the TOK framework (e.g. as in <ref> [Dowker and Thistlethwaite 83] </ref>). The rule definition that has been presented can describe a wide range of manipulations. We note that there are knot algorithms (such as computation of the HOMFLY polynomial) which require knot manipulations that cannot be represented by our current syntax and application algorithm.

Reference-contexts: However, most invariants known do not distinguish between all distinct knot classes. Furthermore, most invariants are difficult to calculate. Recently, new polynomial invariants (e.g. the HOMFLY polynomial <ref> [Freyd, Yetter, Hoste, Lickorish, Millet and Ocneanu 85] </ref>) which are both powerful, and relatively easy to calculate have been introduced. The HOMFLY polynomial (and related polynomials) are very powerful knot invariants, and are capable of differentiating between many knot classes.

Reference-contexts: Electric charge is assumed to be distributed over the knot and the resulting potential energy of the system is called the energy of the knot. The canonical form is an equivalent knot that has minimal energy. It was conjectured in <ref> [Fukuhara 88] </ref> that this knot form is unique, and may thus be a good candidate for a canonical form. Simulated annealing has been applied in [Ligocki and Sethian 94] to find this minimal energy knot. The annealing procedure was applied to knots represented by a piecewise linear curve in . <p> The Energy Function In [Ligocki and Sethian 94] simulated annealing was applied to a knot represented as a piecewise-linear curve. Two energy functions were used: electrostatic energy (as in <ref> [Fukuhara 88] </ref>) and geometric energy. Both these energy functions are heavily based on the three dimensional representation of the knot, as they rely on the notion of distance. In each case the least energetic knot is what we would intuitively describe as the most simple representation of the knot.

Reference-contexts: The canonical form is an equivalent knot that has minimal energy. It was conjectured in [Fukuhara 88] that this knot form is unique, and may thus be a good candidate for a canonical form. Simulated annealing has been applied in <ref> [Ligocki and Sethian 94] </ref> to find this minimal energy knot. The annealing procedure was applied to knots represented by a piecewise linear curve in . We present in this paper a software tool for representing and manipulating knots. <p> The platform may be used as a basis for implementing a variety of algorithms for manipulating knots. As a demonstration, a new simulated annealing algorithm that simplifies knots is implemented. The annealing algorithm exhibited good behavior for many large knots including those shown in <ref> [Ligocki and Sethian 94] </ref>. In addition, a divide-simplify-join knot simplification algorithm is described which also shows promise for simplifying very large knots. <p> The algorithm has been applied to large knots and has been shown to be effective at simplifying even very complicated knots. We note that annealing has been applied before to three dimensional models of knots <ref> [Ligocki and Sethian 94] </ref>. The advantage of our algorithm is that our representation strips away all information that is not relevant to the topology, or the knottedness of the knot, so the state space is much smaller. <p> In order to apply annealing we must define three things: the energy function, how the knot is perturbed, and the cooling process. The Energy Function In <ref> [Ligocki and Sethian 94] </ref> simulated annealing was applied to a knot represented as a piecewise-linear curve. Two energy functions were used: electrostatic energy (as in [Fukuhara 88]) and geometric energy. <p> In this way the effect of large changes at higher temperatures, and smaller, more modest changes at lower temperatures is obtained. Cooling An effect that was noticed also in <ref> [Ligocki and Sethian 94] </ref> is that the cooling process becomes very slow after the initial drop in the temperature because of the logarithmic decrease in the temperature. <p> A simple TOK macro applies a Reid3 type move and then reduces crossings with any Reid1 or Reid2 type moves possible. This sequence is repeated until no further simplification is obtained. For example, all of the knots given as examples in <ref> [Ligocki and Sethian 94] </ref> were completely simplified using this systematic method. Annealing is needed for very complicated knots, although in the same amount of time the systematic method also shows good behavior for some knots.

Reference-contexts: Moreover the regular projections are generic, i.e. we would have to have some bad luck to see a non-regular projection. Theorem 1 : Every (tame) knot has a regular projection. In addition, the set of regular projections is dense in the set of all projections. (see <ref> [Livingston 93] </ref>) Theorem 1 allows us to use knot projections without fear that we are restricting our scope. Moreover, the theorem states that finding a regular projection by perturbing an existing (possibly non-regular) projection has a high probability of success. A knot diagram is a regular projection of the knot.

Reference-contexts: Thus, improving the algorithm for deciding irreducibility would be an important, further contribution to the simplification algorithm. Since we have an efficient algorithm for deciding if a diagram is apparently prime, we may derive an even stronger result from the last statement of theorem 4 using the following theorem, <ref> [Menasco 84] </ref>. Theorem 5 (W. Menasco): An alternating diagram represents a prime knot iff it is apparently prime. 0 2 f 1 1 = f 3 3 = A 0 2, -= K 2 2 3,[ ]= IRREDUCIBLE (K) 1.
