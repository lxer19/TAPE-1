Abstract: Driving a car involves considering it at different spatio-temporal scales, and somehow leads to behavior such as the parallel parking maneuver, the three-point turn, free Euclidean driving in a desert, following a road, and translationally passing other vehicles at high speed. In the study of autonomous systems, it is desirable to find a representation in which such different behaviors of a single system can be related to each other, and to find precisely how and under what conditions a change of representation and corresponding choice of motions occurs. In this paper, we formulate an abstraction mechanism based on approximations of flows of commutators of vector fields. We apply it to the goal-directed motion of a car and show how the environmental constraints induce, through this abstraction mechanism, a recognizable hierarchy of descriptions of the car's motion.

Reference-contexts: Flows of commutators, see text. of variables, such as the maximum steering angle of the actual car, or obstacles (which interact with the shape of the car to make certain values of (x; y; ) unattainable, see e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>). But there are also constraints which relate to the dynamic behavior of a car, such as a maximum acceleration and a maximum permissible centripetal acceleration. In this way, the car's own motion, its construction, and the environment limit the flow in C-space.

Reference-contexts: After a Turn, the car has changed orientation, so a subsequent Straight does change the y 0 relative to the original coordinates. Proper computation of the vector fields now needs to take into account the covariant derivative, describing the differential coordinate transformation (this is standard differential geometry, see e.g. <ref> [2] </ref>). It may seem strange that we invoke Wriggle, which involves driving in the reverse direction.

Reference-contexts: We describe the motions that are a consequence of these controls by means of two vector fields in C, which we call Steer and Drive (following the terminology in <ref> [3] </ref>). <p> Each vector field can be interpreted as a derivative acting on scalar functions, with as its value at each point: the value of the derivative of that function in the direction of the local vector, see e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>. Thus if the components of the vector field A in a coordinate system fx i g are A i , then the action of A on a scalar function f , denoted Af , is: Af = P @ @x i f . <p> In fact, the elementary interpretation of the flow [A;B] of such a new field [A; B], constructed as the Lie product of two vector fields A and B, is found by expressing it in the flows of A and B, as follows (see [5], <ref> [3] </ref>): [A;B] (t)p = lim p p p p n In words, eq.(6) means that one can move in the field [A; B] by concatenating infinitesimal moves in A and B in the order: first against (the flow of) A, then against B, then with (the flow of) A, then with <p> By computing the Lie products of the fields Steer and Drive using eq.(2.4), recursively, one finds new fields which we dub Wriggle and Slide (following <ref> [3] </ref>): [Steer; Drive] = sin ( + ) e x + cos ( + ) e y + cos e Wriggle; (7) [Steer; Wriggle] = cos ( + )e x sin ( + )e y + sin e = Drive; (8) [Wriggle; Drive] = 1 ( sin e x + cos <p> The name Wriggle is slightly unfortunate since it describes the motion rather than its result, which is mostly a change of orientation; we maintain it mainly to be consistent with <ref> [3] </ref>.) Since computation shows that: [Slide; Steer] = [Slide; Drive] = [Slide; Wriggle] = 0, there are no other fields that can be constructed by taking Lie products.

Reference-contexts: In fact, the elementary interpretation of the flow [A;B] of such a new field [A; B], constructed as the Lie product of two vector fields A and B, is found by expressing it in the flows of A and B, as follows (see <ref> [5] </ref>, [3]): [A;B] (t)p = lim p p p p n In words, eq.(6) means that one can move in the field [A; B] by concatenating infinitesimal moves in A and B in the order: first against (the flow of) A, then against B, then with (the flow of) A, then <p> Indeed, we conjecture that very reasonable approximate results for small t are obtained by taking n = 1. We have not been able to find (a source for) a proof of this conjecture; though the derivation in <ref> [5] </ref> based on exponential operators might be modified to yield this proof. We are led to consider such simplified flows by the optimality principle, which asks that goal-directed paths be reasonably short.
