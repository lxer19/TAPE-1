Title: The Instantaneous Kinematics and Planning of Dextrous Manipulation  
Author: L. Han J.C.Trinkle Z.X. Li TAMU TAMU HKUST 
Abstract: Dextrous manipulation is a problem of paramount importance in the study of multifingered robotic hands. In this paper, we derive in detail the kinematic relations between the finger joint velocities and object/contact velocity. The problem of dextrous manipulation is precisely formulated and cast in a form suitable for integrating relevant theory of nonholonomic motion planning, potential field methods and grasp stability to develop a general technique for dextrous manipulation planning with multifingered hands.
