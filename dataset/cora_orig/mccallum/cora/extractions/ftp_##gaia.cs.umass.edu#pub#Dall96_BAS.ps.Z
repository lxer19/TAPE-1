Abstract: Queueing networks with fork/join mechanisms and finite-capacity buffers are of interest because they are suited to modeling and evaluating the performance of a large class of discrete event systems such as manufacturing systems (e.g., manufacturing flow lines, assembly lines, kanban controlled manufacturing systems). In a recent paper, Dallery, Liu and Towsley [14] considered a special class of queueing networks with fork/join mechanisms and finite-capacity buffers called Basic Fork/Join Queueing Networks with Blocking (B-FJQN/B). For this class of networks, they established duality, reversibility, symmetry and concavity properties. However, in order to be able to accurately model the various operating mechanisms (blocking, loading and unloading mechanisms) encountered in manufacturing systems, it is necessary to consider a larger class of networks that will be referred to as Fork/Join Queueing Networks with Blocking (FJQN/B). The purpose of this paper is to introduce this class of queueing networks and investigate its properties. The approach is to first show that any FJQN/B can be equivalently represented as a B-FJQN/B and then use results derived in [14] for the underlying B-FJQN/B to establish the properties of the model under consideration. This approach is also used to compare the behavior of two models having different operating mechanisms. The usefulness of these results for performance evaluation and optimization of manufacturing systems is illustrated through a few examples.

(In that paper, the independent and simultaneous loading policies were called push and pull modes).

Reference-contexts: One important parameter of this system is its production capacity, which is defined as its throughput assuming that raw parts are always available in front of machines M 1 and M 2 . This system is considered in <ref> [7] </ref>. In that paper, the authors note that there is no equivalence between this assembly system and a three-machine serial line with a BAS blocking mechanism. This is indeed true. <p> Let us illustrate the usefulness of the results presented in this paper for addressing performance evaluation. For that purpose, consider again the simple assembly system presented in Section IV-A. In <ref> [7] </ref>, Baker et al. use an exact solution of the underlying Markov chain to calculate performance parameters. However, they only consider the simple case with no intermediate buffers and exponentially distributed service times at the three machines.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a tractable analysis needs to rely on an approximation method. Now, a very accurate decomposition method for tandem queueing networks with finite buffers and blocking before service was proposed in <ref> [8] </ref>. The equivalence result of Theorem IV.1 allows us to use this method to analyze the equivalent serial line and then transpose the results obtained to the assembly system. The results presented in this paper are also useful for optimization purposes.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the production capacity is still maximized with a number of pallets equal to half of the total capacity of the loop. C. Kanban Controlled Production Lines Consider a production line operating using a kanban control mechanism; see e.g. <ref> [9] </ref>, [19]. The production line consists of a series of L machines, M 1 , M 2 ,..., M L , decomposed into N stages. <p> This is a performance measure of great interest since it corresponds to the maximum (average) rate of external demands that can be satisfied <ref> [9] </ref>, [19]. In other words, it provides the stability condition of the kanban controlled production line. This kanban controlled production line can be modeled as a FJQN/B [19]. The set of servers are the L machines and the N 1 synchronization stations. <p> Moreover, it is easy to check that they also hold if the buffers in between consecutive machines within a stage have finite capacity. Variations around this kanban control mechanism have been described in the literature see e.g. <ref> [9] </ref>, [11]. IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION, TO APPEAR 20 In each case, it is possible to model the resulting system as a FJQN/B and apply the results derived in this paper.

Reference-contexts: III. Properties of FJQN/Bs In this section, we establish properties of FJQN/Bs. These properties pertain to the asymptotic throughput of B-FJQN/Bs and are obtained by converting an arbitrary FJQN/B into an equivalent B-FJQN/B as described in Section II-C together with the properties of B-FJQN/Bs established in <ref> [14] </ref>. They require one or more of the following assumptions on the sequences of service times. Assumption A1. The service times form jointly stationary and ergodic sequences of integrable random variables (r.v.'s). Assumption A2. The sequences of service times at different servers are mutually independent. Assumption A3. <p> Assumption A2. The sequences of service times at different servers are mutually independent. Assumption A3. The sequences of service times are jointly reversible. Assumption A4. The service times form mutually independent sequences of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) r.v.'s having PERT distributions [4], <ref> [14] </ref>. It is worth emphasizing that the first three assumptions include the case where the service times are i.i.d. r.v.'s as a special case. Assumption A4 is more restrictive but includes exponential and Erlang distributions as special cases. <p> This will allow us to keep the notation as simple as possible. However, all of the results that we present generalize to other initial conditions. Throughout this section, we only consider deadlock-free FJQN/Bs. Whether or not a FJQN/B is deadlock-free can be checked by verifying the conditions given in <ref> [14] </ref> on the equivalent B-FJQN/Bs. IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION, TO APPEAR 13 A. Throughput Consider a FJQN/B S = (V; E; B; M ; T ). The following result establishes the existence of the asymptotic throughputs of the servers of a FJQN/B, as well as their equality. <p> Throughput Consider a FJQN/B S = (V; E; B; M ; T ). The following result establishes the existence of the asymptotic throughputs of the servers of a FJQN/B, as well as their equality. It is a consequence of Theorem 5.2 in <ref> [14] </ref> and the equivalence of FJQN/Bs and B-FJQN/Bs. Theorem III.1: If S is a FJQN/B, then, under Assumption A1, the asymptotic throughputs exist and satisfy the following relation: i (S) = (S); 8i 2 V: Henceforth, (S) will be referred to as the throughput of S. <p> The following result establishes the independence of the throughput of a FJQN/B with respect to equivalent initial markings. It is a consequence of Theorem 5.3 in <ref> [14] </ref> and the equivalence of FJQN-Bs and B-FJQN/Bs. Theorem III.2: Let M 1 and M 2 be two initial markings of a FJQN/B S. Under Assumptions A1 and A2, if M 1 ~ M 2 , we have: (M 1 ) = (M 2 ): B. <p> The following result establishes the concavity of the throughput of a FJQN/B with respect to both the buffer capacities and the initial marking. It is a consequence of Theorem 8.1 in <ref> [14] </ref> and the equivalence of FJQN-Bs and B-FJQN/Bs. Theorem III.4: Let S = (V; E; B; M ; T ) be a FJQN/B. Then, under Assumption A4, (S) is a concave function of B and M . <p> It is easy to check from the transformations described in Section II-C that the equivalent B-FJQN/B of S r is the reverse of the equivalent B-FJQN/B of S. The proof then follows from Theorem 6.2 in <ref> [14] </ref>. Special cases of the above result were previously obtained by Yamazaki and Sakasegawa [34] and Muth [26] in the case of tandem queueing networks and by Liu [24] in the case of closed tandem queueing networks. <p> If S and S r have the same (joint distribution of the) sequences of service times, then under Assumptions A1 and A3, we have: (S r ) = (S): (4) Proof. The proof follows simply from Lemma III.1 and Theorem 6.2 in <ref> [14] </ref>. E. Symmetry Properties In this section, we investigate whether or not a symmetry property similar to that of B-FJQN/Bs can be established for FJQN/Bs. We first establish the following result pertaining to FJQN/Bs with BBS servers. <p> Then, under Assumptions A1 and A3, we have: (S s ) = (S) (5) Proof. The proof simply follows by applying Theorem 7.2 in <ref> [14] </ref> to the equivalent B-FJQN/Bs of S and S s . The following corollary follows from Theorems III.11 and III.2. Corollary III.1: Consider a FJQN/B S = (V; E; B; M ; T ) in which all servers are BBS servers (either BBS/IL or BBS/SL servers) with empty initial loadings. <p> Let S b be the B-FJQN/B equivalent to S. Its initial marking is such that: M b l i ;i = M b M b l i ;u i = 0. Theorem 7.2 in <ref> [14] </ref> can be applied to S b . Let M s denote the symmetrical marking of M b , i.e., M s = B b M b , and let S s denote the resulting B-FJQN/B. <p> The B-FJQN/B equivalent to the assembly system and that equivalent to the serial line both have buffer capacities B 1;3 + 2 and B 2;3 + 2. Therefore, according to the duality property established in <ref> [14] </ref>, these two models are equivalent and the proof follows.

Reference-contexts: This is done by showing the B-FJQN/B obtained after transformation of the FJQN/B in Figure 4. For the case of a BAS/IL/IU server, we also provide a mathematical description of the transformation. Similar mathematical descriptions for the other cases are given in <ref> [15] </ref>. In each case it is easy to check that the FJQN/B S 0 obtained from S by transforming server i exhibits the same behavior as the original FJQN/B S. A formal statement of equivalence and its proof can be found in [15]. <p> descriptions for the other cases are given in <ref> [15] </ref>.

Overall transformation. <p> Monotonicity and Concavity The following result establishes the monotonicity of the throughput of a FJQN/B with respect to the buffer capacities. It is a consequence of corollaries 2.1 and 2.2 in <ref> [15] </ref> and the equivalence of FJQN-Bs and B-FJQN/Bs. Theorem III.3: Consider a FJQN/B S with two different buffer capacity vectors and initial marking vectors (B; M ) and (B + k; M + j). <p> As a result, we have (S m ) = (S 2b ). Now, S 1b is a subnetwork of S m and thus, from Corollary 2.3 in <ref> [15] </ref>, we get (S 1b ) (S m ). As a result, we have (S 1b ) (S 2b ) and, thus, (BAS=IL=SU ) (BAS=SL=SU ). This theorem states that an independent loading (resp. unloading) policy achieves a higher throughput than a simultaneous loading (resp. unloading) policy. <p> Theorem III.8: Consider a FJQN/B S in which server i may operate under different operating mechanisms. Then, under Assumption A1, we have: (BBS=IL; B) (BAS=IL=SU; B) (BAS=IL=IU; B) (BBS=IL; B i+ ); (BBS=SL; B) (BAS=SL=SU; B) (BAS=SL=IU; B) (BBS=SL; B i+ ): Proof. The proof can be found in <ref> [15] </ref>. The above result implies that the throughput of a FJQN/B with BAS servers and buffer capacity vector B can be bounded from below and from above by the throughputs of two FJQN/Bs with BBS servers and buffer capacity vectors B and B + 1, respectively. <p> A detailed discussion of these extensions can be found in <ref> [15] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: As is usually the case with discrete event systems, most analytical techniques for performance evaluation rely on Markov chain analysis. In order to use Markov chain analysis, service time distributions must be represented by exponential distributions or mixtures of exponential distributions such as phase-type (PH) distributions <ref> [27] </ref>. Unfortunately, FJQN/Bs do not have close-form solutions, even under the assumption of exponentially distributed service times. For small or moderate size systems, the performance parameters can be derived by numerically solving the underlying Markov chain.

Special cases of some of the results presented here were obtained in earlier papers [1], [3], [6], [24], [25], [26], <ref> [28] </ref>, [32], [35].

This equivalence between BAS and BBS-CL mechanisms was first reported by Onvural and Perros <ref> [28] </ref> for the special case of tandem queueing networks. The following result compares the loading and unloading policies of a server with a BAS blocking mechanism. Theorem III.6: Let S = (V; E; B; M ; T ) be a FJQN/B.

Most of these results pertain to tandem and closed tandem queueing networks. <p> Then, under Assumption A1, we have: (B + k; M + k) (B; M ); 8k j 0: Special cases of the above result were previously obtained by Shanthikumar and Yao <ref> [32] </ref> in the case of a closed tandem queueing network and by Adan and Van Der Waal [1] in the case of an assembly network. The following result establishes the concavity of the throughput of a FJQN/B with respect to both the buffer capacities and the initial marking. <p> Then, under Assumption A4, (S) is a concave function of B and M .

C. Comparison of Various Operating Mechanisms Consider a particular B-server, say i, of a FJQN/B S. We are interested in comparing the behavior of S under different operating mechanisms of server i.

Reference-contexts: The following property then follows from the results derived in Section III-D. Theorem IV.5: The production capacity of a kanban controlled production line is the same as that of the reverse kanban controlled production line. The above results (monotonicity and reversibility) were derived in [10], [11], [21], <ref> [33] </ref> in the special case where each stage consists of a single machine. Our results show that they hold regardless of the number of machines in each stage.
