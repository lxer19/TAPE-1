Abstract: This paper discusses the feasibility of using configuration space (C-space) as a means of visualization and control in operator-guided real-time motion of a robot arm manipulator. The motivation is to improve performance of the human operator in tasks involving the manipulator motion in an environment with obstacles. Unlike some other motion planning tasks, operators are known to make expensive mistakes in such tasks, even in a simpler two-dimensional case. They have difficulty learning better procedures and their performance improves very little with practice. Using an example of a two-dimensional arm manipulator, we show that translating the problem into C-space improves the operator performance rather remarkably, on the order of magnitude compared to the usual work space control. An interface that makes the transfer possible is described, and an example of its use in a virtual environment is shown.

Reference-contexts: Experiments with human subjects <ref> [4, 5] </ref> suggest that the problem is in the peculiarities of human spatial reasoning: humans have difficulty handling simultaneous interaction with objects at multiple points of the device's body, or motion that involves mechanical joints (such as in arm manipulators), or dynamic tasks. <p> Success in this area will also mean applicability of the approach to a dynamic environment with moving obstacles. Computer algorithms for motion planning with incomplete information are available (e.g. [6]). Experiments with human subjects operating in an unknown maze <ref> [4, 5] </ref> suggest that humans might be able to handle this case as well. The immediate problem is to determine if the resulting three dimensional C-space will still be as helpful to the human in performing the task as the two dimensional case was.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, these experiments confirm the expected fact that in a maze-searching problem, if information is provided about the whole maze (a bird's-eye view), human performance is well above the fastest computer with the best known algorithms <ref> [6] </ref>. Figure 1 gives an example of human performance in a maze: after inspecting the maze for a few seconds, the subjects grasp the problem and produce an almost optimal path from point S to point T. <p> A geodesic line between two points on the torus (a straight line in the plane ( 1 , 2 )) is the "shortest path" between the points: four such paths can actually appear <ref> [6] </ref>. 3.1 Motion Control in C-space We will now attempt to control the arm motion indirectly, via its point image in C-space (C-point). <p> A finite number of obstacles in W-space produce a finite set of virtual obstacles in C-space. The boundaries of virtual obstacles are known to consist of simple closed curves <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> Note that two or more W-space obstacles can produce a single virtual obstacle; that is, for the purposes of motion control, they would indeed be one obstacle. Our simulation uses an efficient variation of this procedure [7], which makes use of the Bug1 <ref> [6] </ref> algorithm. In brief, procedure Bug1 operates as follows: the point robot starts moving along the straight line towards target point T. <p> Success in this area will also mean applicability of the approach to a dynamic environment with moving obstacles. Computer algorithms for motion planning with incomplete information are available (e.g. <ref> [6] </ref>). Experiments with human subjects operating in an unknown maze [4, 5] suggest that humans might be able to handle this case as well.

Reference-contexts: We exploit the fact that for today's computer algorithms, which are based on spatial geometry and topology tools, both tasks present essentially the same maze-searching problem <ref> [7] </ref>. By transforming the problem to the arm configuration space (C-space), the arm is shrunk to a point in the space of its control variables. Below, the properties of work space control are discussed in Section 2, and those of the configuration space in Section 3. <p> The task is to move the arm from a position S (Start) to the position T (Target), Figure 3. 3 2.1 Motion Control in W-space Arm motion is controlled with the computer mouse, in two separate modes joint-mode and tip-mode <ref> [7] </ref>. The former allows control of individual joints by positioning the pointer closer to one of the joints and pressing the left mouse button, which causes the selected joint to move and align with the pointer. <p> The boundaries of virtual obstacles are known to consist of simple closed curves [6]. Since virtual obstacles are defined in terms of arm variables ( 1 , 2 ), their shape is visually unrelated to the shape of the W-space obstacles <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. 3.2 Construction of C-space Obstacles The greatest improvement in the operator performance comes when full information (the bird's-eye view) about C-space is available (on the issue of operating with uncertainty, see the discussion in Section 5.2). We thus need to compute and display all the virtual obstacles. <p> Note that two or more W-space obstacles can produce a single virtual obstacle; that is, for the purposes of motion control, they would indeed be one obstacle. Our simulation uses an efficient variation of this procedure <ref> [7] </ref>, which makes use of the Bug1 [6] algorithm. In brief, procedure Bug1 operates as follows: the point robot starts moving along the straight line towards target point T.

An intuitive approach proposed in <ref> [8] </ref> is to treat each link separately. First, link l2 is ignored, and all free space points for the whole range of values 1 are computed. Points of the arm contact with physical (W-space) obstacles are recorded and become part of the corresponding virtual obstacle.
