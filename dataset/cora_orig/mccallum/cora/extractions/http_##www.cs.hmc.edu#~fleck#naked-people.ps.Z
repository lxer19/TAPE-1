Abstract: This paper demonstrates a content-based retrieval strategy that can tell whether there are naked people present in an image. No manual intervention is required. The approach combines color and texture properties to obtain an effective mask for skin regions. The skin mask is shown to be effective for a wide range of shades and colors of skin. These skin regions are then fed to a specialized grouper, which attempts to group a human figure using geometric constraints on human structure. This approach introduces a new view of object recognition, where an object model is an organized collection of grouping hints obtained from a combination of constraints on geometric properties such as the structure of individual parts, and the relationships between parts, and constraints on color and texture. The system is demonstrated to have 60% precision and 52% recall on a test set of 138 uncontrolled images of naked people, mostly obtained from the internet, and 1401 assorted control images, drawn from a wide collection of sources. Keywords: Content-based Retrieval, Object Recognition, Computer Vision, Erotica/Pornography, Internet, Color

Reference-contexts: Sheffield's version of Canny's [3] edge detector, with relatively high smoothing and contrast thresholds, is applied to these skin areas to obtain a set of connected edge curves. Pairs of edge points with a near-parallel local symmetry <ref> [1] </ref> are found by a straightforward algorithm. Sets of points forming regions with roughly straight axes ("ribbons" [2]) are found using an algorithm based on the Hough transformation.

Reference-contexts: Pairs of edge points with a near-parallel local symmetry [1] are found by a straightforward algorithm. Sets of points forming regions with roughly straight axes ("ribbons" <ref> [2] </ref>) are found using an algorithm based on the Hough transformation. Grouping proceeds by first identifying potential segment outlines, where a segment outline is a ribbon with a straight axis and relatively small variation in average width. <p> The reason we have achieved such good performance, and expect even better performance in the future, is that we use object models quite different from those commonly used in computer vision (though similar to proposals in <ref> [2, 14] </ref>). In the new system, an object is modelled as a loosely coordinated collection of detection and grouping rules. The object is recognized if a suitable group can be built. These grouping rules incorporate both surface properties (color and texture) and simple shape information.

Reference-contexts: The input to the geometric grouping algorithm is a set of images, in which the skin filter has marked areas identified as human skin. Sheffield's version of Canny's <ref> [3] </ref> edge detector, with relatively high smoothing and contrast thresholds, is applied to these skin areas to obtain a set of connected edge curves.

Reference-contexts: There is little previous work on finding people in static images, though [9] shows that a stick-figure group can yield pose in 3D up to limited ambiguities; the work on motion sequences is well summarised in <ref> [4] </ref>. Several systems have recently been developed for retrieving images from large databases. The best-known such system is QBIC [15], which allows an operator to specify various properties of a desired image.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, the region marked as skin is enlarged to include pixels many of whose neighbors passed the initial filter. If the marked regions cover at least 30% 3 All operations use a fast multi-ring approximation to the median filter <ref> [5] </ref>. of the image area, the image will be referred for geometric processing.

Reference-contexts: However, the approach does not adequately address the range of variation in object shape and appears to require manually segmented images for all but trivial cases. Appearance based matching is also used in <ref> [8] </ref>, which describes a system that forms a wavelet based decomposition of an image and matches based on the coarse-scale appearance. Similarly, Chabot [16] uses a combination of visual appearance and text-based cues to retrieve images, but depends strongly on text cues to identify objects.

Reference-contexts: These hypotheses are combined as appropriate, and the result is back-projected into the image, and verified by inspecting relationships between the back-projected outline and image edges. An extensive bibliography of this approach appears in <ref> [12] </ref>. Systems that recognize an object by matching a view to a collection of images of an object proceed in one of two ways.

Reference-contexts: An alternative approach computes a feature vector from a compressed version of the image and uses a minimum distance classifier to match this feature vector to feature vectors computed from images of objects in a range of positions under various lighting conditions <ref> [13] </ref>. Neither class of system copes well with models that have large numbers of internal degrees of freedom, nor do they incorporate appropriate theories of parts.

Reference-contexts: The system then displays a selection of potential matches to those criteria, sorted by a score of the appropriateness of the match. Searches employ an underlying abstraction of an image as a collection of colored, textured regions, which were manually segmented in advance, a significant disadvantage. Photobook <ref> [17] </ref> largely shares QBIC's model of an image as a collage of flat, homogenous frontally presented regions, but incor-porates more sophisticated representations of texture and a degree of automatic segmentation. A version of Photobook ([17], p. 10) incorporates a simple notion of objects, using plane matching by an energy minimisation strategy.

Reference-contexts: Images containing sufficiently large skin-colored groups of possible limbs are reported as potentially containing naked people. 2.1 Finding Skin The appearance of skin is tightly constrained. The color of a human's skin is created by a combination of blood (red) and melanin (yellow, brown) <ref> [18] </ref>. Therefore, human skin has a restricted range of hues. Skin is somewhat saturated, but not deeply saturated. Because more deeply colored skin is created by adding melanin, the range of possible hues shifts toward yellow as saturation increases. Finally, skin has little texture; extremely hairy subjects are rare.

Reference-contexts: These images frequently lack textual labels adequate to identify their content but can be effectively detected using simple visual cues (color, texture, simple shape features), of the type that the human visual system is known to use for fast (preattentive) triage <ref> [19] </ref>. There is little previous work on finding people in static images, though [9] shows that a stick-figure group can yield pose in 3D up to limited ambiguities; the work on motion sequences is well summarised in [4].
