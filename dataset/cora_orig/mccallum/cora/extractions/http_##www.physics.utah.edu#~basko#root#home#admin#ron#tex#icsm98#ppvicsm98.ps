Abstract: We have applied a multitude of continuous wave and pulsed optical spectroscopies to thin films of unsubstituted poly(para-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) with photoluminescence quantum effciency 60%. Laser action in thin films, microdisks and microrings has been demonstrated. The threshold for lasing is comparable to other PPV derivatives. Electroabsorption unambiguosly shows that the mA g state is located at 3.4 eV. At higher photon energies no large polarizability of excited states could be found. The photoinduced absorption spectrum whoich contains both polarons and triplet excitation is very weak, showing a relatively defect free polymer.

Under these conditions it has been shown [7] that the PM signal is independent of the photoexcitation lifetime, and hence, properties of the generation process may be studied. 2. <p> One way of overcoming this obstacle is to measure far from StS conditions, which means f t 1, where f is the chopper frequency and t is the the photoexcited species lifetime, or at low light intensities <ref> [7] </ref>.

Experimental The PPV polymer was synthesized by the commonly used precursor route <ref> [8] </ref>, where a nonconjugated soluble polymer is cast into films, and then converted to the desired polymer by heating in an inert atmosphere. Thin casted films were converted to the PPV polymer by heating in flowing nitrogen at 220 ffi C for at least two hours.

Reference-contexts: The excitation light was focused in a plane perpendicular to the fiber axis so that only the - ring was excited. The resolution of the spectrometer was better than 1 A. The PM spectroscopy has been implemented in the usual configuration <ref> [11] </ref>. The PPV film was excited with the ultra-violet lines from an Ar + -laser and we probe the optical range of 0:1 2:5 eV. We measure the changes T in the sample transmission T caused by the excitation beam and then normalized to get the T =T spectrum. <p> Two PA bands dominate the spectrum; one at high energy (HE), centered at around 1.5 eV, and the other at low energy (LE) centered at 0.6 eV. The LE band consists of the P 1-transition of photogenerated polarons <ref> [11] </ref>, whereas the HE band is a mixture of the polaron P 2-transition and triplet PA [12, 14]. Triplet PA, however, dominates the PA band at 1.4 eV, since PA detected magnetic resonance measurements show a clear spin 1 signal at 1.4 eV [19].

Results and Discussion 3.1 Laser Action The well-known absorption and photolumines-cence (PL) of a PPV thin film is shown in Fig. 1 <ref> [12] </ref>. The absorption shows an onset at about 2.5 eV, and con-sists of several vibronic sidebands. The long absorption tail below the optical gap, has ususally been attributed to uncorrected reflections and scattering in the film [13, 14]. <p> Fig. 5. PA spectrum in PPV films at 90 K. The LE and HE bands have been assigned. The dashed line denotes the triplet part of the HE band. Note the low PA magnitude. 3.3 Photoinduced absorption Photoinduced absorption (PA) has been extensively studied in PPV <ref> [12, 14] </ref>. In Fig. 5 we show a typical PA spectrum of a PPV film on sapphire. Two PA bands dominate the spectrum; one at high energy (HE), centered at around 1.5 eV, and the other at low energy (LE) centered at 0.6 eV. <p> The LE band consists of the P 1-transition of photogenerated polarons [11], whereas the HE band is a mixture of the polaron P 2-transition and triplet PA <ref> [12, 14] </ref>.

We measured the tail absorption using a photothermal deflection (PDS) technique (see inset in Fig 1), and it shows that PPV has a remarkable long band tail, extending down to below 1.0 eV. <p> Two photon fluorescence spectroscopy, on the other hand, showed two clear bands, one at 2! ' 3eV , and the other at 2! ' 3:4eV . The important even parity exciton (mA g ) was therefore mistakenly assigned at 3.0 eV <ref> [13] </ref>. We know from PDS (see the inset in Fig. 1) that PPV has a very long absorption tail towards low energies.

The spectral narrowing observed in these films arises at 547 nm (2.26 eV), at the 0-1 PL transition (see Fig. 2). The output emission intensity vs excitation intensity is shown in the inset of Fig. 2, and the threshold for laser action is around 0:2J/pulse.

The inter-mode spacing of this mode is given by = Dn eff and as can be seen in Fig. 3 the experimentally observed inter-mode spacing ( = 0:45nm) follows this relation with n eff = 1:58. Fig. 3.

Reference-contexts: In EA we use an electric field to modify the electronic states in the material, and consequently the changes in absorption by the electric field can be measured. To a good approximation the measured EA spectrum is proportional to the imaginary part of the third-order optical susceptibility <ref> [17] </ref> T =T = ffd = nc where ff is the changes in the absorption coefficient, ! is the photon frequency, n is the refractive index, c is the speed of light, and F is the applied electric field. Fig. 4. <p> Fig. 4. Electroabsorption spectrum of a PPV film compared with the first derivative of the absorption spectrum. The EA spectrum of PPV is shown in Fig. 4. The EA at the onset is caused by an energy red shift, as expected for the excitonic Stark shift in polymers <ref> [17] </ref>. This Stark shift leads to a derivative-like feature, and from the zero crossing we conclude that the average 1B u exciton in our PPV sample lies at about 2.6 eV. <p> There is another spectral feature at about 3.4 eV, not described by the @(OD)=@E spectrum, attributed to the mA g state <ref> [17] </ref>. It is also seen that the magnitude of the EA signal decreases with increasing photon energy, and hence, the state polarizability, which is proportional to the EA signal [17] is small at higher energies. <p> There is another spectral feature at about 3.4 eV, not described by the @(OD)=@E spectrum, attributed to the mA g state <ref> [17] </ref>. It is also seen that the magnitude of the EA signal decreases with increasing photon energy, and hence, the state polarizability, which is proportional to the EA signal [17] is small at higher energies. This contradicts the proposed model for the photogeneration of charge carriers in polymeric semiconductors, where the absorption feature at 5eV is supposed to be due to a highly delocalized state, responsible for the photocurrent [5].

Reference-contexts: Triplet PA, however, dominates the PA band at 1.4 eV, since PA detected magnetic resonance measurements show a clear spin 1 signal at 1.4 eV <ref> [19] </ref>. Also the frequency and temperature dependence are not similar when measured at 1.4eV (triplets) and 0.6 eV (polarons), see Figs. 6 and 7 respectively. One way of measuring the quality of the film is the amount of long-lived photogenerated species.
