Reference-contexts: Our most recent work in agent control, namely Design-to-Criteria [11, 9] scheduling and GPGP <ref> [2, 6] </ref> multi-agent coordination is directed at addressing such agent control issues. We believe that the key to operating in these open envi fl This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. <p> We model these problem solving activities using the TMS <ref> [2] </ref> domain-independent hierarchical task modeling framework. In TMS, primitive actions, called methods, are modeled statistically via discrete probability distributions in three dimensions, quality, cost, and duration. Quality is a deliberately abstract domain-independent concept that describes the contribution of a particular action to the overall problem solving objective. <p> TMS models are the grounding element and medium of exchange for Design-to-Criteria [9, 10] and Design-to-Time [4] scheduling, and and multi-agent <ref> [2] </ref> coordination research, and are being used in Cooperative-Information-Gathering [5], collaborative distributed design [3], distributed situation assessment [1], and surviveable systems [8] research projects. A simplified example of a TMS task structure for gathering auto purchase information via the Web is shown in are methods. <p> Commitments are made through the coordination mechanisms and considered by the scheduler when the local course of action is decided. GPGP defines the following coordination mechanisms (for the for mal details see <ref> [2] </ref>): Share Non-Local Views This most basic coordination mechanism handles the exchange of local views between agents and the detection of task interactions. <p> GPGP achieves flexibility through a modularized approach to coordination. The question then becomes which combinations of mechanisms are most effective. Empirical analysis <ref> [2] </ref> has shown that no single coordination mechanism, or sets of mechanisms, is most effective for all situations.

Empirical analysis [2] has shown that no single coordination mechanism, or sets of mechanisms, is most effective for all situations. Instead, as shown in Prassad and Lesser <ref> [6] </ref>, coordination is best viewed as a situation specific activity; which set of mechanisms is most effective is dependent on the types of tasks in question and the overhead costs of communications.

Reference-contexts: The benefits of spending time doing further coordination or more refined scheduling versus time spent problem solving must all be compared and reasoned about. This meta analysis <ref> [7] </ref> approach to agent control in conjunction with the satisficing abilities of Design-to-Criteria and GPGP, will result in agents being able to satisfice all activities and adapt to a wide range of dynamic problem solving environments. However, this is an oversimplification of the problem.

Reference-contexts: To make matters even more difficult the planning and scheduling tasks are generally non-trivial, requiring either exponential work or, in practice, a sophisticated solution scheme that controls the algorithmic complexity and makes agent control a tractable problem. Our most recent work in agent control, namely Design-to-Criteria <ref> [11, 9] </ref> scheduling and GPGP [2, 6] multi-agent coordination is directed at addressing such agent control issues.

For example, portions of the client goal specification <ref> [9] </ref> express soft client objectives or soft constraints. Solutions often do not need to meet absolute requirements because clients cannot know a priori what types of solutions are possible for a given task structure due to the combinatorics. <p> The previous example is cast in terms of time allocations, but as mentioned earlier, satisficing can be in many dimensions like precision, robustness, and cost, and it can be in terms of multiple dimensions simultaneously. This is what motivated our recent work in multi-dimensional goal criteria for Design-to-Criteria scheduling <ref> [9] </ref>. But even that work 5 needs to be pushed to another level satisficing to meet a particular set of multi-dimensional goal criteria is only part of the problem. In most problem solving situations, there are actually multiple sets of goal criteria, i.e., there is no single evaluation function.

Reference-contexts: One view of this idea, that also appears in our work, is the notion of resource-bounded-reasoning, i.e., solving a problem in different amounts of time or with different allotments of computational resources, perhaps trading-off solution quality and resource consumption. This is classically illustrated by an anytime <ref> [12] </ref> curve and typically translates into parameterizing the size of the solution space that is searched during problem solving (or the level of abstraction at which problem solving occurs). However, this view is only part of the picture.
