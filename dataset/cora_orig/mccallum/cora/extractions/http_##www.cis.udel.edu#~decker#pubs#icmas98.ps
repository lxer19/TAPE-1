Title: Coordinated Hospital Patient Scheduling

Abstract: Hospital Patient Scheduling is an inherently distributed problem because of the way real hospitals are organized. As medical procedures have become more complex, and their associated tests and treatments have become interrelated, the current ad hoc patient scheduling solutions have been observed to break down [15]. We propose a multi-agent solution using the Generalized Partial Global Planning (GPGP) approach that preserves the existing human organization and authority structures, while providing better system-level performance (increased hospital unit throughput and decreased patient stay time). To do this, we extend GPGP with a new coordination mechanism to handle mutually exclusive resource relationships. Like the other GPGP mechanisms, the new mechanism can be applied to any problem with the appropriate resource relationship. We evaluate the this new mechanism in the context of the hospital patient scheduling problem, and examine the effect of increasing interrelations between tasks performed by different hospital units.

Reference-contexts: Since different agents may have different goals with respect to each other and with any global goals, the performance of such a system can be worse than that of a centralized system. In many domains such as hospital scheduling (or telescope observation scheduling <ref> [1] </ref>), We cannot central-ize scheduling because it would take away the authority of each unit over the day-to-day control of its own activities. Our distributed approach matches with the existing human organizational structure.

Reference-contexts: The GPGP approach uses a set of individual coordination mechanisms to help to construct these partial views, and to recognize and respond to particular task structure relationships by making commitments to other agents. These commitments result in more coherent, coordinated behavior <ref> [3, 2, 11] </ref>. No one coordination algorithm will be appropriate for all task environments, but by selecting from a set of possible coordination mechanisms we can create a wide set of different coordination responses.

Reference-contexts: We are aware of the utility of more complex multi-stage negotiations (e.g. <ref> [4] </ref>), and intend to examine the utility of such higher-overhead, higher-payoff approaches. The new mechanism we have developed can now be applied to any environment with resource constraints. Finally, we demonstrated the effect of the new coorination mechanism on performance in different environments.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Generalized Partial Global Planning (GPGP) is a task environment centered approach to coordination <ref> [8, 5] </ref>. The basic idea is that each agent constructs its own local view of the structure and relationships of its intended tasks. This view may then be augmented by information from other agents, and it may change in other ways dynamically over time. <p> Our experience is that in highly dynamic environments with large amounts of uncertainty, excessive time taken to find an optimal or near-optimal schedule is wasted <ref> [5] </ref>. Other assumptions that we make include that the agents are essentially cooperating with one another, and that their utility measures are comparable (here, we are usually dealing with the amount of time saved, which is a comparable measure). <p> One of the features of TMS is the indication of these utility-affecting changes in a precise, quantitative manner. However, since a peculiarity of this problem is that all tests must be done, reasoning about cost and benefit tradeoffs is not discussed here (but see <ref> [5] </ref>). 5. Experimental results Since final quality is not so important in the hospital scheduling problem (tasks are either done or not done), we use the average task finish time and the actual work done by all agents to measure the performance of each agent.

Reference-contexts: We have demonstrated the usefulness of the GPGP approach using five coordination mechanisms drawn from Durfee's original PGP work [9] in several domains distributed vehicle monitoring <ref> [6] </ref>, distributed data processing [16], and in randomly generated problems [8]. This paper contains a study of GPGP as applied to the hospital patient scheduling domain. The domain is quite interesting because it is inherently distributed due to the existing human authority structure of a hospital.

Reference-contexts: To address this new relationship, first we must define it formally as a resource constraint in our task structure representation language (TMS <ref> [7, 18] </ref>) and then we define a new GPGP coordination mechanism to handle the new task relationship. We show how the existing practices can be captured using GPGP and removing some of the mechanisms. <p> Furthermore, each test may interact with other tests in relationships such as enables, requiresdelay (a slight variation on enables), and inhibits (a negative variation of the soft facilitates relationship). These task relationships indicate when the execution of one task changes the characteristics (here, primarily duration) of another task <ref> [7] </ref>. From this view of task structure, the hospital scheduling problem has these peculiar features: * Tasks have no redundancy. Each test can only be done by a single ancillary department. * The quality accumulation functions of non-executable tasks are always min. <p> Generalized Partial Global Planning (GPGP) GPGP is a domain independent scheduling coordination approach 1 The GPGP approach makes several architectural assumptions. Most important of these is that the agent represents its current set of intended tasks using the TMS task structure representation language <ref> [7] </ref>. These task structures are abstraction hierarchies whose leaves are instantiated basic actions or executable methods. TMS allows the specification of dynamically changing and uncertain task characteristics that effect an agent's preferences for some state of the world, including tasks with hard or soft deadlines.

Reference-contexts: Ow's mechanism also does not explicitly handle interactions between tests at different ancillaries. The set of GPGP coordination mechanisms described here easily respond to these inter-ancillary interactions as well as eliminate the full broadcast communication. A great deal of interesting work has also been done on multi-agent meeting scheduling <ref> [17, 10] </ref>. This work has focussed on coordinating the resources and typically has not dealt with multiple hard and soft task interrelationships. 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we presented a model of the Hospital Scheduling Problem in TMS, and applied the GPGP approach to solving this problem.

Reference-contexts: Therefore we describe a new resource-constraint coordination mechanism. The new mechanism uses a simple multi-round but not multistage negotiation process which is not optimal but has good flow properties since at least one agent is free to stop meta-level communication and begin domain work at each round <ref> [12] </ref>. Our experience is that in highly dynamic environments with large amounts of uncertainty, excessive time taken to find an optimal or near-optimal schedule is wasted [5].

Reference-contexts: The job agents are similar to the agents in this paper, responsible for finishing their own jobs. They later extend the CP&CR to a new coordination mechanism Anchor&Ascend to deal with the Constraint Optimization Problem <ref> [14] </ref>. This mechanism also assigns resources to a resource agent. It identifies a bottleneck resource, and identifies the agent that is responsible for this resource as chance of standard inter-ancillary relationships) (all inter-ancillary relationships are always present) the Anchor agent.

Reference-contexts: First we discuss the hospital patient scheduling problem. Next we briefly discuss GPGP, and focus on the new resource constraint coordination mechanism. Finally, we present our experimental results. 2. The Hospital Scheduling Problem Our model is drawn from a case study of an actual hospital <ref> [15] </ref>: scheduling episode. Patients in General Hospital reside in units that are organized by branches of medicine, such as orthopedics or neurosurgery. <p> When dealing with hospital scheduling problem, the disadvantage of that style of solution is that it lets an agent outside of an ancillary to directly affect the ancillary's local schedule. Ow, Prietula, and Hsu also develop a organization structure for hospital scheduling problem <ref> [15] </ref>. Their organization contains unit agents which are responsible for monitoring the test schedule of each patient as well as collecting and disseminating test requests to the ancillary systems, and the ancillary agent which is responsible for collecting the test requests sent to it and schedules them.
