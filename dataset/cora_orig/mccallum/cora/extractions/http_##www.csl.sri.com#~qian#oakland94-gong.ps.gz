Title: The Complexity and Composability of Secure Interoperation

Abstract: Advances in distributed systems and networking technology have made interoperation not only feasible but also increasingly popular. We define the interop-eration of secure systems and its security, and prove complexity and composability results on obtaining optimal and secure interoperation. Most problems are NP-complete even for systems with very simple access control structures. Nevertheless, composability reduces complexity in that secure global interoperation can be obtained incrementally by composing secure local in-teroperation. We illustrate, through an application, how these theoretical results can help system designers in practice.

Reference-contexts: For future work, one direction is to improve the theoretical results. This includes obtaining results on the hardness of obtaining percentage-wise approximation solutions, where some recent work <ref> [ALM + 92] </ref> may be helpful, and investigating other optimality measurements that are applicable to particular environments. We have so far assumed that R represents direct access that are undesirable, such as a negative entry in an access control list.

Reference-contexts: First we turn to what we think are the fundamental requirements in secure interoper-ation. 2 Principles of Secure Interoperation One essential feature in federated systems is the autonomy of an individual system each system may be administrated independently <ref> [BGS92, SL90] </ref>. To preserve this feature in secure interoperation, autonomy in security must be guaranteed. Principle of Autonomy. Any access permitted within an individual system must also be permitted under secure interoperation. On the other hand, interoperation should not vio late the security of an individual system. Principle of Security.

Reference-contexts: For example, given two permitted access that together will violate security, instead of deciding somewhat arbitrarily to remove one, we can decide to keep the one that is first used during run time. This is similar to the Chinese Wall policy (e.g., <ref> [BN89] </ref>) where one access will automatically prohibit future access of another kind, but which access to prohibit is not decided in advance. Acknowledgment Our colleagues at SRI, Pat Lincoln, Teresa Lunt, and Peter Neumann provided valuable comments on drafts of this paper.

Reference-contexts: The problem belongs to NP because a nondeterministic machine can guess a solution at random and verify its autonomy and security properties in polynomial time (refer to Theorem 1 on security evaluation). The rest of the proof is to reduce a known NP-complete problem, the Feedback Arc Set problem <ref> [GJ79, p.192] </ref>, to a restricted case of our problem at hand. We first review the Feedback Arc Set problem: Given a directed graph G =&lt; V; A &gt;, positive integer K j A j. <p> Proof. The subproblem when all A i ; i = 1; : : :; n, and R are empty sets is identical to the known NP-complete problem, Minimum Equivalent Digraph <ref> [GJ79, p.198] </ref>. 2 This result implies that, unless P=NP, any polynomial-time algorithm for finding a secure inter-operation cannot guarantee to result in a minimum representation Nevertheless, if we remove the constraint that reduction can take place only within F that is, we ask if there is a F 0 [ n <p> F that is, we ask if there is a F 0 [ n i=1;j=1;i6=j V i fi V j such that j F 0 j K and that the set of legal access remains unchanged when F is replaced by F 0 then the problem is equivalent to Transitive Reduction <ref> [GJ79, p.198] </ref>, which is solvable in polynomial time. This type of reduction may be useful in a preprocessing step to reduce the problem space of any algorithm used subsequently.

Reference-contexts: In addition, given the particular restrictions on ACL, our results should also imply NP-completeness results for the interoperation of Bell-LaPadula (e.g., [Lan81]) type multilevel secure systems, although our study is not specially aimed at multilevel security either in the sense of Bell-LaPadula or that of noninterference (e.g., <ref> [GM82] </ref>). In our discussion, we use the following terminology, notations, and definitions. Because one subject owns exactly one file, there is no need to distinguish between a subject and its file.

Reference-contexts: We deal with secure interoperation of systems with heterogeneous security attributes, and the composition method we examine is a very natural one that has been used frequently in practice. Another related work is a study of interopera-tion of multilevel secure databases <ref> [JW94] </ref>, where the problem is security label translation. Like us, these researchers recognize that naive interoperation may cause security violations. They define a notion called relation consistency and propose a label insertion algorithm to achieve that.

Reference-contexts: It is conceivable that under some circumstances a system may be willing to sacrifice some of its autonomy. 3 System Model and Terminology In our discussion, the security attributes of a system are expressed with an access control list (ACL) <ref> [Lam71] </ref>. We view a system as a collection of users, machines, data objects, and others, each being a distinct unit with regard to security.

Reference-contexts: Our NP-completeness results should imply similar NP-completeness results for formations of the problem using more general access control lists. In addition, given the particular restrictions on ACL, our results should also imply NP-completeness results for the interoperation of Bell-LaPadula (e.g., <ref> [Lan81] </ref>) type multilevel secure systems, although our study is not specially aimed at multilevel security either in the sense of Bell-LaPadula or that of noninterference (e.g., [GM82]).

Reference-contexts: A number of composition methods have been proposed for building a large system out of secure components (e.g., <ref> [McC90] </ref>). These previous results are mostly focused on composing systems with identical or compatible security attributes or policies, and tend to fall in the category of multilevel security where the avoidance of covert channels is of paramount importance.

Reference-contexts: As more secure databases are built and connected through computer networks, a wide variety of secure data sources is becoming accessible. One of the biggest challenges presented by this technology is the secure interoperation of databases containing data with mismatched access control structures <ref> [Per92] </ref>. Providing secure interoperation not only makes it possible to reliably share data in isolated military and civilian databases, but also increases users' confidence and willingness in such sharing. A key requirement in the interoperation of heterogeneous and especially legacy databases is autonomy [SL90]. <p> Like us, these researchers recognize that naive interoperation may cause security violations. They define a notion called relation consistency and propose a label insertion algorithm to achieve that. But unlike us, they do not provide any complexity or composability result. In <ref> [Per92] </ref> a canonical security model was proposed for federated databases. The main concern was the integration of heterogeneous security policies and the specification of security constraints in a federated schema.

Reference-contexts: C A This is similar to a negative entry in an access control list <ref> [Sat89] </ref>. The purpose is to explicitly safeguard certain parts of the system when the potential implica tions of introducing F are unclear. In our example, we may forbid access (Diana; Eve). R takes precedence over F .

Reference-contexts: In such an application environment, heterogeneity (such as in data semantics, data representation, and communication protocol) among system components must be reconciled properly. Some research efforts are under way to deal with these problems <ref> [SL90] </ref>. One attribute of interoperation that needs reconciliation but has not been closely studied is security with regard to access control. Consider an application involving multiple systems dealing with commerce (e.g., national credit databases), finance (e.g., fl This work was supported in part by the U.S. <p> First we turn to what we think are the fundamental requirements in secure interoper-ation. 2 Principles of Secure Interoperation One essential feature in federated systems is the autonomy of an individual system each system may be administrated independently <ref> [BGS92, SL90] </ref>.

Any access permitted within an individual system must also be permitted under secure interoperation. On the other hand, interoperation should not vio late the security of an individual system. Principle of Security. <p> In some federated systems, for example, interoperation is accomplished by having a master system interacting with other systems in local interoperation <ref> [SL90] </ref>. We now prove that in such a configuration, the global interoperation is secure if and only if each local interoperation is secure. <p> Providing secure interoperation not only makes it possible to reliably share data in isolated military and civilian databases, but also increases users' confidence and willingness in such sharing. A key requirement in the interoperation of heterogeneous and especially legacy databases is autonomy <ref> [SL90] </ref>. Since these databases were often independently designed to each serve the needs of a single organization, and significant investment has already been made into them, the interoperation must respect their autonomy. Our definition of secure interopera-tion properly captures the autonomy requirement in security. <p> the most common case in multilevel military databases, where access control structures form total orders, is polynomial-time solvable, as is shown by Theorem 4. * Although solving the general problem involves examining globally all the interoperating databases and links between them, for the widely adopted case of federated database systems <ref> [SL90] </ref>, in which all data sharing is carried out through the federated schema, the problem can be solved in a pairwise manner, as is shown by Theorem 6. This implies that the problem can be solved incrementally as new databases join the federation.

Reference-contexts: To facilitate information exchange among such systems, some mapping between the heterogeneous security attributes must be introduced, for example, by the system administrators. Current practices show that these mappings, even if chosen carefully, can result in security breaches that previously did not exist in any individual system (e.g., <ref> [U.S87, U.S90] </ref>). Secure interoperation is a serious concern for military systems 1 as well as commercial ones. For example, consider the information system of a major research organization where Alice, being a project supervisor, is allowed access to Bob's files, but not vice versa.
