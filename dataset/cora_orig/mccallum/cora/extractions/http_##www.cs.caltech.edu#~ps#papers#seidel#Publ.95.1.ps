Abstract: Scattered data is, by definition, irregularly spaced. Uniform surface schemes are not well adapted to the locally varying nature of such data. Conversely, Triangular B-Spline surfaces [DMS92] are more flexible in that they can be built over arbitrary triangulations and thus can be adapted to the scattered data. This paper discusses the use of DMS spline surfaces for approximation of scattered data. A method is provided for automatically triangulating the domain containing the points and generating basis functions over this triangulation. A surface approximating the data is then found by a combination of least squares and bending energy minimization. This combination serves both to generate a smooth surface and to accommodate for gaps in the data. Examples are presented which demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique for mathematical, geographical and other data sets.

Reference-contexts: The knot clouds are chosen so as to avoid collinearity of knots associated with a particular triangle. The method used is similar to the one given in <ref> [AMNS91, page 81] </ref>. The selection of the knot clouds then defines the basis functions for the surface. Knots can also be selected to promote collinearity along certain edges of the triangulation.

Reference-contexts: fitting and fairing by minimizing a func tional In this section, we assume that a fixed set of basis functions exists, and that a surface F in the span of those functions should be used to approximate the data. 4.1 Least squares minimization We use the least squares method (see <ref> [HL89, Die93] </ref>) for approximating a set of functional scattered data. Given a surface F (x; y), the unweighted least squares functional LS (F ) = P l (F (x l ; y l ) z l ) 2 provides a measure of how well F approximates the data. <p> Standard solution techniques form either the observation equations or normal equations for a given data set <ref> [Die93] </ref>. Both kinds of systems can be solved using standard techniques. In order to form the individual entries of either of these matrices, each basis function (in our case, each DMS basis function N i;j;k ) must be evaluated at each (x l ; y l ) location.

Reference-contexts: This simple quadtree violates Property Three for data sets that contain tight clusters of points. Point clusters can cause finely-subdivided areas to be adjacent to far more coarsely subdivided areas, which, in turn, generates long thin triangles. This can be remedied by requiring that the quadtree be balanced <ref> [Sam90] </ref>. A quadtree is balanced if the depths of two adjacent leaf nodes differ by at most one. A potential problem exists when the bounding box thin-plate energy is a poor fit to the data, that is, when large areas within the bounding box contain no data.
