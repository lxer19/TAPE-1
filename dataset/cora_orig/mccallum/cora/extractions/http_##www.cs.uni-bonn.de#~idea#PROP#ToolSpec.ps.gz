Reference: 1. <author> Name: </author> <title> Propagation Rule Compiler </title>
Reference: 2. <institution> Organization: University of Bonn </institution>
Reference: 3. <institution> Contact Person: Rainer Manthey </institution>
Reference: 4. <author> Scope: </author> <title> Passive Rule Design (B121), Active Rule Design (B122), Use of Generation Tools (C121), Transaction Prototyping (C131) </title>
Reference: 5. <author> Input: </author> <title> A Chimera schema </title>
Reference: 6. <author> Output: </author> <title> A set of definitions of object classes (delta classes), a set of view definitions (referring to the delta classes), and a set of triggers </title>

Reference: 8. <author> Interaction: </author> <title> The tool may be used in a completely automated manner (assuming default values). However, various forms of interaction with the rule designer can be envisaged. </title>

Reference: 1. <editor> Object Creation: create(class,state,oid) resp. </editor> <title> create_tmp(class,state,oid) The system generates a create event wrt. the class designated in the create statement: create(class). Additionally, we obtain events create(superclass) for all superclasses of the designated class to which the new object is implicitly inserted. </title>
Reference: 2. <author> Object Deletion: </author> <title> delete(class,oid) The system provides a delete event for the designated class: delete(class). Additionally, we obtain events delete(sclass) for all superclasses of the designated class and subclasses which included the deleted object before and which are not derived. </title> <type> 1 </type>
Reference: 3. <author> Object Specialization: </author> <title> specialize(class1,class2,oid,state) The system generates the single event: </title> <publisher> specialize(class1,class2). </publisher>
Reference: 4. <author> Object Generalization: </author> <title> generalize(class1,class2,oid) The system generates the single event: </title> <publisher> generalize(class1,class2). </publisher>
Reference: 5. <author> Attribute Modification: </author> <title> modify(class.att,oid,value) The system generates an event modify(class.att) and, additionally, events modify(sclass.att) for all superclasses which define the changed attribute and for all extensional subclasses which include the modified object. 1 For derived classes the system need not generate events, as triggers may not refer to updates on derived concepts.

Reference: 6. <author> Change of Persistency Status: </author> <title> make_persistent(class,oid) This operation does not induce subsequent updates on the database which are due to deductive rules. Thus, for the propagation rule compiler it is not relevant which events are generated on account of such an update. </title>

Reference: 1. <institution> If C is the type of an atomic attribute of O 0 (either defined individually or a record component), </institution> <note> its value is set to null. </note>

Reference: 1. <institution> The relevant parameters of the event are retrieved. </institution>
Reference: 2. <institution> All potential induced updates are computed. </institution>
Reference: 3. <institution> The effectiveness of the identified induced update is checked. </institution>
