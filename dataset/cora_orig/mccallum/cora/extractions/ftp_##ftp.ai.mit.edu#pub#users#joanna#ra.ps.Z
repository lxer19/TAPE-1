Reference-contexts: But technically, the term can be sincerely applied to these programs if one believes this definition from the opening of the Proceedings of the First International Symposium on Robotics Research <ref> [Brady & Paul 84] </ref>[Hallam 91a] | Robotics is the intelligent connection of perception to action. 79 So to what extent does this project conform to Brook's description of a Crea- ture? (see page 15) Creatures need to be able to respond quickly and appropriately to changes in their environment.

Reference-contexts: One particularly well known implementation is Ghengis <ref> [Brooks 89] </ref>, a six-legged cockroach-inspired robot that trained its own neural nets to learn to walk. It was eventually capable of pursuing people over rough terrain. Most robotics projects written outside of Brooks own laboratory tend not to use a strict subsumption, but to use a modified or "hybrid" approach.

Reference-contexts: This new paradigm, though designed for robotics, seemed quite applicable to other areas. In fact, the lecturer, John Hallam, made a point of the way human 1 See <ref> [Brooks 91a] </ref> for a brief overview of recent work in this area, espe cially. [Dennett & Kinsbourne 90] 4 actions seem to be encoded into functions higher than what we consider reflexes, but lower than conscious control. <p> century, Artificial Intelligence has mostly followed the same logical/sequential approach to problem solving used in Computer Science. 1 Although significant and interesting progress has been made in this way, for sev 1 For a thorough review of the history of AI paradigms in relation to Psychology and Computer Science, see <ref> [Brooks 91a] </ref>. 10 eral reasons some researchers have begun to doubt this as a model for most of human cognition: 2 * Sequential processing often takes hundreds or even thousands of steps for the kinds of things people do very quickly, such as recalling a person's identity from their face. <p> These criteria have been used as the main guidelines for implementing this project. 16 Summary Brooks gives a very telling summary of the difference between traditional AI approaches and these behaviour-based approaches in <ref> [Brooks 91a] </ref>. In traditional AI, programs are broken into information processing units, such as perception, planning, modeling, and learning, and intelligent behaviour such as avoiding obstacles and moving are expected to emerge from the interaction of these components. <p> The file lists each chord explicitly, but only one example of each chord type need be generated by hand, I have a utility program written in PERL which shifts this pattern for each additional pitch class. 3 I later read in <ref> [Brooks 91a] </ref> Brooks' criticism of neural nets under subsumption on the basis that "they do not have simple translation into time varying perception... <p> However, I abandoned this course for several reasons: * The statistical theory underlying such nets tends to be unsound. [Willshaw 92] * Recent work by Brooks explicitly condemns complex, non-biologically tractable neural nets. <ref> [Brooks 91a] </ref> (See footnote page 47) * I realised I would not have time to develop and train so complex a net myself and was reluctant to include more external software into the system. I decided using standard statistical methodology would probably be faster running and easier to program.

Reference-contexts: In other words, it is a form of interpretation, one of fundamental tasks of intelligence. The approach used for developing this program is a system of distributed intelligence called subsumption architecture. This is a methodology developed by Rodney Brooks at MIT for designing and controlling robots <ref> [Brooks 91b] </ref>. The strategy is based on a principle of developing individual competences which run in parallel with each other, each acting on its own inputs and creating its own outputs without regard for the existence of the other modules. <p> Design Strategy As part of my course work here at Edinburgh I took a robotics class called "Intelligent Sensing and Control." [Hallam 91b] This course covered different control strategies for the goal oriented behaviour of robots, one of which was a new strategy being developed at MIT called "subsumption architecture." <ref> [Brooks 91b] </ref> Where traditional robotic control systems were based on the idea of a central planner that directed activity, this system is based on individual behaviours which determine for themselves when they should act. <p> to make comparative studies of linguistic cognition." Is there another activity where you have temporal patterns that satisfy overlapping constraints in a symbolic way? [Roads 80] Rodney Brooks attributes much of the trouble roboticists have gotten into in the past to their tendency for running their robots in oversimplified environments <ref> [Brooks 91b] </ref>. He explains that this leads to misjudging which parts of a problem are difficult, or even important. I strongly suspect the same could be said about natural language in artificial intelligence. <p> A creature should do something, it should have a "purpose of being." Under subsumption, the purpose of being is defined in the goal of its higher-level functions. 15 Principles of Subsumption Architecture In the same paper <ref> [Brooks 91b] </ref>, Brooks outlines several criteria for a subsumption strategy approach. * Each layer should be engineered separately, and tested and debugged until flawless before proceeding. <p> Under subsumption, one is only concerned with the workings of one competence at a time. Some modifications were made to the standard for subsumption architecture delineated by Rodney Brooks in <ref> [Brooks 91b] </ref> in porting the theory to software. The most significant of these were: * The modules were implemented in an object oriented language (C++) rather than in hardware. * More complex data structures were used both within modules and for input and output.

Reference-contexts: A great deal of effort has been spent in the field of Knowledge Representation on these issues, but the solutions tend to be complex and difficult to generalise; essentially, they are unnatural. 2 This summary of the difficulties with symbolic processing is taken from a lecture by Nick Chater <ref> [Chater 92] </ref>. 11 There are two main alternatives to the symbolic/sequential approach. One is Parallel Distributed Processing, or Neural Nets. The other behaviour-based, multi-agent systems, such as Subsumption Architecture. 2.1.1 Neural Nets The neural network paradigm was originally inspired by research into animal brains.

Reference-contexts: These signals are recorded into Sun format audio files using their standard soundtool utility. 28 The Sun header sound files are then translated into another format (IRCAM) so they can be used as input to a utility called pvanal that comes as part of the csound digital audio processing package <ref> [CSO91] </ref>. Pvanal translates this into Short-Time Fourier Transformation frames. Each frame contains 129 frequencies that occur over a 256 millisecond time interval and their associated gains, in roughly ascending order ranging from 0 up to about 4000Hz. <p> The noise robot translates the information from note, timed and change into input for the csound program <ref> [CSO91] </ref>. It reports a note if its value has been consistent for at least two frames. This output is actually fairly confusing because the melody has been transposed entirely into a single octave, but if played simultaneously with the actual input the results can be compared.

Reference-contexts: The most closely related work in terms of unscored accompaniment I have found reference to is Roger Dannenberg's jazz accompanist system. It is designed to listen to a few bars of improvised jazz and to then to join in on "piano" and "drums". <ref> [Dannenburg & Mont-Reynaud 87] </ref>[Dannenburg & Mukaino 88] Unfortunately I was not able to track down the references in time to discover the approach he uses. There are many programs that involve having a computer follow a score (rather than improvise) in order to play along with live musicians.

Reference-contexts: Another is Matsushima et al.'s organ playing robot [T. Matsushima & Ohteru 85]. Other related systems worth mentioning are Longuet-Higgins music tracking program [Longuet-Higgins 87], and Peter Desain's rhythm tracker <ref> [Desain 92] </ref>. The former is purely symbolic, while the latter is implemented as a neural net. Both are tackling a quite different problem than this project. Treating only the rhythm aspect for a moment, both of these projects are trying to find the exact rhythm of musical melodic events. <p> Change is the module which actually subsumes chord to move it into time. The rhythmic competences could actually be seen as subsuming change. 51 6.1 Design Motivation The primary inspiration for using this method of beat recognition and prediction came from the work of Peter Desain. In <ref> [Desain 92] </ref> he describes systems which seek to identify the exact rhythmic nature of a melody, essentially by allowing neighbouring notes to compete for their proportions of a measure. In the course of his research, Desain experimented with predicting rhythmic events.

Reference-contexts: This information was necessary for correlating the files to the supervision keys, which are time indexed. This was achieved partly though the documentation, but largely through the use of the gdb gnu C++ debugger <ref> [GDB91] </ref>, a calculator, and a knowledge of the actual time extent of the over-all file. For the results, see the declarations and constructor functions for the Infft and Intrain class objects. <p> 80% of the time, but where there were differences I found the gradient strategy nearly always chose chords that were more consistent and believable. 7.3.2 Resetting the Expected Chord The way I first recognised the momentum problem was by observing the actual values of the rating comparison through a debugger <ref> [GDB91] </ref>. I focussed on a time interval between thresh signals where the output of note clearly defined the competing chord and not the expected one, but the competing one didn't win.

Reference-contexts: Though this is a loss of information, it is also a reduction in complexity, which is good both for a real time system and a time constrained project. 4.3.2 Net Topology The pitch class recognition network was originally conceived as being essentially a classic competitive net <ref> [J. Hertz & Palmer 91] </ref> with three differences: 1. the training would be at least partially supervised, 2. the output would not be binary, but quantitative, reflecting the loudness of the actual note. 3. the outputs of more than just the winning unit would be considered signifi cant. <p> In use, when an input pattern is presented, all of the weights which are activated for each output wire are summed, and if this number is more than a certain threshold, that output wire is considered to be on. (See <ref> [J. Hertz & Palmer 91] </ref>.) 46 The associative net appealed to me because it is particularly well suited for recognising the sorts of inputs I would have, and I thought the single-act training appropriate for this task.

Reference-contexts: For a more thorough discussion of the concepts behind the latter, see the next chapter, Theoretical Background. The second part explains the musical terminology as it is used in this thesis. For a better grounding in these 6 concepts I recommend the paper "The Perception of Music" by Longuet-Higgins <ref> [Longuet-Higgins 87] </ref>. 1.4.1 : : : with Respect to the Program This program is an example of distributed intelligence, which means that the intellectual activity takes place in multiple separate units which are not coordinated by any central control. <p> This is significant because the second pitch class, for example, may either be referred to as A] or B [, there being an actual slight difference in pitch in some tonal systems because the harmonic series that construct these two terms are different. (see <ref> [Longuet-Higgins 87] </ref>) However, within the context of this program, it will always be referred to as A] 2 . The most important unit of time within a song is the beat. <p> Another is Matsushima et al.'s organ playing robot [T. Matsushima & Ohteru 85]. Other related systems worth mentioning are Longuet-Higgins music tracking program <ref> [Longuet-Higgins 87] </ref>, and Peter Desain's rhythm tracker [Desain 92].

Reference-contexts: Since this behaviour-based methodology has been developed, there have been a number of successful robots built using it, including here at Edinburgh. These robots tend to be developed more quickly and to behave more dependably than robots controlled by traditional methods. <ref> [Maes 90] </ref>[Hallam 91b].

Reference-contexts: But the most interesting thing would be the idea of "learning", building a repertoire, particularly if it could still be done within subsumption. My current best theory for this would be to build a structure not unlike the mapping module in <ref> [Mataric 90] </ref>. Since many songs, particularly folk songs, have similar structures, one could envisage developing a net with the nodes being relative chords, and the songs being paths through the net.
