Abstract: We present a new Trellis Coded Vector Residual Quan-tizer (TCVRQ) that combines trellis coding and vector residual quantization. We propose new methods for computing quantization levels and experimentally analyze the performances of our TCVRQ in the case of still image coding. Experimental comparisons show that our quantizer performs better than the standard Tree and Exhaustive Search Quantizers based on the Generalized Lloyd Algorithm (GLA).

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, fixed the coding rate R, an optimal VQ requires computational and storage resources that grow exponentially with the vector dimension. Moreover, Lin in <ref> [1] </ref> showed that the design of an optimal Vector Quantizer is an NP-complete problem. The design of sub-optimal vector quantizers is an interesting alternative to scalar quantizers for applications that require good quality performances when a limited amount of computing resources is available.

Reference-contexts: We will demonstrate the performances of this new VQ based on a trellis structure and compare it experimentally with the standard Exhaustive Search and Tree Vector Quantizers.

Reference-contexts: Random Partitioning is used to partition the levels for the ESVQs on the branches. The stages are sequentially optimized, i.e. a local optimum for the stage i is found by using only information from the 0 : : : (i 1) stages. RQ joint optimization techniques described in <ref> [7] </ref> have not been useful to these experiments due to the excessive computational burden of dealing with 10-stages VRQ. In spite of their low computational complexity, sequential optimization and random partitioning perform well. We have not observed substantial performance increase using more sophisticated partitioning algorithms. 4.
