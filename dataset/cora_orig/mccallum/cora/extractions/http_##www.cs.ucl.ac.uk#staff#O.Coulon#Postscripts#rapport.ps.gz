Reference-contexts: N is the dimension of the space, and x 1 ; ; x N stand for the spatial coordinates. A demonstration of the uniqueness of the Gaussian kernel to construct a linear isotropic scale-space can be found in [ter Haar Romeny et al., 1991], and details are given in <ref> [Babaud et al., 1986] </ref>. 3.2 The discrete case The discrete case is shown to be more complex. For instance, the simple discretization of the Gaussian kernel does not guarantee the causality axiom.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm is described in figure 12. 5 Experiments Experiments were made on an auditory protocol realized with 9 subjects. For each subject we had one rest-condition acquisition, and one activation-condition corresponding to the passive listening to non-verbal speech-like stimuli <ref> [Belin et al., 1996] </ref>. The multi-subject analysis, performed with statistical parametric mapping software (SPM [Friston, 1994]), resulted in activations of the left and right superior temporal gyri (STG), with a marked left-biased asymmetry, and in the activation of the left prefrontal region.

Reference-contexts: This fact has been used for instance in pyramid representations. Moreover, chosing a logarithmic sampling along the scale and a logarithmic measure for the lifetime (the effective scale in contrast to the ordinary linear scale t) is the only way to introduce a dimensionless scale parameter <ref> [Florack et al., 1992] </ref>. This effective scale parameter, o , can be written: o = ln * where o 0 stands for the initial offset in scale and * is taken to be the smallest linear grid measure of the image device.

Reference-contexts: A strong hypothesis is made which supposes that the "task image" is the same than the rest one plus the searched activation (s). This hypothesis is obviously false but was shown to be sufficient for many studies. Actually, statistical methods of activation detection in PET difference images <ref> [Friston, 1994, ?, Worsley et al., 1992, Worsley et al., 1996b] </ref> take into account several rest images and several task-specific ones, and these images are averaged, which makes the hypothesis more valid but Functional activation detection and PET 5 imply other problems as we will see below. <p> of the differences, in terms of structure, between two conditions with a (more) "high-level" interpretation of these differences. 2.2 Individual detection Because of the highly noisy nature of the PET difference images, statistical methods have emerged in the field of functional activation detection, particularly the "statistical parametric mapping" (SPM) software <ref> [Friston, 1994] </ref>. These methods try to associate to each pixel a statistical value representing their "significance" : if the pixel value is significantly above the zero level in a lot of difference images, the pixel will be considered as "activated" (in a simplistic explanation). <p> For each subject we had one rest-condition acquisition, and one activation-condition corresponding to the passive listening to non-verbal speech-like stimuli [Belin et al., 1996]. The multi-subject analysis, performed with statistical parametric mapping software (SPM <ref> [Friston, 1994] </ref>), resulted in activations of the left and right superior temporal gyri (STG), with a marked left-biased asymmetry, and in the activation of the left prefrontal region. The rCBF increase is known to be in the range of 5-10%.

Reference-contexts: Generally, two parameters are used to decide whether a cluster in a PET difference image is salient or not: the extent of the support, and the intensity of its maximum <ref> [Poline and Mazoyer, 1994a, Friston et al., 1994] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This scale-space is constrained in such a way that its fundamental properties are known and useful. Its dimension is equal to the dimension of the image plus one (the new dimension is the scale). In the scale-space, one tries generally to detect particular events <ref> [Vincken, 1995, Gerig et al., 1995] </ref>, starting points of a segmentation or detection, or to study the behavior of basic structures [Kimia et al., 1995], particular points [Gerig et al., 1995, Lifshitz and Pizer, 1990], or complex structures [Lindeberg, 1994c, Pizer et al., 1994]. <p> In the scale-space, one tries generally to detect particular events [Vincken, 1995, Gerig et al., 1995], starting points of a segmentation or detection, or to study the behavior of basic structures [Kimia et al., 1995], particular points <ref> [Gerig et al., 1995, Lifshitz and Pizer, 1990] </ref>, or complex structures [Lindeberg, 1994c, Pizer et al., 1994]. We chose to develop a method derived from that proposed by Lindeberg. <p> Many authors have shown the interest of such a process in order to segment images or detect features in these images ([Monga et al., 1994], [Vincken, 1995], [Vincken et al., 1994], [Perona and Malik, 1990], <ref> [Gerig et al., 1995] </ref>, [Lindeberg, 1994c] chap. 11, [Jackway and Walker, 1995]). Following these goals, one can focus on particular objects in the image, on particular points associated to these objects (local extrema, zero-crossing of the derivatives, ..), or even on more "symbolic" primitives like boundaries.

Reference-contexts: The hypothesis of correlation was formulated in 1890 by Roy and Sherrington [Roy and Sherrington, 1890] and still prevails, although the coupling mechanism is still unknown and research are made to verify the validity of this hypothesis [Lou et al., 1987]. The reader could refer to <ref> [Horwitz and Sporns, 1994] </ref> (p.274) for a brief description of this point. The aim is to detect rCBF increases between two different states. Usually, one searches for increases between a reference, or rest, condition and another one, associated to a specific task.

Reference-contexts: Due to this problem, multi-subject studies using statistical methods can only present results which are common to a large number of subjects. This is the first reason for an individual analysis of PET difference images.The functional variability also becomes a field of research in itself <ref> [Hunton et al., 1996] </ref>, and this requires the developement of an individual method. This is a strong motivation for our work. Notice that looking for such a method does not mean that we restrict the analysis to images acquired from a single subject.

Reference-contexts: They do not follow a real multi-scale process and it is known that considering the behavior of the image across the scales is essential to give a robust description of the structures in this image (see [Lindeberg, 1994b], and the dynamic shape of Koenderink and van Doorn <ref> [Koenderink and van Doorn, 1986] </ref>). Intuitively, it is easy understood that a given structure gives a bad response at a scale level t and a better one at scale level t 0 : each structure has an "optimal" scale, depending on its size, intensity and neighbourood.

Reference-contexts: The primal sketch 13 4.2 Grey-level blobs 4.2.1 Definition The first step consists in extracting objects at each level of scale. These objects will be named grey-level blobs. Lindeberg has proposed in <ref> [Lindeberg, 1993a] </ref> a definition based on the properties to be required from a blob. His aim is to extract significant structures in such a way that they can be used for guiding computer vision applications such as camera focusing (many others applications are presented). <p> Thus they should be associated to at least one local extremum. These are the basic properties Lindeberg has considered to define the grey-level blobs. An intuitive definition of a grey-level blob is presented in figure 4 for the 2-dimensional case. <ref> [Lindeberg, 1993a] </ref>. From this 2-D illustration one can easily imagine the 3-D case : the support region is a volume, and the particular points keep the same definition. We present in next section the 3-dimensional construction, directly derived from this intuitive illustration. <p> If one considers a given grey-level blob, there is generally a corresponding blob at a slightly finer scale and at a slightly coarser scale. Our goal is to link these blobs to "follow" them across the scales, in order to get 4-dimensional objects called scale-space blobs <ref> [Lindeberg, 1993a] </ref>. Then the question is: is it always possible to link blobs in such a way ? Of course not. Structures do not exist in all scales, and they even tend to disappear as the scale parameter increases. <p> These events will be called bifurcations, they are illustrated by figure 7 (b-e). The primal sketch 18 d) creation e) split <ref> [Lindeberg, 1993a] </ref> We can then define a scale-space blob as the 4-dimensional object composed of grey-level blobs linked across the scales between two bifurcations.

Reference-contexts: But this scale parameter is not related to the way events occur. The ideal case is to have changes occurring linearly with scale. This case would be perfect not to overestimate either finer or coarser scales, which is our goal. It is well-known that events occur logarithmically with scale <ref> [Lindeberg, 1993b] </ref>. This fact has been used for instance in pyramid representations. <p> Since we only consider scales t 1, due to the noisy nature of PET difference images, we assume that equation 16 gives a good estimation of the lifetime. But we can mention the effective scale defined by Lindeberg <ref> [Lindeberg, 1993b] </ref> in order to get a scale parameter following the evolution of the number of extrema, i.e. of blobs.

Reference-contexts: For instance, the simple discretization of the Gaussian kernel does not guarantee the causality axiom. Moreover the continuous formulation of causality cannot be used in the discrete case because level curves have no direct correspondences. Lindeberg <ref> [Lindeberg, 1994a] </ref> has proposed a discrete expression of causality by requiring that if for some scale level t 0 a point x 0 is a local maximum (minimum) for the scale-space representation at that level (regarded as a function of the space coordinates only) then its value must not increase (decrease) <p> One can refer to <ref> [Lindeberg, 1994a] </ref> and [Lindeberg, 1994c] for precise theoretical considerations. Intuitively, equation 5 can be understood as a "discretized" version of the diffusion equation 1, and equation 4 can be understood as a "discretized" version of the Gaussian convolution in equation 2. <p> It can be shown that in a particular case the kernel T is exactly the discrete equivalent of the Gaussian kernel (the product of an exponential and a modified Bessel function, see <ref> [Lindeberg, 1994a] </ref> for details). <p> The next point is then the parameter determination (ff i ). Parameter determination In this section, the method of Lindeberg is developed for the 3-dimensional case, as described for the 2-dimensional case in <ref> [Lindeberg, 1994a] </ref>. In this case we get 2 parameters instead of one, which makes the 3D case more complex. <p> This demonstration is the 3-dimensional version of the demonstration given in <ref> [Lindeberg, 1994a] </ref> for the 2-dimensional case. No new idea is brought but the demonstration is essential to get relations 9 and 10 and determine our parameters.

Reference-contexts: They do not follow a real multi-scale process and it is known that considering the behavior of the image across the scales is essential to give a robust description of the structures in this image (see <ref> [Lindeberg, 1994b] </ref>, and the dynamic shape of Koenderink and van Doorn [Koenderink and van Doorn, 1986]). <p> Particularly, a necessary condition for preserving scale-space properties is that the corresponding convolution kernel T (see equation 4) must be unimodal both in the spatial and the Fourier domains <ref> [Lindeberg, 1994b] </ref>. The Fourier transform of T is obtained from that of K by assuming that the scale-space representation at scale-level t is computed from the original image using n iterations with a scale step t = t n and making t tend to +1.

Reference-contexts: In the scale-space, one tries generally to detect particular events [Vincken, 1995, Gerig et al., 1995], starting points of a segmentation or detection, or to study the behavior of basic structures [Kimia et al., 1995], particular points [Gerig et al., 1995, Lifshitz and Pizer, 1990], or complex structures <ref> [Lindeberg, 1994c, Pizer et al., 1994] </ref>. We chose to develop a method derived from that proposed by Lindeberg. This choice was made for different reasons : first, the definition of the structures of interests, i.e. the blobs, seemed to be adapted to what we were looking for. <p> Next section gives details about linear scale-space, and following sections describe the extraction of structures and the way we compute the measures. The reader could refer to <ref> [Lindeberg, 1994c] </ref> for more precise details about the method. 3 Linear scale-space: theory and implementation 3.1 The continuous case: axiomatic formulation The idea supported by the multiscale representation of a signal is to create a family of signals derived from the original, in which details are progressively removed (blurring). <p> One can refer to [Lindeberg, 1994a] and <ref> [Lindeberg, 1994c] </ref> for precise theoretical considerations. Intuitively, equation 5 can be understood as a "discretized" version of the diffusion equation 1, and equation 4 can be understood as a "discretized" version of the Gaussian convolution in equation 2. <p> Special properties of this case are given in <ref> [Lindeberg, 1994c] </ref>. Thus the kernel K corresponds to the 3D 6-connectivity neighbourhood. The effect of using different values of fl 1 and fl 2 are left to investigate. <p> Many authors have shown the interest of such a process in order to segment images or detect features in these images ([Monga et al., 1994], [Vincken, 1995], [Vincken et al., 1994], [Perona and Malik, 1990], [Gerig et al., 1995], <ref> [Lindeberg, 1994c] </ref> chap. 11, [Jackway and Walker, 1995]). Following these goals, one can focus on particular objects in the image, on particular points associated to these objects (local extrema, zero-crossing of the derivatives, ..), or even on more "symbolic" primitives like boundaries. <p> From their definition some simple rules of construction can be deduced, presented in the following algorithm (the same can be found in <ref> [Lindeberg, 1994c] </ref>-chap. 9): 1. Sort all the pixels in the volume according to their intensity. 2. For each pixel, in descending order: (a) Count the neighbours having a higher grey-level. (b) If there is no such neighbours, the pixel is a local maximum.

Reference-contexts: In the scale-space, one tries generally to detect particular events [Vincken, 1995, Gerig et al., 1995], starting points of a segmentation or detection, or to study the behavior of basic structures [Kimia et al., 1995], particular points [Gerig et al., 1995, Lifshitz and Pizer, 1990], or complex structures <ref> [Lindeberg, 1994c, Pizer et al., 1994] </ref>. We chose to develop a method derived from that proposed by Lindeberg. This choice was made for different reasons : first, the definition of the structures of interests, i.e. the blobs, seemed to be adapted to what we were looking for.

Reference-contexts: Generally, two parameters are used to decide whether a cluster in a PET difference image is salient or not: the extent of the support, and the intensity of its maximum <ref> [Poline and Mazoyer, 1994a, Friston et al., 1994] </ref>. <p> The extraction of grey-level blobs enables to find a comprehensive and pertinent set of potential activations without any threshold or parameter to choose. We emphasize on the automatic aspect of the process, which constitutes an important difference with the individual method proposed in <ref> [Poline and Mazoyer, 1994a] </ref> (this method depends on several thresholds).

Reference-contexts: Models have been proposed to simulate PET difference images <ref> [Poline, 1993] </ref>, and this hypothesis also becomes problematic for these simulations: if the only differences between the two conditions are the activated areas, one can represent the difference image as a noise image plus these areas. <p> But figure 15 shows that there is a weak correlation between activations and these measures : blobs identified as activation are often well ranked according to their extent, volume, or contrast. This is associated with the probabilistic approach <ref> [Poline, 1993] </ref>, which states that a large extent has a low probability to be produced by pure noise. Therefore, these measures can bring a differentiation criterion between blobs having quite the same amplitude: for two blobs having the same maximum amplitude we will prefer the one having the largest extent. <p> For instance, the fact that the same structure is extracted for several subjects is of great importance. This idea was already noticed by Poline in <ref> [Poline, 1993] </ref>: Il est probable que l'avenir des techniques individuelles se joue avec la possibilite d'operer des analyses globales sur l'ensemble des resultats "donnees individuelles" et "donnees moyennes".

Reference-contexts: The correlation between the two modalities is not evident but begins to be shown <ref> [Ramsey et al., 1996] </ref>. A fusion between the two modalities is planned. * Since most of the time we dispose of several subjects, the global information brought by the set could be used, even for an individual detection.

Reference-contexts: As PET images allow the visualization of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), they are used to detect activated brain areas. The hypothesis of correlation was formulated in 1890 by Roy and Sherrington <ref> [Roy and Sherrington, 1890] </ref> and still prevails, although the coupling mechanism is still unknown and research are made to verify the validity of this hypothesis [Lou et al., 1987]. The reader could refer to [Horwitz and Sporns, 1994] (p.274) for a brief description of this point.

Reference-contexts: Our purpose is to get these characteristics in an explicit way. Multi-scale methods aiming at describing an image from its behavior across the scales are currently numerous and have shown their relevancy in the fields of computer vision or medical imaging <ref> [Vincken, 1995, ter Haar Romeny et al., 1994] </ref>. Generally, they begin with the immersion of the image in a new space : the scale-space. This scale-space is constrained in such a way that its fundamental properties are known and useful. <p> This scale-space is constrained in such a way that its fundamental properties are known and useful. Its dimension is equal to the dimension of the image plus one (the new dimension is the scale). In the scale-space, one tries generally to detect particular events <ref> [Vincken, 1995, Gerig et al., 1995] </ref>, starting points of a segmentation or detection, or to study the behavior of basic structures [Kimia et al., 1995], particular points [Gerig et al., 1995, Lifshitz and Pizer, 1990], or complex structures [Lindeberg, 1994c, Pizer et al., 1994]. <p> Many solutions exist, presented for instance by Vincken in <ref> [Vincken, 1995] </ref>. The problem is often viewed as an "estimation" of the missing pixels (those which are outside the image, if we consider this image as a "piece" of an infinite one), and a variety of extrapolation methods have been proposed. <p> Many authors have shown the interest of such a process in order to segment images or detect features in these images ([Monga et al., 1994], <ref> [Vincken, 1995] </ref>, [Vincken et al., 1994], [Perona and Malik, 1990], [Gerig et al., 1995], [Lindeberg, 1994c] chap. 11, [Jackway and Walker, 1995]).

Reference-contexts: The lifetime The idea of using the lifetime is derived from an observation first introduced by Witkins in <ref> [Witkin, 1983] </ref>: intervals that survive over a broad range of scales tend to leap out to the eyes. In other words, if the lifetime of a scale-space blob is large, its saliency must be considered as high.
