Abstract: This paper initiates the study of weak proximity drawings of graphs and demonstrates their advantages over strong proximity drawings in certain cases. Weak proximity drawings are straight line drawings such that if the proximity region of two points p and q representing vertices is devoid of other points representing vertices, then segment (p; q) is allowed, but not forced, to appear in the drawing. This differs from the usual, strong, notion of proximity drawing in which such segments must appear in the drawing. Most previously studied proximity regions are associated with a parameter fi, 0 fi 1. For fixed fi, weak fi-drawability is at least as expressive as strong fi-drawability, as a strong fi-drawing is also a weak one. We give examples of graph families and fi values where the two notions coincide, and a situation in which it is NP-hard to determine weak fi-drawability. On the other hand, we give situations where weak proximity significantly increases the expressive power of fi-drawability: we show that every graph has, for all sufficiently small fi, a weak fi-proximity drawing that is computable in linear time, and we show that every tree has, for every fi less than 2, a weak fi-drawing that is computable in linear time.

Reference-contexts: Besides their theoretical interest, proximity drawings have been studied for their practical characteristics: neighboring graph vertices are clustered in the drawing, and adjacent edges tend to have large angles. Furthermore, proximity drawings are related to minimum spanning tree drawings, minimum weight drawings of triangulations, and Delaunay drawings (e.g., see <ref> [6, 10, 2] </ref>). The purpose of this paper is to initiate a study of weak proximity drawings, in particular, weak fi-drawings. A weak proximity drawing of a graph G is one that ignores requirement (ii) for traditional, or strong, drawings. <p> Surprisingly, it turns out that if fi = 2 and the region of influence is a closed set, then the class of w-<ref> [2] </ref>-drawable trees does not contain trees with arbitrarily large vertex degree.

Reference-contexts: For example, a tree that has a vertex of degree greater than five has no strong fi-drawing for any fi <ref> [3] </ref>. Thus the drawing in Fig. 1 illustrates a graph that is weak but not strong drawable for the circular disk proximity region defined by antipodal points. Also, characterizations and algorithms for strong fi-drawability have been devised only for a few classes of graphs. <p> For fi &gt; 2, let z 6= y be a point on the boundary of R [x; y; fi] such that d (x; y) = d (x; z). Then fl (fi) = 6 zxy.

Consider the graph G 0 that has an s-fi-drawing with the same set of points for the vertices as . From Property 2 we have that G G 0 . From <ref> [3] </ref> we have that in the above interval of fi values, s-fi-drawable graphs are planar; hence, G 0 is planar. The conclusion follows from the maximality of G. Further consideration of planar triangulated graphs reveals a connection between weak proximity drawability and angular resolution. Lemma 10. <p> From Lemma 15, an upper bound can be deduced for the maximum vertex degree of w-fi-drawable trees for 2 &lt; fi 1. It is worth noticing that the same lemma, and hence the same upper bounds, hold for s-fi-drawable trees <ref> [3] </ref>. Thus, we can use Lemma 15 and Property 1 to import the results of [3] on the s-fi-drawability of trees. fi T (fi) T [fi] cos (2=5) T 4 T (fi) T 5 T 4 T [fi] T 5 cos (2=5) T 4 T (fi) T 5 T [fi] = <p> It is worth noticing that the same lemma, and hence the same upper bounds, hold for s-fi-drawable trees <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: One class of problems concerns the use of the weak model for proximity regions other than fi-regions. For example weak rectangle of influence drawings <ref> [8] </ref> could be tackled. It is easy to see that any planar graph that admits an st-orientation without transitive edges has a weak rectangle of influence drawing.

Weak and strong visibility drawings (e.g., see <ref> [15] </ref>) can be considered as a particular class of proximity drawings. In the field of visibility drawing, the coordinated study of both strong and weak types of drawings led to deep and practical results.
