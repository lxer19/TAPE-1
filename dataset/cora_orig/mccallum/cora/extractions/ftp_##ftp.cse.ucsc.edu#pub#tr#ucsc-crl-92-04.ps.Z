Reference-contexts: It then decides whether to perform a read or write operation. The choice is made randomly such that a read to write ratio of 4:1 is achieved. Experimental studies of access patterns have shown this to be a reasonable assumption <ref> [13, 1] </ref>. The user process then activates the read or write routine, which, in turn, activates the appropriate routines to effect the operation for the modeled protocol. If the access fails, the process is repeated on the remaining sites with replicas, until it is successful or all replicas are exhausted.

Reference-contexts: Several techniques have been used to evaluate the availability of replicated data. Combinatorial models are very simple to use [19] but cannot represent complex recovery modes like those found in voting protocols with witnesses [16] and dynamic voting protocols <ref> [2] </ref>. Stochastic models have been extensively used to study replication protocols [5, 16, 15] but suffer from two important limitations: First, stochastic models quickly become intractable unless all failure and repair processes have exponential distributions. <p> Unlike MCV and other static voting protocols, dynamic voting protocols exclude from quorum computations all replicas and witnesses that have become unreachable until they again become reachable and can be reintegrated into the current majority <ref> [2, 5, 11] </ref>. The optimistic dynamic voting protocol uses sets of site names, called partition sets, to record the identity of the replicas and witnesses that belong to the current majority. These partition sets are maintained at each site holding a replica or a witness.

Reference-contexts: The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section two introduces voting protocols with volatile witnesses. Section three discusses our simulation model and section four presents our results. Finally, our conclusions are presented in section five. 2. Voting protocols with volatile witnesses Majority consensus voting (MCV) <ref> [3] </ref> ensures the consistency of replicated data objects by requiring that all read and write requests collect the votes of a majority of replicas. MCV offers the important advantage of operating correctly in the presence of network partitions.

Reference-contexts: Witnesses [16] are small entities that keep track of the state of a replicated data object but hold no data. They are used by replication control protocols to reduce the number of replicas required to achieve a given 1 level of availability <ref> [4, 8] </ref>. There have been recent propo-sals to store these witnesses in volatile storage [18] and to regenerate witnesses that fail instead of waiting for them to recover [15].
