Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Parity games are infinite duration two-player games played on graphs. From the results of Emerson, Jutla and Sistla <ref> [EJS93] </ref> it follows that the problem of deciding the winner in parity games is equivalent via linear time reductions to the modal -calculus model checking. (In fact, they show the equivalence of the modal -calculus model checking and the non-emptiness problem for automata on infinite trees with parity acceptance conditions [Mos84, <p> It is an easy exercise to show the equivalence of the non-emptiness problem for parity automata and the problem of deciding the winner in parity games.) The modal -calculus model checking problem is known to be in the complexity class NP " co-NP <ref> [EJS93] </ref>, so it is considered unlikely to be NP-complete. On the other hand no polynomial time algorithms for it have been found so far. The modal -calculus is a powerful logic for specifying properties of finite state distributed and reactive systems.

Reference-contexts: To obtain the result claimed in the title we proceed in two steps. First we show a polynomial time reduction of parity games to the mean payoff games of Ehrenfeucht and Mycielski <ref> [EM79] </ref>. A polynomial time reduction of parity games to mean payoff games has been independently obtained by Puri [Pur95] and Jerrum (see [Sti95, Sti96]). Next, using results of Zwick and Paterson [ZP96], we argue that the problem of deciding the winner in mean payoff games is in UP " co-UP. <p> The play is winning for player 0 if max is even. Definition 2 (Mean-payoff game) A mean payoff game <ref> [EM79] </ref> is a quadruple (A; ; d; w), where A = (V; V 0 ; V 1 ; E) is an arena, and d are natural numbers, and w : E ! fd; : : : ; 1; 0; 1; : : : ; dg is a function assigning an integer <p> Memoryless determinacy for parity games was shown by Mostowski [Mos91], and independently by Emerson and Jutla [EJ91], and for mean payoff games by Ehrenfeucht and Mycielski <ref> [EM79] </ref>, and by Gurvich, Karzanov, and Khachiyan [GKK88]. Theorem 4 The problem of deciding the winner in a parity game reduces in polynomial time to the problem of deciding the winner in a mean payoff game. <p> Let G = (A; ; d; w) be a mean payoff game. Ehrenfeucht and Mycielski <ref> [EM79] </ref> and independently Gurvich, Karzanov, and Khachiyan [GKK88] have shown that for every vertex v 0 of the arena A there exists a number (v 0 ), called the value of G in v 0 , such that the following two conditions hold: 1. player 0 has a memoryless strategy such

Reference-contexts: Interestingly, to our best knowledge, all problems appearing in literature known to be in NP " co-NP are in fact in UP " co-UP as well (e.g., primality has been shown to belong to UP " co-UP by Fellows and Koblitz <ref> [FK92] </ref>). 2 Games We consider infinite duration games played by two players (player 0 and player 1) on finite graphs called arenas.

Reference-contexts: Box 800, Oxford, OX5 1DX, UK. A nondeterministic Turing machine is called unambiguous if for every input it has at most one accepting computation. The complexity class UP is the class of problems recognizable by unambiguous polynomial time nondeterministic Turing machines (e.g., see pages 283-284 in <ref> [Pap94] </ref>). In other words, UP is the class of problems having unique short certificates (where short means "of length polynomial in the size of the instance of the problem") checkable in polynomial time.

Essentially the same reduction has been given by Puri <ref> [Pur95] </ref>. A reduction of parity games to mean payoff games has been also obtained by Jerrum [Sti96]. Our reduction relies on memoryless determinacy of both parity and mean payoff games.

We have failed, however, to devise a polynomial time algorithm to check that a signature assignment is indeed canonical. Instead, we relate parity games to mean payoff games by providing in Section 3 a simple reduction from the former to the latter. <p> Unfortunately, we have failed to devise a polynomial time algorithm to check whether a vector hx v i v2V is indeed the vector of the values of the game. Moreover, whereas it is straightforward to extract a winning strategy in a parity game from the canonical signature assignment <ref> [Wal96] </ref>, here it is not at all clear to us how to do it efficiently given just the values of the mean payoff game.

Reference-contexts: A polynomial time reduction of parity games to mean payoff games has been independently obtained by Puri [Pur95] and Jerrum (see [Sti95, Sti96]). Next, using results of Zwick and Paterson <ref> [ZP96] </ref>, we argue that the problem of deciding the winner in mean payoff games is in UP " co-UP. Before we proceed with the technical part of this note let us comment on the relationship between the complexity classes UP " co-UP and NP " co-NP. <p> Note that having a reduction with polynomial values of the weight function would imply that parity games are in P, as a polynomial time algorithm for mean payoff games with polynomial weights is given by Zwick and Paterson <ref> [ZP96] </ref>. 4 The UP " co-UP upper bound Our aim now is to show that deciding the winner in mean payoff games is in UP " co-UP. Let G = (A; ; d; w) be a mean payoff game. <p> In order to get the UP " co-UP upper bound on the complexity of mean payoff games we use the following result of Zwick and Paterson <ref> [ZP96] </ref>. Theorem 6 (Zwick and Paterson [ZP96]) The problem of deciding the winner in a mean payoff game reduces in polynomial time to the problem of deciding the winner in a discounted mean payoff game. <p> In order to get the UP " co-UP upper bound on the complexity of mean payoff games we use the following result of Zwick and Paterson <ref> [ZP96] </ref>. Theorem 6 (Zwick and Paterson [ZP96]) The problem of deciding the winner in a mean payoff game reduces in polynomial time to the problem of deciding the winner in a discounted mean payoff game. Hence it suffices to provide unique short certificates for winning strategies in discounted mean payoff games. Zwick and Paterson [ZP96] have shown <p> and Paterson <ref> [ZP96] </ref>) The problem of deciding the winner in a mean payoff game reduces in polynomial time to the problem of deciding the winner in a discounted mean payoff game. Hence it suffices to provide unique short certificates for winning strategies in discounted mean payoff games. Zwick and Paterson [ZP96] have shown that optimal memoryless strategies for both players exist also in discounted mean payoff games. <p> The crucial property which allows us to quickly check whether some hx v i v2V is the vector of the values of a discounted mean payoff game is the following characterisation due to Zwick and Paterson <ref> [ZP96] </ref>. Theorem 7 (Zwick and Paterson [ZP96]) The vector = h (v)i v2V of the values of the discounted mean payoff game G is the unique solution of the following system of equations x v = max (v;u)2E (1 ) w (v; u) + x u if v 2 V 0 <p> The crucial property which allows us to quickly check whether some hx v i v2V is the vector of the values of a discounted mean payoff game is the following characterisation due to Zwick and Paterson <ref> [ZP96] </ref>.

The co-UP upper bound follows easily, because by the existence of optimal strategies <ref> [ZP96] </ref> player 0 does not have a winning strategy from a vertex v 0 in the game G if and only if (v 0 ) &lt; , so it can be directly read from the vector of the values of the game.
