Abstract: So we have taken care of full graphs with forbidden subgraph A. Now we take care of full graphs containing subgraph B. We will break up such graphs into at most one triangle (i.e. two vertices which both contain a single vertex, directed arcs, and singletons with the smallest possible number of the latter. See Figure 3.3.) As in previous cases, classes will be ordered lexicographically based on number of singletons. First we show that the dominant class predominates over any such graph, which according to the above partition, will contain a triangle. There are 5 ways to connect a singleton to a triangle without creating two directed arcs (compared to 8 for the dominant class), and 56 ways to connect a directed arc to a triangle (compared to 64 for the dominant class.) Now we consider subgraph B. The number of ways to connect a singleton to subgraph B without forming two directed arcs or a triangle is 8, 7 if you discard the disjoint case which we handle separately below. The number of ways to connect subgraph B to a directed arc without forming a triangle and a directed arc is 39, which is less than 64 for the dominant class. We now handle the disjoint case. We consider the number of ways of connecting a B graph plus a singleton entirely disjoint from B (call this configuration B fl ) to a singleton or to a directed arc. There are fourteen ways to connect B fl to another singleton without reducing the number of singletons by forming a directed arc or a triangle. This compares to 16 for the dominant class. There are 230 ways to connect a directed arc to this configuration, as compared to 256 for the dominant class. This completes the proof.
