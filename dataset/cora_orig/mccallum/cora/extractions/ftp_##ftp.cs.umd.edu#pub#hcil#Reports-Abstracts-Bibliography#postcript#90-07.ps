Title: Human V alues and the Future of T echnology: A Declaration of Empowerment

Abstract: We must learn to balance the material wonders of technology with the spiritual demands of our human nature." We can make a difference in shaping the future by ensuring that computers "serve human needs (Mumford, 1934)." By making explicit the enduring values that we hold dear we can guide computer system designers and developers for the next decade, century, and thereafter . After setting our high-level goals we can pursue the components and seek the process for fulfilling them. High-level goals might include peace, excellent health care, adequate nutrition, accessible education, communication, freedom of expression, support for creative exploration, safety, and socially constructive entertainment. Computer technology can help attain these high-level goals if we clearly state measurable objectives, obtain participation of professionals, and design effective human-computer interfaces. Design considerations include adequate attention to individual differences among users, support of social and organizational structures, design for reliability and safety, provision of access by the elderly, handicapped, or illiterate, and appropriate user controlled adaptation. With suitable theories and empirical research we can achieve ease of learning, rapid performance, low error rates, and good retention over time, while preserving high subjective satisfaction. To raise the consciousness of designers and achieve these goals, we must generate an international debate, stimulate discussions within organizations, and interact with other intellectual communities. This paper calls for a focus on the "you" and "I" in developing improved user interface (UI) research and systems, offers a Declaration of Empowerment, and proposes a Social Impact Statement for major computing projects.

Reference-contexts: Lessons from research on elderly or handicapped use of computers will undoubtedly improve access for all. Recognition of the value of participatory design and computersupported collaborations will open the door to novel technologies that counter the negative effects of competitiveness and support a more cooperative spirit <ref> (Eisler , 1987) </ref>. Not all commentators are as optimistic. Many critics are concerned that computing can be "de-skilling," in that users may lose their skills and abilities as computers take on more components of their jobs.

Reference-contexts: However , even with a positive attitude, inventing the future is not easy. As scientists and technologists we must begin with a belief that we can influence the future of technology <ref> (Florman, 1976) </ref>. This seems a realistic goal since each day corporations and government agencies choose which technologies to support and thereby shape the future.

Reference-contexts: In short, corporations are likely to support a suitable plan. Directors of research and corporate officers might be invited to national and international planning sessions to coordinate activity <ref> (Jin, 1990) </ref>. Government officials and agencies in the United States and other countries can often become leaders in these novel directions. For example, the U. S. Office of Technology Assessment convenes working groups addressing novel technologies which might recommend ways to apply the Declaration of Empowerment.

Reference-contexts: Sometimes predefined objective criteria can be applied to a task, but often human values must be applied and flexibility in decision-making is a necessity (Weizenbaum, 1976). With increased automation it is often beneficial to reconsider the balance between high-tech and high-touch <ref> (Naisbitt, 1982) </ref>. Some examples may help to clarify this issue.

Reference-contexts: devices and strategies - display design to increase legibility, readability, and comprehensibility - color, animation, graphics, sound, video, tactile feedback - workstation physical design and ergonomics - response time impact In addition, user interface researchers and designers can benefit from improved theories that refine psychological theories in this new field <ref> (Norman, 1988) </ref>. However, while we adhere to the rigorous, reductionist scientific method, we must retain the holistic, intuitive, subjective, contextual, and experiential perspectives.

Reference-contexts: Design to accommodate playfulness, romance, sadness, etc. - Cultural differences. Understand the impact of diverse languages, customs, religion - Explore application of computing to a wider variety of tasks This list of broadened issues will keep several generations of researchers and designers gainfully occupied <ref> (Shneiderman, 1986) </ref>. I believe that the inclusion of the philosophical foundations and attention to the fundamental concerns described in Section 2, can lead to novel and useful scientific discoveries and exciting technology. In short, expanding our philosophical horizon can lead to better science.
