Abstract: Many real world planning domains are complex and uncertain, preventing complete a priori planning. However, real world planners can also rely on runtime information to facilitate additional planning during execution. The completable approach to planning introduces the idea of complet-able steps, which represent deferred planning decisions. Through completable steps, a planner can defer particular goals until execution time, when additional information may be used for their achievement. To maintain the provably correct nature of plans afforded by classical planning, com-pletable steps have the additional requirement of achievability. Unfortunately, without additional higher-order knowledge for reasoning about ach-ievability, proving achievability becomes infeasible for any real world domain. We thus developed an incremental approach for learning completable plans. Using this approach, instead of proving ach-ievability a planner uses feedback from its experience with the real world to construct completable plans which cover an increasing space of situations. This approach to real-world planning has been successfully tested in a simple simulated ro bot navigation domain.

Reference-contexts: The ability to evaluate the utility of plans further enhances the ability of a system to adapt its behavior to different problem distributions by allowing it to learn only useful plans. 5 DISCUSSION Other approaches to planning in the real world include reactive planning <ref> [Agre87, Mitchell90, Schoppers87] </ref>, deferred planning [Krebsbach92], and replanning from failure, all of which address planning in dynamic, unpredictable domains. Completable planning provides an alternative for the many real-world domains where prior uncertainty is such that the general behavior of the world can still be predicted fairly accurately.

Reference-contexts: Next, we present the incremental explanation-based learning strategy we developed for learning completable plans. Finally, we discuss some experiments conducted in a simulated robot domain to test the completable approach to planning. 2 COMPLETABLE PLANNING We discuss completable planning within the TWEAK formalization of classical nonlinear planning <ref> [Chapman87] </ref>. This formalism uses a situation-based representation, where the state of the world is represented by a set of propositions called a situation, and state changes are achieved through operators.

Reference-contexts: Our learning approach to increased coverage is an alternative to probabilistic methods such as that used in [Drummond90]. Our learning approach is similar to other incremental approaches, such as <ref> [Chien94, DeJong93, Laird88, Mos-tow87] </ref>. However, while these approaches are motivated primarily by the computational intractability of correct planning, ours is motivated by the insufficiency of prior information.

Reference-contexts: A completor is an implementation of the mapping defined by a completion function and an identification function. For example, the completors we address with our learning strategy directly implement the completion function as a set of situation-action rules. In our previous work <ref> [Gervasio90] </ref>, we developed completors using iterative control and continuous monitoring.

Reference-contexts: The method we chose by which to address the utility problem-- i.e. learning useful contingent and completable plans--is based on gathering statistics on the plans' usefulness based on a given set of utility criteria, as in <ref> [Gratch92, Minton88] </ref>, after which non-utile plans can be discarded. 4 EXPERIMENTS To test our learning approach to completable planning, we ran the system on several experiments in a simulated robot navigation domain. All the experiments involved a simulation of a robot in a rectangular room.

Reference-contexts: The goal situation consists of conditions to be established by the contingent plan as well as all protected conditions established by previous steps as preconditions for succeeding steps. These conditions are determined using a validation structure similar to <ref> [Kambhampati90] </ref>. If the output situation chosen for the new contingent plan is the output situation of the com-pletable step, the new contingent plan increases coverage by adding a plan applicable to a new possible input situation (Figure 4) . <p> The procedure for incorporating new contingent plans into completable plans is similar to the method for plan reuse in <ref> [Kambhampati90] </ref>. However, that work focuses on adapting old plans to new problems, while our work focuses on building a general completable plan encompassing a class of problems. Our learning approach to increased coverage is an alternative to probabilistic methods such as that used in [Drummond90].

Reference-contexts: The plan is generalized using explanation-based learning <ref> [DeJong86, Mitchell86] </ref>. In constructing the base plan, the planner is allowed to make optimistic assumptions regarding the uncertain effects of operators provided it can also construct a (sensory) plan for verification.
