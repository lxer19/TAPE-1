Abstract: We describe a mechanism for scalable control of mul-ticast continuous media streams. The mechanism uses a novel probing mechanism to solicit feedback information in a scalable manner and to estimate the number of receivers. In addition, it separates the congestion signal from the congestion control algorithm, so as to cope with heterogeneous networks. This mechanism has been implemented in the IVS videoconference system using options within RTP to elicit information about the quality of the video delivered to the receivers. The H.261 coder of IVS then uses this information to adjust its output rate, the goal being to maximize the perceptual quality of the image received at the destinations while minimizing the bandwidth used by the video transmission. We find that our prototype control mechanism is well suited to the Internet environment. Furthermore, it prevents video sources from creating congestion in the Internet. Experiments are underway to investigate how the scalable probing mechanism can be used to facilitate multicast video distribution to large numbers of participants.

Reference-contexts: Example standards include ISO JPEG for single frame images, and ISO MPEG and CCITT H.261 for moving images <ref> [1] </ref>. In this paper, we consider video coders based on the H.261 standard. A central part of a codec is the compression/coding algorithm. In H.261, a picture is divided into blocks of 8fi8 pixels. A discrete cosine transform (DCT) converts the blocks of pixels into blocks of frequency coefficients.

Reference-contexts: Ergonomic studies and anecdotal evidence from the Internet demonstrate that people can use audio or video signals as long as the information content is above some minimum level which depends on the task in hand (e.g. <ref> [30, 2] </ref>). Thus, it is possible to transmit audio and video signals with lower bandwidth requirements at the expense of a slight degradation in user satisfaction, although user task performance will not be significantly degraded until the information content in the signal slips below the minimum level mentioned above. <p> This is important because the increased computing power of workstations and the availability of audio and video applications such as VAT [17], NV [11], NEVOT [26], and IVS [28] has led to a huge increase in the real-time traffic in the Internet. IETF meetings [4], seminars (e.g. the MICE <ref> [2] </ref> and Xerox seminars), shuttle launches, etc., are now regularly audio- and video-cast. <p> However, the loss rate is a not enough to evaluate the quality of the video at the receivers. Therefore, we have been carrying out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our control scheme within the MICE project <ref> [2] </ref> using questionnaires to discover user satisfaction with the quality of the images delivered to the receivers, and monitoring traffic rates and packet losses to detect network congestion.

Reference-contexts: This is in contrast to another approach to delivering real-time streams, which has focussed on changing the network architecture to meet the expected bandwidth and delay requirements of audio/video applications by introducing new admission control and switch scheduling mechanisms (e.g. <ref> [7, 21] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: It is important to get timely notification of congestion, but if the congestion is close to the source then all receivers will detect the congestion and will send a notification to the source generating an implosion of messages at the source <ref> [8, 31] </ref>. To prevent this, we require a mechanism for soliciting feedback information in a scalable way from the receivers. Given this feedback information, it is important to relate the state to the entire group of receivers within the context of the application. <p> and the number of receivers experiencing a particular network state. 3.1 Avoiding implosion Soliciting information from receivers in a multicast group of indeterminate size might create a so-called implosion problem, in which a potentially large amount of feedback information is sent almost synchronously from the receivers back to the source <ref> [8] </ref>. Solutions to this problem have included probabilistic querying, randomly delayed responses, and an expanding scoped search [31]. In a probabilistic scheme, a receiver responds to the request from a source with a given probability. <p> Refer to [15] for details. 8 Note that this criterion does not take into account possible random losses [24] which would be mistakenly considered as indicative of network congestion. at 10 receivers. An analysis of the feasibility of this sort of scheme can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. Once the source has received feedback information from receivers, it must convert the values into a global measure that it can use to adjust its output rate.

Our proposed feedback-based approach is already used in the Internet to control sources of data traffic <ref> [16] </ref>. However, the use of wide area multicast for the delivery of the real time streams creates additional problems in getting feedback from the receivers. <p> There, the feedback information is packet losses detected by timeouts or multiple acknowl-edgements at the source, and the control scheme is Van Jacobson's dynamic window scheme <ref> [16] </ref>. The control of multicast real-time data presents a new set of problems. The goal of TCP and other mechanisms for data traffic is to maximize throughput and minimize packet delay or loss, or equivalently to optimize some function of throughput and delay such as power.

There, the delay is set so that the bandwidth used by the state announcements is 1% of that by the audio stream <ref> [17] </ref>. In the increasing scope search scheme, the time-to-live (ttl) of the packets sent by the source is gradually increased. Therefore, packets travel further and further along the branches of the multicast tree.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we need to map the state variables to the perceived quality of the received image. A subjective measure of the perceptual quality, re ferred to as the Mean Opinion Score (MOS), has been defined and used extensively to design and compare video coding algorithms <ref> [18] </ref>. However, a MOS-based feedback mechanism would be impractical, since it would have to include the user in some kind of continual rating procedure. We thus have to rely on objective measures. Unfortunately, objective measures typically do not reflect the user's perception of an image [18]. <p> and compare video coding algorithms <ref> [18] </ref>. However, a MOS-based feedback mechanism would be impractical, since it would have to include the user in some kind of continual rating procedure. We thus have to rely on objective measures. Unfortunately, objective measures typically do not reflect the user's perception of an image [18]. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) is an objective measure of the spatial quality of the image. However, numerous experiments have shown that it is an imperfect measure because the perceptual quality in a sequence of frames depends on the quality of each frame in the sequence. <p> This suggests that more elaborate criteria be used by the source. Ideally, the source should be able to single out the parts (i.e. branches) of the multicast tree that experience high loss rates, and to treat these branches separately. One way to do this is to use sub-band coding <ref> [18] </ref>. However, this would require some cooperation from the routers. Furthermore, the H.261 standard is ill-suited to support sub-band coding 9 . Nevertheless, this approach is promising, and we are currently investigating it. We now describe the control algorithm used by the video coder.
