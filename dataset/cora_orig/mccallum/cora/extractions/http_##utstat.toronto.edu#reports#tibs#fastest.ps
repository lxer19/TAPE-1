Abstract: I compare the world record sprint races of Donovan Bailey and Michael Johnson in the 1996 Olympic games and try to answer the questions a) who is faster?, b) which performance was more remarkable? The statistical methods used include cubic spline curve fitting, the parametric bootstrap and Keller's (1973) model of running.
