Title: A Channel Access Protocol for Multihop Wireless Networks with Multiple Channels

Abstract: The Group Allocation Multihop Multiple Access (GAMMA) protocol is presented; this protocol schedules data traffic over a multi-hop, multi-channel, wireless network. GAMMA provides excellent performance and remains stable under all network load levels by dividing the channel into cycles; each cycle is composed of a combination of contention and data slots. Every station in the network has a unique channel for receiving data. Each station maintains a set of stations called the transmission group, only members of this group are allowed to transmit data collision-free to the station maintaining the group.

Reference-contexts: MACA does not use carrier sensing because carrier sensing does not provide information on the state of the channel at the destination node. Recently, floor acquisition multiple access (FAMA) protocols <ref> [5] </ref> have been proposed to allow for the collision-free transmission of packet trains.

On the other hand, PRMA <ref> [8] </ref> is relatively easy to implement but uses a fixed frame length which can lead to starvation if the number of active stations is large, and PRMA uses a data packet to make a channel reservation which is inefficient in case of an unsuccessful reservation.

Reference-contexts: How ever, this requires that the base station is line of site with every station in the network, which limits the utility of this protocol. The Multiple Access Collision Avoidance (MACA) protocol <ref> [9] </ref> attempts to solve the hidden terminal problem by using a Request To Send (RTS) / Clear To Send (CTS) message exchange. MACA does not use carrier sensing because carrier sensing does not provide information on the state of the channel at the destination node.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, most ad-hoc networks use a contention-based protocol for controlling channel access, and therefore, are not stable under all conditions. The most difficult problem associated with ad-hoc networks is that of hidden terminals <ref> [18] </ref>; hidden terminals exist when two or more stations can communicate with a third station, but not with each other. Several approaches have been used to solve this problem. The Busy Tone Multiple Access (BTMA) protocol [18] divides the transmission channel into a busy-tone channel and a message channel. <p> The most difficult problem associated with ad-hoc networks is that of hidden terminals <ref> [18] </ref>; hidden terminals exist when two or more stations can communicate with a third station, but not with each other.

BTMA uses a base-station to transmit a busy-tone signal for as long at it senses carrier on the message channel.
