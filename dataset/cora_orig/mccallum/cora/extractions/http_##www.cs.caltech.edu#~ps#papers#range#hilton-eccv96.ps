Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing an integrated 3D model from multiple 2.5D range images. A novel integration algorithm is presented based on a continuous implicit surface representation. This is the first reconstruction algorithm to use operations in 3D space only. The algorithm is guaranteed to reconstruct the correct topology of surface features larger than the range image sampling resolution. Reconstruction of triangulated models from multi-image data sets is demonstrated for complex objects. Performance characterization of existing range image integration algorithms is addressed in the second part of this paper. This comparison defines the relative computational complexity and geometric limitations of existing integration algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Hoppe et al. [4] presented a general method for constructing an implicit surface representation from unstructured 3D points. Polygonal models were then generated using a `marching cubes' approach <ref> [1] </ref>. The algorithm is `static' in the sense that all the image data is required prior to the polygonisation process. Soucy et al. [7] integrated range images using canonic subsets of the Venn diagram. <p> This defines the local surface continuity for each range image. For a single mesh M the field function, f (x), is constructed as the signed distance to the nearest mesh point, p (x; y; z). A binary function, b (x) = <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, is used to explicitly label field function values, f (x), with nearest points on the mesh boundary. <p> Continuous Implicit Surface Function: (a) Single mesh, (b) Two meshes from same surface, (c) Two meshes from different adjacent surface with opposite orientation, (d) Three meshes from three different adjacent surfaces. uses a uniform subdivision of 3D space to reconstruct a triangulated model of a manifold surface without boundaries, <ref> [1] </ref>. Extension of marching cubes to the polygonisation of a bounded implicit surface was addressed by Hoppe et al. [4]. The modified marching cubes algorithm only reconstructs the implicit surface for cubes which do not intersect the implicit surface boundary. <p> It is assumed that the number of redundant points between two overlapping images of N points is O (N ) and that the resulting boundary length of non-redundant subsets is O ( p N ). Previously complexity analyses were presented for methods I <ref> [1, 4] </ref>, III [8] and V [2].

Reference-contexts: Overlapping regions of meshes are eroded and the boundary correspondence found by operations in ? Supported by EPSRC GR/K04569. `Finite Element Snakes for Depth Data Fusion' 3D space. A local 2D constrained triangulation is then used to join overlapping mesh boundaries to form a single mesh. Boissonnat <ref> [2] </ref> and Rutishauser et al. [6] retriangulate two overlapping meshes using local 2D constraints on triangle shape. The four integration algorithms are completely different in their approach to constructing a single triangulated model. This results in different complexity, limitations and failure modes. <p> This approach assumes that the individual range images are uniformly sampled and measurement error, " &lt;< x. Throughout this analysis it is assumed that nearest point search is performed in constant time. Method V requires the neighbourhood of K nearest points. A k-D tree provides a suitable data structure, <ref> [2, 4, 6] </ref>. Pre-computation of the kd-tree is O (NlogN) complexity and space requirement is O (N). The K nearest point search is then computed in O (log N ) time.

Reference-contexts: This enables correct representation for surface regions of high curvature and different surfaces in close proximity, section 3.2. The weighted average of nearest points, step (vii), enables smooth integration of overlapping meshes using estimates of measurement confidence or blending functions, <ref> [3] </ref>. 2.2 Implicit Surface Polygonisation Polygonisation of implicit surfaces has received considerable interest for visulisa-tion in medical imaging and computer graphics. The `Marching Cubes' algorithm Fig. 1. <p> The computation time for the reconstruction of an integrated model of 25000 elements on a Sun sparc 10 was approximately 12 minutes. This is comparable to previously reported integration times [8]. 3 Performance Characterization A comparative analysis of integration algorithms is presented in this section. Hilton <ref> [3] </ref> defines integration algorithms in a common framework for direct comparison. Implementation is also discussed including requirements that were previously undocumented. The comparison of integration algorithms presented here focuses on two principal issues. Firstly, the computational complexity of each of the algorithms, section 3.1. <p> The step discontinuity constrained triangulation has computational complexity, O (N ). Time complexity of the critical sub-stages for each integration algorithm are outlined below. This complexity analysis presents the algorithms in a common framework for qualitative comparison, <ref> [3] </ref>. It is assumed that the number of redundant points between two overlapping images of N points is O (N ) and that the resulting boundary length of non-redundant subsets is O ( p N ). <p> Static computation requires all data to be present prior to integration, conversely dynamic computation allows sequential addition of new data. Additionally some integration algorithms impose inherent limitations on the sampling process, restricting integration of range images at a single resolution.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recent research has resulted in the independent publication of several algorithms that reconstruct triangulated 3D surface models of complex objects <ref> [4, 6, 7, 9] </ref>. <p> Given a method we want to be able to specify conditions on the original surface, S, and sample, X, that allow S 0 to be a reliable model. Hoppe et al. <ref> [4] </ref> presented a general method for constructing an implicit surface representation from unstructured 3D points. Polygonal models were then generated using a `marching cubes' approach [1]. The algorithm is `static' in the sense that all the image data is required prior to the polygonisation process. <p> Extension of marching cubes to the polygonisation of a bounded implicit surface was addressed by Hoppe et al. <ref> [4] </ref>. The modified marching cubes algorithm only reconstructs the implicit surface for cubes which do not intersect the implicit surface boundary. Application of a modified marching cubes algorithm to the mesh based implicit surface enables a 3D triangulated model to be constructed. <p> To ensure correct reconstruction of surface features the spatial subdivision used in the marching cubes algorithm must be less than the sampling resolution, x. Previous implicit surface based approaches <ref> [4] </ref> did not use a continuous representation, resulting in reconstruction errors, section 3.2. 2.3 Results Results of the reconstruction process for four objects are shown in Figure 2. All models were constructed from 8|10 range images. The bunny 2 and telephone 2 model consist of approximately 25000 triangular elements. <p> Holes in the original data are correctly preserved in the reconstructed model. Surface regions of high curvature are correctly reconstructed as continuous surfaces. Different surfaces in close proximity, that occur for thin object regions, are also correctly reconstructed. This overcomes the limitations of previous integration methods, <ref> [4, 6, 9] </ref>, in reconstructing surfaces of complex geometry, section 3.3. These results indicate that the integration algorithm reliably reconstructs the underlying surface topology.

[7]). IV: Mesh Zippering (Turk et al. [9]). <p> Nearest point search is common to all integration algorithms. Implemented as a brute force search the time complexity is O (N), where N is the number of points. Uniform subdivision of the 3D space facilitates a local search for the nearest point, <ref> [4, 9] </ref>.
