Abstract: Behavioural experiments with crickets show that female crickets respond to male calling songs with syllable rates within a certain band-width only. We have made a robot model in which we implement a simple neural controller that is less complex than the controllers traditionally hypothesised for cricket phono-taxis and syllable rate preference. The simple controller, which had been successfully used with a slowed and simplified signal, is here demonstrated to function, using songs with identical parameters to those found in real male cricket song, using an analog electronic model of the peripheral auditory morphology of the female cricket as the sensor. We put the robot under the same experimental conditions as the female crickets, and it responds with phonotaxis to calling songs of real male Gryllus bimaculatus. Further, the robot only responds to songs with syllable rates within a band-width similar to the band-width found for crickets. By making polar plots of the heading direction of the robot, we obtain behavioural data that can be used in statistical analyses. These analyses show that there are statistical significant differences between the behavioural responses to calling songs with syllable rates within the band-width and calling songs with syllable rates outside the band-width. This gives the verification that the simple neural control mechanism (together with morphological auditory matched filtering) can account for the syllable rate preference found in female crickets. With our robot system, we can now systematically explore the mechanisms controlling recognition and choice behaviour in the female cricket by experimental replication.

Reference-contexts: But the model is less adequate for other modalities, many of which are more salient to real animals. For example, in chemotaxis, the properties of the odour plume are critical determinants of the problem <ref> [1] </ref>. Braitenberg-type control is not appropriate in a task where the signal is highly dispersed (eliminating local gradients) and carried in specific directions by currents in the environment (for example around obstacles).

Reference-contexts: The task is commonly abstracted as a source signal whose value decreases with distance (smoothly or as a step function) and an animat that can sense the value and use it to control movement to the source. Braitenberg's <ref> [2] </ref> "vehicle 2" is the prototype. It is often argued that such simulations model the "essence" of the behaviour as such they should illuminate the understanding of any specific example of the behaviour. However, what these abstractions generally ignore are the real physics of signal propagation and detection.

Reference-contexts: While this model nevertheless sufficed to demonstrate the viability of basic mechanisms, it was difficult to make strong comparisons with data from the animal. These limitations, and details of the construction of a new robot addressing them have been described in detail in <ref> [5] </ref>. We showed there that the reimplementation enabled us to experimentally verify assumptions that had been made, but not tested, about how the cricket responds selectively to carrier frequency of the signal. <p> Consequently we had to produce a more complex neural control model than the one suggested in [10] and used to show the robot's phonotaxis to male Gryllus bimaculatus calling song in <ref> [5] </ref>. Especially, it has been extended to include an extra neuron on each side that performs integration over syllables. This simple neural system can account for much of the biological data that show a band-pass in crickets' phonotaxis to calling songs with different syllable rates. <p> The reason for this is the processing contained in the auditory pathway. As we have argued in [10], the peripheral auditory system of the cricket might provide directional cues through its structure, and we showed in <ref> [5] </ref> that this was indeed so when presenting such a system with male Gryllus bimaculatus calling song. <p> The mixed signal is sent through an RMS and an A/D converter to one of the Khepera's input channels. The same happens on the opposite side. c fl Lund, Hallam & Webb, 1997. Phonotaxis experiments In <ref> [5] </ref>, we used the robot with the auditory system described above to verify that the simple neural control mechanism could account for frequency selectivity, since the robot did phonotaxis to male cricket Gryllus bimaculatus calling song, and preferred calling songs with the right carrier frequency. <p> For N2 neurons, the decay rate, ff2, is set to 63/64, upper threshold, T 2 high , to 1725. These are empirical settings. The robot has its auditory sensory system's parameters set as in <ref> [5] </ref> (i.e. the two microphones are placed 18mm apart since 18mm corresponds to 1/4 wavelength of the carrier frequency, 4.7kHz, of male Gryllus bimaculatus calling song, the delays are set to 53s (the time sound propagates the length of 1/4 wavelength of 4.7kHz), and the mixers subtract the delayed signal from <p> When we play male Gryllus bimacula-tus calling song to the robot, the empirical settings of neural activation decay and thresholds described above result in the neural effect drawn on Figure 2. We have replicated the data from <ref> [5] </ref> with the ex-tended neural model. The results are shown in Figure 7. It shows that the robot with the extended neural models performs phonotaxis to male cricket Gryllus bi-maculatus calling song 1 emitted from a loud speaker in the arena. <p> For frequency selectivity, see <ref> [5] </ref>.) 1 The calling song was recorded at Life Science Department, University of Nottingham. The adult male cricket was sitting in a sand-floored arena and was recorded using a Maplin uni-directional dynamic microphone (YU-34) on a Marantz Stereo cassette recorder (CP230) from a distance of about 20cm.

Reference-contexts: If it is higher, the neuron will fire activation on to N2 on the same side. N2 neurons work in a similar way. The neural model suggested here is somewhat similar to the one suggested by Schildberger <ref> [7] </ref> who found low-pass and high-pass neurons in neurophysiological experiments with Gryllus bimaculatus. Based on this, Schildberger suggested a neural model with low-pass and high-pass neurons that process in parallel and then is ANDed together in order to produce the band-pass filtering observed in behavioural experiments (see Fig ure 4).

Reference-contexts: Neural model The original neural model was based on two properties of identified interneurons (AN1) known to be involved in phonotaxis in the cricket <ref> [8] </ref>. First, the long time constant of these neurons means that they act as low-pass filters for the temporal pattern of the signal: given repeated inputs they can only code distinct syllables (bursts of sound) below a certain repetition rate (for calling song structure, see Figure 1).

In the following experiments, we will show how the simple neural model suggested above together with the auditory mechanism implemented in the auditory sensor circuit can account for this data on cricket bandpass filtering of syllable rates. <p> Small parameter changes in decay rates and thresholds can set the preference of the cricket at different values, thus genetic predisposition to species specific rates can evolve. Adaptation in these parameters during the cricket's life-time can explain the age-related change in bandwidth of preference reported in <ref> [9, 12] </ref>. A more complex issue is raised by the biological data regarding the syllable duty-cycle: "one can alter the duty cycle [...] of the syllables from very small values to ca. 90%; the song remains attractive as long as the syllable repetition rate is near 30Hz." [12] pp. 319.

Reference-contexts: Our original implementation of a robot model (a LEGO robot prototype) of the cricket suffered from a number of limitations in this regard, particularly in that the processing of sound was relatively slow compared to the speed of movement <ref> [10] </ref>. While this model nevertheless sufficed to demonstrate the viability of basic mechanisms, it was difficult to make strong comparisons with data from the animal. These limitations, and details of the construction of a new robot addressing them have been described in detail in [5]. <p> Consequently we had to produce a more complex neural control model than the one suggested in <ref> [10] </ref> and used to show the robot's phonotaxis to male Gryllus bimaculatus calling song in [5]. Especially, it has been extended to include an extra neuron on each side that performs integration over syllables. <p> However, the model suggested here is simpler, since it directly produces the motor behaviour, and not only recognition of the right syllable rate. The reason for this is the processing contained in the auditory pathway. As we have argued in <ref> [10] </ref>, the peripheral auditory system of the cricket might provide directional cues through its structure, and we showed in [5] that this was indeed so when presenting such a system with male Gryllus bimaculatus calling song.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that we did nothing to control echos from the surrounding environment Syllable rate experiments Syllable rate experiments with crickets have shown that the female cricket responds only to calling songs with syllable rates within a certain band-pass. Weber and Thorson <ref> [12] </ref> report that Gryllus campestris females do "tracking almost perfectly near 30 syllables per second but [are] revealing reduced performance or [are] stopping entirely at rates below 20Hz or above 40Hz" [12] pp. 321. <p> Weber and Thorson <ref> [12] </ref> report that Gryllus campestris females do "tracking almost perfectly near 30 syllables per second but [are] revealing reduced performance or [are] stopping entirely at rates below 20Hz or above 40Hz" [12] pp. 321. <p> These data were found using trills, but Weber and Thorson also report that in performance tests for chirps with different syllable numbers, "we have uniformly found that the females' response increases as the number of syllable increases, as long as syllables are delivered at the natural (30-Hz) rate" <ref> [12] </ref> pp. 318.

At first glance our model suffices to explain this effect because it is only the onset of syllables that controls behaviour and the length of syllable is irrelevant. In fact the issue is more complex.
