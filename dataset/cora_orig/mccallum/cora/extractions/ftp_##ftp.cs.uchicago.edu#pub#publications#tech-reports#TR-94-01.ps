Abstract: We examine questions of optimality and domination in repeated stage games where one or both players may draw their strategies only from (perhaps different) computationally bounded sets. We also consider optimality and domination when bounded convergence rates of the infinite payoff. We develop a notion of a "grace period" to handle the problem of vengeful strategies.

Reference-contexts: We will also look at behavioral (probabilistic) versions of these strategies. These strategies are formally defined in Section 2.5. Gilboa and Samet <ref> [GS89] </ref> first looked at the question of domination in the bounded rationality model. They show that when Player II is limited to strategies realized by strongly connected finite automata (there is a path from any state to any other state) there exists a recursive dominant strategy. <p> Loosely, a vengeful strategy II may decide to punish Player I infinitely often based on some action Player I made early in the game. Page 3 Gilboa and Samet <ref> [GS89] </ref> handle vengeful strate-gies by removing these strategies from the set of strategies under consideration by studying only strongly connected finite automata for G II . We will use a different approach. Instead of restricting the types of strategies, we will use a modified definition of domination called eventually dominant. <p> In this paper we would like to look at smaller sets of strategies induced by computation devices of possibly limited resources. First we look at the regular strategies, the set of strategies realizable by finite automata. See Gilboa and Samet <ref> [GS89] </ref> for a formal definition. However we will not require the automata to be (strongly) connected. For an example of a finite automaton that implements a regular strategy for Prisoner's Dilemma see Figure 1. In this paper we would also like to look at strategies implemented by Turing machines. <p> All of these results hold for both the limit of the means and discounted payoffs. Proof sketches for these results can be found in Section 4. The first theorem is a reformulation of a theorem by Gilboa-Samet <ref> [GS89] </ref>. <p> In general for Matching Pennies, if C is any class of uniformly recursive strategies then C can be dominated by a recursive strategy. 4 Proofs of Main Theorems Sketch of Proof of Theorem 3.2: We modify the proof of Gilboa and Samet of Theorem 3.1 <ref> [GS89] </ref> by first attempting to move the automaton into a strongly connected component that has no paths leading out of that component.

Reference-contexts: In particular, we study optimal and dominant behavior as the discount factor approaches one. In Section 5 we discuss some further directions that we would like to see explored. 2 Definitions and Preliminaries We will use the standard definitions of finite automata and Turing machines.

Reference-contexts: In particular we will consider games where the sets of possible strategies for Players I and II are limited in a computational sense. Previous work has looked at limiting the players to strategies implemented by finite automata of size less than a given bound. See Kalai <ref> [Kal90] </ref> for a survey on "Bounded Rationality" for repeated games. However, finite automata are a very weak form of computation. In the real world human players are often armed with powerful computers to help them optimize their strategies in business and financial games.

Reference-contexts: For Prisoner's Dilemma, we show a very strong negative result: There exists such a strategy for Player II for which for all *, 0 * &lt; 1, there is no eventually *-optimal recursive strategy for Player I (Theorem 3.7). This result extends work of Knoblauch <ref> [Kno94] </ref>. For Matching Pennies we show that there does exist a dominant recursive strategy against polynomial-time strategies (Theorem 3.8). We also show similar results for discounted games where the payoffs in future rounds are multiplied by some discount factor over the current rounds. <p> However, against probabilistic finite automata, domination and even optimality cannot be achieved: Theorem 3.5 There exists a behavioral regular strategy for which there is no optimal rational strategy even for Matching Pennies. For Prisoner's Dilemma, Vicki Knoblauch <ref> [Kno94] </ref> creates two recursive strategies (1) (2) II where there is no optimal rational strategy for (1) II and there is an optimal rational strategy but no optimal recur sive strategy for (2) Now we consider the situation if II can be implemented by a polynomial time algorithm.
