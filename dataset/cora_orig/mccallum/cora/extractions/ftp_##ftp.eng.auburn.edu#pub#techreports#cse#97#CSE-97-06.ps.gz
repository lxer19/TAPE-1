Reference-contexts: It was found that the realistic appearance of dynamics shown by the animations resulted in novices inappropriate attributions of cause-effect relations to entities that were not so related. Hyperproof <ref> (Barwise & Etchemendy, 1994) </ref> is a system that was designed to teach logic to students by allowing students to construct logic proofs assisted by the computer. Its representations consist of geometric diagrams and logic sentences. Its diagrams show configurations of three-dimensional geometric objects.

Reference-contexts: One journal special issue (Narayanan, 1993) has been published, and five workshops exclusively devoted to the topic have been held during the last five years; proceedings of two are available in print (Damski & Narayanan, 1996; Narayanan, 1992) and that of another is accessible through the web <ref> (Blackwell, 1997) </ref>. Besides, a number of conferences 28 (e.g., Annual Conferences of the Cognitive Science Society, International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI National Conferences on Artificial Intelligence, IEEE Annual Symposia on Visual Languages) contain papers and tracks on diagrammatic communication. Acknowledgments.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, this is another avenue for future research. Formalizing diagrammatic interaction Bottoni and colleagues <ref> (Bottoni et al., 1997) </ref> have begun to formalize the processes of humans interacting with a computer system through a graphical interface. Their theoretical characterization is based on the communication perspective that Figure 2 illustrates.

Reference-contexts: A number of additional open questions regarding diagrammatic representations in education are raised in <ref> (Brna, Cox & Good, 1997) </ref>. Historical investigations of diagram use Historical and anecdotal evidence provide plenty of pointers to many famous scientists, including Galileo and Tesla, having relied upon mental imagery and external diagrammatic representations on their way to major discoveries and inventions (Nersessian, 1995; West, 1991).

Reference-contexts: The domain, range and type of this mapping are important. It may be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-toone or many-to-many. One-to-one E P and R n n mappings are common. For example, algorithm animation systems that show the inner workings of algorithms using animated diagrams 11 <ref> (Brown & Sedgewick, 1985) </ref> map data items to geometric primitives such as circles, size of data items to areas of the primitives, and relative positions of data items in a data structure to relative spatial locations of the corresponding graphical primitives. <p> Interestingly, visualizers did not show a preference for the graphical modality over verbalizers. But they were more adept at strategically switching between diagrammatic and sentential representations compared to verbalizers. Researchers in software visualization in general (Price, Baecker & Small, 1993), and algorithm animation in particular <ref> (Brown & Sedgewick, 1985) </ref>, strive to create static and dynamic diagrams for displaying the structure and operation of algorithms and software for the benefit of humans. In the case of algorithm animations, the target audience is students.

Reference-contexts: Scientists use of law encoding diagrams, a formal diagrammatic representational system useful for encoding laws or principles of a domain using diagrammatic structures, have been investigated <ref> (Cheng, 1996a) </ref>, and this representational system has been used in instruction (Cheng, 1996b). Eulers system of using circles to represent inclusion of elements in sets, and its role in syllogistic reasoning, is discussed in (Stenning & Oberlander, 1995). A similar notation, Venn diagrams, is thoroughly analyzed by Shin (1995).

Reference-contexts: Not surprisingly, geometry remains the most popular domain of application for intelligent diagrammatic reasoning systems (Lindsay, in press; McDougal & Hammond, 1993; Kim, 1989). Another popular domain has been qualitative spatial reasoning <ref> (Forbus, 1995) </ref>. The earliest system in this domain was WHISPER (Funt, 1980), which could solve problems of motion and stability of variously shaped blocks in a two-dimensional world.

Reference-contexts: There are four possible mappings: (1) S DR, (2) DS DDR, (3) S DDR, and (4) DS DR. (1) and (2) are commonly occurring mappings. For example, the CARTOONIST program <ref> (Hbscher, 1997) </ref> represents a microworld consisting of moving balls and stationary walls by mapping balls and walls to circles and rectangles on a computer display, and mapping the motions of balls to the corresponding motions of circles on the display.

(serial). Proceedings of the IEEE Annual Symposium on Visual Languages, </booktitle> <address> Los Alamitos, CA: </address> <publisher> IEEE Computer Society Press. </publisher>
Reference-contexts: Even when given a descriptive representation of certain kinds of problems, it has been observed that people tend to mentally image diagrammatic representations in order to solve them <ref> (Huttenlocher, 1968) </ref>. Thus for diagrammatic representations, the explicit availability of information, spatially localized organization of information, visual cueing of relevant prior knowledge, and support for constrained mental animation together serve to reduce the complexity of searching (in memory or in the diagram) for relevant information, and the complexity of reasoning.

Reference-contexts: Thus, informationally equivalent representations can have different computational complexity depending on the operations performed on them and the nature of the underlying information processing architecture that performs the operations <ref> (Larkin & Simon, 1987) </ref>. This probably explains why it has proved much harder to develop intelligent diagrammatic systems than intelligent symbolic systems. Additional resources.

It was found that the realistic appearance of dynamics shown by the animations resulted in novices inappropriate attributions of cause-effect relations to entities that were not so related.

Reference-contexts: When diagrams are accompanied by text (as is usually the case) an additional stage in comprehension is that of resolving coreference between the two media, i.e., making referential links between a noun phrase in the text (e.g., "the piston") and the diagrammatic unit that depicts its referent (e.g., a rectangle) <ref> (Novak & Bulko, 1993) </ref>. This step is crucial to constructing an integrated representation of the common referent of the text and diagram in memory as opposed to separate surface-level representations of the text and diagram. <p> This knowledge is applied to the diagram to make suitable modifications. Yip (1991) reports on a program called KAM for the qualitative analysis of nonlinear systems, which incorporates in its repertoire a capability to reason about spatial and geometric aspects of the phase space diagrams of such systems. BEATRIX <ref> (Novak & Bulko, 1993) </ref> is the only computer program that can process multimodal input diagram and text - reported in the literature. It accepts physics problems stated in the form of a diagram accompanied by a textual explanation, as is typically found in physics textbooks.

Reference-contexts: Interestingly, visualizers did not show a preference for the graphical modality over verbalizers. But they were more adept at strategically switching between diagrammatic and sentential representations compared to verbalizers. Researchers in software visualization in general <ref> (Price, Baecker & Small, 1993) </ref>, and algorithm animation in particular (Brown & Sedgewick, 1985), strive to create static and dynamic diagrams for displaying the structure and operation of algorithms and software for the benefit of humans. In the case of algorithm animations, the target audience is students.

Reference-contexts: In some cases, a rule of mechanical reasoning is available because it has been explicitly learned, or generalized from a series of trials in which simulation processes were used <ref> (Schwartz & Black, 1996a) </ref>. An example of such a rule is that every other gear in a gear chain turns in the same direction.

Reference-contexts: model of a device is best thought of as a hybrid reasoning process in which people can either use rule-based or imagery-based inference processes, depending on their knowledge of relevant rules of mechanical inference, and beliefs about the efficacy of the two types of reasoning processes in a particular situation <ref> (Schwartz & Hegarty, 1996) </ref>. One implication of this model is that prior knowledge is critical to accurate diagrammatic reasoning. Lowe (1994b) found that prior knowledge, such as the level of domain expertise and knowledge about diagramming conventions, determined the difference between expert and novice performance in a diagrammatic prediction task.

Reference-contexts: So it is not applicable to comprehension of abstract diagrams. Graphs are a particularly abstract type of diagram, and it has been suggested that comprehending graphs is a serial and incremental process similar to text comprehension <ref> (Shah, 1995) </ref>. Generating diagrammatic representations Most of us have drawn doodles - freehand sketches - during the course of thinking about some issue or solving a problem. For most designers, whether they be artists, architects or engineers, these sketches are not mere idle creations.

Reference-contexts: Narayanan and Chandrasekaran (1991) describes a system called DR that takes a different approach that is more congruent with the literature on mental imagery, that of activating a network of diagrammatic schemas called visual cases to find and apply matching cases, to the same problem. REDRAW <ref> (Tessler, Iwasaki & Law, 1995) </ref> is a system that takes as input diagrams that civil engineers typically draw to depict frame structures under load. The system uses the diagram to extract constraints that are then applied to symbolic knowledge to derive how the frame will deform.

Eventually symbolic languages became the predominant tool for conveying information, but the use of diagrams for information representation is still widely prevalent in all areas of human intellectual endeavor.
