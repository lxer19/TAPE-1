Abstract: We describe public key cryptosystems and analyse the RSA cryptosystem, pointing out a weakness (already known) of the RSA system. We define Lucas functions and derive some of their properties. Then we introduce a public key system based on Lucas functions instead of exponentiation. The computational requirements of the new system are only a little greater than those for the RSA system, and we prove that the new system is cryptographically stronger than the RSA system. Finally, we present a Lucas function equivalent of the Diffie-Hellman key negotiation method.

Reference-contexts: 1. Public Key Encryption Public-key encryption was first discussed by Diffie and Hellman <ref> [1] </ref> as a general principle. The new concept which they introduced was the use of trapdoor functions for cryptography. A trapdoor function is a computable function whose inverse can be computed in a reasonable amount of time only if a (small) amount of additional information is known.

Reference-contexts: (not too short, though), and the corresponding e worked out and published. 2.2 A weakness of the RSA System One weakness of the RSA system is that signature forging is possible if particular messages, chosen beforehand by the intending forger, are signed by the victim (see Goldwasser, Micali and Rivest <ref> [2] </ref>). This is called an "adaptive chosen-message attack" and it is possible because of the multiplicative nature of the trapdoor function used.

Reference-contexts: Both of these difficulties are not serious, as we now explain. Computation of Lucas functions can be done by a successive doubling technique, as in the "Russian peasant" method of multiplication (see Knuth <ref> [3, 4.6.3] </ref>). This technique is due to Williams ([10]).

Reference-contexts: They are sometimes written U n n ( P , Q ) , to emphasise their dependence on P and Q . They were first discussed by Lucas in <ref> [5] </ref>. A paper by Lehmer [4] extended the theory of these functions considerably. A more recent reference is the book by Ribenboim [8].

Reference-contexts: Since writing the initial version of this paper, we have found that a public key system very similar to LUC has appeared in the literature on at least two previous occasions, but in neither case were details of a practical system given. In <ref> [6] </ref>, Mller and Nbauer describe a public key system using Dickson polynomials. However, they give no practical way of computing these encrypted messages.

Reference-contexts: In [6], Mller and Nbauer describe a public key system using Dickson polynomials. However, they give no practical way of computing these encrypted messages. In a later paper <ref> [7] </ref> they show how to compute the encryptions in logarithmic time using a "square and multiply" technique; Williams' technique in [10] is an improved version of this algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The main content of this paper is to describe a new public key system, the LUC system, which uses a trapdoor function based on Lucas functions. In the next section, we describe the best-known public key system, the RSA system, invented by Rivest, Shamir and Adelman (see <ref> [9] </ref>). The mathematics of this system is described in some detail, in order to point out the similarities and difference with the LUC system. In section 3, we describe the LUC public key system, including a mathematical proof that it does work.

Reference-contexts: In [6], Mller and Nbauer describe a public key system using Dickson polynomials. However, they give no practical way of computing these encrypted messages. In a later paper [7] they show how to compute the encryptions in logarithmic time using a "square and multiply" technique; Williams' technique in <ref> [10] </ref> is an improved version of this algorithm. The results in Section 3 of that paper show that the Dickson polynomials they use are the same as the Lucas functions we use. In [11] Williams defines a rather complex system, using quadratic field extensions. <p> his functions X n are nearly the same as the Lucas polynomials we use ( 2 X n ( W 1 , W 2 ) = V n ( 2 W 1 , 1 ) ), and the computation method he gives for X n is based on his paper <ref> [10] </ref> which provides our computation method. However, his system has serious flaws (it was designed to obtain a specific result concerning factorisation, not to provide a practical cryptosystem) and our discovery that Lucas functions lead to a simple, strong, non multiplicative public key system is independent from his results. 2. <p> If we take Q = 1, then we get the simple relationship V ( P , 1 ) = V ( V ( P , 1 ) , 1 ) . (3.10) Lucas functions have been used to prove divisibility results (see Williams <ref> [10] </ref>), because there are relationships between the subscript of a Lucas function and the divisors of its value. <p> If p is an odd prime number which does not divide Q or D , and e is p , then Lehmer proved in [4] (see also Williams <ref> [10] </ref>) that U ( P , Q ) 0 mod p for any integer k . (3.11) It is also true that V ( P , Q ) 2 Q k ( 1 - e ) 2 mod p for any integer k ; (3.12) this can be derived from Lehmer's
