Reference-contexts: Many techniques for computation of optical flow have been proposed in literature. These can be classified into gradient-based, correlation-based, energy-based, and phase-based methods <ref> (Barron et al. 1994) </ref>. The gradient-based approach is dependent on the image flow constraint equation, which is derived from the brightness constancy assumption as well as the first-order Taylor series approximation (Horn and Schunk 1981). <p> Comparisons of our results with the previously reported results in Barron et al. (1994) and Szeliski and Coughlan (1994) are made to demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms. The angular measure of error <ref> (Barron et al. 1994) </ref> between the computed optical flow and the true flow is adopted in the experiments as a basis for comparison with the previously reported results. <p> 100% Our method (Gradient-based) 0:21 ffi 0:06 ffi 100% Table 1: Summary of Square 2 results (a) (b) 40 iterations of the incomplete Cholesky preconditioned CG algorithm. 20 Cholesky preconditioned CG algorithm is presented in Table 2, along results from other gradient-based methods in literature that yield 100% flow density <ref> (Barron et al. 1994) </ref>. Once again, our modified gradient-based regularization method produces more accurate optical flow than the other methods. The computed optical flow is shown in figure 3 (b). <p> Our result is the best among the three depicted in Table 3. Note that our method uses only two consecutive images to estimate the optical flow. The results of Fleet and Jepson's method for this example were obtained by using a 21-frame image sequence <ref> (Barron et al. 1994) </ref>. To achieve a fair comparison, we depict the reported results of Szeliski and Coughlan (1994) for the 2-frame image sequence. With incorporation of more frames of data, the results in Szeliski and Coughlan do however improve over those depicted in the table. <p> A more precise data constraint is obtained by using this selective combination scheme than the 25 one used by other gradient-based methods in literature. Flow estimates obtained using our method are more accurate than those obtained from techniques reported in literature <ref> (Barron et al. 1994) </ref>. This is evident from the experimental results. Our SSD-based regularization method uses the SSD measure as the data constraint in a regularization framework. The resulting energy function is neither quadratic nor convex.

Reference-contexts: However, it definitely requires more computational work to minimize the energy function. The total energy function in equation 21 is a nonlinear function with a large number of variables. We use the nonlinear conjugate gradient method <ref> (Gill et al. 1981) </ref> with a modified search direction to minimize this nonlinear energy function in equation 21. The nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm is very efficient in the unconstrained optimization of large-scale nonlinear functions (Gill et al. 1981). <p> We use the nonlinear conjugate gradient method <ref> (Gill et al. 1981) </ref> with a modified search direction to minimize this nonlinear energy function in equation 21. The nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm is very efficient in the unconstrained optimization of large-scale nonlinear functions (Gill et al. 1981). Although this algorithm can only find the local minima, we can obtain very accurate solution when the initial solution is close to the true solution. For example, small displacement between consecutive frames can be easily found when we start the nonlinear CG from zero initial values. <p> In addition, the scale space tracking scheme (Whitten 1993) can be employed to take care of large-displacement problems and to accelerate the convergence rate of the nonlinear CG algorithm. 13 3.1 Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Algorithm The nonlinear conjugate gradient method for minimizing general nonlinear func tions is outlined as follows <ref> (Gill et al. 1981) </ref>: 1. d 0 = r 0 = f 0 (u 0 ). 2.

Reference-contexts: To solve this linear system for optical flow estimation, we use the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm <ref> (Golub and Van Loan 1989) </ref> with an incomplete Cholesky preconditioner P (Meijerink and van der Vorst 1977, Elman 1986), given as follows. 1. Initialize u 0 ; compute r 0 = b Ku 0 ; k = 0. 2. <p> Thus, the solution to the auxiliary linear system Pz = r in the preconditioning step of the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm can be obtained via forward and backward substitutions very efficiently. Furthermore, we use the block version <ref> (Golub and Van Loan 1989) </ref> of the incomplete Cholesky factorization to take advantage of the 2fi2 block structure of the matrix K. The matrix K in equation 9 has diagonal blocks K s + E xx and K s + E yy , each of which is block tridiagonal.

Reference-contexts: unreliable flow constraint will degrade the accuracy of the optical flow estimation, we propose to disable this unreliable image flow constraint in the neighborhood of discontinuities and enable the robust contour-based flow constraint at the discontinuity locations in a regularization framework. 2.1 Incorporating the Contour-based Flow Constraint The contour-based methods <ref> (Hildreth 1984, Duncan and Chou 1992) </ref> compute the optical flow along the zero-crossing contours by using the following flow constraint equation S x (x; y; t)u (x; y; t) + S y (x; y; t)v (x; y; t) + S t (x; y; t) = 0 (4) where S (x; y;

Reference-contexts: These can be classified into gradient-based, correlation-based, energy-based, and phase-based methods (Barron et al. 1994). The gradient-based approach is dependent on the image flow constraint equation, which is derived from the brightness constancy assumption as well as the first-order Taylor series approximation <ref> (Horn and Schunk 1981) </ref>. Using the image flow constraint equation alone is not enough to compute the optical flow since each equation involves two different variables. Horn and Schunk (1981) introduced the membrane smoothness measure to constraint the flow field.

Reference-contexts: In the above equations, the values of the image function I 1 and its partial derivatives at (x i + u i ; y i + v i ) need to be computed using any interpolation technique. In our implementation, we used the interpolating spline under tension <ref> (Nielson and Franke 1984) </ref> to compute these values. 3.2 Modified Search Direction Scheme The nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm is a local search method which involves approximating the local landscape of the energy function by a quadratic function. 15 is small and thus the use of the gradient direction as the search

Reference-contexts: Since the smoothness constraint is invalid across the motion boundary, Nagel and Enkelmann (1986) proposed the "oriented smoothness" measure to suppress the smoothness constraint in 1 the direction perpendicular to boundaries. However, the smoothness across motion boundaries problem can be resolved by using the regularization with discontinuities <ref> (Terzopoulos 1986) </ref>. A major problem with the gradient-based approach is the unreliability of the image flow constraint equation in the areas whose local brightness function is highly nonlinear. These areas occur in scenes containing highly textured regions, motion discontinuities, or depth discontinuities.

Reference-contexts: For example, small displacement between consecutive frames can be easily found when we start the nonlinear CG from zero initial values. In fact, a very good initial solution can be obtained from the optical flow estimated in the previous frames. In addition, the scale space tracking scheme <ref> (Whitten 1993) </ref> can be employed to take care of large-displacement problems and to accelerate the convergence rate of the nonlinear CG algorithm. 13 3.1 Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Algorithm The nonlinear conjugate gradient method for minimizing general nonlinear func tions is outlined as follows (Gill et al. 1981): 1. d 0 = <p> To avoid being trapped in a local minimum during the minimization of a nonconvex energy function, we employ the scale-space tracking scheme <ref> (Whitten 1993) </ref>. The scale-space tracking is achieved by applying our algorithm on the smoothed image pair with the degree of smoothing being gradually reduced during the energy minimization.
