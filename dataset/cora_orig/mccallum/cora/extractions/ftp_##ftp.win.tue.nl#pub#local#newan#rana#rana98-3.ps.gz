Abstract: For a piston-driven flow of a Johnson-Segalman-Oldroyd(JSO)-fluid from a barrel through a cylindrical capillary, spurt accompanied by persistent oscillations in the pressure gradient is found for a bounded range of prescribed flow rates. The occurrence of the persistent oscillations is explained by a linearized stability analysis. Besides JSO, two other constitutive models are considered. The frequency of the persistent oscillations is determined both from the linearized stability theory as well as by means of a Fourier spectral analysis. Finally, the theory is validated by a qualitative comparison with experimental results.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In <ref> [1] </ref>, the first part of this paper, we investigated the capillary flow of a polymeric melt through a capillary. The polymeric melt was modelled as a JSO-fluid with one relaxation rate, and supplied with a Newtonian viscous term. <p> The flow is driven by a moving plunger, thus forcing the fluid to flow from a wide barrel into a narrow capillary or die. Compression in the barrel is taken into account. Numerical simulations of the transient flow are presented in <ref> [1] </ref>. These simulations show that for a bounded range of prescribed plunger speeds persistent oscillations in both the pressure as well as the volumetric flow rate occur. These oscillations are characteristic for a type of flow instability called spurt. <p> These oscillations are characteristic for a type of flow instability called spurt. Due to spurt, surface distortions of the extrudate occur, making the final product worthless. In <ref> [1] </ref>, only the JSO-model with one relaxation rate is considered. In this second part we present formulations for two more constitutive models, namely * a Kaye-Bernstein-Kearsly-Zapas (KBKZ)-model with one relaxation rate, supplied with a Newtonian viscous term; * a KBKZ-model with two relaxation rates, and without a Newtonian term. In [1], <p> <ref> [1] </ref>, only the JSO-model with one relaxation rate is considered. In this second part we present formulations for two more constitutive models, namely * a Kaye-Bernstein-Kearsly-Zapas (KBKZ)-model with one relaxation rate, supplied with a Newtonian viscous term; * a KBKZ-model with two relaxation rates, and without a Newtonian term. In [1], persistent oscillations are found by numerical means. In this part we use an analytical approach to show the existence of persistent oscillations. The method is a linearized stability analysis of the steady state solution. <p> Likewise, if the transient flow tends to a steady state, then correspondingly the steady state solution is found to be stable. Moreover, this linearized stability theory yields explicit numerical values for the frequencies of these oscillations. These frequencies can also be calculated from the numerical results of <ref> [1] </ref>, by means of a Fourier spectral analysis. The values found by these two methods are in good correspondence to each other. We will also show that analogue analyses of the two other constitutive models lead to equivalent results, and in fact all models can be identified by simple transformations. <p> We will show that the constitutive model used together with a no-slip boundary condition predicts at least qualitatively several aspects of spurt flow which are also found experimentally. 2 Mathematical formulation In Section 2 of <ref> [1] </ref> we have presented the mathematical formulation for the capillary flow of a JSO-fluid. <p> In this section we firstly recapitulate the main results of this formulation and after that we give the analogous formulations for a KBKZ-fluid and for a model with two relaxation rates. 2 2.1 JSO-model (recapitulation) The extrusion of a JSO-model is in <ref> [1] </ref> formulated in terms of 5 unknown field variables: the pressure P (t) in the barrel, the volumetric flow rate Q (t), the shear strain-rate w (r; t), the extra shear stress S (r; t), and the normal stress difference Z (r; t) (all dimensionless). <p> state shear strain-rate is a solution of (not necessarily unique) F (!) = "! + 1 + ! 2 = F (r) = 4rP = 2 2.2 KBKZ-model For a KBKZ-fluid the modelling of the compression flow in the barrel does not essentially differ from that for the JSO-model of <ref> [1] </ref>. More precisely, Eq.(2.19) of [1] does not change here. Also the basic equation for the capillary flow (i.e. the equation of motion) Eq.(2.34) remains valid here, as well as the definition of the volumetric flow rate, Eq.(2.35). Only the extra stress S (r; t) takes a different form. <p> solution of (not necessarily unique) F (!) = "! + 1 + ! 2 = F (r) = 4rP = 2 2.2 KBKZ-model For a KBKZ-fluid the modelling of the compression flow in the barrel does not essentially differ from that for the JSO-model of <ref> [1] </ref>. More precisely, Eq.(2.19) of [1] does not change here. Also the basic equation for the capillary flow (i.e. the equation of motion) Eq.(2.34) remains valid here, as well as the definition of the volumetric flow rate, Eq.(2.35). Only the extra stress S (r; t) takes a different form. <p> As in <ref> [1] </ref>, the velocity gradient, or shear strain-rate, w is introduced as w (r; t) = @r @ (r; t): (2.14) The boundary condition pertinent to (2.10) reads in dimensionless form v (1; t) = 0; t &gt; 0: (2.15) The model must be completed by the relations (see (2.1)) dP (t) <p> Here, the integral J is defined by J (!) = ! 0 1 + ! 2 o 2 do = 0 The steady state velocity gradient can be determined for each r 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> by solving ! = !(r) from (2.17). 2.3 Two relaxation rates In general, the characteristic response of molten polymers and polymer solutions to a deformation is described by means of a continuous spectrum of relaxation rates. <p> Subsection 2.2., only the steady state relation changes into J (!) = 2 where J is given by J (!) = 0 h (!(r)o )(e o + mfie fio )do: (2.25) 3 Stability analysis In this section we provide an explanation for the occurrence of persistent oscillations, as observed in <ref> [1] </ref>, by means of a linearized stability analysis of the steady state solution. It will turn out that the transient flow showing persistent oscillations corresponds precisely to the steady state solution being unstable. <p> It will turn out that the transient flow showing persistent oscillations corresponds precisely to the steady state solution being unstable. Likewise, if the transient flow tends to a steady state, then correspondingly the steady state solution is found to be stable. 6 3.1 JSO-model From the results of <ref> [1] </ref> we infer that the prescribed inlet flow rate Q i completely determines the transient flow behaviour. For Q i &gt; Q crit , the transient flow is found to either tend to a spurt steady state or to show persistent oscillations. <p> This velocity gradient is discontinuous with one jump from ! fl &lt; ! M + &gt; ! m at r = r fl (&lt; 1). The steady state values P and r fl satisfy the relation <ref> [1, (3.12)] </ref>, while !(r) is the smallest or the largest solution of the steady state equation F (!(r)) = 4rP , dependent on whether 0 r &lt; r fl or r fl &lt; r 1, respectively. If persistent oscillations occur, however, no steady state is attained. <p> In this table also the radial coordinate r fl at which the steady state velocity gradient !(r) is discontinuous, and the steady state pressure P = lim t!1 P (t) are listed; cf. Figures 7 and 8 in <ref> [1] </ref>. We observe that all eigenvalues have a negative real part (x 0 &lt; 0 and Re z 0 &lt; 0). Hence, the steady state solution is stable for each value of Q i . This stability result corresponds precisely to the result of [1], Sect.4, where we found that for <p> Figures 7 and 8 in <ref> [1] </ref>. We observe that all eigenvalues have a negative real part (x 0 &lt; 0 and Re z 0 &lt; 0). Hence, the steady state solution is stable for each value of Q i . This stability result corresponds precisely to the result of [1], Sect.4, where we found that for " = 0:02 and O = 1 the transient flow shows damped oscillations and tends to a steady state for each value of Q i . (Table 1) In Table 2 the computed eigenvalues z = x 0 and z = z 0 = <p> Hence, the steady state solution is stable for 0 Q i 0:35 and Q i 0:90, whereas the (fictitious) steady state solution is unstable for 0:40 Q 0:80. For comparison we quote the result of <ref> [1] </ref> in case " = 0:005, O = 1: The transient flow shows damped oscillations and tends to steady state for 0 Q i 0:35 and Q i 0:90, whereas persistent oscillations occur and no steady state is attained for 0:40 Q i 0:80. <p> In this way we find, for example, that Q m 0:36 and Q M 0:81, if " = 0:005 and O = 1. (Figure 1) The range R = (Q m ; Q M ), defined in <ref> [1] </ref> as the range of inlet flow rates Q i for which persistent oscillations occur depends on the parameters " and O. In Figure 1 the range R is plotted for " = 0:005, and O = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <p> Then (3.36) reduces to m (r)[1 + m with A (r; z) according to (3.24). Hence, we can identify the stability analysis for the two-mode and the single-mode model if we take m=fi = " . 4 Comparison between numerical and analytical results From the numerical results presented in <ref> [1] </ref>, we have inferred that a bounded range R of inlet flow rates Q i exists, for which persistent oscillations occur. The existence is supported by an in fact rather restricted number of numerical examples. <p> In this second part, however, the inference is corroborated by the results of the linearized stability theory, as presented in Table 2 and in Figures 1 and 2. For instance, we found here, precisely in correspondence to the result of <ref> [1, Sect.4] </ref>, that for " = 0:02 and O = 1 the transient flow shows damped oscillations and tends to a steady state for each value of Q i . <p> For a second comparison we quote the result of <ref> [1] </ref> in case " = 0:005, O = 1: The transient flow shows damped oscillations and tends to steady state for 0 Q i 0:35 and Q i 0:90, whereas persistent oscillations occur and no steady state is attained for 0:40 Q i 0:80. <p> In the final column of Table 5 we have listed the main frequency of the in <ref> [1] </ref> computed persistent oscillations, determined by means of a Fourier spectral analysis. For this, we consider the persistent oscillations in the pressure P (t). <p> For a survey of discrete Fourier transforms and FFT algorithms, see the book by Elliot and Rao [7]. (Figure 3) As an example we consider the persistent oscillations in the pressure P (t) and the volumetric flow rate Q (t), shown in Figures 10 and 12 of <ref> [1] </ref>, and occurring in the transient flow for " = 0:005, O = 1 and Q i = 0:6. <p> From the results presented in Figures 1 and 2 we conclude that * the range R becomes smaller with increasing O; * the range R becomes smaller with increasing "; * the range R is empty if O 6 or " &gt; 0:011. Our numerical computations in <ref> [1] </ref> already revealed the occurrence of persistent oscillations. Based on these numerical results, the frequency of the persistent oscillations has 16 been determined by means of a Fourier spectral analysis of the functions P (t) and Q (t), considered as time-dependent signals. <p> These observations are now compared with our theoretical results In <ref> [1] </ref>, Figures 7 or 13, it is seen that the flow curve is indeed S-shaped with a kink at Q = Q crit . The flow curve based on our numerical computations shows qualitative agreement with the flow curve experimentally found by El Kissi and Piau [10]. <p> In conclusion, our predictions about the dependence of the onset of persistent oscillations on the molecular weight M are in accordance with the observations of Lim and Schowalter [9] listed above. The flow curves in <ref> [1] </ref>, Figures 7 or 13, show a kink at the critical flow rate Q i = Q crit , independent of O; here Q crit = 1=6+O (") (see [1], Table 1). <p> The flow curves in <ref> [1] </ref>, Figures 7 or 13, show a kink at the critical flow rate Q i = Q crit , independent of O; here Q crit = 1=6+O (") (see [1], Table 1). According to the definition of O in (5.1) 2 , independence of O implies independence of 1=K and of L. Hence, the dimensional flow rate Q crit , given by (5.2), is independent of 1=K and of L. <p> Hence, the dimensional flow rate Q crit , given by (5.2), is independent of 1=K and of L. The independence of L is in accordance with the observation of El Kissi and Piau [10]. From <ref> [1] </ref>, Figure 11, it is clear that the amplitudes of the persistent oscillations in the pressure P and in the volumetric flow rate Q are constant in time, which is in accordance with the observation of Kalika and Denn [8]. <p> However, we expect that the influence of the contraction is only noticeable in the flow near the inlet of the capillary. Thus, for rather short capillaries the contraction should be taken into account; for longer capillaries the model described here and in <ref> [1] </ref> is adequate. In this section, we have validated our theoretical analyses by a qualitative comparison with experimental results. For a quantitative comparison, however, it will be necessary to incorporate sufficient relaxation rates in the constitutive equation, to render possible a satisfactory fit to experimental data.

Thus, we conclude that polymer compressibility in the barrel is not crucial for the onset of spurt flow, although it has some effect. This is in harmony with a comment of Lim and Schowalter [9] that melt compressibility in the reservoir is not important in their experiments.

The experiments on piston-driven flows by El Kissi and Piau [10], and Lim and Schowal-ter [9], give rise to the following observations: * The flow curve (i.e. the plot of steady state pressure gradient versus steady state flow rate) is S-shaped and shows a kink at a certain critical flow rate. * The critical flow rate at which the flow curve <p> To further validate our analysis, we also make a comparison with the following addi tional experimental observations: * The critical flow rate at which the flow curve shows a kink and beyond which spurt flow occurs, is independent of the length L of the capillary (El Kissi and Piau <ref> [10] </ref>). * The amplitude of the persistent oscillations is constant in time (Kalika and Denn [8]). * The span of the persistent oscillations goes through a maximum with increasing flow rate (Lim and Schowalter [9]). * The frequency of the persistent oscillations increases with increasing flow rate (Kalika and Denn [8], <p> The flow curve based on our numerical computations shows qualitative agreement with the flow curve experimentally found by El Kissi and Piau <ref> [10] </ref>. As found in [3, Chapter 3] for a piston-driven flow, the dimensionless critical flow rate Q crit equals Q crit = 1=6 + O ("), " ! 0. <p> Hence, Q crit is proportional to R 3 . Thus, the critical flow rate Q crit at which the flow curve shows a kink is larger for a wider capillary, which is in accordance with the observation of El Kissi and Piau <ref> [10] </ref>. From Malkus et al. [11, Table I], we learn that the parameter " decreases with increasing molecular weight M of the samples. <p> Hence, the dimensional flow rate Q crit , given by (5.2), is independent of 1=K and of L. The independence of L is in accordance with the observation of El Kissi and Piau <ref> [10] </ref>. From [1], Figure 11, it is clear that the amplitudes of the persistent oscillations in the pressure P and in the volumetric flow rate Q are constant in time, which is in accordance with the observation of Kalika and Denn [8].
