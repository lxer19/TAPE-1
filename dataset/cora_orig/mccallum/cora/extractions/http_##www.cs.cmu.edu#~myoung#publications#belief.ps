Reference-contexts: Specifically, where Perrault used the operator Obs x (y) to indicate that agent x was observing the action of agent y at some time, we will follow <ref> [1] </ref> and use DO x;t (Obs (DO y;t ff)).

Reference-contexts: The nonmonotonic approach to modeling communicative action was first attempted by Perrault <ref> [2] </ref> using Reiter's default logic [3]. A technical problem exists in the approach used by Perrault which results from the failure to include axioms affecting the default persistence of ignorance over time. <p> We then show that the properties of this new axiomatization match our intuition for this class of inter-agent communication. For completeness we provide a brief description of Perrault's axiomatization in the original default logic formalization. The reader should consult <ref> [2] </ref> for a full account of Perrault's work.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Speech Act Theory <ref> [4] </ref> focuses on modeling the change of mental state resulting from the performance of communicative action. This change in mental state typically involves the transfer of belief from one agent to another.

Reference-contexts: This logic is a variation of the logic defined in <ref> [5] </ref>, however we adopt a syntax similar to that used by Perrault in order to 5 make the comparison of this use of T I to Perrault's approach clearer. <p> Our preference criteria as stated provides no way to select between the two. We will use a chronological ordering technique similar to the logic of chronological ignorance <ref> [5] </ref> where the preferred model is the one in which belief is 7 established as late as possible 3 . <p> Logics of chronological ignorance must also place syntactic restrictions upon the sentences of their theories. In this paper we restrict our discussion to those sentences which conform to these restrictions. For a full explanation, see <ref> [5] </ref>. 8 content ' 4 , the hearer was listening to the speaker, and ' is consistent with the beliefs of the hearer. The process by which this transference of belief occurs is similar to that of Perrault's, using two main nonmonotonic rules.

In general, there will be many models for any particular set of sentences of T I.

Reference-contexts: For the formal definition of T I and a further discussion of its properties, including proofs of soundness and completeness, refer to <ref> [7] </ref>. Several different expressive levels are present in the logic T I. At the lowest level, there exists a set of basic tenseless propositions called proposition-types which are used to describe qualities about the domain of discourse of our theories. <p> Thus we have the following axioms for the modal operator B x;t : 2 For simplicity's sake we limit our discussion to a logic which is temporally point-based. The logic described in <ref> [7] </ref> associates proposition-types with intervals. 6 B x;t '; where ' is a tautology (13) B x;t ' ^ B x;t (' ) B x;t (14) :B x;t ' B x;t :B x;t ' (16) We also have the rules of inference modus ponens and generalization. 3.2 Nonmonotonic Reasoning in This
