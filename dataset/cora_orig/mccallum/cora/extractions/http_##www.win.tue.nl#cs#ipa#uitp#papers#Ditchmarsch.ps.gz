Abstract: University Proof Tutor, and Symlog. Other programs are briefly mentioned. Japes interface is visually most appealing and least biased towards forward or backward reasoning. Hyperproofs natural deduction assistant suits proof checking very well. Symlogs help facilities are remarkable. Interface design for full-fledged theorem provers
