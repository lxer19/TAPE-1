Reference-contexts: Introduction Digital video has received enormous attention in recent years because of its superior quality. With the standardization of compression algorithms <ref> [1, 2] </ref> and the rapid development of hardware technologies, its applications have become part of our daily experiences. Some of the stand-alone applications, such as video CD and CD-i movie, even entered massive market production phase [3]. <p> Therefore, for most digital video applications, compression techniques have to be employed. Currently two compression standards, JPEG (Joint Photographic Expert Group) and MPEG (Motion Picture Expert Group), are widely used. JPEG <ref> [1] </ref> is basically an image compression technique. It makes use of the co-relations among pixels inside each frame to reduce redundant information and thus achieve intra-frame compression. MPEG [2] is designed specifically for digital videos. <p> addition, the authors claim the optimality of their algorithm based on the notion of majorization [45] which is defined as follows: 42 Definition 3 (Majorization) Given n-dimensional real vectors X = [x 1 ; ::::; x n ] and Y = [y 1 ; :::; y n ], let x <ref> [1] </ref> , ..., x [n] and y [1] , ..., y [n] denote the non-increasing orderings of X and Y respectively. <p> their algorithm based on the notion of majorization [45] which is defined as follows: 42 Definition 3 (Majorization) Given n-dimensional real vectors X = [x 1 ; ::::; x n ] and Y = [y 1 ; :::; y n ], let x <ref> [1] </ref> , ..., x [n] and y [1] , ..., y [n] denote the non-increasing orderings of X and Y respectively.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1.1 shows such variations in a short MPEG-I video clip. If such video sequences are transmitted based on their embedded timing requirements, the resulting traffic would be very bursty, i.e. bit rate would be highly variable. It has been shown in <ref> [8] </ref> that both JPEG and MPEG videos have long-term burstiness while MPEG videos also have short-term burstiness. We call such videos variable bit rate (VBR) videos. For a VBR video, the ratio between its peak rate and average rate 3 reflects to some degree the burstiness of the video. <p> In the case of peak rate reservation, this wastage is reflected by the peak to average ratio which can be quite large for very bursty traffic <ref> [8] </ref>. And since reservation is a key factor in network service pricing, the application user must pay for the over reserved bandwidth. This clearly is not desirable.

In such a model, a bursty traffic is composed of a sequence of busy (on) and idle (off) periods. Whereas nothing is transmitted during each off period, packets (cells) are transmitted at a constant rate in all on period.

Reference-contexts: Providing deterministic guarantee to such bursty traffic would inevitably result in resource over-reservation in the network. In the extreme case where 5 resources are reserved based on the peak rate, the network utilization can be considerably affected by such bursty traffic <ref> [16] </ref>. Even with more accurate bandwidth reservation strategies, bandwidth utilization usually is still low compared to CBR videos. It has been shown that burstier traffic generally results in lower network utilization [21].

Reference-contexts: Even with more accurate bandwidth reservation strategies, bandwidth utilization usually is still low compared to CBR videos. It has been shown that burstier traffic generally results in lower network utilization <ref> [21] </ref>. In a commercial network where pricing is directly related to bandwidth reservation, such a low utilization is highly undesirable. This problem can be alleviated by buffering video data either at the server (e.g. live video) or at the client (e.g. video on-demand). <p> As an important smoothness parameter, rate change frequency affects both video server scheduling and network resource negotiation. In particular, minimizing the number of rate changes in video traffic is crucial for improving network performance under certain type of network service models. In fact, two service models - CBR <ref> [21] </ref> and RCBR (Renegotiated CBR)[46] were discussed in [40] to show the effectiveness of their smoothing method. CBR model is essentially a peak rate reservation scheme.

Reference-contexts: The receive valve on the client end ideally should receive information at the same rate as the transmit valve plus a small transit latency. The receive rate may match the transmit rate closely by adequate congestion control methods such as by allocating buffer and bandwidth resources <ref> [24] </ref> within the network. The video display valve empties data from the client buffer at a rate to maintain a smooth play back. Thresholds are set for the server cache, the network buffer, and the client buffer.

Reference-contexts: In the case of repeated underflow, however, the client must be more careful since this can also result from a congested network. Increasing the transmission rate would be detrimental. This condition can be detected from the network buffer level as described earlier. Congestion is then alleviated by media scaling <ref> [25, 26] </ref> such as lowering the frame rate for the video and subsequently the transmission rate. Client-controlled buffering takes into account the fact that the client has immediate control over the buffer and better knowledge about the condition of the end-to-end connection.

Reference-contexts: Based on these algorithms, we shall describe solutions for the above two problems and present algorithms for other types of traffic smoothing problems. 1.5 Related work Buffering in video transmission has been a topic studied by many researchers. In <ref> [27] </ref>, Ramanathan and Rangan proposed a feedback technique for intra-media and inter-media synchronization for client-server media retrieval. The server determines buffer conditions based on feedback messages from the client and the estimation of network delay. Deadlines for video frame transmissions are then calculated for transmission scheduling.

Reference-contexts: In a previous paper [22], we introduced a client-server synchronization method in displaying stored VBR video over an ATM network. A client buffer is employed and several thresholds together with transmission rates are used to prevent buffer overflow and underflow. In <ref> [28] </ref>, Reininger and Hui presented a feedback technique for real-time VBR video transmission over ATM network. Quantization parameters are dynamically adjusted based on such feedbacks to adapt to congestion in the network.

Reference-contexts: Quantization parameters are dynamically adjusted based on such feedbacks to adapt to congestion in the network. Since live video is their subject of study, buffering is done at the server side and heuristic methods are used. In <ref> [29] </ref>, Lam et. al. showed the effectiveness of a predictive smoothing strategy for real-time video based on the structural characteristic of MPEG videos. But the author did not give an exact smoothness criterion and the corresponding smoothness upperbound. <p> Thus in practice, our algorithms can not be applied to generate smoothing functions for real-time video. One way to get around this problem is to use a similar predictive method as in <ref> [29] </ref>. This is based on the observation that consecutive video frames are highly correlated. Especially in the case of MPEG videos, a regular frame pattern is present. We shall explore such possibilities in our future research. <p> Checking some specific numbers, we can find out that there are about 250 and 130 rate changes with 0.5 second and 1 second delays respectively. These numbers are far lower than those mentioned in <ref> [29] </ref> where the authors reported rate change about every group of pictures (12 frames in our case) using their predictive algorithm.

Reference-contexts: But the author did not give an exact smoothness criterion and the corresponding smoothness upperbound. We will show in this thesis that such an upperbound can be easily given as a special case of our paradigm. Goyal et. al. discussed a reliable network protocol in <ref> [30] </ref>. For VBR videos, traffic smoothing is only done when necessary, thus delay can be reduced. However, such a protocol can not provide deterministic guarantees to video services and requires protocol changes in ATM switches.

Reference-contexts: As an important issue in network control, traffic smoothing (shaping) has received great attentions in recent years. Cruz established a general leaky bucket model for admission control and traffic shaping in <ref> [31] </ref>. This model uses a pair of parameters (; ) to constrain a source traffic such that during any interval t, the number of bits transmitted by the source is no more than + t.

Reference-contexts: These models use a family of rate-interval pairs based on the fact that over a longer interval,a source may be bounded by a rate closer to its long-term average rate. A series of buckets corresponding to these rates are then employed for traffic shaping. In <ref> [34] </ref>, Knightly and Rossaro studied the relationship between server side smoothing and delay for VBR videos using the D-BIND model. In [35], Rigolo and Fratta introduced a different traffic 12 shaping mechanism where a single sliding window together with a rate controlled server are used for traffic regulation.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, different applications have different delay requirements and buffer capacities, network smoothing is thus necessary in some cases to further smooth out traffics output by end-to-end smoothing. Part of the research presented in this thesis bears direct relationship to the work done by McManus and Ross <ref> [38, 39] </ref>. They studied buffer requirements for constant rate and piece-wise constant rate transmissions for VBR videos. We focus our study in the context of traffic smoothing instead. In our opinion, such a perspective is more suitable for practical applications. <p> In order to reduce the complexity, we need to find a value for F as small as possible. Again, we can use a fast heuristic algorithm to find an upper bound on the minimum memory requirement. One such algorithm is suggested in <ref> [38] </ref>. The basic idea of the algorithm is to use the average rate R ave = N P f i N of the whole video sequence as the transmission rate.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, different applications have different delay requirements and buffer capacities, network smoothing is thus necessary in some cases to further smooth out traffics output by end-to-end smoothing. Part of the research presented in this thesis bears direct relationship to the work done by McManus and Ross <ref> [38, 39] </ref>. They studied buffer requirements for constant rate and piece-wise constant rate transmissions for VBR videos. We focus our study in the context of traffic smoothing instead. In our opinion, such a perspective is more suitable for practical applications. <p> We focus our study in the context of traffic smoothing instead. In our opinion, such a perspective is more suitable for practical applications. This is because client side buffers are usually fixed while the video sequences always change in different applications. The algorithm presented in <ref> [39] </ref> has a very high complexity and is not completely accurate (although the accuracy can be fairly good at the cost of extreme time and space complexities).

Reference-contexts: the algorithm presented in this thesis can be easily extended to solve the buffer requirement problem, it is unlikely that their algorithm can be adapted to solve the smoothing problem given in this thesis. 13 In another closely related work, Salehi, et. al. proposed a VBR video traffic smoothing method <ref> [40] </ref> similar to the sliding-stretching algorithm presented in chapter 2. The authors proved its optimality in rate variability reduction based on the notion of "majorization". <p> based on the relationship among the two constraint points and the stretching end point, e.g. if SE l 2 V (t), then the first constraint point must be a vertex of V (t) and the second constraint point must be a vertex of V B (t). 2.1.7 Algorithm comparison In <ref> [40] </ref>, Salehi et. al. presented a similar VBR video smoothing technique called "optimal smoothing". Unlike the sliding-stretching algorithm, their algorithm does not include sliding steps. Instead, a constraint point is chosen as the new starting point in each iteration and its correpsonding stretching line is computed. <p> In fact, a majorization comparison is carried out on a frame by frame basis in <ref> [40] </ref>. This means that the optimality claim of [40] is only valid for traffic patterns which start with the same initial delay and end at the same time. <p> In fact, a majorization comparison is carried out on a frame by frame basis in <ref> [40] </ref>. This means that the optimality claim of [40] is only valid for traffic patterns which start with the same initial delay and end at the same time. <p> It does not hold for traffic generated by minimum polyline smoothing for the following reasons: * Because of the "sliding" steps, minimum polyline smoothing supports the notion of "delay bound" whereas the optimal smoothing of <ref> [40] </ref> assumes a fixed delay. * Unlike optimal smoothing which only allows rate changes at frame boundaries (i fl ; 0 i &lt; N ), the rate may change at any time during transmission in minimum polyline smoothing. * In optimal smoothing, transmission can only end at the last vertex of <p> In particular, minimizing the number of rate changes in video traffic is crucial for improving network performance under certain type of network service models. In fact, two service models - CBR [21] and RCBR (Renegotiated CBR)[46] were discussed in <ref> [40] </ref> to show the effectiveness of their smoothing method. CBR model is essentially a peak rate reservation scheme. Given that both optimal smoothing and minimum polyline smoothing generate traffic with a minimum peak rate, these two smoothing methods would result in same resource utilization with the CBR service model. <p> Optimal smoothing In chapter 2, we compared minimum polyline smoothing with a similar smoothing method called optimal smoothing <ref> [40] </ref>. For a given constraint region G V;B , both smoothing methods generate traffic with the lowest peak rate among all feasible traffic inside G V;B .

Reference-contexts: Based on the experimental results on some MPEG-I videos, our algorithm results in substantially less rate changes and similar (small buffer) or much smaller (large buffer) rate variability. This result is obviously advantageous both in terms of server scheduling and network resource negotiation. In <ref> [41] </ref>, Feng et. al. proposed a similar algorithm as the minimum polyline smoothing algorithm presented in chapter 2. However, the authors did not give a rigorous proof of the properties of the algorithm and did not consider many details of the algorithm. <p> For example, the authors did not show how delay constraints can be incorporated into the algorithm and how the algorithm can be efficiently implemented. Further, we thoroughly studied the fundamental relationship among client buffer size, delay bound and traffic smoothness using the minimum polyline smoothing algorithm while <ref> [41] </ref> only examined one aspect of this relationship. The problem of finding a polyline with the minimum number of turning points in a simple polygon has been known in the area of computational geometry as the link distance problem.

Reference-contexts: The sliding-stretching algorithm in this thesis was designed prior to becoming aware of this algorithm and in a quite different way due to the special requirement in traffic smoothing. Nevertheless, a key component of the visibility algorithm building the shortest Euclidean path tree for a given source <ref> [43] </ref> can be also 14 applied to the sliding-stretching algorithm. <p> These costs include the time and space spent on triangulating the polygon, searching the edges of each triangle to find a window and storing the entire window tree. A key component of the window tree technique is an algorithm proposed by Guibas et. al. in <ref> [43] </ref>. This algorithm finds the shortest Euclidean path tree for a given source in a simple polygon in linear time. <p> This improvement results in a linear time sliding-stretching algorithm with smaller time and space complexity constants compared to the adaptation of the window tree algorithm. We first introduce some notions used in <ref> [43] </ref> and then present one of the major results of [43] which will help us find the stretching line of a given sliding line. <p> This improvement results in a linear time sliding-stretching algorithm with smaller time and space complexity constants compared to the adaptation of the window tree algorithm.
