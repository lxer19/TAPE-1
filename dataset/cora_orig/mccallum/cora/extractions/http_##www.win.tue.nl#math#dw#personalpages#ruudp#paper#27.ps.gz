Abstract: Based on the notion of an order function we construct and determine the parameters of a class of error-correcting evaluation codes. This class includes the one-point algebraic geometry codes as well as the generalized Reed-Muller codes, and the parameters are determined without using heavy machinery from algebraic geometry.

Reference-contexts: D. Goppa <ref> [1] </ref> showed that it is possible to determine the parameters of such codes if the points are chosen on an algebraic curve and the functions are from a certain space associated with the curve. The proof of this uses some heavy machinery from algebraic geometry, in particular the Riemann-Roch Theorem.
