Reference-contexts: The first is the inclusion of the 3-term recursion relation familiar from the theory of conjugate gradients in the Davidson eigenvector method <ref> [1] </ref> for large matrices (dimension over 10 6 ) [2, 3, 4, 5]. The primary goal of this is to save storage space which is a bottleneck in full CI or large multi-reference CI calculations [6].

The second topic is the application of pseudodiagonalization, familiar from semiempirical theory [7] in large-scale SCF (and DFT) calculations.

Reference-contexts: Thus the O (N 3 ) matrix diagonalization becomes the rate-determining step for large calculations. Shepard <ref> [8] </ref> has recently formulated a method, based on Bacskay's second order SCF theory, which avoids the diagonalization bottleneck. I will summarize our experience with pseudodiagonalization, based on first-order SCF theory. This method was implemented for the parallel calculation of NMR chemical shifts. [9]
