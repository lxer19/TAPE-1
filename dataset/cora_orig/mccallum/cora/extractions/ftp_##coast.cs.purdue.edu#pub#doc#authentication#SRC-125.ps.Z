Reference-contexts: Possible sorts of bad behavior are disclosure of keys and forgery of messages. Therefore, if this assumption is made in a particular case then it should be explicit. 2 Example 11.5 An access control list (ACL) is a statement of trust <ref> [1] </ref>: if principal A appears on the ACL for an operation then A is trusted when it says that the operation should be performed (that is, when it makes a request). It can be a complex matter to determine whether the statement of trust that the ACL represents is appropriate.

Reference-contexts: The effect of the request at time T may benefit C, for example if C is using A's workstation at time T . Bellovin and Merritt have discussed further problems in the use of times-tamps in Kerberos <ref> [2] </ref>. 2 6.2 What is fresh: use vs. generation Roughly, a bit-pattern is fresh if any message that contains it must be recent. Clearly, it does not suffice that the bit-pattern participate in one recent message, if it may also participate in old ones.

Reference-contexts: precise comparison of informal ideas is difficult, we also find an affinity with Boyd and Mao's proposal that protocols should be robust in the sense that "authentication of any message in the protocol depends only on information contained in the message itself or already in the possession of the recipient" <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We illustrate the principles with examples. In order to demonstrate the actual applicability of our guidelines, we draw these examples from the literature. Some of the oddities and errors that we analyze have been documented previously (in particular, in <ref> [4] </ref>). Other examples are new: protocols by Denning and Sacco [6], Lu and Sundareshan [12], Varadharajan, Allen, and Black [29], and Woo and Lam [32]. We believe they are all instructive. <p> In particular, if any of P , S, A, B, or K are left to be inferred from context, it may be possible for one message to be used deceitfully in place of another. This principle is not completely original. In <ref> [4] </ref>, we recommend the use of a logical notation in generating and describing protocols|essentially proposing a method to follow the principle. Establishing the correspondence between the logical protocol and its concrete implementation can be a simple matter of parsing, as for example in [31, Section 4.3.2]. <p> For example, if someone believes that choosing session keys should be done by a suitably trusted server rather than by one of the participants in a session, then he will not wish to use a protocol such as the Wide-mouthed-frog protocol <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> The protocols are intended for signed, secure communication between two principals, assuming that each knows the public key of the other. The CCITT proposal has problems. We discuss one problem described in <ref> [4] </ref>; it appears already in the one-message protocol: Message 1 A ! B : A; fT a ; N a ; B; X a ; fY a g K b g K 1 a Here, T a is a timestamps, N a is a nonce (not used), and X a and <p> A; Bg K bs Message 3 S ! B : M; fN a ; K ab g K as ; fN b ; K ab g K bs Message 4 B ! A : M; fN a ; K ab g K as This is the first protocol analyzed in <ref> [4] </ref>. Perhaps because of our relative inexperience, we were rather bold in the idealization of this protocol|in assigning meanings to these messages. As a consequence, we suggested in passing that the encryption of N b in Message 2 is unnecessary.

Reference-contexts: Failure to follow this principle can lead to errors, as in the next example. Example 5.1 The CCITT X.509 standard contains a set of three protocols using between one and three messages <ref> [5] </ref>. The protocols are intended for signed, secure communication between two principals, assuming that each knows the public key of the other. The CCITT proposal has problems.

Reference-contexts: We illustrate the principles with examples. In order to demonstrate the actual applicability of our guidelines, we draw these examples from the literature. Some of the oddities and errors that we analyze have been documented previously (in particular, in [4]). Other examples are new: protocols by Denning and Sacco <ref> [6] </ref>, Lu and Sundareshan [12], Varadharajan, Allen, and Black [29], and Woo and Lam [32]. We believe they are all instructive. Generally, we pick examples from the authentication literature, but the principles are applicable elsewhere, for example to electronic-cash protocols (e.g., [15]). <p> However, when this information cannot be deduced, its omission is a blunder with serious consequences. The principle is obvious and simple, yet it is commonly ignored. We give several examples of fairly different natures. Example 3.1 In <ref> [6, p. 535] </ref>, Denning and Sacco propose a protocol for key exchange based on an asymmetric cryptosystem. In the first two messages 5 of this protocol, A obtains certificates CA and CB that connect A and B with their public keys K a and K b , respectively. <p> Encryption is not synonymous with security, and its improper use can lead to errors. Example 4.1 The Kerberos protocol [16] is based on the original Needham-Schroeder protocol [20], but makes use of timestamps as nonces in order to remove flaws demonstrated by Denning and Sacco <ref> [6] </ref> and in order to reduce the total number of messages required. Like the Needham-Schroeder protocol on which it is based, the Kerberos protocol relies on symmetric-key 9 cryptography. <p> They do not (and in fact were not intended to) convince B that K ab is fresh, and it was pointed out by Denning and Sacco that compromise of a session key could allow an intruder to deceive B <ref> [6] </ref>. Once the importance of freshness of K ab is recognized, a solution may be found by using timestamps, as suggested by Denning and Sacco.

Reference-contexts: We focus on traditional cryptography, and on protocols of the sort commonly implemented with the DES [18] and the RSA [26] algorithms. In particular, we do not consider the subtleties of interactive schemes for signatures (e.g, <ref> [7] </ref>). Moreover, we do not discuss the choice of cryptographic mechanisms with adequate protection properties, the correct implementation of cryptographic primitives, or their appropriate use; these subjects are discussed elsewhere (e.g., [30, 17]). Throughout, we concentrate on the simple principles with the largest potential applicability and payoff.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the time maintenance mecha nism everywhere becomes part of the trusted computing base. Example 8.1 Timestamps have received abundant attention in the authentication literature. Gong, in particular, has described problems arising from the use of incorrect timestamps <ref> [8] </ref>. Therefore, we keep this example brief, summarizing Gong's example for the Kerberos system. In Kerberos, as elsewhere, a principal with a slow clock is exposed to all sorts of difficulties, since the principal may mistake expired certificates for current ones.

Reference-contexts: It does provide a guarantee: when B receives the first part of Message 3, it knows that A must have extracted it from Message 2, and hence that A must have looked at Message 2. (Heintze and Tygar <ref> [9] </ref> discuss a similar use of encryption in a variant of the Otway-Rees protocol [23].) This interpretation of encryption is sound, but slightly unusual, and probably not what the protocol designers had in mind. * In the second part of Message 3, encryption is used for an entirely different purpose: A

Reference-contexts: by several means, the simplest of which is to sign the secret data before it is encrypted for privacy. 2 A particular case of the principle concerns hash functions: Example 5.2 It is common to use hash functions in order to save on encryption with asymmetric-key systems (see for example <ref> [25, 10] </ref>). In particular, A can send a signed, confidential message to B as follows: Message 1 A ! B : fXg K b ; fH (X)g K 1 a where H is a one-way hash function.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Cryptographic protocols, as used in distributed systems for authentication and related purposes, are prone to design errors of every kind. Over time, various formalisms have been proposed for investigating and analyzing protocols to see whether they contain blunders. (Liebl's bibliography <ref> [11] </ref> includes references to protocols and formalisms.) Although sometimes useful, these formalisms do not of themselves suggest design rules; they are not directly beneficial in preventing trouble. We present principles for the design of cryptographic protocols. The principles are not necessary for correctness, nor are they sufficient.

B : fA; N b g K bs A further change is discussed in Example 6.2. 2 Example 3.3 A more dramatic example is provided by the basic Internet protocol of Lu and Sundareshan <ref> [12, pp. 1016-1017] </ref>. This protocol is rather complicated for a detailed description. Its intent is to allow two principals A and B to obtain a session key, with the mediation of local servers and gateways. On the other hand, the fundamental flaw of the protocol is rather simple.

Reference-contexts: One immediately sees that neither A nor B ever receives a message that contains the other's name. Obviously, this opens the door for confusions between different connections. It also allows some easy attacks to defeat the protocol. After we contacted them, the authors published a correction <ref> [13] </ref>, where names appear in messages explicitly. 2 5 Encryption The next group of principles and examples concern encryption.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps because of our relative inexperience, we were rather bold in the idealization of this protocol|in assigning meanings to these messages. As a consequence, we suggested in passing that the encryption of N b in Message 2 is unnecessary. As Mao and Boyd have since explained in detail <ref> [14] </ref>, the encryption of N a and N b is essential: because N a and N b are bound with the names A and B by encryption in Messages 1 and 2, they can serve as secure references to A and B in Messages 3 and 4.

Reference-contexts: They are generally related to Principle 1, since they concern what encryption means and what it does not mean. 5.1 The uses of encryption As the examples below illustrate, encryption is used for a variety of purposes in the present context <ref> [19] </ref>. * Encryption is sometimes used for the preservation of confidentiality. In such cases it is assumed that only intended recipients know the key needed to recover a message.

Reference-contexts: Once the importance of freshness of K ab is recognized, a solution may be found by using timestamps, as suggested by Denning and Sacco. In another solution, described in <ref> [21] </ref>, B sends a nonce to S, and then S includes it in its certificate. 2 Example 9.2 In [29], Varadharajan, Allen, and Black present several protocols for delegation in distributed systems. We take as an example the one for delegation in a Kerberos environment [29, p. 273].

Reference-contexts: A similar exchange arises in the context of Kerberos. Neuman and Stubblebine suggest using Kerberos itself to obtain the time from a time server <ref> [22] </ref>. The quantity used as a nonce is roughly predictable: it is an incorrect timestamp; since it is encrypted, we expect no difficulties. 2 Freshness can also be proved by the use of timestamps. Timestamps are appealing because they seem easier to use than random numbers.

Whence we propose: Principle 6 Be clear what properties you are assuming about nonces. What may do for ensuring temporal succession may not do for ensuring association|and perhaps association is best established by other means. Example 6.1 In <ref> [23] </ref>, Otway and Rees describe the following protocol.

Reference-contexts: After this exchange, A accepts T s as the current time if the response arrived reasonably soon after the challenge. Reiter exploits random nonces roughly in this manner <ref> [24] </ref>. This protocol would not work if N a were predictable.

Reference-contexts: Some of the oddities and errors that we analyze have been documented previously (in particular, in [4]). Other examples are new: protocols by Denning and Sacco [6], Lu and Sundareshan [12], Varadharajan, Allen, and Black [29], and Woo and Lam <ref> [32] </ref>. We believe they are all instructive. Generally, we pick examples from the authentication literature, but the principles are applicable elsewhere, for example to electronic-cash protocols (e.g., [15]). We focus on traditional cryptography, and on protocols of the sort commonly implemented with the DES [18] and the RSA [26] algorithms. <p> It is important that this format must not be used for anything else; we return to this point in Section 7. 2 6 Example 3.2 In <ref> [32, pp. 42-43] </ref>, Woo and Lam present an authentication protocol based on symmetric-key cryptography.

Reference-contexts: An operational variant on this theme appears in the work of Woo and Lam, who say that a protocol is a full information protocol if "its initiator and responder always include in their outgoing encrypted messages all the information they have gathered" <ref> [33] </ref>. 2.2 Appropriate action For a message to be acted upon, it does not suffice that the message be understood; a variety of other conditions have to hold too. <p> The existence of this attack demonstrates that the messages in the protocol are not sufficiently explicit about the identity of the principals in question. (After we contacted them, Woo and Lam came to the same conclusion <ref> [33] </ref>.) Reasoning as in Example 3.1, we may remove the flaw, by changing the last message of the protocol to Message 5 S ! B : fA; N b g K bs A further change is discussed in Example 6.2. 2 Example 3.3 A more dramatic example is provided by the

Reference-contexts: The idea of trust is pervasive and a little elusive. A careful classification of types of trust is given in <ref> [34] </ref> and is taken further by Klein in her doctoral thesis. There are questions both of practice and philosophy to do with trust relations|for example whether they are transitive or not|which it would not be appropriate to pursue here.
