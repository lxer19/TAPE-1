Abstract: Applications with real-time data transport requirements fall into two categories: those which require transmission of data units at regular intervals, which we call continuous media (CM) clients, e.g. video conferencing, voice communication, high-quality digital sound; and those which generate data for transmission at relatively arbitrary times, which we call real-time message-oriented clients. Because CM clients are better able to characterize their future behavior than message-oriented clients, a data transport service dedicated for CM clients can use this a priori knowledge to more accurately predict their future resource demands. Therefore, a separate transport service can potentially provide a more cost-effective service along with additional functionality to support CM clients. The design of such a data transport service for CM clients and its underlying protocol (within the BLANCA gigabit testbed project) will be presented in this document. This service provides unreliable, in-sequence transfer (simplex, periodic) of so-called stream data units (STDUs) between a sending and a receiving client, with performance guarantees on loss, delay, and throughput. fl This research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Cooperative Agreement NCR-8919038 with the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, by AT&T Bell Laboratories, Hitachi, Ltd., Hitachi America, Ltd., Pacific Bell, the University of California under a MICRO grant, and the International Computer Science Institute.

Reference: 1. <author> Video channel: </author> <title> This channel will be used for transmitting either video of the instructor in lecture mode or the moving video in movie mode. This channel is the same as the video-conferencing example above except that in movie mode the image is four times bigger, will change at 30 frames per second, and may experience up to one scene change per two seconds. This channel must be synchronized with the audio and/or images on the other channel. </title>

Reference: 3. <author> Notepad/Image Channel: </author> <title> This channel is exactly as described in the previous example. In lecture mode, it will carry either a notepad (i.e. ``blackboard'') of color graphics, or a still image that takes about 10 seconds to change. In movie mode, it will carry two streams of subtitles for the movie. This channel must be synchronized with the video channel. </title>


Reference: 2. <author> Audio channels: </author> <title> The audio channels will be like voice channels, except as noted above STDU max = 200 bytes CONST_SIZE = TRUE CONST_NUM = TRUE T = 12.5 ms N max input parameter is ignored S max = 200 bytes S avg = 200 bytes I avg = 1 S min = 200 bytes S Sslack = STDU max S max hhhhhhhhh = 1 D stream = 300 ms S err = 200 bytes W err = 99% (lose 1 packet per period) REPLACE = FALSE Dummy = null (do not replace lost data) </title>
Reference: 3. <author> Notepad/Image Channel: </author> <title> STDU max = 1 byte CONST_SIZE = TRUE CONST_NUM = FALSE T = 0.5 sec N max input parameter is ignored - 14 - S max = 90 KB S avg = 13 KB I avg = 20 periods S min = 0 S Sslack = 90 KB D stream = 300 ms (video stream) S err = 1300 bytes W err = 95% REPLACE = TRUE Dummy = all 0's </title>
