Abstract: UPMAIL Technical Report No. 126 June 4, 1996 ISSN 1100-0686 Abstract Recently it was proved that the problem of simultaneous rigid E-unification (SREU) is undecidable. Here we perform an in-depth investigation of this matter and obtain that one can use SREU to uniformly represent any recursively enumerable set. From the exact form of this representation follows that SREU is undecidable already for 6 rigid equations with ground left hand sides and 2 variables. There is a close correspondence between solvability of SREU problems and provability of the corresponding formulas in intuitionistic first order logic with equality. Due to this correspondence we obtain a new (uniform) representation of the recursively enumerable sets in intuitionistic first order logic with equality with one binary function symbol and a countable set of constants. From this result follows the undecidability of the 99-fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality. This is an improvement of a recent result regarding the undecidability of the 9 fl -fragment in general.

The different proofs reflect the undecidable nature of SREU more or less directly. The most transparent proof is probably by reduction of second order unification, which shows how close these problems really are to each other. <p> The least transparent proof, revealing more or less completely the undecidable nature of SREU, is ofcourse the one preseted above. 5.3.1 Reduction of Monadic Semi-unification The first proof of the udecidability of SREU <ref> [9] </ref> was by reduction of the monadic semi-unification to SREU.

Reference-contexts: It took 70 years before Matiyasevic proved the problem to be undecidable [29].

As the third undecidability proof of SREU [10], Degtyarev and Voronkov showed how to reduce Hilberts 10'th to SREU. The proof is quite short and the key argument <ref> [10, Lemma 6] </ref> lies in representing multiplication with a system of rigid equations. 1 It is not known if this problem is decidable. 21 The idea is to represent a multiplication of k and l as a list D of pairs, such that the first pair in D is (k 0 <p> Furthermore, the construction of is performed uniformly in the index of the r. e. set in question. We obtain that the 99-fragment of intuitionistic logic is undecidable. This is an improvement of the undecidability result of the 9 fl -fragment in general shown recently by Degtyarev and Voronkov <ref> [10, Theorem 10] </ref> (or [11, Theorem 3]). A closely related problem is the skeleton instantiation problem, i.e., the problem of existence of a derivation with a given skeleton. <p> This requires a slightly different formulation of Theorem 4.2.1.

Reference-contexts: The main result here is Theorem 6.1.1. (It is actually a simple corollary of Theorem 5.2.1.) In particular, the undecidability of the 99-fragment of intuitionistic logic follows from it, this is an improvement of the recent result regarding the undecidability of the 9 fl -fragment in general <ref> [11] </ref>. In Chapter 7 we summerize the current status and state some open problems regarding decidability questions about SREU. 2 Chapter 2 Preliminaries Here we explain the notational conventions of this this report and give the main definitions concerning SREU. <p> A -unification problem is then reduced to SREU. This reduction is rather technical, and it does not really reveal the nature of SREU that makes it undecidable. 5.3.2 Reduction of Second Order Unification The second proof of the undecidability of SREU by Degtyarev and Voronkov <ref> [8, 11] </ref>, and probably the most straightforward one, is by reducing second order unification to SREU. The undecidability of second order unification was proved by Goldfarb [18]. A second order unification problem is the problem of deciding if a finite set S of second order equations is unifiable. <p> For to be a unifier for s = t it must be the case that xfs 1 =w 1 ; : : : ; s m =w m g coincides with t. The set S is reduced to the following system of rigid equations <ref> [11, Theorem 1] </ref>. (Roughly speaking.) The first case is simply reduced to the rigid equation ` 8 t = s. The second case is reduced to two rigid equations. <p> Clearly, this is just a slight reformulation of the original problem, and one readily proves that S has a unifier if and only if this system of rigid equations is solvable <ref> [11, Lemma 5] </ref>. 5.3.3 Reduction of Hilberts 10'th In 1900 David Hilbert presented a list of 23 problems at a mathematics conference in Paris. The 10'th problem was, if there exists an algorithm that for each diophantine equation can decide whether it has an integer solution or not. <p> We obtain that the 99-fragment of intuitionistic logic is undecidable. This is an improvement of the undecidability result of the 9 fl -fragment in general shown recently by Degtyarev and Voronkov [10, Theorem 10] (or <ref> [11, Theorem 3] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: This property was first recognized by Prawitz [35] (for first order logic without equality) and later by Kanger <ref> [22] </ref> (for first order logic with equality). In first order logic with equality, the problem of checking the inconsistency of the paths results in SREU. 1.2 Outline of the Report In Chapter 2 we explain the notations used in the report.

Reference-contexts: This proof has its roots in [6] where it is proved that the 20 variable-bounded semi-unification 1 can be reduced to SREU. Semi-unification was proven undecidable by Kfoury, Tiuryn and Urzyczyn <ref> [23] </ref> and the monadic semi-unification was proven undecidable by Baaz [2]. A semi-unification problem consists of a set of expressions s i t i , 1 i n, where s i and t i are terms.

Reference-contexts: This is the main motivation behind the completion procedure <ref> [24] </ref> that attempts to construct a convergent rewrite system from a given set E of equations. <p> The kernel of this procedure is based on the superposition algorithm in combination with the critical pair lemma [13] or [21, Lemma 3.1]. (See also <ref> [24, Corollary of Theorem 5] </ref> or [21, Theorem 3.2].) This lemma can be used to prove that certain rewrite systems are confluent. In particular we have the following case.

Reference-contexts: The current status about what is known about SREU and rigid E-unification is summarized below. 1. Rigid E-unification with ground lefthand side is NP-complete <ref> [25] </ref>. Rigid E-unification in general is NP-complete and there exist finite complete sets of unfiers [16, 15]. 2. If all function symbols have arity 1 then SREU is PSPACE-hard [19]. If only one unary function symbol is allowed then the problem is decidable [7, 6].

Reference-contexts: If only constants are allowed then the problem is NP-complete [7] if there are at least two constants. 3. If there are more than one unary function symbol then the decidability is still an open question, it is known however that the word equation solving <ref> [28] </ref> (unification under associativity), which is an extremely hard problem (no interesting upper bounds for the complexity of this problem are yet known), can be reduced to SREU [6]. 4. In general SREU is undecidable [9], already with ground left hand sides [33] and two variables (this report).

Reference-contexts: The main theorem of this chapter is Theorem 3.2.4. Many properties of simultaneous rigid equations regarding representation of regular sets follow from it, for example Theorem 3.1.3. A result corresponding to Theorem 3.1.3 is stated also in <ref> [19, 33] </ref>. 1 Also several theorems used in Plaisted [33, Theorems 8.2-8.11] can be stated as corollaries of Theorem 3.2.4. 3.1 Words The basic components in our later constructions are words. Words are our choice of representing strings of characters, where characters are (represented by) just constants. <p> The main theorem of this chapter is Theorem 3.2.4.

The following statements are equivalent: 1 There is a minor technical mistake in <ref> [33, Theorem 8.5] </ref> (corresponding to our Theorem 3.1.3) where, given a regular set R, one has to consider a DFA that accepts the reverse of R, not R itself. 7 1. t is a word in L (M ) r r 2. t ! G M q for some q 2 <p> Similar technique was used by Plaisted <ref> [33] </ref> and we have taken the term shifted pairing from there. The main result of this chapter is Theorem 4.2.1. 4.1 Encoding Pairs of Strings Given a set of constants L 0 , we want to encode pairs of strings over in a simple manner. <p> So SREU is undecidable already with ground left hand sides (which was also shown by Plaisted <ref> [33] </ref>) and only two variables (that is a new result). We start by giving the formal definitions of the notions that are needed. The terminology is taken mainly from Hopcroft and Ullmann [20]. <p> Plaisted <ref> [33] </ref> has a proof for ground left hand sides and three variables on the right hand sides (and his proof uses several function symbols of arity 1 and 2). 5.3 Undecidability Proofs of SREU Here we outline the main points of some of the undecidability proofs of SREU that have emerged <p> To reduce PCP to SREU one uses the same basic technique that is used to reduce the membership problem above.

Some other decidable cases of SREU are also described by Plaisted [33]. It should also be noted that the decidability of SREU with just one variable is an open question and thus also the decidability of the 9-fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality. <p> In general SREU is undecidable [9], already with ground left hand sides <ref> [33] </ref> and two variables (this report).

Reference-contexts: So the first element of the last pair in D 0;0 (k; l) is kl. This can be expressed by a sytem of rigid equations. (Using two lists, in the same spirit as shifted pairing.) Similar technique is used by Voda and Komara <ref> [38] </ref> to claim (we did not check the details) the undecidability of the problem of Herbrand skeletons, i.e., given n and a formula = 9~x'(~x) where ' is quantifier free, if the Herbrand skeleton of size n of is solvable. (The Herbrand skeleton of size n of is the disjunction of <p> Voda and Komara have recently claimed that this problem is undecidable <ref> [38] </ref>. One should note that the classical and the intuitionistic provability of the "SREU formulas" is not the same in general even if all the left hand sides are ground. A simple counterexample is 9z ((c = 0 ) z = 1) ^ (c = 1 ) z = 0)).
