Abstract: We consider mixed finite element methods for second order elliptic equations on non-matching multiblock grids. A mortar finite element space is introduced on the non-matching interfaces. We approximate in this mortar space the trace of the solution, and we impose weakly a continuity of flux condition. A standard mixed finite element method is used within the blocks. Optimal order convergence is shown for both the solution and its flux. Moreover, at certain discrete points, superconvergence is obtained for the solution, and also for the flux in special cases. Computational results using an efficient parallel domain decomposition algorithm are presented in confirmation of the theory.

The reason to consider the interface operator is twofold. First, we use it to derive a bound on the error in the mortar space. Second, it is the basis for our parallel domain decomposition implementation. 6.1. The reduced problem.

Reference-contexts: A different boundary space is needed, which we call a mortar finite element space, using terminology from previous works on Galerkin and spectral methods (see <ref> [4] </ref> and references therein). As we show later in the analysis, the method is optimally convergent if the boundary space has one order higher approximability than the normal trace of the velocity space.

Reference-contexts: TX 78712; yotov@ticam.utexas.edu. 1 2 ARBOGAST, COWSAR, WHEELER, AND YOTOV A number of papers deal with the analysis and the implementation of the mixed methods applied to the above problem on conforming grids (see, e.g., [25, 23, 22, 7, 5, 6, 9, 12, 21, 26, 13, 15, 2, 1] and <ref> [24, 8] </ref>). Mixed methods on nested locally refined grids are considered in [14, 16]. These works apply the notion of "slave" or "worker" nodes to force continuity of fluxes across the interfaces. <p> Formulation of the method. A weak solution of (1.1)-(1.3) is a pair u 2 H (div; ), p 2 L 2 () such that (K 1 u; v) = (p; r v) hg; v i@; v 2 H (div; ); (2.1) It is well known (see, e.g., <ref> [8, 24] </ref>) that (2.1)-(2.2) has an unique solution.

Reference-contexts: The method using discontinuous mortars provides better local mass conservation across the interfaces, but numerical observations suggest that this may lead to slightly bigger numerical error. The method presented here has also been considered in <ref> [27] </ref> in the case of the lowest order Raviart-Thomas spaces [23, 22]. Here we take a somewhat different approach in the analysis, which allows us to relax a condition on the mortar grids needed to obtain optimal convergence and superconvergence. The relaxed condition is easily satisfied in practice. <p> Therefore k k d h can be characterized as a certain discrete H 1=2 -norm on (see <ref> [27] </ref>). This is also in accordance with the numerically observed O (h 2 ) convergence for the mortars in a discrete L 2 -norm (see Section 8). MIXED METHODS ON NON-MATCHING GRIDS 15 7.
