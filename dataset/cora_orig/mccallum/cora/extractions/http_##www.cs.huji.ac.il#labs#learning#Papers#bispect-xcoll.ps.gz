Reference-contexts: None of these attempts have realized the power of polyspectral techniques for the analysis of spectral blend. One of the most basic applications of bispectral methods reported in literature is the detection of phase coupling between harmonic components of a signal <ref> [3] </ref>. Such a phase coupling exists in most sounds produced by a single musical instrument (except idealized sine-tone generators). As claimed in section 3, the two strongest lowest frequency components of a musical signal are assumed to be harmonically related to another strong components at a higher frequency. <p> Since the power spectrum suppresses all phase relations, it cannot provide the answer. The bispec-trum, however, is capable of detecting and quantifying phase coupling. An illustrative example of such an effect can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. where a `quadratic phase coupling' phenomenon is treated, which occurs due to quadratic nonlinearities existing in a stochastic process. The non-zero bispectrum does not depend on this particular mechanism and it will hold for any case of statistical dependence between the phases.

Reference-contexts: k (! 1 ; ::; ! k1 ) = This property is important when considering the perception of simultaneously sounding independent signals as will be discussed later. 3 Sound Quality of Musical Instruments The first attempts to use bispectral considerations for sound quality characterization can be traced down to Gerzon <ref> [5] </ref>. For a musical tone, the power spectrum analysis shows how the fundamental frequency and it's higher harmonics compose together to form the timbre of the tone. However, the power spectrum, being "phase-blind", cannot reveal the relative phases between the sound components. <p> If b = b in for original signal, then after reverberation b out = (1 + k) 3=2 b in . Thus for a reverberation energy gain k, the relative bispectral level has been reduced by a factor (1+k) 3=2 <ref> [5] </ref>. Now consider a very similar effect of chorusing.

Reference-contexts: To simplify the matters, the discussion focuses on discrete signals. Some of the important relationships and properties of finite impulse response (FIR) signals and linear, time invariant systems are briefly reviewed. The results for general non-linear systems are more complex and require the use of Voltera-Wiener system theory <ref> [6] </ref>, which are beyond the scope of this presentation. 2.1 Multiple Correlations and Cumulants Extracting information from a signal is a basic question in every branch of science.

Reference-contexts: Surprisingly enough this theoretical criterion seems to be satisfied by many orchestral instruments. For example, particular cases of Stradi-varius violin (435 Hz, 535 Hz, 930 Hz), Contrabassoon (245 Hz, 435 Hz, 690 Hz) and Cor Anglais (985 Hz, 2160 Hz, 3480 Hz). In a later work, Lohman and Wirnitzer <ref> [11] </ref> analyzed two flutes by calculating their bispectra. Their results demonstrate that a higher intensity of the phase of the complex bispec-tra is achieved for the flute of good quality.

Reference-contexts: These random fluctuations between the harmonic partials of the sound add a sense of vitality to the signal, and we might suggest that there exists an analogy between this dispersion and the known meaningful variations in other musical parameters, such as the quality of intonation <ref> [15] </ref>. There is plenty of room for research in this area with several lines of investigation to be pursued. Mainly, there are many open psychoacoustical questions that need studying and extensive experimentation. Naturally, the implications of such results to modeling of the auditory mechanism could be very substantial.

Reference-contexts: Also, it is widely recognized that most of the timbral characteristics are time dependent and thus cannot be analyzed by the stationary methods discussed in this work. An extension of polyspectral methods to transient signal analysis seem to yield promising results <ref> [16] </ref>. One could study the use of nonlinear filters [17],[18] for processing of audio signals and obtaining a better control over the higher order spectra. Additionally, adaptation of the above techniques to investigation of other musical parameters is suggested.
