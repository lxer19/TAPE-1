Abstract: Let P = fP 0 ; : : : ; P n1 g denote a set of polynomials with complex coefficients. Let Z = fz 0 ; : : : ; z n1 g C denote any set of sample points. For any f = (f 0 ; : : : ; f n1 ) 2 C n the discrete polynomial transform of f (with respect to P and Z) is defined as the collection of sums, f b f(P 0 ); : : : ; b f(P n1 )g, where ^ f(P j ) = hf; P j i = P n1 In this paper we present fast algorithms for computing discrete orthogonal polynomial transforms. For a system of N orthogonal polynomials of degree at most N 1 we give an O(N log 2 N ) algorithm for computing a discrete polynomial transform at an arbitrary set of points instead of the N 2 operations required by direct evaluation. Our algorithm depends only on the fact that orthogonal polynomial sets satisfy a three-term recurrence and thus it may be applied to any such set of discrete sampled functions. In particular, sampled orthogonal polynomials generate the vector space of functions on a distance transitive graph. As a direct application of our work we are able to give a fast algorithm for computing subspace decompositions of this vector space which respect the action of the symmetry group of such a graph. This has direct applications to treating computational bottlenecks in the spectral analysis of data on distance transitive graphs and we discuss this in some detail.

Reference-contexts: We proceed by first recalling the fast monomial transform. This is obtained by writing it as the transpose of multiple-point polynomial evaluation and then formulating a well-known efficient algorithm for the latter process (cf. <ref> [BM] </ref>, Chapter 4) as a structured matrix factorization. We explain the full algorithm next and then close this section with an example. 2.1. Fast monomial transforms. <p> to be the n th roots of unity in C , z ` = exp ( 2i` n ): This projection may be obtained by the familiar FFT divide and conquer strategy in O (n log n) operations as opposed to the obvious O (n 2 ): General references include <ref> [BM, ER, N, TAL] </ref>. Notice that the abelian FFT gives rise to our first efficient spherical transform, corresponding to the n-gon graph. This is a fast discrete Chebyshev transform with samples at the Chebyshev points, cos 2` n . <p> This version of the FFT is achieved by efficient recursive application of the division algorithm (cf. <ref> [BM] </ref>). An advantage of this perspective is that it allows an easy generalization to the direct evaluation of polynomials at n real points. <p> Notice that fast polynomial arithmetic algorithms allow for the various moduli to be precomputed in O (n log 2 n) operations (cf. <ref> [BM] </ref>, Section 4.3). <p> Its inverse, G; is also lower triangular and Toeplitz, and may be computed in O (d log d) operations by a Newton iteration and then prestored (cf. <ref> [BM] </ref>, Chapter 4 as well as Remark 3 following the proof). Insert the result into equation (2.3). <p> Thus, in total three FFT's are required as well as one pointwise multiplication of a sequence of length 2b. If 2b = 2 r then an FFT of length 2b requires at most 3 2 2b r = 3br operations (cf. <ref> [BM] </ref>, p. 84). Consequently, the multiplication of a Toeplitz matrix of order b = 2 r1 by an arbitrary vector requires at most 3 3br + 2b operations or O (b log b) operations. <p> These may be generated recursively from the bottom of the tree up, using efficient polynomial multiplication routines which require O (m log m) operations to multiply two polynomials of degree m.( cf. <ref> [BM] </ref>, p. 86). Thus, at most O (n log 2 n) operations are needed to generate all 9 M l;i and the G 1 l;i ( cf. [BM], p. 100). <p> the tree up, using efficient polynomial multiplication routines which require O (m log m) operations to multiply two polynomials of degree m.( cf. <ref> [BM] </ref>, p. 86). Thus, at most O (n log 2 n) operations are needed to generate all 9 M l;i and the G 1 l;i ( cf. [BM], p. 100). Finally, to invert any particular G 1 l;i in order to obtain G l;i an additional O (l 2 l ) is needed ( cf. [BM], p. 96), so that in total, we require O (n log 2 n) operations to precompute the necessary data structure. 4. <p> most O (n log 2 n) operations are needed to generate all 9 M l;i and the G 1 l;i ( cf. <ref> [BM] </ref>, p. 100).

[BM], p. 96), so that in total, we require O (n log 2 n) operations to precompute the necessary data structure. 4. Notice that one direct result of an efficient monomial transform is that we can obtain an FFT at nonuniformly spaced frequencies.

Reference-contexts: In many important examples, (cf. <ref> [St1, St3] </ref> and the many references therein) these spherical functions are actually sampled orthogonal polynomials, and the spherical transform amounts to projection onto these polynomials in a weighted ` 2 space. <p> This is in fact the relevant family of orthogonal polynomials for the California Lottery example discussed in Section 1, and provide the spherical functions for the k-sets of n-set graph. We begin by summarizing the relevant properties of the Hahn polynomials. We follow Stanton's notation <ref> [St1] </ref> wherein is also contained a good bibliography for further sources. <p> Background and Notation. In the interest of making this paper as self-contained as possible, we sketch the group theoretic background and notation. We mainly follow Stanton's expositions <ref> [St1, St3] </ref> which are very accessible and provide a wealth of references. For the necessary graph theoretic terminology, with special attention paid to distance transitive graphs, see Biggs [Bi]. Serre's book [S] provides a nice introduction to the representation theory of finite groups. <p> Thus, the rotation group SO (3) acts two-point homogeneously on the 2-sphere. Stanton's papers <ref> [St1, St3] </ref> do a terrific job of spelling out these analogies. <p> For 0 k N , define the j X j fi j X j matrices D k by D k (x; y) = 1 if d (x; y) = k 0 otherwise. (3.4) Straightforward combinatorial arguments (eg. <ref> [St1, St3] </ref>) show that the D k commute and span the intertwining algebra, which must then be of dimension N +1. Even more, the algebra is generated by D 1 since the D k satisfy the following three-term recurrence ([St1, St3]), D 1 D i = c i+1 D i+1 + <p> For distance transitive graphs, the polynomial nature of the spherical functions is derived from the selfsame property of the commuting algebra for the representation of G in L 2 (X). As shown in <ref> [St1] </ref>, by evaluating the eigenvalue equation (3.7) at k we move the recurrence (3.5) to the i : i i ( k ) = fl k i ( k+1 ) + ff k i ( k ) + fi k i ( k1 );(3.8) where for any x 2 k , <p> As remarked, the polynomial nature follows from the polynomial relation of the D i . This is true in a slightly more general setting than distance transitive graphs. It can be extended to finite two-point homogeneous spaces in which the metric satisfies some technical properties (cf. <ref> [St1] </ref>, p. 90). Spherical functions may also be computed by character theoretic methods. Travis [Tr] generalizes this approach to construct "generalized" spherical functions attached to any pair of characters and for representations of a finite group G and subgroup H respectively. 3. <p> We can now compute the spherical functions as i ( j ) = c l=0 (K) s K j i l This is the Hahn polynomial Q i (j; K N 1; K 1; K) <ref> [KM, St1] </ref>. As we have already seen, these are orthogonal polynomials satisfying a three-term recurrence ( 2.27).

Reference-contexts: Applied science abounds with computations using such decompositions, along with the related computational techniques for calculation of correlation or projection of data onto a family of polynomials. To cite just a few examples, this sort of approach is used in spectral methods for solving differential equations <ref> [Bo, Te] </ref>, data analysis [D], signal and image processing [OS], and the construction of Gauss quadrature schemes [Ga1]. In most cases, the choice of a particular family of polynomials is determined by some special property or underlying symmetry of the problem under investigation.

Reference-contexts: to be the n th roots of unity in C , z ` = exp ( 2i` n ): This projection may be obtained by the familiar FFT divide and conquer strategy in O (n log n) operations as opposed to the obvious O (n 2 ): General references include <ref> [BM, ER, N, TAL] </ref>. Notice that the abelian FFT gives rise to our first efficient spherical transform, corresponding to the n-gon graph. This is a fast discrete Chebyshev transform with samples at the Chebyshev points, cos 2` n .

Reference-contexts: The proof of this theorem is not crucial for the main results, but it is worth remarking that it depends only on the fact that G acts two-point homogeneously on X and as such is a general fact about permutation representations (cf. <ref> [W] </ref>, Chapter 5, Section 29).
