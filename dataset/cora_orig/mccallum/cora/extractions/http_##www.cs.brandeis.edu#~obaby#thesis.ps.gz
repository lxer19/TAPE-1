Reference-contexts: Comparing a newly determined sequence with one of the databases is an important step in deriving useful information on DNA structure or function. A number of programs, including FASTA (Pearson and Lipman, 1988), BLAST <ref> (Altschul et al., 1990) </ref> and FLASH (Califano and Rigoutsos, 1993), as well as VLSI chips (Chow et al., 1991; Singh et al., 1996), have been designed to rapidly search each database for a query sequence.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, u and d can be obtained in O ( n p f 2 ) time. In practice, the matrices T (x) and T (x) T are rather sparse so that only the non zero values are used for computing and storing the results of the vector-matrix multiplications <ref> (Barrett et al., 1994) </ref>. Therefore, it is possible to compute u and d in O ( ne p ) time with O (p) processors, where e is the number of transitions of the NDFSA.

Reference-contexts: By comparing the observed and expected frequencies of words (or vocabularies) of different lengths in exons and introns, it can be shown that introns exhibit a specific non-random vocabulary containing a larger number of palindromic words than exons <ref> (Beckmann et al., 1986) </ref>. k-tuple Frequency Measure The k-tuple frequency analysis relies on the property that the frequencies of nucleotide sequences of length greater than three differ in exons and introns (Claverie and Bougueleret, 1986; Claverie et al., 1990).

Reference-contexts: there exists a binary associative operator fi such that: 8x:y:z; (x y) z = x (y fi z), then b can be computed in O (( m p + log p)(T 1 fi )) time using O (p) processors, where T 1 fi is the sequential time taken by fi <ref> (Blelloch, 1993) </ref>. The operator fi is called the companion operator of . 2. The vector b can be computed as in sequential except that the computation of b k from b k1 and a k is performed in parallel, i.e., is applied in parallel to its operands.

Reference-contexts: These variants often resort to Markov models to capture dependencies between adjacent codons (McCaldon and Argos, 1988; Borodovsky et al., 1994). Another variant of codon usage is the contrast word method <ref> (Brendel et al., 1986) </ref>. The key property in this approach is that words in an unknown language can be detected as the strings that are significantly more frequent than expected on random basis.

Reference-contexts: The mission of the geneticist or linguist is then to understand what the sequence is "trying to say" (Gribskov, 1992). The work in <ref> (Brendel and Busse, 1984) </ref> seems to be the first attempt to use the theory of formal languages to describe the structural properties of genes: in this work, a finite transducer is used to simulate the translation of mRNA (i.e., with no introns) into amino acid sequence. <p> The main reason is because these automata only described the patterns occurring at the splice sites (Kudo et al., 1987), with no special concern about the overall gene structure. In contrast, the NDFSA introduced in this chapter describe complete gene structures. As in <ref> (Brendel and Busse, 1984) </ref>, these NDFSA describe the various components of genes but, in addition, they take into account the non-determinism introduced by introns.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, it is not surprising that the methods described in this section also yield better results than those relying only on neural nets <ref> (Brunak et al., 1991) </ref>, in which all parameters or statistics have to be "learnt".

Reference-contexts: The relationship between the latter and Hidden Markov Models is analyzed in detail in <ref> (Bucher et al., 1996) </ref>. Although position weight matrices allow a better description of the splice sites than simple consensus, they have limited success when not used in conjunction with other methods (Senapathy et al., 1990).

Reference-contexts: Employing technology currently available, geneticists can chemically extract a fragment of (intron-less) mRNA and compare it with the DNA it originates from, or separate coding regions from non-coding ones <ref> (Buckler et al., 1991) </ref>. However, both approaches involve determining the nucleotide sequence of DNA fragments. This process, called sequencing, is both time-consuming and costly: it is estimated that present automated sequencing technology can accurately sequence more than 100; 000 bases per day at a cost of $:50 per base.

Reference-contexts: As a general rule, prediction accuracy decreases with both gene length and intron quantity. These observations are compatible with those made in (Duret et al., 1995) and <ref> (Burge, 1997) </ref>, wherein it is shown that (a) intron length tends to decrease | and exon length to increase | as a function of G + C content, and (b) long genes appear to be poorer in G + C nucleotides than short sequences. <p> We now demonstrate the well-foundedness of the above approach on human genes. Those are known to have more introns and more weakly conserved splice sites than yeast genes. 3.3 Evaluation on Human Sequences and Biological Interpreta tion The 238 human multi-exon genes of the learning set of GENSCAN <ref> (Burge, 1997) </ref> were used to construct an NDFSA denoted F 1 describing the sequences likely to occur at the splice sites in human genes. <p> Since this consensus occurs in less than 30% of human sequences <ref> (Burge, 1997) </ref>, a reasonable approach would be to define two NDFSA: one that includes the branch site in the description of introns, and the other that does not. One could then refine the consensus by inspecting the sequences that have non-conforming branch sites.

Reference-contexts: An alternative to CC is the average conditional probability measure <ref> (Burset and Guigo, 1996) </ref>, which is defined as the average of the quantities: S n , S p , S 0 n = T N=(T N + F N ) and p . The average is actually taken over those quantities that are defined (always at least two). <p> The average is actually taken over those quantities that are defined (always at least two). If all quantities are defined, the average conditional probability is: ACP = 4 T P + T N + F P T N + T P + F P In <ref> (Burset and Guigo, 1996) </ref>, it is observed that the scalar: AC = 2 fi ACP 1 termed approximate correlation is in practice closed to CC whenever CC is defined. <p> Using the latter database, a detailed discussion of the predictive accuracy of various gene structure prediction programs was carried out in <ref> (Burset and Guigo, 1996) </ref>. It was observed that the programs that perform similarity searches with the sequences in the protein databases yield better results than the other programs. <p> Finally, we provide a general strategy for parsing human genes and we evaluate the proposed approach on the 176 human genes of the test set proposed in <ref> (Burset and Guigo, 1996) </ref>. 52 3.2 The Approach, Explained Intuitively We believe that gene structure prediction should be performed in two steps: the first should optimize sensitivity, i.e., locate all regions that are likely to be coding, whereas the second should optimize specificity, i.e., detect the false positives produced during the <p> Since most gene structure prediction programs perform reasonably well in maximizing specificity <ref> (Burset and Guigo, 1996) </ref>, we focus on the first step. The following strategy is employed to maximize sensitivity: a sequence fragment is marked as coding even if it has a very small probability to be coding. <p> Also note that the particular order of the NDFSA in the hierarchy of Figure 3.5 was specifically chosen to maximize prediction accuracy for the 176 human sequences of the test set proposed in <ref> (Burset and Guigo, 1996) </ref>. The sensitivity and the specificity of the proposed approach on these 176 human sequences were respectively S n = 0:91 and S p = 0:83.

Reference-contexts: arises: given an NDFSA, can one design another NDFSA that would improve the expressiveness obtained? In other words, are the NDFSA obtained for the yeast genes or human genes the most probable models for the recognition of exons and introns? This is known to be a difficult problem in general <ref> (Cheeseman, 1990) </ref>. In defining an NDFSA, one has to be careful that an increase in the number of transitions t results in improved prediction, i.e., an increase in the value of AC. On the other hand, one should not overfit the data by defining NDFSA that are too specific.

Reference-contexts: We will say that the triplicity constraint is intrinsic. It should be noted that the terminology and notations used in this section are very similar to those used in <ref> (Cormen et al., 1990) </ref>, wherein a general framework is developed to solve problems involving directed graphs. Although the approach below is also based on directed graphs, it is perfected for the case in which these graphs are acyclic and for the particular problem of gene structure prediction. <p> Although the approach below is also based on directed graphs, it is perfected for the case in which these graphs are acyclic and for the particular problem of gene structure prediction. Our goal and approach are therefore radically different from those in <ref> (Cormen et al., 1990) </ref>. The definition of an intrinsic constraint relies on the concepts of decoration, summary and 103 decoration-summary system: * Given a graph G, a decoration labels every edge and every path in G.

Reference-contexts: The regions where the value of D is maximal (or greater than a given threshold) are then considered as coding. In <ref> (Fickett, 1982) </ref>, a similar measure is proposed but it is combined with the 33 frequencies of the four bases using a linear weighted sum. Local Compositional Complexity This measure is based on the observation that exons are less likely to be random sequences than introns.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, it is not surprising that the methods described in this section also yield better results than those relying only on neural nets (Brunak et al., 1991), in which all parameters or statistics have to be "learnt". However, integrated gene prediction programs have some limitations as well <ref> (Fickett, 1996a) </ref>: they are very organism specific; they assume that the sequence contains a single entire gene; they are sensitive to sequencing errors and they are not designed for particular situations such as alternative splicing and overlapping genes (see Section 2.3).

Reference-contexts: Integrated gene-finding programs are known to perform much better in predicting gene structures than stand-alone coding measures. It is estimated that the increase in accuracy obtained by incorporating overall gene structure information is approximately ten-fold <ref> (Fickett, 1996b) </ref>. In our view, the explicit formulation of the various statistics involved in the description of gene structure facilitates the task of the learning procedure that is often used to optimize parsing accuracy.

Reference-contexts: Note that the length of the window depends on the desired resolution and the method being employed. An exhaustive review and a comparison of existing coding measures is provided in <ref> (Fickett and Tung, 1992) </ref>. The purpose of this section, therefore, is to give the essentials of the search-by-content methods via the coding measures that are known to be the most effective for distinguishing exons from introns, i.e.: codon usage, k-tuple frequency, uneven positional base frequencies, and local compositional complexity.

Reference-contexts: In practice, to make the intrinsic constraint C computationally tractable, one would have to add to the label of every edge a score reflecting the coding potential of the associated sequence fragment. One would obtain, then, a linear version of the quadratic algorithm proposed in <ref> (Gelfand et al., 1996a) </ref>. This result will be discussed further in Section 4.6. <p> Furthermore, it is both a generalization and an improvement of current algorithms using dynamic programming. An important original contribution is that unlike other gene structure prediction programs, the algorithms described in this thesis do not use learning methods, sequence comparison, or statistical information to infer gene structure. To quote <ref> (Gelfand et al., 1996a) </ref>, "it is unlikely that algorithms 155 relying on statistical information can be significantly improved". It is also unlikely that learning methods or sequence comparison provide us with some insight about understanding the structure or function of DNA.

Reference-contexts: The mission of the geneticist or linguist is then to understand what the sequence is "trying to say" <ref> (Gribskov, 1992) </ref>. <p> On one hand, the main advantage of using grammars is that they can describe the genetic and evolutionary operations (such as mutations) that are essential for understanding the structure of DNA (Searls, 1993; Yokomori and Kobayashi, 1995). The use of grammars can be justified by the following metaphor <ref> (Gribskov, 1992) </ref>: just as languages change over time and location, proteins arising from the same gene may also diverge in their functions.

Reference-contexts: The first approach uses a tree instead of a DAG but is very similar to the other approaches. These trees or DAGs mainly differ by the objects, i.e., splice sites, exons or introns, represented by their nodes or edges. The first approach is the one proposed in <ref> (Guigo et al., 1992) </ref>. Like most other gene identification programs, it consists of the three following steps: 1. Detection of all potential donor and acceptor sites. This step is performed by using position weight matrices. 2. Determination of all putative exons from the set of predicted splice sites.

Let us assume that t represents the total length of all the possible patterns (i.e., the consensus) which can occur at the splice sites.

Reference-contexts: In the meantime, it may be worth specifying a general (and weak) consensus for the branch site, such as Y Y RAY , where Y 2 fC; T g and R 2 fA; Gg <ref> (Harris and Senapathy, 1990) </ref> . Since this consensus occurs in less than 30% of human sequences (Burge, 1997), a reasonable approach would be to define two NDFSA: one that includes the branch site in the description of introns, and the other that does not.

Reference-contexts: It is worth keeping in mind that in computer science there exist linear algorithms that can generate a compact representation for an exponential number of objects. One such example is the elimination of epsilon rules in context-free grammars <ref> (Harrison, 1978) </ref>. The approach described below is of similar nature. A DAG is constructed when given an NDFSA, and a string accepted by that NDFSA. The problem is to select in this DAG one or more paths having a semantic significance chosen by the user. <p> Indeed, it is well known that the parsing of strings in languages described by context-free grammars (CFGs) take O (n 3 ) time, where n is the length of the string to be parsed <ref> (Harrison, 1978) </ref>. That complexity renders impossible the parsing of potentially ambiguous strings containing (tens of) thousands of symbols, even using massively parallel computers. Note that it is not always necessary to write a grammar-based parser to test if a given string belongs to a context-free language.

Reference-contexts: This reformulation allows us to derive two parallel algorithms. The first uses a divide-and-conquer approach to compute the prefix sum. It is a generalization of the parallel algorithm in <ref> (Hillis and Steele, 1986) </ref> which determines if a given string is generated by a given deterministic finite-state automaton. The main drawback of the first algorithm is its worst time complexity: it takes O (( n p + log p)f 3 )) time on a PRAM with O (p) processors. <p> Many known parallel algorithms can be expressed as a prefix sum. In particular, it is shown in <ref> (Hillis and Steele, 1986) </ref> that the parsing of strings generated by deterministic finite-state automata can be reduced to a simple prefix sum computation.

Reference-contexts: Formal language specialists do not seem to have been interested in describing parsing ambiguities using NDFSA. Perhaps the rationale behind it has to do with a well known theorem that guarantees the construction of an equivalent deterministic finite state automata from any NDFSA <ref> (Hopcroft and Ullman, 1979) </ref>. However, that construction defeats the purpose of specifying NDFSA: not only the ambiguities are lost, but the time required for constructing the deterministic finite-state automata may be prohibitive since it is exponential.

Reference-contexts: Local Compositional Complexity This measure is based on the observation that exons are less likely to be random sequences than introns. Therefore, a simple way to locate exons and introns in a given sequence it to compute its local compositional complexity, which in <ref> (Konopka and Owens, 1990) </ref> is defined as Shannon entropy. The local compositional complexity H of a sequence is evaluated in a window of k nucleotides that slides along : X N i log k where N i is the number of occurrences of base i in the window.

Reference-contexts: Other existing linguistics-based approaches resort to stochastic grammars to deal with the formidable combinatorics involved in the construction of gene models. In <ref> (Krogh et al., 1994) </ref>, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is designed to find (intron-free) genes in E. coli DNA.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> (Kudo et al., 1987) </ref>, a generalization procedure is proposed to infer, from a training set of splice site sequences, a stochastic, deterministic regular grammar that describes the patterns at the 5 0 -splice sites of mammalian genes. <p> The main reason is because these automata only described the patterns occurring at the splice sites <ref> (Kudo et al., 1987) </ref>, with no special concern about the overall gene structure. In contrast, the NDFSA introduced in this chapter describe complete gene structures. <p> Also indicated are the length of the shortest and the longest sequence in each group. 85 The use of learning techniques may ease the process of refining the NDFSA, although previous attempts to infer NDFSA from finite sets of patterns had limited success <ref> (Kudo et al., 1987) </ref>. New algorithms have been recently proposed for NDFSA learning (Brave, 1996; Brazma and Cerans, 1997), but they perform poorly in capturing even very simple constraints such as triplicity.

Reference-contexts: In particular, statistical evidence indicated that the sequences at both ends of the introns were more or less conserved (Sharp, 1981), i.e., remained almost the same from one sequence to another. This observation led to the creation of catalogs of consensus sequences <ref> (Mount, 1982) </ref>, which are patterns specifying the most common sequences of nucleotides surrounding the splice sites. <p> numbered from left to right such that the first base after the splice junction is at position +1 and the first base before the splice junction is at position 1. donor splice sites of the nuclear and viral protein-coding genes resulted in the derivation of the consensus in Figure 2.7 <ref> (Mount, 1982) </ref> 6 . The second step consists of using a pattern matching algorithm to detect all occurrences of the consensus in newly sequenced genes. Each occurrence corresponds then to a predicted donor or acceptor splice site. <p> For each position, the elements of the weight matrix in the corresponding column represent the logarithms of the frequencies with which the bases occur in the reference set.

Reference-contexts: The remaining states of F 0 are used to define the introns and correspond to the GT AG rule.

First of all, the rules (a) and (b) are compatible with the following observation <ref> (Ruby and Abelson, 1991) </ref>, which was made for the yeast genes containing a single intron (most of them do): if more than one potential donor (or acceptor) splice sites are detected, then the splice site closer to the branch site is the actual one.

In <ref> (Searls, 1993) </ref>, it is shown that the language of DNA is beyond context-free but within the class of indexed languages. A formalism called string variable grammar, or SVG, that is less general but easier to handle than indexed grammars is then derived (Searls, 1995b).

Reference-contexts: In contrast, the NDFSA introduced in this chapter describe complete gene structures. As in (Brendel and Busse, 1984), these NDFSA describe the various components of genes but, in addition, they take into account the non-determinism introduced by introns. It should be noted that in <ref> (Searls, 1994) </ref>, non determinism is also used to express parsing ambiguities, but a different approach relying on stochastic context-free grammars is used to predict gene structure. In this approach, the exhaustive search over the combinatorial space of gene assemblies is avoided by considering only the best 100 gene structures.

Reference-contexts: In (Searls, 1993), it is shown that the language of DNA is beyond context-free but within the class of indexed languages. A formalism called string variable grammar, or SVG, that is less general but easier to handle than indexed grammars is then derived <ref> (Searls, 1995b) </ref>. A string variable grammar allows variables denoting substrings of unbounded length to appear on the right-hand sides of otherwise context-free rules. <p> As noted by Searls in <ref> (Searls, 1995b) </ref>, this "minimalist" approach is motivated not only by the algorithmic difficulties associated with more complex representations (such as context-free grammars or DAGs with more than two types of nodes) but also by "a hope that the search for a formalism with just necessary and sufficient power" will help to

Reference-contexts: This shu*ing facilitated the creation of new proteins and accelerated the evolution of organisms. Another theory claims that the presence of introns in genes is the result of a selective pressure to avoid the too frequently occurring stop codons (in exons), and increase the length of proteins <ref> (Senapathy, 1988) </ref>. This theory predicts that there must have existed some mechanism, termed stop-codon walk mechanism, to scan a DNA sequence and mark as an intron 21 every region with an in-frame stop codon. <p> Finally, the significant decrease in prediction accuracy when in-frame stop codons are ignored 67 supports the theory of stop-codon walk mechanism mentioned in Section 2.1.2 <ref> (Senapathy, 1988) </ref>. Recall that, according to this theory, the splicing mechanism originally evolved to avoid the too-frequent occurrences of stop codons in genes. In other words, the role of the splicing machinery is to discard every region of a gene that contains one or more in-frame stop codons.

Reference-contexts: The relationship between the latter and Hidden Markov Models is analyzed in detail in (Bucher et al., 1996). Although position weight matrices allow a better description of the splice sites than simple consensus, they have limited success when not used in conjunction with other methods <ref> (Senapathy et al., 1990) </ref>. Search-by-signal methods often predict more false sites, i.e., sites that are not actual exon-intron boundaries, than true sites (Brunak et al., 1991; Frech et al., 1997). <p> In the meantime, it may be worth specifying a general (and weak) consensus for the branch site, such as Y Y RAY , where Y 2 fC; T g and R 2 fA; Gg <ref> (Harris and Senapathy, 1990) </ref> . Since this consensus occurs in less than 30% of human sequences (Burge, 1997), a reasonable approach would be to define two NDFSA: one that includes the branch site in the description of introns, and the other that does not.

Reference-contexts: In particular, statistical evidence indicated that the sequences at both ends of the introns were more or less conserved <ref> (Sharp, 1981) </ref>, i.e., remained almost the same from one sequence to another. This observation led to the creation of catalogs of consensus sequences (Mount, 1982), which are patterns specifying the most common sequences of nucleotides surrounding the splice sites.

Reference-contexts: One of the explanations for the introns-late theory proposes that self-splicing introns (that can splice themselves without the help of a spliceosome) would have been inserted into mRNA and integrated into DNA by a process called reverse transcription <ref> (Sharp, 1985) </ref>. Another explanation stipulates that introns arose by the insertion of transposable elements, i.e., small, mobile DNA sequences that can replicate, into preexisting genes (Cavalier-Smith, 1985).

Reference-contexts: We conclude this thesis by providing an example of application in the area of natural language processing: the automatic restoration of accents in French texts <ref> (Simard, 1996) </ref>. The problem of unaccented French texts typically arises in the context of electronic mail (email) messages. People who exchange email in French are often confronted with texts containing characters that should be accented but are not. <p> The set of all parses of a given sentence would then represent all accentuation possibilities for that sentence. A criterion could then be used to generate the most probable meaning (s) of the sentence being analyzed. 165 Note that the algorithm proposed in <ref> (Simard, 1996) </ref> to restore the accents in French texts relies on a hidden Markov model.

A deterministic finite-state machine is also used in <ref> (Smith, 1988) </ref> but to detect restriction sites (i.e., a short specific nucleotide sequence at which a particular protein, called restriction enzyme, cuts the DNA).

Reference-contexts: The local compositional complexity of is then calculated as follows: K = k k! Experimentation with various lengths indicates that when using a window of length k = 8, the values of K are generally higher in exons than in introns <ref> (Snyder and Stormo, 1995) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The optimal parse, i.e., the parse with the highest score, is selected as the most probable gene model. The programs that implement the above strategy are designated as integrated gene identification systems. These programs, reviewed in <ref> (Snyder and Stormo, 1997) </ref>, mainly differ in the way the putative 35 exons and introns are determined. As no single measure can per se accurately discriminate exons from introns, a multitude of tests are usually performed to quantify the various properties characteristic of these sequences.

Reference-contexts: The two best programs (Guigo et al., 1992; Snyder and Stormo, 1995) based on protein sequence homology have both the same approximate correlation, i.e., AC = 0:86, when averaged by sequence over the 176 human sequences, whereas the best program based on sequence information only <ref> (Solovyev et al., 1994) </ref> has AC = 0:80 as approximate correlation. <p> Note that these values were obtained by applying first the most general NDFSA, and then the other, alternative NDFSA. coefficient were AC = CC = 0:80. Although the value of AC obtained is the same as the best existing program that does not use sequence homology <ref> (Solovyev et al., 1994) </ref>, it should be noted that in our approach this accuracy is obtained with a much simpler and more explicit model.

Reference-contexts: It is useful, then, to classify the consensus according to their occurrence frequencies in the reference set (Kolchanov et al., 1991; Kudo et al., 1992). An alternative and improvement to using different consensus is the technique of position weight matrices <ref> (Staden, 1984) </ref>. Position Weight Matrices (PWM) A position weight matrix is a matrix whose rows are indexed by the four bases A, C, G, T and whose columns represent the different positions in the splice sites.

Reference-contexts: Based on the value of d (i) obtained for each pair, the base at position i is marked as coding or non-coding. Uneven Positional Base Frequencies Measure This measure <ref> (Staden, 1990) </ref> takes advantage of the observed unequal use of the four bases in the three reading frames. This inequality of use is claimed to be more pronounced in exons than in introns.

Reference-contexts: These measures take advantage, in one way or another, of the non-random and repetitive character of DNA. Codon Usage Measure The codon usage measure <ref> (Staden and McLachlan, 1982) </ref> was one of the first to be proposed for detecting biologically interesting regions in DNA sequences. It relies on the fact that certain codons are more likely to occur in coding regions than in non-coding ones (these "preferred" codons vary from one organism to another).

Reference-contexts: The elements of the PWM then represent the logarithms of the frequencies with which the dinucleotides occur at each position in the signal. The problem of selecting the most appropriate position weight matrix for a given signal is discussed in <ref> (Stormo, 1990) </ref> whereas the various existing PWM search programs are reviewed in (Frech et al., 1997). In (Berg and von Hippel, 1987; von Hippel, 1994), the notion of position weight matrices is extended to that of discrimination energy for predicting the signals occurring at the protein binding sites.

Reference-contexts: For example, by combining the methods discussed in Sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3, one can often obtain a good estimate of where the putative exons and introns are in the sequence being analyzed. The gene structure prediction problem can then be formulated according to the methodology in <ref> (Stormo and Haussler, 1994) </ref>. Given a subsequence = i i+1 : : : j of a sequence of length n, one can define a score T (i; j) for each statistic in a collection "exon statistics". <p> These "brute-force" methods were soon followed by more sophisticated algorithms using dynamic programming (Snyder and Stormo, 1993; Xu et al., 1994). In particular, there exists a general dynamic programming algorithm for calculating when the score function fi is linear in the adjustable weight parameters w and w <ref> (Stormo and Haussler, 1994) </ref>, or monotonically increasing (Gelfand and Roytberg, 1993; Gelfand et al., 1996b). For each exon statistic and intron statistic , the weights w and w are determined from a training set of sequences whose gene structure is known. <p> There have been two tentative approaches to solve this problem, resulting in two different algorithms. The first algorithm (Snyder and Stormo, 1993; Snyder and Stormo, 1995) finds a weighting such that most, but not all, sequences in the training set are correctly parsed. In contrast, the second algorithm <ref> (Stormo and Haussler, 1994) </ref> finds a weighting such that most, but not all, optimal parses correspond to actual gene structure.

Reference-contexts: Another possible extension would be to specify different splice site consensus or weight matrices for each reading frame. Indeed, there is statistical evidence that the reading frame in which splicing is more likely to occur differs from one codon to another <ref> (Tomita et al., 1996) </ref>. Therefore, it would be certainly advantageous to enhance the description of gene models such that the definition of an intron does not depend only on the codon it interrupts but also on the reading frame in which this codon is interrupted.

Reference-contexts: On one hand, the first of these problems is simpler than the other ones because it does not involve the combinatorial explosion associated with the search over the space of all possible gene structures.
