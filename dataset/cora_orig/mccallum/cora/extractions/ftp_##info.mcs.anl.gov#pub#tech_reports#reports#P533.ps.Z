Abstract: In this paper we present a version of the (static) traffic equilibrium problem in which the cost incurred on a path is not simply the sum of the costs on the arcs that constitute that path. We motivate this nonadditive version of the problem by describing several situations in which the classical additivity assumption fails. We also present an algorithm for solving nonadditive problems that is based on the recent NE/SQP algorithm, a fast and robust method for the nonlinear complementarity problem. Finally, we present a small example that illustrates both the importance of using nonadditive costs and the effectiveness of the NE/SQP method.

Reference-contexts: Examples of column generation methods as applied to the TEP include the early work of Leventhal, Nemhauser and Trotter [24], who studied the case of separable costs; Bertsekas and Gafni [8], who combined a projection method for the associated VI with a decomposition by O-D pairs; and Aashtiani <ref> [1] </ref> whose Ph.D. dissertation concerned a similar approach. See the survey [21] for further details. In this section, we present a new algorithm for solving the path-flow formulation of the TEP that is based on the recent NE/SQP method (for non-smooth equations/sequential quadratic programming) for solving the NCP [28, 17].

Reference-contexts: In order to prove existence/uniqueness results and develop convergent algorithms, this problem has been formulated as a nonlinear program (NLP) [5], a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) <ref> [2, 33] </ref>, a variational inequality problem (VI) [10, 11, 12, 30], and a fixed-point problem (FP) [4]. Though the traffic equilibrium problem generally is stated in terms of path flows, paths usually are considered to be a nuisance by the developers of algorithms. There are two reasons. <p> Most existing "path flow" formulations of TEP continue to be appropriate when using such a nonadditive path cost function. For our purposes, the most important of these is the NCP formulation <ref> [2] </ref>. In this formulation, the problem is to find the (path flows, O-D costs) vector pair (F; u) such that G F (F; u) = C (F ) u 0 F 0 G F (F; u) T F = 0 (5) where is the path-Origin-Destination pair incidence matrix. <p> Additionally, 6 we assume that D i is a nonnegative function for all i 2 I. As a result, an equivalent system has T F D (u) 0 replaced by T F D (u) = 0, which is the more usual form of the conservation of demand constraint <ref> [2] </ref>. We note that if the ith O-D pair has positive demand (i.e., D i (u) &gt; 0) the u i variable measures the cost on the cheapest path value for O-D pair i. <p> In what follows, we will need to assume that the traffic equilibrium problems being solved are guaranteed to have a solution. We make use of the following result, which is Theorem 5.4 in <ref> [2] </ref>. Theorem 1 Suppose (N; A) is a strongly connected network and that C p : R + ! R + is a positive continuous function for all p 2 P .

Reference-contexts: For example, the simultaneous route and departure-time equilibrium problem [16] is most easily formulated using path variables. As another example, researchers have struggled with including entropy terms in TEP <ref> [6] </ref> because they include path variables. The ideas developed here should both facilitate the solution of those problems and allow them to be expanded to include nonadditive costs.

Reference-contexts: We will make the weak assumption that @C p @F p &gt; 0 for all paths p. Then, since A is the sum of two matrices with nonnegative entries one of 19 which has positive diagonals (i.e., M T NN M NN ), by Theorem 3.8.15 in <ref> [9] </ref>, A is a Q-matrix for which the LCP above has a solution for all possible b. It should be clear that great computational savings may be achieved by computing a search direction in the manner described above, essentially avoiding solving the QP subproblem of size n S 0 .

Reference-contexts: As a result, the feasible region is a nonempty polyhedron. Hence, taken together with the fact that the objective function is a quadratic bounded below by zero, this QP will always have a solution (by the Frank-Wolfe theorem <ref> [15] </ref>). In addition, this is a relatively easy QP to solve because it has a convex objective function and simple bound constraints. Two conditions are sufficient to guarantee the convergence of the NE/SQP method. The first condition is s-regularity and generalizes the idea of non-singularity.

Reference-contexts: In addition, it is important to consider how the ideas developed here can be applied to other path-based network equilibrium problems.

Also, even if this condition were encountered during the running of the algorithm, we could just restart at a new point.

Reference-contexts: However, it has often been observed <ref> [19] </ref> that people value time nonlin-early. That is, small amounts of time have relatively low value whereas large amounts of time are very valuable. As a result, one must first calculate the total time on the path and apply the value of time function to this total.

Reference-contexts: This strategy may result in nonadditive costs for two reasons. First, there is some evidence that emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are a nonlinear function of travel times. Second, there is little doubt that social costs are a nonlinear function of emissions <ref> [20] </ref>. Hence, in order to set tolls equal to the the difference between the social marginal cost and the private average cost, they will need to be path-specific. Such a path-specific toll structure immediately leads to nonadditive path cost functions.
