Reference-contexts: Besides this, numerous researches emphasize the role of concepts or general knowledge in building CBR-systems from a technical point of view. For example <ref> [ Aamodt, 1991 ] </ref> pointed out that case retieval based on more semantic or pragmatic criteria is much more efficient. It reduces search space and in general assists in all, or a subset of, case-based problem solving tasks. <p> by similarity and grouping by proxi mity, which are well known from gestalt psychology. * Secondly, we model a top-down concept recognition process in which these groupings of the new case will be matched with a symbolic representation of spatial concepts. 90 8.3 SIMILARITY CONCEPT According to the notion of <ref> [ Aamodt, 1991 ] </ref> , our bottom-up grouping process is knowledge-poor, whereas the top-down concept recognition process is very knowledge intensive [ Aa-modt, 1990 ] .

Reference-contexts: While most approaches use the bottom-up way to assess similarity, we propose a system architecture that combines data-driven and concept-driven processes. A second distinguishing feature in AI as well as in cognitive psychology is the difference between factual knowledge and knowledge about how to do things <ref> [ Anderson, 1990 ] </ref> [ Ne-well, 1982 ] . The former is called declarative, the latter procedural. <p> The former is called declarative, the latter procedural. The main argument for a procedural knowledge representation is that human knowledge is clearly organized towards goals, the decomposition into subgoals and a selection of a set of operators to transform one state of problem space into another <ref> [ Anderson, 1990 ] </ref> . Another argument is that psychological experiments indicate that declarative knowledge is not sufficient for expertise [ Ceci and Liker, 1986 ] . <p> The major problem facing the perceptual system is that it must, with only limited resources, process this great load of information in such a way that the environment makes sense. The system utilizes various pattern recognizers and some basic Gestalt principles of organization to structure these sensory data ( <ref> [ Anderson, 1990 ] </ref> , p.83). Taken the above together, there are several good reasons to model similarity assessment of spatial arrangements as a combination of low-level processes of perception and high-level processes of searching for common concepts.

Reference-contexts: Only they are inspected for retrieval. In FABEL, we are experimenting with seven different kinds of layout interpretations (cf. figure 10.3), which have been detailed in the preceding chapters. Feature vectors (1) are the standard representation in case-based reasoning (cf. [ Ries-beck and Schank, 1989 ] , <ref> [ Bareiss, 1991 ] </ref> , or [ Kolodner, 1993 ] ). Originally, we planned to use it for semantic attributes only.

Reference-contexts: Declarative and procedural knowledge differ in much more (for similarity assessment) important ways. To apply declarative knowledge takes much time, whereas procedural knowledge is executable very rapidly; declarative knowledge is often described as being more explainable, whereas people have difficulty in explaining procedural know Fabel-Report No. 13 89 ledge <ref> [ Barsalou, 1992 ] </ref> . If somebody looks at how architects tackle problems for example, numerous indications are that they use both kinds of knowledge to more or less the same extent. 8.3.1.1 Knowledge-intensive similarity assessment: Integration of perception and cognition Concepts are the building blocks of cognition.

Reference-contexts: The methods differ in how they interpret layout fragments, and in the comparison method and memory organisation they employ. Several approaches to case-based or analogical reasoning deal with pre- and postselec-tion (e.g. [ Holyoak and Koh, 1987 ] , <ref> [ Beauboucher, 1993 ] </ref> , [ Montazeri and Adam, 1993 ] , [ Cunningham, 1993 ] , [ Maiden, 1993 ] ). Most prominent is the two-stage MAC-FAC-model [ Gentner and Forbus, 1991 ] . At first, any cases are recalled using a computationally cheap filter.

Reference-contexts: The most specific common structure together with the modifications applied in a definite sequence will constitute structural similarity of cases. Without loss of generality, we will use a term-based approach to knowledge representation. Using a graph-based knowledge representation would also be possible (cf. <ref> [ Borner et al., 1993a ] </ref> ). 6.3.1.1 Knowledge representation Cases will be represented according to definition 6.2 given in section 6.3. To represent cases in an attribute-based manner we will use the A4-representation as introduced in chapter 1. <p> O'Hara (cf. [ Indurkhya, 1991; Indurkhya, 1992; O'Hara, 1992 ] ). 4 An introduction into the transfer of the approach to graph based representations can be found in <ref> [ Borner et al., 1993a ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: Influenced by the work of Bipin Indurkhya and Scott O'Hara (cf. [ Indurkhya, 1991; Indurkhya, 1992; O'Hara, 1992 ] ) we represent the complex structures of related objects as terms over some appropriately tailored signature. The formal definition can be found in <ref> [ Borner, 1993b; Borner, 1993a ] </ref> . For instance, the term (copy (X, 2, object)) means: take one object, copy it 2 times, and arrange them in X-direction. Additionally, equational knowledge about functions and their relations is formalized as rule-based background knowledge about proper modifications of fragments.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we discuss our approach and evaluate its efficiency, complexity, and applicability. 6.2 Derived representation Knowledge forms the basis of reasoning. That's why we will start by introducing the attribute-based and structural case and background knowledge representation scheme. Based on this, we will formalize structural similarity assessment (cf. <ref> [ Borner, 1993b ] </ref> ). The extended case representation is made up of six parts. First we have an attribute-based representation of initial state and goal state. To describe structural attributes of composite objects and their relations, we will endow initial and goal state descriptions with their structural representation. <p> Influenced by the work of Bipin Indurkhya and Scott O'Hara (cf. [ Indurkhya, 1991; Indurkhya, 1992; O'Hara, 1992 ] ) we represent the complex structures of related objects as terms over some appropriately tailored signature.

Reference-contexts: We propose a scenario for combining our retrieval methods. 10.1 Why so many retrieval methods? One goal of the FABEL project is to support (building) 1 designers with the layout of complex technical systems. In AI ever since <ref> [ Brown and Chandrasekaran, 1989 ] </ref> , design tasks have been viewed as ranging from routine via innovative to creative ones. We are faced with design tasks that are too complex to be solved by the configuration methods for routine design ( [ Brown and Chandrasekaran, 1989 ] , [ Cunis <p> In AI ever since <ref> [ Brown and Chandrasekaran, 1989 ] </ref> , design tasks have been viewed as ranging from routine via innovative to creative ones. We are faced with design tasks that are too complex to be solved by the configuration methods for routine design ( [ Brown and Chandrasekaran, 1989 ] , [ Cunis et al., 1991 ] , [ Gero, 1992 ] ) because our domain is not sufficiently formalized in theory and because a full formal treatment would be too complex in practice, either.

Reference-contexts: A number of researchers in this domain ada pt the position that perceptual parsimony is achieved, by making use of specific world knowledge to infer, from sensory data, what it is that gave rise to those data <ref> [ Bruce and Green, 1992 ] </ref> . To sum up now from a cognitive science point of view, it is sufficient to understand that perception can be described as a process that combines data-driven (bottom-up) and concept-driven (top-down) processes. <p> larger perceptual "chunks"? In Gestalt psychology [ Kohler, 1947 ] [ Metzger, 1966 ] there is a long research tradition into how human perceive spatial relations and the gestalt psychologists formulated a number of principles of perceptual organization to describe how certain perceptions are more likely to occur then others <ref> [ Bruce and Green, 1992 ] </ref> . Some of these principles have primarily to do with the grouping of figures or sub-regions of figures and a lot of researchers adapt the physiological position, that in this process cognitive processes are at most secondary. <p> Dynamic gestalts: Besides the set of predefined gestalts, we experiment with dynamically assembled ones. We take into account principles of human perception of spatial relations or gestalts, in particular those of grouping by proximity and grouping by similarity ( [ Kohler, 1929 ] , <ref> [ Bruce and Green, 1992 ] </ref> , [ Metzger, 1966 ] ). Accordingly, we interpret each set of objects as a specific spatial arrangement or gestalt in terms of primitive and complex spatial relations. 114 10.4 HOW TO RETRIEVE LAYOUT FRAGMENTS? 10.4 How to retrieve layout fragments? similar layouts.

Reference-contexts: We think that graphs are more suitable for complex non-hierarchical structures and that they are more expensive to process than trees. There are other approaches like <ref> [ Bunke and Messmer, 1993 ] </ref> which use decision tree structures to enable an efficient comparison of one new graph representing the actual problem to a set of graphs representing the problem parts of the cases contained in the case library. <p> In general, the computational effort is compared to the approaches described in the other chapters of this report relatively high. It grows with increasing numbers of nodes and edges in the best case polynomially and in the worst case exponentially <ref> [ Bunke and Messmer, 1993 ] </ref> . Fabel-Report No. 13 57 5.5.2 Case library If we use the approach described in this chapter we have no problem with incrementally growing case libraries. <p> Somewhat related is the approach described in <ref> [ Bunke and Messmer, 1993 ] </ref> for the similarity of structured representations. Dynamic gestalts: The interpretation of the query fragment in terms of spatial relations is structurally matched with those in a linear casebase. The list of returned cases is variable.

Reference-contexts: If a solution has to be modified the adaptation rules modify parts of the stored original solution path, and so the solution will be adapted indirectly. MEDIATOR, for example, uses derivational adaptation [ Simpson, 1985 ] and <ref> [ Carbonell, 1986 ] </ref> analyses the theoretical implications of this approach. This reports describes different approaches to the first two problems: case representation and similarity. Adaption will be investigated in a later phase of the project. The articles reflect their authors' very different professions and backgrounds. <p> general knowledge cames from a talk of Agnar, when he stayed as a guest scientist at our Institute in 1993. 3 From the standpoint of adaptation in particular Carbonell emphasize the helpfulness of not only to store a (static) solution but the set of applied operators that constructed this solution <ref> [ Carbonell, 1986 ] </ref> . <p> Figure 8.26 (c) shows the solution of this problem by adapting the given example figure 8.26 (a). problem Following <ref> [ Carbonell, 1986 ] </ref> the core idea here is not only to store a solution but also the set of applied operators that constructed this solution.

Reference-contexts: Another argument is that psychological experiments indicate that declarative knowledge is not sufficient for expertise <ref> [ Ceci and Liker, 1986 ] </ref> . However, declarative knowledge is very important, because many experiments have shown that it can be adapted readily to a wide variety of specific situations. Procedural knowledge is much more rigid and more useful in specific contexts.

Reference-contexts: Our approach to indexing, similarity assessment, case memory and retrieval of architectural designs is implemented and part of the first FABEL-prototype [ Durschke et al., 1993 ] ; a short description is given in chapter 4 of <ref> [ Coulon et al., 1993 ] </ref> . 12 Fabel-Report No. 13 13 2.2 Derived representation This section is divided into three parts: using an example case we will show how the derived representation is calculated, we will describe the properties of the indices, and we will give reasons for our choices. <p> So in this domain attributes are called symptoms and the attribute-value pairs are called observations. This terminology is still used in the implementation and description of this retrieval method. The major advantage of this attribute value based case memory is its completely object oriented design and implementation <ref> [ Coulon et al., 1993 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: The center of the bounding box being next to the center of gravity of the whole fragment is placed in the center of the bitmap <ref> [ Coulon, 1993 ] </ref> . The second step calculates a grey-value for each pixel of a bitmap representation (A ! B). It specifies how much space of the pixel is filled by the fragment. The regions scaled to one pixel overlap.

Reference-contexts: Figure 10.1 shows some layout fragments. Since the databases are huge, an automatic retrieval of layouts relevant to the problem at hand would be of substantial help, extending the human designer's memory and reducing his manual search. In this respect, we came to similar conclusions as the ARCHIE-project <ref> [ Domeshek and Kolodner, 1991 ] </ref> . Different from them, our (building) projects are too complex to be meaningful units of retrieval. A project may consist of up to a hundred thousand objects, while fragments meaningful for retrieval are made of ten up to a hundred of them. <p> There are two approaches that are related to ours because they are concenred with an architectural domain. ARCHIE <ref> [ Domeshek and Kolodner, 1991 ] </ref> deals with the very earliest 124 10.7 CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK phases of design, where there may not even be a roombook, and its cases are stories about complete buildings that are retrieved by feature vectors.

Reference-contexts: Bitmap interfaces are also used for display on the screen, from which the human visual system is extremely good at extracting relevant structures or gestalts. Predefined gestalts: The notion of gestalt originated from gestalt psychology (cf. [ Kofka, 1935 ] or [ Kohler, 1947 ] , see <ref> [ Ertel et al., 1975 ] </ref> for an overview of the theory of gestalts in modern psychology). Similar to [ Rome, 1992 ] , we mean by gestalt a group of objects that are spatially perceived as a whole.

Thus, retrieval and case-based reasoning methods suited for data records or texts will not do (see [ Salton and McGill, 1983 ] or <ref> [ Gebhardt, 1981 ] </ref> for surveys of information retrieval, [ Riesbeck and Schank, 1989 ] or [ Kolodner, 1993 ] for surveys of case-based reasoning, [ Medin et al., 1993 ] or [ Gregson, 1975 ] for psychological perspectives). <p> dynamically restricted to or constructed for, say a set of preselected fragments? What about the quality of the result? How large is the percentage of useful fragments, those which can be adapted to the current problem context with reasonable effort? In analogy to ordinary databases, we call this property "precision" <ref> [ Gebhardt, 1981 ] </ref> . And analogously to recall, we may ask how many of the useful fragments in the database actually get retrieved? Scope: Finally, we would like to know how specific the approaches are to our architectural domain.

Reference-contexts: There are numerous problems, since the importance of features often changes depending on the problem. The important advantage of this approach, however, is that it is very efficient and computationally less expensive. The third point of view is particularly presented by Gentner and colleagues [ Gentner, 1983 ] <ref> [ Gentner and Forbus, 1991 ] </ref> . In her structure-mapping theory she points out that a theory about similarity e.g. analogy must describe how the meaning of an analogy is derived from the meaning of its parts [ [ Gentner, 1983 ] , p. 155]. <p> For simplicity, we consider only the six above-mentioned parts. 6.3 Similarity concept This extended case representation permits similarity assessments at two stages. Similar approaches have been advocated by Dedre Gentner and Kenneth D. Forbus (cf. <ref> [ Gentner and Forbus, 1991 ] </ref> ). First, we use the attribute-based representation to determine a set of possible candidate cases 1 . Thereby, the set of cases will be restricted considerably. <p> By making appeal to different mathematical concepts, relational and operational description express a difference in emphasis too, i.e. emphasis on the perceptive (static) or the constructive (dynamic) aspect of spatial arrangements, respectively. For example, we have on one hand Gentner's structure-mapping theory [ Gentner, 1983 ] <ref> [ Gentner and Forbus, 1991 ] </ref> [ Medin et al., 1993 ] , focussing on the perceptual aspects of a case. In her theory the "meaning" of a given case is derived from the relations of its parts, and a case is described by higher order relations between its parts. <p> Several approaches to case-based or analogical reasoning deal with pre- and postselec-tion (e.g. [ Holyoak and Koh, 1987 ] , [ Beauboucher, 1993 ] , [ Montazeri and Adam, 1993 ] , [ Cunningham, 1993 ] , [ Maiden, 1993 ] ). Most prominent is the two-stage MAC-FAC-model <ref> [ Gentner and Forbus, 1991 ] </ref> . At first, any cases are recalled using a computationally cheap filter. Hereafter, a few of these candidates are selected by a more expensive matching process that returns useful, structurally sound matches. The two stages reduce overall complexity.

Reference-contexts: Abstract representations simplify reasoning by preserving certain desirable properties. They should be simpler to handle than the original representation to justify the additional expense in constructing them from the original representation.

Until now four software prototypes - A1 - A4 were developed on the base of ARMILLA. <p> This kind of representation is also in accordance with former reflections about the graph structure of the domain elements carried out by our domain experts (cf. <ref> [ Haller, 1985 ] </ref> ). In general, there are mainly two ways to come to an adequate graph representation for a layout fragment: * All architectural objects which appear in the layout are represented as nodes. <p> Since we knew of no single method satisfying these demands, we began exploring several alternatives in parallel.

Reference-contexts: Within the vast domain of architectural design FABEL has chosen the approach of Prof. Haller and Ludger Hovestadt to a cooperative, structured process of building design, supported by modern software tools. This approach has its origin in the architectural work of Fritz Haller <ref> [ Haller, 1988 ] </ref> , especially the component based building system MIDI [ Haller, 1974 ] for multi-storey buildings with complex installations like schools, laboratories or office buildings.

Reference-contexts: But this is the only common feature the two approaches have. Structural adaptation applies the adaptation rules directly to the solution stored in a case. In CHEF, for example, the adaptation rules modify the recipe according to the users feedback <ref> [ Hammond, 1989 ] </ref> . On the other hand, there is derivational adaptation. The core idea here is not only to store a solution but the sequence of applied operators that constructed this solution.

Reference-contexts: Nor will image recognition techniques (e.g. <ref> [ Hartmann, 1982 ] </ref> , [ Niemann, 1990 ] ), as we have more than mere images: we know the objects they are composed of and their semantics, e.g. the subsystem an object belongs to, its cost, material, scale, time of creation, or function.

Reference-contexts: The research of Treisman [ Treisman, 1982 ] und [ Treisman, 1985 ] confirms the cognitive relevance of this approach. Maybe focusing can be guided by additional knowledge about interesting constellations and perception rules. (See the results of gestalt psychology in <ref> [ Helson, 1933 ] </ref> or [ Zusne, 1970 ] .) Currently, we are examining whether the MAX system ( [ Rome, 1992 ] and [ Rome, 1993 ] ) developed at GMD within the TASSO project can be used to focus on object groups.

Reference-contexts: This reflects the principle of locality in the multidimensional design space of DANCER. Locality is a key idea of both, ASM and DANCER. ASM is completely described in <ref> [ Henne, 1990 ] </ref> ; more general explanations of associative networks can be found in [ Kratzer, 1990 ] and [ Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986 ] , for example. 2.4 Comparison The author does not know any other system which uses specialized neuronal networks for organizing a case memory for retrieval <p> Nearest-neighbour methods from statistics can be found in [ Duda and Hart, 1973 ] or [ Fix and Hodges, 1951 ] .

The feature vectors as input nodes are associated to layout fragments at the output nodes. The result is an unorderd list of "exactly matching" or "partial-matching" layout fragments, the kind of matching being controled by a parameter.

Reference-contexts: Cases refer to semantic general knowledge sources and similarity assessment is modeled in a hybrid system architecture in which both kinds of knowledge are used to the same extent. In cognitive psychology for example the EVENTS system by <ref> [ Hoernig et al., 1993 ] </ref> proposes an approach that models similarity assessment of episodes (which can be seen as cases) as a combination of episodic and semantic knowledge sources.

Reference-contexts: In particular for planar graphs as we have in our domain, we know algorithms which are computable in worst case in O (n 2 ) time [ Read and Corneil, 1977 ] <ref> [ Hopcroft and Wong, 1974 ] </ref> . 8.5.2 Knowledge base We have introduced our approach as a knowledge-intensive hybrid system architecture for similarity assessment. According to this the knowledge base consists of an episodic and a semantic part: The case library and the concept-network. <p> The result is a partially ordered set of fragments with structurally similar graphs. Relevant to this approach are graph algorithms as described in [ Preparata and Shamos, 1985 ] , in <ref> [ Hopcroft and Wong, 1974 ] </ref> for planar graphs, or in [ Read and 116 10.5 HOW TO COMPARE THE APPROACHES?

Reference-contexts: CADRE deals with dimensional and to some extent topological adaptations of complete buildings, though not with their retrieval <ref> [ Hua et al., 1993 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: Like those it does not explicitly search for spatial interdependencies as most recent approaches <ref> [ IEEE, 1992 ] </ref> do.

Therefore it is less complex than approaches which first have to identify structural elements.

Reference-contexts: There are a lot of approaches to analogy which take this view. Some of the basic assumptions of such approaches were supported from a psychological point of view by [ Knauff and Schlieder, 1993 ] . In recent years these fixed-description approaches were criticized especially by Indurkhya and O'Hara <ref> [ Indurkhya, 1992 ] </ref> [ O'Hara, 1992 ] [ O'Hara and Indurk-hya, 1993 ] . Both argued that the mechanism underlying such creative analogies is representational change [ Indurkhya, 1992 ] , or redescription [ O'Hara, 1992 ] . <p> In recent years these fixed-description approaches were criticized especially by Indurkhya and O'Hara <ref> [ Indurkhya, 1992 ] </ref> [ O'Hara, 1992 ] [ O'Hara and Indurk-hya, 1993 ] . Both argued that the mechanism underlying such creative analogies is representational change [ Indurkhya, 1992 ] , or redescription [ O'Hara, 1992 ] .

What he calls the "Interaction view of cognition" belongs to one of the most widely discussed issues in human perception research since more than five decades. <p> issue: he emphasizes that both data-driven and concept-driven processes involve groupings: the perceptual apparatus makes many different "interpretations" of the same sensory data, (may be dependent from the context) and the cognitive system makes different connections between the same sensory data and different symbolically represented concepts and vice versa ( <ref> [ Indurkhya, 1992 ] </ref> 1 This chapter is an extended version of on earlier paper published in [ Knauff and Schlieder, 1993 ] 85 86 8.2 DERIVED REPRESENTATION p.180.) Numerous empirical results support this hypothesis. Therefore, when speaking of analogy, as in [ Indurkhya, 1992 ] it is important to take <p> different symbolically represented concepts and vice versa ( <ref> [ Indurkhya, 1992 ] </ref> 1 This chapter is an extended version of on earlier paper published in [ Knauff and Schlieder, 1993 ] 85 86 8.2 DERIVED REPRESENTATION p.180.) Numerous empirical results support this hypothesis. Therefore, when speaking of analogy, as in [ Indurkhya, 1992 ] it is important to take into account that humans assess similarity in different ways. 8.2 Derived representation We use three kinds of case representation formats: the first is called Positional Object Representation (POS) and represents all information required to generate a pixel representation (cf. figure 8.1). <p> This is different with the following interpretations. Terms: To encode structural knowledge, e.g. case-based knowledge about spatial arrangement and relative positions of objects in a machine-usable form, we need a more elaborated case representation. Influenced by the work of Bipin Indurkhya and Scott O'Hara (cf. <ref> [ Indurkhya, 1991; Indurkhya, 1992; O'Hara, 1992 ] </ref> ) we represent the complex structures of related objects as terms over some appropriately tailored signature.

Our working hypothesis predicts that the analysis of performance data from psychological experiments should show whether a set of preferred operator sequences can be identified, that is, sequences which people use as standard, default solutions when they are confronted with a construction task.

Feature vectors (1) are the standard representation in case-based reasoning (cf. [ Ries-beck and Schank, 1989 ] , [ Bareiss, 1991 ] , or <ref> [ Kolodner, 1993 ] </ref> ). Originally, we planned to use it for semantic attributes only. In one approach, we use the number of objects in a layout fragment, different joins of semantical attributes and the width and height of the occupied area to characterize a layout fragment.

Reference-contexts: Indurkhya's contribution is to emphasize the importance of the application of grouping principles in geometrical similarity assessment. On the other hand he did not propose a computational approach and in O'Hara's algorithm continuity is only used implicitly as a grouping principle <ref> [ O'Hara and Indurkhya, 1993 ] </ref> . <p> One may therefore ask whether the grouping algorithm extends naturally to problems where shape is a dominant factor. Shape properties seem to be central to the kind of analogical reasoning tasks that are studied by <ref> [ O'Hara and Indurkhya, 1993 ] </ref> . These tasks are of the type A is to B as C to X where A, B, and C are geometrical figures given as line drawings and X is a figure to be constructed. <p> Each choice corresponds to a well-defined grouping principle which describes a fundamental reorganization of the representation at the level of primitives. This strategy is so general that it encompasses the problem encountered by <ref> [ O'Hara and Indurkhya, 1993 ] </ref> , that is the identification of primitive objects in a line drawing. It may be necessary however, to consider further principles besides proximity and similarity in this domain where shape plays an important role. <p> In this section we describe the implementation of the bottom-up grouping process and discuss its most relevant properties. Afterwards we compare it to the proposal presented in <ref> [ O'Hara and Indurkhya, 1993 ] </ref> and discuss some theoretical implications of our approach. 8.3.4.1 The neighbourhood graph The neighbourhood-graph describes the spatial neighbourhood relations of the objects of a diagram. In our example we use a very simple location of objects: All objects are located on a discrete grid.

Reference-contexts: Some of the basic assumptions of such approaches were supported from a psychological point of view by [ Knauff and Schlieder, 1993 ] . In recent years these fixed-description approaches were criticized especially by Indurkhya and O'Hara [ Indurkhya, 1992 ] <ref> [ O'Hara, 1992 ] </ref> [ O'Hara and Indurk-hya, 1993 ] . Both argued that the mechanism underlying such creative analogies is representational change [ Indurkhya, 1992 ] , or redescription [ O'Hara, 1992 ] . <p> In recent years these fixed-description approaches were criticized especially by Indurkhya and O'Hara [ Indurkhya, 1992 ] <ref> [ O'Hara, 1992 ] </ref> [ O'Hara and Indurk-hya, 1993 ] . Both argued that the mechanism underlying such creative analogies is representational change [ Indurkhya, 1992 ] , or redescription [ O'Hara, 1992 ] . The key idea of these approaches is a process by which new points of view can be created and these redescriptions can be useful for the matching process. <p> Both authors focus on geometric proportional analogies (proportional analogies have the form A is to B, as C is to D) and <ref> [ O'Hara, 1992 ] </ref> describes a computer program called PAN, which redescribes geometric figures by analogical problem solving. * Usually the case that is found will not be an exact match. There will be numerous differences between the current input problem and the stored solution. <p> Using attribute-based representations to encode this knowledge is difficult or even impossible. Other representations are needed. Influenced by the work of Bipin Indurkhya (cf. [ Indurkhya, 1991; Indurkhya, 1992 ] ) and (cf. Scott E. O'Hara <ref> [ O'Hara, 1992 ] </ref> ) we want to give a framework to represent structural knowledge. Cases will be represented as terms over some appropriately tailored signature. Additionally, knowledge about cases and their relations will be formalized to represent rule-based background knowledge about possible case modifications. <p> This task allocation corresponds to the different structures of return and fresh air supply nets. SynTerm and SynGraph will be integrated in the 2nd FABEL-Prototype. 6.4 Comparison This approach was strongly inspired by the work of Bipin Indurkhya and Scott E. O'Hara (cf. <ref> [ Indurkhya, 1991; Indurkhya, 1992; O'Hara, 1992 ] </ref> ). 4 An introduction into the transfer of the approach to graph based representations can be found in [ Borner et al., 1993a ] . <p> We will come back to this point later and discuss how useful a representation of these default sequences can be particularly in the context of representational indeterminacy <ref> [ O'Hara, 1992 ] </ref> . 92 8.3 SIMILARITY CONCEPT 8.3.1.3 Grouping principles When humans see the world, they do not see just a collection of edges and blobs, like low-level descriptions, but see instead an organized world of objects and relations among them. <p> Figure 8.12 depicts what can be considered as the simplest order: the primitive is translated, and the result is translated again, a total of four times. The combinatorial explosion of application orders poses a serious challenge to a proposal made by <ref> [ O'Hara, 1992 ] </ref> . He suggested relying on a normal form in order to deal with composition indeterminacy. His PAN algorithm uses normal form representations to solve the kind of geometrical analogy problems mentioned earlier. <p> The other operators appear as inner nodes, without their position being subject to further constraints (cf. figure 8.13). As <ref> [ O'Hara, 1992 ] </ref> observes himself, this normal form does not eliminate all indeterminacy. In fact, any of the 120 possible ways of constructing the horizontal row will be in normal form. Figure 8.13 shows the representation for the application order 1-3-2-5-4. <p> This is different with the following interpretations. Terms: To encode structural knowledge, e.g. case-based knowledge about spatial arrangement and relative positions of objects in a machine-usable form, we need a more elaborated case representation. Influenced by the work of Bipin Indurkhya and Scott O'Hara (cf. <ref> [ Indurkhya, 1991; Indurkhya, 1992; O'Hara, 1992 ] </ref> ) we represent the complex structures of related objects as terms over some appropriately tailored signature. The formal definition can be found in [ Borner, 1993b; Borner, 1993a ] .

Reference-contexts: In geometric models similarity of two objects a and b is a monotonic function of the distance between their representations in a multidimensional space <ref> [ Ortony, 1979 ] </ref> . The most severe problem with such approaches is that they cannot deal with asymmetry of similarity judgements.

Reference-contexts: In these respects, our work is quite unique. Since the methods are generic, we expect them to be applicable to arbitrary CAD-layout databases. [ Wendel, 1993 ] or <ref> [ Perner, 1993 ] </ref> are examples of trying to catch structures from images (neural activity plots and ultrasonic images, resp.).

For a neighbourhhood-graph of bounded degree k the worst case complexity is O (n fl k). <p> In the best matching class, the query graphs are further matched with its individual members taking into account their labe-lings. The result is a partially ordered set of fragments with structurally similar graphs.

Reference-contexts: MAX realizes a grouping according to perception laws of gestalt psychology. In addition, focusing could be controlled by the objects. In accordance with the model of pattern recognition in the visual cortex, specific regularities in the image could lead to a "synchronization" of the related objects (cf. <ref> [ Reitbock, 1993 ] </ref> ). On the other hand, we discuss using sketching itself for the focusing. The idea is to sketch the whole case or problem and to examine only those parts in more detail, where "structure" strikes. 7.3.2 Properties Indexing with gestalts is totally defined.

The implementation of this case memory was inspired by PATDEX <ref> [ Richter and Wess, 1991 ] </ref> which also uses attribute-value pairs to represent a case. The domain of PATDEX is the diagnosis of numerically controlled machine failures which are characterized by certain symptoms. So in this domain attributes are called symptoms and the attribute-value pairs are called observations.

Reference-contexts: In psychology Tulving [ Tulving, 1972 ] emphasized the distinction between semantic and episodic memory and if one takes a look at the research on human memory it is not surprising that CBR has been proposed as a psychologically more plausible model of reasoning than rule-based reasoning systems <ref> [ Riesbeck and Schank, 1989 ] </ref> . Since any CBR system involves case selection, retrieval and adaptation one of the most crucial research issues is to face the question of which situation (which case represented in the case library) is similar to the new situation. <p> There will be numerous differences between the current input problem and the stored solution. So the case-based reasoner has to apply adaptation rules that take those differences into account Fabel-Report No. 13 3 <ref> [ Riesbeck and Schank, 1989 ] </ref> . In the last several years, in principle two different kinds of adaptation have been described in the CBR-community. Both of them apply adaptation rules to the retrieved solution. But this is the only common feature the two approaches have. <p> For readers who are interested in a short overview of methods of similarity assessment we recommend the following books or articles: [ Gregson, 1975 ] [ Vosniadou and Ortony, 1989 ] <ref> [ Riesbeck and Schank, 1989 ] </ref> [ We et al., 1992 ] [ Medin et al., 1993 ] [ Kolodner, 1993 ] . <p> For layout, spatial aspects play an eminent role. Thus, retrieval and case-based reasoning methods suited for data records or texts will not do (see [ Salton and McGill, 1983 ] or [ Gebhardt, 1981 ] for surveys of information retrieval, <ref> [ Riesbeck and Schank, 1989 ] </ref> or [ Kolodner, 1993 ] for surveys of case-based reasoning, [ Medin et al., 1993 ] or [ Gregson, 1975 ] for psychological perspectives).

Similar to <ref> [ Rome, 1992 ] </ref> , we mean by gestalt a group of objects that are spatially perceived as a whole. Gestalts represent very condensed and meaningful information that is enormously useful for retrieval.

The regions scaled to one pixel overlap. The last step classifies the grey-values by overlapping intervals like <ref> [ Rosenfeld, 1969 ] </ref> (pp. 127 - 153).

Reference-contexts: Similarity judgements are considered as being a valuable tool in the study of human perception and cognition and play a central role in theories of human knowledge representation, behavior, and problem solving. "It serves as an organizing principle by which individuals classify objects, form concepts, and make generalizations" [ <ref> [ Tversky, 1977 ] </ref> , p. 327]. 2 CONTENTS CBR is concerned with three central problems : how to define an adequate case representation, how to recognize and retrieve similar cases and to find the best way to adapt solutions of retrieved cases. * The case representation problem is involved in <p> The most severe problem with such approaches is that they cannot deal with asymmetry of similarity judgements. Another famous approach is given by the Tversky-Contrast-model <ref> [ Tversky, 1977 ] </ref> which assesses similarity between two cases by counting the number of matching and mismatching features that the two cases have. There are numerous problems, since the importance of features often changes depending on the problem. <p> The concept of similarity computation is also based on some ideas of Tversky <ref> [ Tversky, 1977 ] </ref> . <p> The result is an unorderd list of "exactly matching" or "partial-matching" layout fragments, the kind of matching being controled by a parameter. Ordering of the result is not yet implemented, but could be done easily by using a kind of "Tversky" similarity measure <ref> [ Tversky, 1977 ] </ref> . In the domain of architecture and CAD drawings, no similar approach for retrieving layout fragments is known to us. Bitmaps of different resolution are stored in a hierarchy. Associated with each node is the unordered set of fragments with the bitmap of the node.

Reference-contexts: The idea of pin-graphs (cf. [ Hofting et al., 1992 ] ) may be embedded in this concept if a node of the basic graph G (V; E) is replaced by a small separately defined graph.

There are layouts representing by unconnected graphs, either we insert man-made edges connecting these components or we investigate the graphs separately.

Reference-contexts: Nor do we know of any approaches, neither in case-based reasoning nor for image databases, that retrieve CAD-like drawings other than by feature vectors.

There are two approaches that are related to ours because they are concenred with an architectural domain.
