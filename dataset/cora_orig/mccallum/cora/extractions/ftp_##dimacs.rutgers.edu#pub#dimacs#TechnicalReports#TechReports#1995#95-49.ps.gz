Reference-contexts: Two segments are said to cross each other if they have an interior point in common. It appears to be difficult to obtain any exact results analogous to Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 for pairwise crossing edges. It follows from <ref> [AEG94] </ref> that if we color the edges of a complete geometric graph of 12n 2 vertices by two colors, one can always find n pairwise crossing edges of the same color, but the assertion is probably true for much smaller graphs. In [LMP94], the following question was discussed.

Reference-contexts: R v (G) and R e (G) are called the vertex and edge Ramsey number of G, respectively. Clearly, we have R v (G) R (G) ; 2 : (For abstract graphs, a similar notion is dicussed in [EFR78] and <ref> [B83] </ref>.) It follows from the previous subsection that for P n , the class of non-selfintersecting paths of length n, R v (P n ) = O (n 2 ) and R e (P n ) = O (n 4 ): It is not difficult to improve the latter bound, as

Reference-contexts: Most questions of this type can be generalized to complete geometric graphs, where the monochromatic subgraphs are required to satisfy certain geometric conditions. Our first two theorems settle two problems raised by A. Bialostocki and P. Dierker <ref> [BD94] </ref>. Theorem 1.1 If the edges of a finite complete geometric graph are colored by two colors, there exists a non-selfintersecting spanning tree, all of whose edges are of the same color.

Reference-contexts: The n segments determined by n points in the plane, no three of which are collinear, form a complete geometric graph with n vertices (see [PA95]).

Reference-contexts: The length of a path is the number of its edges. Let P n denote the class of all non-selfintersecting paths of length n. To give a non-trivial upper bound on R (P k ; P l ), we recall the following wellknown (and very easy) lemma of Dilworth <ref> [D50] </ref>. Lemma 4.2 Any partially ordered set of size kl + 1 either has a totally ordered subset of size k + 1 or contains l + 1 pairwise incomparable elements.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1.2 If the edges of a complete geometric graph with 3n 1 vertices are colored by two colors, there exist n pairwise disjoint edges of the same color.

In fact, Gerencser and Gyarfas proved the stronger result that for any 2-coloring of the edges of a complete graph with 3n 1 vertices, there exists a monochromatic path of length 2n 1. <p> Take the disjoint union of a complete graph of n 1 vertices and a complete graph of 2n 1 vertices, all of whose edges are red and blue, respectively, and color all edges between the two parts red.

Reference-contexts: An i-element subset of P is called an i-set if it can be obtained by intersecting P with an open half-plane. It is easy to see that all i-sets can be generated by the following procedure <ref> [ELS73] </ref>: Take an oriented line ` passing through precisely one point p 2 P and having i elements of P on its left side. Rotate ` around p in the clockwise direction until it hits another point q 2 P , and then continue the rotation around q, etc.
