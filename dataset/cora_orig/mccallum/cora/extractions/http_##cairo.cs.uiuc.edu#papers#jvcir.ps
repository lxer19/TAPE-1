Reference-contexts: Franklin and Reiter [15] provided a fair exchange protocol which enables two parties to exchange secrets with fairness so that neither of the parties can gain an information advantage by quitting prematurely or otherwise misbehaving. A "semi-trusted" third party is used to facilitate the exchange. Asokan, Schunter, and Waidner <ref> [2] </ref> presented optimistic protocols for fair exchange of electronic data with non-repudiation. These protocols do not involve a third party during a faultless exchange but do require one during their recovery.

Reference-contexts: Gong [17] developed techniques which construct authentication protocols on the basis of one-way functions rather than encryption algorithms. Equally simple and capable protocols were achieved 6 in comparison with either public-key or private-key encryption algorithms. Bellare et al <ref> [3] </ref> proposed a family of protocols - iKP for secure electronic payments over the Internet. The protocols involve three parties: the customer who makes the payment, the merchant who receives the payment, and a gateway which connects the electronic world with the existing payment infrastructure and authorizes the transactions.

Reference-contexts: Below, we consider currently available techniques in these areas. In 1988, Steiner, Neuman and Schiller [26] from MIT designed Kerberos. Kerberos is a network authentication system used on physically insecure networks. It is based on the key distribution model presented by Needham and Schroeder [21]. Bellovin and Merritt <ref> [4] </ref> discussed a number of limitations and weaknesses of the Kerberos system and presented solutions to some of them.

For example, Abadi and Needham [1] presented several principles on designing security protocols. <p> How to make Step 2 secure is not the focus here.

Reference-contexts: These schemes are easily defeated by filtering, redigitization, geometric distortion, cropping, requantization, etc. Bender, Gruhl, and Morimoto <ref> [5] </ref> discuss two different approaches to watermarking: (1) Patchwork, and (2) Texture Block Coding.

Reference-contexts: However, because of the use of least significant bits, the identification code can be easily destroyed. There are many other proposals for watermarking such as Tanaka's schemes [30] which use the fact that the quantization noise is typically imperceptible to users, Brassil's methods <ref> [7] </ref> for textual document images, and Caronni's geometric patterns (also called tags) [9]. These schemes are easily defeated by filtering, redigitization, geometric distortion, cropping, requantization, etc. Bender, Gruhl, and Morimoto [5] discuss two different approaches to watermarking: (1) Patchwork, and (2) Texture Block Coding.

Reference-contexts: However, because the choice of the frequency set is not based on any perceptual significance and the variance of the frequency coefficients is small, this method may be sensitive to noise or distortions. It is also vulnerable to multiple-document attacks a . Cox, Kilian, Leighton, and Shamoon <ref> [11] </ref> argue that a watermark must be placed in perceptually significant components of a signal if it is to be robust to common signal distortions and attacks. <p> In doing so, the original information, which was changed by the preprocessing, will never be exposed. 4.2 Raw-Image-Based Non-Invertible Watermarking Scheme By applying the similar idea discussed in Section 4.1, we can give a modified version of the scheme described by Cox et al <ref> [11] </ref>: ALGORITHM 2 Given an original image V , let us choose a key KEY .

Reference-contexts: Certainly, most of them can be modified so that they can resolve the rightful ownership. For a more complete review of watermark techniques, we refer the readers to Cox and Miller's work in <ref> [12] </ref>. 2.2 Related Work on General Security Issues Until now, watermarking schemes involved only the owner of the video/image information. The owner had complete control of the watermark construction, insertion of watermark into video/image, and its verification.

Reference-contexts: The watermark schemes should also be robust against multiple-document attacks. However, there are still open problems. One of them, as pointed out by Craver et al <ref> [13] </ref>, is how to resolve the rightful ownership of the invisible watermarking schemes. Craver et al attacked existing watermarking techniques by providing counterfeit watermarking schemes that can be performed on a watermarked image to allow multiple claims of ownerships. We refer to their attack as the CMYY attack. <p> Craver, Memon, Yeo, and Yeung <ref> [13] </ref> address an important issue of rightful ownership. They provide counterfeit watermarking schemes that can be performed on a watermarked image to allow multiple claims of rightful ownerships. We will refer to this attack as the CMYY attack. We will discuss this topic in detail in the next section. <p> Otherwise, (E, D, C) is (weakly d ) non-invertible. 2 Definition 1 comes from the Craver's paper <ref> [13] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: They introduce new data hiding schemes whose parameters can be adjusted with the capacity, imperceptibility, and robustness. Koch, Rindfrey, and Zhao <ref> [14] </ref> present an image watermarking method. The image is grouped into 8x8 blocks and each 8x8 block is DCT transformed.

Reference-contexts: They developed a number of principles for the design of authentication metrics, demonstrated why several proposed metrics fall short, and described a new metric that comes close to being an acceptable metric of authentication. Franklin and Reiter <ref> [15] </ref> provided a fair exchange protocol which enables two parties to exchange secrets with fairness so that neither of the parties can gain an information advantage by quitting prematurely or otherwise misbehaving. A "semi-trusted" third party is used to facilitate the exchange.

Reference-contexts: Using their methodology, signature systems can be designed which allow certain types of image modification but prevent other types from manipulation. They also propose an extension of the authentication system towards video. Langelaar et al <ref> [16] </ref> propose two image watermarking methods. The first one extends the existing spatial labeling technique which adds a positive integer constant k to the brightness of 50% of the pixels in an image. This constant k is called the label embedding level. <p> In this section, we will first derive such a scheme which applies to the MPEG-encoded video streams and then derive another one for raw image or uncompressed video stream. The watermark embedding methods are similar to the methods of Langelaar et al <ref> [16] </ref> and Hartung and Girod [19] in the sense of applying DCT to the watermark.

Reference-contexts: These protocols do not involve a third party during a faultless exchange but do require one during their recovery. Zhou and Gollmann [34] also presented a fair non-repudiation protocol which requires a Trusted Third Party but the involvement of the Trusted Third Party is minimized. Gong <ref> [17] </ref> developed techniques which construct authentication protocols on the basis of one-way functions rather than encryption algorithms. Equally simple and capable protocols were achieved 6 in comparison with either public-key or private-key encryption algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The second method removes high frequency DCT-coefficients in some areas to embed a label. However, this method may remove too many DCT-coefficients therefore cause distortions. Hartung and Girod <ref> [19] </ref> provide a watermarking scheme specifically for MPEG encoded video. The basic idea is to apply DCT to each of 8x8 blocks of the watermark and then add the DCT coefficients of the watermark to the corresponding DCT coefficients of MPEG stream. <p> In this section, we will first derive such a scheme which applies to the MPEG-encoded video streams and then derive another one for raw image or uncompressed video stream. The watermark embedding methods are similar to the methods of Langelaar et al [16] and Hartung and Girod <ref> [19] </ref> in the sense of applying DCT to the watermark.

Reference-contexts: In addition to our technical solutions, standardization and legislative procedures for watermarking and its verification process are important for solving the global copyright protection problems. The standardization organization and the legislative bodies will need to limit the choices of encryption functions within the well-known standards such as DES, IDEA <ref> [20] </ref>, RC4; and the choices of eligible watermarking procedures within non-invertible schemes in order to enforce the copyright control and prevent, avoid, and detect illegal transactions of copyrighted multimedia data.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we present solutions to both problems described above: 1 ) We present watermarking methods which resolve the rightful ownership and are successful against the CMYY attack. We introduce requirements on the watermark construction algorithm which include (1) using a standard encryption function such as DES <ref> [22] </ref>, and (2) using the original image/video or other known bit stream information during the construction process. Because of these requirements, the non-invertibility of our proposed scheme is easily proved.

Reference-contexts: The watermark consists of 1000 randomly generated numbers. The length of the watermark is variable and can be adjusted to suit the characteristics of the data. Schneider and Chang <ref> [24] </ref> present a methodology for designing content based digital signatures which can be used to authenticate images. Using their methodology, signature systems can be designed which allow certain types of image modification but prevent other types from manipulation. They also propose an extension of the authentication system towards video.

Reference-contexts: The auto-correlation of the image results in the recovery of the shape of the region. This method is limited to those images with a lot of textures. Smith and Comiskey <ref> [25] </ref> discuss the characteristics of the data hiding schemes, such as the amount of information that can be hidden, the perceptibility, the robustness which is modeled using the quantities of channel, the signal-to-noise ratio, and the jamming margin.

Reference-contexts: These protocols require that all involved parties are authenticated properly, all messages are transmitted securely, and all evidence can not be repudiated.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, for the applications where the owner is undisputed or the ownership problem is not important, the Self-Proof Class schemes are still useful. Another attempt to resolve the ownership problem is provided by Wolfgang and Delp <ref> [33] </ref>. Their method uses timestamps to generate the watermark. The owner with the earliest timestamp is the true owner. However, this scheme can be easily defeated because timestamps can be manipulated. For example, the time of an event, such as "the Berlin Wall came down", is well-known.

Reference-contexts: A "semi-trusted" third party is used to facilitate the exchange.
