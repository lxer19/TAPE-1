Abstract: This paper reports on the modelling and solution of a large industrial combinatorial optimization problem using the ECL i PS e Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) platform. The problem is fleet assignment: the assignment of a set of aircraft of different types to a predefined shedule of flights. A single underlying model was developed and solved in ECL i PS e . Three optimization methods were applied in three stages of model development and solution. The three methods were used to meet different objectives. The first was depth first search branch and bound optimization in conjunction with Finite Domain propagation. This straightforward approach was used to develop and validate the model in the ECL i PS e platform. The second was mixed integer programming. The CLP model and solutions were exported to a mathematical solver and used to produce a globally optimal solution. Knowing the optimal solution is desirable, however obtaining good solutions close to the user's actual assignment is more useful in practice. The third method used a repair-based extension of the first approach, and obtained high quality solutions close to the user's assignment. This multistage devolopment process resulted in the end user commissioning the development of an ECL i PS e -based application combining repair with Finite Domain propagation, with the purpose of improving their day to day fleet assignment process.

Reference-contexts: Localising Propagation Localising the scope of propagation is possible by labelling those variables in constraints that connect separable portions of the constraint graph <ref> [KK88] </ref>. In the BA fleet assignment the constraint graph may be decomposed into relatively independent subgraphs, corresponding to the stations of the problem, by labelling the overnight variables; these exist in all the constraints linking stations.

Reference-contexts: Tong el al. also report this defficiency for global constraints and suggests the use of constrained generators to satisfy them, while applying constraint propagation for the remainder of the problem <ref> [TBMV92] </ref>. According to Tong et al., a global constraint is one that ranges over a large number of variables without achieving much useful propagation. Constrained generators are procedures which repair an existing solution or modify it such that a global constraint is made redundant.
