Abstract: We discuss iterative methods for solving the algebraic systems of equations arising from linearization and discretization of primitive variable formulations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Implicit discretization in time leads to a coupled but linear system of partial differential equations at each time step, and discretization in space then produces a series of linear algebraic systems. We give an overview of commonly used time and space discretization techniques, and we discuss a variety of algorithmic strategies for solving the resulting systems of equations. The emphasis is on preconditioning techniques, which can be combined with Krylov subspace iterative methods. In many cases the solution of subsidiary problems such as the discrete convection-diffusion equation and the discrete Stokes equations plays a crucial role. We examine iterative techniques for these problems and show how they can be integrated into effective solution algorithms for the Navier-Stokes equations. fl Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA, e-mail: elman@cs.umd.edu.

Reference-contexts: Assuming uniform timesteps t = T =n for ease of exposition, the simplest two-stage (Peaceman-Rachford) scheme [39] is given below. Algorithm 1.1.

The simplest time-stepping approach for the Navier-Stokes equations is a simple one-stage finite difference discretisation. A generic (and unconditionally stable) algorithm (cf. Algorithms 1.1 and 1.2) is given below. Algorithm 1.3. Given u 0 , 2 <ref> [1=2; 1] </ref>, find u 1 , u 2 , : : :, u n via (u n+1 u n ) + u fl ru n+ r 2 u n+ + rp n+ = 0 u n+ = g n+ on @:(1.11) Here u n+ = u n+1 + (1 )u n <p> The classical analysis of the stationary method (3.2) proceeds as follows; see <ref> [1, 48, 52] </ref> for comprehensive presentations of these results and [34, 47] for concise overviews. Let e (k) = u u (k) denote the error at the kth step of the stationary iteration (3.2). <p> Consequently, ae is referred to as the convergence factor. The effectiveness of Krylov subspace methods depends in large part on the existence of a polynomial that takes on the values 1 at the origin and is small on the eigenvalues of Q 1 A = I Q 1 R <ref> [1, 41] </ref>; thus, it is also desirable to make ae (Q 1 R) as small as possible for Krylov sub-space methods. 3.1. Analysis of convergence factors. <p> Analysis of convergence factors. We first consider versions of the classical Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel and successive over-relaxation (SOR) iterative methods and discuss analytic bounds on convergence factors for these methods. Throughout our discussion, we will use the two-dimensional version of (2.1); see <ref> [1, 34, 47, 48, 52] </ref> for general presentations. Let denote the unit square (0; 1) fi (0; 1) and assume the discretisation is performed on a uniform grid using finite differences or linear or tri-linear finite elements. <p> Assume that F is normalized to have unit diagonal, so that it can be represented as F = tri <ref> [ b; 1; c ] </ref> : In addition, assume b + c = 1 (needed for a consistent discretisation) and b &gt; 0, c &gt; 0 (for a nonoscillatory solution [25]). We say that the discrete problem is convection-dominated if b is large, i.e., close to 1.

Reference-contexts: Example 1: P = diag (A) and M is any suitable choice (such as diag (Q)) which satisfies (4.5).

Reference-contexts: Operator splitting Methods. One attractive approach ensuring stabil-ity and high accuracy is to decouple the convection and incompressibility operators using an "alternating-direction" splitting; see Glowinski & Dean <ref> [5] </ref>. Assuming uniform timesteps t = T =n for ease of exposition, the simplest two-stage (Peaceman-Rachford) scheme [39] is given below. Algorithm 1.1. <p> Second order accuracy can be achieved by setting u fl = u n+ , but in this case a nonlinear convection-diffusion problem (1.5) must be solved at every time level, in addition to the generalised Stokes problem (1.6). The Peaceman-Rachford splitting method has one drawback (see <ref> [5] </ref> and [46]), namely, that it is not asymptotically stable when applied to the standard model problem with an exponentially decaying solution. Thus we can expect any implementation of Algorithm 1.1 to perform poorly if the time-step is not small enough when the underlying flow exhibits fast transient behaviour. <p> In addition, the methodology is not well suited to computing steady-state flow solutions by "pseudo-timestepping" with large timesteps. Motivated by these observations, Glowinski <ref> [5] </ref> proposed a three-stage variant of the Peaceman-Rachford scheme which has all the good features of the original method whilst retaining stability in the asymptotic limit t ! 1. The resulting method is commonly referred to as "Le -scheme". Algorithm 1.2. <p> ; u n+1 u n+ fir 2 u n+1 + : : : u n+1 = g n+1 on @:(1.8) u n+1 u n+1 ffr 2 u n+1 + : : : r u n+1 = 0 in ; The nonlinear scheme u fl = u n+1 is considered in <ref> [5] </ref>, and requires the solution of two generalised Stokes problems (1.7),(1.9), and one nonlinear convection-diffusion equation (1.8) at each time step. In this case, either choosing ff=fi = 1=2 or else setting = 1 1= 2 with ff + fi = 1 gives second order accuracy as t ! 0. <p> In particular, setting = 1 1= p 2, ff = (1 2)=(1 ) and fi = =(1 ) gives a method which is second order accurate in time, unconditionally stable, has good asymptotic properties and has commonality between the coefficient matrices at the various substages, see <ref> [5] </ref>. The unconditional stability of the scheme in an incompressible Navier-Stokes setting was established by Kloucek & Rys [31]. In [46] a linear -scheme is developed which retains second order accuracy (setting u fl = u n+ in Algorithm 1.2 reduces the accuracy to first order).

Reference-contexts: The spatial discretisations of the convection-diffusion and Stokes subproblems which arise above are discussed in section 2. If is small then an efficient alternative to operator-splitting is to use the "characteristics" of the associated hyperbolic problem (looking backwards in time to ensure stability), see Douglas & Russell <ref> [6] </ref>. Using this approach a single Stokes problem of the form (1.6) must be solved at every time-level so the discussion in section 4 is also relevant to this class of methods. 1.2.

Reference-contexts: F is a discrete vector convection-diffusion operator and B represents the coupling between the discrete velocity u and the pressure p. For simplicity of presentation we only present results for the unstabilised case S = 0. 5.1. Preconditioning I: Convection-diffusion solves. We first describe two preconditioning techniques developed in <ref> [7] </ref> that generalise the methods of section 4 essentially by replacing the approximation P to the vector Laplacian operator in (4.3) with an approximation to the vector convection-diffusion operator F . It is easiest to describe the ideas using the exact operator F . <p> This is proved <ref> [7] </ref> by bounding the eigenvalues of the symmetric part of BF 1 B t (with respect to 1 Q) and the skew-symmetric part of BF 1 B t , and then applying Bendix-son's theorem ([47], p. 418). But fl and are independent of the mesh size h of the discretisation. <p> Experimental results for both GMRES and the quasi-minimal residual method (QMR) [20] indicate that this analysis is predictive for arbitrary initial guesses, i.e., the triangular method requires roughly half the iterations to converge <ref> [7] </ref>. Moreover, the inverse of the block triangular preconditioner can be expressed in factored form as 0 1 ! 1 0 I I B t ! 0 Q 1 ; so that the only overhead associated with using (5.4) instead of (5.2) is a matrix multiplication by B t . <p> The initial guess was identically zero and the stopping criterion was fl fl fl f ! B 0 u k ! fl fl fl fl fl 0 fl fl 2 These results, which come from <ref> [7] </ref>, indicate that the iteration counts are independent of the mesh size. (This is less evident for the smallest value = 1=100 considered here; we believe that this is because finer meshes are needed for the asymptotic behavior to be displayed in this case.) See [7] for additional experimental results. 5.2. <p> These results, which come from <ref> [7] </ref>, indicate that the iteration counts are independent of the mesh size. (This is less evident for the smallest value = 1=100 considered here; we believe that this is because finer meshes are needed for the asymptotic behavior to be displayed in this case.) See [7] for additional experimental results. 5.2. Preconditioning II: Stokes solves. An alternative approach considered in [23] builds on the ideas of section 4 in a different way, by using a symmetric operator as a preconditioner for the Oseen equations. <p> This is seen in the lower bound of 2 for the real parts of the eigenvalues in Theorem 5.1 (which is shown to be tight in <ref> [7] </ref>) and the upper bound of 1= in Theorem 5.3. In both cases the iteration counts appear to grow linearly in 1=, and therefore we expect these ideas to be most suitable problems with relatively high viscosity, i.e., low Reynolds numbers. 6.

Reference-contexts: In this section we will develop the theory and present computational results for only one class of method, namely those based on preconditioned Minimum Residual iteration, but see <ref> [8] </ref> for a comparison of various competitive techniques. The relevant theory for any of the alternative approaches is based on the key result (2.30) which is a direct consequence of the stability required to ensure accuracy properties of the underlying approximation.

Reference-contexts: The proof depends on the fact that the block diagonal matrix D can be symmetrized using a diagonal similarity transformation, see <ref> [11] </ref>. Theorem 3.1. <p> This is the case, for example, if centred finite differences are used to discretise the first derivatives in (2.1) on a fine enough mesh, or if upwind differencing is used <ref> [11, 12] </ref>. For example, if centred differences are used on a uniform n fi n grid with h = 1=(n + 1), then with fl = oeh=2, ffi = o h=2, Theorem 3.1 is equivalent to the following result. Corollary 3.2. <p> As above, analysis of the Gauss-Seidel and SOR methods uses (3.5) and (3.6). For the orderings of figure 4, we have the following bounds for the block Jacobi iteration matrices. The proof again depends on finding an appropriate symmetrization operator for ^ F ; see <ref> [11, 12, 13, 14] </ref> for proofs and extensive discussions of other problems and orderings. 14 Fig. 3.

Reference-contexts: But fl and are independent of the mesh size h of the discretisation. Moreover, since N and A are first-order and second-order operators, respectively, ffi is also independent of h <ref> [15] </ref>. Consequently, the box containing the gen-eralised eigenvalues of (5.3) are independent of the discretisation mesh size. A bound on the eigenvalues of the preconditioned Oseen operator is an immediate consequence. Corollary 5.2.

Reference-contexts: Such methods are generally less efficient than their symmetric counterparts (see for example <ref> [16] </ref>). In order to preserve symmetry in the preconditioned system we employ a symmetric and positive definite preconditioner M which for theoretical purposes only we factor as M = M 2 M 2 . (A Cholesky factorisation could equally be used). <p> Thus, we have the following result. Theorem 5.3. The eigenvalues of the discrete Oseen operator preconditioned by (5.4) consist of = 1 together with the generalised eigenvalues of S in (5.3). Therefore, the eigenvalues are bounded independently of h and they all have positive real part. The analysis in <ref> [16] </ref> shows that for a particular starting guess the i'th GMRES polynomial derived from the triangular preconditioning (5.4) is identical to the (2i 1)st GMRES polynomial for the diagonal preconditioning (5.2).

Note that ff fl ! 0 as P e ! 1 so that "stabilising" the standard method is likely to adversely affect the convergence of iterative solvers if the discrete problem is diffusion dominated. 2.2.

Reference-contexts: That is, the iterative solution of `symmetrically indefinite' systems using a method such as MINRES is no better than the much more generally applicable normal equations approach. A more precise statement of this result is given by Freund <ref> [19] </ref>. When proposing the use of preconditioned MINRES for a class of indefinite systems it is therefore important to show that the eigenvalues are not symmetric about the origin.

Reference-contexts: An alternative to adaptive mesh refinement is to "ignore" physical boundary layers, and to stabilise the discrete problem; e.g. using some form of upwinded discretisa tion. In a finite element setting this is conveniently achieved using a Petrov-Galerkin framework <ref> [27, 28] </ref> with a "shifted" (non-conforming) test space, say, a (u h ; v + ffiw rv) = (f h ; v + ffiw rv) 8v 2 X h ;(2.7) 5 where ffi is an appropriately chosen stabilisation/upwinding parameter, see below.

The effectiveness of Krylov subspace methods depends in large part on the existence of a polynomial that takes on the values 1 at the origin and is small on the eigenvalues of Q 1 A = I Q 1 R <ref> [1, 41] </ref>; thus, it is also desirable to make ae (Q 1 R) as small as possible for Krylov sub-space methods. 3.1.

Reference-contexts: The preconditioned system can be solved using any Krylov subspace method. The convergence behavior of such methods depends implicitly on finding a polynomial that is small on the spectrum of the coefficient matrix. (Again see <ref> [42] </ref> or the paper by Van der Vorst in this volume.) The fact that the eigenvalues for the preconditioned system derived from (5.2) lie on both sides of the imaginary axis is a potential disadvantage of this preconditioner. <p> Therefore, this preconditioner is typically more effective for the Oseen problem. Since the eigenvalues for either of these preconditioners are independent of the mesh size, the asymptotic convergence rate of GMRES is also independent h <ref> [42] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Fortunately this does not cause any difficulty in practice, since an over-estimate of the critical parameter is easily computed if the extremal eigenvalues of the Schur complement and the stabilisation matrix are known; specifically, it is shown in <ref> [43] </ref> that fi fl fi 0 if fi fl = 2 =fi 2 with 2 = max p t BA 1 B t p ;(2.37) p6=0 p t Qp A simple estimate of is well known (see [18]): a Cauchy-Schwarz argument yields j (divv; p)j 2 kvk X kpk M kdivvk <p> For such a choice of the preconditioning block M , these constants are tabulated in ([49]) for many different finite elements types * : upper bound on the stabilisation matrix S|an O (1) constant. * fi: positive stabilisation parameter optimally chosen to be just large enough to achieve stability (see <ref> [43] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: This does not affect the stability properties of the time-discretisation, but it does reduce the Crank-Nicolson accuracy to first order as t ! 0 (the first order accuracy of backward Euler is unchanged). To retain second order accuracy in a linear scheme the Simo-Armero scheme <ref> [45] </ref> given by setting u n+ff = u n+ 1 2 with u fl = (3u n u n1 )=2 in Algorithm 1.3 is recommended. Using linearised backward Euler (or the Simo-Armero scheme) a frozen-coefficient Navier-Stokes problem (or Oseen problem) arises at each discrete time step. <p> In contrast to the operator splitting case, the Oseen methodology is primarily of interest when solving steady-state problems|the linearised backward Euler method is uniquely well suited to pseudo-timestepping since it inherits the long term asymptotic dissipative behaviour of (1.1)-(1.2), see <ref> [45] </ref> for details. Alternatively, attacking the steady state version of (1.1)-(1.2) directly introduces a (steady-state) Oseen system at every iterative level. In section 5 we consider techniques for solving such Oseen problems using preconditioned Krylov subspace methods. 2. Spatial discretisation. <p> In practice, for example when solving (1.5), the "wind" is not actually pointwise divergence-free. Our discussion is still relevant in such cases|our starting point is then an equivalent formulation of the momentum conservation equations (1.1), with the convection term expressed in skew-symmetric form, see <ref> [45] </ref> for details. Simple finite difference methods are often appropriate when spatially discretis-ing the model problem (2.1)), especially if the geometry is straightforward and "fast solution" is the goal.

Reference-contexts: Second order accuracy can be achieved by setting u fl = u n+ , but in this case a nonlinear convection-diffusion problem (1.5) must be solved at every time level, in addition to the generalised Stokes problem (1.6). The Peaceman-Rachford splitting method has one drawback (see [5] and <ref> [46] </ref>), namely, that it is not asymptotically stable when applied to the standard model problem with an exponentially decaying solution. Thus we can expect any implementation of Algorithm 1.1 to perform poorly if the time-step is not small enough when the underlying flow exhibits fast transient behaviour. <p> The unconditional stability of the scheme in an incompressible Navier-Stokes setting was established by Kloucek & Rys [31]. In <ref> [46] </ref> a linear -scheme is developed which retains second order accuracy (setting u fl = u n+ in Algorithm 1.2 reduces the accuracy to first order). <p> The key here is to use an appropriate combination of the two convection matrices when freezing the velocity in Algorithm 1.2, viz: u fl = 1 u n+ :(1.10) In this case a linear convection-diffusion problem (1.8) must be solved at each time level. Furthermore, the results in <ref> [46] </ref> show that the accuracy of the resulting method is not compromised. In contrast, making the choice u fl = u n+ badly impinges on accuracy as t ! 0.
