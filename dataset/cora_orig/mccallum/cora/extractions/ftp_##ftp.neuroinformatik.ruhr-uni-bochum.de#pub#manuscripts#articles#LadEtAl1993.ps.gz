Abstract: We present an object recognition system based on the Dynamic Link Architecture, which is an extension to classical Artificial Neural Networks. The Dynamic Link Architecture exploits correlations in the fine-scale temporal structure of cellular signals in order to group neurons dynamically into higher-order entities. These entities represent a very rich structure and can code for high level objects. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the Dynamic Link Architecture we implemented a program that can recognize human faces and other objects from video images. Memorized objects are represented by sparse graphs, whose vertices are labeled by a multi-resolution description in terms of a local power spectrum, and whose edges are labeled by geometrical distance vectors. Object recognition can be formulated as elastic graph matching, which is performed here by stochastic optimization of a matching cost function. Our implementation on a transputer network successfully achieves recognition of human faces and office objects from gray level camera images. The performance of the program is evaluated by a statistical analysis of recognition results from a portrait gallery comprising images of 87 persons.

Reference-contexts: III. The Elastic Graph Matching Algorithm We now come to a concrete implementation, which will specify all detail left open in the abstract description of the previous section. A literal, fully neural realization is not adapted to current computers, and our actual algorithm (see also <ref> [4] </ref>) is designed for efficient use of available arithmetic processors. The success of our system rests to a large extent on the particular way in which we use graphs to represent form. <p> The energy in the resulting components of our image transform should therefore be roughly independent of j ~ kj, an assumption which we have confirmed for our images. This property is important for matching and had been enforced rigidly in earlier versions of our system <ref> [4] </ref>. The ~ k form a family that is self-similar under the application of the group of translations, rotations, and scalings. The family is also known as "Gabor-based wavelets".

Reference-contexts: Binding between neurons is encoded in the form of temporal correlations C I xff;yfi = hoe I yfi i t . These correlations are induced by the excitatory connections within I. The key feature introduced with such correlations is a higher-order neural coding scheme <ref> [5] </ref> as opposed to first-order coding schemes (mean firing rates) used in conventional neural networks.

Reference-contexts: Let us call such self-organized structures "connectivity patterns." Among connectivity patterns there is a number of useful structures. A large network can spontaneously decompose into smaller blocks|segments|, a process that is important for scene segmentation [6]-[9], (see also <ref> [10] </ref>). Another type of network pattern has the form of two-dimensional graphs with short-range connections, just as are needed for the representation of images. Finally, network self-organization can activate as connection patterns those composite graphs that are formed by linking all pairs of corresponding nodes in two identical graphs.

Reference-contexts: C. Object Recognition with Dynamic Links Attributed graph matching has often been discussed and advocated in the context of object recognition. Our pattern recognition system is based on a special form of attributed graph matching which resembles elastic matching <ref> [11] </ref>, [12]: an attributed graph in the model domain, encoding an object, is locally distorted to cope with deformations and changes in perspective. In the mathematical literature, the relation to be established in graph matching is precise isomorphism. This is too restrictive for the purposes of object recognition.

Topology constraints can then be implemented in a soft fashion by connections between those neurons. Simic ([33], [34]) has analytically compared that class of graph matching methods to another one that is called elastic matching and that includes our type of approach.

Reference-contexts: More generally, further invariances like scale or rotational invariance can be implemented (for an algorithmic version see <ref> [18] </ref>) by extending the meaning of "feature correspondence" in the construction of the T IM -connections: if, e.g., scale changes are to be accommodated, feature correspondence has to allow for connections between features encoding the same quality on different scales. <p> This would lead, however, to dense connections between nodes and less specific single connections between features, and elastic graph matching would become difficult or impossible. An alternative, which we are pursuing at present <ref> [18] </ref>, is to introduce global parameters for orientation and size and let these diffuse during the matching, in the same way the grid position is diffusing in the first step of the present matching procedure.

Reference-contexts: The second exponential removes the dc-component of ~ k . Equation (3) does not normalize the energy picked up by a kernel in the convolution. Consequently, this energy will be proportional to j ~ kj 2 . D. Field <ref> [19] </ref> noted that the power spectrum of "natural images" decreases like 1=j ~ kj 2 . The energy in the resulting components of our image transform should therefore be roughly independent of j ~ kj, an assumption which we have confirmed for our images. <p> The Gabor-based wavelets seem to be a good approximation to the sensitivity profiles of neurons found in visual cortex of higher vertebrates (see, e.g., [20]). There is evidence that those cells tend to come in pairs with even and odd symmetry (see [21] and references from <ref> [19] </ref>), similar to the real and imaginary parts of (2). In the choice of the actual values of relative bandwidth oe and the sampling density of ~ k, which are closely related, we diverged, however, somewhat from biological findings in order to achieve better recognition (see Section III-H).

Reference-contexts: The parameter oe determines the ratio of window width to wavelength, i.e., the number of oscillations under the envelope function.

Reference-contexts: Each stage is terminated once a predefined number of trials have failed to improve the cost value. E. Complexity Considerations Many researchers feel that the computational complexity of attributed graph matching is prohibitive. Their argument is mainly based on the NP-completeness of the general subgraph matching problem <ref> [22] </ref>. However, this worst case argument is not applicable (and convincing) for two reasons: i) pattern recognition problems like the one addressed here are solved satisfactorily in almost all situations if good approximations to the best matching solution can be found for the average instance.

Reference-contexts: In particular, we do not require to find the globally optimal solution in the hardest instance which makes the general subgraph matching problem intractable. Neural network systems are especially designed for an efficient search of average case approximations due to their stochastic and analogue nature <ref> [23] </ref>. Furthermore, ii) the combinatorial explosion of possible matching solutions is dramatically reduced by the constraint that nodes are distinguishable by their attributes and that we are mainly dealing with planar or other low-dimensional graphs (see, e.g., [24] for a discussion of efficient algorithms).

The hierarchical representation of our image data suggests that the average running time of our matching algorithm scales linearly with the number of resolution levels which translates into a logarithmical scaling behavior as a function of the image size.

Reference-contexts: However, its design is highly data-parallel, and it is therefore easily implemented on parallel computers. We use a system based on the transputer, a microprocessor with integrated support for a message-passing, distributed memory MIMD architecture <ref> [25] </ref>. Our machine consists of 23 trans-puters, one of which hosts the development system, one is a combined frame grabber/graphics display, and the others are used as a processor farm. We programmed in occam, an implementation of the Communicating Sequential Processes model [26].

It also permits very good exploitation of the concurrency inherent in the hardware (overlap of computation and communication).

For instance, visual segmentation can be achieved with the help of mechanisms that induce temporal signal correlations within segments and anticor-relations between segments [7]-[9], <ref> [35] </ref>, and composite objects and scenes can be represented in a hierarchically structured system where the nodes of graphs are themselves smaller graphs to some depth of recursion.
