Abstract: We show that the result of Barrington, Straubing and Therien [5] provides, as a direct corollary, an exponential lower bound for the size of depth-two MOD 6 circuits computing the AND function. This problem was solved, in a more general way, by Krause and Waack [8]. We point out that all known lower bounds rely on the special form of the MOD 6 gate occurring at the bottom of the circuits, so that in fact, proving a lower bound for "general" MOD 6 circuits of depth two is still an open question. Finding lower bounds for the size of constant depth circuits is a big challenge in complexity theory. The program over monoid model was developed in the hope of obtaining lower bounds using algebraic properties of monoids. The languages recognized by polynomial length programs over monoids were shown to be exactly those in the classes AC 0 , CC 0 , ACC 0 and NC 1 , depending on the algebraic properties of the underlying monoid [2,6]. In fact a super-linear lower bound for the length of such programs can be proved [4], but this does not give a super-linear lower bound for circuit size. However, in their remarkable paper "Non-uniform automata over groups", Barrington, Straubing and Therien obtain some exponential lower bounds for programs over some special kinds of groups. Roughly speaking, these lower bounds can be stated as lower bounds for depth-two circuits with MOD m gates at the inputs and a MOD p k gate at the output, where m is an integer, p is a prime number and k is an integer (Theorem 1 gives the full result).

Reference-contexts: Krause and Waack used communication complexity techniques to solve this problem <ref> [8] </ref>. These techniques apply in particular to depth-two circuits having symmetric gates at the inputs and a MOD m gate at the output. <p> We stress that for general MOD m gates neither this technique nor the technique in <ref> [8] </ref> works. In particular obtaining lower bounds for depth-two MOD f0;1g 6 circuits is still an open question (papers related with similar questions are [7,3,12]).

Reference-contexts: When the output gate is a MOD m gate, for composite m, it seems that finite fields are not powerful enough to represent these circuits, and finding a lower bound for the size of depth-two MOD 6 circuits was stated as an open question <ref> [11] </ref>. Krause and Waack used communication complexity techniques to solve this problem [8]. These techniques apply in particular to depth-two circuits having symmetric gates at the inputs and a MOD m gate at the output. <p> So at least one of the MOD p k h (M 1 ; : : : ; M t (n) ) computes the AND function. A lower bound for such a circuit is therefore obtained from theorem 1. 2 Note that if, as Smolensky <ref> [11] </ref>, we take the MOD m function to be the special case in which S = f0g, it is possible to derive a lower bound for the OR function using a dual argument. We stress that for general MOD m gates neither this technique nor the technique in [8] works.
