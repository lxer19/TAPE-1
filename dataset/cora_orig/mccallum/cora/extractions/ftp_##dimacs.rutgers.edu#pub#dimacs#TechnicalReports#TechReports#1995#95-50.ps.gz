Reference-contexts: Model theoretically we do not get in the limit a first order theory which is stable and generally "low in the stability hierarchy", see Baldwin, Shelah <ref> [BlSh 528] </ref>, for cases with probability ~ n ff . However we get a variant of stability over a predicate: on "small" definable sets the theory is complicated, but for types with no small formulas we are in the stable situation. <p> In fact the model theoretic setting is like [Sh 463] but we shall not pursue this. Note that Baldwin, Shelah <ref> [BlSh 528] </ref> deal with random model with more relations R with probabilities n ff (R) (satisfying the parallel to irrationality of ff). There, the almost sure theory is stable. <p> There, the almost sure theory is stable. In [Sh 550] we define a family of 0-1 contexts where further drawings of relations give us a new context in this family and in all such contexts, elimination of quantifiers to the algebraic closure (as in [ShSp 304], <ref> [BlSh 528] </ref>) holds, but the context is "almost nice" not nice, i.e. every a has a nontrivial closure. Here this is dealt with the general treatment of the elimination, but not used in the main case M 0 n . <p> Then these definitions are reconciled with those in x1, where the closure is choosen as in x1. Two axiomatic frameworks for an abstract elimination of quantifiers argument are presented. (This generalizes <ref> [BlSh 528] </ref>.) These frameworks and further conditions on cl k provide suffiecient conditions for 0 1 laws and convergence laws. Note: in x2 we retain using "relation free amalgamation" (as in [BlSh 528], but in [Sh 550] we will use more general one). <p> Two axiomatic frameworks for an abstract elimination of quantifiers argument are presented. (This generalizes <ref> [BlSh 528] </ref>.) These frameworks and further conditions on cl k provide suffiecient conditions for 0 1 laws and convergence laws. Note: in x2 we retain using "relation free amalgamation" (as in [BlSh 528], but in [Sh 550] we will use more general one). However we waive "random A has no non-trivial closure", hence use "almost nice" rather then nice. In x3 we deal with the case the natural elimination of quantifiers is to monadic logic. <p> The appropriate is defined and thus the interpretations of &lt; fl i and &lt; fl s in the first context (M 0 n ; p i = 1 2 jijj ). Many proofs are analogous to that in [ShSp 304] and <ref> [BlSh 528] </ref>, so we treat them shortly. The new point is the dependence on distance, and hence the equivalence relations . In x6 it is shown that the &lt; fl i and &lt; fl s of x5 agree with the &lt; i and &lt; s of x1. <p> The closure does not need to be in K 1 (though in our application it does). The quantifier elimination result generalizes the result of <ref> [BlSh 528] </ref>. The chief additional ingredient in the proof here is the use of the addition (= Feferman-Vaught) theorem to analyze a pair of models in stable amalgamation; this is necessary as we do not have a priori bound on the size of the closure, whereas there we have. <p> Moreover, - 12 - the argument in <ref> [BlSh 528] </ref> is simpler because &lt; i is defined concretely from a dimension function. Note that the assumption "cl is f.o. definable" (2.2 clause (d)) is not serious: if it fails we have all "y 2 cl k (x)" as atomic formulas in ' . <p> Note that in a family of functions whose ranges intersect in f [A], each is determined by its value on any x 2 B n A. 5:3 The following is central, it does not yet prove almost niceness by here the paralel from [ShSp 304], <ref> [BlSh 528] </ref> were immediate, and here we see the main additional difficulties we have. - 41 - Theorem 5.4 Assume A &lt; fl B (both in K 1 ). <p> Note that (Rang (g j 1 ) n Rang (f )) is disjoint from (Rang (g j 2 ) n Rang (f )) if and only if Rang ( j 1 ) is disjoint from Rang ( j 2 ). Reflecting, this is similar to [ShSp 304], <ref> [BlSh 528] </ref> and is a case of [Sh 550]; informally the transformation of [ShSp 304], [BlSh 528] corresponding to non -equivalent pairs consists of (i) the probability of an edge is 2 [c 1 1 1 (n 1" ) ff ] here for some positive constant c 1 &lt; c 2 <p> Reflecting, this is similar to [ShSp 304], <ref> [BlSh 528] </ref> and is a case of [Sh 550]; informally the transformation of [ShSp 304], [BlSh 528] corresponding to non -equivalent pairs consists of (i) the probability of an edge is 2 [c 1 1 1 (n 1" ) ff ] here for some positive constant c 1 &lt; c 2 (and not as there 1 n ff ), (ii) the number of nodes is now <p> This is a particular case of [Sh 550], but to draw it from <ref> [BlSh 528] </ref>, first draw the unary predicates. <p> bounds to the number of elements in R ` = fx 2 R n or e = fa; b `;j g; j 2 [m ` ] then e 2 edge (B) ) N n j= Q e (x)g Now the rest of the drawing and what we need is like <ref> [BlSh 528] </ref> only having `(fl) sort of elements, which are not exactly of the same size: we can throw some nodes to equalize. 5:9 Now, 5.4, 5.9 are enough for proving &lt; fl i =&lt; i , &lt; fl s =&lt; s , weakly nice and similar things. <p> Remark 5.11 We can get reasonably much better bound (see [ShSp 304], <ref> [BlSh 528] </ref> and [Sh 550]) but this suffices. <p> in x4 and x5, so p i = 1=i ff , for i &gt; 1, p 1 = p 2 (where ff 2 (0; 1) R irrational) and M n = M 0 n (only the graph). (So K 1 = K by 4.4) The argument here parallels that in <ref> [BlSh 528] </ref> which is more hidden in [ShSp 304]. The most delicate step is to establish clauses A (ffi) and (") of Definition 2.11 (almost simply nice).

Reference-contexts: A natural such family of p's is the family of monotonic ones. Can we in this family characterize fp : p monotonic, M 0 n;p satisfies the 0 1 lawg? - 4 - This will be addressed and solved in <ref> [LeSh 581] </ref>. The two cases considered above are protypes of some families with the 0-1 law, but there are some others, for example with the value of the exponent ff "in the neighbourhood" of a rational (and some degenerate ones of course). Let us review the paper.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [Sh 548] </ref> the very weak zero one law was proved for model with a random two place function and for graphs; Spencer has continued this determining the best h for which this holds. Naturally arise the question what occurs if the p i 's are "well behaved".

We can make a case such that both <ref> [ShSp 304] </ref> and [LuSh 435] are particular cases: the probability for fi; jg being an edge of M n for i; j 2 [n] is p n i .

We can make a case such that both <ref> [ShSp 304] </ref> and [LuSh 435] are particular cases: the probability for fi; jg being an edge of M n for i; j 2 [n] is p n i . So in [ShSp 304], p n i = p n and in [LuSh 435], p n i = p i . <p> Its contribution for the valency of a node i is on the average "huge" (still t n). We can think of this as two kinds of edges. The edges of the sort n ff are like in the paper <ref> [ShSp 304] </ref>. The other ones still give large probability for some i to have valency with no a priori bound (though not compared to n, e.g. log n). <p> So with parameters, we can interpret, using a sequence of formulas ' and parameter a, quite long initial segment of the arithmetic (see definition below). This is very unlike <ref> [ShSp 304] </ref> where first order formula '(x) really says little on x: normally that its cl k -closure is x or something on the few elements which are in cl k (x) (so the first order sentences say not little on the model, but inside a model the first order formula <p> There, the almost sure theory is stable.

Of course when is the identity this degenerates to the definition in <ref> [ShSp 304] </ref>. We want to characterize i and s , using w and to prove that they are O.K. (meaning form a nice context). Looking at the expected behaviour, we attempt to give "effective" definition (depending on ff only). <p> Note that in a family of functions whose ranges intersect in f [A], each is determined by its value on any x 2 B n A. 5:3 The following is central, it does not yet prove almost niceness by here the paralel from <ref> [ShSp 304] </ref>, [BlSh 528] were immediate, and here we see the main additional difficulties we have. - 41 - Theorem 5.4 Assume A &lt; fl B (both in K 1 ). <p> So A &lt; fl i B says that there are few such copies of B over any copy of A, i.e. the expected value is &lt; 1.
