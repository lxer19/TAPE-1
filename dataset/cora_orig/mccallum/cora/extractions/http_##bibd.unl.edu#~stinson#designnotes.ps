Reference-contexts: introduction. Two other good introductory textbooks are Combinatorial Designs 3 by Anderson <ref> [1] </ref> and Design Theory by Lindner and Rodger [8]. A more ad-vanced book that contains a great deal of information is also entitled Design Theory, by Beth, Jungnickel and Lenz [2].

The reader can also profitably consult Design Theory by Hughes and Piper [7] and Combinatorics of Experimental Design [13] by Street and Street. Finally, the CRC Handbook of Combinatorial Designs edited by Colbourn and Dinitz [5] is an enormous, encyclopediac reference work that is a valuable resourse for researchers.

The bank employs three senior tellers, but they do not want to trust any individual with the combination. <p> This means that each P K is a parallel class. Further, every pair of shares occurs in a unique block. Therefore, we have a resolvable BIBD with = 1, as required. 7.3 Further Reading For further information about applications of design theory to threshold schemes, see <ref> [5, Chapter V.3] </ref>, [10] and [12]. 78 8 Visual Cryptography Visual cryptography is a visual variant of the idea of threshold schemes, which were discussed in Section 7. Here, the secret is an image made up of black and white pixels. <p> Then m (n 2 n)=(` 2 `), with equality if and only if (X; A) is the dual of an (n; `; 1)-BIBD. 9.3 Further Reading For further information about applications of design theory to group testing, see <ref> [5, Chapter V.6] </ref> and the references there. 94 10 Two-point Sampling 10.1 Monte Carlo Algorithms There are many problems for which no fast deterministic algorithm is known, but which can be solved efficiently using randomized algorithms. <p> For further information, see <ref> [5, Chapter V.4] </ref> and [6]. 100

We will follow the treatment given in Chapter 1 of Design Theory by Lindner and Rodger <ref> [8] </ref>. The constructions will require some results about other types of designs called quasigroups and latin squares, which we study in the next subsection. 4.1 Quasigroups Let X be a finite set, and let ffi be a binary operation defined on X (i.e., ffi : X fiX ! X).
