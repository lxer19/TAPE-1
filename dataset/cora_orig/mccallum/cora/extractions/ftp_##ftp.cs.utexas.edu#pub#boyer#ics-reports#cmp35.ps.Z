Reference-contexts: We make the following claim about our verifier: If a FORTRAN subprogram is accepted and proved by our system and the program can be loaded onto a FORTRAN processor that meets the ANSI specification of FORTRAN <ref> [USAS X3.9-1966 66, Ansi X3.9-1978 78] </ref> and certain parameterized constraints on the accuracy of arithmetic, then any invocation of the program in an environment satisfying the input condition of the program will terminate without run-time errors and will produce an environment satisfying the output condition of the program.
