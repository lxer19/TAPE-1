Title: ON OBSERVING THE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND  
Author: L.A. PAGE 
Address: Princeton, NJ  
Affiliation: Princeton University Dept. of Physics  
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) comprises the oldest photons in the universe and is arguably our most direct cosmological observable. All precise and accurate measurements of its attributes serve to distinguish between cosmological models. Detector technology and observing techniques have advanced to the point where fluctuations in the CMB of order a few microkelvin are measured almost routinely. In these lecture notes, we review recent measurements of both the absolute temperature and the anisotropy of the CMB and discuss the relation between the data and the general theoretical framework. Future directions are indicated and the upcoming satellite experiments are discussed.

Reference-contexts: Over a region of l-space between l = 30 and l = 600, there is overlap between the two probes of the fluctuations: galactic surveys and CMB anisotropy data. There is a nice plot of this in White, Scott, & Silk's review <ref> [3] </ref>. Unfortunately, the data are not sufficiently good, from either probe, to draw firm conclusions. However, early indications are that the simplest models for the formation of structure are incorrect. 5. Anisotropy Measurements: Technologies & Techniques 5.1.

Reference-contexts: This distortion is parameterized by Y ff = (h-=kT ) 2 [T eff (-) T CMB ]=T CMB , with T eff the plasma temperature.

For the beam in Figure 7, the window function is shown in sky . The most frequently used analyses follow Bond's work <ref> [4] </ref>. A complete analysis requires knowledge of the covariance matrix of the data; we call this C D . The full theory-plus-data covariance matrix is given by M = C D + C T .

Reference-contexts: There are two sources not shown on this plot. Near 3000 GHz, thermal emission from the interplanetary dust (Zodiacal light) is roughly ten times smaller than the interstellar dust and its brightness scales with frequency as -4 . Throughout the plotted range, interstellar molecular line emission is also observed <ref> [12] </ref>. In addition to the diffuse foreground, galactic and extragalactic point-like objects such as quasars, blazars, gigahertz-peaked sources, and loud radio sources also emit microwave and far-infrared radiation.

Reference-contexts: Also, we know that many of the extragalactic high-frequency sources are variable. In Figure 1 it is evident that to probe either the spectrum or the anisotropy to a part in 10 3 or 10 5 the foreground emission must be confronted. Before COBE <ref> [13] </ref>, the best full-sky maps were the "Haslam et al." map at 408 MHz [14] and the IRAS dust map, with Zodiacal light subtracted, at 3000 GHz (100 m)[15]. <p> Thus a study of the spectrum is a study of the history of cosmic energetics.

Reference-contexts: In other words, its intensity distribution, to first order, resembles a quadrupole: hot around a circle, cold near the poles. Indeed this quadrupole confounded some of the early measurements of the anisotropy and its removal from the from the COBE/DMR data requires ingenuity <ref> [16] </ref>. The spatial distribution of celestial sources is commonly quantified with the angular spectrum. This formalism is used to describe the anisotropy, 4 radio sources, and the diffuse forground. It allows a direct comparison of the contribution from each. <p> This is the canonically quoted value. However, with a 1=2 ffi resolution map, the rms is closer to 90 K. The final DMR results (the satellite is now turned off) are published in Ap.J Vol 464, 1996 [53], <ref> [16] </ref>, [54], [55], & [56]. The lasting contribution will be the maps of the sky at 30, 53, and 90 GHz. A combination of these maps, optimized to give the anisotropy, has a signal-to-noise of two per 10 ffi fi 10 ffi pixel.

Reference-contexts: A horizontal error bar is often plotted indicating the width of the window function. Any one experiment observes in multiple windows and so the spectrum may be mapped out. One example is given in Figure 9 from the Saskatoon experiment <ref> [17] </ref>. 6. Anisotropy Measurements: The Current Results and Immediate Future The anisotropy of the CMB was first unambiguously measured by the DMR experiment aboard the COBE satellite [52] using 7 ffi resolution full-sky maps at 30, 53, and 90 GHz. <p> The flat dashed line is for a Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum with Q rmsP S = 18 K. Ignore the intrinsic calibration uncertainties and the relative calibra tion uncertainties. Ignore upper limits for l &lt; 500. For some cases, (eg SASK), the data can be combined to give a detection <ref> [17] </ref>. In addition to the Ratra compilation, add the Tegmark results [63], ATCA [70], and the new CAT [48] results. The principle conclusion one should draw from Figure 11 is that there is a general rise in ffiT l as one moves from the COBE scales to smaller angular scales. <p> The measurements have come a long way in the past two years. In three cases multiple experiments have observed the same region of sky and seen the same thing. They are DMR and FIRS [93], DMR and Tenerife [86], and MSAM ([94], [95] & [96]) and SASK <ref> [17] </ref>, [97]. The spectrum of the fluctuations for MSAM and SASK is thermal from 25 to 200 GHz. However, one should still view the data with some caution.

Reference-contexts: The last two maps are found to be good measures of the interstellar dust distribution. Two maps are needed because there may be multiple dust components or, in an explanation that Fixsen <ref> [24] </ref> prefers, the dust temperature may be a function of position. The set of coefficients of the uniform component, ff 0 (-), is then fit to a combination of four frequency distributions.

The most recent published work on parameter estimation for inflation-based models is in <ref> [35] </ref> but one must remember that there are other classes of promising models. At this school, Dick Bond discussed an approach where one works in an eigen-parameter space to circumvent the strong covariance between many of the standard parameters such as B , fl, h, etc.

The principle conclusion one should draw from Figure 11 is that there is a general rise in ffiT l as one moves from the COBE scales to smaller angular scales.

Reference-contexts: The state-of-the-art in absolute measurements, excluding FIRAS, is 1% [29]; the anisotropy has yet to be measured to 15% accuracy. To give a broad and almost un-biased sense of what the anisotropy data are telling us, we take the compilation from Ratra <ref> [92] </ref> (which I believe is the most comprehensive and thoroughly checked compilation to date) and bin the data according to the following: Select logarithmically spaced bins in l with four bins per decade. <p> Ignore the widths of window functions and add data to a bin according to the value of the weighted mean of the window, l e in <ref> [92] </ref>. Many of the data have l=l e &lt; 1=4 so this is not the sin it may at first appear. Compute the weighted mean of the data that fall into each bin and call that the band-power ffiT . <p> Compute the weighted mean of the data that fall into each bin and call that the band-power ffiT . Use the inverse root of the total weight as the error bar. Use all the unique data in <ref> [92] </ref>. Be aware that many of the data points are unconfirmed! Compute the mean value l, of the l e that fall in a given bin. Plot l versus ffiT and connect the ends of the error bars. 21 TABLE 1.

Reference-contexts: The polarization is caused by Thompson scattering. At angular scales of order ten degrees, the polarization may be used to identify any primordial gravity waves (tensor modes) though the signal is expected to be largest at degree scales. Crittenden and Turok <ref> [98] </ref> point out that there is a correlation between the polarization and the anisotropy that is different for the scalar and tensor modes. This correlation should also aid in separating the CMB polarization from polarized foreground emission, about which very little is known. 7.
