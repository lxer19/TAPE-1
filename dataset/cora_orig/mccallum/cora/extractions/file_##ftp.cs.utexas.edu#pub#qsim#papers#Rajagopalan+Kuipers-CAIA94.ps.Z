Abstract: This paper describes an ongoing project to develop a theory of qualitative spatial reasoning which merges a simple, intuitive description of the spatial extent, relative position, and orientation of objects with existing methods for qualitative reasoning about dynamically changing worlds. We are applying our theories within a system for problem solving about the magnetic fields domain. We describe methods for integrating diagram and text input to a problem solver, methods of abstraction for modeling the spatial extents of objects, and a method for modeling spatial relations between objects through inequalities on extremal points which directly allows reasoning about the effects of translational motion.

Reference-contexts: The two abstractions are necessary to guarantee that the actual region of space occupied by an object is contained within the region of space defined by the abstraction used. Abella and Kender <ref> [1] </ref> describe a shape abstraction method based on rectangular bounding boxes that does not provide this guarantee.

Reference-contexts: The issue of integrating text and diagram input has been addressed in other work [15, 18], but the methods assume that the pictures or diagrams are provided in visual form. They address the classic visual scene analysis problem <ref> [2] </ref> of deciding which line segments belong together as parts of the same object, and which are only accidentally intersecting. Domain libraries are used to recognize semantically meaningful collections of objects in the diagram.

Reference-contexts: Our methods are being applied in a problem solver which addresses textbook problems from the magnetic fields domain. The problem solver makes use of the QPC <ref> [3] </ref> and QSIM [11] qualitative reasoning systems and the Algernon [4] knowledge representation system.

We define spatial relations of interest through view descriptions in QPC, and use that system to perform the necessary inequality reasoning to determine the current spatial state of the world and to determine how the spatial state changes over time.

The first step in integrating diagram and text input, after choosing a frame of reference for the diagram, is to associate a common semantics with the objects in the diagram and the text.

Reference-contexts: The work may be roughly divided into two groups: efforts to develop formal, intuitive descriptions independent of any particular device or domain, and efforts to develop methods for modeling and simulating complex mechanisms whose behavior depends on the spatial configuration. Cui, Cohn, and Randell <ref> [5] </ref>, Freksa [7], Galton [8], Mukerjee and Joe [13], Nielsen [14], and Weinberg, Uckun, and Biswas [19], have all been among the contributors of formal, intuitive theories of qualitative spatial reasoning. <p> While these theories have been both simple and elegant, the utility of these approaches for use in larger reasoning systems has yet to be demonstrated. For example, Cui, Cohn, and Randell <ref> [5] </ref> provide an axiomatic description of the relative positions between objects, but cannot reason explicitly about motion.

Reference-contexts: Their theory allows one to determine all possible spatial states that may follow a given state, but does not include a method for using more specific information, such as a motion vector, to narrow the possibilities. Faltings, Forbus, Nielsen, Joskowicz, and Sacks <ref> [6, 9] </ref> address the problem of modeling complex mechanical devices whose behavior depends on the spatial configuration of their mechanically-linked components. Their solutions share the property that a numerically precise description, the configuration space, is computed to provide all possible legal configurations of the components of the device. <p> For the magnetic fields problem solver, we use the extrinsic frame of reference of the rotated diagram. To represent the region of space occupied by an object, we need to model the shape of the object. In some problems, such as determining whether two gears will mesh together <ref> [6] </ref>, exact shapes play a very important role. For other problems, it is more important to reason about the effects of possible changes in spatial state, and the exact shapes of objects are not of great concern.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The goal of qualitative reasoning is to draw useful conclusions from incomplete knowledge, particularly for problems where methods relying on numerically precise inputs may be inapplicable. Textbooks, such as Resnick and Halliday's Physics text <ref> [17] </ref>, are an interesting source of problems as they contain both qualitative and numerically-intensive exercises to test the reader's understanding of concepts. The descriptions of the qualitative exercises, including any accompanying diagrams, generally contain very little numerically precise, problem-specific information and instead seek to cover a large set of scenarios.
