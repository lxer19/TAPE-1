Reference-contexts: The forces acting on the front and rear wheels are F f and F r , respectively. The lateral dynamics equations are obtained by computing the net lateral force and torque acting on the vehicle following Newton-Euler equations <ref> [1] </ref> and choosing _ and v y , as state variables.

Reference-contexts: The gain matrix L can be chosen in a number of ways <ref> [4] </ref>, depending on the assumptions one makes about the availability of noise statistics and the criterion one chooses to optimize. In our case, the gain matrix was chosen to minimize the expected error of our estimate in the steady state using the funtion dlqe available in Matlab.

Reference-contexts: Passenger comfort is another important design criterion and this is typically expressed in terms of jerk, corresponding to the rate of change of acceleration. For a comfortable ride no frequency above 0.1-0.5 Hz should be amplified in the path to lateral acceleration <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Estimates for the remaining state variables, y L , " L , and _ are obtained from our observer and the yaw rate sensor. 6.3 Input-Output Linearization Input-ouput linearization is typically used to linearize nonlinear systems by state feedback as described in <ref> [6] </ref>. The application of this technique to the bicycle model is not, strictly speaking, linearization by state feedback since the bicycle model is already linear. Nonetheless, this technique can be applied to render the model independent of the vehicles longitudinal velocity, v x .

Reference-contexts: The goal of our research efforts in this field has been to understand the fundamental characteristics of this vision based control problem and to use this knowledge to design better control strategies. In <ref> [7] </ref> we presented an analysis of the problem of vision-based lateral control and investigated the effects of changing various important system parameters like the vehicle velocity, the lookahead range of the vision sensor and the processing delay associated with the perception and control system. <p> The transfer function C (s) corresponds to the controller to be designed. A more detailed analysis of how the behavior of this dynamic system changes as a function of important system parameters like, lookahead distance, processing delay and vehicle velocity can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. 4 Vision System The vision-based lane tracking system used in our experiments is an improved version of the one presented in [14]. This system takes its input from a single forward-looking CCD video camera. It extracts potential lane markers from the input using a template-based scheme. <p> Additional performance criteria may be specified in terms of the maximal allowable offset y Lmax as a response to the step change in curvature and in terms of bandwidth requirements on the transfer function F (s) = K L (s) . 6.1 Lead-lag Control Previous analysis <ref> [7] </ref> revealed that at speeds of up to 15 m/s with a lookahead of around 10 meters one can guarantee satisfactory damping of the closed loop poles of V 1 (s) and compensate for the processing delay of the vision sys-tem using simple unity feedback control with proportional gain in the

Reference-contexts: Section 6 contains the conclusions that we have drawn from these experiments. 3 Modeling The dynamics of a passenger vehicle can be described by a detailed 6-DOF nonlinear model <ref> [11] </ref>. Since it is possible to decouple the longitudinal and lateral dynamics, a linearized model of the lateral vehicle dynamics is used for 1 controller design.
