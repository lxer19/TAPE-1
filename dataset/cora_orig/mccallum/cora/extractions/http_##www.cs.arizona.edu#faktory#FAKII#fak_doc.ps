Reference-contexts: The inclusion of fragment assembly constraints in the kernel was motivated by the use of mixed-mode sequencing strategies. Previously we had developed an approach for the layout phase that was suitable for pure shotgun sequencing projects <ref> [Kec91] </ref>. This approach is based on operations research techniques for finding a maximum weight Hamiltonian path through the overlap graph of the first phase. Since that time, it has become clear that large sequencing projects will not and cannot employ a pure shotgun strategy.
