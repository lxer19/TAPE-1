Abstract: We present new finite difference schemes for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The schemes are based on two spatial differencing methods, one is fourth-order accurate and the other is sixth-order accurate. The temporal differencing is based on backward differencing formulas. The schemes use non-staggered grids and satisfy regularity estimates, guaranteeing smoothness of the solutions. The schemes are computationally efficient. Computational results demonstrating the accuracy are presented.

Reference-contexts: Projection methods also have difficulty with higher order accuracy in time, see Shen [16]. This is not so for the methods presented here, where the pressure can be determined to a high order of accuracy. For steady flows the method of Aubert and Deville <ref> [1] </ref> can be applied to yield fourth-order accuracy, at the expense of increasing the number of unknowns and computational complexity of the system. All of these methods use staggered meshes. y This work was supported in part by the U.S.

Reference-contexts: The operator L represents the terms involving spatial derivatives of the velocity. Our approach is motivated by the similarity of the system (7.1) to differential-algebraic systems for ordinary differential 16 equations. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are similar to differential-algebraic systems of index 2, see <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> An adequate theory for the stability of schemes for the Navier-Stokes and Stokes equations has not been developed. Here we rely on the experience and theory of differential-algebraic equations, see <ref> [2] </ref>, to guide our choice. Primarily, we have used schemes based on backward time-differences. These schemes, called backward differencing formula (BDF) schemes, are widely used for solving stiff ordinary differential equations and in differential-algebraic equations, see [2]. <p> Here we rely on the experience and theory of differential-algebraic equations, see <ref> [2] </ref>, to guide our choice.

Reference-contexts: The Regularity of the Schemes. In this section we check the regularity of the schemes. As shown in <ref> [3] </ref> a scheme must be regular in order to insure that the solution be smooth. We consider only the steady equations since the theory has only been developed for the steady state case. The importance of regularity is shown in the examples in section 8.

Reference-contexts: In all these tests with polynomial solutions, the solutions were computed to within machine precision. Similar tests were used to check the temporal differencing. For a test of the method on a less trivial application, we take the solution used by Pearson [12], Chorin <ref> [4] </ref> and others to test their methods.

Reference-contexts: That is, the roots of A (z) = 0 must be inside the unit circle or simple on the unit circle <ref> [5] </ref>, [8]. As the following theorem shows, for the standard multistep methods (7.2) stability also requires that the polynomial B (z) satisfy the root condition. Theorem 7.1.

Reference-contexts: We avoid modifying the Navier-Stokes equations such as is done with the `Poisson pressure equation' method. One difficulty with such methods is the need to decide on additional boundary conditions, especially on the pressure. This is also true for projection methods, see Gresho <ref> [6] </ref>. In our approach the linear systems that must be solved to determine the solution at each time step involve both the momentum and divergence equations. These large systems are solved by preconditioned GMRES methods, [15].

Reference-contexts: These schemes are stable as multistep schemes for ordinary differential equations for K 6; unstable for K = 7 and possibly all larger values of K; see <ref> [7] </ref>. In the numerical tests, the BDF schemes out performed the non-BDF schemes. The backward differencing schemes we have used are: 1. Second-order backward in time (K = 2) ff 0 = 3=2; ff 1 = 2; ff 2 = 1=2; fi 0 = 1 2.

Reference-contexts: The schemes are implicit and appear to be unconditionally stable for the Stokes equations. (A rigorous stability analysis is the subject of further research.)

A disadvantage of these methods is that because they are explicit, there is a severe stability limit on the time step. Moreover, as pointed out by Perot <ref> [11] </ref>, the pressure for fractional-step methods can be no better than first-order accurate in time. Projection methods also have difficulty with higher order accuracy in time, see Shen [16]. This is not so for the methods presented here, where the pressure can be determined to a high order of accuracy. <p> These large systems are solved by preconditioned GMRES methods, [15]. One advantage of our approach is that the pressure can be obtained with the same order of accuracy in space as the velocity, and better than first-order in time which is the limit with fractional-step methods <ref> [11] </ref>. We do not use the finite volume approach, relying on the power of the symbolic difference calculus to obtain high accuracy with compact stencils. Our schemes do not satisfy exact conservation laws for mass or momentum.

Reference-contexts: Notice that the terms on the right-hand side of (3.5) are essentially the standard fourth-order accurate scheme for the Poisson equation derived by Rosser <ref> [14] </ref>. We next consider the approximation of the divergence equation (1.2) or (1.4).

We have used a preconditioned GMRES method <ref> [15] </ref> for the solution of this linear system. The usual method was GMRES (7) with a restart. The preconditioner was an inversion of the operator ff 0 t on the first two equations in the system. Other methods of solving the linear system could also be used.

Reference-contexts: The schemes are for the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, however, the methods for obtaining the equations extend easily to three dimensions and to generalizations of the Navier-Stokes equations. A second-order scheme similar to the ones presented here was presented in <ref> [19] </ref>, although it used a less efficient solution procedure. The methods presented here have been incorporated into a domain decomposition method. The schemes presented here have been tested on sample problems with low Reynolds numbers. <p> Moreover, the existence of the solution is dependent on satisfying the integrability condition. An important issue is the choice of norms to determine convergence of the system (7.4). By requiring only that the quantity ~ r ~u n g n be constant as described in <ref> [19] </ref>, we effectively have a nonsingular system. The average value of ~ r~u n g n over the grid is a measure of the consistency of the data. In all the results shown in section 8 this value is less than the errors themselves by several orders of magnitude. <p> For the runs given in Table 2, the solutions on the initial steps were computed from schemes with fewer time levels. The pressure errors were computed using the `standard deviation' as a norm. That is, the norm is the mean square of the error minus the average error, see <ref> [19] </ref>. There are two principles illustrated by the data in the tables.
