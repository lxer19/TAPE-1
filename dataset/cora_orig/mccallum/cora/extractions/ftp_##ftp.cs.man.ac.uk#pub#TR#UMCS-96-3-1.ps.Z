Reference-contexts: Insofar as it does not, it is because, as yet, internet users are still culturally homogeneous. "More than half of the internet users in the UK are aged between 25 and 44, professional, and 90% are male" <ref> (Arthur 1995) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: talking about a small sub-group of society which shares a sophisticated technology and the assumptions built into that technology. (An early, and impressive, exception to this restriction was the Zapatistas' use of the internet to keep the world informed of the progress, and the dreams, of their insurrection in Mexico <ref> (Berger 1995) </ref>.) We can hope, and indeed predict, that as computer communications technology spreads more widely through the world, and adapts to the new cultures and assumptions it meets, truly global diversity of interpretation will spread with it.

Reference-contexts: Women form a larger, and growing, proportion in the United States <ref> (Miller 1995) </ref>, but on a global perspective, compared to Eco's examples of Calabrian peasants and Third World villagers, we are still talking about a small sub-group of society which shares a sophisticated technology and the assumptions built into that technology.

Reference-contexts: Let me briefly describe one such model and the lessons it offers about the nature of language. GALEN <ref> (Rector et al 1993, 1995) </ref> is a European Community funded research project building an advanced medical information system, based on a central concept model of medical knowledge which can support a range of clinical applications (diagnostic decision support, epidemiological surveys, and automatic generation of patient history summaries, for example), in a <p> The assumption underlying the increasing internationalization of medicine is that there is a shared model of medical science and medical care which transcends local idiosyncracies of language and usage. It remains a matter of controversy as to how far such a language independent model of medical concepts is possible. <ref> (Rector et al 1993) </ref>.
