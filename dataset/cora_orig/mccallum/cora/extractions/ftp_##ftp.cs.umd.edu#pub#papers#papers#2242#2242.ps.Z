Abstract: In this paper we propose the use of fractals and especially the Hilbert curve, in order to design good distance-preserving mappings. Such mappings improve the performance of secondary-key- and spatial- access methods, where multidimensional points have to be stored on an 1-dimensional medium (e.g., disk). Good clustering reduces the number of disk accesses on retrieval, improving the response time. Our experiments on range queries and nearest neighbor queries showed that the proposed Hilbert curve achieves better clustering than older methods ("bit-shuffling", or Peano curve), for every situation we tried.

The three space-filling curves we compare are the Peano curve, the reflected binary gray-code (RBG) curve [7] and the Hilbert curve. The first two have been used before as distance preserving mappings for partial match retrieval.

Reference-contexts: The curve can keep growing recursively by following the same rotation and reflection pattern at each vertex of the basic curve.

Reference-contexts: The goal is to preserve the distance, that is, points which are close in space and represent similar data should be stored close together in the linear order. The space-filling curves are a special case of fractals <ref> [10] </ref>. Distance preserving mappings are useful in two general situations: a) when we have to manage multidimensional points (geometric data) and b) when we have to store a k-dimensional array on the disk. Multidimensional data appear in many applications.

Reference-contexts: The main motivation for this work is efficient secondary key retrieval. A record with k attributes corresponds to a point in a k-d space (see Figure 1.1). A class of secondary key methods is based on the idea of distance preserving mappings, using "bit-shuffling" or "z-ordering" <ref> [14] </ref>, which is essentially the Peano curve. The binary representations of the attribute values are combined ("shuffled") to create a single value, the "z-value", which can be used as the primary key in conjunction with any primary-key access method. <p> Orenstein <ref> [14] </ref> used the - 4 - term z-ordering to refer to the ordering of the Peano curve. He also used the term z-value to refer to the order of the point in the z-ordering. <p> See Fig. A.1 for an example. x = 0 0 0 1 y = 0 1 1 0 point ( 1 , 6 ) 1000 0 1 1 0 ) 2 = ( 22 ) 10 string = ( Fig. A.1 Bit interleaving (Orenstein and Merrett) <ref> [14] </ref> 3. Calculate the decimal value of the resulting binary string. (Note: The the z-value of the point (1,6) in Fig. 4 is 22) Higher dimensions of the Peano curve are calculated the same way. For k dimensional curves, read and interleave k numbers instead of two numbers.
