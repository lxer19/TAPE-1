Title: Nonparametric Bayes methods using predictive updating  
Author: Michael A. Newton Fernando A. Quintana Yunlei Zhang 
Note: This is page 1 Printer: Opaque this  
Abstract: Approximate nonparametric Bayes estimates calculated under a Dirichlet process prior are readily obtained in a wide range of models using a simple recursive algorithm. This chapter develops the recursion using elementary facts about nonparametric predictive distributions, and applies it to an interval censoring problem and to a Markov chain mixture model. S-Plus code is provided.

Reference-contexts: The reader may be surprised that so many samples are required for G n to approach G, but remember that there is extreme information loss in this example. Also, cube-root rather than square-root asymptotics govern standard estimators with such information loss <ref> (Groeneboom and Wellner, 1992) </ref>. For the calculations reported in Figure 1 we did not use nominal weights w i = 1=(i + ff) suggested by (1.1). Inspection shows that these give relatively high weight to the first observations and quite low weight to later observations.

Reference-contexts: In Section 7, we dissect a particular example with n = 2 to study this phenomenon. 4 Michael A. Newton, Fernando A. Quintana , Yunlei Zhang The proposed recursion has the form of a stochastic approximation algorithm <ref> (Kushner and Yin, 1997) </ref>, one motivated by Dirichlet-process based learning and one formally residing in a function space. An important special case of the proposed recursion is the quasi-Bayes sequential procedure discussed by Smith and Makov (1978) and elsewhere. The canonical quasi-Bayes problem concerns finite mixture models.

Reference-contexts: that the Dirichlet-process distributed G may be expressed G (B) = P k w k 1 B (v k ) where v 1 ; v 2 ; : : : are independent and identically distributed from G 0 and where the w k 's arise from a simple stick-breaking exercise <ref> (Sethuraman, 1994) </ref>. Specifically, w 1 = b 1 , and for any k 2, w k = b k j=1 (1 b j ) where b 1 ; b 2 ; : : : are independent and identically distributed Beta (1; ff) random variates.
