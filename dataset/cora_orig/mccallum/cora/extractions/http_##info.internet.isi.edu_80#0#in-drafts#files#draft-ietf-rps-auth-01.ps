Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress." Abstract The RIPE database specifications [2] and RPSL language [1] define languages used as the basis for representing information in a routing policy system. A repository for routing policy system information is known as a routing registry. A routing registry provides a means of exchanging information needed to address many issues on importance to the operation of the Internet. The implementation and deployment of a routing policy system must maintain some degree of integrity to be of any operational use. This document addresses the need to assure integrity of the data by providing an authentication and authorization model.

Reference-contexts: Renumbering is viewed as a practical means to maintain a strict numeric hierarchy [20]. It is also acknowledged that renumbering IPv4 networks can be difficult <ref> [20, 3, 21] </ref>. We examine first the simple case where hierarchy still exists. We then examine the operational cases where either initial topology is not tree structured or cases where topology changes. B.1 simple hierarchical address allocation and route allocation This is the simplest case.

Reference-contexts: The RIPE database formats as described in [2] are the basis of current IRR. Routing protocols themselves provide no assurance that the origination of a route is legitimate and can actually reach the stated destination. The nature of CIDR allows more specific prefixes to override less specific prefixes <ref> [9, 19, 8] </ref>. Even with signed route origination, there is no way to determine if a more specific prefix is legitimate and should override a less specific route announcement without a means of determining who is authorized to announce specific prefixes. <p> The dial account need not be with the same provider used by the major institution. The potential for error is increased by the CIDR preference for more specific routes <ref> [8] </ref>. If an institution advertises a single route of a given length and a distant router advertises a more specific router covering critical hosts, the more specific route, if accepted at all, is preferred regardless of administrative weighting or any routing protocol attributes.

Reference-contexts: These registries in turn assign smaller ranges for direct use or to topologically large entities where allocations according to topology can reduce the amount of routing information needed (promote better route aggregation). AS objects are allocated as topology dictates the need for additional AS <ref> [10] </ref>. Route objects can be registered by those with authorization given by the AS and by the address owner.

Reference-contexts: Villamizar, et. al. Expires November 15, 1998 [Page 5] INTERNET-DRAFT Routing Policy System Security May 15, 1998 Address allocation and name allocation is already delegated. Since delegation can be to outside registries it is at least somewhat distributed <ref> [11] </ref>. Autonomous System (AS) numbers are allocated by the same authorities. It makes sense to delegate the routing number space in a manner similar to the address allocation and AS number allocation. <p> There is no standardization of address allocation policies though guidelines do exist <ref> [11, 20] </ref>. Whether authorization allows the recovery of address space must be selectable on a per object basis and may differ in parts of the database.

Reference-contexts: The PRDB accommodated CIDR in 1993 [13] and the RIPE database accommodated the entry of CIDR prefixes from inception, but RPSL provides many needed improvements including explicit support for aggregation.
