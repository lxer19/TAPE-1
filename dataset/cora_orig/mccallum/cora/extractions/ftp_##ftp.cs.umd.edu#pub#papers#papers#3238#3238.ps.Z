Abstract: The updating and downdating of QR decompositions has important applications in a number of areas. There is essentially one standard updating algorithm, based on plane rotations, which is backwards stable. Three downdating algorithms have been treated in the literature: the LINPACK algorithm, the method of hyperbolic transformations, and Chambers' algorithm. Although none of these algorithms is backwards stable, the first and third satisfy a relational stability condition. In this paper, it is shown that relational stability extends to a sequence of updates and downdates. In consequence, other things being equal, if the final decomposition in the sequence is well conditioned, it will be accurately computed, even though intermediate decompositions may be almost completely inaccurate. These results are also applied to the two-sided orthogonal decompositions, such as the URV decomposition. fl This report is available by anonymous ftp from thales.cs.umd.edu in the directory pub/reports. y Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742.

A Numerical Example To illustrate the the above results we will give a numerical example in which a downdate from a well-conditioned matrix R 0 to an ill-conditioned matrix R 1 is followed by an update to a well conditioned matrix R 2 .

Reference-contexts: Specifically, the mathematical relations that hold between the true quantities, continue to hold for the computed quantities provided they are perturbed slightly. We will show that relational stability is preserved in a sequence of updates and downdates. This, combined with the block perturbation theory of Elden and Park <ref> [6] </ref>, implies that if the final result of sequence of updates and downdates is well conditioned then it will be computed accurately. The method of plane hyperbolic transformations is not relationally stable. <p> It follows that the error in (4.1) is bounded by kEk nK* M : (4.2) To assess the accuracy of R n , we do a block perturbation analysis in the spirit of Elden and Park <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> An important contribution of this paper, then, is to show when numerical considerations need not enter into this decision. Acknowledgements Parts of this paper were inspired by the block perturbation analysis of Park and Elden <ref> [6] </ref>, which showed how to avoid intermediate quantities in assessing the accuracy of the final result.
