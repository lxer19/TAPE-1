Reference-contexts: The use of constraints in place of stiff springs trades the problem of numerical stability for the seemingly harder problem of efficient constraint handling. The conventional Lagrange-multiplier constraint solution algorithm is O (n 3 ) with respect to the number of constraints <ref> [2] </ref>, requiring the solution of a linear system in the form of M x = b; (2.5) where M is a square matrix which may not be sparse or invertible 3 . <p> 4.1.1 Reduced Coordinate Formulations In reduced coordinate formulations, an unconstrained system with m degrees of freedom (DOFs) is subject to a set of constraints which remove c of those DOFs, and parameterizes the remaining n = m c using a reduced set of n coordinates, which are called generalized coordinates <ref> [2] </ref>. For example, an articulated figure composed of blocks, each with six DOFs, may be described in terms of joint linkages, each with one, two, or three DOFs and a set of joint angles. <p> Introducing loops or cycles breaks the hierarchy, making 22 If a reduced-coordinate formulation can be found, it is possible to solve for the accelerations of the n generalized coordinates in O (n) time <ref> [2] </ref>. 4.1.2 Lagrange Multiplier Formulations Lagrange multiplier formulations maintain a set of constraints by introducing constraint forces into the original m DOF system. Lagrange multiplier formulations have a number of advantages, most notably the ability to easily describe complex, arbitrary constraint systems with any number of loops. <p> Lagrange multiplier formulations have a number of advantages, most notably the ability to easily describe complex, arbitrary constraint systems with any number of loops.

Reference-contexts: These reasons alone make cloth worth studying, but few people outside the narrow fields of textile engineering and fabric science have scientifically investigated its properties, and most of this work has been done only in the last sixty years <ref> [4] </ref>. More recently, cloth has come to the attention of computer graphics researchers who are interested in simulating its look and behavior for computer animation applications. <p> Textile engineers are concerned with cloth primarily as an engineering material, whereas computer graphics researchers are concerned primarily with aesthetics. The first group tends to view cloth at the micro-mechanical level, whereas the second is more concerned with the material's macro-scale behavior and overall "look" <ref> [4] </ref>. The focus of research in this thesis is the modeling of cloth for computer graphics applications, although in principle these results could also be used in engineering applications.
