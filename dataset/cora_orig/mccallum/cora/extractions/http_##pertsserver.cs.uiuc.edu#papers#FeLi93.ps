Abstract: We describe a real-time speech application which simulates the human production of natural-language utterances in a two-person conversation. Since generating such utterances is a complex and often time-consuming task, we examine the timing constraints and result-quality requirements of this application, as well as the dependencies between the timing constraints and result qualities of the tasks that generate utterances. We then extend the imprecise computation model to capture these dependencies and discuss the general applicability of the extended model.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The imprecise computation technique <ref> [3] </ref> is a way to improve the scheduling feasibility of applications where results of poorer quality are better than late results. <p> This work addresses many of the issues raised in [1]. While the emphasis of [1] is on the use of the anytime approach for time-dependent planning [2], we focus on extending the imprecise computation technique, developed in <ref> [3] </ref>, in order to model the tasks in a real-time speech application. 2 A Real-Time Speech Application We refer to the two persons in the conversation and the tasks that emulate them as Alice and Bob.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, Figure 2 shows that the relative deadline of Alice's talking task is given by the execution times of Bob's listening and pre-planning tasks. Moreover, this relative deadline is a random variable characterized by a probability distribution <ref> [4] </ref>. We formally describe Bob's thought process by the state diagram in Figure 3. <p> In particular, Figure 4 shows that this relative deadline of Bob's planning task is given by the execution times of Alice's waiting and pre-planning tasks. This relative deadline is a random variable that is characterized probabilistically <ref> [4] </ref>.
