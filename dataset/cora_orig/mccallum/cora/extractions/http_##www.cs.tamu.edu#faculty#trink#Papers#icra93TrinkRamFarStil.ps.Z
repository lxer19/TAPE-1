Abstract: Robotic hands or arms that are capable of enveloping the workpieces that they manipulate hold several advantages over mechanism that cannot. One important advantage is that envelopment of the workpiece ensures grasp maintenance even if the object experiences significant external forces in directions unknown prior to grasp synthesis. This makes enveloping mechanism useful in low-friction and microgravity environments. In this paper we define first-order stability cells which were used to plan a planar, "whole-arm," manipulation task of a slippery workpiece. For most, but not all, of the plan, the workpiece was enveloped. Experimental results are presented.

While contacts were restricted to the finger tips, they used the Salisbury Hand to perform manipulation tasks with sliding.

Reference-contexts: Stability cells are particularly useful in the frictionless case, because all paths within them correspond to reversible quasistatic motions [13]. 3.1.1 Contact Formation Cells A contact formation, or CF, <ref> [2] </ref> is a qualitative representation of the state of contact among all the bodies in the system. A CF is conveniently viewed as a list of elemental contacts (vertex-face and edge-edge con-tacts), that corresponds to a surface patch of a configuration obstacle, or C-obstacle (for examples of CF's see [2] and <p> CF, <ref> [2] </ref> is a qualitative representation of the state of contact among all the bodies in the system.

Reference-contexts: The elements of the vector functions f geo and h geo are C-functions defined in <ref> [4] </ref>. Since the elements of f geo represent geometric constraints, they will be referred to as geometric C-functions. <p> However, they do not prevent the overlapping of feature pairs other than those in the current set of elemental contacts. Therefore, E C must be intersected with C valid , defined by Latombe to be the union of free space and contact space <ref> [4] </ref>. The set CF contains all system configurations which are geometrically feasible for a given set of elemental contacts. The vector function f geo has one element for every elemental contact.

Reference-contexts: Since FS-cells are not convex sets, geodesic segments connecting entry and exit points in the FS-cells are not guaranteed to yield feasible plans. However this can be overcome by employing slightly modified versions of Lumelsky's "Bug" algorithms <ref> [5] </ref>. 3.2 Planning: Phase 2 Manipulation plans determined in Phase 1 assume that all contacts slide and by construction satisfy the applicable kinematic constraints, (1) and (2), at every point along the joint space path.

The scalar is the nullity of W n and can be viewed as the number of "extra" contacts which must be maintained by compliant control. In the frictionless case, the Coulomb friction model does not apply.

Reference-contexts: Thus envelopment using only finger tips is impractical. Instead, all surfaces of all of the links of the manipulator system should be used [10]. This concept is referred to as "whole-arm" manipulation <ref> [9] </ref>. When not restricting contacts to be on the finger tips, manipulation of an enveloped workpiece can be achieved by systems with small numbers of links and actuators, thereby reducing the mass and complexity of the mechanism.

A contact formation cell, or CF-cell, is the set of points, (q ; ), in C-space for which a particular set of elemental contacts is achieved and no bodies interpenetrate. <p> In general jamming is important. However, in the specific application discussed below, the coefficient of friction was small enough so that jamming never occurred. Therefore, we will not discuss it further here. 3 This is the same path that was discussed in <ref> [11] </ref> before formalizing the concept of FS-cells and one on the right finger. At 520, a new contact occurs on the palm. The object then translates to the left, breaking the distal contact on the left finger.

Reference-contexts: First-order stability requires that the wrench ma trix, W n , have full row rank and that there exist at least n q strictly positive elements of the wrench inten sity vector, c n , an n c -vector <ref> [12] </ref>. Under these restrictions, W n can always be written as [W nI j W nII ] such that W nI 1 exists. <p> The necessary and sufficient conditions for form closure are that the rank of W n be n q and that the positive vector k exist such that the product W nI 1 W nII k has strictly negative elements <ref> [12] </ref>. From these conditions, one can infer that n c must be greater than n q . Therefore, form closure can only exist in regions of compliant FS-cells.

Reference-contexts: Henceforth, the motion associated with each set will be referred to as a mode of motion. 3 Planning and Execution Our approach to planning dexterous manipulation tasks involving slippery workpieces is broken into two phases. In Phase 1, frictionless planning proceeds via a CF-cell <ref> [13] </ref> decomposition of C-space. The CF-cells are modified to create FS-cells whose connectivity is represented in a graph. A path through the graph connecting the nodes corresponding to the initial and goal configurations defines a family of usable joint trajectories. <p> Stability cells are particularly useful in the frictionless case, because all paths within them correspond to reversible quasistatic motions <ref> [13] </ref>. 3.1.1 Contact Formation Cells A contact formation, or CF, [2] is a qualitative representation of the state of contact among all the bodies in the system. <p> The satisfaction of more than n q +n geometric C-functions would require special part geometries. 3.1.2 First-Order Stability Cells In this section, the stability constraints, or physical C-functions, are derived as functions of q, , and the joint effort vector, t . We make use of the following relationships <ref> [13] </ref>: W T @f geo J n = @ where J n and W T n are the Jacobian and transposed wrench matrices corresponding to the normal components of the relative velocities at all contact points. <p> f phy which is defined as follows: f phy (q ; ; t ) = A III k + (G III t III )d n s ) III ; d 6= 0 (15) 1 The case for which A does not have full column rank can be handled similarly (see <ref> [13] </ref> for details). where t III , G III , and (J T n s ) III are the partitions of t , G , and (J T n s ) corresponding to the partition A III .

Reference-contexts: Let _q and _ be the generalized velocity vectors of the workpiece and the manipulator system, respectively, with lengths n q and n . Then the applicable kinematic constraints can be written as follows <ref> [14] </ref>: W T where each row of the transposed applicable wrench matrix W T A and the applicable Jacobian matrix J A correspond to one applicable kinematic constraint on the system. For each sliding contact, equation (1) ensures that the normal relative velocity at the contact is zero. <p> Inequality (5) ensures that the contact forces at rolling contacts lie within their Coulomb friction cones and all contact forces are compressive. The matrix B A becomes the identity matrix if all contacts are sliding or if the object is frictionless (see <ref> [14] </ref> for more details). Accurate motion prediction is only possible if the set of applicable kinematic constraints can be identified at every instant. Unfortunately there may be more that one feasible set for a given configuration [14]. <p> identity matrix if all contacts are sliding or if the object is frictionless (see <ref> [14] </ref> for more details). Accurate motion prediction is only possible if the set of applicable kinematic constraints can be identified at every instant. Unfortunately there may be more that one feasible set for a given configuration [14]. Therefore, in planning quasistatic manipulation tasks, we are forced to consider 3 n c sets of applicable kinematic constraints, where n c is the number of con tacts. <p> Therefore, we must determine conditions under which the answer is "No" by checking the qua sistatic feasibility of all 3 n c possible modes of motion <ref> [14] </ref>. Our motion model is quasistatic, but, unfortunately, mode-of-motion switching is an inherently dynamic event. Joint and object velocities and wrench intensities undergo discontinuous changes. Thus one would be tempted to include dynamic and impact effects.
