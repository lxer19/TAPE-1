Title: System Administration: Monitoring, Diagnosing, and Repairing  
Author: Eric Anderson 
Abstract: We first describe the general goals of system administration explaining the relationship to monitoring, diagnosing, and repairing (MDR). Then, we describe the functional and environmental concerns for a MDR system, and use these concerns to explain how previous approaches have failed to fully address the problem. Next, we describe the major pieces of our approach, and identify the research questions associated with each piece. Finally we present a method for testing the system when it is created.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that Boolean disjunctions are still learnable with random errors [Sloa89], and some work has been done to show that they are learnable with a malicious adversary misclassifying examples <ref> [Ande94] </ref>. It is our hope that the examples presented to the system will be sufficient for the system to learn in a small number of examples.

Reference-contexts: A number of other systems <ref> [Simo91, Ship91, Hans93, Scha93, Seda95,Walt95, Apis96] </ref> show variants on the systems described above. Some of them have very complicated subsystems for statistics gathering, and they vary on whether the gathering happens from a single node, or happens on remote nodes and is sent to a single node.

Reference-contexts: This means that there will be bursts at all timescales, and that the load will fluctuate greatly over many timescales. However, given that previous SA systems have just used hard coded constants, and that other non-SA systems have successfully used adaptation <ref> [Jaco88,Karn91, Brak95] </ref>, we believe that it should be possible to have our system automatically adapt. The second part is more complicated. We wish to have the MDR system identify which of the variables are most relevant to showing that the system will not be functioning.

Reference-contexts: It uses a rule based system to show dependencies in services. For example, to be able to print, a user needs a default printer, appropriate print daemons, and the printer needs to be working. Dolphin will gather information via SNMP <ref> [Case90] </ref> or RPC [Sun86]. The information is stored in a proprietary internal format, which can be accessed through the user interface provided. Dolphin uses a hierarchical, objectoriented structure for its internal data.

Reference-contexts: It provides some support for extensibility allowing other companies to write complete drop in modules. It only supports data gathering through SNMP, but does a good job of letting administrators navigate through the information available in that way. As of SNMP version 2 <ref> [Case96] </ref>, there is some support for multiple monitoring stations to communicate with each other. As with most of these systems, it has poor fault-tolerance and scalability properties. Furthermore its architecture is not easily extensible.

Reference-contexts: Traditional system have tied this piece into one of the other modules that we have described, dramatically reducing their extensibility. Our decision to separate out the data storage, and to use an SQL <ref> [Cham76] </ref> database, starts to make our system easier to extend (key piece 2) However, in order to achieve key piece 1, which is to have a fault-tolerant, scalable system, we can not simply run a single central database.

Reference-contexts: We will use this in combination with a runtime extensible language such as Java [Gosl95], Perl [Wall96], Tcl [Oust90], or Scheme <ref> [Clin91] </ref> to support secure remote execute of fine-grain actions. In order to support delegation of rights, so that the administrator does not have to be involved in all repairs, we plan on creating network transferable capabilities using public key cryptography [Schn96].

Reference-contexts: Pulsar has most of the disadvantages that weakened the TkIned program. It also has the disadvantage that all of the constants in the pulse monitors needs to be configured by the administrator. The HP Dolphin research project <ref> [Dolphin96] </ref>, which has been partially turned into the HP AdminCenter product attempts to handle the problem of explaining the cause of various failures in systems. It uses a rule based system to show dependencies in services.

Reference-contexts: It has no support for automatic repairs. Because of the monolithic structure, it may not perform well under adverse conditions, and it has no support for post-mortum analysis. Finally, the centralized structure limits its scalability. Another approach to system monitoring is the pulsar system <ref> [Fink97] </ref>. Pulsar uses distributed programs (pulse monitors) which measure a statistic and determine whether it is within some particular set of hardcoded bounds. The distributed programs then contact a central display server and report the information to the display server. Pulse monitors are expected to run infrequently.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we are implementing a library that provides abstractions to the user of principals (hosts, users), and properties (signed, sealed, verifiable) and abstracts away many of the details of key management, and algorithmic concerns. We will use this in combination with a runtime extensible language such as Java <ref> [Gosl95] </ref>, Perl [Wall96], Tcl [Oust90], or Scheme [Clin91] to support secure remote execute of fine-grain actions. In order to support delegation of rights, so that the administrator does not have to be involved in all repairs, we plan on creating network transferable capabilities using public key cryptography [Schn96].

Reference-contexts: This single metric would display a more general view of the system, and would hence provide an overview which could then be more deeply examined. It is likely that we will draw on some of the ideas from databases <ref> [Gray95] </ref>, and scientific visualization. For example, a recent visualization of the Myrinet computer network in the Berkeley NOW helped identify that the network was not constructed the way that had been intended.

(Dont expect to answer this) Can the gathering and caching protocols adapt based on the queries which are currently being asked of the system? (Dont expect to answer this) We have already begun addressing the first question in our MDR prototype.

They also provided support for users to place pages into the system. The Priv <ref> [Hill96] </ref>, and Sudo [Mill97] systems provide various forms of support for control over the programs that various users can execute. They support different types of configurations. Priv has a complex format for specifying valid arguments. Sudo has a simple configuration file that supports control over commands that can be executed.

Reference-contexts: Second, we want the system to identify which of the various statistics (when out of bounds) indicates a problem. Handling the first part is simple, as the statistics are gathered, we calculate averages, standard deviations, and burst sizes, and other statistical measures <ref> [Jain91] </ref>. One complication that is likely to arise is that many of the measurements will probably be self-similar [Lela94]. This means that there will be bursts at all timescales, and that the load will fluctuate greatly over many timescales.

Reference-contexts: Hue (color) does not as naturally correspond to a linear scale, but can be used to identify important items on the screen. Since we know that the human eye can distinguish about 380,000 colors [SigGraphHSV], we have a lot of flexibility for displaying information using colors. However, <ref> [Murc84] </ref> cautions against using too many different colors because that can tire out the eye. We therefore have to balance these two opposing concerns. Tuftes books on displaying quantitative information [Tuft83, Tuft90, Tuft97] provide guidance for maximizing the amount of information displayed per printed glyph.

Reference-contexts: All of the nodes are aggregates of ten of the nodes in the NOW system. Note it may be hard to see some of variations given the noncolor nature of the printout. 9 A theoretical model for this was proposed in [Vali84], and specific cases <ref> [Litt89] </ref> have been shown to be learnable in polynomial time. In particular, Boolean disjunctions are learnable. Given a series of examples, the computer can learn that the function will be true if some of the various variables are true.
