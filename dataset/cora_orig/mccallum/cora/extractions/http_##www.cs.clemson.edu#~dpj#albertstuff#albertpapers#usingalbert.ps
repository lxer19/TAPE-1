Abstract: Albert is an interactive computer system for building nonassociative algebras [2]. In this paper, we suggest certain techniques for using Albert that allow one to posit and test hypotheses effectively. This process provides a fast way to achieve new results, and interacts nicely with traditional methods. We demonstrate the methodology by proving that any semiprime ring, having characteristic 6= 2; 3, and satisfying the identities (a; b; c) (a; c; b) = (a; [b; c]; d) = 0, is associative. This generalizes a recent result by Y. Paul [7].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently, an interactive computer program known as Albert, for building nonassociative algebras was developed <ref> [2] </ref>. With this system, the user specifies the generators and the identities that the algebra is to satisfy, as well as the underlying field of scalars. Albert constructs the free nonassociative algebra satisfying these identities.

Reference-contexts: As observed in [4], identity 2 0 , a ring which satisfies (1) and (7) must satisfy (x; y; z) + (y; z; x) + (z; x; y) = 0; (27) and so is of type (1; 1). From identity (8) of <ref> [3] </ref> such rings satisfy [(w; y; z); x] = [(x; y; z); w]: (28) From f (x; y; z; y) = 0, it follows using (1) and (2) that (xy; z; y) = x (y; z; y) + (x; y; z)y: (29) However (xy; z; y) = (xy; y; z) using

Reference-contexts: This completes the proof. 2. Proof of Lemma 5: We assume R satisfies (1), (2), and (7). As observed in <ref> [4] </ref>, identity 2 0 , a ring which satisfies (1) and (7) must satisfy (x; y; z) + (y; z; x) + (z; x; y) = 0; (27) and so is of type (1; 1).

Reference-contexts: If one omits (1) then there exist finite division rings which are commutative but not associative. If one omits (2) then there exist simple rings and also rings without proper divisors of zero which do not even satisfy (x; x; x) = 0, <ref> [6] </ref>. 5 3 Proof of Theorem We now abandon the computer, and prove the conjecture. Lemma 1 is easy to show, and so it suffices to establish Lemmas 2,4,5. So throughout this section, let R be a ring of characteristic 6= 2; 3.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we let B denote P (R; R; R), the linear span of all associators. The identities we wish to study are (a; b; c) (a; c; b) = 0 (1) Rings satisfying identities (1) and (2) were studied by Y. Paul in <ref> [7] </ref>. There he showed that a prime ring satisfying these identities is either associative or its nucleus and center coincide. We will extend his work. <p> We will extend his work. In particular, we will show that any semiprime ring having characteristic 6= 2; 3 and satisfying (1) and (2) must be associative. 2 Formulating the Conjecture Assume that R is a semiprime ring satisfying identities (1) and (2). Paul's insight ( <ref> [7] </ref>, p. 93, eq. 3) was to prove that in such rings (a; b; c) [[d; e]; f ] = 0: (3) Let A be the ideal generated by B = (R; R; R), and let C be the ideal generated by [[R; R]; R].
