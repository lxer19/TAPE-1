Proposition 1.3 (Large Deviation Limit) The first part of the following is due to Varadhan and the second part is due to Bryc. 1. <p> One can hope, via an exploration of the dual representation in the stochastic case and a suitably scaled convergence argument, to conclude a deterministic dual as in 6 Proposition 1.3 and hence the Large Deviation Principle. This is essentially the program used in Dupuis and Ellis <ref> [7] </ref>. However, unless the processes are defined in discrete time (as demonstrated in Dupuis and Ellis [7]), to give a general stochastic dual representation as in Proposition 1.2 seems difficult: the function f 2 C (D E [0; 1)) is a function on the space of trajectories. <p> This is essentially the program used in Dupuis and Ellis <ref> [7] </ref>. However, unless the processes are defined in discrete time (as demonstrated in Dupuis and Ellis [7]), to give a general stochastic dual representation as in Proposition 1.2 seems difficult: the function f 2 C (D E [0; 1)) is a function on the space of trajectories.

The approach employed in Dupuis and Ellis [7] to tackle this dilemma, when dealing with a continuous time processes example, is to first discretize the continuous processes; consider the past trajectory as an artificial state, create a two state Markov process where a functional of the trajectory is also the functional of the state for the new two <p> closer look at the second step actually reveals that the quantity that gives the rate function in the limit ("running cost", see next section) does not change its form whether or not the artificial state is created ( an intuitive explanation is given on page 29 of Dupuis and Ellis <ref> [7] </ref>). This makes us conjecture that due to the special structure of Markov processes, consider functionals of the following form might just be enough: log E [expff (X n (t))gjX (0) = x] for any t and f 2 C (E). <p> Proof: The proof is basically given by Theorem 1.3 in Kurtz [13]. Under the assumption 2.20, Lemma 7.4 in Dupuis and Ellis <ref> [7] </ref> should be used to replace the estimate (1.13) in Kurtz [13], which gives the relative compactness of the M-marginal distributions.

The rest of the proof is the same. Proof Complete. It should be point out that the definition of tightness function and Lemma 7.4 in Dupuis and Ellis [7] also require the metric space to be complete in addition to separable. <p> Ideas and techniques along this line are further developed and refined in Dupuis and Ellis <ref> [7] </ref>, which through working examples, shapes a useful approach for proving large deviations in the space of sample paths.

Reference-contexts: Unless specified otherwise, when we speak of MGP in this paper, we always mean the usual 'linear' D E [0; 1)-MGP as defined on page 173, Ethier and Kurtz <ref> [8] </ref>); when we speak of operators, their graphs are always subsets in B (E) fi B (E). We are going to prove results slightly more general than claimed in the title of the paper large deviations for stochastic processes that are solutions of martingale problems rather than just Markov processes. <p> It is important to note that the difference, however, is really insignificant uniqueness of the solution of a martingale problem always implies the Markov property ( see Theorem 4.2, 9 10 Chapter 4 of Ethier and Kurtz <ref> [8] </ref>); and for any Markov process, there exists a martingale problem ( Proposition 1.7, Chapter 4 of Ethier and Kurtz [8]). Assumption 2.1 There exists a solution of the D E [0; 1)-MGP for (A; D (A)) with initial value X (0) = x for every x 2 E. <p> difference, however, is really insignificant uniqueness of the solution of a martingale problem always implies the Markov property ( see Theorem 4.2, 9 10 Chapter 4 of Ethier and Kurtz <ref> [8] </ref>); and for any Markov process, there exists a martingale problem ( Proposition 1.7, Chapter 4 of Ethier and Kurtz [8]). Assumption 2.1 There exists a solution of the D E [0; 1)-MGP for (A; D (A)) with initial value X (0) = x for every x 2 E. <p> This proposition holds true even without assuming the space to be complete (Chapter 3, Corollary 2.3, Ethier and Kurtz <ref> [8] </ref>). 19 2.3 A Class of Girsanov Type Transformations Given a strictly positive function h, consider the perturbation of a solution of the D E [0; T ] -martingale problem for (A; D (A)) in the following sense: assume that h 2 D (A), h &gt; 0 and D (A) is <p> The first assertion follows from 4.3.2 of Ethier and Kurtz <ref> [8] </ref>. To prove the second assertion, we note first that P, Q are equivalent mea sures in any finite time interval [0,T], R (t) is locally bounded. <p> Remark: A kind of converse to the above Lemma is also true, see Theorem 5.4 in Chapter 4 of Ethier and Kurtz <ref> [8] </ref>. This converse is particularly useful in verifying the existence of martingale problems. The next theorem is an operator analogue of the duality between real functions e r = sup u&gt;0 fur (u log u u)g and u log u u = sup r2 (1;1) fur e r g. <p> It can be shown that (S; d) is complete separable then. All these can be found in Ethier and Kurtz <ref> [8] </ref>. 3.2 The Convergence of H n s and L n s under the Large Deviation Scaling It is only natural to prove large deviations if the associated random sequence satisfies a law of large numbers. <p> Since the fP g 1 ;:::;g m n gs are exponentially tight, they are tight, which implies that they are relatively compact. Applying Theorem 8.10 in Chapter 4 of Ethier and Kurtz <ref> [8] </ref>, therefore X n ) x in distribution under the probability measures fP g 1 ;:::;g m n g. Proof Complete. Next, we classify the sample paths in C E [0; T ] in terms of a deterministic controlled martingale problem generated by ^ A. 1. <p> Denote E 1 n = f! : d (X n ; x) &lt; ffig. From the same lemma, it is known that X n ) x. With reference to the Skorohod Representation Theorem (Theorem 3.1.2, Ethier and Kurtz <ref> [8] </ref>), we may assume without lose of generality that X n s and the x 56 live on the same probability space and X n ! x almost surely. Therefore, P g 1 ;:::;g m n ) ! 1. <p> By Theorem 5.4 of Chapter 4 Ethier and Kurtz <ref> [8] </ref>, there exists fx n g C E [0; T ], such that (x n ; n ) 2 K, we prove that the fx n g is relatively compact. <p> K 2 ) (1 + M + 1) + Constantg; 60 where the last step used Assumption 3.16 and estimate in ( 3.6.10) Z K 1 (u) n (du fi ds) Ufi [0;T ] 1 + M + 1: Theorem 9.1 and 9.4 of Chapter 3 of Ethier and Kurtz <ref> [8] </ref> give the relative compactness of the fx n g (one should think of the probability laws involved are degenerate point mass and then apply the theorems). Therefore there exists a y 2 C E [0; T ] and a subsequence x n (k) ! y. <p> When n ; b n are continuous and satisfy j n (x)j 2 K n (1 + jxj 2 ) for some constants K n however, we can actually conclude that X n (t) never hits , hence is R d -valued process (Theorem 5.3.10, Ethier and Kurtz <ref> [8] </ref>). We don't assume this here. To simplify notations, unless specified otherwise, we will continue the use of A n (but it is meant to be A n ). In particular, 1 2 D now and A n 1 = 0 under this extension. <p> By a generalized version of Gronwall's inequality (see Appendix 5, Ethier and Kurtz <ref> [8] </ref>), x (t) = y (t) for any t T . Therefore, Assumption 3.18 is satisfied. Assumption 3.17 is also satisfied. <p> by I (x) = 2 0 This is the more well known representation that was used in Wentzell and Freidlin [10]. 4.2 Degenerate Diffusions Without pursuing maximal generality, let's consider the following one dimensional degenerate diffusions which come as models for population genetics, see Chapter 10 of Ethier and Kurtz <ref> [8] </ref>. Assume that fX n g solve the martingale problem for the following A n with initial values X n (0) = x 0 2 (0; 1) (we will denote E = [0; 1]). <p> Since b (x) is Lipstchiz on [0; 1] and q x (1 x) is locally Lipstchiz in any closed interval that does not contain 0 and 1, a version of the Gronwall's inequality (see Appendix 5. Ethier and Kurtz <ref> [8] </ref>) and square integrability of u () give local uniqueness when x 0 is bounded away from 0 or 1. 4.3 Upper Bound For a Particle Example: McKean Vlasov Limit In Dawson and Gartner [3], the authors consider large deviations of the McK-ean - Vlasov limit (N ! 1) of N <p> Theorem 3.2 of Ethier and Kurtz [9] and Theorem 4.4.1 of Ethier and Kurtz <ref> [8] </ref> imply that for each fixed initial distribution, there exists a unique process (a Fleming-Viot process) in C P (E) [0; 1) that solves the martingale problem for A N . Denote f N ()g as the process with deterministic initial value N (0) = 0 2 P (E).

Reference-contexts: Therefore, Assumption 3.18 is satisfied. Assumption 3.17 is also satisfied. Therefore, according to the large deviation theorem proved, fX n g satisfies a LDP with rate functional given by I (x) = 2 0 This is the more well known representation that was used in Wentzell and Freidlin <ref> [10] </ref>. 4.2 Degenerate Diffusions Without pursuing maximal generality, let's consider the following one dimensional degenerate diffusions which come as models for population genetics, see Chapter 10 of Ethier and Kurtz [8]. <p> This generator approach allows us to treat the LDPs of processes defined on general state spaces (i.e. complete separable metric space). Note that however, to get the lower bound, some regularity requirements is needed. The treatise of Freidlin and Wentzell <ref> [10] </ref> is our reference on LDPs for R d valued 97 98 nondegenerate diffusions. At many places, our approach was strongly influenced by the book. There has been much progress in the large deviation literature after the book was written, in particular we should mention the projective limit approach.

Reference-contexts: &lt; f; g &gt; A is a bilinear form, to show ( 2.1.3), it suffices to prove that &lt; M f ; M f &gt; (t) = 0 First, we note that fM f (X (t))g 2 0 is a martingale (See the proof of Theorem 1.1, Fukushima and Stroock <ref> [11] </ref>). This martingale is zero at t = 0. Second, it is easily checked that R t (X (s))ds is predictable and of finite variation. The uniqueness of the sharp bracket process under these conditions implies ( 2.1.5), hence ( 2.1.3). <p> Proof: With very minor modifications, this Proposition is essentially Corollary 1.2 in Fukushima and Stroock <ref> [11] </ref>.

The rest of the proof follows those in Proposition 2.6. Proof Complete. Via the same argument as in Lemma 2.7, we can prove its counterpart in the control setting. <p> Proposition 2.22 (Compactness on level sets) Assume E is compact, then under Assumptions 2.10 through 2.20, for each 2 P (E) and K 2 (0; 1), T;K and " T;K are compact. Proof: The proof is basically given by Theorem 1.3 in Kurtz <ref> [13] </ref>. Under the assumption 2.20, Lemma 7.4 in Dupuis and Ellis [7] should be used to replace the estimate (1.13) in Kurtz [13], which gives the relative compactness of the M-marginal distributions.

Remark: This representation of H reminds us strongly of a control problem (see the Nisio semigroup formulation for controlled Markov processes - Kurtz <ref> [13] </ref>). In fact, if we pose the control problem in terms of maximizing reward rather than minimizing cost, H is then exactly a Nisio semigroup generator, with g as the controller and Lg (x) the infinitesimal reward. This interpretation provides the intuition for our formulation of the LDP. <p> Noting that Assumptions 2.19 and 2.20 hold, apply (1.13) and (1.14) in the proof of Theorem 1.3 in Kurtz <ref> [13] </ref> to this deterministic case (replace the measure P there by point mass), therefore there exist a subsequence n (k), a x 2 C E [0; T ] and a 2 M such that d (x n (k) ; x) ! 0 and ( n (k) ; ) ! 0. <p> Suppose that f 2 D (H) and x 0 2 E, then lim (S (t)f f )(x 0 )=t = Cf (x 0 ) = lim ( ~ S (t)f f )(x 0 )=t: (5.1.1) Proof: We refer to Kurtz <ref> [13] </ref> for a proof of the semigroup property.

Proposition 5.7 Assume the conditions of Proposition 5.5. Let g 2 C (E). If uniqueness of the viscosity solution in ( 5.1.2), with h replaced by (h + g), holds for all ff &gt; 0 big enough. Then S (t)g = ~ S (t)g for each t 0. <p> If uniqueness of the viscosity solution in ( 5.1.2), with h replaced by (h + g), holds for all ff &gt; 0 big enough. Then S (t)g = ~ S (t)g for each t 0. Proof: Noting that Cf = hH (f), the rest essentially follows from Kurtz <ref> [13] </ref>. 5.2 Lower Bound and Viscosity Solutions Lemma 5.8 Let (S; d) be a metric space, define function I (): S ! [1; +1]. For any given subset K S, the followings are equivalent: 1. <p> x 0 2 E, define S i (t)g (x 0 ) = inff Z c i (x (s); u)(du fi ds) + g (x (t)) : (x; ) 2 J ; x (0) = x 0 g: Then the same argument used to verify the Nisio semigroup property in Kurtz <ref> [13] </ref> gives inff X Z (L (x (s); u) + h i (x (s)))(du fi ds) : (x; ) 2 J ; x (0) = x 0 g Similarly define ~ S i (t)s, when controls are restricted to be in K. We have a corresponding identity also.

Reference-contexts: It has been proved (Sheu <ref> [15] </ref>) that the generator H characterizes a logarithmic transformation of exit probability from certain region for the Markov process X. Further, a control problem formulation can be attached through a variational equality ( 2.4.7) (see Sheu [15]). <p> It has been proved (Sheu <ref> [15] </ref>) that the generator H characterizes a logarithmic transformation of exit probability from certain region for the Markov process X. Further, a control problem formulation can be attached through a variational equality ( 2.4.7) (see Sheu [15]). In Chapter 2, we will also introduce the dual ( 2.4.8) to this variational equality. This dual essentially summarizes the information on large deviations in the limit, if a sequence of processes are given. <p> Chapter 6 Conclusions The use of control techniques to treat large deviation problems can be traced back to Fleming and Sheu's investigation of large deviations for exit probabilities of Markov processes (see, for example Sheu <ref> [15] </ref>). Ideas and techniques along this line are further developed and refined in Dupuis and Ellis [7], which through working examples, shapes a useful approach for proving large deviations in the space of sample paths.
