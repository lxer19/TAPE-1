Abstract: Natural images contain characteristic statistical regularities that set them apart from purely random images. Understanding what these regularities are can enable natural images to be coded more efficiently. In this paper, we describe some of the forms of structure that are contained in natural images, and we show how these are related to the response properties of neurons at early stages of the visual system. Many of the important forms of structure require higher-order (i.e., more than linear, pairwise) statistics to characterize, which makes models based on linear Hebbian learning, or principal components analysis, inappropriate for finding efficient codes for natural images. We suggest that a good objective for an efficient coding of natural scenes is to maximize the sparseness of the representation, and we show that a network that learns sparse codes of natural scenes succeeds in developing localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields similar to those in the primate striate cortex.

Reference-contexts: That is, the probability distribution of activity on any given coefficient should be highly peaked around zero, with heavy tails (Fig. 3b). Such a distribution has low entropy, and so will also reduce statistical dependencies among units <ref> [2] </ref>. 4 structures, such as step edges, have phase-aligned Fourier components. b, Oriented structures require at least three-point statistics to characterize. To demonstrate this fact, two types of statistics were collected on the squiggly-lines image shown (top), and images were synthesized from these statistics.

Note that these functions represent the feedforward weighting function contributing to each unit's output, and hence are not strictly equivalent to the unit's "receptive field" because the recurrence and sparseness terms of Eq. 3 would also need to be taken into account.
