Abstract: 1 Abstract Ultrasonic imaging of esh and blood is vulnerable to the natural variability of these media: the speed of sound is not known, not constant, and not amenable to calibration using simply shaped manufactured samples. When images of high dimensional accuracy are needed, as for image-guided surgery, the average or typical values used in diagnostic ultrasound may not be good enough. In this paper we identify the main sources of uncertainty, and we suggest and model experimental approaches to in situ calibration.
