Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This document describes the user interface of the implementation of TEMPEST for spatially explicit modeling of ecological phenomena as detailed in Szymanski and Caraco, <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> The parameters contained in the file specify: 5 * the weights used in computing state transition probabilities, as found in <ref> [3] </ref>. * sequencing of transitions within the discrete time simulation tick. * version dependent information, we reserve the right in the future to allow additional controls to be added to the simulation, and to maintain backward compatibility we employ a version number at the start of the parameter file. <p> Continuous values are represented by real numbers (that is numbers with a decimal point). For references on the continuous simulation control parameters see <ref> [3] </ref>. A sample file is found in Figure 1. 6 Configuration File Format The states in the model are numbered from 0 to 8 in the implementation. In the description [3] the states are numbered from 1 to 9. <p> For references on the continuous simulation control parameters see <ref> [3] </ref>. A sample file is found in Figure 1. 6 Configuration File Format The states in the model are numbered from 0 to 8 in the implementation. In the description [3] the states are numbered from 1 to 9. The mapping between the two values is obtained by adding or subtracting 1 (depending on direction). The configuration file contains the initial states of every simulated site. <p> Relative patchiness, see [2]. * F : Fractal dimension, see [1]. * Associated image component labeling stuff (largest patch area, smallest patch area, largest patch perimeter, smallest patch perimeter, etc.): See [1] These are performed for clusters of each of the four species (good host, bad host, pathogen, parasite), see <ref> [3] </ref>. * State transition counts : 12 9.2 What the Column Labels Mean This part of the document describes the column headings, to allow the users to interpret the data, and apply a spread sheet for data management. <p> Some of the measurements are repeated, those measurements use the notation X [Y ] where X is repeated for various values of the subscript, Y . The following values are used as subscripts: * State States map to the values presented in <ref> [3] </ref>, and are as shown in * Species Numerical values are used to represent each of the individual species in the simulation. The following numbering convention presented in Table 1.
