Abstract: Two self-organising controller networks are presented in this study. The "Clustered Controller Network" (CCN) uses a spatial clustering approach to select the controllers at each instant. In the other gated controller network, the "Models-Controller Network" (MCN), it is the performance of the model attached to each controller which is used to achieve the controller selection. An algorithm to automaticly conctrust the architecture of both networks is described. It makes the two schemes self-organising. Different examples of control of non-linear systems are considered in order to illustrate the behaviour of the ICCN and the IMCN. It makes clear that both these schemes are performing much better than a single adaptive controller. The two main advantages of the ICCN over the IMCN concern the possibilities to use any controller as a building block of its network architecture and to apply the ICCN for modelling purpose. However the ICCN appears to have serious problems to cope with non-linear systems having more than a single variable implying a non-linear behaviour. The IMCN does not suffer from this trouble. This high sensitivity to the clustering space order is the main drawback limiting the use of the ICCN and therefore makes the IMCN a much more suitable approach to control a wide range of non-linear systems.

Reference-contexts: This makes these approaches very suitable for online control purposes. Another advantage of these algorithms is that they do not suffer from the "stability-plasticity dilemma" which is a basic design problem for learning machine as emphasised by <ref> (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1988) </ref>: while the model is adapting to an operating region of the system it is forgetting previous adaptations regarding other regions. The LCN and MSM are not exposed to this dilemma because each model-controller is specially adapted for a different operating region of the system. <p> This resulted in a control performance worse than during the second sequence. This effect is a basic machine learning problem referred as the "stability-plasticity dilemma" <ref> (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1988) </ref>. The top subplot depicts the control performance of an adaptive controller (preadapted from the system (1) linearisation achieved around y = 0) concerning three consecutive control sequences.

Reference-contexts: This is to avoid the normalisation of the clustering space (as it is achieved when applying the local models network or local controller network (see for instance <ref> (Johansen and Foss, 1993) </ref>). The parameter ff in 8 The output of each selected controller u is weighted by the activity w of its connected rbf. Hence, the output of the network is a sum of the weighted output of the two selected controllers.

Reference-contexts: Note that this neighbour relationship between rbfs leads to an architecture that could be related to a Kohonen's neural network (see <ref> (Kohonen, 1982) </ref> for details about this neural network). Now, by relating a different controller to each rbf we end up with a Clustered Controller Network (CCN) (see figure 6). Since at each instant only two rbfs are selected, the two controllers attached to those rbfs are activated as well.

Reference-contexts: The control version of the LMN is the "Local Controller Network" (LCN). The idea underlying the other network was introduced in <ref> (Middleton et al., 1988) </ref> and further extended in (Morse, 1990; Morse et al., 1992; Weller and Goodwin, 1994) and coined as the "hysteresis switching algorithm". <p> Hence, this scheme implies the selection of only one controller at each instant implies far more computations than the selection of the controller using the clustering approach described in the previous section. Note that the "hysteresis" feature, introduced in <ref> (Middleton et al., 1988) </ref> and use also in the MSM, is not involved in the MCN. The hysteresis is a time delay between the selection of a new controller and its activation. This is to avoid instability that could arise from a quick change of controllers.

Reference-contexts: The modelling performance index used to select the controllers is much simpler than the one used in the MSM. Another difference is that in the MCN all the model-controller pairs are adaptive. Referring to the stability results obtained and described in <ref> (Narendra and Balakrishan, 1997) </ref>, an important advantage of this scheme is the insurance of stability. However one must be careful with this result.

Reference-contexts: The LCN and MSM are not exposed to this dilemma because each model-controller is specially adapted for a different operating region of the system. Hence, and as highlighted by <ref> (Narendra et al., 1995) </ref>, these two schemes can be adapted for different discontinuities of the system. However, to make the LCN and MSM self-organising requires a general and systematic method to automatically construct their network architecture. <p> Such a method can only be effective if the dynamics of the system are changing smoothly and quite slowly through time. Therefore, if the function is discontinuous adaptive control can not be applied. In addition, the slowness of such an adaptation may result in a large transient error <ref> (Narendra et al., 1995) </ref>. This is illustrated in figure 2. The adaptive 4 controller has been preadapted from a linearisation of the system around y = 0 (see left bottom plot of this figure). Hence the controller performs well in the operating region where the lin-earisation is valid. <p> By removing the INC one makes the MCN entering a generalisation stage. Note also that a similar technique than the INC is reported in <ref> (Narendra et al., 1995) </ref>. However, their method contains no pruning feature.

Reference-contexts: Therefore the non-linear overall model developed by those networks can be easily transformed into a non-linear controller. This is perhaps the only general and systematic approach to designing a non-linear controller out of a non-linear model. One of these neural networks is the "Local Model Network" (LMN) introduced in <ref> (Poggio and Girosi, 1990) </ref> and further extended for modelling and control purposes by (Johansen and Foss, 1993; Johansen and Foss, 1992). The control version of the LMN is the "Local Controller Network" (LCN).

Reference-contexts: Now, from the equalisation of the system model (2) and the reference model (3) we determine the linear equation describing the various local controllers composing the CCN (see for further details about this control design method chapter 2 in <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref>): u = b You see from this equation that the control design is only a matter of determining the value of the model parameters a, b and c. <p> <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref>): u = b You see from this equation that the control design is only a matter of determining the value of the model parameters a, b and c. The singular value decomposition method is used in this study for the estimation of these parameters (see chapter 2 in (Ronco, 1997)). <p> Similarly to the LMN, the selection of the controllers in the CCN is achieved through a clustering of the operating space. As discussed in (Ronco et al., 1996a) and extensively in <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref> (chapter 1), the use of radial basis functions (rbfs) for the clustering is most effective for single dimensional space. A compromise between approximation and clustering quality has to be found for clustering spaces of dimensions superior to one. <p> Bear in mind again, that although we are going to deal with the CCN, most of the features that are going to be exposed here applies also to the Clustered Models Network (CMN). As discussed in <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref> (chapter 1) an homogeneous spread of the basis functions is not a sensible approach because the non-linearity of a system and the input-output samples are not homogeneously spread. A small region can be highly non-linear whereas a large region can be almost linear. <p> Both these problems would affect the parameter approximation quality of the controllers composing the network. Therefore it is vital to find out the required number of controllers and their region of validity in order to efficiently apply a controller network. Note that during the literature review preformed in <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref> (chapter 2) it was emphasised that there is no general and systematic approach to solve that clustering problem. 10 To determine the architecture of a CCN without any a priori knowledge about the system is indeed a non-trivial problem. <p> A linear controller is then designed from this model. Any conventional control design methods can be used (e.g. pole placement, Model Reference Adaptive Controller. The latter is used in this study. Details about this control design approach can be found in the <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref> (chapter 1). A rbf is centred on the current operating condition and its width is set to almost zero. The new controller-rbf pair is finally added to the CCN. These features are the basis of the "Incremental Network Construction" (INC). <p> This is indeed arbitrary but sufficient in most cases to remove the undesirable controllers. A better criteria could be found in the singularity vector expressed by the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method used for the models approximation (see <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref> (chapter 2) for details). However this possibility has not been sufficiently investigate to be exposed here. <p> This is however a common feature with another neural network which also applies a gating approach to select different computing modules at each instant: the "Hierarchical Mixture of Experts" algorithm developed by (Jacobs and Jordan, 1993) and extensively described in <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref> (chapter 1). 4.3 Illustration In order to illustrate the capability of the INC associated to the CCN we will consider the control of the first order system (1) used in the first section of this article. <p> Rather than clustering on multiple quantities one should use an other approach to select the models/controllers. A clustering free approach is described next. 5 Incremental Model-Controller Network The "Multiple Switched Model" (MSM) has been extensively studied in (Narendra et al., 1995; Narendra and Balakrishan, 1997) (See <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref> (chapter 1) for details about this algorithm). The MSM is a network of model-controller pairs where each controller is designed from its connected model (See figure 13). There are various possibilities while composing the network. <p> From those samples a local model of the system is determined. A linear controller is then designed from this model. Similar to the CCN, a Model Reference Adaptive Controller design method is used in this study (see <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref> (chapter 2) for details about this control design method).

This information is contained in the singular vector given by the SVD whilst approximating the parameters of the models associated with the controllers (see <ref> (Ronco, 1997) </ref> (chapter 2) for details). Both the ICCN and the IMCN offer several important advantages compared to other approaches.
