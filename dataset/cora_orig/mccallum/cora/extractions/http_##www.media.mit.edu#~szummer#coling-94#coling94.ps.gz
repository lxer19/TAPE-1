Abstract: We present an approach to natural language understanding based on a computable grammar of constructions. A construction consists of a set of features of form and a description of meaning in a context. A grammar is a set of constructions. This kind of grammar is the key element of mincal, an implemented natural language speech-enabled interface to an online calendar system. The architecture has two key aspects: (a) the use of constructions, integrating descriptions of form, meaning and context into one whole; and (b) the separation of domain knowledge (about calendars) from application knowledge (about the particular on-line calendar).

Reference-contexts: Hence, although the parser does not have a lookahead step at present, such a step can be added following [2]. 4 Comparisons with related work Linguistic arguments for constructions-based grammars has been worked out chiefly by Ch. Fillmore and his colleagues (cf. <ref> [3] </ref>). Their motivation for advocating such an approach comes from the fact that typical generative theories of grammar cannot deal properly with open idioms illustrated by constructions such as: The more carefully you work, the easier it will get. <p> The reason for this failure can be attributed to the fact that expressions like these "exhibit properties that are not fully predictable from independently known properties of its lexical makeup and its grammatical structure" - <ref> [3] </ref>, p.511. However we do not need a list of "strange" constructions to conclude that thoroughly integrating syntax with semantics and pragmatics could provide us with a better handle on natural language understanding.

Reference-contexts: We claim that the same representation scheme can be used for all constructions. The examples we are going to present have been developed with a specific purpose in mind, namely for scheduling calendar events. In other papers ([10] and <ref> [6] </ref>), we have presented examples showing that we can give a good descriptions of non-standard constructions. However, in either case descriptions of meanings and contexts are general, and hence applicable to other tasks. We now turn our attention to words.

Reference-contexts: describe two key aspects of the system architecture: (a) the use of constructions, where instead of separating NL processing into the phases of syntax, semantics and pragmatics, we integrate descriptions of form, meaning and context into one whole, and use a parser that takes into account all this information (see <ref> [10] </ref> for details); (b) the separation of the domain knowledge (about calendars) and the application knowledge (about the particular on-line calendar). fl M. Szummer and S. Jarecki are also from MIT. <p> However we do not need a list of "strange" constructions to conclude that thoroughly integrating syntax with semantics and pragmatics could provide us with a better handle on natural language understanding.

Jurafsky [4] has independently come up with a proposal for a computable grammar of constructions. We compare our work with his in [10]. Here, we limit ourselves to a few remarks. What is common in both approaches is the centrality of the concept of grammatical construction as a data structure that represents lexical, semantic and syntactic knowledge. However, there are important differences between the two formalisms. <p> For us the important feature of "abstract" constructions is not that they simplify descriptions of other constructions, but that they have default meanings.

State of the art systems typically are too "syntax-driven", failing to take context into account in determining the intended meaning of sentences.
