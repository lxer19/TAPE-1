Abstract: With the fast advance of real-time computer graphics, head-mounted displays (HMDs) have become popular tools for 3D visualization. One of the most promising and challenging future uses of HMDs, however, is in applications where virtual environments enhance rather then replace real environments. The difficulty comes from the fact that the relative registration of real and virtual environments is a difficult task to perform from both a computational and a perceptual point of view, those being tightly correlated. Given a computational model for stereoscopic viewing, a better understanding of depth and size perception in virtual environments is called for, as well as the relationships between perceived depths and sizes of real and virtual objects sharing a common visual space. This paper first discusses the important parameters within the model that need to be carefully evaluated and set for accurate calibration of the system. We then describe the experimental paradigm used for assessing depth perception of two generic objects, in this case a cube and a cylinder. Finally, experimental results of perceived depth of real and virtual generic objects are presented.

Reference-contexts: Even though the simplest optical system, known as the p i n h o l e c a m e r a <ref> (Barrett and Swindell, 1981) </ref> reduces to a single point that serves as the center of projection or eyepoint, this is generally not the case of most optical systems.

Reference-contexts: While the eyes have a wide latitude in fusing images of various degrees of lateral shifts, the slightest difference in vertical position causes eye strains, possibly headaches, and if the discrepancy is more than 0.34 degree visual angle the time needed to fuse the images increases exponentially <ref> (Burton and Home, 1980) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A variant of the above technique could also be used to verify the FOV of the system <ref> (Ellis, 1993) </ref>. It consists of comparing the size of a virtual object with that of a real identical object, again under monocular viewing.

Reference-contexts: The displays used for the study were Memorex LCD color displays, while the computer graphics were generated by Pixel Plane 5, a massively parallel graphics engine developed at UNC-CH under the direction of Henry Fuchs and John Poulton <ref> (Fuchs et al., 1989) </ref>. In addition, the geometry adopted for the layout of the optical system allowed us to eliminate lateral misalignments that are often found in commercially available systems.

Reference-contexts: Haines and colleagues have shown, however, that despite the fact that pilots are supposed to have access to symbology and physical targets information at the same time, symbology most often captures the pilots attention and targets are being missed <ref> (Haines et al. 1980) </ref>. This simple example suggests that superimposing virtual and real information in an effective manner is difficult to achieve. Moreover, effectiveness needs to be measured in terms of the task to be performed.

Reference-contexts: For the purpose of accurate calibration of HMDs, the eyepoint for perspective projection used in the computational model must be defined in terms of a precise location within the eye, a standard eye being about 25 mm in diameter <ref> (Levine, 1985) </ref>. There is much controversy in the literature about which point within the eye must be chosen for the center of projection.

Reference-contexts: An optical system can be described most generally by its principal points, its nodal points, and its focal length ; A good review of the basics of geometrical optics can be found in <ref> (Longhurst, 1973) </ref>. Lets first consider a monocular system. Given the position of the display screen with respect to the first (object) principal point of the optics, the position -5- and size of the virtual image can be determined with respect to the second (image) principal point.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, most stereoscopes are so adjusted that the viewing lenses act as collimators <ref> (McKay, 1948) </ref>. With respect to the two eyes combined, vision in HMDs is similar to our vision in the real world in that convergence is driven by the location of the 3D objects perceived from the disparate monocular images.

Reference-contexts: This is of importance since it is commonly known that the binocular observation of a red light and a blue light, located at the same physical depth, often will cause the red one to appear closer than the blue, phenomenon known as chromostereopsis <ref> (Vos, 1960) </ref>. Experimental data reported by Vos show that the maximum amplitude of the effect over 4 observers was 4 mm at 0.8 m viewing distance. Moreover, half of the observers reported that the red object ( a slit in Voss case) was perceived behind the blue slit.
