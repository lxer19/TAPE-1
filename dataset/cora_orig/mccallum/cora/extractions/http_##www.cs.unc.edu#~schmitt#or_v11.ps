Title: Solving the Temporal Binding Problem: A Neural Theory for Constructing and Updating Object Files  
Author: Charles P. Schmitt Jonathan A. Marshall 
Date: October 19, 1998  
Abstract: Visual objects are perceived only if their parts are correctly identified and integrated. A neural network theory is proposed that seeks to explain how the human visual system binds together visual properties, dispersed over space and time, of multiple objects a problem known as the temporal binding problem [49, 30]. The proposed theory is based upon neural mechanisms that construct and update object representations through the interactions of a serial attentional mechanism for location and object-based selection, preattentive Gestalt-based grouping mechanisms, and an associative memory structure that binds together object identity, form, and spatial information. A working model is presented that provides a unified quantitative explanation of results from psychophysical experiments on object review, object integration and multielement tracking.

Reference-contexts: The preattentive mechanism appears to integrate features on the basis of coarser location information than used by the serial mechanism <ref> [7, 1] </ref>. Based on the biological findings that show attention-based enhancement of neural activity, it seems likely that the serial mechanism is mediated by enhancement of mean firing rates.

Reference-contexts: Neurobiological findings are consistent with the view that the visual system generates spatio-temporal based predictions. Assad and Maunsell <ref> [2] </ref> showed that areas involved in visuo-spatial processing contain neurons that respond to anticipated motions. The areas showing this property provide input to, and receive feedback from, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

Reference-contexts: First, several researchers have reported that prefrontal cortex is subdivided into regions containing neurons responsive to, and having delayed-period activation for, either spatial information (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) or object information (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) <ref> [53, 44, 3] </ref>. The second finding of interest concerns the delay-period activations. Neurons active during these periods are responsive to different objects and locations and the same neurons repeatedly codes the same location or object [14, 53].

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, it is difficult to directly relate findings from other tasks to the experiments simulated in this paper. Consider experiments by Bennett and Wolfe <ref> [4] </ref> in which subjects had to identify a rotated T among rotated Ls where the letters were sequentially revealed. By varying the rate at which letters were revealed, Bennett and Wolfe's results suggest subjects discriminated the rotated Ts and Ls at a rate between 26 and 50 msec.

Reference-contexts: This result is not surprising given that object identity is closely tied to perceived location [22] and that motion perception is only weakly influenced by object form <ref> [5, 34, 27] </ref>. These results indicate that the primary factor involved in solving the memory correspondence problem is 11 the predictivity of the location and motion of objects in memory.

Reference-contexts: The closeness of the required match that determines whether a new representation is formed or whether an existing representation is updated can be controlled by an adaptive parameter (similar to the vigilance parameter in ART networks <ref> [6] </ref>). If the selection is object-based, the firing rate of the neuron within the associated network encoding the selected object is enhanced. In this case, the representation of the attended object will be updated regardless of how well the input matches the stored representation.

Reference-contexts: The preattentive mechanism appears to integrate features on the basis of coarser location information than used by the serial mechanism <ref> [7, 1] </ref>. Based on the biological findings that show attention-based enhancement of neural activity, it seems likely that the serial mechanism is mediated by enhancement of mean firing rates.

Reference-contexts: The serial versus parallel question is, in essence, the question of whether one or more populations of neurons are labeled by the binding mechanism. Neurobiological data exists that supports both approaches. Several studies <ref> [26, 33, 51, 8] </ref> have shown that when attention is directed at specific visual elements, neurons responding to those elements become more active. <p> Finally, neurobiological findings shows that attention-specific enhanced activation exists in prefrontal cortex [13] in addition to findings showing such enhancement occurs in the areas of the dorsal and ventral pathways <ref> [51, 26, 33, 8] </ref> that process object form and object location/motion information and that 10 have recurrent connections with prefrontal cortex. In summary, these findings support the idea presented in this paper that working representations of objects are constructed and updated through attentional enhancement of mean firing rates.

Reference-contexts: In a latter surprise recognition test, subjects typically recognized the attended object, but not the unattended object. This result occurred even if the unattended object had a recognizable shape such as a Christmas tree. The results of Rock were recently confirmed by DeSchepper and Treisman <ref> [10] </ref>. They also showed, however, that reaction times on subsequent visual tasks were slowed if the unattended object was present (a case of negative priming) indicating that some memory trace was formed of the unattended object. Like Rock, however, they found that recognition was not effected by the unattended object.

Reference-contexts: The second and third assumptions both have support through psychophysical experiments (see <ref> [11, 25] </ref> for reviews) while the first assumption is suggested by findings showing attention-related enhancement in neural firing [33, 26]. <p> This paper assumes the simpler case of direct enhancement. 26 The fourth assumption is one of current debate. Several studies on visual search and RSVP (rapid visual search presentation) lead to dwell times for attention ranging from 17 msec. to 500 msec. (see <ref> [11] </ref> for a recent review). Unfortunately, it is difficult to directly relate findings from other tasks to the experiments simulated in this paper. Consider experiments by Bennett and Wolfe [4] in which subjects had to identify a rotated T among rotated Ls where the letters were sequentially revealed.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that non-serial search can occur for objects that are differentiated on the basis of complex aspects; for example, searches on geometric forms lit from different directions <ref> [12] </ref> yield results suggestive of parallel search. The search results have been taken to indicate that some level of parallel processing occurs in which perceptually related elements are grouped prior to attentional selection [18, 48].

Reference-contexts: This last category of cells was termed 'what-where' cells as the neurons were highly selective for both object and location, suggesting these cells integrate spatial and non-spatial object information in memory. Finally, neurobiological findings shows that attention-specific enhanced activation exists in prefrontal cortex <ref> [13] </ref> in addition to findings showing such enhancement occurs in the areas of the dorsal and ventral pathways [51, 26, 33, 8] that process object form and object location/motion information and that 10 have recurrent connections with prefrontal cortex.

Reference-contexts: Studies of single neuron activity during delayed-response tasks show sustained activity during delay periods that appears to be related to performance on memory tasks <ref> [41, 14] </ref> and that is not maskable [53]. That memory-based activation in prefrontal cortex is not maskable is significant as short-term memory is defined as non-maskable (delay period activity found in inferior temporal cortex or posterior parietal cortex is maskable [53]). <p> The second finding of interest concerns the delay-period activations. Neurons active during these periods are responsive to different objects and locations and the same neurons repeatedly codes the same location or object <ref> [14, 53] </ref>. Third, Rao et al. [38] have found that neurons showing delay-period activation appear to be encoding either object information, location information, or both object and location information.

Reference-contexts: First, it is posited that grouping is mediated through modulatory pathways that allow enhanced firing rates within a neural population to spread to other populations that signal perceptual related elements. The horizontal connections that run between areas of V1 encoding edges of similar orientation <ref> [15] </ref> serves as an example; although, more complex circuitries are not excluded (e.g., circuitry mediating percepts such as amodal completion).

Reference-contexts: Support for this claim comes from several lines of research. Lesions of prefrontal cortex produce severe impairments on spatial memory tasks [35] and on nonspatial, object-based memory tasks [32] that require holding or updating information 9 over a short period of time (for review see <ref> [16] </ref>). <p> For a more complete review of evidence for the role of prefrontal cortex in working memory, see <ref> [52, 16] </ref>. Several findings concerning prefrontal cortex are of particular interest in guiding a model for linking object identity with shape and spatial information.

Reference-contexts: Changes in connection weight are governed by correlation-based rules. Feedforward connections to neurons in the association network are strengthened if pre and post-synaptic firing rates are both enhanced and weakened if post-synaptic firing rates are enhanced while pre-synaptic firing rates are low (an instar learning rules <ref> [17, 29] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The search results have been taken to indicate that some level of parallel processing occurs in which perceptually related elements are grouped prior to attentional selection <ref> [18, 48] </ref>. The degree of processing appears to be quite complex, allowing three dimensional shapes to be constructed, although limited in that not all combinations of visual elements can occur without attention.

Reference-contexts: This finding suggests that, instead, associations are adaptively formed. 2.4 Predictions and the memory correspondence problem Psychophysical studies have shown that a primary factor in maintaining object identity over time is the spatio-temporal continuity of the object <ref> [20] </ref>. For example, a moving object can continuously change shape, but the object will maintain its same identity as long as the motion appears continuous. In contrast, an object that maintains its same shape but has a discontinuous motion will often be viewed as multiple objects appearing at random locations.

Reference-contexts: These experiments show that illusory conjunctions occur more frequently within, rather than between, perceptual groups and that illusory conjunctions occur more often when attention is diverted <ref> [21] </ref>. It appears, therefore, that the static binding problem is solved through the combination of a parallel mechanism that establishes input-driven groupings of visual elements and a serial mechanism that allows further processing of a specific grouping.

Reference-contexts: This requires that the visual system construct internal representations (analogous to object files <ref> [23] </ref>) that hold the features and bindings of each object and that the visual system correctly updates each representation based on the new elements and bindings computed for each new image.

Reference-contexts: The interactions also aid in solving the memory correspondence problem, thereby supporting the binding of features present at different times and solving the temporal binding problem. This paper shows that the results of experimental manipulations, such as changes in ISI and number of targets, in object review <ref> [24] </ref> and object integration [47] experiments (experiments that each require the construction and update of object 3 representations over time for multiple objects) are the result of the mechanisms involved in solving the temporal binding problem. 2 A Review of Experimental Studies and Models of Binding Psychophysical data suggesting how the <p> This paper focuses on the object review and object integration studies.

Image sequences provide input to a network composed of motion-sensitive neurons and a network composed of edge-sensitive neurons.

Reference-contexts: It appears, therefore, that the memory representation necessary for recognition is constructed serially, even though unattended objects are also processed to a limited (and not fully understood) extent. That memory representations are constructed in serial does not necessitate that representations are updated in serial. Pylyshyn and Storm <ref> [36] </ref> have argued that data from multielement tracking experiments suggest that representations are updated in parallel (see [37] for arguments not discussed here). In multi-element tracking experiments, subjects are shown several identically shaped elements and a subset of the elements are indicated as targets. <p> The elements then move independently with random changes in velocity. After several seconds of motion, subjects are asked whether a specific element is one of the initial targets. 7 Depending on display conditions, subjects can answer at above chance levels for up to seven targets <ref> [36, 56] </ref>. Pylyshyn and Storm [36] and Yantis [56] have each argued that accuracy on this task is high enough to rule out the possibility that a serial, location-based mechanism is responsible for updating the representation of each target. <p> After several seconds of motion, subjects are asked whether a specific element is one of the initial targets. 7 Depending on display conditions, subjects can answer at above chance levels for up to seven targets [36, 56].

Reference-contexts: The second finding of interest concerns the delay-period activations. Neurons active during these periods are responsive to different objects and locations and the same neurons repeatedly codes the same location or object [14, 53]. Third, Rao et al. <ref> [38] </ref> have found that neurons showing delay-period activation appear to be encoding either object information, location information, or both object and location information. <p> Spatial and shape information appears to be encoded by separate populations of neurons with relatively fixed receptive fields. The association between spatial and shape information appears to be maintained through the 'what-where' cells. The finding by Rao et al. <ref> [38] </ref> that the number of 'what-where' cells was approximately equal to the number of 'what' and 'where' cells suggests that each possible combination of object shape and location is not encoded by a different 'what-where' cell (otherwise the number of 'what-where' cells would greatly outnumber the other populations).

Reference-contexts: Studies of single neuron activity during delayed-response tasks show sustained activity during delay periods that appears to be related to performance on memory tasks <ref> [41, 14] </ref> and that is not maskable [53].

Reference-contexts: This deficit is surprising considering that the human visual system is embedded within a dynamic world where the attributes of an object are often not revealed from a single image. The research presented in this paper, and a companion paper <ref> [42] </ref>, presents a working neural theory for addressing the temporal binding problem. [Figure 1 about here.] partially occluded plus sign in frame 3. <p> The theory presented in section 3 builds upon findings from psychophysics and neurobiology, reviewed in section 2, that indicate that the short-term object representations necessary for object recognition are constructed by a serial mechanism and upon a prior version of the model <ref> [42] </ref> that shows that the update of object representations is also consistent with serial access to memory representations. The model solves the static binding problem by modulating the saliency of visual elements through the interactions of memory-based predictions, preattentive perceptual grouping mechanisms, and an attentional selection process. <p> This paper focuses on the object review and object integration studies. For results on multielement tracking experiments, see <ref> [42] </ref>. [Figure 2 about here.] In the first two experiments conducted by Kahneman et al. [24] on object review, the containing squares were stationary (figure 2A) during the linkage phase. <p> Pylyshyn and Storm [36] and Yantis [56] have each argued that accuracy on this task is high enough to rule out the possibility that a serial, location-based mechanism is responsible for updating the representation of each target. We show in a recent paper <ref> [42] </ref> that the model presented in this paper demonstrates that the data on multielement tracking is consistent with a serial, object-based mechanism for updating object representations (a claim previously suggested by Yantis [56]). 2.2 Serial and parallel mechanisms Results from visual search and illusory conjunction studies provide additional information on the <p> important test of this idea would be to determine if the responses to anticipated motions were also influenced by attentional selection. 3 Theory The theory of binding presented in this section is based upon the experimental finding reviewed in the prior section as well as prior work on multielement tracking <ref> [42] </ref>. As objects in multielement tracking experiments have identical shapes, prior work focused on the binding between object identity and spatial information. The current theory extends the prior work by focusing on the interactions between object identity, form, and motion/location. <p> An example of this comes from experiments on multielement tracking. Yantis [56] showed that the tracking accuracy of subject tracking targets that are constrained to not violate a convex hull constraint is greater than the tracking accuracy of a control group. Prior simulations of the model <ref> [42] </ref> show that this result can be explained by the lack of cooperative interaction between top-down predictions of where targets should appear and grouping mechanisms that try to bind together elements with common motion.

Reference-contexts: Such findings suggest that the population of neurons associated with the current object of attention is differentiated from other neurons on the basis of their mean firing rates. These findings suggest a serial solution. Other studies (see <ref> [43] </ref> for review) have shown that the firing of neurons signaling elements belonging to the same object can be synchronized and that this synchronization disappears when the elements no longer belong to the same object.

The second finding of interest concerns the delay-period activations.

Reference-contexts: This paper shows that the results of experimental manipulations, such as changes in ISI and number of targets, in object review [24] and object integration <ref> [47] </ref> experiments (experiments that each require the construction and update of object 3 representations over time for multiple objects) are the result of the mechanisms involved in solving the temporal binding problem. 2 A Review of Experimental Studies and Models of Binding Psychophysical data suggesting how the temporal binding problem is <p> The experimental results showed a strong object-specific benefit in almost all conditions and a weak nonspecific benefit. The two experiments show that the internal representation of the preview letters remained bound to the squares as the squares moved. In the object integration studies (figure 2C), Kahneman and Treisman <ref> [47] </ref> show that the representations of objects can be accumulated over time. The interesting finding in these studies is that subjects responded slower if a vertical and horizontal bar had appeared within the same square, indicating that the bars were integrated despite being presented at separate times and locations.

Reference-contexts: The search results have been taken to indicate that some level of parallel processing occurs in which perceptually related elements are grouped prior to attentional selection <ref> [18, 48] </ref>. The degree of processing appears to be quite complex, allowing three dimensional shapes to be constructed, although limited in that not all combinations of visual elements can occur without attention.

Reference-contexts: Experimental and theoretical research has traditionally focused on two aspects of the binding problem termed property binding and part binding (this breakdown comes from Treisman <ref> [49] </ref>). These aspects address how the different features, such as color and motion, and the different parts of objects in an image are bound together. <p> As a consequence of this focus, research on the binding problem has often ignored the question of how elements dispersed in time are bound together an aspect of the binding problem termed the temporal binding problem <ref> [49, 30] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: motions between tracked targets decreases, lowering the conflict between top-down and bottom-up processes and producing higher tracking accuracies. 4 Simulations 4.1 Methods As test of the theory presented in section 3, a seven layer neural network model was constructed and simulated on image sequences generated as described in [24] and <ref> [50] </ref>.

As such, a direct quantitative comparison is not possible. Simulation results are still presented as the general result of the original studies provide an important test of any model of temporal binding.

Reference-contexts: The serial versus parallel question is, in essence, the question of whether one or more populations of neurons are labeled by the binding mechanism. Neurobiological data exists that supports both approaches. Several studies <ref> [26, 33, 51, 8] </ref> have shown that when attention is directed at specific visual elements, neurons responding to those elements become more active. <p> Finally, neurobiological findings shows that attention-specific enhanced activation exists in prefrontal cortex [13] in addition to findings showing such enhancement occurs in the areas of the dorsal and ventral pathways <ref> [51, 26, 33, 8] </ref> that process object form and object location/motion information and that 10 have recurrent connections with prefrontal cortex. In summary, these findings support the idea presented in this paper that working representations of objects are constructed and updated through attentional enhancement of mean firing rates.

Reference-contexts: Examination of reaction times suggests that search occurs either as a serial process or a parallel process, the difference being in how the target is differentiated from the surrounding objects (although the distinction of serial vs. parallel search is questionable <ref> [55] </ref>). It has been shown that non-serial search can occur for objects that are differentiated on the basis of complex aspects; for example, searches on geometric forms lit from different directions [12] yield results suggestive of parallel search.
