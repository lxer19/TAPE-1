Reference-contexts: If the signs at the endpoints are the same we cannot n - 1+ 11 locate an intersection with the contour, though one may exist. Many attempts at a solution to this problem try to predict the occurrence of bifurcations and resample the domain in that area <ref> (Allgower and Gnutzmann 1991) </ref>. Such solutions ultimately rely on the existence of a sufficiently fine partitioning of space to capture the contour adequately. <p> Contouring simplexes avoids ambiguities that can arise when contouring a cell. There are v arious ways to perform the split of cells into simplexes <ref> (Allgower and Gnutzmann 1991) </ref>. We chose a method that can be formulated to work in arbitrary dimension and that can also be applied to other polytopes in addition to the n-cell. This section presents a general, recursi ve method for decomposing an n-cell into n-simplexes. <p> This gives f (n) = 2 n-1 n! n-simplexes from an n-cell (that f (n) = 2 n! can be shown by inductive proof). There are other techniques that generate only n! simplexes <ref> (Allgower and Gnutzmann 1991) </ref>. The midpoint scheme is therefore simple to encode but inefficient in simplex production, a familiar trade-off (simplicity versus efficiency) in computer science. <p> Assume, without loss of generality, that c = 0. We will not treat the degenerate case where f = 0 identically at all the v ertices of the simplex; the problem of such sim-plexes not transverse to f is addressed elsewhere <ref> (Allgower and Gnutzmann 1991) </ref>. This section presents a general, recursive method for contouring an n-simplex. The explanation is motivated by three e xamples, each restricted to a progressi vely larger dimension.

Reference-contexts: Does a general algorithm exist for triangulating an implicit k-manifold? Recall that the k-dimensional analogue of a surf ace is the k-manifold (so 2-manifolds are surf aces). Not all k-manifolds can be triangulated; it is kno wn that a k-manifold can be triangulated only if it is differentiable <ref> (Cairns 1935) </ref>. An implicitly-defined manifold is not guaranteed to be differentiable, so there must exist some contour (also known as an implicit surface, a level set, or a v ariety) that prevents any algorithm from triangulating it. <p> Cairns, in 1935, sho wed that if the underlying function is dif ferentiable then there 13 is guaranteed to be a triangulation of the manifold <ref> (Cairns 1935) </ref>. It is not necessarily true, however, that the manifold cannot be triangulated if it is not differentiable. In the last two decades a great deal of attention has been given to simplicial continuation methods.

Reference-contexts: As a historical note, at that time contouring techniques on a 2D grid were referred to as isarithms. Cot-tafava and Le Moli introduced a technique in the late 1960s <ref> (Cottafava and Le Moli 1969) </ref> which was one of the first use of recursive subdivision to capture contours more accurately in regions of high detail.

Reference-contexts: Medical data, such as computed tomograph y scans, would be collected as a series of 2D slices. Techniques of this decade found contours within each slice separately , then connected the contours to produce a 3D triangulation <ref> (Fuchs, K edem, and Uselton 1977) </ref>. Some difficult problems arise when contours from adjacent slices must be connected together. The topology, mesh structure, or geometry can change radically between slices, making for many possible ambiguities when connecting the contours.

Reference-contexts: Other techniques sort partitioning polytopes by span (the difference between maximum and min 17 imum function value) and by minimum function value <ref> (Gallagher 1991) </ref>. The idea of span also extends to consider coherence between neighboring polytopes, allo wing for faster constructing of subsequent contours when the iso value is varied slightly (Shen and Johnson 1995).

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, they require prior analysis of the data to determine suf ficient seed points for the contouring to be complete. This often involves trial-and-error on the part of the user , or difficult and computationally expensive calculations to locate probable seed points to be follo wed by trial-and-error algorithms <ref> (Itoh and Koyamada 1994) </ref>. Also, multiple disconnected contours require additional searches for seed points, making the chances of missing information high. Subdivision Methods The earliest subdivision methods were used by crystallographers for the generation of contour plots of interference patterns.

Reference-contexts: Also at that time, research in displaying molecular orbitals led to polyhedral approximations of implicitly def ined models <ref> (Koide, Doi, and Kajioka 1986) </ref>. Koide et al. compared polyhedral subdivision of space to propagation from seed points (subdi vision to continuation) and pointed out that the polyhedral approach, though ill suited to their graphics hardw are, is more compact and simpler to implement.

Reference-contexts: Such solutions ultimately rely on the existence of a sufficiently fine partitioning of space to capture the contour adequately. Costlier strategies exist, such as solving for the zero-crossings numerically <ref> (Krishnan and Manocha 1997) </ref>, but these are not always convenient to apply to the given data. one of two ways. The grey vertex could be negative (white) causing the bottom branch to be missed, or it could be positive (black) causing bifurcation to be contoured as two separate line-segments.

Reference-contexts: Either decision is arbitrary, though it can be made consistently gi ven no further information. There are techniques for making the decision based on the behavior of the function being contoured (Nielsen and Hamman 1991). One common technique for unambiguously contouring cells is to use a multi-entry look-up table <ref> (Ning and Bloomenthal 1992) </ref>. Tables are indexed by an encoding of the vertex signs and contain predetermined orderings of polytope edges, which indicate ho w to connect the intersections to construct contour polytopes. Although fast, the tables require construction and storage, and often must be constructed by hand.

Reference-contexts: As mentioned in chapter one, simplexes are much easier to contour because there are no ambiguous connectivity issues and they are guaranteed to ha ve contour-polygons which share common vertices across faces. Another advantage of the simplex is that it can easily be used to contour unstructured data <ref> (Shen and Johnson 1995) </ref>. Increasing Performance Several methods have been explored by other researchers for improving the performance of existing subdivision techniques for contouring. Since continuation techniques need not visit any region of space devoid of a contour, they are generally considered to be optimally efficient. <p> The idea of span also extends to consider coherence between neighboring polytopes, allo wing for faster constructing of subsequent contours when the iso value is varied slightly <ref> (Shen and Johnson 1995) </ref>. Extensions into Large Dimensional Spaces Over the past few years interest has been gro wing in the area of visualization of continuous data in large dimensions (Hoffman and Zhou 1991; Banks 1992; Hanson and Cross 1993; Hanson 1994). <p> Applications involving space curves, 3-manifolds, or dimensions of space larger than 4 are of particular interest. Improving Contouring Performance Bloomenthal (Bloomenthal 1988) and others <ref> (Shen and Johnson 1995) </ref> use hierarchical spatial subdivision to accelerate the e xhaustive search for polytopes containing the desired contour. This has been e xtended to a dual entry mechanism which considers spatial coherence when changing the iso value by some small v alue d (Shen and Johnson 1995). <p> Bloomenthal (Bloomenthal 1988) and others <ref> (Shen and Johnson 1995) </ref> use hierarchical spatial subdivision to accelerate the e xhaustive search for polytopes containing the desired contour. This has been e xtended to a dual entry mechanism which considers spatial coherence when changing the iso value by some small v alue d (Shen and Johnson 1995). These hierarchical techniques are of general benef it to the contouring phase. Spatial coherence is of particular interest for interactive visualization of manifolds where different isovalues are explored by the user.

Reference-contexts: On similar hardware, ISSUE, a highly optimized contouring algorithm for isosurf aces in 3D data, typically produces about 200,000 from datasets of o ver 1,200,000 cells in as little as 30 milliseconds <ref> (Shen, et al. 1996) </ref>. Figure 4.9 reiterates these comparisons. Memory Requirements Regardless of the contouring technique emplo yed, some amount of system memory must be dedicated to storage of the dataset to be contoured. An y memory required beyond this is considered the overhead required by the contouring algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Finding this envelope, given the isovol-ume defined by f 1 = 0, is a fairly simple task in 4-space. It has been observed that a point on the en velope of a swept surf ace satisfies the condition <ref> (Wang and Wang 1986) </ref>. To see why an envelope satisfies this con straint consider a time-varying 2D function f (x, y, t) = 0. At a given timestep t 0 , f (x, y, t 0 ) = 0 defines a curve.

Reference-contexts: Finding a minimal b ut complete set of seed points becomes more dif ficult as the dimension of space grows. Subdivision techniques also extend to multidimensional contouring; however, no such methods were published prior to Recursive Contour Meshing in 1996 <ref> (Weigle and Banks 1996) </ref>. Recursive Contour Meshing is the technique presented in the following chapter. Lorensen has de veloped an unpublished e xtension to Marching Cubes allowing the contouring of surf aces in four-dimensional spaces (Lorensen 1996). <p> The f irst application concerns the contouring of surf aces in 4-space, specifically complex curves in CC <ref> (Weigle and Banks 1996) </ref>. The second application deals with isosurfaces of time-varying 3D scalar fields and their envelopes (Weigle and Banks 1997). Also, this chapter presents a technique for reducing error in the triangulated contours. Finally, the new technique Recursive Contour Meshing is compared to other existing technique.
