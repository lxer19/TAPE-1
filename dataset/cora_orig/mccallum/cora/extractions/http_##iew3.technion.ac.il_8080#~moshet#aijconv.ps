Abstract: We define the notion of social conventions in a standard game-theoretic framework, and identify various criteria of consistency of such conventions with the principle of individual rationality. We then investigate the emergence of such conventions in a stochastic setting; we do so within a stylized framework currently popular in economic circles, namely that of stochastic games. This framework comes in several forms; in our setting agents interact with each other through a random process, and accumulate information about the system. As they do so, they continually reevaluate their current choice of strategy in light of the accumulated information. We introduce a simple and natural strategy-selection rule, called highest cumulative reward (HCR). We show a class of games in which HCR guarantees eventual convergence to a rationally acceptable social convention. Most importantly, we investigate the efficiency with which such social conventions are achieved. We give an analytic lower bound on this rate, and then present results about how HCR works out in practice. Specifically, we pick one of the most basic games, namely a basic coordination game (as defined by Lewis), and through extensive computer simulations determine not only the effect of applying HCR, but also the subtle effects of various system parameters, such as the amount of memory and the frequency of update performed by all agents. fl This work has been partially supported by AFOSR grant AF F49620-94-1-0090.

This game is a basic game in the study of cooperation. <p> However, we are especially interested (given our interest in symmetric games) in social laws which enable the agents to improve upon their situation. 9 By showing that cooperation is a rational convention we do not mean to imply that there are not other settings that sanction cooperation; see <ref> [2] </ref>. 10 3 Stochastic games and emergent conventions As was mentioned in the introduction, classical results in game theory make strong assumptions; in particular, they rely on the game being common knowledge. Much recent work in economics is devoted to investigating more realistic models.

It is not our claim that global information is never available to an individual in a society; counter-examples abound. However, it is clear that much of individual decision making is made in the absence of this global information, and our aim is to home in on this element. <p> However, both have been augmented to include a dynamical system. These dynamic models have also found applications in other fields. One is quantitative sociology, where the models have been used to predict opinion shifts over time within large populations [30]. Statistical mechanics also provided the inspiration to computational ecology <ref> [10] </ref>; this work is based on the idea that the existence of many agents in an advanced computerized framework creates a "computational ecology." A computational framework, similar in its spirit to quantitative sociology, is 31 developed and analyzed using the tools of statistical mechanics.

Reference-contexts: This recent work in mathematical economics is the closest in spirit to our work, and therefore we discussed it in detail previously. The way the agents update their behavior in our setting, has some similarity with learning rules used in the reinforcement learning literature (e.g., <ref> [11] </ref>), and the fact that we have a multi-agent system where agents behave based on local feedback has some similarity with work on learning automata [22].

Reference-contexts: Much recent work in economics is devoted to investigating more realistic models. One important strand of recent work in economics, which has been strongly inspired by models of population genetics (e.g., <ref> [12, 9] </ref>), tends to relax not only the assumption that the game is common knowledge, but sometimes even that the game is known at all. <p> One important model is that of stochastic games and the notion of evolutionary stable strategies (ess's), where it is shown that under certain conditions the iterated process will converge to a Nash equilibrium. Kandori et al. <ref> [12] </ref> show that by gathering detailed statistics about the relative success of different strategies in a symmetric game that is played stochastically, and adopting a rule which says the society moves in the direction of the more successful strategies, subject to certain mutations, the system converges to Nash equilibrium. <p> In [13], Kan-dori and Rob extend some of the results of <ref> [12] </ref>; they use the best response update rule, where a player selects the strategy that is the best strategy assuming other agents keep using their strategies (which are assumed to be learned by stochastic interactions).

Reference-contexts: Statistical mechanics models are a powerful tool for explaining a variety of phenomena in physics. An important family of models in that area goes 30 under the general name of the Ising model <ref> [14] </ref>. In a typical Ising model we have a set of spins, each of which can be in -1/1 state, and which are organized into some fixed spatial arrangement (such as a one-dimensional sequence or a two-dimensional grid).

Reference-contexts: The best response update rule is also adopted in the work of Gilboa and Matsui [9], as well as in additional related work <ref> [15] </ref>. The main feature of the above-mentioned work is characterized by the fact it uses a model of global interactions where any agent interacts stochastically with all other agents, until gathering almost full information either on the strategies adopted by other agents or on the success of various strategies. <p> This is quite different from models of local interactions where the 11 agents are assumed to interact only with certain neighbors and to update their behavior in a more frequent manner. A detailed discussion on global and local models of interactions appear in <ref> [15] </ref>. We will return to this point later in the end of section 3.1, when we discuss a novel aspect of the model we use. In the above discussion we mentioned some results on the emergence of Nash equilibria. <p> We would like to re-emphasize some of the major differences between our study and the related work in mathematical economics. The model we use is a model of global interaction <ref> [15] </ref> which has been borrowed from the related literature, but our adaptation process is local 17 ; the agent is not assumed to update its behavior after some period of interactions in which it is assumed to gather statistics about the other agents, but to obey a local adaptation rule where <p> As a result, we get a combined framework where local update rules are used to update an agent behavior in a model of global interaction. Since both the local updates ([28],[11],[22]) and the model of global interactions (see <ref> [15] </ref> for a survey) are taken to be of major importance to the corresponding communities, we believe that the introduction of our framework may lead to additional and fruitful cross-fertilization.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, the first game describes a situation in which the goal is to reach homogeneity in the society; it is an instance of the class of coordination games as defined by Lewis in his study of conventions <ref> [18] </ref>. Example 1: [a coordination game]: M = 1; 1 1; 1 ! The second game we will consider is an instance of the well known prisoners dilemma setting, of the sort studied, for example, by Axelrod [2]. This game is a basic game in the study of cooperation. <p> This is due to the full symmetry we have here. For example, the example we presented in Section 3 will still be valid in this case, as well as many other examples in the study of coordination <ref> [18] </ref>. In the sequel we will therefore assume a restriction only to quasi-local update rules, where the agents can observe the behavior of agents they encounter. We would like to mention that by allowing quasi-local update rules, some of the power of our setting is lost.

Some of these rules are designed and agreed upon ahead of time (traffic laws are an example); in previous work <ref> [21, 25] </ref> we investigated some aspects of this off-line design of social laws. However, not all rules can be agreed upon in advance. This is either because the characteristics of the society are unknown, or because they change over time.

Reference-contexts: The way the agents update their behavior in our setting, has some similarity with learning rules used in the reinforcement learning literature (e.g., [11]), and the fact that we have a multi-agent system where agents behave based on local feedback has some similarity with work on learning automata <ref> [22] </ref>. Nevertheless, as we mentioned, our work borrows a framework of agent interaction which is common in the recent mathematical economics literature inspired by theoretical biology. This makes our study much different from existing studies in reinforcement learning.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, even if one wished to do away with an objective notion of zero, one could perhaps synthesize one dynamically based (for example) on average payoffs encountered so far (related ideas appear, for example, in <ref> [23] </ref>). However, this discussion is beyond the scope of our paper. 12 Proofs appear in the Appendix. 16 The above theorem shows that stable conventions can emerge using the a purely local update rule. In addition, it discusses also the evolution of stable conventions which are not Nash-Equilibria.

Reference-contexts: We will return to this topic when we compare our setting to dynamic system models in other fields, and, in particular, economics. 14 3.2 The Highest Cumulative Reward rule We are now ready to start investigating useful action-selection rules. In <ref> [24] </ref> we reported on preliminary results of experiments with a number of such rules. Here we will concentrate on one particular local update rule, called Highest Cumulative Reward. There are a few reasons we concentrate on this rule. First, it is a very natural one. <p> Indeed, we have experimented with such rules as well. However, the results obtained, both analytic and experimental, were not qualitatively different from those obtained for HCR, and hence we stick with the simpler rule. A more detailed discussion of other update rules can be found in <ref> [24] </ref>. <p> However, since our work is concerned with the emergence of such cooperative solutions, it becomes more 18 Some of the results in <ref> [24] </ref> are concerned with a limited form of such extension. 33 related to the above-mentioned work on complex dynamic systems. 6 Summary We used the framework of stochastic social games in order to investigate the emergence of rational social conventions and the efficiency of that process.

Reference-contexts: A plausible a priori intuition about the effect of delaying the application of the update function might be as follows. If one does not delay at all, 14 The efficiency of cooperation evolution is discussed further in <ref> [26] </ref>. 15 By `update' we mean the application of the update function; the result need not be a change in action. 19 agents may react on the basis of insufficient information, leading to a lot of thrashing in the system.

Reference-contexts: We borrow from the economics literature the model for stochastic interactions among agents, which is a most popular and dominant model for agent interactions. On the other hand we borrow ideas of reinforcement learning <ref> [28] </ref> from the AI literature in order to capture the fact that agents use local update rules to update their strategies. As a result, we get a combined framework where local update rules are used to update an agent behavior in a model of global interaction.

Reference-contexts: We definitely acknowledge that it is often useful to single out certain agents (such as Head Robot), and have them be treated in a special manner. We are very interested in the role of agents with special identities (and in particular in the role of organization structure <ref> [29] </ref>), but even with those it is still the case in a rich setting most of the agents will not be distinguishable in this fashion. In this article we investigate the emergence of successful joint actions only in such `faceless masses,' and completely ignore the role of personal identities.
