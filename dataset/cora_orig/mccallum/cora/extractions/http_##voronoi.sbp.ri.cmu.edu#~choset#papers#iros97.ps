Title: Mobile Robot Navigation: Implementing the GVG in the Presence of Sharp Corners  
Author: Ilhan Konukseven** and Howie Choset* 
Abstract: A robot can explore an unknown environment by incrementally constructing a roadmap of that environment using line of sight sensor information. Recall that a roadmap is a one-dimensional representation of a robot's environment. This paper addresses one problem that occurs while generating a roadmap: what happens when sonar sensors cannot detect sharp objects because of the specularities? To do this, a new sensor model is combined with an already existing incremental construction procedure for a roadmap. Experiments on a mobile robot validate the results of this paper.

Reference-contexts: Another heuristic approach involves discretizing a planar world into pixels of some resolution. Typically, this approach handles errors in sonar sensing readings quite well by assigning each pixel a value indicating the likelihood that it overlaps an obstacle <ref> [1] </ref>. Strong experimental results indicate the utility of these approaches, and thus these algorithms may provide a future basis for complete sensor based planners. Unfortunately, these approaches neither afford proofs of correctness that guarantee a path can be found, nor offer well established thresholds for when these heuristic algorithms fail.

Reference-contexts: There are many non-heuristic algorithms for which provably correct solutions exist in the plane (see [9] for an overview). Our approach is to adapt the structure of a provably correct classical motion planning scheme to a sensor based implementation. One such approach is based on a roadmap <ref> [3] </ref>, a one-dimensional subset of a robot's free space which captures all of its important topological properties. A roadmap has the following properties: accessibility, connectivity, and departability.

Reference-contexts: This work uses a sensor based planning approach that relies on a roadmap, a representation which captures all of the salient geometric features found in a robot's free space. Once a robot constructs a roadmap, it has in effect, explored an environment. Previous work <ref> [5] </ref> includes the prescription of an incremental construction procedure for a particular class of roadmaps. This procedure requires only line of sight information, which is an upper bound to what sensors provide, and is thus amenable to sensor based implementation. <p> However, the method in [8] requires full knowledge of the world's geometry prior to the planning event. In [10], an incremental approach to create a Voronoi Diagram-like structure, which is limited to the case of a plane, was introduced. The GVG's incremental construction procedure <ref> [5] </ref> gives the GVG its primary strength. This incremental construction procedure only requires line of sight information and this procedure places no restrictions on the type of obstacles; obstacles need not be polygonal, polyhedral, nor convex, which are assumptions most motion planners require. <p> The paper deals with that situation (note the sharp corner problem for GVG edge tracing was first pointed out in [6]. 3 Related Work The work presented in this paper is based on the GVG, which is described in [4], <ref> [5] </ref>, [6]. <p> Note that G comprises the distance function and thus the GVG can be generated from sensor data.

Reference-contexts: For some environments, this algorithm has been successfully implemented on a mobile robot with a ring of sonar sensors <ref> [6] </ref>. Unfortunately, the incremental construction procedure does not take into consideration the properties of the sonar sensors such as specularities, sensor range, and quantization. For example, sonar sensors are not good at detecting sharp corners that may appear in typical environments. <p> For example, sonar sensors are not good at detecting sharp corners that may appear in typical environments. A sharp corner is "invisible" to the sensor that is facing it.

The sensor measurement axis is a function of the robot's position and orientation (See Fig. 4). Local minima of the distance readings correspond to distance to the nearby obstacles. <ref> [6] </ref>. Recall that a meet point F 123 the robot terminates the edge tracing procedure of a GVG edge F 12 , and begins tracing edge F 13 . In order to do this, the robot first must determine when it encounters a meet point. <p> See Figs. 9 and 10. Note that the naive sensor model would consider C 3 to be visible. 6 Sharp Corners Note that the problem of "false" meet points was first pointed out in <ref> [6] </ref>. In that paper, the authors felt that there was a problem with the meet point detection scheme. In actuality, the problem lies with the sensor model. Now, we introduce a new sensor model and enumerate all the conditions in which a sharp object can cause problems.

Reference-contexts: More specifically, tracability implies that using only local data, the robot can: (1) "trace" the GVG edges; (2) determine when to terminate the edge tracing process, and (3) determine when to start new edge tracing procedures. The GVG incremental approach to edge construction borrows ideas from numerical continuation methods <ref> [7] </ref>. Continuation methods trace the roots of the expression G (y; ) = 0 as the parameter is varied.

Reference-contexts: Roadmaps are also concise in that they do not require that the entire environment be discretized into a fine resolution of pixels. The roadmap, used in this work, can trace its roots to the generalized Voronoi diagram (GVD) in the plane (i.e., when m = 2). O'Dunlaing and Yap <ref> [8] </ref> first applied the GVD, which is the locus of points equidistant to two or more obstacles, to motion planning for a disk in the plane. However, the method in [8] requires full knowledge of the world's geometry prior to the planning event. <p> O'Dunlaing and Yap <ref> [8] </ref> first applied the GVD, which is the locus of points equidistant to two or more obstacles, to motion planning for a disk in the plane.
