Abstract: The Swendsen-Wang process provides one possible dynamics for the Q-state Potts model in statistical physics. Computer simulations of this process are widely used to estimate the expectations of various observ-ables (random variables) of a Potts system in the equilibrium (or Gibbs) distribution. The legitimacy of such simulations depends on the rate of convergence of the process to equilibrium, often known as the mixing rate. Empirical observations suggest that the Swendsen-Wang process mixes rapidly in many instances of practical interest. In spite of this, we show that there are occasions on which the Swendsen-Wang process requires expo nential time (in the size of the system) to approach equilibrium.

Reference-contexts: B. Potts [19] in 1952, has been a focus of much attention in the physics and mathematics communities ever since. Rather than present a detailed historical account of the model here, we refer the interested reader to Baxter <ref> [2, Chap. 12] </ref>. The problem is easily stated. Consider a collection of sites f1; 2; : : : ; ng, denoted by [n], each pair i; j of which has an associated interaction energy, which, for simplicity, we assume takes on one of just two values, either 0 or J. <p> The search for efficient computational solutions to these problems has proved extremely hard and has generated a vast body of literature. (The reader is referred to Chapter 12 of Baxter <ref> [2] </ref>, where some special cases have been considered.) A huge amount of computational effort has also been poured into numerical solutions, especially for regular lattices. Although this problem arises in statistical physics, it has a very interesting connection with theoretical computer science.

Reference-contexts: A well-known result in the theory of random graphs <ref> [3] </ref> tells us that with very high probability, the spin class will break up into very small components (of size O (log -)) so that at the end of Step (2), after assigning random spin values to these very small components, with high probability, we again end up with all spin <p> We can now appeal to results about "the giant component" in random graphs <ref> [3] </ref> to say that with high probability, at the end of Step (1) there would be one large component and all the other components would be very small.

(See, for example, Edwards and Sokal <ref> [6] </ref>.) This Markov chain seems to work very well in practice, however, it has not been proved to be rapidly mixing for any class of graphs.

Reference-contexts: In fact, by tuning the coupling constant, we arrange that the two kinds of configurations make a roughly equal contribution to Z. Such a system is said to be in a mixed phase and the two kinds of configurations are called coexisting phases <ref> [7] </ref>. This value of the coupling constant is usually referred to as its critical value (denoted here by K cr ). The phase transition reflects a crucial instability in the model in the following sense.

We have the interaction graph G = ([n]; E) just as before, however, there are no spins on the sites.

Reference-contexts: A number of different dynamics are possible. The simplest is to move between configurations by changing one spin at a time, with transition probabilities determined by the "Metropolis rule" <ref> [17] </ref>. <p> The acceptance condition used here is called the Metropolis rule, which is familiar in the computer simulation of models in statistical physics <ref> [17] </ref>. Unfortunately, the Markov chain described above has not been proved to be rapidly mixing. In fact, when Q = 2, i.e., when we have an Ising system, it can be shown that the chain is not rapidly mixing in the ferromagnetic case, when K is sufficiently large.

Reference-contexts: It is fairly easy to demonstrate situations in which this random walk takes exponential time (in n, the size of the graph) to approach equilibrium, even in the ferromagnetic case. 1 A more complicated dynamics, which allows many spins to change in one step, was proposed by Swendsen and Wang <ref> [22] </ref> and is now widely used in computer simulations. The Swendsen-Wang process (as we shall call it) appears to converge rapidly to equilibrium in many instances of practical interest.

Reference-contexts: The Potts model also turns out to be one of the many specialisations of the famous Tutte polynomial in graph theory. The reader is referred to Welsh <ref> [23, p. 62] </ref> for more on this interesting connection. A lot of research effort has been devoted to finding efficient approximation algorithms for #P-complete problems, where by efficient we mean that the algorithm is guaranteed to run in time polynomial in the number of sites n. <p> The antiferromagnetic case seems to be even harder: in fact, for the Ising model, Jerrum and Sinclair [9] (following Barahona [1]) proved that the existence of even an fpras is highly unlikely. Similar results for the Potts model have been proved by Welsh <ref> [23, p. 138] </ref>. However, it is worth mentioning that if Q 2, where is the maximum degree of a vertex in the interaction graph G, then the Markov chain described above can be shown to be rapidly mixing and yields an fpras.
