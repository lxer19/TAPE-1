Title: Extending WWW for Synchronous  
Author: Collaboration 
Affiliation: SRI International  
Abstract: The WorldWide Web (WWW), in conjunction with such tools as Mosaic, is an extremely effective mechanism for individuals to share distributed information. However, access to this information is unidirectional, asynchronous, and limited by a client/server model in which only predefined data are provided. We describe augmenting WWW to support bidirectional, synchronous collaboration between data producers and their consumers. This is accomplished by exploiting WWWs ease of access and use, and by incorporating a peer-to-peer model that provides real-time collaboration services.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION The WorldWide Web (WWW) <ref> [BERN] </ref>, in conjunction with such tools as Mosaic, is an extremely effective mechanism for individuals to share distributed information. In effect, WW W and its associated viewers constitute a onestop shopping center for static text, images, audio, virtual documents, etc. in a virtual and international market.

Reference-contexts: It ensures that input to single-user applications is generated by one user at a time. This is accomplished by an activity sensing contention resolution algorithm (i.e., floor control) that permits users to share applications in an informal and conversational manner <ref> [GARC] </ref>. Recalling the usage scenario described above, Figure 2 shows that the browsers Mosaic window, running through XCPS, is also seen on the authors screen, providing her with context from the browsers workspace.
