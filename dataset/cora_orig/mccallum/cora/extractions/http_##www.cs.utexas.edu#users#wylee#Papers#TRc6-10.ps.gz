Title: Chapter 6 Causal Level 6.1 Introduction ontology of the SSH causal level. A more complete
Note: The next section describes the  99  
Abstract: The SSH causal level abstracts continuous behavior (described at the control level) to a discrete graph of experiential states (views) and causal links (actions). When a sequence of control strategies reliably takes an SSH robot from one d-state to another, the sensory images at the initial and final d-states are abstracted to views, V and V 0 respectively, and the sequence of control strategies to an action, A. A schema, hV; A; V 0 i, is used to represent the association of the views to the action. Views and actions at the causal level serve as discrete representations of experience, providing an abstraction of the continuous world at the control level to the discrete sensorimotor world at the causal level. A view is a sensory image obtained at a distinctive state. It could be a complete snapshot of the sensory input vector s(t) (see Section 3.4.1), or a partial description consistent with a history of s(t), h s (t). Different d-states may have the same view. An action represents a sequence of one or more control strategies which moves an SSH robot from one d-state to another. The sequence typically begins with a trajectory-following control strategy and ends with a hill-climbing control strategy.

Reference-contexts: There are advantages and disadvantages to using a sonar feature based representation as compared to using an iconic representation like an occupancy grid. These aspects have been widely discussed in a related publications <ref> [Thrun and Bucken, 1996; Brooks, 1985; Leonard and Durrant-Whyte, 1992] </ref>. A relatively accurate local geometry of a place neighborhood can be used for localization of a robot. Leonard and Durrant-Whyte [1992], MacKenzie and Dudek 122 [1994], and Crowley [1985] use local sonar features based map for localization.

Reference-contexts: When uncertainties in modeling are used, Kalman filter based data assimilation or fusion can be applied <ref> [Smith and Cheeseman, 1986, Leonard and Durrant-Whyte, 1992; Recken, 1994] </ref>. For example, consider a point p 1 representing a convex corner with an associated position uncertainty represented as a covariance matrix fl 1 , and a second point p 2 with covariance matrix fl 2 . <p> Some of them are straightforward, others are not. Currently, Spot does not reason much with uncertainty in sensory data. If uncertainties in sensing and in motion are modeled, they can be used within a Kalman filter framework <ref> [Smith and Cheeseman, 1986, Leonard and Durrant-Whyte, 1992; Recken, 1994] </ref> or other frameworks in data assimilation and fusion. An example has been given in Section 6.4.4. Presently, Spot handles only junctions found on a typical indoor office floor.
