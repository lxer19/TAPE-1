Reference-contexts: The size of the approximation can be gauged by looking at the following asymptotic expansion <ref> [1] </ref>: ln N ! ~ N ln N N + 1 2 ln 2 + 12N 1 For any given number of terms, this expansion is better for large N , but for small N , more terms are significant and should be included. <p> To do this to the required accuracy, we will keep one more factor in Stirling's approximation than is customary for small 169 numbers <ref> [1] </ref>: ln N ! ~ = &gt; &lt; N ln N N + 1 N ln N N ; N N: Suppose for a moment that we can ignore the constraints imposed by the conservation laws.

Reference-contexts: In order for adjacent monomers in a CA simulation to overlap, there must be extra space in a cell for a second monomer to occupy. The simplest way to do this is to invoke a double space <ref> [2, 79, 80] </ref> and have odd and even monomers alternate between spaces along the chain as shown in figure 5-5. Connectivity is again determined solely by adjacency in any direction, but only between monomers in opposite spaces.

Reference-contexts: However, since the dynamics is reversible, the entropy of the system tends to increase. Adding surface tension to maintain the integrity of the object would make the rule irreversible. Such considerations illustrate the difficulty of making a reversible dynamics stable <ref> [3, 92] </ref>. The second problem is the lower limit on the size of a disturbance in a discrete 151 system. For example, in a discrete space, one can't even imagine the smooth, con-tinuous acceleration usually associated with F = ma. Another argument goes as follows.

Reference-contexts: The result is a number of stable structures, oscillating "blinkers," propagating "gliders," and still other areas churning with activity. It has been shown that this rule is already sufficiently complex to simulate any digital computation <ref> [4] </ref>. voting. Pattern (a) is the result of a simulation where each cell votes to go along with a simple majority (5 out of 9) of its neighbors. Starting from the standard random configuration and running for 35 steps gives a stable pattern of voters.

Reference-contexts: The presentation is meant to be intuitive and readily absorbed, so no great attempt is made to be rigorous. Instead, the terms are used rather loosely, and many logical shortcuts are taken. The reader who requires more detail can consult any number of references <ref> [7, 16, 96] </ref>. The first section covers those aspects of geometry that do not require any notion of distance|in particular, manifolds and tensor fields. In section D.1.2, further geometric structure is added by introducing a metric tensor. Finally, the special-case definitions used in chapter 4 are given in section D.1.3.

Reference-contexts: In principle, this leads to a large amount of communication between the processors during the calculation of the interactions because any two monomers in the system may come into contact <ref> [8] </ref>. If this is not enough of a problem, it also happens that communication and synchronization between processors is usually a time-consuming operation [67]. Because of these considerations, it has generally been considered difficult to perform efficient parallel processing simulations of polymers.

Reference-contexts: The successful (and profound) aim of this research was to show that certain essential features of biology can be captured in computational form. Much of von Neumann's work was completed and extended by Burks <ref> [9] </ref>. This line of CA research was followed through the 60's by related studies on construction, adaptation, and optimization as well as by investigations on the purely mathematical properties of CA.

Reference-contexts: The hardware consists of about one hundred ordinary integrated circuits and fits into a single slot of an IBM-PC compatible personal computer [83]. The machine is controlled and programmed in the FORTH language which runs on the PC <ref> [10] </ref>. For the range of computations for which CAM-6 is best suited, it is possible to obtain supercomputer performance for roughly 1/10000th the cost. The circuitry of any computer (including cellular automata machines) can be divided into two categories: data and control.

Reference-contexts: While this is not physically realistic, it will not matter to the correct scaling behavior as long as some measure of excluded volume is still maintained. Others have recognized various forms of rigidity in lattice polymers and have proposed several algorithms to get around the problems <ref> [11, 26] </ref>. In order for adjacent monomers in a CA simulation to overlap, there must be extra space in a cell for a second monomer to occupy. <p> The advantages of the double space algorithm can be gauged by comparing it with the bond fluctuation method, a state-of-the-art Monte-Carlo algorithm <ref> [11] </ref>. There are basically four ways in which the double space algorithm excels: (1) step speed (less computer time per time step), (2) relaxation rate (fewer steps per relaxation time), (3) inherent parallelism, and (4) simplicity. Each of these point along with possible drawbacks will be considered briefly below.

Reference-contexts: However, even for low density systems, an advantage in doing them on cellular automata machines is that real-time visualization is immediately possible. These examples bring up several problems for future research. An important application of polymer simulation is to polymer melts <ref> [12, 51] </ref>. An ongoing project is to study two-dimensional abstract polymer melts such as the one shown in figure 5-14. Preliminary measurements consisting of histograms, averages, and relaxation times have been made on over a dozen quantities including radii, bond lengths, and Monte Carlo acceptance ratios.

Reference-contexts: In fact, investigations of polymer collapse were originally motivated with a view towards the protein folding problem. While real proteins are very complex objects and local structure counts for almost everything, there are still some interesting things that can be done with simulations on lattice proteins <ref> [13] </ref>. Furthermore, it is still possible to model highly complex interactions with 133 CA (including solvents) by introducing intermolecular potentials and using spatial partitioning.

Reference-contexts: The question also illustrates the problem with coming up with fundamental dynamics of physical interest.

Unfortunately, one-dimensional problems often have special properties which make them uniquely tractable [54]. <p> Perhaps correlated information can be less than a bit, but this seems too abstract to comprise a real solid object. It may be the case that any CA which has material transport always amounts to a lattice gas. The final problem is particular to Chopard's "strings" model <ref> [14, 15] </ref>, but it may be a reflection of deeper underlying problems. This model is quite simple and elegant, and it has several of the desired features.

Finally, the special-case definitions used in chapter 4 are given in section D.1.3. <p> Group The set of smooth mappings of a spacetime to itself that result in a rescaling of the metric is called the conformal group, and it also happens to be the group that preserves the causal structure defined by the light cones (i.e., it maps null vectors to 3 See <ref> [16] </ref> for definitions of the operators d, ^, and ffi. 206 null vectors). The picture of mapping the space to itself is the active point of view, but the conformal group can also be viewed as a change of coordinates, which is the passive point of view. <p> Thus, we would like our CA fields to follow a true geometry and not have them be a mere, discretized approximation of components in some special basis. The ultimate goal in this direction is to pattern the analysis after a geometrical approach to physics <ref> [16] </ref>. Topology is also an important consideration in representing physical spaces and fields. The main properties from topology that we are concerned with are connected 221 ness and continuity.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, by using the Laplace transform, the initial boundary values can be absorbed into the transformed equations. Accordingly, the Laplace transform is defined by ~ f (s) Lff (z)g 0 where table D.1 gives a complete list of the transforms that are needed in this section <ref> [17] </ref>. The equations are transformed term by term, and each term can be transformed one variable at a time.

Reference-contexts: After 1000 steps, the clustering of cell values is well underway, and after 10000 steps, even larger domains have developed. The domains typically grow according to power laws, ~ ~ t ff=2 where ff 1, and in an infinite space, they would eventually become distributed over all size scales <ref> [18] </ref>. This rule has also been suggested as a model of genetic drift, where each cell represents an individual, and the value in the cell represents one of four possible genotypes [50]. 31 (a) (b) simple majority voting quickly leads to stable voting blocks (a).

Reference-contexts: Usually the recurrence time is astronomical because there are so many variables and few conservation laws, but for the specific system shown in figure 2-10, the period is a mere 40926 steps. Cellular automata are well-suited for doing dynamical simulations of Ising models <ref> [19, 20, 93] </ref>, where each cell contains one spin (1 = up, 1 = down). <p> The tokens are sometimes called demons following Creutz, who originated the general idea of introducing additional degrees of freedom to enable microcanonical Monte Carlo simulation <ref> [19, 20] </ref>. The particles and the energy tokens move from cell to cell under an appropriate CA rule as described below. <p> T 1 would probably give the best single measure because it only depends on R 1 which is large and will have the smallest relative error (~ 1= p R 1 ). Alternative methods for extracting the temperature are suggested elsewhere <ref> [19, 20, 73] </ref>. Note in the formulas above that a population inversion in the N i ,s or the R j 's will lead to a negative value for T . This can happen in any system which has an upper bound on the amount of energy it can hold.

Similar baths of demons have been used in a number of variants of dynamical Ising models <ref> [20, 73] </ref>, and further generalization is straightforward. A.1 Probabilities and Statistics For purposes of analysis, it is convenient to view the heat bath as completely isolated and having a fixed energy while its dynamics redistributes the energy among its internal degrees of freedom. <p> In other applications, the extra degrees of freedom help speed the evolution of system by making the dynamics more flexible <ref> [20, 89] </ref>. In both of these cases, the subsystems interact and affect each other in a cooperative fashion so as to remember the past of the coupled system. <p> T 1 would probably give the best single measure because it only depends on R 1 which is large and will have the smallest relative error (~ 1= p R 1 ).

Reference-contexts: However, the phenomena are often so complex that computational methods are becoming increasingly necessary to the research. From a more theoretical and mathematical point of view, polymers provide interesting phases of matter and a rich set of phenomena which are often well described by scaling laws <ref> [21] </ref>. A scaling law is a relation of the form y ~ x ff . It says that over a certain range, multiplying (or scaling) x by a constant g has the effect of multiplying y by a related constant g ff . <p> Now consider an isolated polymer in a good solvent with short-range, repulsive interactions between monomers. In the limit of high polymerization, the details of the local polymer structure don't effect the large-scale structure <ref> [21] </ref>, and the polymer effectively becomes a continuous, self-avoiding strand as shown in figure 5-1. Thus it is possible to approximate this situation with an abstract polymer model consisting of a chain of nonoverlapping monomers, where all configurations have equal energies. <p> CA rules for abstract molecular simulation, and useful techniques for incorporating randomness in CA are discussed in appendices A and C. 5.4.1 Polymer Melts, Solutions, and Gels This section and the next describe some of the variations on the double space algorithm that have just begun to be explored (see <ref> [21] </ref> for ideas). The models are still athermal, meaning that there is no temperature parameter which can be adjusted, but they show how much can already be done with such trivial energetics. <p> It follows in the spirit of the highly physical arguments given by deGennes <ref> [21] </ref>. While there has been a great deal of sophisticated work done on polymer statistics including field-theoretic and renormalization group calculations, no great effort is made here to be physically or mathematically rigorous.

Other spatial domain decomposition schemes can be used for a wide range of simulations <ref> [30] </ref>. To see how partitioning can be used, consider the abstract polymer shown in figure 5-2. Each monomer is represented by an excluded volume disk of radius r, and the bond between monomers are indicated by line segments. Each square represents a region of space assigned to a processor.

The notion of entropy used here is discussed next and is consistent with Jaynes' Principle of Maximum Entropy <ref> [45] </ref>. The entropy so defined will prove useful for calculating the average number of particles in the various regions of the space. A measure of entropy can only properly be applied to an ensemble, or probability distribution over states, rather than to a single configuration. <p> If this is the case, one may say 72 that ergodicity is broken because the time average is not the same as a standard ensemble average. However, the nature of the deviation provides a hint for finding new integrals of the motion <ref> [45] </ref>. Therefore, when faced with such a discrepancy, one should consider the possibility of hidden conservation laws.

Reference-contexts: Another interesting possibility would be to use a time dependent contour map as a potential, especially if the potential could be made to depend on 87 the gas. CA rules that generate such contour maps have been used to model the time evolution of asynchronous computation <ref> [58] </ref>. 3.7 Conclusions Microscopic reversibility is a characteristic feature of fundamental physical laws and is an important ingredient of CA rules which are intended to model fundamental physics. <p> This inherent limit of CA is often referred to as the speed of light, and it imposes a causal structure much like that found in physics. In any event, such a speed limit is suggestive, and it has led to speculation on the role of relativity in CA <ref> [58, 84] </ref>. The existence of a maximum speed in CA is completely automatic and corresponds to the secondary postulate of relativity, but the more important and more difficult task is to find ways to implement the primary postulate.

Reference-contexts: Different types of monomers and solvent molecules (which can be denoted by extra bits in a CA) may attract each other to varying degrees, and this can result in gelation, folding, or further polymerization. Equilibrium ensembles of polymer mixtures having well-defined energies can be sampled using the Metropolis algorithm <ref> [62] </ref> as follows. Trial moves are generated as before, but instead of checking for violation of absolute constraints, the moves are accepted or rejected probabilistically. <p> Any of the four probabilities of attaining a particular energy can then be used as an acceptance ratio in a more conventional Monte Carlo algorithm <ref> [62] </ref>. The cells will be independent 161 from each other at any given time if they were in maximum entropy configuration initially (since any correlations would reduce the entropy while it must increase or stay the same [87]). <p> However, in many physical situations, one may want one branch to be more probable than the other.

These simulations suggest that polymers preferentially collapse from the ends instead of uniformly along their length in a hierarchical fashion as is the case for chains near the so-called fi point (where steric repulsion and van der Waals attraction between monomers cancel).

Examples of such dynamical behavior can be found in disciplines ranging from geology and meteorology to chemistry and biology [97].

Reference-contexts: This makes for a greater heat capacity as well as a richer set of statistics. Similar baths of demons have been used in a number of variants of dynamical Ising models <ref> [20, 73] </ref>, and further generalization is straightforward. A.1 Probabilities and Statistics For purposes of analysis, it is convenient to view the heat bath as completely isolated and having a fixed energy while its dynamics redistributes the energy among its internal degrees of freedom. <p> T 1 would probably give the best single measure because it only depends on R 1 which is large and will have the smallest relative error (~ 1= p R 1 ). Alternative methods for extracting the temperature are suggested elsewhere <ref> [19, 20, 73] </ref>. Note in the formulas above that a population inversion in the N i ,s or the R j 's will lead to a negative value for T . This can happen in any system which has an upper bound on the amount of energy it can hold.

Reference-contexts: In order for adjacent monomers in a CA simulation to overlap, there must be extra space in a cell for a second monomer to occupy. The simplest way to do this is to invoke a double space <ref> [2, 79, 80] </ref> and have odd and even monomers alternate between spaces along the chain as shown in figure 5-5. Connectivity is again determined solely by adjacency in any direction, but only between monomers in opposite spaces.

Thus, we would like our CA fields to follow a true geometry and not have them be a mere, discretized approximation of components in some special basis. The ultimate goal in this direction is to pattern the analysis after a geometrical approach to physics [16].

Reference-contexts: The next wave of CA research|and the most relevant one for purposes of this thesis|was the application of CA to physics, and in particular, showing how essential features of physics can be captured in computational form. Interest in this subject was spawned largely by Tommaso Toffoli <ref> [84] </ref> and Edward Fredkin. Steven Wolfram was responsible for capturing the wider interest of the physics community with a series of papers in the 80's [99], while others were applying CA to a variety of problems in other fields [27, 38]. <p> This inherent limit of CA is often referred to as the speed of light, and it imposes a causal structure much like that found in physics. In any event, such a speed limit is suggestive, and it has led to speculation on the role of relativity in CA <ref> [58, 84] </ref>. The existence of a maximum speed in CA is completely automatic and corresponds to the secondary postulate of relativity, but the more important and more difficult task is to find ways to implement the primary postulate.

Reference-contexts: This means that one counts the number of "particles" in a region and takes the mean (averaged on a per area basis). Toffoli <ref> [85] </ref> gives a general discussion of how to do this along with other ways in which CA might be viewed as an alternative mathematical structure for physics.

Reference-contexts: An important technological development during this time was the introduction of special hardware in the form of cellular automata machines <ref> [89] </ref> and massively parallel computers. These investigations set the stage for the development of lattice gases [32, 55], which have become a separate area of research in themselves [24, 25]. <p> Each rule will only be described to the extent needed for understanding the basic ideas and significant features of the model. Most of the examples are discussed in greater depth in reference <ref> [89] </ref>. The examples have been grouped into seven modeling categories which cover a range of applications, and each section illustrates a definite dynamical theme. Perhaps a more rigorous way to classify CA rules is by what type of neighborhood they use and whether they are reversible or irreversible. <p> The even time steps can be thought of as ancillary steps wherein bookkeeping functions are performed. During these steps, the gas particles are held stationary while the heat particles are deterministically and reversibly stirred with the "TM" lattice gas rule <ref> [89] </ref> as shown in figure 3-5 (left). In the TM rule, particles move horizontally and vertically unless they have an isolated collision with a certain impact parameter, in which case they stop and turn 90 ffi . This constitutes a reversible, particle conserving, momentum conserving, nonlinear lattice gas dynamics. <p> In regions of constant potential, the gas particles follow the "HPP" lattice gas rule <ref> [89] </ref> as shown in figure 3-5 (right). A summary of this rule is that particles move diagonally unless they have an isolated, head-on collision, in which case they scatter by 90 ffi . <p> In other applications, the extra degrees of freedom help speed the evolution of system by making the dynamics more flexible <ref> [20, 89] </ref>. In both of these cases, the subsystems interact and affect each other in a cooperative fashion so as to remember the past of the coupled system.

Reference-contexts: We are interested in capturing as many principles of physics in our CA models as possible, and therefore, we strive to construct CA dynamics which are reversible. In other words, the dynamics should map the states of the system in a one-to-one and onto manner <ref> [90] </ref>. In addition, we would like the inverse mapping to also be a local CA rule and to resemble the forward rule as much as possible.

Reference-contexts: Besides conventional homogeneous substances it is also possible to model more exotic heterogeneous materials which are not usually thought of as matter in the physicists' sense of the word: currencies, alluvia, populations, and even "grey matter." These possibilities lead to the notion of "programmable matter" <ref> [91] </ref> which is a powerful metaphor for describing the relationship between CA and the essential information-bearing degrees of freedom of nature.

Reference-contexts: However, since the dynamics is reversible, the entropy of the system tends to increase. Adding surface tension to maintain the integrity of the object would make the rule irreversible. Such considerations illustrate the difficulty of making a reversible dynamics stable <ref> [3, 92] </ref>. The second problem is the lower limit on the size of a disturbance in a discrete 151 system. For example, in a discrete space, one can't even imagine the smooth, con-tinuous acceleration usually associated with F = ma. Another argument goes as follows.

Voting rules are characteristically irreversible because the information in a cell is often erased without contributing to another cell, and irreversibility is equivalent to destroying information. <p> Usually the recurrence time is astronomical because there are so many variables and few conservation laws, but for the specific system shown in figure 2-10, the period is a mere 40926 steps. Cellular automata are well-suited for doing dynamical simulations of Ising models <ref> [19, 20, 93] </ref>, where each cell contains one spin (1 = up, 1 = down).

Reference-contexts: Originally, CA were introduced around 1950 (at the suggestion of Slanislaw Ulam) in order to provide a simple model of self-reproducing automata <ref> [94] </ref>.

Instead, the terms are used rather loosely, and many logical shortcuts are taken. The reader who requires more detail can consult any number of references <ref> [7, 16, 96] </ref>. The first section covers those aspects of geometry that do not require any notion of distance|in particular, manifolds and tensor fields.

Reference-contexts: These investigations set the stage for the development of lattice gases [32, 55], which have become a separate area of research in themselves [24, 25]. In addition to lattice gases, one of the largest areas of current interest in CA involves studies in complexity <ref> [66, 97] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps the most significant advantage of the double-space algorithm from a theoretical point of view is the fact that it is inherently parallel|a full half of the polymers can be updated simultaneously. Whereas great effort is required to vectorize traditional Monte-Carlo polymer simulations <ref> [98] </ref>, formulation of the problem in terms of cellular automata insures that the algorithm is parallelizable from the outset. Hence, the technique marks a conceptual milestone in our thinking about computational 123 polymer physics.
