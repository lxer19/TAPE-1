Abstract: This paper presents a state-space perspective on the kinodynamic planning problem, and introduces a randomized path planning technique that computes collision-free kinodynamic trajectories for high degree-of-freedom problems. By using a state space formulation, the kinodynamic planning problem is treated as a 2n-dimensional nonholonomic planning problem, derived from an n-dimensional configuration space. The state space serves the same role as the configuration space for basic path planning; however, standard randomized path planning techniques do not directly apply to planning trajectories in the state space. We have developed a randomized planning approach that is particularly tailored to kinodynamic problems in state spaces, although it also applies to standard nonholonomic and holonomic planning problems. The basis for this approach is the construction of a tree that attempts to rapidly and uniformly explore the state space, offering benefits that are similar to those obtained by successful randomized planning methods, but applies to a much broader class of problems. Some preliminary results are discussed for an implementation that determines kinodynamic trajectories for hov-ercrafts and satellites in cluttered environments, resulting in state spaces of up to twelve dimensions.

Reference-contexts: For the purpose of discussion, we choose two different techniques that have been successful in recent years: randomized potential fields (e.g, [2, 6]) and randomized roadmaps (e.g., <ref> [1, 15] </ref>). In the randomized potential field approach, a heuristic function is defined on the configuration space that attempts to steer the robot toward the goal through gradient descent. If the search becomes trapped in a local minimum, random walks are used to help escape.

Reference-contexts: The common model in motion planning research has been to decouple the general robotics problem by solving basic path planning, and then finding a trajectory and controller that satisfies the dynamics and follows the path <ref> [3, 16, 24, 25] </ref>. The vast majority of basic path planning algorithms consider only kinematics, while ignoring the system dynamics entirely. Motion planning that takes into account dynamic constraints as well as kinematic constraints is known as kinodynamic planning.

Reference-contexts: This result directly enables the connection of two configurations with the optimal-length path. For more complicated problems, such as kinematic planning for a tractor-trailer, it seems that a reasonable roadmap planner could be developed using steering results <ref> [4, 17, 23, 27] </ref>. These results enable a system to be driven from one configuration to another, and generally apply to driftless systems that are nilpotentizable (a condition on the underlying Lie algebra). In general, however, the connection problem can again be as difficult as designing a nonlinear controller.

Reference-contexts: Although it appears somewhat random, this tree has a very strong bias towards places it has already explored. In general, it is difficult to overcome such biases, which Random Tree. Each tree has 2000 vertices. also motivated the expansive C-space work in <ref> [13] </ref>. To overcome this bias, we propose to construct a Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree as follows. Insert the initial state as a vertex. Repeatedly select a point at random in [0; 100] fi [0; 100], and find the nearest-neighbor, x k , in the tree.

Reference-contexts: For the first complication, approximate nearest neighbor techniques <ref> [14] </ref> can be employed to help improve performance; it is not crucial to have the absolute closest neighbor. The second complication can make it harder to wander through narrow passageways, much like in the case of randomized roadmaps.

Reference-contexts: Planar Body with Rotation (dim X = 6) We extend the previous experiments to consider systems with rotation. First, we consider the case of a rigid object with two unilateral thrusters each producing a torque of opposite sign, such as the one described in <ref> [18] </ref>. Each thruster provides a line of force fixed in the body frame that restricts its motion to a plane. This model is similar to that of a hovercraft, navigating with drift.
