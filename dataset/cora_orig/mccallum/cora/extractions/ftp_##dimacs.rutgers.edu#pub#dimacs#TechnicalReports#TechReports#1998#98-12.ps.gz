Reference-contexts: Algorithmic terminologies not defined here are referred to <ref> [7, 1] </ref>. One observation from cosmid contig mapping is that proper containment between DNA fragments is rare. When one clone is a subfragment of another, often they share one end.

Reference-contexts: The goal of physical mapping is to reconstruct the relative positions of clones along original DNA. There are various techniques to determine if two clones overlap. Most of them involve obtaining fingerprints for clones, and determine that two clones overlap if their fingerprints are sufficiently similar <ref> [2, 3, 6, 12] </ref>. Overlap relation of clones can be represented by an interval graph, where the vertices correspond to clones and two vertices are adjacent if their corresponding clones overlap.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, reliable and complete overlap information is very costly and practically not available. Therefore, map construction could be more efficient if it can be done by using only a subset of overlap information. Different from fingerprinting, cosmid contig mapping generates overlap information by hybridization <ref> [4, 15] </ref>. In this process, a set of clones is placed on a filter for colony hybridization. The filter is probed with clones that have been radioactively labeled at their ends.

Reference-contexts: Interval graphs are well known perfect graphs. A graph is weakly triangulated if both G and G c ; the complement of G; do not have any induced subgraph isomorphic to a chordless cycle of at least five vertices. Hayword <ref> [8] </ref> showed that weakly triangulated graphs are prefect graphs. The following was shown in [11]. Theorem 3.1 [11] Probe interval graphs are weakly triangulated. In the following, we show that, similar to probe interval graphs, tagged probe interval graphs are weakly triangulated graphs.

Reference-contexts: Graphs that can be partitioned into a split graph and an independent set (or a clique) can be viewed as split split graphs, which are studied in <ref> [9] </ref>. In the same spirit, we call a graph G = (V; E) an interval split graph if there is a partition of V = fV 1 ; V 2 g such that G (V 1 ) is an interval graph and G (V 2 ) is an independent set.

Reference-contexts: It is known that intersection graphs of such families are precisely the so-called proper interval graphs. Roberts <ref> [13] </ref> showed that a graph is a proper interval graph if and only if there is a compatible order on its vertex set such that if x y z w and xw 2 E; then yz 2 E: The following heuristic is based on this characterization and Theorem 4.1.
