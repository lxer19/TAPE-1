Abstract: Evaluation of counterfactual queries (e.g., "If A were true, would C have been true?") is important to fault diagnosis, planning, determination of liability, and policy analysis. We present a method for evaluating counter-factuals when the underlying causal model is represented by structural models a nonlinear generalization of the simultaneous equations models commonly used in econometrics and social sciences. This new method provides a coherent means for evaluating policies involving the control of variables which, prior to enacting the policy were influenced by other variables in the system.

Reference-contexts: In particular, this paper concentrates on linear and boolean functions (e.g., Noisy-OR gates). In the case that the model is nonparametric, only bounds may be calculated for the belief of a counterfactual consequent <ref> [Balke and Pearl, 1994a] </ref>. To illustrate the intervention-based interpretation of counterfactuals, consider a firing squad with several riflemen (one called Bob) and a Captain who gives a signal to either shoot or release a prisoner charged with treason.

Reference-contexts: A connection between counterfactuals and policy making was formulated in <ref> [Balke and Pearl, 1994b] </ref> using a simple device from action theory. In that formulation, the counterfactual antecedent is interpreted as a hypothetical minimal intervention that forces the counter-factual antecedent to hold true. <p> A calculus for working with interventions in causal theories is given in [Pearl, 1994]. <ref> [Balke and Pearl, 1994b] </ref> provides background and motivation for the evaluation of counterfactual conditionals and briefly illustrates how the intervention scheme would handle counterfactuals in models represented by linear structural equations. <p> Our method, which suppresses abduction by removing equations from the model, has two advantages. In the probabilistic analysis, our method permits the coun-terfactual computation using ordinary evidence propagation in a dual network <ref> [Balke and Pearl, 1994b] </ref>. Moreover, our proposal is also applicable to nonrecur-sive theories as will be shown in Section 3. 2.2 ASSUMPTION-BASED ANALYSIS In the previous subsection we assumed that there were no exceptions to the normal behaviors of each of the characters in the story.

Reference-contexts: The reduced-form method is valid only when past decisions are nonresponsive to other variables in the system, and this, unfortunately, eliminates most of the interesting control variables (e.g., tax rates, interest rates, quotas) from the analysis. 3 2 This distinction is often blurred in the literature. <ref> [Druzdzel and Simon, 1993] </ref>, for example, state: "A variable is considered exogenous to a system if its value is determined outside the system, either because we can control its value externally (e.g., the amount of taxes in a macro-economic model) or because we believe that this variable is controlled externally (like

Reference-contexts: While every economist knows that this disturbance-independence is a necessary condition for consistent estimation of structural parameters, most economists assume that disturbance-independence is a guaranteed property of controllable policy variables. A popular textbook <ref> [Intriligator, 1978] </ref>, for example, mentions these two properties as if they were synonymous: "The exogenous variables are variables the values for which are determined outside the model but which influence the model.
