Reference-contexts: We can use continuation algorithms (see, for example, Allgower and Georg <ref> [2] </ref>), but these algorithms are designed to trace stationary points of h, that is, solutions to @ x h [x (); ] = 0: Our situation is somewhat different because we need to trace minimizers of h.

Reference-contexts: If the protein structure is determined from bounds on distances between pairs of atoms and other geometric constraints on the protein, then distance geometry <ref> [9, 20] </ref> techniques are required. Both approaches require the solution of global optimization problems. The problem of finding the least energy structure for a given molecular system arises not only in biological studies, but also in the study of large, confined ionic systems in plasma physics [19, 39, 44]. <p> For a general review of the distance geometry problem and its relationship to macromolecular modeling, see Crippen and Havel <ref> [9] </ref>, Havel [20], Kuntz, Thomason, and Oshiro [30], and Brunger and Nilges [4]. A distance geometry problem is specified by a subset S of all atom pairs and by the distances ffi i;j between atoms i and j for (i; j) 2 S. <p> A simple formulation is in terms of finding the global minimum of the function f (x) = i;j2S where the pairwise potential p i;j : IR n 7! IR is defined for problem (2.1) by p i;j (x) = kxk 2 ffi 2 j 2 while Crippen and Havel <ref> [9] </ref> suggested that for problem (2.2) p i;j (x) = min 2 kxk 2 l 2 l 2 ; 0 + max 2 kxk 2 u 2 u 2 ; 0 : (2:6) Clearly, x = fx 1 ; : : :; x m g solves the distance geometry problem if <p> If all pairwise distances are known and a solution exists, then the solution of the distance geometry problem (2.1) can be determined (Blumenthal [3, Section 43], Crippen and Havel <ref> [9, Section 6.3] </ref>) by computing the largest three eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the rank-3 positive semidefinite matrix A 2 IR mfim defined by a i;j = 1 i i + ffi 2 i;j ; i; j = 1; : : :; m; where ffi i = kx i x 0 k, <p> In practice, only a small subset of the distances is known, and there are experimental errors in the data, so the above procedure cannot be used. However, an extension of this procedure is employed by the embed algorithm (see Crippen and Havel <ref> [9] </ref>, and Havel [20]) in practical distance geometry calculations. <p> The formulation of the distance geometry problem (2.2) in terms of p i;j (x) = h i;j (kxk) where h i;j is defined by (4.4) is typical, but other formulations have been used. Crippen and Havel <ref> [9] </ref> used h i;j (r) = min 2 r 2 l 2 r 2 ; 0 + max 2 r 2 u 2 u 2 ; 0 ; because they felt that this formulation lead to a problem with fewer minimizers, but Havel [20] advocates the use of h i;j (r)

Reference-contexts: The distance geometry problem (2.1) is computationally intractable because the restriction of the distance geometry problem to a one-dimensional space is equivalent to the set partition problem, which is known to be NP-complete <ref> [10] </ref>. Saxe [42] shows that k-dimensional distance geometry problems are strongly NP-hard for all k 1. The following result of More and Wu [34] shows that obtaining an approximate solution to the distance geometry problem is also NP-hard.

Reference-contexts: The weights and nodes can be found in the tables of Stroud and Secrest [50] or computed with the gauss subroutine in ORTHOPOL <ref> [11] </ref> if the function h is even. For general h we should use a Gaussian quadrature for the semi-infinite interval [0; +1), as advocated by Steen, Byrne, and Gelbard [49]. The Gauss-Hermite transform (3.7) can be viewed as a discrete transform, with carefully chosen sample points.

Reference-contexts: We can reduce the cost of the function evaluation by computing an approximation to the function. The fast multipole method (Greengard and Rokhlin [15], and Greengard <ref> [14] </ref>), in particular, has attracted considerable attention because the running time is proportional to n. However, implementation of the fast multipole method requires considerable care and analysis, so only sophisticated implementations are able to achieve the order n running time.

Reference-contexts: Motivation for the Gaussian transform can be obtained by showing that the Gaussian transform of the two-dimensional version of the Griewank function f (x) = 1 + i=1 x 2 200 i=1 p removes local minimizers. This function was constructed by Griewank <ref> [16] </ref> to test global optimization algorithms on problems with a large number of local minimizers.

Reference-contexts: However, in general it is not possible to define a continuous trajectory of minimizers, and thus we 16 must be prepared to jump curves. For additional information on issues related to tracing minimizers, see Gudat, Guerra Vazquez, and Jongen <ref> [17] </ref>. 5.2 Smoothing The Gaussian transform is isotropic because if we view the function f in a different coordinate system via the function h : IR n 7!

Reference-contexts: Molecular optimization problems also arise in the study of clusters; for an introduction to the problems in this area, see the books edited by Reynolds [41] and Haberland <ref> [18] </ref>. Much of the interest in clusters is due to unexpected theoretical and practical results, such as the discovery of the stable carbon cluster C 60 . Theoretical properties of clusters usually are determined by molecular dynamics simulation or by potential energy minimization. <p> A fundamental problem in cluster science is to determine the geometrical structure of clusters in their lowest energy states. Related problems include structure changes from clusters to 6 bulk matters and low energy paths between stable states. For a general review of these topics, see Haberland <ref> [18] </ref>. Clusters of argon molecules were first studied by Hoare and coworkers [25, 24, 23]. Northby [37] obtained the structures for clusters with up to 147 molecules using a lattice search algorithm, which later was improved and used for even larger clusters by Xue [52]. <p> For example, Hoare [23] used ff = 3. Potentials for other clusters can be more involved. For example, in the study of metal clusters <ref> [41, 18, 26] </ref> it is common to use potentials of the form f (x) = i6=j n X 0 X q i;j (x i x j ) A ; where p i;j : IR 3 7! IR and q i;j : IR 3 7! IR are of the form v (kxk)

Reference-contexts: Both approaches require the solution of global optimization problems. The problem of finding the least energy structure for a given molecular system arises not only in biological studies, but also in the study of large, confined ionic systems in plasma physics <ref> [19, 39, 44] </ref>. Configurations of systems with up to 200,000 ions are of special interest because phase transitions occur for systems of this size. <p> can be modeled, for example, by a function of the form f (x) = i6=j m X kx i k 2 ; (2:7) where p i;j : IR 3 7! IR is defined by p i;j (x) = v (kxk); v (r) = r 1 : (2:8) Hasse and Schiffer <ref> [19] </ref>, Rafac, Schiffer, Hangst, Dubin, and Wales [39], and Schiffer [44] studied configurations of confined ionic systems via molecular dynamics simulation.

Reference-contexts: Theoretical properties of clusters usually are determined by molecular dynamics simulation or by potential energy minimization. Small argon clusters have received considerable attention in the past (see, for example, the classical studies of Hoare <ref> [23] </ref> and Northby [37]), since they have simple potentials and structure, but current interest centers on clusters with more involved potentials. This work was supported by the Mathematical, Information, and Computational Sciences Division subprogram of the Office of Computational and Technology Research, U.S. <p> Related problems include structure changes from clusters to 6 bulk matters and low energy paths between stable states. For a general review of these topics, see Haberland [18]. Clusters of argon molecules were first studied by Hoare and coworkers <ref> [25, 24, 23] </ref>. Northby [37] obtained the structures for clusters with up to 147 molecules using a lattice search algorithm, which later was improved and used for even larger clusters by Xue [52]. <p> For example, Hoare <ref> [23] </ref> used ff = 3. Potentials for other clusters can be more involved. <p> The potential for ionic systems, on the other hand, decays slowly as r approaches infinity. Cluster problems are difficult for most global optimization strategies because they tend to have a large number of local minimizers that act as points of attraction for any local minimizer. For argon clusters, Hoare <ref> [23] </ref> found that systems with 6 m 13 atoms had 2; 4; 8; 18; 57; 145; 366; 989 different minima, respectively, and on the basis of this observation conjectured that the number of minima grew like exp (m 2 ).

For a discussion of these issues see, for example, Jellinek <ref> [26] </ref>. 7 3 Smoothing Transformations The global continuation approach to finding the global minimizer is to transform the function into a smoother function with fewer local minimizers, apply an optimization algorithm to the transformed function, and trace the minimizers back to the original function.

Reference-contexts: Recent developments of global smoothing and continuation techniques from a mathematical and computational point of view can be found in Wu [51] and More and Wu <ref> [35, 34] </ref>, while More and Wu [36] have extended the smoothing properties of the Gaussian transform to transformations with other density functions. While global smoothing is a promising approach for the solution of molecular optimization problems, many theoretical and computational issues need additional attention. <p> Saxe [42] shows that k-dimensional distance geometry problems are strongly NP-hard for all k 1. The following result of More and Wu <ref> [34] </ref> shows that obtaining an approximate solution to the distance geometry problem is also NP-hard. <p> Current implementations of the embed algorithm use a local minimizer of the problem defined by (2.4) and (2.5) as a starting point for a simulated annealing procedure. In Section 4 we will outline the proposal of More and Wu <ref> [34] </ref> for finding a solution of the distance geometry problem (2.2) by directly determining a global minimizer of the function defined by (2.4) and (2.6). 2.2 Ionic Systems The potential energy for a confined ionic system of m ions located at x 1 ; : : :; x m in R <p> As we have noted in Section 2, most of the potentials used in molecular optimization problems are sums of functions of the form f (x) = h (kxk) for some mapping h : IR 7! IR. The following result of More and Wu <ref> [34] </ref> shows that the Gaussian transform of f can be expressed in terms of one-dimensional integrals. <p> We can compute these integrals with standard techniques for numerical integration (for example, an adaptive quadrature), but these techniques usually require a large number of function evaluations. An alternative approach is to use a Gauss-Hermite approximation, as suggested by More and Wu <ref> [34] </ref>. The Gauss-Hermite approximation to the one-dimensional transform hf i (x) = p Z +1 f (x + s) exp (s 2 ) ds is obtained by using Gaussian quadratures on the integral. <p> some l 2q, there is a constant l , independent of f , such that jhf i (x) hf i ;q (x)j l l oe (x); where oe (x) = 1 fi fi f (l) (x + s) fi 2 oe 1=2 Theorem 3.5 is due to More and Wu <ref> [34] </ref>. This result shows that (3.7) is a good approximation to hf i provided &lt; 1, but that the accuracy is likely to deteriorate if &gt; 1. <p> The Hessian matrix is discontinuous at points where the argument of h i;j coincides with either l i;j or u i;j . We cannot expect to avoid these discontinuities, in particular, if l i;j or u i;j are close. More and Wu <ref> [34] </ref> used the variable-metric limited-memory code vmlm in MINPACK-2, which is an implementation of the Liu and Nocedal [33] algorithm. <p> From an 15 optimization point of view, formulation (4.6) is preferable because it allows the use of a Newton method in locmin. The computational experiments performed by More and Wu <ref> [35, 34] </ref> on various distance geometry problems show that algorithm gmin is able to find global minimizers reliably and efficiently.

Reference-contexts: Theoretical properties of clusters usually are determined by molecular dynamics simulation or by potential energy minimization. Small argon clusters have received considerable attention in the past (see, for example, the classical studies of Hoare [23] and Northby <ref> [37] </ref>), since they have simple potentials and structure, but current interest centers on clusters with more involved potentials. This work was supported by the Mathematical, Information, and Computational Sciences Division subprogram of the Office of Computational and Technology Research, U.S. <p> Related problems include structure changes from clusters to 6 bulk matters and low energy paths between stable states. For a general review of these topics, see Haberland [18]. Clusters of argon molecules were first studied by Hoare and coworkers [25, 24, 23]. Northby <ref> [37] </ref> obtained the structures for clusters with up to 147 molecules using a lattice search algorithm, which later was improved and used for even larger clusters by Xue [52].

Reference-contexts: Molecular optimization problems also arise in the study of clusters; for an introduction to the problems in this area, see the books edited by Reynolds <ref> [41] </ref> and Haberland [18].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We are concerned, in particular, with molecular optimization problems that arise in the study of protein structures in biophysical chemistry. If we adopt the hypothesis that the native protein structure corresponds to the global minimum of the protein energy <ref> [43, 48] </ref>, then the protein structure is determined by minimizing a potential energy function in con-formational space. If the protein structure is determined from bounds on distances between pairs of atoms and other geometric constraints on the protein, then distance geometry [9, 20] techniques are required. <p> This property allows the optimization procedure to skip less interesting local minimizers and to concentrate on regions with average low function values, where a global minimizer is most likely to be located. Global smoothing was first proposed in the diffusion equation method for protein conformation by Scheraga and coworkers <ref> [38, 27, 28, 29, 43] </ref>. A similar approach was used in the packet annealing algorithm of Shalloway [48, 47] and in the algorithms of Coleman, Shal-loway, and Wu [7, 8] for molecular conformation problems.

We also note that other density functions may be considered; an analysis of these generalized transformations can be found in More and Wu [36]. <p> Although these plots are suggestive, it is important to keep in mind that the global smoothing approach is not guaranteed to succeed in all cases. The following result of Wu <ref> [51] </ref> explains why the Gaussian transform reduces the high-frequency components of the function and eliminates local minimizers as increases. <p> If we wish to emphasize some directions, then Wu <ref> [51] </ref> suggested the use of the anisotropic Gaussian transform defined by hf i fl (x) = n=2 j det flj IR n i j for any nonsingular matrix fl. <p> For this transformation hhi fl (P x) = hf i fl (x) if P fl is orthogonal, so that the scaling in fl controls the smoothing.
