Reference-contexts: A very similar calculus was developed and analyzed in the categorical context by Barber [Bar96]. It differs from more traditional treatments by Abramsky [Abr93], Troel-stra [Tro93], Bierman [Bie94] and Albrecht et al. <ref> [ABCJ94] </ref> in that structural rules remain completely implicit. This has advantages and disadvantages. From the operational point of view, storage operations (weakening and contraction) are not as explicit as, say, in Abram-sky's or Bierman's calculi.

Reference-contexts: The calculus does not yet cover full intuitionistic linear logic, since we postpone treatment of negation, multiplicative falsehood, and the why-not exponential which require new considerations.
