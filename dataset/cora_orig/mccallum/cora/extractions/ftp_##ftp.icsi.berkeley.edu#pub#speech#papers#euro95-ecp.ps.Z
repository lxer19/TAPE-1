Abstract: In this paper we describe a completely automatic algorithm that builds multiple pronunciation word models by expanding baseform pronunciations with a set of candidate phonological rules. We show how to train the probabilities of these phonological rules, and how to use these probabilities to assign pronunciation probabilities to words not seen in the training corpus. The algorithm we propose is an instance of the class of techniques we call Exploratory Computational Phonology.

Reference-contexts: Table 1 gives the rules used in these experiments. Our baseform dictionary was made by combining five different on-line pronunciation dictionaries: CMU (CMU 1993), LIMSI <ref> (Lamel 1993) </ref>, PRONLEX (COMLEX 1994), BRITPRON (Robinson 1994), and a text-to-speech system. <p> Notice that the pruned, untrained lexicons produce a word-error only about 3% worse than the fully trained lexicon. We also ran an experiment in which we used our rules to augment the LIMSI lexicon <ref> (Lamel 1993) </ref> with extra pronunciations. We found that our pronunciations did not improve the LIMSI lexicon at all; in fact the word error rose with the new pronunciations. However, since the LIMSI pronunciations were tuned on exactly this corpus, this is perhaps not the best comparison.

Reference-contexts: Our algorithm runs only about 3% worse than actually training the pronunciation probabilities directly with a complete forced Viterbi alignment. We hope in the future to test out these rules on databases of fast speakers <ref> (Mirghafori et al. 1995) </ref> and spontaneous speech, and to create new rules modeling foreign-accent effects.
