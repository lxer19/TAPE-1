Abstract: This paper describes the dialogue manager of the TRAINS-92 system. The general dialogue model is described with emphasis on the mentalistic attitudes represented.

Reference-contexts: This interpretation is a formula in Episodic Logic [Schubert and Hwang, 1989]. Parsing, semantic interpretation, and reference resolution and inference are steps in the interpretation process. The user's processed utterances are translated into a knowledge representation language built in RHET <ref> [Allen and Miller, 1989] </ref> and passed over to the dialogue manager for speech act analysis and further action, if necessary. <p> In addition, the system must maintain beliefs about the user's beliefs and about mutual beliefs both to interpret user utterances and formulate its own expressions coherently. These modalities are represented in the TRAINS system as belief spaces, maintained by the RHET KR system <ref> [Allen and Miller, 1989] </ref>. 2.2 Domain Plans From the point of view of the Dialogue Manager, Domain Plans are abstract entities which contain a number of parts.

Reference-contexts: More detailed information on the design and scope of the system can be found in <ref> [Allen and Schubert, 1991] </ref>. 1.1 The Dialogue Manager The dialogue manager is responsible for maintaining the flow of conversation, and making sure that the conversational goals are met.

Reference-contexts: Seen this way, the conversational participants can have different ideas about the composition of a particular plan, even though they are both talking about the "same" plan. The structure of TRAINS-92 domain plans and view of plans as arguments are described in detail in <ref> [Ferguson, 1992] </ref>. In order to keep track of the negotiation of the composition of a plan during a conversation, a number of plan contexts are used. These are shown in the dashed boxes in Figure 1, along with their related belief modalities.

Reference-contexts: The TRAINS-92 system represents the turn with a variable which indicates the current holder. The turn is changed by means of turn-taking acts which are realized in particular utterances. turn-taking acts are described in more detail in [Traum and Hinkel-man, 1992]. * Discourse Segmentation information <ref> [Grosz and Sidner, 1986] </ref> is kept for a variety of purposes in linguistic interpretation and generation, including the ability to determine the possible referents for a referring expression, and the intentional relations between utterances. The currently open segment structure will guide how certain utterances will be interpreted.

Reference-contexts: Currently only the Core Speech act level has been fully implemented, with partial implementations of the other three levels. The method of analysis is based on the one proposed by <ref> [Hinkelman, 1990] </ref>, using linguistic information as a filter to decide which acts are possible interpretations, and using plan based and contextual information to choose the most likely among the possible interpretations.

Reference-contexts: System Plan does not inherit from System Proposed, because the system may have erroneously com municated some portion of it's private plan (which would then lead the system to try to perform a repair). In Pollack's terms, the constituents of the plan spaces will be (partial) recipes for action <ref> [Pollack, 1990] </ref>. The mental state of having a plan is not achieved until the shared plan is fully formed and the system adopts the intention to execute it. 2.3 Discourse Goals The system maintains a set of Discourse Goals in order to use the conversation to satisfy its own goals.

Reference-contexts: Of particular relevance to the dialogue manager are speech actions. These are the primary means by which the dialogue manager changes the conversational state and recognizes such changes. We are using the multi-level Conversation Acts model <ref> [Traum and Allen, 1991; Traum and Hinkelman, 1992] </ref> of action in conversation.
