Title: Iterated Revision and Minimal Change of Conditional Beliefs  
Author: Craig Boutilier 
Affiliation: University of British Columbia  
Date: 1995  
Note: To appear, Journal of Philosophical Logic,  
Abstract: We describe a model of iterated belief revision that extends the AGM theory of revision to account for the effect of a revision on the conditional beliefs of an agent. In particular, this model ensures that an agent makes as few changes as possible to the conditional component of its belief set. Adopting the Ramsey test, minimal conditional revision provides acceptance conditions for arbitrary right-nested conditionals. We show that problem of determining acceptance of any such nested conditional can be reduced to acceptance tests for unnested conditionals. Thus, iterated revision can be accomplished in a virtual manner, using uniterated revision.

Reference-contexts: It has been suggested by a number of people that nested conditionals should be reduced to unnested conditionals with all antecedents conjoined to form a single antecedent, Adams <ref> [1] </ref> and Levi [23] among them. This reduction is sanctioned by the MC-revision model for nested conditionals with compatible antecedents. But as described in Section 4, this is not the case when incompatible antecedents are present.

Reference-contexts: Thus, MC-revision may prove to be a useful approximation method in quantitative settings as well. The utility of MC-revision is especially noticeable if new evidence tends not to contradict earlier evidence. Darwiche and Pearl <ref> [12] </ref> propose two postulates extending the eight AGM postulates that govern iterated revision. These impose rather mild constraints on the conditionals (or ordering) that results from a revision; indeed, both Spohn's OCF model (or more accurately a suitable qualitative abstraction thereof) and MC-revision satisfy these postulates. <p> Indeed, the MC-revision model cannot account for this circumstance when incompatible 18 The party example is a rewording of the example in <ref> [12] </ref> of observing a red bird.

Reference-contexts: The process of revision requires some care, for A may contradict elements of K. Alchourr on, G ardenfors and Makinson [2] propose a method for logically delimiting the scope of acceptable revisions. To this end, the AGM postulates below, are maintained to hold for any reasonable notion of revision <ref> [15] </ref>. (R1) K fl A is a belief set (i.e. deductively closed).

Reference-contexts: We are also exploring the application of these ideas to the processes of J-conditionalization and L-conditionalization. These models were proposed by Goldszmidt and Pearl <ref> [18] </ref> to capture changes in belief that have degrees of certainty attached, these degrees corresponding to Spohn's OCFs. Both extensions of MC-revision (either probabilistic or possibilistic) offer ways of attaching quantitative strength measurements to our conditionals and revising these conditionals.

Reference-contexts: We note that the dual of an entrenchment ordering is a plausibility ordering on sentences. A sentence A is more plausible than B just when :A is less entrenched than :B, and means that A would be more readily accepted than B if the opportunity arose. Grove <ref> [19] </ref> studied this relationship and its connection to the AGM theory. 2.1 A Semantic Model Our extension of the AGM theory will be based on a slightly different semantic representation of revision functions. Grove [19] observed that an entrenchment relation over sentences can be represented using a plausibility ordering over models. <p> Grove <ref> [19] </ref> studied this relationship and its connection to the AGM theory. 2.1 A Semantic Model Our extension of the AGM theory will be based on a slightly different semantic representation of revision functions. Grove [19] observed that an entrenchment relation over sentences can be represented using a plausibility ordering over models. Our semantics captures this intuition, though it is (cosmetically) distinguished by the use of an explicit ranking function rather than Grove's system of spheres.

Hansson <ref> [21] </ref> also associates potentially distinct revision functions with equivalent belief sets. 8 The second criticism is of a more pragmatic nature and is the point we address in the rest of the paper. <p> So while the ordering of entrenchment can change as K evolves, these changes are predetermined by the global ordering; the entrenchment ordering associated with K cannot depend on how K evolved. This stands in contrast with our model, where the ordering itself can be revised. Hansson <ref> [21] </ref> makes a similar observation, that many systems of iterated change fix the connection between objective and extended sets.

This celebrated triviality result has been devoted considerable attention. But very compelling arguments (e.g., <ref> [23, 27] </ref>) have been put forth suggesting that the postulates of the AGM theory should not hold in the case of nonobjective beliefs. <p> In fact, from a purely logical perspective, this is probably all we want to say about M fl A . If one changes an objective belief, it is impossible in general to predict what becomes of one's conditionals. 7 Similar observations have been made by Levi <ref> [23] </ref>, Rott [29] and Hansson [21].

This reduction is sanctioned by the MC-revision model for nested conditionals with compatible antecedents. But as described in Section 4, this is not the case when incompatible antecedents are present. <p> To appear, Journal of Philosophical Logic, 1995 5 CONCLUDING REMARKS 34 antecedents are involved. In contrast, our model provides non-trivial acceptance conditions for nested conditionals such as A &gt; (:A &gt; B). Levi <ref> [23] </ref> is rather critical of the enterprise of determining truth or acceptance conditions for nested conditionals, or even allowing conditionals to be part of a belief set. He offers the opinion that an element of a belief set or corpus ought to be practicable as a standard of serious possibility. <p> Upon reflection, however, it becomes clear that the postulates, in particular postulates pertaining to consistent revisions such as (R4), lose much of their appeal when applied to conditional belief sets. As argued convincingly by Levi <ref> [23] </ref> and Rott [27], among others, the proper escape from triviality requires relaxing the requirements of the AGM theory when discussing non-objective belief sets. 5.4 Extensions There are a number of interesting avenues that remain to be explored. This model is restricted to right-nested conditionals, or propositional revisions.
