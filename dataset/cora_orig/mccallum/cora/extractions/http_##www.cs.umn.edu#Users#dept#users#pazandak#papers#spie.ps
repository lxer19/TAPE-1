Title: The Language Components of DAMSEL: An Embedable Event-driven Declarative Multimedia Speciflcation Language  
Author: Paul Pazandak Jaideep Srivastava 
Affiliation: Distributed Multimedia Center University Of Minnesota  
Abstract: This paper provides an overview of the three language components of DAMSEL, a framework being implemented at the University of Minnesota. It is comprised of an embedable dynamic multimedia speciflcation language, and supporting execution environments. The goal of DAMSEL is to explore language constructs and execution environments for next-generation interactive multimedia applications. DAMSEL supports dynamic, event-driven speciflcations for the retrieval, presentation, modiflcation, analysis, and storage of multimedia data. Dynamic speciflcations enable system, application, and user-media interactions to afiect the run-time behavior. The temporal language component of DAMSEL contains two primitives for event-driven temporal speciflcation supporting causation and inhibition. Speciflcations require (extensible) behavioral parameters to be chosen, enabling very powerful temporal relations to be deflned. The dataow language component uses a dataow paradigm, whereby data streams ow from source to sink. Sources are live devices, or storage facilities, while sinks may include simple windows, and connections to complex layouts. Modiflcation and analysis of a data stream takes place en route. The presentation component supports the speciflcation of data stream connections to user interfaces. DAMSEL components support conditional and constraint logics, enabling more complex spec-iflcations than currently possible. DAMSEL also supports an open systems view, enabling current software to be used within it's architecture. keywords: multimedia, speciflcation language, synchronization, event-driven, run-time event manager, embedded language, event detection
