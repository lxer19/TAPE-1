Abstract: Providing cost-effective video-on-demand (VOD) services necessitates reducing the required bandwidth for transporting video over high-speed networks. In this paper, we investigate efficient schemes for transporting archived MPEG-coded video over a VOD distribution network. A video stream is characterized by a time-varying traffic envelope, which provides an upper bound on the bit rate. Using such envelopes, we show that video streams can be scheduled for transmission over the network such that the per-stream allocated bandwidth is significantly less than the source peak rate. In a previous work [13], we investigated stream scheduling and bandwidth allocation using global traffic envelopes and homogeneous streams. In this paper, we generalize the scheduling scheme in [13] to include the heterogeneous case. We then investigate the allocation problem under window-based traffic envelopes, which provide tighter bounds on the bit rate than global traffic envelopes. Using window-based envelopes, we introduce three stream-scheduling schemes for multiplexing video connections at a server. The performance of these schemes is evaluated under static and dynamic scenarios. Our results indicate a significant reduction in the per-stream allocated bandwidth when stream scheduling is used. While this reduction is obtained through statistical multiplexing, the transported streams are guaranteed stringent, deterministic quality of service (i.e., zero loss rate and small, bounded delay). In contrast to video smoothing, our approach require virtually no buffer at the set-top box since frames are delivered at their playback rate.

Reference-contexts: Improving the utilization necessitates reducing the variability of the bit rate by means of temporal averaging (i.e., smoothing) on a stream-by-stream basis or spatial averaging (i.e., aggregation) via statistical multiplexing (stream batching and multicast-based approaches have also been proposed <ref> [1, 17, 15] </ref>). Video smoothing has been the focus of many studies (for example, [3, 10, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 23, 25]).

Reference-contexts: With smaller window sizes, the bounds are tighter and the bandwidth allocation strategy is more effective. As a limiting case, the window size can be taken as the whole duration of the movie, resulting in a global traffic envelope, which was used in <ref> [13] </ref>. By using window-based envelopes and by appropriate stream scheduling at the server, the aggregate traffic has a peak rate that is much smaller than the 2 sum of the peak rates of individual sources. <p> Note that I (i) (i) (i) parameters N (i) and M (i) describe the GOP pattern of s i . The five parameters were used in <ref> [13] </ref> to construct a "global" traffic envelope, which is depicted in Figure 2 (solid line). The simplicity of the global traffic envelope makes it attractive even for real-time video, where the maximum frame sizes may be estimated or policed according to predetermined values. <p> The vector u completely specifies the degree of overlap among the GOPs of different streams. In the homogeneous case (i.e., identical traffic envelopes), it was shown <ref> [13] </ref> that an "optimal" arrangement that minimizes the allocated bandwidth for n multiplexed streams is given by: u fl = (0; 1; : : : ; N 1; 0; 1; : : : ; N 1; : : : ; w times 0; 1; : : : ; n wN 1)
