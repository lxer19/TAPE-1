Title: Exponential Sums and Circuits with a Single Threshold Gate

Abstract: Consider circuits consisting of a threshold gate at the top, Mod m gates at the next level (for a fixed m), and polylog fan-in AND gates at the lowest level. It is a difficult and important open problem to obtain exponential lower bounds for such circuits. Here we prove exponential lower bounds for restricted versions of this model, in which each Mod m - of-AND subcircuit is a symmetric function of the inputs to that subcircuit. We show that if q is a prime not dividing m, the Mod q function requires exponential size circuits of this type. This generalizes recent results and techniques of Cai, Green and Thierauf [CGT] (which held only for q = 2) and Goldmann (which held only for depth two threshold over Mod m circuits). As a further generalization of the [CGT] result, the symmetry condition on the Mod m sub-circuits can be relaxed somewhat, still resulting in an exponential lower bound. The basis of the proof is to reduce the problem to estimating an exponential sum, which generalizes the notion of "correlation" studied by [CGT]. This identifies the type of exponential sum that will be instrumental in proving the general case. Along the way we substantially simplify previous proofs.

Reference-contexts: While obtaining good bounds for exponential sums can be very difficult, the more general results entailing elaborate techniques and deep results from algebraic geometry [Ka] and/or analysis <ref> [AKC] </ref>, the results of this paper offer encouragement that the required techniques will not be quite that hard. This is suggested by the following observations. The techniques for estimating exponential sums in number theory are quite sophisticated even for univariate polynomials.

While the known algebraic techniques will very likely play a role, we are clearly facing a problem of a different nature.

Although it is much simpler, the proof contains some of the essential ingredients of the proof of the main theorem. The key is to show that factorizes into n factors of norm less than 1. Theorem 2.3.
