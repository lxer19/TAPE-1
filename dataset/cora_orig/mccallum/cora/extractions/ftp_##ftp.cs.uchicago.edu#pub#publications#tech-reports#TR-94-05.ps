Reference-contexts: We have noted in section 3 that the histogram space is a (n 1)- dimensional simplex. It is a calculus exercise to compute the volume of the standard simplex (see <ref> (Apostol, 1969, page 416) </ref>) and then to derive the volume of H from it. Vol (H) = n N n1 The volume of a sphere depends on the metric that we use on H. <p> Consequently, we have Vol (S L 1 (n 1; t)) = (n 1)! The volume of a (n 1)-dimensional L 2 -sphere is Vol (S L 2 (n 1; t)) = n1 ( n1 t n1 Capacity and Sensitivity of Color Histogram Indexing 15 (see <ref> (Apostol, 1969, page 411) </ref>).

Reference-contexts: All the above mentioned papers report good results, but none of the algorithms has been tested on a truly large image database. The algorithms in (Swain & Ballard, 1991; Funt & Finlayson, 1991; Stricker, 1992) were tested on less than 100 images. <ref> (Engelson & McDermott, 1991) </ref> used 168 images to test their algorithm. The image database used in (Niblack et al., 1993; Equitz et al., 1993) is of size 1000. In this paper we present a careful theoretical analysis of one indexing technique.

Reference-contexts: The reader who is interested in the implementation of such an algorithm is referred to (Stricker, 1992) for the L 1 -case and to <ref> (Equitz et al., 1993) </ref> for the L 2 -case. Both papers discuss efficient implementations of this algorithm. 3 The histogram space Before we can study the algorithm we need to investigate the metrical properties of the histogram space.

Reference-contexts: But there exists a rich literature on bounds for A (n; 2l; w) (see for example (van Lint, 1992; Best, Brouwer et al., 1978; Graham & Sloan, 1980)). We use a lower bound for A (n; 2l; w) from <ref> (Graham & Sloan, 1980) </ref> and theorem 4 to derive an explicitly computable lower bound for the capacity. Corollary 5 Let q be the smallest prime power such that q n. <p> Then the capacity satisfies the follow ing inequality: C (H; d; t) max 1 w Proof: From its meaning in coding theory it is clear that the maximum in theorem 4 is attained for the minimal value of l, i.e., l = dffe. <ref> (Graham & Sloan, 1980, page 39) </ref> contains a short discussion on which lower bounds of A (n; 2l; w) provide the tightest approximation on which range of param eters. Based on this discussion we choose (Graham & Sloan, 1980, theorem 4) to establish the assertion of the corollary. <p> Based on this discussion we choose <ref> (Graham & Sloan, 1980, theorem 4) </ref> to establish the assertion of the corollary. To expose the strengths and the weaknesses of our lower bound, we compare its value with the capacity found by using a Monte Carlo algorithm. <p> Our lower bound is tighter for larger values of the threshold t. This stems from the coding theory bound that we used to prove our result. Tighter approximations for small values of t can be obtained in same way as we have shown by using <ref> (Graham & Sloan, 1980, theorem 7) </ref>. For small values of t the capacity of the histogram space is so large that we normally do not have to worry about "overfilling" the histogram space.

Reference-contexts: Now we can formulate the indexing algorithm concisely: For a fixed retrieval threshold t, a model is going to be retrieved if its histogram is t-similar to the histogram I. The reader who is interested in the implementation of such an algorithm is referred to <ref> (Stricker, 1992) </ref> for the L 1 -case and to (Equitz et al., 1993) for the L 2 -case. Both papers discuss efficient implementations of this algorithm. 3 The histogram space Before we can study the algorithm we need to investigate the metrical properties of the histogram space.

Reference-contexts: We denote the capacity by C (H; d; t). The capacity also depends on the distribution of the colors in the images. It is very hard to account for an arbitrary color distribution and hence we study the case where the distribution is uniform across the color space. In <ref> (Swain & Ballard, 1991) </ref> the authors propose to measure the capacity by dividing the volume of the histogram space by the volume of a (n 1)- dimensional sphere of radius t 2 . The centers of the spheres correspond to the histograms. <p> Appendix A: "Simple" sphere packing is not appli cable Here we show that the simple sphere packing argument given in <ref> (Swain & Ballard, 1991) </ref> does not approximate the capacity of the histogram space. We have noted in section 3 that the histogram space is a (n 1)- dimensional simplex. <p> Thus, the quotient to approximate the capacity which proposed in <ref> (Swain & Ballard, 1991) </ref> is Vol (H) = n N n1 and Vol (S L 2 ) p 2 + 1) p n1 Note that in (Swain & Ballard, 1991) a factor of 2 n+1 is missing in the quotient (2). <p> Thus, the quotient to approximate the capacity which proposed in <ref> (Swain & Ballard, 1991) </ref> is Vol (H) = n N n1 and Vol (S L 2 ) p 2 + 1) p n1 Note that in (Swain & Ballard, 1991) a factor of 2 n+1 is missing in the quotient (2). The quotient (2) is less than 1 if t N 2 n 2 (n1) . For large n, the quotient (3) is much smaller than the quotient (2).
