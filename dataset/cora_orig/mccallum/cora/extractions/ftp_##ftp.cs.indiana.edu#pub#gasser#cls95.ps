Title: A Dynamic Approach to Rhythm in Language: Toward a Temporal Phonology  
Author: Robert Port, Fred Cummins and Michael Gasser 
Date: August 7, 1995  
Affiliation: Linguistics and Cognitive Science Indiana University  
Abstract: It is proposed that the theory of dynamical systems offers appropriate tools to model many phonological aspects of both speech production and perception. A dynamic account of speech rhythm is shown to be useful for description of both Japanese mora timing and English timing in a phrase repetition task. This orientation contrasts fundamentally with the more familiar symbolic approach to phonology, in which time is modeled only with sequentially arrayed symbols. It is proposed that an adaptive oscillator offers a useful model for perceptual entrainment (or `locking in') to the temporal patterns of speech production. This helps to explain why speech is often perceived to be more regular than experimental measurements seem to justify. Because dynamic models deal with real time, they also help us understand how languages can differ in their temporal detail|contributing to foreign accents, for example. The fact that languages differ greatly in their temporal detail suggests that these effects are not mere motor universals, but that dynamical models are intrinsic components of the phonological characterization of language.

Reference-contexts: Many communities also have conventional forms of group recitation or responsive reading where a text is recited in unison (e.g., the American "Pledge of Allegiance"). Given the apparent appeal of such genres of speech, one might look for similarities between these styles and normal spoken language <ref> (as proposed by Abercrombie, 1967) </ref> in order to reveal the structure of language itself. <p> Abercrombie asserted boldly that "all human speech possesses rhythm" and further claimed that all languages in 5 the world are either stress-timed or syllable-timed <ref> (Abercrombie, 1967) </ref>. He proposed that listeners who speak the former rhythmic type of language would have "expectations about the regularity of succession" of stresses and the latter type would have expectations about syllables. But the relationship between such perceptual structures and quantitative real-time measurements has remained controversial among linguists.

Reference-contexts: One cannot measure a mora in isolation, but only in the context of measurements of its neighboring moras. Isolated measurement will lead to the (correct but misleading) observation that individual moras differ greatly in their duration <ref> (Beckman, 1982) </ref>. Let us look more closely at the internal timing of a few words. Figure 2 shows the segmental durations of another set of words produced in carrier sentences (Port et al., 1987, Experiment 3).

Reference-contexts: Japanese has other segmental phonological rules, such as the one that devoices i and u between voiceless consonants, making phonemic sukiyaki be pronounced more like s:kiyaki (See legend in Figure 2).

Not even word boundaries (Port et al., 1987) or imposition of contrastive stress (Bradlow et al., 1995) perturb the mora-timing 10 for 4 mora Japanese words averaged over 6 repetitions by 9 Japanese speakers.

Reference-contexts: It also poses a challenge for mechanisms for perception that can account for these regularities that are apparent to native speakers of Japanese <ref> (and even to some second-language speakers, cf. Bloch, 1950) </ref>, at least after being called to their attention by teachers. To make sure the empirical phenomenon is appreciated, let us look at some Japanese timing data.

Reference-contexts: The phonetic component of the speech production system is supposed to take the symbolic units of phonology as input and produce movements by the speech articulators (Chomsky-Halle, 1968).

Reference-contexts: The degree of phase adjustment depends on the particular model. There are two main variants, phase-reset models and continuous coupling models. In phase-reset models, like McAuley's model described above, the oscillator resets its phase to zero each time an input pulse occurs within its coupling window. In continuous models <ref> (e.g., Large and Kolen, 1994) </ref>, the phase adjustment is a function of the deviation of the oscillator's phase from zero when the input pulse occurs. Period coupling (that is, frequency adjustment) is required for smooth performance if oscillators may begin with periods different from that of the input signal.

Reference-contexts: For example, it is likely that temporal alternations of strong and weak elements in speech production are widespread across languages| 4 possibly even universal <ref> (as proposed by Liberman and Prince, 1977) </ref>. It also appears likely that periodicity or near periodicity at some temporal level or another is a universal of language (as was claimed by Abercrombie, 1967 and hinted at by Pike, 1945).

Reference-contexts: A modest amount of variation will not prevent entrainment to a moving average of the period of the input, and may even improve entrainment in certain circumstances <ref> (see McAuley, 1995b) </ref>. This system can be implemented computationally with just a small set of equations. It will quickly (within a few cycles) speed up or slow down so as to approximate the frequency of the inputs. <p> In order to work toward development of a hierarchical system appropriate for meter, an oscillator also requires an associated activation or output that will serve as a local measure of how well it matches either external input or the rate of other oscillators. In McAuley's model <ref> (McAuley, 1995b) </ref>, output is a weighted sum of the oscillator's phases when it is reset. Thus, it is a useful measure of how well the oscillator is synchronized to recent inputs.

Reference-contexts: In McAuley's model (McAuley, 1995b), output is a weighted sum of the oscillator's phases when it is reset. Thus, it is a useful measure of how well the oscillator is synchronized to recent inputs. In Miller, Scarborough, and Jones' music model <ref> (Miller et al., 1988) </ref>, oscillator activation measures how well an oscillator characterizes the input pattern and how well it agrees with other oscillators in terms of a set of metrical constraints. <p> A model suitable for speech needs a way of representing rhythmical patterns, something which is not provided by a set of unconnected adaptive oscillators or by the simple connections between the units of Miller, Scarborough, and Jones' network <ref> (Miller et al., 1988) </ref>. We are working on development of a model that consists of a network 24 of adaptive oscillators with varying resting periods and one or more input units that are excited by pulses of varying amplitude.

Reference-contexts: Bloch, 1950), at least after being called to their attention by teachers. To make sure the empirical phenomenon is appreciated, let us look at some Japanese timing data. In one experiment, several sets of words were constructed by lengthening words by one mora at a time <ref> (Port et al., 1987) </ref>. As shown in Table 1, this yielded a number of words at each word length from 1 mora to 6 or 7 moras. <p> Isolated measurement will lead to the (correct but misleading) observation that individual moras differ greatly in their duration (Beckman, 1982). Let us look more closely at the internal timing of a few words. Figure 2 shows the segmental durations of another set of words produced in carrier sentences <ref> (Port et al., 1987, Experiment 3) </ref>. The words are kuka, kuga, kaka and kaga (some of which are nonsense words in Japanese). One sees in the figure such well-known (and putatively 9 word duration as a function of the number of moras at two different speaking rates. <p> This is because other segments within the mora and the adjacent moras, ka and ga, have adjusted their duration to compensate. The main effects here, including the effect of medial consonant voicing on the initial stop, are all statistically significant <ref> (Port et al., 1987) </ref>. Japanese has other segmental phonological rules, such as the one that devoices i and u between voiceless consonants, making phonemic sukiyaki be pronounced more like s:kiyaki (See legend in Figure 2). <p> But this rule and others do not interfere with the moraic temporal structure of a word (Beckman, 1984). Not even word boundaries <ref> (Port et al., 1987) </ref> or imposition of contrastive stress (Bradlow et al., 1995) perturb the mora-timing 10 for 4 mora Japanese words averaged over 6 repetitions by 9 Japanese speakers.

Reference-contexts: universally to be organized around a fixed number of beats (most often 2, 3 or 4) per measure. 16 Given what we currently know about the details of Japanese timing, such nested hierarchical structures are not obvious (but bimoraic feet have been proposed for this language based on phonological evidence <ref> (Poser, 1990) </ref>.) But how can we discover the extent to which English has a music-like hierarchical rhythmic structure? One method would be to ask speakers to read a poem or song lyric.

Reference-contexts: Since 3 we focus primarily on the perception problem, there are usually no physical masses involved. Some region of neural tissue is responsible for implementing these dynamics. Since this perceptual dynamic is learned differently for each language, it would form the basis of many aspects of foreign accent <ref> (Tajima et al., 1994) </ref>. <p> The mora structure of Japanese is peculiar to this language, and the rhythmic structure of English is found only in English and its close relatives. Indeed, precisely these differences constitute a major source of foreign accent and are an important reason why foreign accented speech has reduced intelligibility <ref> (Tajima et al., 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Note that the first vowel in the word /kuka/ is largely devoiced and thus is classified as aspiration. 11 constraint. Some lengthening of moras before phrase boundaries in conver-sational speech, however, is now well-attested <ref> (Takeda et al., 1986) </ref>. These results show that the traditional observation about the regularity of mora timing is remarkably accurate, but only when time is measured in some way that smoothes the measurements over a time window that includes at least several moras.
