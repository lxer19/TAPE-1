Abstract: Markov decision theory has been successfully used in adaptive routing in traditional circuit-switched networks. When extending Markov decision based routing algorithms to future Broadband Integrated Service Digital Networks (B-ISDN's), the required computational complexity becomes extremely high. In this paper, we propose an approach towards adaptive routing in multirate networks using a Markov decision theoretic framework which maintains low computational complexity while still providing quite good routing information. In this approach, each link is modeled as a birth-death process to reduce the state space size and a policy iteration method from Markov decision theory is iteratively applied to achieve better network performance. Our results show that routing algorithms based on this approach yield better performance than least-load path routing (LLP) without incurring any significant increase in computational complexity.

Thus, numerous studies, e.g., <ref> [7, 1] </ref>, have proposed a link independence assumption and a consequent decomposition of the path cost into a set of separable link costs, referred to as a path cost separability assumption. In the following, we first introduce these two assumptions. <p> Poisson processes with rate ` k . 2. a call carried on an n-link path behaves like n independent calls, i.e., the link holding times for the call on each of the n single links are statistically independent. * The path cost separability assumption: This assumption was first introduced in <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> A simple approach is to execute the policy iteration only once and assume that the initial policy is a direct routing policy regardless of the routing policy being used <ref> [1] </ref>. With this assumption, we obtain the link shadow prices by modeling each link as a Markov process with a cost as described below. Let d be a direct routing policy. <p> Otherwise, e k (y ` ; ) is a zero vector. Thus the link shadow prices can be obtained by solving the set of equations (3) once the traffic load offered to each link is known. In <ref> [1] </ref>, the values of the link offered traffic loads correspond to the traffic assignments of the optimal non- alternate routing policy. Later studies [7, 14, 16] estimate the actual traffic load through on-line measurements during network operation rather than relying on such a priori traffic estimation. <p> Path cost: The cost of adding a class k call on a path with links j 1 ; :::; j m , in the respective states i 1 ; :::; i m , is given by <ref> [1] </ref>: path cost = m X p k (i n ): (8) Path selection: The priority ASDR policy adopts a modified path selection method which assigns higher priority to short paths.

LLP has been shown to be very efficient <ref> [3, 18] </ref>, particularly when coupled with an appropriate trunk reservation policy [24]. Under LLP with a trunk reservation policy, a call is first offered to the direct link.

Reference-contexts: The purpose of this paper is to develop adaptive routing algorithms for multirate networks based on the MDP approach. Implementing MDP-based adaptive routing schemes in multirate networks is extremely difficult because of the complexity of the network. In <ref> [14] </ref>, Dziong and Mason first extended their previous work on traditional circuit-switched networks to multirate circuit-switched networks handling multiple classes of calls, each with its own bandwidth requirement. <p> The first policy simply follows ASDR. When a call is carried on a multi-link path, the individual link loss is set equal to the revenue loss for rejecting the call in ASDR. The second policy corresponds to the MDPD policy proposed in <ref> [14] </ref>, in which the revenue loss of rejecting a call offered to a multi-link path is distributed among the links on the path. <p> We then compare the performance of the four routing policies. Section 6 concludes our study. 2 The MDP Approach Towards Routing In this section, we first formulate the routing problem in multirate networks as a continuous-time Markov decision process <ref> [14] </ref>. <p> We assume that there is no additional cost associated with any of the actions of accepting a call, rejecting a call, or completing a call. The performance metric in which we are interested is the fractional reward loss <ref> [14, 17] </ref>, which is defined as the ratio of the loss revenue to the expected offered revenue. <p> To simplify equation (2), let p ` Equation (2) can then be rewritten as (x + ffi w X k;j k (y ` ): Here p ` k (y ` ) is referred to as the state-dependent link shadow price <ref> [14] </ref>, and can be viewed as the cost of adding a class k call on link ` when the link is in state y ` . <p> Thus the link shadow prices can be obtained by solving the set of equations (3) once the traffic load offered to each link is known. In [1], the values of the link offered traffic loads correspond to the traffic assignments of the optimal non- alternate routing policy. Later studies <ref> [7, 14, 16] </ref> estimate the actual traffic load through on-line measurements during network operation rather than relying on such a priori traffic estimation. <p> with 200 circuits and two classes of traffic that each requires 1 or 2 circuits at a time, respectively, contains 10201 states! Thus, it is not practical to obtain the set of state-dependent link shadow prices by solving the set of linear equations in the value determination step, as in <ref> [14] </ref>. Our approach is to develop an approximation to the link state dynamics that yields a birth-death process. This allows us to derive a set of simple expressions for computing link shadow prices. <p> i &lt; C; (5) where E ( ; i) = i! j=0 P i 1 Q n1 j and K X r j j C ((C) (C 1)): (7) In order to compute the link shadow prices, we need on-line measurements of the link offered loads, f ` k g <ref> [14, 16] </ref>. <p> This idea can also be applied to the case of allocating the revenue loss of rejecting a multi-link call among the individual links. Four allocations are studied in <ref> [14] </ref> and have been shown to exhibit comparable performances. However, our numerical results show that this, in general, is not true. In our study, we consider two allocations. <p> Therefore, the computation of the link reward loss for class k calls, r ` k , needs to account for these differences. As suggested in <ref> [14] </ref>, the link reward loss for rejecting a class k call is computed as 15 follows: r ` P k; ` P k; where ` is the set of paths which contain link `, and ` k; is the measured offered load which will be specified later. <p> The estimated offered loads, ` k; , are then used in equation (9) for computing the link loss. Path cost: The method of computing path costs in priority MDPD is the same as in ASDR. Notice that path net-gain defined in <ref> [14] </ref> is equivalent to (r k path cost), where path cost is defined in equation (8). Consider now the MDPD' policy. It was demonstrated in [17] that priority should not always be given to direct links.

Reference-contexts: We first model each link as a birth-death process by applying recent results from Chung and Ross <ref> [15] </ref>. We then form a Markov decision process based on this birth-death process, using a similar formulation as in the Adaptive State-Dependent Routing scheme (ASDR) in [16]. <p> The call holding time for a class k call is assumed to be exponentially distributed with mean 1= k where 1= 1 = 1. Such a network, as described above, is referred to as a multirate network <ref> [15] </ref>. A multirate network can be used to describe both ISDN's and future B-ISDN's. First, when it is used to describe an ISDN network with Synchronous Transfer Mode (STM), a unit of bandwidth is equivalent to a time slot (or channel). <p> this model. 3.1 A Simplified Link Model Wilkinson [22] showed that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the link occupancy of a link with non-Poisson arrivals can be very accurately approximated by a negative binomial distribution when the link blocking probability is higher than 0.001. 10 Recently, Chung and Ross <ref> [15] </ref> have shown that such an approximation can also be applied to multirate loss networks, and that, for the purpose of computing blocking probabilities, the approximate link steady state distribution (a negative binomial distribution) can be approximated well by the steady state distribution of a birth-death process. <p> Our approach then is to form a Markov decision process based on this birth-death process. In the following, we summarize how a link with multiple classes of traffic can be approximated as a birth-death process using this technique, <ref> [15] </ref>. A discussion of how this approximation can be used to derive a set of simple expressions for computing the state-dependent link shadow prices is then presented in the next section. We describe the state of link ` by the number of busy circuits, i. <p> When in state i, the process has a death rate of i and a birth rate of ~ 2 = 2 + i (1 ~= 2 ), where ~ = P K P K k k . The numerical results in <ref> [15] </ref> show that the blocking probability of the link can be accurately approximated by the steady state distributions of this birth-death process under various traffic conditions, especially under heavy traffic conditions. 3.2 Markov Decision Process with the Simplified Link Model In this section, we derive a set of simple expressions for

Reference-contexts: We first model each link as a birth-death process by applying recent results from Chung and Ross [15]. We then form a Markov decision process based on this birth-death process, using a similar formulation as in the Adaptive State-Dependent Routing scheme (ASDR) in <ref> [16] </ref>. Our approach differs from ASDR by the fact that the concept of call loss in ASDR has been extended to revenue loss in order to consider the case of multiple traffic classes. Four routing policies are studied in this paper. <p> Thus the link shadow prices can be obtained by solving the set of equations (3) once the traffic load offered to each link is known. In [1], the values of the link offered traffic loads correspond to the traffic assignments of the optimal non- alternate routing policy.

In our numerical examples, t is set to twenty time units. 13 4.1 The priority ASDR policy Our ASDR scheme is a modified adaptive version of the SDR scheme proposed in <ref> [16] </ref>. The following is a detailed description of priority ASDR. Call classification: In priority ASDR, calls are classified according to their bandwidth requirements. (For simplicity, we assume that all calls with the same bandwidth requirements have the same mean holding time.

The third policy that we study is similar to the modified MDPD' policy proposed in <ref> [17] </ref>, in which the path cost is taken into account in both the average link shadow price and the state-dependent link shadow price. <p> We assume that there is no additional cost associated with any of the actions of accepting a call, rejecting a call, or completing a call. The performance metric in which we are interested is the fractional reward loss <ref> [14, 17] </ref>, which is defined as the ratio of the loss revenue to the expected offered revenue. <p> If path costs of all candidate paths equal or exceed the call reward, the call is rejected. 4.2 Priority MDPD policy and MDPD' policy The priority MDPD and MDPD' routing policies were introduced and studied in <ref> [17] </ref>. We study simplified versions of these two policies, in which (1) the state-dependent link shadow prices are approximated by the expressions obtained in the previous section, and (2) certain on-line link-measurements are simplified. A detailed description follows. <p> Path cost: The method of computing path costs in priority MDPD is the same as in ASDR. Notice that path net-gain defined in [14] is equivalent to (r k path cost), where path cost is defined in equation (8). Consider now the MDPD' policy. It was demonstrated in <ref> [17] </ref> that priority should not always be given to direct links. Instead, [17] proposes a method of modifying the path net-gain to improve the performance of a routing scheme without giving priority to direct calls. <p> Notice that path net-gain defined in [14] is equivalent to (r k path cost), where path cost is defined in equation (8). Consider now the MDPD' policy. It was demonstrated in <ref> [17] </ref> that priority should not always be given to direct links. Instead, [17] proposes a method of modifying the path net-gain to improve the performance of a routing scheme without giving priority to direct calls. <p> The idea is to increase the probability of choosing paths with a higher derivative of the average network reward with respect to the rate of calls carried on the path. The path cost is thus modified as follows <ref> [17] </ref>: path cost 0 = m X [(1 fi)p k (i n ) + fi p k ]; where p j n k is the average link shadow price measured on-line from the previous policy iteration cycle. Unfortunately, there is no systematic methodology for choosing the optimal value of fi. <p> Unfortunately, there is no systematic methodology for choosing the optimal value of fi. From numerous of the tested cases, the authors of <ref> [17] </ref> have 16 found that the optimal value of fi falls in the interval [0:4; 0:7] and the performance of the MDPD' routing policy is quite insensitive to the value of fi given that fi 2 [0:4; 0:7]. <p> In our numerical examples, we have found that the MDPD' policy yields very good performance by setting fi = 0:3. (Note that the optimal value of fi in our study is different from <ref> [17] </ref> because of several differences in our approach (e.g., link-offered load measures, and the use of the simplified link model).) Path selection: Priority MDPD uses the same method of path selection as priority ASDR. <p> However, the better performance is achieved at an additional computational cost. In <ref> [17, 27] </ref>, an ill-dimensioned network has been used to show that giving priority to shorter paths will degrade the routing performance.

Reference-contexts: These three MDP-based policies are compared to a fourth policy, the least-loaded path routing scheme (LLP) which has been shown to be very effective in past studies <ref> [3, 18] </ref>. The performance of these four routing policies is examined using the NSF T3 backbone network (NSFNET) as the underlying network topology. Our simulation results show that the three Markov decision-based routing policies yield better performance than LLP. <p> MDPD' uses a similar algorithm except that no priority is given to direct links. 4.3 The LLP policy The last policy we study is based on the least-loaded path (LLP) routing algorithm [23]. LLP has been shown to be very efficient <ref> [3, 18] </ref>, particularly when coupled with an appropriate trunk reservation policy [24]. Under LLP with a trunk reservation policy, a call is first offered to the direct link.

Reference-contexts: A rough approximation scheme, which aggregates all traffic classes into one class and assumes the resulting total offered traffic to be Poissonian, is also proposed by Dziong et al. <ref> [19] </ref>. Our approximation scheme also aggregates all traffic classes into one class. However, the cumulative distribution function of the link occupancy of a link with non-Poisson arrivals is approximated by a negative binomial distribution. Thus, 2 our approximation scheme provides more accurate routing information than the scheme from [19] while requiring <p> et al. <ref> [19] </ref>.

However, the cumulative distribution function of the link occupancy of a link with non-Poisson arrivals is approximated by a negative binomial distribution. Thus, 2 our approximation scheme provides more accurate routing information than the scheme from [19] while requiring no additional computation. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we first formulate the routing problem for multirate networks as a Markov decision process. <p> An approximation scheme, which aggregates all traffic classes into one class and assumes the resulting total offered traffic to be Poissonian, is also proposed in <ref> [19] </ref>. The advantage of our approximation scheme is that our scheme provides more accurate link shadow prices than this other scheme while requiring no additional computation. As a result, routing algorithms using our approximation scheme are, in general, able to yield better performance.
