Abstract: This paper is one in a series of studies by members of the "Research in Undergraduate Mathematics Education Community", or RUMEC, concerning the nature and development of college students' mathematical knowledge. The present paper examines how abstract algebra students might come to understand binary operations, groups, and subgroups. We give preliminary theoretical analyses of what it could mean to understand these topics, expressed in terms of the Action-Process-Object epistemological framework. We describe an instructional treatment designed to help foster the formation of mental constructions postulated by the theoretical analysis, and discuss the results of interviews and performance on examinations. These results suggest that our pedagogical approach was reasonably effective in helping students to develop strong conceptions of binary operations, groups, and subgroups. Based on the data collected as part of this study, we propose revised epistemological analyses of these topics, and give some pedagogical suggestions related to these topics.

Reference-contexts: Our framework for conducting research has three components: an initial theoretical analysis, an instructional treatment, and empirical data. We will begin by describing our approach briefly; the reader is referred to Asiala, et. al. <ref> [1] </ref> for a complete discussion of each of the three components. The first step is to make an initial theoretical analysis of the epistemology of the concept of interest.

Reference-contexts: The responses of the students to the questions about the binary operation in D 4 are related to both their understanding of binary operation in general and their understanding of symmetries of the square. There is a focus on the latter in another report (see <ref> [2] </ref>), but the two cannot be completely separated since a student's difficulty with understanding a symmetry as an object or process will affect her or his response to these questions about the binary operation in D 4 .

Reference-contexts: We interpret the students' difficulties in coordinating these notions to indicate that an individual's subset schema may be adequate to assimilate a newly defined subset in some cases, but it may not be adequate in other cases. It has been noted (see [30] and <ref> [3] </ref>) that this is true of functions, that is, that the way in which a particular function is defined has an effect on the way in which the concept develops in a student's mind.

Reference-contexts: strand, we will consider the center separately from the other schemas. 3.1 Binary operation The essence of our initial theoretical analysis is that a binary operation is a function (of two variables), and hence our genetic decomposition will be very close to a genetic decomposition for the function concept. (See <ref> [6] </ref>.) Following is a description of various conceptions of binary operation in terms of the APOS framework. Action. The student can perform a binary operation only when given an explicit formula as in modular arithmetic. Process.

Reference-contexts: The results of these experiments give information about the students' abilities to deal with the specific examples, but do not address the learning of the underlying conceptual mathematics. Still other studies exist (for instance, [16], [23] and <ref> [7] </ref>) in which the mathematical understandings of very young children are identified and described as being instances of advanced concepts such as binary operation, group, or subgroup. <p> Such studies frequently attribute to the children 3 a deep understanding of the underlying mathematical concept on the basis of the observed use of a concrete example. (See, for example, the comment by Burn <ref> [7] </ref> who asserts that quotient groups are not difficult because the additive properties of even and odd "provides a description of a quotient group of the integers which is familiar to many school children.") Recently, a few studies have been done which investigate the ways in which students learn these concepts

Reference-contexts: The interviews were conducted by people known to be connected with the experimental course. Finally, some potential interviewees from standard courses declined to 49 participate because of an expressed strong dislike for the subject matter (see Clark et. al. <ref> [8] </ref> for a fuller discussion of this issue). Therefore, we will only summarize the comparative data very briefly. All of the data comes from the Second Interview, Questions 4 and 5. We identified several performance indicators in the data, and categorized them as either "successful" or "unsuccessful".

Hart rated it as the second most difficult of the six proofs of standard results from elementary group theory that were part of this study. It is difficult to make a meaningful comparison of our more positive results with his because the situations were quite different.

Reference-contexts: make some sense out of the situation, a student would try to use Lagrange's theorem inappropriately (for example, suggesting that since 6 divided the order of the group, the group must have an element of order 6, a type of response that has been discussed by Hazzan and Leron in <ref> [18] </ref>).
