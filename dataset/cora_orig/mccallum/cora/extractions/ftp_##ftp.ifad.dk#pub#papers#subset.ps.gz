Abstract: In this article we present the executable specification language IPTES Meta-IV based on the formal specification language VDM-SL. The language has been fitted to work in an SA/RT framework and the article presents how it supports the specification of the data transformation part of SA/RT. Furthermore we present some of the advanced constructs of the language seen as an executable specification language in its own right. Finally we present how an IPTES Meta-IV interpreter is used in combination with a high-level timed Petri net executor to execute SA/RT models.

Reference-contexts: SOKRATES [Auer&90] [Okkonen&89] is also based on the SA/RT notation and it supports code generation at all stages of a design. Instead of simulating a specification at the SA/RT level, the user has to execute the generated code. In SOKRATES the data transformations are specified in Ada. Design/CPN <ref> [Albert&89] </ref> is a tool package supporting the specification of systems by the use of colored Petri nets.
