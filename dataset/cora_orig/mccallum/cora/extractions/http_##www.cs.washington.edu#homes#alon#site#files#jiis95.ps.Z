Abstract: Global information systems involve a large number of information sources distributed over computer networks. The variety of information sources and disparity of interfaces makes the task of easily locating and efficiently accessing information over the network very cumbersome. We describe an architecture for global information systems that is especially tailored to address the challenges raised in such an environment, and distinguish our architecture from architectures of multidatabase and distributed database systems. Our architecture is based on presenting a conceptually unified view of the information space to a user, specifying rich descriptions of the contents of the information sources, and using these descriptions for optimizing queries posed in the unified view. The contributions of this paper include: (1) we identify aspects of site descriptions that are useful in query optimization; (2) we describe query optimization techniques that minimize the number of information sources accessed; and (3) we demonstrate the need for interleaving planning and query execution in such a system, and present an algorithm for this purpose.

Reference-contexts: Related Work Currently, the only true global information systems available are browsers such as Mosaic <ref> (Andreesen & Bina, 1994) </ref> and its descendents. These systems have taken an important step of hiding from the user the specific protocols associated with contacting each information source.

Reference-contexts: Our architecture bears similarities to other systems, such as Carnot (Collet et al., 1991) and SIMS <ref> (Arens et al., 1994) </ref>, which have a similar goal of logically integrating multiple information sources. Our novel contributions are: 1. <p> Hence, our query optimization techniques are directly applicable to the opti mization of multidatabase queries involving views. Several systems have recently been built to integrate multiple heterogeneous information sources (Genesereth, 1992), <ref> (Arens et al., 1994) </ref>, (Chawathe et al., 1994) and (Subrahmanian et al., 1995). In contrast to others, the focus of our work has been on the language for describing information sources and on the algorithms for selecting sources relevant to a query, using the descriptions. <p> In contrast to others, the focus of our work has been on the language for describing information sources and on the algorithms for selecting sources relevant to a query, using the descriptions. The work most closely related to ours is the SIMS project for integrating multiple information sources <ref> (Arens et al., 1994) </ref>. The representation of the world-view in their system is based on the description logic system LOOM (MacGregor, 1987). The first difference between our works is the data model we consider.

Reference-contexts: Using Classic in the World-View An interesting aspect of our approach is the use of the Classic knowledge representation language as part of our data model. Classic is a member of a family of description logic systems (see <ref> (Borgida, 1992) </ref> for a survey). There are several advantages to using a description logic system as part of the world-view component of a global information system. The key advantage is their ability to support extensibility and modifiability of the world-view.

Reference-contexts: Our world-view is expressed in an object-relational data model that is an expressive combination of the relational model with an object-oriented model (using Classic <ref> (Borgida et al., 1989) </ref>, (Brachman et al., 1991)).

Reference-contexts: For order constraints, implication reasoning can be done in polynomial-time (see (Ullman, 1989)). Subsumption reasoning in Classic can also be done in polynomial-time (see <ref> (Borgida & Patel-Schneider, 1994) </ref>). Example 2 Consider the airline flight application of Example 1.

Reference-contexts: The above algorithm determines that using either of these site relations suffices. 2 4.3. Using Sources Described as Views Using site descriptions of the form (4) and (5) is equivalent to the problem of how to solve a query using materialized views, addressed in <ref> (Chaudhuri et al., 1995) </ref>, (Levy et al., 1995). In (Levy et al., 1995), it is shown that, in general, the problem of finding how to use views to answer a query is NP-complete; however a polynomial time algorithm that covers many common cases is also presented. 17 5.

Specifying Contents of Information Sources The contents of external site relations R are specified by relating them to the world-view relations W = D [ E, using a language that allows expressions of several forms which we describe below.

Reference-contexts: However, this limitation does not impact on the use of Classic in our world-view, since the world-view relations are not explicitly stored; information is explicitly stored only in the external information sources. 2.3. The Query Language Many languages have been proposed for querying object-relational databases (e.g., <ref> (Kifer et al., 1992) </ref>, (Srivastava et al., 1993)). Our world-view is object-relational in nature, synthesizing the relational model with an object-oriented model. Hence, 9 any query language proposed for object-relational databases can be used to query our world-view.

Reference-contexts: If all site descriptions are of the forms (1), (2), or (3), executing the plan is also guaranteed to generate all possible answers to the query, i.e., our algorithm is also complete.

Reference-contexts: Determining Relevant Information Sources We begin by describing how to use information sources that are described using expressions of the form (1) and (2).

Reference-contexts: Note that both object-oriented databases and less structured databases (e.g., structured text databases) can be viewed as answering such queries as well. It should be emphasized that although some of the issues that we discuss have arisen in research on multidatabase systems (see <ref> (Litwin et al., 1990) </ref> for a survey), our solutions differ in significant ways. Most notably, the expressiveness of the site descriptions and the versatility of the query processing algorithms enable a system based on our architecture to naturally accommodate a large number of information sources. <p> Running Example We use the following example to illustrate the various ideas presented in the paper. Example 1 There are currently many systems providing access to large collections of databases (see <ref> (Litwin et al., 1990) </ref> for a description of such systems, for example, the French videotex database system TELETEL). <p> selection operator and denotes the projection operator of relational algebra. 11 Intuitively, expressions of type (1) tell us how fragments of world-view relations can be computed from the site relations, i.e., the world-view relation fragments are akin to traditional views on the site relations and external database schemas in multidatabases <ref> (Litwin et al., 1990) </ref>.

We allow a more expressive data model that allows arbitrary n-ary relations, as well as concepts and roles defined in the description logic Classic.

Reference-contexts: In principle, our world-view allows constraints to be expressed using any domain where we can efficiently determine whether one constraint implies (i.e., is subsumed by) another constraint. For order constraints, implication reasoning can be done in polynomial-time (see <ref> (Ullman, 1989) </ref>). Subsumption reasoning in Classic can also be done in polynomial-time (see (Borgida & Patel-Schneider, 1994)). Example 2 Consider the airline flight application of Example 1. <p> just 212) can be used to restrict the set of relevant directory information sources to only those that have telephone listings in the 212 area code. 2 Using the bindings obtained from one subgoal to optimize the evaluation of a subsequent subgoal is the key idea behind sideways information passing <ref> (Ullman, 1989) </ref>. The main difference between our usage of sideways information passing here and the traditional usage is that the bindings are actually used to refine the plans for the subsequent subgoals, and not simply in order to exploit indices on database relations.

Reference-contexts: Classic stands out in this family as a language that has been carefully designed so that subsump-tion reasoning is in polynomial-time, while still being expressive, and which has been used in large-scale commercial applications (e.g., <ref> (Wright et al., 1993) </ref>). Finally, the most significant limitation of description logic systems is that their scale-up suffers in the presence of large collections of objects.
