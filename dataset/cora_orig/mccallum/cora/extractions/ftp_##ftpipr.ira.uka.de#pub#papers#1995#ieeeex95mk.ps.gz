Abstract: This paper presents an integrated approach to the application of Machine Learning techniques for the enhancement of mobile robots' skills. It identifies the learning tasks that can be observed throughout a number of typical applications of mobile robots and puts those tasks into perspective with respect to both existing and newly developed learning techniques. The actual realization of the approach has been carried out on the two mobile robots PRIAMOS and TESEO, which are both operating in a real office environment. In this context, several experimental results are presented.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, it is desirable to have the robot learn this realization, starting from some description of what it is expected to do. One possibility to learn this realization is to follow the line of reinforcement learning <ref> [Barto et al., 1983, Williams, 1992] </ref>. The robot then has to learn suitable reactions directly from a feedback signal, which, in the simplest case, is positive as soon as the robot achieves the goal (e.g., it passes the door), and is negative otherwise. <p> To solve this task, two different learning rules, namely temporal difference (TD) methods [Sutton, 1988] and associative search (AS) <ref> [Barto et al., 1983, Williams, 1992] </ref> are used, where TD methods are employed to predict the total future reward and AS is used to update the situation-action mapping based on the estimation given by TD.

Reference-contexts: Basically, learning an elementary operation from examples requires to approximate a function mapping the sensorial input to robot motions. The task of function approximation is usually related to methods such as neural networks [Miller et al., 1990], regression trees <ref> [Breiman et al., 1984] </ref>, or the generation of fuzzy rules [Wang & Mendel, 1992]. These methods, however, do in general not yield a result that is easily understandable for a human user.

Reference-contexts: As the efforts made in the acquisition phase pay only off if the edge detection algorithm is setup appropriately, neural regulation is also employed to parameterize the Canny algorithm <ref> [Canny, 1986] </ref> used for the edge extraction. The Canny algorithm is mainly a hysteresis threshold done on the gradient magnitude of the image.

Reference-contexts: This localization task has been extensively studied (see, for instance, <ref> [Crowley, 1989, Leonard & Durrant-Whyte, 1992] </ref>), and good solutions exist.

Reference-contexts: These objects must be linked to the map holding the geometrical information about the world. The generated descriptions are necessarily operational, since they are directly derived from the basic features which are calculated from the sensorial input. The main difference to earlier classification approaches like <ref> [DeJong & Mooney, 1986] </ref> is the fact that operational concepts do not only use perceptions to classify the object. They also relate these perceptions to the actions that are performed by the robot.

Reference-contexts: This general task results in two basic requirements. The first is the availability of one or more sensor systems that are capable to perceive environmental information <ref> [Elfes, 1987] </ref>. To ensure collision-free motion, mobile robots are usually equipped with a set of distance-measuring sensors based on laser, ultrasound, or infrared (see also figure 1). The information provided by these sensors can be processed quickly, hence they are ideally suitable for continuously monitoring the environment in real-time.

Reference-contexts: The procedure used to generate and refine a map of the environment on the base of sonar and infrared measurements extends two approaches that can be found in the literature. Firstly, sonar measurements are collected in occupancy grids <ref> [Elfes, 1989] </ref> that are local with repect to the actual area of perception (see figure 3).

Reference-contexts: These schemata, which represent situation-action rules on the highest level of abstraction, capture the correspondance between specific locations, non-geometrical parameters of the world, and elementary operations. In the machine learning community, learning schemata is an application domain of deductive approaches such as EBL or EBG (see <ref> [Ellman, 1989] </ref> for an overview). Based on background knowledge, these methods transform a particular problem solution into a schema (a macro) or extract heuristics (meta-knowledge) for problem solving. The main difference of the approach presented here is the use of a single entity, the topological graph, to represent all schemata.

Reference-contexts: In that respect, what is required is a multi-strategy approach, which looks as follows: 1. On the base of the geometrical world model, generate the topological graph, e.g., by employing Voronoi diagrams (see <ref> [Hwang & Ahuja, 1992] </ref> for an overview on motion planning algorithms). 2. Label each edge with the local geometrical planning with collision avoidance EO. 3. Additionally, initialize the costs of each edge to be the geometrical length of that edge. 4.

Reference-contexts: They also relate these perceptions to the actions that are performed by the robot. To solve this learning task, inductive learning in restricted first order logic <ref> [Kietz & Wrobel, 1992] </ref> is employed. This learning method yields concept descriptions like stable (s 1 ,t 1 ,t 2 ) & incr peak (s 1 ,t 2 ,t 3 ) & stable (s 1 ,t 3 ,t 4 ) ! s jump (s 1 ,t 1 ,t 4 ). <p> To generate these examples, direct teaching of the robot can be used as well as simulation. The applied learning algorithm, GRDT, is able to syntactically restrict the hypothesis space, i.e., the space of learnable rules, by learning instantiations of user-given rule schemata <ref> [Kietz & Wrobel, 1992] </ref>. In addition to the examples, background knowledge like information about sensor configurations was given. GRDT starts with the most general hypothesis and specializes it until the given positive and negative examples are sufficiently well described. structured concepts (right).

Reference-contexts: Secondly, as soon as a sufficient degree of safety with respect to the integrated measurements has been achieved, a parametric description of the measured object is generated (see also, for example, <ref> [Leonard & Durrant-Whyte, 1992] </ref>). More specifically, as every object in the environment is represented by a set of interconnected line segments, generating a parametric description from a certainty grid means to estimate the parameters describing each segment (orientation, distance to the origin) from that grid. <p> This localization task has been extensively studied (see, for instance, <ref> [Crowley, 1989, Leonard & Durrant-Whyte, 1992] </ref>), and good solutions exist.

Reference-contexts: Based on a quality evaluation of acquired images, the camera parameters (focus, camera aperture, electronic gain, and black level) are adapted until an acceptable image quality has been obtained. The actual adaptation strategy can be represented in several ways, e.g., as rules <ref> [Ooi et al., 1990] </ref> or in terms of neural networks that have been trained using a set of a-priori acquired images and the corresponding, manually set camera parameters.

Reference-contexts: Basically, learning an elementary operation from examples requires to approximate a function mapping the sensorial input to robot motions. The task of function approximation is usually related to methods such as neural networks [Miller et al., 1990], regression trees [Breiman et al., 1984], or the generation of fuzzy rules <ref> [Wang & Mendel, 1992] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Concepts that cannot be described based by means of existing features cannot be described either with newly built intermediate concepts, since such concepts only simplify the representation, but they do not enlarge the "closure of existing symbols" <ref> [Wrobel, 1991] </ref>. Therefore, the parametric descriptions obtained from integrating distance measurements are not suitable for learning operational concepts, as they describe situations with respect to the world and not as the robot itself perceives them.
