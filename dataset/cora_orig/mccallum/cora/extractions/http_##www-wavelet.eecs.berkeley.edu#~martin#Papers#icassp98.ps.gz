Title: HIGH ORDER BALANCED MULTIWAVELETS  
Author: Jerome Lebrun and Martin Vetterli 
Affiliation: Dept. of Electrical Engineering Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne  
Abstract: In this paper, we study the issue of regularity for multi-wavelets. We generalize here the concept of balancing for higher degree discrete-time polynomial signals and link it to a very natural factorization of the lowpass refinement mask that is the counterpart of the well-known zeros at condition for wavelets. This enables us to clarify the subtle relations between approximation power, smoothness and balancing order. Using these new results, we are also able to construct a family of orthogonal multiwavelets with symmetries and compact support that is indexed by the order of balancing. More details (filters coefficients, drawings of the whole family, frequency responses,...) can be obtained on the [WEB] at http://lcavwww.epfl.ch/~lebrun

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, we will assume that the sequences fM [k]g k and fN [k]g k are finite and thus that (t) and (t) have compact support. We then recall some result obtained in <ref> [1] </ref> about the convergence of the iterated matrix product M 1 (!). <p> One expect then some class of smooth signals to be preserved by the lowpass branch and cancelled by the highpass. 3.1. Balancing We define the band-Toeplitz matrix corresponding to the lowpass analysis L := 6 ::: M [0] M <ref> [1] </ref> M [2] M [3] ::: ::: 7 and in the same way, we define H the band-Toeplitz matrix corresponding to the highpass analysis. <p> Now, we can state Theorem 3.1 The following conditions are equivalent B0: L &gt; u 1 = u 1 .

B3: y m 0 (z)+m 1 (z) has zeros on the unit circle at j; 1; j. <p> Now, we can state Theorem 3.1 The following conditions are equivalent B0: L &gt; u 1 = u 1 . B1: <ref> [1; 1] </ref> is a left eigenvector of M (1) for 0 (1) = 1. B2: (0) = [1; 1] &gt; . B3: y m 0 (z)+m 1 (z) has zeros on the unit circle at j; 1; j. B4: One can factorize M (z) = 1 2 T (z 2 )M 0 (z)T 1 (z) with T (z) := 1 1 1 = 1 Proof. <p> (z) : : : C 0 (z) with C n (z) := n a 1 z 1 b 1 n and the FIR refinement mask M p1 (z) verifying M p1 (1)r p1 = r p1 where r &gt; n := [a n ; b n ] = 2 n <ref> [1; 1] </ref> obtained recursively from y n for n = 0; : : : ; p 1. Thus C n (z) = 2 n T (z) and M p1 (1)[1; 1] &gt; = [1; 1] &gt; . [B4 p )B3 p ]: This is proved by induction on p [WEB]. <p> = r p1 where r &gt; n := [a n ; b n ] = 2 n <ref> [1; 1] </ref> obtained recursively from y n for n = 0; : : : ; p 1.

The case p = 1 is a consequence of Theorem 3.1.

Reference-contexts: So, from the rank M wavelets theory (Theorem 2.1. in <ref> [4] </ref>), we get that this system preserves discrete polynomial sequences of degree n = 0; : : : ; p1, and since this multirate system is equivalent to the lowpass synthesis branch for polynomial sequences of degree up to p 1, this translates in time domain into condition B0 p .
