Abstract: We study the two-level uncapacitated facility location (TUFL) problem. Given two types of facilities, which we call y-facilities and z-facilities, the problem is to decide which facilities of both types to open, and to which pair of y- and z-facilities each client should be assigned, in order to satisfy the demand at maximum profit. We first present two multi-commodity flow formulations of TUFL and investigate the relationship between these formulations and similar formulations of the one-level uncapacitated facility location (UFL) problem. In particular, we show that all nontrivial facets for UFL define facets for the two-level problem, and derive conditions when facets of TUFL are also facets for UFL. For both formulations of TUFL, we introduce new families of facets and valid inequalities and discuss the associated separation problems. We also characterize the extreme points of the LP-relaxation of the first formulation. While the LP-relaxation of a multi-commodity formulation provides good bounds in general, the number of variables and constraints grows rapidly with the size of the problem instance. An alternative model of TUFL is a single-commodity fixed-charge network flow problem. Rardin and Wolsey showed that by projecting a so-called multi-commodity extended formulation of fixed-charge network flow problems onto the space of flow variables used in the weaker flow formulation, a broad class of valid inequalities can be obtained. We discuss a subclass of these inequalities for TUFL that seems particularly useful for computational purposes.

Reference-contexts: As before, we assume that n and q are both at least equal to 2. Let P UFL = conv (X UFL ). Proposition 4 <ref> (Cornuejols, Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1990) </ref> The dimension of P UFL is nq + n q. Below we show that all nontrivial facets of UFL are also facets for P MC , thus providing us with a large collection of facets for TUFL. <p> Each row of this submatrix corresponds to a point in X UFL on the facet defined by (9). 9 Since the inequalities x jk y j for all j 2 J; k 2 K; are facet-defining for P UFL <ref> (See Cornuejols, Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1990) </ref>, applying Theorem 5 proves parts (a) and (d) of Proposition 2.

Reference-contexts: We note that when jI 0 j = q 1 and when jJ 0 j = q 1, the inequalities (21) and (26) are Chvatal-Gomory inequalities of rank 1 <ref> (see Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1988) </ref>. 18 3.2.3 Separation The separation problems based on the families of inequalities (21) and (26) are quadratic knapsack problems. However, for fixed size of the subsets jI 0 j and jJ 0 j respectively, we obtain linear 0-1 knapsack problems.

Reference-contexts: Computational experiments have shown that the linear programming bound produced by formulation MC in general is very sharp <ref> (see Rardin and Choe, 1979) </ref>. However, the formulation grows rapidly with the size of the instance. Therefore, we introduce in the following subsection a weaker flow formulation, as an alternative to the multi-commodity formulation MC.

Reference-contexts: However, the formulation grows rapidly with the size of the instance. Therefore, we introduce in the following subsection a weaker flow formulation, as an alternative to the multi-commodity formulation MC. In Section 5.2 we discuss how the flow formulation can be strengthened by adding dicut collection inequalities <ref> (see Rardin and Wolsey, 1993) </ref>. 20 5.1 The Single-Commodity Flow Formulation Let w ij be the quantity sent from z-facility i to y-facility j and v jk the quantity sent from y-facility j to client k. Note that v jk = P P k2K x ijk .

Reference-contexts: The structure of the digraph relevant to TUFL is shown in Figure 2. One subclass of the simple dicut collection inequalities that seems particularly useful for formulation F of TUFL is the so-called fixed-charge path inequalities <ref> (see Van Roy and Wolsey, 1987) </ref>. These inequalities involve variables for both z- and y-facilities as well as clients. Consider the path ( ~ i; ~ j; ~ k) from z-facility ~ i, through y-facility ~ j to client ~ k.
