Reference-contexts: acceptable state by a compensating mechanism (if requested by the user). 2.1 Requirements for the data model The data model for workflow systems has not yet been discussed in the literature, though it is an accepted fact that there are special requirements for a data model which supports long-running processes <ref> [2] </ref>. We believe the following are among the requirements for workflow systems: * Users are very interested in examining the history of workflows.

Reference-contexts: Another group of proposals took a much more pragmatic perspective by defining extra functions in existing TP-monitors that allow to chain two subsequent transaction programs, for example. Some database systems support chain transactions, there are mini batches <ref> [3] </ref>, and a number of other ideas to try and work around the problem.

Reference-contexts: Therefore a new correctness criterion has been introduced which allows parallelism far beyond serializability. Furthermore, the design allows us to handle conflicts explicitly instead of reacting to a conflict by simply aborting the current transaction. Although the prototypical implementation of a ConTract system (APRICOTS) <ref> [5] </ref> has been under development for more than three years now, not all features have been completely implemented yet. We are currently working on the efficient implementation of the concurrency control concepts.
