Abstract: The so called weak form of the Hilbert's Nullstellensatz says that a system of algebraic equations over a field, Q i (x) = 0, does not have a solution in the algebraic closure iff 1 is in the ideal generated by the polynomials Q i (x). We shall prove a lower bound on the degrees of polynomials P i (x) such that P This result has the following application. The modular counting principle states that no finite set whose cardinality is not divisible by q can be partitioned into q-element classes. For each fixed cardinality N , this principle can be expressed as a propositional formula Count N p , m 6 0 (mod p). We give a new proof of this theorem based on the lower bound for the Hilbert's Nullstellensatz. Furthermore our technique enables us to extend the independence results for counting principles to composite numbers p and q. This improved lower bound together with new upper bounds yield an exact characterization of when Count q can be proven efficiently from Count p , for all values of p and q.

Reference-contexts: The corresponding propositional proof systems are constant-depth Frege systems. The first strong lower bound for a natural proof system was obtained by Haken [11] who proved an exponential lower bound to the resolution proofs of the pigeonhole principle (P HP ). Then Ajtai <ref> [1] </ref> showed that constant-depth Frege systems (which are stronger than resolution) do not admit polynomial size proofs of P HP . The first exponential lower bound for such systems was obtained in [14] (for different formulas), followed by an exponential lower bound for P HP established in [6, 16, 18].

Reference-contexts: Constant-depth Frege systems are the strongest proof systems for which a non-trivial lower bound is known. The problem of proving superpolynomial lower bounds for a general Frege system appears to be analogous to important open problems in complexity theory (e.g. whether N P = N C 1 ). In <ref> [2] </ref> Ajtai showed that there are no polynomial size constant-depth Frege proofs of Count 2 (the propositional mod 2 counting principle) from the pigeonhole principle. (We use the notation Count q for the generic version of Count m q where m 6 0 (mod q).) This was subsequently improved to an

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [3] </ref> Ajtai studied the relation of principles Count p and Count q , which had been considered earlier in [17]. For example, assume that qjp and that R is a q-partition of N . <p> Moreover, if q does not divide N then p does not divide N 0 . This demonstrates that Count q follows from a simple instance of Count p if qjp; more precisely, there are polynomial size, constant-depth Frege proofs of Count q from Count p . Ajtai <ref> [3] </ref> showed that if p; q are different primes then Count q does not admit polynomial size, constant-depth Frege proofs from instances of Count p . <p> We see the main contribution of the paper in the new method. In particular, by proving a better lower bound for the Nullstellensatz our method would yield a better lower bound on proofs while the method of <ref> [3] </ref> (its boolean complexity part) inherently can give only the non-existence of polynomial upper bounds. See the last section for more discussion on this topic. The paper is organized as follows. <p> In the second section we give a number of upper bound constructions relating the provability of different modular counting axioms. The third section is devoted to the first part of the lower bound proof, reducing the lower bound to a combinatorial problem. Relevant notions from 1 Ajtai's paper <ref> [3] </ref> became available in Summer 1993. In Spring 1993 Riis [20] announced a solution of the problem of the independence of the counting principles which was based on a partial solution of the combinatorial problem from [19]. <p> The bound on the degree of polynomials in the Nullstellensatz is proved in the fifth section. In the sixth section we define the extensions of constant-depth Frege systems by modular counting gates and we conclude with several remarks on the relation of our method to those of <ref> [3, 19] </ref>. <p> Problem Assume s; r 2 and assume r does not divide s. Are there polynomial size, constant-depth Frege proofs of Count r from instances of formulas in Count s ? If so, under what circumstances do they exist? This was solved in the negative by Ajtai <ref> [3] </ref> for the case when r; s are two different primes. We give a new proof of a strengthened version of his theorem that gives a complete characterization of this problem. Let symbol (a; b) denote the greatest common divisor of a and b. <p> By assumption s also divides p. Thus for j = p=s all prime factors of p (p;j) also divide q (q;N) and applying Theorem 1.2 we are done. q.e.d. For example, the following case is covered by Corollary 1.3 but not by <ref> [3] </ref>: p = 6; q = 5. 2 Upper bounds for proofs of counting princi- <p>- ples The bulk of our arguments are concerned with our extension of Ajtai's lower bounds but we deal with the upper bounds first. We begin by observing some straightforward relationships between the principles. <p> It is interesting to compare the methods used in this paper and those of Ajtai <ref> [3, 4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The interest in lower bounds on the complexity of propositional proof systems stems from two sources. First, any complete and sound proof system can 2 be thought of as a non-deterministic acceptor of the set of propositional tautolo- <p>- gies. In fact, <ref> [10] </ref> define propositional proof systems to be just non-deterministic acceptors of the set of propositional tautologies. <p> A Frege system is a sound and implicationally complete proof system having a finite number of axiom schemes and inference rules. A typical Frege system is the usual calculus based on a finite number of axioms with modus ponens as the only rule of inference. See <ref> [10] </ref> for details. The size of a proof in a Frege system is the number of distinct subformulas appearing in the proof where we do not distinguish F and :F .

Reference-contexts: The third section is devoted to the first part of the lower bound proof, reducing the lower bound to a combinatorial problem. Relevant notions from 1 Ajtai's paper [3] became available in Summer 1993. In Spring 1993 Riis <ref> [20] </ref> announced a solution of the problem of the independence of the counting principles which was based on a partial solution of the combinatorial problem from [19]. However, the manuscript contained serious gaps as well as did some later versions available in Summer and Fall of 1993. <p> In particular, this last version uses Ramsey theorem not used in the previous versions, and adds several upper bounds also not stated in the earlier versions. A Ramsey-type argument was first employed in our paper (available in Spring 1994). The exact upper bounds occurred here also prior to <ref> [20] </ref>; [19] offered some upper bounds in the context of the pigeonhole principle. 4 [6, 16, 18] are recalled there and the main theorem is proved from a combinatorial lemma.
