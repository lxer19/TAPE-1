Title: Multiple Recognizer Combination Topologies

Abstract: Handwriting combination can benefit from combining results obtained from different recognizers. Most often such multiple recognizers are used independently, without interacting with each other. This paper presents a different approach to results combination. Individual recognizers interact with each other, inuencing each others results. Three combination topologies are presented: conditional, hierarchical and hybrid. Experimental results are presented and compared with results of a more traditional approach.

Reference-contexts: This however results in lesser reduction of the lexicon size and potentially lesser improvement of the performance of the second recognizer. Therefore a trade-off between increasing the chances of discarding the correct alternative and improving the performance of the consequent recognizer by limiting its lexicon may be beneficial <ref> (e.g. Madhvanath & Govindaraju, 1995) </ref>. Table 4. Recognition rates [%] for the recognizers developed by the authors, taking into consideration various number of word alternatives. <p> When deciding the size of the reduced lexicon low rate of rejections of correct word alternatives was given the priority over minimizing the lexicon size. An opposite approach is also possible and reported in the literature <ref> (Madhvanath & Govindaraju, 1995) </ref>. Madhvanath and Govindaraju report recognition rate improvements when the reduced lexicon is five or ten words only. Results obtained by the authors do not follow this trend (see Table 7).

Reference-contexts: The results could be different if the subsequent recognizer used by the authors matched the characteristic of the CMR. The hybrid combination topology is very close to the idea of the recognition toolbox promoted by the authors <ref> (Powalka, Sherkat, & Whitrow, 1993b) </ref>. It chooses the recognizer better suited for particular data. The topology is capable of significant reduction in recognition time (SEG_VB and SEG_ADLV), however it provides recognition rates lower than the multiple topology.

They reach 96.4% and 96.8% for 250 word alternatives, respectively. The AD and ADLV recognizers cannot exceed the accuracy of the zoning extraction process <ref> (Powalka et al., 1994b) </ref>, which is around 80% for the data used in the reported experiments. The SEG recognizer provides good results disambiguation capability. The correct word is nearly always within the top ten alternatives, or it is not recognized at all.

Therefore the limitation of the AD recognizer is removed in this case. The information in the middle zone is also used. All vertical bars are matched, including those in the middle zone. <p> The disparity between the number of segmentation based and wholistic recognizers stems from the progression of the authors research interests. The SEG recognizer was developed first. Its limitations led to work on the AD recognizer, which in turn led to the VB. Applying the letter verification <ref> (see Powalka et al., 1995a) </ref> to the AD and VB resulted in the ADLV and VBLV recognizers. 3. Combination topologies Observing results of individual recognizers suggests some combination topologies alternative to running the recognizers independently. Firstly, it is possible for some of the recognizers to succeed where others fail. <p> A number of handwriting characteristics have been analysed (Powalka et al., 1995b). Word length has been found to be the most useful criterion. In order to avoid errors in word length estimation, the number of vertical bars <ref> (see Powalka et al., 1995a) </ref> identified within the word is used to represent the word length. This feature is relatively simple to extract and is already available to the authors. recognition results. The continuous line in Figure 5 with no points marked represents the distribution of the handwriting data.

Reference-contexts: The difference however is that in this case the decision about the use of results of individual recognizers is made after all of them have completed the recognition. 3.3. Hybrid It has been observed that various recognition approaches work better for particular types of handwriting <ref> (Powalka, Sherkat, & Whitrow, 1995b) </ref>. This information could be used to decide which recognizer to run in a multi-recognizer system. The effect is the hybrid combination topology depicted in Figure 4. The ink data is passed to the handwriting analysis process, which determines which recognizer to run: R1 or R2. <p> R2 Ink data R1 results Results Lexicon 1 Lexicon 2 R1 Multiple Recognizer Combination Topologies The choice of the recognizer is made based on characteristics of the handwriting data being processed.
