Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION It is well known that the d-separation test is sound and complete relative to the independencies assumed in the construction of Bayesian networks <ref> [Verma and Pearl, 1988, Geiger et al., 1990] </ref>. In other words, any d-separation condition in the network corresponds to a genuine independence condition in the underlying probability distribution and, conversely, every d-connection corresponds to a dependency in at least one distribution compatible with the network. <p> To distinguish between the graphical notion of d-separation, (X k Y jZ) G , and the probabilistic notion of conditional independence, we will use the notation (X ? Y jZ) P for the latter. The connection between the two is given in Theorem 1. Theorem 1 <ref> [Verma and Pearl, 1988, Geiger et al., 1990] </ref> For any three disjoint subsets of nodes (X; Y; Z) in a DAG G, and for all probability functions P , we have (i) (X k Y jZ) G =) (X ?

Reference-contexts: purpose of this paper is to show that those independencies nevertheless can be read off the causal graph using the d-separation test, provided two conditions are satisfied: (1) Eq. (6) holds, and (2) the variables in V are discrete. 2 Definition 3 is a generalization of "structural equations" in econometrics <ref> [Goldberger, 1972] </ref>, where continuous variables are normally assumed, and where the analysis is generally confined to linear systems with Gaussian noise. <p> In the literature on path analysis [Wright, 1921] and structural equation models <ref> [Goldberger, 1972] </ref>, it is common to designate these dummy nodes by curved, bidirected arcs connecting two disturbances. They represent unobserved common factors that the mod eler has decided to keep outside the analysis.

Reference-contexts: For any disjoint sets of nodes X; Y and Z of G we have (X k fl Y jZ) G XY Z () (G k Y jZ) G (16) Proof: Lemma 3 merely generalizes Eq. (3) to the case of cyclic graphs. Tracing the proof of Proposition 3 in <ref> [Lauritzen et al., 1990] </ref>, we find that each step in the proof remains valid for cyclic graphs as well. Indeed, a "moralizing" edge is still added between two nodes, a and b, only if a and b share some descendant in Z.

Reference-contexts: The result is a DAG, called a Bayesian network <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref>, in which an arrow from X i to X j assigns X i as a Markovian parent of X j , consistent with Definition 1. <p> A convenient way of characterizing the set of distributions compatible with a DAG G is to list the set of (conditional) independencies that each such distribution must satisfy. These independencies can be read off the DAG by using a graphical criterion called d-separation <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref>. To test whether X is independent of Y given Z in the distributions represented by G, we need to examine G and test whether the nodes corresponding to variables Z d-separate all paths from nodes in X to nodes in Y . <p> (y; z) Proof: Let S 1 be a subset of the variables including X and Z, and S 2 a subset including Y and Z such that V = S 1 [ S 2 . (That V can always be represented this way follows from the transitivity of undirected graphs <ref> [Pearl, 1988, Eq. (3.10e), p. 94] </ref>; every node outside X [ Y [ Z must be separated by Z from either X or Y (or both).) Denote by n i (x) the number of solutions in the set of all solutions projected on S i ; i = 1; 2. <p> to prove that (X k fl Y jZ) G W =) (X ? Y jZ) P T (20) The probabilistic independency on the r.h.s. of Eq. (20) amounts to the equality P T (z)P T (x; y; z) = P T (x; z)P T (y; z) (21) (see, for example, <ref> [Pearl, 1988, page 83] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Our finding should have direct application in the diagnosis of digital cir cuits and in programs that learn the structure of feedback systems <ref> [Richardson, 1996] </ref>. Spirtes (1994) has demonstrated, by a counterexample, that nonlinear continuous systems might violate the d-separation criterion when feedback is introduced. The results established in this paper mean that in continuous systems for which discrete-variable simulation gives a reasonable approximation, the impact of such violations is not too severe.
