Reference-contexts: Such pairs allow for analyzing spectral strength independent of phase, and allow for synthesizing filters of a given frequency response with arbitrary phase. They have application in motion, texture, and orientation analysis <ref> [1, 3, 11, 17, 19, 31, 38] </ref>.

For temporal sequences of images, orientation in space-time corresponds to velocity <ref> [1] </ref>, so we expect that steerable filters will be useful in motion analysis.

Reference-contexts: Unlike the pyramids based on QMF's, the steerable pyramid described here is significantly overcomplete: not counting the residual image, there are 5 1 3 times as many coefficients in the representation as in the original image (1 1 3 times over-complete, as with the Laplacian pyramid <ref> [5] </ref>, but for each of 4 orientations). The overcompleteness limits its efficiency but increases its convenience for many image processing tasks.

Let us write the nth derivative of a Gaussian in the x direction as G n . <p> The final summation produces the adaptively filtered image. An alternative approach to the steerable filters presented here would be to project all rotations of a function onto a complete set of orthogonal basis functions, such as the Hermite functions, or the polynomials used in the facet model <ref> [16] </ref>. One could then steer the filter by changing the expansion coefficients. Such expansions allow flexible control over the filter, but for purposes of steering they generally require more basis functions than the minimum number given by Theorem 2. <p> The result is much less noisy than the output of an isotropic filter of the same frequency passband, Fig. 12 (c), contrast enhanced in the same manner. 5.3 Contour Detection Filters with orientation tuning are often used in the detection of lines and edges <ref> [6, 16] </ref>.

Conventional filter design techniques [25, 33] allow the design of a circularly symmetric 2-D filter with a desired radial response.

Reference-contexts: The range image successfully captures the basic characteristics of the object relief. 6 Three-Dimensional Steerable Filters Volumetric spatial data and temporal image sequences require three-dimensional processing. As with two dimensional data, the ability to adaptively orient filters has many applications (e.g., <ref> [20] </ref>). For temporal sequences of images, orientation in space-time corresponds to velocity [1], so we expect that steerable filters will be useful in motion analysis.

Steerable filters offer an efficient method for such processing. (Martens [27] used the steerable properties of derivatives of Gaussians for image enhancement.)

The constraints on the multi-scale decomposition lead to the radial frequency response shown in Fig. 6 (a). We used the frequency transformation method <ref> [25] </ref> to convert the 1-D filter to a nearly angularly symmetric 2-D filter, Fig. 6 (b). Having selected a radial frequency band, we next divided the band into four oriented subbands by imposing an angular variation of cos 3 (-), where is azimuthal angle in frequency.

Reference-contexts: Filters can also be designed in the frequency domain, where one may separate the radial and angular parts of the design [19]. Conventional filter design techniques <ref> [25, 33] </ref> allow the design of a circularly symmetric 2-D filter with a desired radial response. Then, one can impose on that filter the angular variation needed to make a steerable basis set by frequency sampling [25] (if the angular response is relatively smooth).

Fig. 6 shows an example of this. The filter was designed to be part of a steerable, self-inverting pyramid image decomposition <ref> [41] </ref>, described below. The constraints on the multi-scale decomposition lead to the radial frequency response shown in Fig. 6 (a). We used the frequency transformation method [25] to convert the 1-D filter to a nearly angularly symmetric 2-D filter, Fig. 6 (b). <p> The frequency responses of the resulting four steerable digital filters are shown in (c - f). 4.3 Steerable Pyramid for Multi-Scale Decomposition We have also used the steerable filters to form a multi-scale, self-inverting pyramid decomposition <ref> [41] </ref>. Applying each filter of the decomposition once to the signal gives the transform coefficients; applying each filter a second time (with filter tap values reflected about the origin) and adding the results reconstructs a low-passed version of the image.
