Abstract: Recently a class of multiscale stochastic models has been introduced in which Gaussian random processes are described by scale-recursive dynamics that are indexed by the nodes of a tree. One of the primary reasons the framework is useful is that it leads to an extremely fast, statistically optimal algorithm for least-squares estimation in the context of 2-D images. In this paper, we refine this approach to estimation by eliminating the visually distracting blockiness that has been observed in previous work. We eliminate the blockiness by discarding the standard assumption that distinct nodes at a given level of our tree correspond to disjoint portions of the image domain; as a consequence of this simple idea, a given image pixel may now correspond to several tree nodes. We develop tools for systematically building overlapping-tree multiscale representations of prespecified statistics, and we develop a corresponding estimation algorithm for this processes. In this way, we achieve nearly optimal estimation results, we generate corresponding error covariance information, and we eliminate blockiness without sacrificing the resolution of fine-scale detail.

In spite of the success of the multiscale approach with regard to computational efficiency, mean-square estimation error, and ability to supply error covariance information, the approach arguably suffers two limitations: 1. Automatic multiscale model development tools are re quired. 2.

Reference-contexts: We select a multiscale model such that x (s) contains suitable linear func-tionals of the finest-scale process to achieve this q + 1-way conditional independence. In general, exact realization of desired statistics will require a very high order multiscale model. However, by suitably generalizing the work in <ref> [4] </ref>, [5], we have developed a systematic and broadly applicable procedure for building reduced-order, approximate models of any desired fidelity. This procedure is based on a novel application of the techniques of canonical correlation analysis, and allows us to effectively confront the model complexity/algorithm speed tradeoff. IV.
