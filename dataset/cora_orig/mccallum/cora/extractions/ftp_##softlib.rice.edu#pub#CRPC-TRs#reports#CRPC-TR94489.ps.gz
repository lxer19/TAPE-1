Title: PROBLEM FORMULATION FOR MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION  
Author: EVIN J. CRAMER J. E. DENNIS, JR. PAUL D. FRANK ROBERT MICHAEL LEWIS AND GREGORY R. SHUBIN 
Keyword: Constrained optimization, multidisciplinary design optimization, optimal design, computational engineering.  
Abstract: This paper is about multidisciplinary (design) optimization, or MDO, the coupling of two or more analysis disciplines with numerical optimization. The paper has three goals. First, it is an expository introduction to MDO aimed at those who do research on optimization algorithms, since the optimization community has much to contribute to this important class of computational engineering problems. Second, this paper presents for the MDO research community a new abstraction for multidisciplinary analysis and design problems as well as new decomposition formulations for these problems. Third, the "individual discipline feasible" (IDF) approaches introduced here make use of existing specialized analysis codes, and they introduce significant opportunities for coarse-grained computational parallelism particularly well-suited to heterogeneous computing environments. The key distinguishing characteristic of the three fundamental approaches to MDO formulation discussed here is the kind of disciplinary feasibility that must be maintained at each optimization iteration. Other formulation issues, such as the sensitivities required, are also considered. This discussion highlights the trade-offs between reuse of existing software, computational requirements, and probability of success. 1. Introduction. This paper is about multidisciplinary (design) optimization,

Reference-contexts: Section 7 discusses some issues related to choosing a formulation, and make some concluding remarks. Section 8 presents a simple example of the different MDO formulations discussed in this paper. The contents of this paper represent an abstraction and generalization of more specific material presented in <ref> [3] </ref>. 2. Example: Aeroelastic Optimization. A specific problem is very useful in thinking about MDO. For us the model problem is aeroelastic optimization. We use this example to define some terms, and throughout the text we will refer to this example to illustrate the model and the various problem formulations.

Reference-contexts: Using traditional terminology derived from linear programming, (see <ref> [6] </ref> (pg. 253) or [17]), the reader may recognize MDF as a reduced basis formulation in which X D is the nonbasic vector and everything else is a basic vector. <p> For example, an optimization algorithm that ensures constraint feasibility at each iteration could reduce, or even eliminate, the distinctions between the formulations presented here. We examine this issue further by briefly discussing the distinction between a generalized reduced gradient (GRG) approach (see <ref> [6] </ref> (pg. 221)) that corresponds to MDF, and an approach applied to a full-space problem like AAO that restores feasibility at every iteration. Some nonlinear programming algorithms approach optimality along a feasible path by following each optimization step with a step to restore feasibility.

Derivatives required for the MDF formulation. For MDF optimization, Sobieszczanski-Sobieski <ref> [13] </ref> gives a complete presentation of the alternative approaches, but our MDO model includes the fit and evaluate routines and so the form is slightly different here. <p> Note that the derivatives required for the IDF formulation are the same as those required in (22) and by Sobieszczanski-Sobieski <ref> [13] </ref> (in his GSE2 approach) for computing MDF problem derivatives. However, in contrast to the MDF method, here they only need to be evaluated at an individual discipline feasible point. 7. Concluding Remarks. In Table 1 we compare the features of our three main approaches to MDO formulation.

Reference-contexts: The other alternative, of course, is to use simplified analyses in the optimization and then to correct via iterative refinement. For example, this approach has been used in multidisciplinary design of helicopter rotors <ref> [15] </ref>. We observe that this approach dovetails well with the IDF approach, where an existing multidisciplinary analysis procedure can be viewed as "one discipline," and information of higher fidelity for a single analysis code can be the "second discipline" [22].
