Title: Rigid Molecular Docking by Surface Registration at Multiple Resolutions  
Author: Doug Ierardi Seongbin Park

Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Southern California  
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of rigid molecular docking that arises in biochemical and pharmaceutical research. We study a geometric approach to the problem based upon surface complementarity matching, or registration, and develop a heuristic algorithm recovering the best such matches. An implementation of the algorithm is evaluated on sample problems from the literature.

Reference-contexts: Denser samplings of the surfaces and configuration space would help, but have an immediate impact on the time and space requirements of the algorithm. Hence we proceed by running the procedure at varying resolutions. A molecular surface is first constructed using Connolly's algorithm <ref> [Con83] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: And since the geometric procedure is actually a filtering step, one would also like to find many good solutions, not just the single best. Several methods have been studied for rigid docking of this sort. For example, <ref> [Con86] </ref> attempted to characterize complementary patterns of "knobs" and "holes" for pairs of molecular surfaces. He succeeded in docking the ff and fi subunits of hemoglobin with this procedure. [JK91] used cube-based representations of molecular surfaces.

[G0] is an example of a numerical approach that used simulated annealing from a given starting position for the ligand outside of the receptor.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The molecular docking problem arises in the design of computational tools for the discovery of promising pharmaceutical compounds, once the 3-dimensional structure of a target receptor or the binding site of a particular protein has been solved. The Dock program <ref> [Kun82] </ref>, for example, searches a database of chemical structures for lead compounds for a given receptor. More recent applications of the problem also try to extend some of these ideas to the rational design of compounds to interact with given receptors.
