Title: Wavelet-Based Numerical Homogenization  
Author: Mihai Dorobantu and Bjorn Engquist 
Date: February 2, 1996  
Abstract: A numerical homogenization procedure for elliptic differential equations is presented. It is based on wavelet decompositions of discrete operators in fine- and coarse-scale components followed by the elimination of the fine-scale contributions. If the operator is in divergence form, this is preserved by this homogenization procedure. For periodic problems, results similar to classical effective coefficient theory are proved. The procedure can be applied to problems that are not cell-periodic and can be viewed as a direct solver using approximate and sparse block Gauss elimination.

Reference-contexts: The homogenization problem can be stated in various formulations. A classical formulation, see e.g. Bensoussan et al. <ref> [1] </ref>, is the following: Consider a family of operators L " indexed by the small parameter ", and for a given f , let u " solve the problem L " u " = f: (1) Assume that u " ! u, as " ! 0. <p> 5 (right) plots the solutions of 1 (2h) 2 + H - u J = 1 with only - = 3; 5; 7 diagonals. 4 2-D Problems Numerical homogenization for multi-dimensional problems is of great interest since the analytic methods can only handle periodic micro-structures, see e.g., Bensous-san et al. <ref> [1] </ref>.

In applications, if we want to use the homogenized coefficient matrices, we would not invert A j , but rather LU-factorize it in the prescribed bandwidth -.

Reference-contexts: In the case of effective coefficients, the solution of the homogenized equation contains no high frequency components and thus it is an approximation to the coarse scale behavior of u " . In a very interesting paper, M. E. Brewster and G. Beylkin <ref> [3] </ref> describe a homogeniza-tion procedure based on a multi-resolution analysis (MRA) decomposition. They consider integral equations, which may arise, e.g., from the Method of Lines dis-cretization of a PDE, and homogenize over the time-variable.
