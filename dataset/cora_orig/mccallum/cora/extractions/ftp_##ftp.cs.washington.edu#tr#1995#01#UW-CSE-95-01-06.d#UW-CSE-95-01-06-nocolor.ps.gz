Reference-contexts: This basic approach to image querying has been referred to in a variety of ways, including query by content <ref> [1, 4, 20] </ref>, query by example [10, 13, 14], similarity retrieval [6, 16, 17, 21, 35] and sketch retrieval [14]. Note that this type of content-based querying can also be applied in conjunction with keyword-based querying or any other existing approach. Several factors make this problem difficult to solve. <p> of color ): A A= h while h &gt; 1 do: h h=2 A 0 [i] (A [2i] + A [2i + 1])= 2 p end for end while end proc In the pseudocode above, the entries of A are assumed to be 3-dimensional color components, each in the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We have not experimented with other wavelet bases; others may work as well as or better than Haar (although will undoubtedly be slower). 3. Decomposition type. We need to choose either a standard or non-standard type of two-dimensional wavelet decomposition <ref> [2, 31] </ref>. In the Haar basis the non-standard basis functions are square, whereas the standard basis functions are rectangular. <p> The constant factor in front of this linear term is small, as discussed in Section 5. At a high level, the algorithm can be described as follows: In a preprocessing step, we perform a standard two-dimensional Haar wavelet decomposition <ref> [2, 31] </ref> of every image in the database, and store just the overall average color and the indices and signs of the m largest-magnitude wavelet coefficients. The indices for all of the database images are then organized into a single data structure in the program that optimizes searching.

In their system, called query by visual example (QVE), edge extraction is performed on user queries.

Reference-contexts: One commonly-employed searching strategy is to index the image database with keywords. However, such an approach is also fraught with difficulties. First, it requires a person to manually tag all the images with keys, a time-consuming task. Second, as Niblack et al. point out <ref> [20] </ref>, this keyword approach has the problem that some visual aspects are inherently difficult to describe, while others are equally well described in many different ways. In addition, it may be difficult for the user to guess which visual aspects have been indexed. <p> This basic approach to image querying has been referred to in a variety of ways, including query by content <ref> [1, 4, 20] </ref>, query by example [10, 13, 14], similarity retrieval [6, 16, 17, 21, 35] and sketch retrieval [14].

Reference-contexts: In all of these applications, improving the technology for content-based querying is an important and acknowledged challenge [8]. 1.1 Related work Previous approaches to content-based image querying have applied such properties as color histograms <ref> [33] </ref>, texture analysis [12], and shape features like circularity and major-axis orientation of regions in the image [7], as well as combinations of these techniques. One of the most notable systems for querying by image content, called QBIC, was developed at IBM [20] and is now available commercially.

Reference-contexts: This problem is related to that of finding a good perceptual error metric for images, although, to our knowledge, most previous work in this area has been devoted primarily to minimizing image artifacts, for example, in image compression <ref> [11, 24, 34] </ref>. Since there is no obvious correct metric to use for image querying, we are faced with the problem of constructing one from scratch, using (informed) trial and error.

Reference-contexts: This basic approach to image querying has been referred to in a variety of ways, including query by content [1, 4, 20], query by example [10, 13, 14], similarity retrieval <ref> [6, 16, 17, 21, 35] </ref> and sketch retrieval [14]. Note that this type of content-based querying can also be applied in conjunction with keyword-based querying or any other existing approach. Several factors make this problem difficult to solve.

Reference-contexts: The content-based querying method we describe has applications in many different domains, including graphic design, architecture [30], TV production [27], multimedia [29], ubiquitous computing <ref> [36] </ref>, art history [13], geology [26], satellite image databases [16], and medical imaging [15]. For example, a graphic designer may want to find an image that is stored on her own system using a painted query.
