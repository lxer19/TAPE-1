Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a new model for robot navigation in large unstructured environments. Our model consists of two parts, the map-maker and the navigator. Given a source and a goal, the map-maker derives a navigational path based on the topological relationships between landmarks. A navigational path is generated as a combination of "parkway" and "trajectory" paths, both of which are abstractions of the real world into topological data structures. Traversing within a parkway enables the navigator to follow visible landmarks. Traversing on a trajectory enables the navigator to move reliably towards a target, based on shapes formed by visible landmarks. Error detection and error recovery routines are also encoded into the path segments. The optimal path is further abstracted into a "custom map," which consists of a list of directional instructions, the vocabulary of which is defined by our environmental description language. Based on the custom map generated by the map-maker, the navigating robot looks for events that are characterized by spatial properties of the environment. The map-maker and navigator are implemented using two cameras, an IBM 7575 robot arm, and a PIPE (Pipelined Image Processing Engine.)

Reference-contexts: This is the central idea of the parkway concept: a given object in the window can serve as the current reference landmark, and another object in the same window can serve as the current "goal" landmark. Then, by applying the connected component algorithm <ref> [AHU74] </ref> using the above definition of "connectedness", we can then generate discrete sets of connected components. We define a parkway to be such a connected component. It is navigated somewhat like crossing a stream by hopping from rock to rock: each point must be (visually) reachable from the previous one. <p> Measurement of connectedness of the parkways (through trajectories) is derived by applying the strongly connected component algorithm on this directed graph <ref> [AHU74] </ref>. The right diagram of figure 1 shows an example of trajectories computed on our random world. The straight lines are the trajectories of the window in the direction of the sliding movement.

Reference-contexts: Part of this paper is motivated by questions concerning landmarks, such as, (1) what is a good landmark (2) what visual features of a landmark are important (3) what sensors are to be used to recognize a landmark efficiently <ref> [KL89] </ref> (4) how to describe a landmark to the navigator (5) how to detect errors and (6) how to recover from them. In attempting to answer these questions, we suggest a dichotomy of roles in the navigation system: a superior direction giver (map-maker) and a dumb direction follower (navigator).

Reference-contexts: Currently, we have implemented cost functions that estimate the distance of navigation path D and the unreliability of navigation path R, and (in a separate work <ref> [KPY90] </ref>) S and M of the 3 fi 3 world 2 . One of map-maker's responsibility is to generate a path that either minimizes D, or maximizes R. Unfortunately, in some environments, these two cost estimates are in a direct conflict of each other (figure 4).

Reference-contexts: To our surprise, isolated landmarks were sufficiently robust and flexible, and therefore we were able to build a complete system by only using isolated landmark descriptors. Other types of landmarks that we considered include "obvious points", "isolated pairs", "confusable points", and "new points" <ref> [Par93] </ref>. 4 Error handling In this section, we focus on various problems that relate to errors that occur before and during the navigation. <p> Analytic results, necessary for the creation of reliable directions, quantifying the robustness of parkways and trajectories under various perturbations such as sensor or movement error, are provided in [PK93] <ref> [Par93] </ref>. The second method is "recovery", and is accomplished by the navigator during its navigational task. At each "check-point", the navigator examines its immediate surrounding to verify that it is on the correct course. <p> As we can see, QOC of object I is unique within this view window, thus error can be detected by examining the QOC of the obtained landmark. 1 We suggest some other Observe (Q) functions, such as QOS, QPC, and QPS, in Park <ref> [Par93] </ref>. 4.2 Error recovery in parkways When the error has been detected, the navigator is "lost", and therefore may be forced to give up its task of getting to the goal. <p> The generated path will tend to favor short paths and sparsely populated areas. Note that R is a function of not only n (population) but also (position estimate error) <ref> [Par93] </ref>. If is small, the path will resemble the D-path and if is large, the path will resemble the R-path. This means that if the navigator's metric ability within its window is good, the optimal path will be the metrically shortest path. <p> Figure 5 shows the configuration of the map-maker and the navigator. 6.1 Sparse versus densely populated en vironment Statistical experiments showed that the reliability of an isolated point is inversely proportional to the number of visible objects , n, and proportional to the sensor's accuracy, <ref> [Par93] </ref>. Our test runs with the (path starts in the lower right). robot arm navigator agreed with these statistical results. The robot tends to fail in (1) highly populated environments, and in (2) areas of environments where there are large clusters of objects.

We argue that without detailed criteria for defining and selecting good landmarks, topological navigation is not possible.
