Title: Server  
Author: James R. Davis Dean B. Krafft Carl Lagoze 
Abstract: Dienst: Building a Production Technical Report Abstract Dienst is a protocol and implementation that provides Internet access to a distributed, decentralized multi-format document collection. It supports full text and boolean searches, thumbnail visual browsing, on- screen reading, and printing. In this paper we describe a number of issues that arose as we developed Dienst, including copyright policy, document management, and handling multiple formats of documents, and then lay out a number of areas where we still need to make progress, including interoperability among heterogeneous search engines, reliability, logical document structuring, and technology transfer.

Reference-contexts: The document librarian must be able to produce paper copy for archival storage and for people who do not have electronic access. For this purpose, we have developed an interface between the Dienst database and the Xerox Docutech publishing system <ref> [1] </ref>. This 10 system can be used to produce very high-quality bound and covered hard-copy of any document in the library database. Finally, the Dienst software includes an extensive document database checker utility.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this chapter, we describe our experiences with designing, implementing, and distributing Dienst. Dienst <ref> [2] </ref> is a protocol and implementation that provides In ternet access to a distributed, decentralized multi-format document collection.

Reference-contexts: A number of other systems have been developed based on client/server architecture. Notable among these are the System 33 Document Service [6] from Xerox, the RightPages system [7] from AT&T Bell Laboratories, and the CORE project <ref> [3] </ref> from BellCore, Cornell University, OCLC, and others. Each of these systems use proprietary clients, servers, and protocols. Finally, there are a number of systems that, while accessed through the World Wide Web, are mostly interfaces to central indexing sites; the actual documents are retrieved using URL's to FTP sites.

Reference-contexts: The legal status of technical reports distributed over the Internet was (and is) unclear. Does network distribution count as publication, or is it a performance of the work <ref> [4] </ref>? What happens when someone prints a copy? Does fair use apply to reports performed over the network? After extensive discussions with authors, librarians, and lawyers, we devised a scheme for dealing with copyright on Cornell technical reports.

Reference-contexts: These systems are often difficult to use, because of limited user interfaces, and deliver only ASCII documents. A number of other systems have been developed based on client/server architecture.

Reference-contexts: Frequently, there would be no explicit copyright notice on the publication, which before March 1989 effectively put the technical report in the public domain <ref> [8, chapter 4] </ref>. Moreover, authors would typically assign exclusive rights for a journal version of the same paper to another publisher, with both author and publisher ignoring the existence of a technical report version of the paper.
