Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of determining an object's 3D location from a sequence of camera images recorded by a mobile robot. The approach presented here allows people to train robots to recognize specific objects, by presenting it examples of the object to be recognized. A decision tree method is used to learn significant features of the target object from individual camera images. Individual estimates are integrated over time using Bayes rule, into a probabilistic 3D model of the robot's environment. Experimental results illustrate that the method enables a mobile robot to robustly estimate the 3D loca tion of objects from multiple camera images.

Reference-contexts: Our approach can handle situations that contain a variable (unknown) number of target objects. Finally, the problem of finding and manipulating objects has received considerable attention within the AI community (see [Hor94] and various papers in [Sim95, KBM98]). For example, Buhmann et al. <ref> [BBC + 95] </ref> described an approach where a robot could be trained to recognize specific objects. Most existing approaches in the mobile robot community, however, make the assumption that the object is located in floor-height, in which case camera coordinates can directly be converted to real-world coordinates.
