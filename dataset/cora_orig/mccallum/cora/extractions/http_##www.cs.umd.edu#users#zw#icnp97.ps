Abstract: A critical functional component of quality-of-service (QoS) deployment in packet-switched networks is QoS-based routing. In this paper, we present a routing solution for guaranteed quality-of-service connections in integrated services packet networks (ISPN) the future QoS-capable Internet proposed by the IETF. The problem is in essence a path finding problem with both end-to-end delay and per-node buffer constraints, in networks with heterogeneous intermediate switching nodes. We present a polynomial time algorithm using a capacity plane decomposition technique combined with a per-node constrained shortest path algorithm. We further propose an efficient route computation architecture, based on a novel metric-separation approach, to a slightly restricted version of the problem. The strategy is somewhat similar to "route caching", but in a new and broader sense.

Reference-contexts: These detrimental effects may to some extent compromise the potential benefits brought forward by the QoS deployment in future networks. In this paper, we address the problem of quality-of-service based routing for Guaranteed Service in Integrated Services Packet Networks (ISPN) <ref> [1] </ref>. ISPN is a recent proposal by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) aimed at establishing a quality-of-service architecture in the Internet. The proposal defines two new classes of connections with different levels of QoS guarantees, guaranteed service and controlled-load service, in addition to the traditional best effort service. <p> After discussing some related work in Section 7, we conclude the paper with a summary. 2 Guaranteed Quality of Service The IEFT proposed a packet delivery service called guaranteed service with firm end-to-end delay and zero packet loss <ref> [1] </ref>. It is defined with reference to a fluid model of service, which is essentially the service provided by a dedicated wire of bandwidth R between a pair of end points.

Reference-contexts: However, routing with separate bottleneck bandwidth and additive delay constraints can be solved in polynomial time. In particular, Wang et.al. [17] and Guerin et.al. [9] proposed algorithms to find the "shortest widest path". For networks with fluid-approximating switching nodes, bandwidth and delay are closely coupled. Chen et.al. <ref> [2] </ref> presented algorithms for a different but related "quickest path problem". Guerin et.al. [10] considered routing with inaccurate network information. Neither considered buffer constraints. Ma et.al. [11] and Porn-navalai et.al. [13] proposed polynomial Bellman-Ford routing algorithms in networks consisting of homogeneous WFQ-like scheduling nodes.

Reference-contexts: Given a connection setup request, a network path is feasible if sufficient resources exist along the path to meet the connection's QoS requirements. The QoS-based routing problem is thus to find a path with sufficient resources for the connection to be routed along <ref> [4, 9, 17] </ref>. Among the above three service classes, routing for guaranteed service is the most critical problem due to its inherently stringent resource requirements on the network components along the connection path. In this paper, we formulate the guaranteed service routing problem and present solutions to it.
