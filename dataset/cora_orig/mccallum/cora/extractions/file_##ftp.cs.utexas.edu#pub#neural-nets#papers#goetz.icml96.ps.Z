Abstract: Several researchers have demonstrated how neural networks can be trained to compensate for nonlinear signal distortion in e.g. digital satellite communications systems. These networks, however, require that both the original signal and its distorted version are known. Therefore, they have to be trained off-line, and they cannot adapt to changing channel characteristics. In this paper, a novel dual reinforcement learning approach is proposed that can adapt on-line while the system is performing. Assuming that the channel characteristics are the same in both directions, two predistorters at each end of the communication channel co-adapt using the output of the other predistorter to determine their own reinforcement. Using the common Volterra Series model to simulate the channel, the system is shown to successfully learn to compensate for distortions up to 30%, which is significantly higher than what might be expected in an actual channel.

Reference-contexts: However, the combination of the pulse shaping circuit (modulator) in the transmitter with the nonlinear HPA and the demodulator in the receiver results in a nonlinear system with memory <ref> (Benvenuto et al. 1993) </ref>. Consequently, the next step in the development of the model is to add memory to the Predistorter to compensate for the memory of the channel.

Reference-contexts: results suggest that such a system could be effectively used to track continuously changing distortions in real satellite communication systems. 2 Signal and Channel Characteristics Since real-valued signals have a symmetric spectral distribution with respect to the DC value, with modulation it is difficult to use the frequency band efficiently <ref> (Eun 1995) </ref>. Consequently, binary data is often encoded as complex symbols prior to transmission. A number of different complex signal formats are used in telecommunications.

Reference-contexts: The typical HPA, a traveling-wave tube or a GaAs FET amplifier, nonlinearly distorts both the amplitude and the phase of the amplified signal, but can be regarded as memoryless over wide range of operating conditions <ref> (Saleh 1981) </ref>. However, the combination of the pulse shaping circuit (modulator) in the transmitter with the nonlinear HPA and the demodulator in the receiver results in a nonlinear system with memory (Benvenuto et al. 1993).

Reference-contexts: To conserve power, the HPA is operated at near saturation, which introduces nonlinear distortions in both the phase and the amplitude of the transmitted complex signal. These distortions can result in a phenomenon known as "intersymbol interference" <ref> (Widrow and Winter 1988) </ref>, where the symbols received by the receiver do not exactly match those sent by the transmitter. A compensator is a device that acts as a channel inverse, and thereby can be used to reduce signal distortions.
