Reference-contexts: A predisposition to learn created by evolution can also be expressed in other ways, for example as the inheritance of an appropriate learning rate or momentum for learning some particular task <ref> (cf. Belew, McInerney, and Schraudolph, 1991) </ref> or, in more ecological conditions, as an inherited tendency to behave in such a way that the individual is exposed to the appropriate learning experiences.

Reference-contexts: input for some supervised learning task is only physically available in some specific locations in the environment, networks can be shown to evolve and, therefore, to inherit genetically a tendency to move in the environment in such a way that they tend to approach and stay close to those locations <ref> (Denaro and Parisi, 1994) </ref>. 3.

Reference-contexts: As a matter of fact, a population of networks which are selected for the ability to capture food and at the same time "learn" during life on the basis of randomly generated teaching input, has a better evolutionary fitness curve than a population with no learning at all <ref> (Parisi, Nolfi, and Cecconi, 1991) </ref>. (H&N simulations are a pure example of learning as random movement in 6 weight space. <p> For example, if one trains networks to do the XOR task and the networks belong to a population selected for the ability to capture food, one obtains the same result <ref> (cf. Parisi, Nolfi, and Cecconi, 1991) </ref>.
