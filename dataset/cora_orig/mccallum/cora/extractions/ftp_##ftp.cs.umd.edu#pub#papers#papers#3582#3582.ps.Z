Abstract: Technological trends suggest that soon communication networks will consist of a high speed wired backbone with numerous wireless Local Area Networks. Mobile computing and wireless subnetworks are increasingly in demand. Mobile routing solutions provide wireless LANs with seamless connectivity to backbone wired systems. However, these solutions do not provide acceptable performance. Wireless networks have distinct transmission characteristics which present challenges to achieving efficient performance. Performance over wireless links is limited by high error rates, mobility, and low bandwidth. We have studied the performance of TCP and NFS over a wireless network. The prevalence of these protocols means that mobile hosts will frequently use them when communicating with stationary hosts. Measurements have been collected to determine the response of these protocols in the presence of various error patterns. These measurements show that NFS and TCP performance suffer extreme degradation due to these wireless link characteristics. Unexpectedly, NFS performance is not better than an TCP FTP file transfer. NFS performance over wireless links is limited by large packet sizes, long retransmission timeouts, and slow response to losses. Our goal is to understand the effects of wireless communication on these protocols and improve performance without requiring changes to the current network Infrastructure.

Reference-contexts: Since NFS is prevalent throughout the Internet, mobile users will interact with this protocol whenever they access files available on traditional wired networks. Mobility and high error rates cause poor performance in both TCP and NFS. Many studies have investigated the performance of TCP over wireless networks [CI94], [YB94], <ref> [BB94] </ref>, but NFS performance has not yet received this attention. We believe that it is important to study the dynamics of these protocols and determine which features cause the poor performance in the presence of errors. <p> Some studies investigate the effect of adding link layer retransmissions to improve the throughput of the wireless link [BKT95],[DCY93]. Others propose higher layer methods for improving the TCP performance over wireless links, such as partitioning the connection [YB94], <ref> [BB94] </ref> or notifying the transport layer of host motion [CI94]. 2.1 Wireless Link Retransmissions Selective retransmission can be implemented to react to the high loss rates over the wireless link. <p> If buffered packets have been acknowledged by the base, then consistency problems could result from disconnection or migration by the mobile host. Bakre and Badrinath consider the performance of TCP in the presence of mobile host cell switches <ref> [BB94] </ref> and propose Indirect TCP (I-TCP). This study uses a wireless testbed and simulated cell switches. Yavatkar and Bhagawat have studied the performance of TCP in the presence of wireless links. <p> Both proposals, <ref> [BB94] </ref>,[YB94], claim dramatic throughput improvement, but only end-to-end throughput comparisons are given. In the first study, throughput values are given for TCP and I-TCP. On a wide area connection, with a cell switch, the I-TCP enables 19.12 KB/s compared to a 8.89 KB/s throughput for regular TCP [BB94]. In the second study, the throughput for a wide area connection with ten percent loss is 1.8 KB/s originally and 3.6KB/s with the partitioned connection [YB94]. These are very different values and can not be fairly compared since the environment is different.

Reference-contexts: DeSimone et al. [DCY93] have shown that link layer retransmissions can adversely affect the end-to-end mechanisms of reliable transport protocols reducing end-to-end throughput and increasing the wireless link utilization. One possible method is to introduce a low level protocol, a Channel State Dependent Packet scheduler, to control packet transmission <ref> [BKT95] </ref>. This method maintains a queue for each destination and switches between these hosts based on the quality of the 'channel' to each host. <p> Frequency hopping wireless LANs are especially prone to burst errors as they may hop onto a frequency which is especially susceptible to interference. This interference is likely to decrease with the next frequency change <ref> [BKT95] </ref>. The performance of RF systems is limited by the frequent periods of burst losses caused by fading, shadowing, and interference. During a period of burst losses a host receives only a weak signal and all packet transmission attempts to a specific destination fail with a very high probability. <p> These burst losses effectively create a period of disconnection from the base station. Typical observed burst periods on RF wireless LANs are in the range of 100 to 500 milliseconds <ref> [BKT95] </ref>. Several studies have developed finite state Markovian models to characterize the bit errors observed on RF channels [SF94],[WM95],[SKKF93]. In [SKKF93], the burst error channel in specified by the three state Markov model. A bit sequence is broken into guard sections and burst sections. <p> Transitions back to the guard state occur only after the necessary error free length has occurred. Together the second and third states represent a burst error. The burst losses can be characterized by a two state Markov error model <ref> [BKT95] </ref>. The two states consist of a 'bad' state and a 'good' state. The bad state represents the time a channel is in burst error mode, and the good state represents the time when a channel is error free. <p> Link layer acknowledgments are sent by the receiver, and the transmitter will retry several times if no link level ack is received. In the presence of burst errors, however, successive retransmissions are likely to fail. A channel dependent retransmission policy, as suggested in <ref> [BKT95] </ref>, would handle this problem by deferring link level retransmissions until it was probable that the burst period had ended. NFS performance is harmed by both large packet size and by the retransmission policy. <p> Out experiments have provided insight into the complexities of these two protocols in the presence of various types of error patterns. Further research will be conducted to devise solutions to the performance problems investigated in this paper. Link level solutions, such as Channel State Dependent Packet Scheduling <ref> [BKT95] </ref>, require added functions in the link layer transmitters. Successful link level solutions have the advantage of improving the performance of both TCP and NFS, as well as other applications. NFS performance can be improved by modifying the file system behavior of the mobile host.

One possible approach is the use of a link layer protocol to control retransmissions on the wireless link and hide such losses from the higher layers. <p> Since errors occur more frequently on this link, some researchers claim that retransmission over the wired part of the connection waste bandwidth and time. Other researchers argue that competing retransmission schemes in the link and transport layers will reduce end-to-end throughput even though the link utilization is increased <ref> [CI94] </ref>, [YB94]. DeSimone et al. [DCY93] have shown that link layer retransmissions can adversely affect the end-to-end mechanisms of reliable transport protocols reducing end-to-end throughput and increasing the wireless link utilization. <p> This graph shows the long idle periods that can result from burst losses. Here consecutive losses cause idle periods of approximately 2, 6, and 7 seconds. Caceres and Iftode observed that mobile host cell switches caused unacceptably long pauses in TCP, between 1 and 7 seconds <ref> [CI94] </ref>. These values are almost identical to the pauses seen in figure 2. They attribute these long pauses in communication to the current retransmission and congestion control polices in TCP, and they propose a fast retransmission scheme, which notifies the transport layer of host migration and thereby reduces these pauses. <p> If the delays and losses are due to host motion, the retransmission times should be in between these two ranges, on the order of seconds. Caceres and Iftode <ref> [CI94] </ref> propose notification of host motion to the transport layer, which might also help determine the appropriate retransmission policy in this case. Better link level technologies are needed to enable effective interpretation of wireless link losses.

Reference-contexts: RF LANs have time varying error characteristics as the relative position of the communicating hosts changes. Especially at the edge of propagation range, the channel quality is highly unstable and error prone, as shown by <ref> [DR94] </ref>. The experiment conducted by Duchamp and Reynolds 6 examined indoor radio propagation performance and determined that the region just beyond the reliable range is highly unstable and the quality of the channel varies greatly and non-linearly. <p> When unstable conditions occurred, smaller packets were captured much more successfully than larger packets <ref> [DR94] </ref>. Mobility causes additional errors not only as hosts move out of range of the base station but also as they move into fading zones. Fading is a rapid fluctuation in the signal strength caused by multipath propagation.

Reference-contexts: Interference patterns create zones in which transmission signals are weak and losses frequent. Changes in topography can cause slower changes in signal level as a result of shadowing from objects or signal interference from neighboring hosts <ref> [Fre78] </ref>. Frequency hopping wireless LANs are especially prone to burst errors as they may hop onto a frequency which is especially susceptible to interference. This interference is likely to decrease with the next frequency change [BKT95].

Reference-contexts: For example, if a server fails, the client simply must repeat the attempt to complete the operations until the server is repaired [WLea85]. The NFS protocol is implemented using the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol <ref> [Gro88] </ref>. NFS uses RPC to make procedure calls such as read, write, and getattr. Procedures in NFS are synchronous, which means that the client blocks until the server returns the results.

Reference-contexts: Since these protocols are so complex, it is very difficult to determine that a given scenario will apply to a different environment. 2.3 Network File System The Network File System (NFS) is a protocol that permits transparent, remote access to file systems in a heterogeneous network of machines <ref> [Gro89] </ref>, [WLea85], [PJS + 94]. NFS defines the traditional file system operations, such as reading directories and creating, deleting, writing, and reading files. Servers provide resources to the network, and clients access resources over the network. Any machine can be a client, a server, or both client and server.

Reference-contexts: Better link level technologies are needed to enable effective interpretation of wireless link losses. Alternative solutions for improving NFS performance include caching files on the mobile host or intelligent file prefetching. These methods have been suggested by those developing file systems for mobile hosts <ref> [HKM + 88] </ref>,[Sat90],[SKK + 90], and mobile clients should be developed with these intelligent file handling capabilities. The ability to prefetch and cache frequently needed files in essential to attain acceptable application performance for mobile hosts. Future research will investigate these methods for improving NFS performance over wireless links.

Reference-contexts: Nowicki discusses the use of TCP to implement NFS and proposes that NFS improvements can be obtained through the use of better timer algorithms and transfer size adjustments <ref> [Now89] </ref>. The use of TCP may not always be beneficial since the round trip TCP timers would also be timing the service time at the file server. These service times are much less well behaved than the round-trip times of a pure transport protocol.

Reference-contexts: When reading and writing large files, multiple requests must be sent to the server for a single file. To improve performance, NFS uses large packets, usually eight kilobytes, and leaves it to IP to perform fragmentation and reassembly. On wired systems, this proved to substantially increase performance <ref> [SGK + 85] </ref>. Wireless systems typically have smaller maximum transmission unit (MTU) sizes than their wired counterparts [YB94], which causes fragmentation of all large read and write requests. If one fragment is lost, the entire eight kilobyte packet must be retransmitted.
