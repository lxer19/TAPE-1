Abstract: We study the problem of maintaining authenticated communication over untrusted communication channels, in a scenario where the communicating parties may be occasionally and repeatedly broken into for transient periods of time. Once a party is broken into, its cryptographic keys are exposed and perhaps modified. Yet, we want parties whose security is thus compromised to regain their ability to communicate in an authenticated way aided by other parties. In this work we present a mathematical model for this highly adversarial setting, exhibiting salient properties and parameters, and then describe a practically-appealing protocol for the task of maintaining authenticated communication in this model. A key element in our solution is devising proactive distributed signature (PDS) schemes in our model. Although PDS schemes are known in the literature, they are all designed for a model where authenticated communication and broadcast primitives are available. We therefore show how these schemes can be modified to work in our model, where no such primitives are available a-priori. In the process of devising the above schemes, we also present a new definition of PDS schemes (and of distributed signature schemes in general). This definition may be of independent interest.

Reference-contexts: However, before we can present the construction we first need to define secure PDS schemes. Below we present a general paradigm 15 for defining "secure distributed signature schemes". This paradigm generalizes the <ref> [20] </ref> notion of security against existential forgery in the presence of chosen message attack: even after seeing signatures on messages of its choice, an adversary should be unable to come up with any new message and a valid signature of this message. <p> This approach does not require a distributed signature scheme to be based on any `traditional', or centralized signature scheme. Yet, when reduced to the special case of centralized signature schemes, the definition below coincides with the <ref> [20] </ref> definition. At the end of this section (Remark (5)) we briefly discuss an alternative approach towards defining secure distributed signature schemes, taken in [19]. In Section 3.1 we describe the ideal model for PDS schemes. <p> protocols: * An n node PDS schemes in the AL model, denoted by ALS = hAGen; ASign; AVer; ARfri, which is t-secure in the sense of Definition 10. * A centralized signature scheme, denoted by CS = hCGen; CSign; CVeri which is existentially unforgeable under an adaptive chosen message attack <ref> [20] </ref>. We use the schemes ALS and CS to construct an n node PDS scheme in the UL model, which we denote ULS = hU Gen; U Sign; U Ver; U Rfri, and then use the security of ALS; CS to prove that ULS is (t; t)-secure.
