Abstract: This paper look at the problem of assigning pins and generating a planar topological routing for a pin grid array package. There is a freedom of assigning any pin to any pad but the routing resource is more limited. We showed that a monotonic pin assignment has no detours and has one and only one monotonic topological routing. We proposed an algorithm (EVENPGA) that generates this type of topological routing. In addition, EVENPGA creates the optimal uniform distribution of wires and shortest wire length possible for all wires under the taxicab wiring metric. If the topological routing is routable, the maximum density of critical cuts along a ring is the minimum theoretically possible. Once the topological routing is done, physical layout can easily be obtained using Surf, a rubberband-based routing system.

Reference-contexts: This paper is the first to consider pin assignment in a package routing. The algorithms proposed in this paper guarantee a planar routing with the most uniform distribution of wires and shortest wire length in the taxicab wiring metric <ref> [1] </ref>. Previous work by Ying and Gu [2] and Tsai and Chen [3] require an input netlist. Both approaches uses the technique of iterative improvement. Our algorithm creates a topological routing directly and with optimal wire distribution. <p> Since a lot of work has been done on transforming a topological routing into geometric routing. The focus of this paper is on creating a topological routing with desired characteristics. The Surf routing system [5] is built on the theory developed by Maley <ref> [1] </ref>. The algorithms presented in this paper is implemented as a topological router within Surf. The transformation of topological routing to detailed routing is done by algorithms proposed by Dai, Dayan and Staepelaere [6]. <p> 1 (w) + p (Lemma 11) and the relation 1 (w) + 2 (w) = r 1, the bounds of a wire can be derived to be r 1 &lt; length (w) &lt; p We can do a better analysis by using the `Taxicab' wiring metric as discussed by Maley <ref> [1] </ref>. It is similar to Manhattan wiring metric but the equidistance square is rotated 45 degrees. The distance of a point (x; y) to origin is (jy + xj + jy xj)=2.

Reference-contexts: The two important results are uniform distribution of wiring and shortest wire length. Since a lot of work has been done on transforming a topological routing into geometric routing. The focus of this paper is on creating a topological routing with desired characteristics.

The transformation of topological routing to detailed routing is done by algorithms proposed by Dai, Dayan and Staepelaere [6]. <p> Hence we have the following theorem. Theorem 4 (Minimum Wire Length): EVENPGA produces a topological routing where each wire is of minimum length in taxicab wiring metric. 6 Implementation and Results implemented as a router module of Surf <ref> [5] </ref>. Surf provides a powerful framework on which the router can be easily built. Specifically, Surf has all the facilities to manipulate rubber-bands as a representation of topological routing.
