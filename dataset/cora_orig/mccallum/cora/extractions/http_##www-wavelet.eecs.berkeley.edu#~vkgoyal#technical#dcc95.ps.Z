Title: Quantization of Overcomplete Expansions  
Author: Vivek K Goyal, Martin Vetterli Nguyen T. Thao 
Affiliation: Dept. of Electrical Engineering Dept. of Electrical Electronic Eng. Univ. of California at Berkeley Hong Kong Univ. of Science Tech.  
Abstract: The use of overcomplete sets of vectors (redundant bases or frames) together with quantization is explored as an alternative to transform coding for signal compression. The goal is to retain the computational simplicity of transform coding while adding flexibility like adaptation to signal statistics. We show results using both fixed quantization in frames and greedy quantization using matching pursuit. An MSE slope of -6 dB/octave of frame redundancy is shown for a particular tight frame and is verified experimentally for another frame.

Reference-contexts: B &lt; 1 so that, 8f 2 H, Ajjf jj 2 M X j &lt; f; ' k &gt; j 2 Bjjf jj 2 : (1) We say that f' k g M k=1 is a frame or an overcomplete set of vectors with redundancy ratio R = M N <ref> [1] </ref>. Furthermore, if (1) holds for some A = B, we call the frame a tight frame. If f' k g M k=1 is a tight frame such that jj' k jj = 1 8 k, then A = R. <p> In principle, one could optimize each of these for a given source distribution, distortion measure and rate measure. Example: Consider quantization of a source x = [X 1 ; X 2 ] T with a uniform distribution on <ref> [1; 1] </ref> 2 .

Reference-contexts: The computational aspects make transform coding very attractive. In particular, transform coding is ubiquitous in image compression. For fine quantization of a Gaussian signal with known statistics, the Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) is optimal for transform coding <ref> [2] </ref>. In general, signal statistics are changing or not known a priori. Thus, one must either estimate the KLT from finite length blocks of the signal or use a fixed, signal independent transform. The former case is computationally intensive and transmission of the KLT coefficients can be prohibitively expensive. <p> Then the best codebook constrained quantizer for ff 0 can be found analytically <ref> [2] </ref>. The distribution of ff 1 given ^ff 0 is approximately uniform on [j ^ff 0 j; j ^ff 0 j]. Thus the optimal quantizer for ff 1 is uniform. We have yet to decide how to divide our bit rate between ^ff 0 and ^ff 1 .

Reference-contexts: A multitude of other families of frames can be found. For N = 3, 4, and 5, Hardin, Sloane and Smith have numerically found arrangements of up to 130 points on N -dimensional spheres that maximize the minimum Euclidean norm separation <ref> [3] </ref>. We refer to selecting one of these sets of points as "Method II". A third method is to consider the corners of the hypercube [ 1 p N ; 1 p N ] N . These form a set of 2 N symmetric points in R N . <p> The matching pursuit quantizer outperformed the independent quantizer up to a rate of 75 bits per vector (3 bits per source sample). Consider use of Method II. We select a dictionary of size eight in R 4 from <ref> [3] </ref>. from using matching pursuit with separate entropy coding of each index and each coefficient. The solid curve shows the improvement resulting from vector entropy coding of the indices. The "knees" in these curves correspond to rates at which the optimal number of coefficients to retain changes.

Reference-contexts: Let D = f' k g M k=1 H be a frame . We impose the additional constraint that jj' k jj = 1 8k. We will call D our dictionary of vectors. Matching pursuit <ref> [4] </ref> is an algorithm to represent f 2 H by a linear combination of elements of D. Furthermore, matching pursuit is an iterative scheme that at each step attempts to approximate f as closely as possible in a greedy manner.

Reference-contexts: As with any fixed transform, the DCT is nearly optimal for only a certain set of possible signals. There has been considerable work in the area of adaptively choosing a transform from a library of orthogonal transforms, for example, using wavelet packets <ref> [5] </ref>. All varieties of transform coding represent a signal vector as a linear combination of orthogonal basis vectors. In this paper, we present a method that represents a signal with respect to an overcomplete set of vectors which we call a dictionary. The representation is generated through greedy successive approximation.

Reference-contexts: These inequalities can be combined into " F # " 1 1 # The formulation (9) shows that ^x can be determined through linear programming <ref> [6] </ref>. An arbitrary cost function can be used. It is important to note that even if F fl F = AI N , 1 A F fl ^y is not, in general, a solution for ^x.

Reference-contexts: As an example, we will show that oversampling of a periodic, bandlimited signal can be viewed as a frame operator applied to the signal, where the frame operator is associated with a tight frame. If the samples are quantized, this is exactly the situation of oversampled A/D conversion <ref> [7] </ref>. Let x = [X 1 X 2 X N ] T 2 R N . <p> However, some results about the relationship between R and the MSE are known in the case of the frame operator F given in (6). Indeed, some partition properties were derived in <ref> [7] </ref>, using specifically the sampling interpretation of F . It was shown that for a given x 2 R N with certain conditions, the size of the partition cell in R N diminishes with R as O (1=R 2 ) in the MSE sense.

Reference-contexts: For convenience we assume that the reproduction values lie halfway between decision levels. Then for each i, j^y i y i j 2 . Given ^y, suppose we wish to find ^x such that Q [F ^x] = ^y. We refer to this as a consistent reconstruction <ref> [8] </ref>. Then for each i, we must have j (F ^x) i ^y i j 2 Expanding the absolute value, we find the constraints F ^x 2 1 + ^y (8) where = [ 1 : : : M ] T and the inequalities are elementwise.
